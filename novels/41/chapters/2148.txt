Chapter 2149 - Dao Yang Holy Son

Lin Yun swept his gaze and set his sights on An Liuyan after seeing that Ye Ziling was fine. He looked towards the Indigo Dragon Path and saw that Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan were protecting the throne well. No one was able to get close to An Liuyan. This made many people on the Indigo Dragon Path furious, but there was nothing they could do since they failed due to Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan being ruthless.

That was especially the case for Drifting Goblet. He might wear a smile and look amicable, but those who took a punch from him suffered heavy injuries to their internal organs. Some with a weaker physique would be in an even more miserable state as they threw out blood before they fell from the dragon mountain with their life and death unconfirmed.

Lin Yun gradually became uneasy because he knew that Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan must’ve received an order from Su Ziyao to do this, so this meant that Su Ziyao was here. Lin Yun then turned his gaze outside the dragon mountains but couldn’t see Su Ziyao anywhere. The more he couldn’t find Su Ziyao, the more uneasy he became.

That was especially the case after seeing Xin Yan and Bai Shuying standing by his sides. Thinking that Su Ziyao might be here, the corner of his lips began twitching.

“You’re nervous?” Bai Shuying asked.

“Not really,” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

“Don’t try to lie in front of a woman, not to mention that you’re not good at lying,” Xin Yan smiled. The two women naturally noticed that Lin Yun was feeling uneasy.

“Obediently stay here. Don’t even think about going to the Indigo Dragon Path. There are already people protecting her,” Bai Shuying said unhappily. To prevent Lin Yun from making a move, Bai Shuying and Xin Yan walked closer to him.

This only brought a bitter smile to Lin Yun’s lips, and this made him feel helpless. He could only turn his attention to Ji Zixi and He Xuanjing’s fight.

The fight was breathtaking, and many people were watching from outside the dragon mountains. As one of the Twin Stars, Ji Zixi had been enveloped in countless halos since young. On the other hand, He Xuanjing was the champion of a Heavenly Path. Even though the myth was shattered after Mu Qianjue’s defeat, no one dared to look down on them

The fight between the two was intense, and they had already exchanged over a few hundred moves in just a short moment. Ji Zixi took an aggressive approach as she basked in the Phoenix Sacred Flame. She grasped the Fire Dao and also possessed the pinnacle sixth-grade flame intent. Since her martial intent was empowered by saint dao, her martial intent dyed the sky in golden flames.

When her phoenix wings flapped, the surrounding space trembled, indicating that she had also grasped the Gale Dao. As wind and fire combined, they formed into ten-odd flaming tornadoes that devoured He Xuanjing.

He Xuanjing seemed to be struggling. Under the empowerment of the two saint daos, in addition to a bloodline secret technique like the Sacred Phoenix Wings, he looked to be in a disadvantageous position.

On the other hand, Ji Zixi looked more radiant as her robe revealed her legs and perfect figure. When the flames ignited, her face looked a little tender, as if she was glowing brightly, and no one could shift their eyes away from her. When she frowned with her tender face, she looked furious, but she gave everyone a feeling that she was adorable. It was hard for anyone not to take a fancy for someone like her.

“Ji Zixi is truly worthy of her reputation as one of the three beauties in the Kunlun Realm. Her beauty is really charming,” Lin Yun praised. He heard from Yue Weiwei that the three beauties of the Kunlun Realm were dream lovers of all men, and Ji Zixi was one of them.

But who knew that Xin Yan and Bai Shuying would look at him weirdly after hearing what he had said? Bai Shuying, in particular, said with disdain, “Ye Qingtian, do you really think that you’re a Holy Maiden Killer?”

Xin Yan smiled, “I think he enjoys the title a lot.”

Lin Yun coughed, then changed the topic, “But she lacks fighting experience. She’s been toyed around by He Xuanjing right from the beginning.”

“What do you mean by that?” Lin Yun’s words piqued Bai Shuyinhg’s interest.

Lin Yun replied, “He Xuanjing is smart. Right from the beginning, he gave Ji Zixi the illusion that if she exerted a little more force, she would be able to inflict heavy injuries on him. But He Xuanjing was dodging her attacks each time, building up Ji Zixi’s anger. So when Ji Zixi attacked again, he dodged again.”

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan immediately understood what Lin Yun meant. Lin Yun was saying that He Xuanjing showed a weakness to Ji Zixi, deliberately to exhaust the latter’s trump cards. But it didn’t look like it when they observed the fight.

This was because He Xuanjing’s face was pale, and he had already thrown out blood multiple times. If this was all an act, the price was a little too high.

But Lin Yun merely smiled. This was the advantage of geniuses from the lesser realms. They had ample experience in fighting, which wasn’t something the holy sons and holy maidens of the Kunlun Realm could compete with. Each champion crawled their way out from a mountain of corpses before reaching the end of the Heavenly Path.

“Compared to the Heavenly Paths, the Blue Dragon Record is nothing. Throwing out blood is nothing. In order to win, he can even throw out fragments of his internal organs,” Lin Yun smiled.

As soon as he said that, He Xuanjing threw out another mouthful of blood with fragments of his internal organs in it, looking like a broken kite that would fall the next moment.

This shocked Bai Shuying and Xin Yan, who then turned to look at Lin Yun. Even Lin Yun was surprised as he muttered, “I’m just talking about it casually. Does he really have to be so harsh on himself?”

Even Lin Yun wasn’t sure if He Xuanjing was acting now because it looked too real. He Xuanjing looked to be severely injured by Ji Zixi with his saint dao and saint aura shattered.

Seeing this, Ji Zixi heaved a sigh of relief because He Xuanjing was really a tough opponent. She had already exerted all her means, but He Xuanjing managed to avoid her attacks for so long.

“Is this the best the champion of a Heavenly Path has to offer?” Ji Zixi dashed forth, wanting to inflict the final blow. Her palm was fast, but Ji Zixi had doubt on her face just when her palm was about to come in contact with He Xuanjing’s chest.

When she injected her saint aura into his body, it felt as though her saint aura had gone into the sea, and there wasn’t any response. When she raised her head, she saw a smile on He Xuanjing’s face, and he didn’t look to be heavily injured at all.

This immediately made Ji Zixi’s face change as she knew that she had fallen for He Xuanjing’s trap, but it was already too late. The saint aura she injected into He Xuanjing’s body was bounced back to her. In the next second, fine cracks appeared on Ji Zixi’s right hand, and her entire arm was incapacitated.

She couldn’t even raise her arm, but that wasn’t the end. He Xuanjing pointed with his finger. His finger was followed by the cry of a crane and the golden flames in the sky shattered. A hole then appeared on Ji Zixi’s chest.

Ji Zixi threw out a mouthful of blood as she raised her head to see He Xuanjing’s cold expression. He Xuanjing looked like a fiendgod with countless ghosts wailing around him. This immediately frightened her with despair rising up, but she was unwilling to give up.

She clearly had a lot of means that she hadn’t used, but she lost because she wasn’t cautious. He Xuanjing didn’t give her the opportunity to catch her breath as he divided himself into two, forcibly tearing apart Ji Zixi’s Sacred Phoenix Wings.

Blood splashed from the sky, and He Xuanjing pushed his palm down from the sky. Ji Zixi had already fainted from the pain, so this scene left the geniuses from various holy lands shocked.

“He Xuanjing, stop!” They immediately became furious because He Xuanjing was too ruthless. He had already inflicted heavy injuries on Ji Zixi, but he still wanted to make a move when Ji Zixi couldn’t fight back.

This made them feel heartache as they soared to the sky, wanting to stop He Xuanjing.

“Coming at me together? You guys should’ve done that a long time ago,” He Xuanjing sneered as a crimson blade appeared in his hand. The blade looked like a terrifying demon, covered with patterns and a terrifying ominous aura spreading out.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Everyone outside the dragon mountains was shocked, and they finally realized that He Xuanjing had been hiding his strength.

“Blood Staining Sky!” He Xuanjing roared as he dashed forth, unafraid of the siege.

As thunder rumbled, He Xuanjing’s hair fluttered as he swung his blade, and no one could block more than three blades from him. It didn’t take long for everyone who dashed forth to take an attack from him and become covered in blood as they wailed on the ground in pain. This was too terrifying because his blade was his true trump card.

But Lin Yun noticed that He Xuanjing held back in his attacks. This was only the Blue Dragon Record, and He Xuanjing didn’t start a massacre. Otherwise, the ground would be covered in blood with mutilated corpses. He only spared their lives, but the injuries everyone suffered would render them bedridden for at least half a year.

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan flew out beside Lin Yun to catch onto Ji Zixi.

“Her injuries are serious.” Bai Shuying frowned.

Ji Zixi’s face was trembling despite the fact that she had fainted from the pain with blood gushing out from her chest. The wings behind her were broken, and the blood dyed her skin red.

“I can’t transmit my saint aura into her,” Xin Yan exclaimed in shock. The blade intent within Ji Zixi’s body was too terrifying, devouring all the saint aura she tried to pour into the latter’s body. As a result, Xin Yan couldn’t treat Ji Zixi’s injuries at all.

This immediately made Xin Yan and Bai Shuying panic because Ji Zixi might acquire hidden injuries if she didn’t have her injuries treated anytime soon.

“Scumbag, save her,” Lil’ Purple urged from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Why don’t I give it a try?” Lin Yun stepped forth.

While Lin Yun wanted to use the Blue Dragon Bone to treat Ji Zixi, there were no longer that many people left standing on the Dragon’s Head since He Xuanjing had defeated the majority by chopping them down like vegetables, scaring almost everyone who remained to leave the Dragon’s Head.

Suddenly, there was an unprecedented hindrance when He Xuanjing swung his sword down. His sword had clearly landed on his opponent’s body, but his opponent’s body gave He Xuanjing a feeling that it was even tougher than a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

When He Xuanjing raised his head, he saw a youth with messy hair standing before him. This youth was naturally the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Dao Yang Holy Son.

“I forgot that there’s another person in the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation,” He Xuanjing smiled after a brief stun.

“Is it that strange?” Dao Yang Holy Son made his move and threw his punch forth. His punch was like a bright sun that exploded before He Xuanjing, sending the latter flying away and crashing against a dragon’s horn.

When the golden radiance dissipated, the Dao Yang Holy Son slowly approached He Xuanjing with a darkened expression. His face was ugly and those who knew him well would be shocked. This was because it was rare for the Dao Yang Holy Son to be angry since he always looked cynical. But this time, the Dao Yang Holy Son was genuinely furious.
