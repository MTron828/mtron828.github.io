Chapter 2096: Tenth Transformation of the Nirvana Stage (2)

Lil’ Purple was watching from nearby. She was holding her breath, not daring to make a sound as she feared that an accident might happen with Lin Yun. But Lin Yun wouldn’t suffer any heavy injuries with the Divine Phoenix Leaf even if he failed in his breakthrough. But if Lin Yun gave up on himself, not even the Divine Phoenix Leaf could save his life.

“You have to hold on!” Lil’ Purple gritted her teeth as she looked at Lin Yun. She clenched the hem of her clothes, and her entire mind was on Lin Yun without her realizing it.

Suddenly, Lin Yun began to bleed from his seven orifices as his nirvana aura began to flow out of his body. He was in a dangerous situation.

“Lin Yun!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed.

Lin Yun’s face was pale as his head powerlessly dropped down. This was too terrifying, making Lil’ Purple’s face pale.

This meant Lin Yun’s breakthrough had reached a dangerous point; and yet Lin Yun was still holding onto the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet firmly with no intentions of letting it go. This was a sign that Lin Yun was still persevering.

Suddenly, sacred flames ignited on Lin Yun’s body, indicating that the Divine Phoenix Leaf was finally playing its role. A phoenix flew out from Lin Yun, and his body's wounds rapidly began to heal. At the same time, Lin Yun’s violet palace expanded as the stars within his violet palace increased from nine stars to ten stars!

This meant that Lin Yun had successfully reached the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage!

At the same time, Lin Yun’s nirvana aura also underwent a horrifying qualitative transformation that shone as brightly as saint radiance. An aura comparable to a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase exploded from Lin Yun. As the ten stars revolved within his violet palace, Lin Yun’s nirvana aura turned crimson, looking like blood and containing a powerful life force.

“The Samsara Edict Realm… The tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage is the real?samsara…” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked because when the ten stars revolved within his violet palace, his nirvana aura had a sacred and mysterious energy like a Phoenix that underwent nirvana. He was excited and wanted to see how powerful the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage was. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!” Lin Yun soared to the sky with his crimson nirvana aura filling his body. As his body heated up, he was like a molten iron burning at the top of a volcano, looking sacred while hovering in the sky.

When Lin Yun unleashed the Sovereign Dragon Seal, space cracked and the entire Iris Secret Realm was trembling.

“What power!” Lin Yun landed on the ground while happily looking at his hands. “My nirvana aura is now capable of facing saint aura head-on!”

Lin Yun was surprised and excited. After all, he had been afraid of Quasi-Saints for a long time. This was because he was powerless before saint aura. Nirvana aura and saint aura weren’t the same. Saint aura was on a completely different level. That’s why Lin Yun could do nothing against saint aura, even with his powerful foundation.

It was like how wood couldn't be compared with metal in toughness. As a result, Lin Yun could only rely on his heaven-defying sword intent to suppress his opponent’s martial intent when facing opponents at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Even so, that didn’t resolve the problem because saint aura could still injure him, and he would be heavily injured if he took an attack containing saint aura head-on. But it was entirely different this time because his nirvana aura could now face saint aura head-on, and he could resist if saint aura was injected into his body. This was simply too unbelievable!

“Hehe, the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. You’ve accomplished something impressive, Lin Yun. Even in ancient times, you could be considered a monstrous genius, not any weaker than Iris. I’m amazed by your willpower, and you’re a man worthy of defending the glory of the sword dao.” A bright and beautiful smile bloomed on Lil’ Purple’s tender yet flawless face. She gave rare praise to Lin Yun while walking towards Lin Yun with a light breeze.

Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple, and smiled, “It’s all thanks to the Divine Phoenix Leaf. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to recover so quickly, even if I successfully made a breakthrough. Without the Divine Phoenix Leaf, I might have failed my breakthrough.”

“Do you know how powerful I am now? The Divine Phoenix Leaf is a true treasure. The True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet given by your senior sister is powerful, but it’s still lacking in comparison to my Divine Phoenix Leaf,” Lil’ Purple said pridefully.

Lin Yun opened his mouth, but couldn’t help smiling. Lil’ Purple hadn’t even seen his senior sister before and yet she wanted to compete with her.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?” Lil’ Purple puffed her cheeks, seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t saying anything.

“Yeah, you’re right,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, that’s for sure. What are your plans now? There are less than four months before the Blue Dragon Record appears. I’m afraid the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage still isn’t enough. You should try and reach complete mastery with your Astral Sword Intent.”

“I have that intention, but even by relying on the Great Solar Saint Pellets and Great Lunar Saint Pellets it won't be easy. The key is my dual sword stars,” Lin Yun said. Compared to his powerful Astral Sword Intent, Lin Yun’s biggest trump card was the dual sword stars.

There must be geniuses who’ve grasped the Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery or even higher, such as Mu Xuankong, the sect master of the Sword Sect. But his dual sword stars were unique to him; that was his strongest trump card. But he didn’t know how to cultivate or fully excavate their potential.

“I can’t help you with that. But the Heavenly Dao Sect has existed since before ancient times. So even if no one has grasped dual sword stars in recent history, there must be records about it,” Lil’ Purple analyzed.

Lin Yun held onto his chin and said, “You’re right. It looks like I’ll have to take a trip to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The foundation and inheritance of the Heavenly Dao Sect are there.”

Lin Yun wouldn’t hesitate the moment he made up his mind. After leaving Indigothunder Peak, Lin Yun headed directly to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. He was the direct disciple of a Great Saint, and no one would stop him as long as he didn’t enter the core realm of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

Time could be slowed down within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. A year inside was only equivalent to two or three days in the outside world. Of course, Lin Yun knew that it wasn’t genuinely slowing down time after hearing what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint said. It was an ‘illusion’ because traces of time could still be found on his body. If one didn’t have enough lifespan, they might even lose their life as they cultivated within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

Thus, this made Lin Yun even more cautious about it. He already used the Three-Lives Fruit multiple times, so it was best for him not to use any time and space treasures before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

A voice resounded behind him as he came to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. “Ye Qingtian, you’re finally going to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?”

Lin Yun didn’t even have to guess to know that it must be the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan walked up with a smile, “What’s the matter? You can’t recognize me now?”

“Holy Maiden, you must be joking,” Lin Yun replied.

“The Blue Dragon Record is arriving soon, and I plan to cultivate within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. I initially thought time would be boring inside, but it looks like it’ll be interesting with you around,” Wang Muyan smiled.

She wasn’t surprised that Ye Qingtian was planning to use the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, since there were less than four months left before the appearance of the Blue Dragon Record. If Ye Qingtian wanted to transform, he could only reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, and using the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda could allow him to make a breakthrough in the shortest time possible.

She didn’t seem to know what had happened and was responding as usual.
