Chapter 1815 - I'll Protect Lin Xiao!

“The Black Tortoise’s inheritance really appeared?” Lin Yun was surprised. All along, there were only rumors about the inheritance in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. Some people even managed to obtain some incomplete inheritance, but no one saw the actual inheritance. Thus, many people considered it a legend, and Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered by it. So he was naturally shocked when the inheritance appeared so smoothly.

Nodding his head, Gu Jun replied, “An underground palace rose from the Dead Sea, and all the phenomena on the Black Tortoise Void Sea recently came from it. Everyone is on Profound Thunder Island now. It is the island closest to the Dead Sea. Further ahead is the forbidden zone of the Dead Sea.”

Lin Yun raised his brow, and asked, “What’s the meaning of this? No one dares to enter the Dead Sea.”

Gulping down a mouthful of wine, Gu Jun smiled, “That’s why everyone is waiting for something to happen. Since the underground palace appeared, there’s a high chance it will allow everyone to enter.”

Lin Yun felt more suspicious when he saw Gu Jun’s confident tone. He asked, “Speaking of which, why have you come? I remember you’re at the pinnacle of the Samsara Edict Realm, and you can enter the Quasi-Saint Realm at any time. Isn’t it a little too dangerous for you to be here?”

The Black Tortoise Void Sea had the lingering power of deities, and it might detonate if someone with a high cultivation showed up. If they revealed their strength, those with a higher cultivation would die faster.

“It’s the Black Tortoise’s inheritance we’re talking about. The inheritance here should be the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage, and there will surely be a lot of good wine buried in the underground palace that isn’t at all inferior to your Dragon Clan’s wines.”

As a light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he questioned, “Thunder Black Tortoise? Why are you so knowledgeable about it? Old man, don’t tell me you’re a descendant of the Black Tortoise’s lineage.”

Previously, when they talked, he could tell Gu Jun had done a lot of research on the Black Tortoise’s lineage, and he even knew the origin of the Black Tortoise’s lineage. He was already suspicious at that time and even asked about it jokingly, but Gu Jun immediately brushed it off.

He didn’t put it in his mind back then, but Gu Jun sounded so confident and even said it should be the Thunder Black Tortoise’s inheritance. He had never read about it before on the bamboo scroll he bought. As for wines hidden in the underground palace, there was also no trace of them being mentioned.

“I’m not. Don’t bullshit!” Gu Jun immediately became nervous and quickly denied it.

“Alright, let us pretend that you’re not. Let me ask you, have you heard of the Black Turtle Ancestor?” Lin Yun smiled, and Gu Jun’s reaction further confirmed his speculation.

“Why are you asking about it?” Gu Jun immediately became vigilant.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Nothing much. I’m only asking about it casually.” Lin Yun said. The Black Turtle Ancestor once told him that he could go look for him if he was interested in the Black Tortoise’s inheritance, but Lin Yun didn’t even know where the Black Turtle Ancestor was located.

Gu Jun turned his gaze away, and didn’t dare to look Lin Yun straight in the eyes. He said, “I do know something, but I heard the Black Turtle Ancestor is outside the Eastern Sea, in the Black Tortoise Ancestral Land. I heard there are pure-blooded Black Tortoises there.”

“What’s with the Thunder Black Tortoise, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“Didn’t I tell you before? The Black Tortoise Clan are descendants of the Black Tortoise after uniting with humans. They aren’t the only Black Tortoise’s descendants. The Black Tortoise’s lineage has seven branches. Each branch is of a different attribute. There’s the Thunder Black Tortoise, Flame Black Tortoise, Ice Black Tortoise… and the strongest are the Heaven Black Tortoise and Earrth Black Tortoise.”

“It sounds pretty complicated.” Lin Yun sighed after hearing what Gu Jun said.

“Well, there’s no other way. Amongst the four divine beasts, the Black Tortoise has the strongest lust…” Gu Jun flung his lips to the side. As he spoke, he immediately stopped when he realized he had a slip of the tongue.

When Lin Yun sent a weird look at Gu Jun, the latter’s face turned red, and he argued, “Don’t look at me. I don’t have the Black Tortoise’s bloodline.”

“That’s not important. Let’s get to the Profound Thunder Island first.” Lin Yun said. He knew that everyone must have gathered there, including those from the demonic path. With the appearance of the Demonfeather Order, it would naturally attract a lot of demonic cultivators.

Aside from that, the Blood Moon Sect was also hiding in the dark. The three God Generals have gathered together, wanting to take revenge for the shame they suffered. But everyone gathered there was interested in the Black Tortoise’s inheritance, since this was a huge opportunity. If they had a harvest, they would be able to rise.

But the Dead Sea was too dangerous, and they wouldn’t dare to enter even if they had a hundred guts. So they were now waiting for a reaction from the underground palace.

When Lin Yun and Gu Jun came to Profound Thunder Island, their appearance immediately caused a commotion.

“Isn’t that Lin Xiao, the champion of the Nirvana Banquet? He has a bounty on his head, and he dares to show up here in public?”

“Who’s the old man beside him? He looks so wretched.”

“Lin Xiao is too bold. He’s only first on the Dragon Pulse Realm, but everyone here is an expert at the Profound Life Stage. Isn’t he courting death to come here?” Lin Yun and Gu Jun’s appearance attracted a lot of attention. But most people didn’t dare to make a move against him out of his identity as a genius from the Azure Dragon’s lineage. At the very least, not blatantly.

But the experts on the Demonic Ranking didn’t have that much consideration, and demonic cultivators would soon arrive.

“You really have dragged me down. I told you to put on a bamboo hat. I just want some wine, and I don’t want any trouble…” Gu Jun lowered his head with his pupils flickering, wondering if he should sneak away now.

“There’s no need.” Lin Yun replied indifferently. The Demonfeather Order was a headache, but he couldn’t keep hiding from it. At the very least, he had to resolve it here somehow, and the best way would be to make an example out of a few people.

The reason why he didn’t wear a bamboo hat to conceal himself was that he didn’t think anyone here could kill him. He could even put up a fight against an expert at the Profound Life Stage. At the very least, no one could leave him behind if he wanted to leave riding on his sword.

A group of people appeared, immediately blocking his way. There were over a few hundred people, and they were all demonic cultivators on the Demonic Ranking. Those who could make it on the ranking weren’t afraid of death, and their hands were drenched in the blood of holy land disciples.

Three people stood out from the crowd, and they were the ones Lin Yun met back on the saint-class warship. They were Kou Tianhua, Yuan Hengying, and Lady Stone. Behind them were several demonic cultivators on the ranking as well, and they were all at the third stage Profound Life Stage.

But because Kou Tianhua stood out, they had no intention of standing out. Kou Tianhua’s master was the Whitebone Blade Saint. Aside from that, he was also ranked in the top three-hundreds on the Demonic Ranking. His cultivation was at the pinnacle of the fifth stage Profound Life Stage. He belonged to the top of the food chain, even in the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and no one would dare to provoke him.

“Kou Tianhua, I already asked you to get lost on the saint-class warship, and yet you still dare to appear before me,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

The surroundings broke into an uproar, and they were shocked by what Lin Yun said. After all, Lin Yun acted as though the Demonfeather Order had nothing to do with him.

Kou Tianhua was stunned, standing in his white robe for a while, before he laughed, “Lin Xiao, you’re really arrogant! I have been waiting for you for two months, and I thought you were already dead. But you’re still alive. Good!”

“I won’t die even if you do. Get lost, don’t block my sight.” Lin Yun said coldly. He wasn’t polite with Kou Tianhua, since he didn’t have a need to be. The demonic cultivators were here for his life to exchange for the Demonfeather Order. So he would only make himself seem weak if he spoke with a soft stance.

On the other hand, Gu Jun was terrified because he came here after sealing his cultivation. If he fought and the power accidentally exceeds the Profound Life Stage, he would instantly attract the power of deities. Others might be able to come out unscathed, but he would take the blow head-on and die.

“Brother Kou, I don’t know this brat well. You can just go after him, since it has nothing to do with me.” Gu Jun even addressed Kou Tianhua as a ‘brother’ for someone of his age, which was eye-opening for Lin Yun.

“Get lost.” Kou Tianhua said, and a murderous aura swept out from him. For so many years, no one dared to speak to him in this manner.

“Senior Gu, you’re being too modest. Didn’t you tell me the Whitebone Blade Saint was just a dog? So why are you being so polite now?” Lin Yun smiled. “We previously agreed that we’d kill all the demonic cultivators on Profound Thunder Island and use their heads to exchange for money.”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that. They began to wonder about the origin of this old man, and many demonic cultivators turned to look at Gu Jun with fury.

Before Gu Jun could refute, Lin Yun pulled him behind and smiled, “I understand. This garbage isn’t worthy of you to make a move. Kou Tianhua, come and kneel if you want an easy death. Otherwise, I’ll make you suffer worse than death.”

Behind Kou Tianhua, Lady Stone and Yuan Hengying looked at each other with strange expressions. After all, wasn’t that their line?

“Young Master, there’s something weird about this brat. Why don’t we get someone to probe his strength first?” Yuan Hengying whispered.

“You think I’m afraid of him? I’ll crush him to death now! First on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? He’s nothing before me!” Kou Tianhua roared, unleashing a terrifying murderous aura. As a boundless crimson aura spread out, everyone could hear the resentful howls coming from it.

Everyone’s faces changed, and they quickly backed away. They had no idea how many people Kou Tianhua had killed for him to possess such a powerful baleful aura.

When their eyes fell on Lin Yun, their pupils were filled with sympathy because they knew that Lin Yun was doomed. The Black Tortoise Void Sea was different from the outside world, and demonic cultivators didn’t have any reservations here. So it was normal for them to be unscrupulous.

“Stop!” A roar echoed, shattering the baleful aura that was released by Kou Tianhua. As a figure descended on the ground, that person looked around with contempt before he declared, “If anyone dares to touch Lin Xiao while we’re on Profound Thunder Island, they’ll be going against me, Mei Zihua. Anyone who touches him will die!”

The surroundings immediately broke into an uproar. This was simply insane because this person was even more arrogant than Lin Xiao.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he saw Mei Zihua. This fellow showed up at the Martial Dao Tea Party, saying that the champion of the Nirvana Banquet should be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Now, he appeared again and disrupted his plan to intimidate the demonic cultivators.

Simultaneously, a person wearing a bamboo hat was hiding in the dark, staring at Lin Yun. This person was someone who was on the same Black Tortoise Ship as Lin Yun. They had all unknowingly gathered together, aside from the mysterious woman.

“Kou Tianhua, I’m determined to protect Lin Xiao. So give me face and don’t bother him.” Mei Zihua said indifferently.

But the response to him was a huge palm that even shattered the sky, and Kou Tianhua roared, “Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you speak to me in this manner! Get lost!”
