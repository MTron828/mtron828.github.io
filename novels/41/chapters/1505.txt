Chapter 1506 - Golden Crow Wings Rebirth

The boiling Divine Golden Crow Iron looked like blazing flames and was emitting a dazzling brilliance. The dazzling light alone proved how extraordinary the Divine Golden Crow Iron was. The Divine Golden Crow Iron was created from soil containing the divine blood while condensing for tens of thousands of years before there was a slight chance of it being born.

It was both a metal and liquid, and it could even give birth to intelligence if time was long enough. Lin Yun finally made up his mind and the liquid Divine Golden Crow Iron entered his body like flowing magma.

He instantly felt excruciating pain and let out a roar with golden flames blazing in his pupils. His bones began to turn red like a metal that was being forged at high temperature in the furnace, glowing with uncertain crimson as if it would explode the next moment.

This was terrifying because he could feel that his body was under a high temperature and it felt as though his internal organs and bones would melt. The 30,000-foot astral energy ocean also began to boil in his violet palace, igniting the boundless astral energy.

As waves of dazzling golden starlight shone from his body, the eight thousand dragon runes were like seals that were empowering his body. No matter how terrifying the Divine Golden Crow Iron was, it couldn‚Äôt destroy his body. The dragon runes strengthened his blood, bones, and internal organs, and his body was like a quasi-dragon physique at this moment.

As his heart was pumping, he could feel boundless vitality surging and turning into brimming vitality. But even so, Lin Yun‚Äôs thoughts were in chaos as the pain consumed him.

Four hours later, a chill flowed in his mind, and he came to his senses. The chill quickly flowed throughout his body, allowing him to lower his head to look at the pendant. The Heavenly Heart Jade Talisman given to him by An Liuyan allowed him to come to his senses in this crucial moment.

If it wasn‚Äôt for that, he might not have come to his senses for several days. At that time, it would be a question if he could still refine the Divine Golden Crow Iron.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun closed his eyes to calm his emotions. After careful observation, he noticed that the Divine Golden Crow Iron had dissolved into light throughout his body, filling it entirely.

It was as if golden sand was burning every inch of his body, but the pain had become milder.

Sitting with his legs crossed, Lin Yun put his hands together and started forming seals. When he formed the seals, the astral energy ocean coursed through his body and the Divine Sunchasing Art was being circulated.

The golden sand gathered to his back as he circulated the Divine Sunchasing Art. This was a painful process, covering Lin Yun‚Äôs forehead with sweat.

But since Lin Yun‚Äôs eyes were closed, he had no idea that all of his sweat was blood droplets, and they were blazing when they fell onto the ground, turning the surroundings into a sea of flames. He was like a young sun in the sea of fire, with an ancient aura enveloping him.

When the phenomenon appeared outside, even An Liuyan and Xiao Yun sensed that something wasn‚Äôt right. They could hear saintly music and see golden light coming from the nine-layered spiritual array.

Boundless vitality was pouring down in the form of drizzling rain. The rain soon dampened the desert and all sorts of plants began to grow on the ground.

‚ÄúW-What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù An Liuyan reached out towards the rain, her eyes filled with doubt.

‚ÄúWhy does it feel like an auspicious beast is about to be born? This is bizarre. Just what did Big Brother Lin refine?‚Äù Xiao Yun said in a surprised tone. Suddenly, his face changed, ‚ÄúNot good!‚Äù

This place was remote, with the surroundings being a desert. There might not be anyone around, but demonic beasts were around.

Turning back, they could see boundless demonic beasts attracted by this phenomenon. Amongst them were demonic beasts comparable to eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts, and some gave off an aura equivalent to nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

Facing those demonic beasts, even someone like Ku Ying would have difficulty.

‚ÄúThis is troublesome now!‚Äù Xiao Yun muttered.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a move. These are only demonic beasts, and it‚Äôs not as unpredictable as you think!‚Äù An Liuyan was decisive and attacked. When a cloth flew out like a bolt of lightning, it easily sent a demonic beast flying away.

Unless it was an overlord demonic beast or a monarch demonic beast, cultivators generally had the advantage against demonic beasts in the same cultivation.

Xiao Yun was also a decisive person. He might sound like a coward, but he was even more ruthless than An Liuyan when he made his move. But there were too many demonic beasts, and it didn‚Äôt take long for them to fall into a bitter fight. The phenomenon created by Lin Yun was just too great.

Within the nine-layered spiritual array, six hours passed by. The Divine Golden Crow Iron that filled his body finally gathered on his back, and the speed of Lin Yun forming signs with his hands gradually slowed down.

His back was heavy, and it felt like he was carrying a mountain on it. When a crisp sound echoed, it was as if a golden crow was breaking out from a cocoon and Lin Yun‚Äôs back was ripped apart with blood spilling out.

A pair of golden metallic wings grew out from his back. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he fell to one knee with his right hand on the ground, supporting him. His face was rosy, and his eyes flashed with golden light as flames blazed within the depths of his pupils.

When the Golden Crow Wings were fully formed, Lin Yun rose from the ground to the air. The Golden Crow Wings were nearly thirty feet long and glowed brightly like the sun. Every single feather had a metallic sheen, and the newly born Golden Crow Wings flowed with a faint light that was incomparable to before.

Looking at it carefully, the holy flames were the Golden Crow Saint Flame that was blazing within the Divine Golden Crow Iron. Each feather was engraved with a saint rune, which meant that each feather was comparable to a saint artifact. There were more than 20,000 feathers on the Golden Crow Wings, which was close to thirty meters long.

In other words, the newly born Golden Crow Wings was equivalent to a saint artifact with 20,000 saint runes. The Golden Crow Wings flapped with a single thought, and he began to shuttle back and forth in this space.ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

He turned into golden streaks of light as he teleported back and forth. When he stopped, the golden streaks were still left behind in the air and not dissipating.

‚ÄúWhat speed!‚Äù Lin Yun‚Äôs eyes flashed with excitement. He was several times faster than before, and this was unbelievable. But he soon suppressed his emotions and crossed his hands to form the Golden Crow Saint Seal, pouring his astral energy into the wings behind him.

As the Golden Crow Wings trembled like a couple of blades, the 20,000 saint runes began to activate and enveloped Lin Yun in a golden light. As he activated more and more saint runes, the light that Lin Yun was emitting grew even more dazzling.

Just when he was curious about what was about to happen, a dazzling radiance shone from Lin Yun, and the nine-layered spiritual array was utterly destroyed in a split second. When the spiritual array crumbled, the surrounding air violently trembled.

The commotion drew An Liuyan and Xiao Yun‚Äôs attention, who were fighting the demonic beasts. When they turned back, they couldn‚Äôt help to be shocked when they saw a person suspended in the air and devouring all the light in the world. This person was bathed in a holy light, making him look like a god.

When Lin Yun appeared before An Liuyan, he folded his wings to protect himself. Two eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts charged forth and collided, creating a loud and dull sound.

The two demonic beasts were dizzy from the collision, and the Golden Grow Wings unfolded before they could come to their senses. The two wings were like a couple of blades that severed the two demonic beasts into pieces.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù This scene completely stumped Xiao Yun. After all, those were eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts, and he was curious about what Lin Yun had refined for his wings to become so terrifying. Even someone as knowledgeable as him couldn‚Äôt believe what he was seeing.

But he soon felt sad because Lin Yun chose women over brothers. He was facing nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts, and there was more than one of them!

Just when Xiao Yun was inwardly complaining, Lin Yun finally moved, turning into a streak of light while shuttling across the battlefield. Whenever he stopped, an eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beast would be torn into pieces.

Just like that, twenty-odd eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts died in the blink of an eye.

When the golden light stopped beside Xiao Yun, Xiao Yun‚Äôs face had already turned pale with fright. When Lin Yun appeared beside him, he didn‚Äôt say a word and summoned the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to his hand.

Pouring the dragon runes into the umbrella, the Golden Crow Wings flapped when Lin Yun thrust the umbrella, using it as a sword. The nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beast was instantly torn apart when the umbrella stabbed it at an unprecedented speed.

As for the two remaining nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts, they fled without turning back and no longer dared to stay behind.

With a single thought, Lin Yun recalled the Golden Crow Wings into his body and looked at the umbrella before falling into deep thoughts. His clothes gradually regenerated and spiritual runes flickered on the clothes that the Golden Crow Wings tore apart. Even the ordinary garments he wore were at least a dao artifact for someone at his cultivation.

As long as the clothes weren‚Äôt instantly destroyed, they would regenerate by themselves. He had a feeling that he could give opening the umbrella a try again. The umbrella looked weird, engraved with the sun, moon, river, mountains, dragons, and starry sky. Opening it felt like opening a world instead of an umbrella.

When Lin Yun turned around, Xiao Yun still hadn‚Äôt recovered from his shock, and he could feel his lips becoming dry as he looked at Lin Yun like he was looking at a monster. A long time later, he gulped down a mouthful of saliva and asked, ‚ÄúBig Brother Lin, what did you refine?‚Äù

‚ÄúDivine Golden Crow Iron.‚Äù Lin Yun replied.

His words left Xiao Yun and An Liuyan shocked for a moment before they came to their senses. Xiao Yun asked, ‚ÄúBut, where did you get the Divine Golden Crow Iron from?‚Äù

An Liuyan‚Äôs eyes were surprised because not even the chief disciples of the seven demonic sects would have such a treasure. After all, not even saints would be willing to give such a treasure to their descendants because the value wasn‚Äôt at all inferior to a Divine Dragon Bone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I‚Äôm the Sword Sect‚Äôs Lin Yun, the heaven direct disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak!‚Äù Lin Yun smiled.

Xiao Yun scratched his head in confusion. Only Mu Xuankong knew the immense pressure he was under when he gave Lin Yun the Divine Golden Crow Iron. But Lin Yun didn‚Äôt dwell on this problem and returned the pendant to An Liuyan.

An Liuyan wore the pendant. Just when she was about to say something, a streak of light flew over and entered her interspatial bracelet. When she took out the jade slip and placed it against her forehead, she received news from others.

When she reopened her eyes, her gaze became weird.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Lin Yun asked.

‚ÄúThe first envoy says that the seven demonic sects have found a way to deal with the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and they‚Äôre preparing to launch an attack at the Dragon Burial Valley. So all of the envoys are to gather immediately.‚Äù An Liuyan said.

When Lin Yun and Xiao Yun heard that, they were both surprised. There is a way to enter the Dragon Burial Valley now?
