Chapter 1730 – Approaching Banquet

Lin Yun watched as Gu Jun took out two delicate strings from the box. When Lin Yun briefly sensed them, he knew that the strings were light, and he couldn’t see any traces of it being dragon tendons. After being refined by a Heavenly Spiritualist, the essence of the dragon tendons was preserved and made into perfect strings. But it was also made according to his request, and the strings were thicker than those meant for the lute.

“They’re really the ancient dragon tendons.” Lin Yun said. He could sense an ancient dragon aura from the strings. Since he possessed the Blue Dragon Bone and Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he was sensitive to that. Compared to dragon bones, the dragon tendons were a lot more valuable. This was because dragon tendons were more challenging to find than divine dragon bones, since they were hard to preserve.

“Why do you need this for?” Gu Jun looked at Lin Yun doubtfully. He then took out another item and asked, “And this bow is weird. What is this for?”

“You don’t have to care about that.” Lin Yun took the bow and briefly looked at it before he exclaimed, “Divine Dragon Wood?!”

He was shocked that the bow was made of Divine Dragon Wood. Although the value of the Divine Dragon Wood couldn’t be compared to the Divine Mulberry Wood, it could still be considered a precious divine wood.

“Ha. Why do you think it took so long? That lass didn’t even question your request and immediately went to make preparations.” Gu Jun glared at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t bother with Gu Jun and took out the erhu before slowly placing the strings. This was his first time doing this, so he was having some difficulty.

“Let me take over. I can tell with a glance that your hands are meant for the sword.” Gu Jun looked at Lin Yun with disdain. He snatched the erhu and strings from him. It didn’t take long for him to install the strings on the erhu.

“So this is what you’re planning. But this has been long lost since ancient times, and no one knows how to play it. I’m afraid you’re busy in vain if you’re trying to use it as a trump card at the banquet…” Gu Jun smiled with disappointment before handing the erhu to Lin Yun.

“Who says that it cannot be played?” Lin Yun placed the bow on the strings before he pulled it left and right.

A tone that Lin Yun had never heard before resounded from the erhu. The sound was filled with desolation, sounding like sobbings. Gu Jun had never heard of such a tone before, and he was instantly stumped. He looked at Lin Yun with disbelief because not only could Lin Yun play it, but he was playing an ancient score he had never heard before. The song could make others feel sorrow, and Gu Jun was sure that it was a song specially meant for the erhu.

Lowering the bow, Lin Yun’s pupils shone brightly, “It really works.”

“What… song is this? Isn’t this instrument long lost? So how did you manage to do it?” Gu Jun nearly went insane and asked when Lin Yun stopped.

“Moon Reflection.” Lin Yun replied. This was the name of this song. He had listened to it before and shouldn’t be able to remember it. But after grasping music dao, he became sensitive to various songs from his previous life and could easily recall them. He could even complement the incomplete portions with his attainment.

But this was only a small test, and Lin Yun had a bigger ambition. This erhu was forged with Divine Mulberry Wood, so it might be perfect if he played the Heavenly Mulberry Score with it.

“You’re simply a genius!” Gu Jun praised, looking at Lin Yun.

“This isn’t enough. My foundation in music dao is too low, and my flaws will be magnified if I fall into a stalemate with other Grand Musicians.” Lin Yun shook his head. He was calm and knew that the erhu could only be used as a trump card. So he couldn’t put all his stake in it.

If he wanted it to be a failsafe, he would need to make another breakthrough in the Divine Phoenix Touch, and it was best for him to reach the Phoenix Nirvana Stage. Since he still had time before the banquet, Lin Yun still wasn’t in a hurry.

So he might as well wait in Gu Jun’s abode. In the beginning, he performed the Heavenly Mulberry Score with the zither before switching to the erhu, then seeking advice from Gu Jun. The Saint Tone was divided into nine grades and also at different stages. They were the Saint, Great Saint, and Saint King Tones.

The difference between the three wasn’t too different because every three grades was a stage in the former, and the stages were named the latter. Gu Jun’s attainment had long reached the Saint King Tone, and he was only one step away from the Imperial Tone. But his attainment in music dao was stuck in the same spot for a long time. But he was more than enough to guide Lin Yun.

Gu Jun learned a lot during his interaction with Lin Yun, and their interactions became even more of a rapport.

“Old Gu, what’s the Great Saint Tone?” Lin Yun asked.

As Gu Jun caressed the erhu, he smiled, “Saint Tone can allow music to manifest into the wind wandering throughout the world. It could perfectly display the phenomenon contained within the score, and it is also called the Saint Wind.

“Great Saint Tone bestows life to music; each musical note is an individual soul. Even when the musical note dissipates, the music will still linger and overlap. The phenomena you create possesses a life that appears as though they truly existed. For example…” Gu Jun explained as he started playing with the erhu. Each musical note was transparent.

When the musical notes gradually dissipated, they sounded like rumbling thunder within Lin Yun’s ears, making his body tremble. But before he could come to his senses, a new musical note was born. As the remnant musical notes overlapped, they caused the surroundings to start trembling.

“Hahaha! This is satisfying! This instrument forged by the Divine Mulberry Wood is excellent stuff. Forget it. Let me show you what the Saint King Tone is!” Gu Jun’s hair fluttered in the wind, and the musical notes played with the erhu changed.

When a storm appeared, heaven and earth began to tremble. Lin Yun’s face changed, and he crossed his arms before him. But when he hesitated for a moment, he was knocked flying away by the aura that Gu Jun gave off. When he landed on the ground, he raised his head, and Gu Jun’s aura reached a horrifying height.

There was a pack of horses galloping behind him, and the tone of his music was captivating. This shocked Lin Yun because he realized that he never actually saw through this old man. This old man was normally a miser who shamelessly conned him of his Profound Saint Pellets. But judging from the aura he gave off now, it made Lin Yun feel that this wasn’t the same person. It was like how Gu Jun gave Liu Chenxin a beating back on the streets, overbearing and unreasonable.

As a thirteenth-grade Saint Spiritualist, pinnacle Nirvana Stage, and acquiring the Saint King Tone, Lin Yun was shocked to discover he had belittled Gu Jun. He previously thought that not even a Quasi-Saint could do anything to Gu Jun. But now that he looked at him again, even an ordinary Saint Lord might not be able to suppress him. This instantly made Lin Yun wonder if Gu Jun had an origin.

“How is it?” Gu Jun looked at Lin Yun.

“Not bad.” Lin Yun was shocked, but his face was calm.

“You had eyes but couldn't see Mt. Tai! Only Saint Elder and the pavilion master are qualified to say that to me in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Saint Elder is younger than you, and she’s already a Quasi-Saint. Not to mention she even grasped the Imperial Tone.” Lin Yun said.

“You’ll anger me to death sooner or later.” Gu Jun lowered the erhu. “Don’t you have some conscience?”

Lin Yun smiled, and he continued to get familiar with the zither. When he used his Divine Phoenix Touch to play the Phoenix Heart Song, his fingers rapidly danced on the zither, and his figure became blurred. His music also became weird, and it looked as though there were a few more people.

There were nine afterimages on the Thunderstorm Zither, and a phoenix cry echoed from within his body. When the music combined and reached a new height, intense flames suddenly ignited on the surface of his body. Accompanied by a phoenix cry, a phoenix flew to the sky from Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief, he muttered, “I’ve finally reached greater mastery in the Divine Phoenix Touch.”

But if Lil’ Purple were still around, she would definitely reprimand him, and Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling while thinking about it. He began to wonder how Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red were doing. The Myriad Demon Peak was a forbidden zone; even a Saint Lord’s life would be in danger if they entered.

“Don’t forget about our promise to meet in the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lin Yun stowed the Thunderstorm Zither and stepped forth, holding the erhu and bow. Before he left, he briefly pondered before leaving behind a Dragon Clan’s wine and several Profound Saint Pellets. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When dusk came, and Gu Jun returned, he was briefly stunned when he saw the Dragon Clan’s wine and Profound Saint Pellets on the table before he smiled, “At least he has some conscience.”

The Nirvana Banquet was seven days away, so Lin Yun made another trip to the summit of the snowy mountain. As snowflakes danced on the lake, Yue Weiwei practiced the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.

The Nine Heavenly Profound Dance was complicated, and even with Lin Yun’s Ni Chang Dress Song, Yue Weiwei only managed to master the first fifteen sections of the dance. She still hadn’t grasped the last three sections.

The Nine Heavenly Profound Dance could be considered a high-grade dragon spirit martial technique and had a high requirement for talent. With Yue Weiwei’s current cultivation, it was already heaven-defying that she could achieve this much. Regardless of the pavilion master or Saint Elder, they were strict with Yue Weiwei, and he never saw them praising her.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s footsteps stopped because a blue-robed youth was standing together with Mu Xueling. The blue-robed youth suddenly turned around with his gaze on Lin Yun, and Lin Yun also managed to see the latter’s appearance. The blue-clothed youth had exquisite features, and he gave off an ethereal temperament.

He speculated this must be the chief disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. When he walked over, the blue-robed youth examined him before saying, “I heard from Saint Elder that you’re assisting Junior Sister with the Ni Chang Dress Song in this period?”

“Do you have a problem with that?” Lin Yun replied.

The blue-robed youth was briefly stunned and raised his brow. But a smile soon appeared on his face because this newcomer was a little impulsive.
