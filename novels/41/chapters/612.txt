Chapter 613 - Blood Essence of the Azure Dragon

The Azure Dragon Enneaform was an intermediate earth grade body-refining technique with wind and lightning attributes. This meant he had to have some attainments in wind and lightning in order to learn the technique.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to complete the first two stages within two hours. But Lin Yun had some confidence since this was a body-refining technique. He practiced the Thunderblitz Battle Physique when he was in Xiantian Realm and the Dracophant Battle Physique while in the Profound Martial Realm. Moreover, the latter only had six stages but he broke through the limit and reached the unprecedented seventh stage.

In terms of comprehension of the lightning attribute, Lin Yun knew that he was inferior to Guo Xu. But in terms of physique, he had surpassed Guo Xu long ago.

“Since he can cultivate it, so can I. Furthermore, my attainment in my physique isn’t something he can rival!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he made his decision without any hesitation. Placing the jade slip on his forehead, a boundless amount of information flowed into his mind. The complexity of the body-refining technique had exceeded his imagination.

Back in ancient times, there was a ferocious beast called the Azure Dragon that possessed a true dragon’s bloodline. It was so strong that even just breathing was lethal to people. The Azure Dragon Enneaform had eleven stages and its first two stages are its foundation.

In the first stage, Observe the Azure Dragon, he would have to manifest wind and lightning energies to temper his body. This would allow his physique to undergo a transformation. As for the second stage, he would have to refine the wind and lightning energies. When he finished the second stage, he would be able to use the secret technique of the Azure Dragon Enneaform, Monoform. At that time, a punch from him could gather both wind and lightning.

“Even with just one caudrons worth of strength, saintly music sounds out when throwing a punch…” muttered Lin Yun in deep thought. If he could reach that stage, even if his strength didn’t contain any lightning energy, the commotion alone would be shocking enough.

He had thirty cauldrons worth of strength, which meant that thirty lightning rumbles would overlap each other. He couldn’t imagine how terrifying that would be.

The key to the first two stages of the Azure Dragon Enneaform would be the wind and lightning energies. If one had some attainments in lightning attributes, it would be easier for their body to endure the lightning. For example, the cultivation technique that Guo Xu practiced could manifest lightning.

“I just need to give it a try.” Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed, allowing the jade slip to hover before him as he looked at the dragon coiling the jade slip. The purple dragon was filled with a trace of demonic origin and was filled with viciousness.

Vaguely, a terrifying dragon aura was attacking Lin Yun’s mind. If anyone had a weak mind, they would easily be overwhelmed. But fortunately, Lin Yun was a third grade spiritualist, so he could bear the burden easily.

Now that he looked at it, Guo Xu’s mindset was too simple. With his soul energy, there was no way he could bear the impact from the dragon aura, which meant that he wouldn’t be able to learn this.

Then, Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra for an entire cycle as the first stand of wind and lightning energies appeared in his body. In that split second, it felt like there was a volcano within his body as a domineering energy rampaged.

This made Lin Yun’s face change as he controlled a strand of dracophant energy to temper his body. Surprisingly, the first stage was easier than he had imagined. When the wind and lightning energies coursed through his body, he felt comfortable as he could sense his strength rising.

Interesting... It looks like the Dracophant Battle Physique isn’t much weaker. As Lin Yun thought about it, he became more bold in tempering his body with the wind and lightning energies. He circulated the body-refining technique within his body and every cell within his body underwent a transformation from the wind and lightning energies.

Time gradually passed and four hours passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun’s hair was fluttering in the wind as purple lightning crackled on the surface of his body. The lightning sounded as if it came from the nine heavens.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils glowed brightly as his mental energy surged. He suddenly stood up and threw a punch. Azure Dragon Enneaform—Monoform!

As thirty cauldrons’ worth of strength exploded in this small chamber, the fluctuation rippled out and caught Lin Yun by surprise. He threw up a mouthful of blood from his internal injuries. In that split second, he felt like the entire world was spinning and his six senses went blank.

He was only able to recover his senses after some time passed. Wiping the blood off his lips, Lin Yun smiled bitterly, “Is this the rumbling saintly music?”

From his punch, a purple fluctuation rippled out within the small chamber for a long time. When they clashed against each other, sparks flew around.

“The Azure Dragon Enneaform is truly terrifying,” said Lin Yun with disbelief in his eyes. The Azure Dragon Enneaform was still in the foundation stage, not to mention that he didn’t use all his strength. This made him wonder how powerful it would be after reaching Enneaform.

But he was sure that it wouldn’t be easy. After all, he relied on the Dracophant Battle Physique as the foundation to complete the first two stages. Lin Yun knew that the third stage was only the beginning. But right now, this was more than enough for Lin Yun. This transformation boosted Lin Yun’s confidence.

He could sense that the bottleneck to the greater Yang stage had loosen up and that he could cross over any time. Right now, he was confident that he could beat anyone that faced him. With the Azure Dragon Ennearform, the Seven Slaughtering Fist, and the sword in his hand, he would prove himself.

“Time to go!” Lin Yun left the chamber quickly. Four hours had passed, so the others must’ve passed the eighth trial. He didn’t know who he would run into, but he knew that he had to search the place first. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The eighth level had many tunnels like a maze. Occasionally, Lin Yun would find chambers, but Lin Yun merely took a glance at them. There were many treasures, but Lin Yun didn’t want to waste his time with the mediocre treasures.

Suddenly, Lin Yun sensed a weak fluctuation and he could sense excitement coming from his body.

A lightning attributed treasure? Lin Yun roughly had a guess and moved faster. It didn’t take long for an ancient hall to appear before Lin Yun’s vision. The center of the hall had a stone pillar and a droplet of blood hovered on top of the pillar that emitted a powerful aura. Under this aura, Lin Yun could even see visible fluctuations rippling out.

Looking at the droplet of blood that contained boundless energy, Lin Yun instantly recognized that it was the blood essence of an ancient demonic beast. Lin Yun had come across many chambers and halls along the way, but he only glanced at them. Only this droplet of blood could make Lin Yun’s come to a stop.

Since the blood was preserved since ancient times, it must have a huge origin. There was a high possibility that it might belong to a lightning attributed demonic beast. But judging from the excitement from his body, it might be related to the azure dragon.

Lin Yun’s heart began to beat wildly when he thought about it. If my speculation is true… Lin Yun’s gaze became heated in the next second when he looked at the droplet of blood. But as a cautious person, Lin Yun knew that he had to be composed right now.

As Lin Yun slowly stepped forward, he had caution on his face as he didn’t dare to be careless. When he approached the stone pillar, Lin Yun suddenly stretched out and reached for the blood essence.

But the moment he made his move, a weak aura suddenly surged over like a venomous viper trying to take a bite at him. It might seem insignificant, but Lin Yun had a feeling that it was dangerous.

Lin Yun instantly reacted by avoiding the attack relying on his instinct. But before he could gasp for his breath, three bolts of lightning suddenly shot towards him.

The three bolts of lightning released a powerful vibration and Lin Yun would have been heavily injured if he wasn’t strong enough. Lin Yun instantly realized that it was a formidable opponent, so he threw a punch out releasing his sword aura to destroy the bolts of lightning.

When his punch landed on the bolts of lightning, the lightning crumbled as Lin Yun landed at the corner of the hall. When he raised his head, he finally saw his assailant, Scarlet Python Whip Qin An.

Lin Yun’s face was indifferent as his killing aura surged in his pupils. Qin An’s attacks might seem casual, but they were vicious. If he was careless, the only outcome that awaited him was death.

“Get lost. I’m taking this blood essence,” said Qin An as he walked towards the stone pillar.
