Chapter 1407 - Who Offended Who?

When sunlight was shining in the morning, countless people in Azureblack City flocked towards the Sword Sect. After all, the news that saints would be taking in disciples had spread out, and there were even rumors that geniuses of the Ancient Saint Clans outside the Ancient Barren Domain would make their appearance.

Furthermore, the foundation of an Ancient Saint Clan was even stronger than some powerful sects. The reason why the Sword Sect could invite the descendants of the Ancient Saint Clans was that they were the strongest sect for swordsmen in the Ancient Barren Domain, and they were once a holy land.

If it was another powerful sect, no Ancient Saint Clan’s descendants would pay attention to them. Then again, the main attraction here was that the saints would be taking in disciples. If they could become the disciple of a saint and was a swordsman, to begin with, there was no reason for the geniuses of the Ancient Saint Clans to reject it.

After all, even Ancient Saint Clans didn’t have many saints, not to mention that their saints also might not have had the time to guide their descendants. They would only give some occasional pointers, which was inferior to the master-disciple relationship.

Moreover, not all saints were swordsmen. So not all saints could guide their swordsman descendants. This excited everyone to see which Ancient Saint Clan descendants would come.

After the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party left the inn, they spent an hour reaching the foot of the Sword Sect’s mountain. When they arrived, they noticed that this place was filled with people, and it was practically impossible for them to squeeze through the crowd.

“Oh my god, isn’t this a little too extravagant? Even the first stage didn’t have so many people.” Liu Qingyan was shocked.

But Gongsun Yan maintained his composure and said, “The Ancient Saint Clans are well-known, not to mention that saints will appear to pick disciples on this stage. Saints are existences that most people won’t be able to see in their lifetime; so, naturally, many people would gather here.”

Most of the people here were residents of Azureblack City, and Azureblack City had a deep connection with the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect wouldn’t stop them from watching, but they had strict guards stopping anyone from crossing the line. The Sword Sect did not intend to stop them and only upheld the regulation here, preventing them from causing any trouble.

“Come with me.” Old Liu appeared just when the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party had a headache trying to make their way in.

Old Liu led them through another passage, which was a lot quieter. This passage was meant for participants. The Sword Sect was differentiated into the inner and outer districts. The Sword Sect's seven peaks were within the inner district's scope. So they were covered in clouds, making it hard to see the peaks.

The outer district was much more casual because there weren’t many strict regulations. It was where the family and servants of the disciples lived.

The testing ground of the third stage was at the highest peak, located in the outer district. This massive peak was one of the forbidden regions in the outer district, and even disciples of the seven peaks would have difficulty getting close to it.

After the group walked towards the mountain through the passage, they saw that the peak was a massive ground with many towering buildings and constructs. At the center of it was a gigantic and vast stage.

The stage had several ancient stone pillars, and the ground was filled with thick blue stones. When they came to the summit, thousands of people had gathered there, and they were all geniuses who made it through the two stages.

The two tests that didn’t have any difficulty for Lin Yun eliminated 99% of the people. Over a hundred thousand people came to participate in the test, but only seven to eight thousand people were left.

But amongst these people, at least half of the people here would be eliminated. When Lin Yun examined the stage, he could see that the entire stage was covered with profound spiritual runes, which circulated with a familiar fluctuation.

This was similar to some teleportation arrays he saw in ancient ruins.

Could it be that this stage is a large-scale teleportation array? Lin Yun thought about it, but had no idea if it was connected to the third stage.

“The Xiahou Saint Clan is here!” Gongsun Yan nervously said beside Lin Yun.

The Xiahou Saint Clan and Bai Saint Clan came together, and the party leader naturally attracted everyone’s attention. It was Xiahou Yan, who caused an uproar half a month ago when he drew the saint sword on the first stage. This allowed him to be exempted from the second stage, and Lin Yun was often used to compare with Xiahou Yan.

But now, they weren’t in the spotlight because everyone was more curious about who would come from the Ancient Saint Clans.

Suddenly, a commotion broke out as Xiahou Yan led Xiahou Yun and Bai Zhanli to Lin Yun. This made the Sword Sect’s elder, who was responsible for this stage, lightly frown his brows. But he ultimately chose not to interfere.

The two were the center of everyone’s attention. Regardless of Xiahou Yan or Lin Yun, there was a high possibility of them to be taken in by saints as disciples. At that time, he also wouldn’t dare to offend them, even if he was an elder.As long as the matter didn’t blow up, he would close an eye to it.

“Are you kidding me? Xiahou Yan is heading towards Lin Yun!”

“They won’t fight here, right?”

“It’s unsure if the Sword Sect won’t interfere. After all, the Bodhi Seed is a precious treasure.”

“But since it belongs to Lin Yun now, it won’t be that easy to take it back. After all, don’t forget that Lin Yun is famous for his ‘good’ temper.”

“Hahaha!” Everyone already knew that Lin Yun had a ‘good’ temper. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“He’s really here.” Gongsun Yan became nervous since he had once fought with Xiahou Yan. More accurately, he was taught a lesson by Xiahou Yan, and he couldn’t retaliate at all. After Xiahou Yan reached the Elysium Core Realm, Gongsun Yan no longer had the qualification to fight him, and it had become a huge trauma for him. Even though he has received the Sword Emperor’s inheritance and reached the Elysium Core Realm, he still couldn’t help feeling anxious when facing Xiahou Yan.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was calm and composed. It didn’t take long for Xiahou Yan to stand before him, and he could sense a sharp aura blowing at him. Even Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan were under tremendous pressure, and this made their faces become grave.

“Big Brother, he’s Lin Yun! He’s the one who snatched the Bodhi Seed from me!” Xiahou Yun yelled when he saw Lin Yun with flames blazing in his pupils.

But it was a pity that Xiahou Yan didn’t respond the way he wanted. Xiahou Yan briefly examined Lin Yun before he asked, “The Bodhi Seed is a treasure of my Xiahou Saint Clan. But my younger brother lost, and it’s a fact. I only want to ask if there’s any possibility that…”

“Nope.” Lin Yun interrupted before Xiahou Yan could finish. This instantly left Xiahou Yun and Bai Zhanli dumbfounded when Lin Yun interrupted Xiahou Yan before he could finish. Not only the two of them, but even everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was shocked, especially Gongsun Yan. Xiahou Yan was already polite, but Lin Yun didn’t give him any face and interrupted him.

Seeing that Xiahou Yan seemed to be suppressing his anger, Lin Yun decided to explain after a brief pondering, “I won the Bodhi Seed fairly, and I didn’t force your younger brother to bet with me, nor did I use any tricks. Your younger brother lost. And it was your younger brother who forced me to participate in the bet and even wanted to stop me from joining the Sword Sect, but he’s too weak to accomplish it.”

Xiahou Yan suppressed his anger and asked, “I’m asking if there’s any possibility that…”

“I already said nope.” Lin Yun looked at Xiahou Yan and continued, “There’s no possibility, regardless if you want to win it back or exchange other treasures with me. You can talk about other matters, but I suggest you give up on the Bodhi Seed.”

“Flower Burial, you really have a good temper.” Xiahou Yan suddenly smiled. “I’ve witnessed it today.”

A cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils as he coldly replied, “So what? Did you stand out as the big brother to apologize on your younger brother’s behalf when your younger brother tried to trick me into taking the bet and stopping me from joining the Sword Sect? He claims I stole the Bodhi Seed, but you’re not saying anything about it? What’s the matter? Are you trying to portray me as the bad guy here?”

Bai Zhanli, Xiahou Yun, and everyone else on the stage was dumbfounded when they heard Lin Yun’s words. They all knew that Lin Yun had a ‘good’ temper, but they never imagined that he wouldn’t give any face to Xiahou Yan. Who was Xiahou Yan? He was publicly known to be the strongest swordsman of the generation in the Ancient Barren Domain, possessing the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart. So his talent in the path of a swordsman was unrivaled.

His rank on the Elysium Core Ranking also reached three thousand. If you only look at those on the ranking under twenty-five, Xiahou Yan could be ranked in the top five-hundredths, which was a ranking that enveloped the entire Eastern Desolation.

But no one thought that it would be so intense between them, and even Xiahou Yan never thought that Lin Yun would have such a strong stance, not giving him any chance to speak. He initially thought if he could get the Bodhi Seed back through a fair exchange or find an opportunity to bet with Lin Yun. After all, he was confident there wasn’t a person around who wouldn’t give him face in the Ancient Barren Domain.

But it was unfortunate that he ran into Lin Yun today, who didn’t listen to him at all.

“Big brother, this fellow is a barbarian. You should just teach him a lesson.” Xiahou Yun nearly threw up some blood because he didn’t think that Lin Yun would still be so arrogant after facing his big brother.

“I hope you won’t regret it. Let us wait and see then. No one has dared to speak to me in this manner before.” Xiahou Yan said after looking at Lin Yun for a long time before he left after he was done.

“Lin Yun, you don’t look like yourself today…” Gongsun Yan said nervously because this was the first time he had seen Lin Yun so rude.

“I thought he was here to apologize,” replied Lin Yun. It was Xiahou Yun who was at fault for wanting to embarrass him in public and even tried to prevent him from joining the Sword Sect.

But Gongsun Yan was speechless when he heard that—wanting the strongest swordsman amongst the younger generation in the Ancient Barren Domain to apologize to him.

“But you’ve offended him.” Gongsun Yan said in a worried tone.

But Lin Yun merely looked at Gongsun Yan, making Gongsun Yan feel a chill down his spine before he smiled, “Looks like I really have a good temper.”

Who offended who? Wasn’t it Xiahou Yan who offended him?

Right then, an azure vulture broke through the clouds, and ten-odd people were standing on the back of the vulture. They had an extraordinary temperament that instantly captivated everyone’s attention.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a purple flower embroidered on their clothes. They were from the Radiant Snow Clan. They have arrived!
