Chapter 1118 - Empress' Three Great Hobbies

Above the palace, the quasi-empyreans who ran out didn’t even have time to catch their breath. They could hear footsteps coming from behind, which made them confused. They weren’t sure if Flower Burial failed because of how fast the battle ended.

The Empyrean Realm was divided into three stages, the Star, Galaxy, and Astral Stages. Although Huang Yong was only in the pinnacle Star Stage, even Galaxy Stage experts would have a hard time dealing with him in his palace.

All of a sudden, everyone wore ugly expressions because they realized that they just betrayed Huang Yong. If Huang Yong managed to kill Flower Burial, he would be chasing all of them down. The thought of this prospect made everyone fall to their knees.

But right at this moment, a breeze blew past. When the quasi-empyreans opened their eyes, they couldn’t speak. Then, Flower Burial’s silver figure disappeared into the night.

Suddenly, they recovered from their shock. If Flower Burial was here, did that mean that Huang Yong was dead? This was a little too quick, and it had practically just been a breath’s time.

“This Flower Burial truly deserves his reputation.”

“And he’s really fast too!”

“We can’t stay here anymore. Let’s leave quickly!” The quasi-empyreans stood up with pale faces as they ran for their lives. Soon after, the dancers also left as they blankly stared at the sky.

Four hours later on a nearby island, Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple, and Lil’ Red were seated around a bonfire.

“Lady Luo was right.” Lin Yun removed the mask on his face and looked at the jade flute in his hand blankly, “I can really push my ability to the limit using the flute.”

The stronger the intent in the flute music, the stronger the sword intent would be. If he had relied on his sword to fight Huang Yong, he wouldn’t win as easily. Then again, using the flute wasn’t invincible either because Lin Yun had also been placed in several dangerous situations over the past month.

If his opponent could break through the intent in his flute music, then Lin Yun would instantly suffer a backlash and fall into a weakened state. Additionally, he had to watch out if his opponent’s cultivation was too strong or if they had any special treasures.

“Hmph. It’s clearly something I taught you, so why are you thanking that woman instead of me? Who told you the flaws in the array underground? Otherwise, would it be so easy to kill Huang Yong?” Lil’ Purple snorted unhappily.

“Of course, I have to thank our Lil’ Purple here,” smiled Lin Yun.

“I’m angry now, and I don’t want to talk to you right now,” replied Lil’ Purple.

“Not even this?” Lin Yun said, playing with the box in his hand.

“It’s mine!” Lil’ Purple became anxious and pounced over like a little kitten. But Lin Yun merely smiled and pulled the box back, causing Lil’ Purple to miss and fall onto the ground.

When Lil’ Purple got back on her feet, Lin Yun gave the box and winked, “Yours.”

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple took the box and her eyes began to shine when she opened it. Inside the box was an Indigoflame Gold Lotus with a trace of blood at the lotus heart. The trace of blood had a sacred aura that made the entire Indigoflame Goldlotus look sacred.

It was stronger than the one Lin Yun had gotten in the past, especially since the trace of blood had a special feeling to it. It probably belonged to a divine beast and could have made Huang Yong reach the Galaxy Stage.

But there was no way the Indigoflame Gold Lotus could be compared to his Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. Closing the box once more, Lil’ Purple replied, “Not bad. I used to eat ten celestial herbs every day for meals. The Indigoflame Gold Lotus barely fits my diet. At least the trace of blood increases the medicinal effect of this herb even more.

Lil’ Purple hugged the box tightly as if Lin Yun would snatch it away from her. Lin Yun smiled before he disappeared into the night, “Stay here and don’t go anywhere.”

When he returned, he came back with many dead demonic beasts. When Lil’ Red saw this, its eyes lit up because it knew that Lin Yun was going to roast meat. Lil’ Red had tasted the food roasted by Lin Yun in the past, and knew how delicious it was. So Lil’ Red had already started to drool when looking at the demonic beasts.

“Lil’ Purple, go find some wood.” Lin Yun took out a dagger and began to skin the demonic beasts proficiently.

When Lil’ Purple heard that, she pouted and said, “Lil’ Red, go and find some wood.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lil’ Red went obediently to find wood and came back shortly after with some dried tree branches. But Lin Yun raised his head and looked at Lil’ Purple before he said, “You go too.”

“Hmph, there’s no way this empress will go and pick up some branches.”

“Then you can’t have any of this later.”

“Hmph, this empress never eats meat. I’m a vegan.” Lil’ Purple glanced at Lin Yun with disdain.

“You better remember that.” Lin Yun ignored her and continued to deal with the meat. It didn’t take long for him to finish removing the most tender part of the demonic beasts before taking out condiments from his interspatial pouches. Then, he started to roast the meat.

When the fat oozed out of the meat, he started adding his spices. Just like that, the roasted meat emitted a fragrant aroma that made Lil’ Purple salivate and caused her stomach to grumble.

Lin Yun brought out the Iris Sacred Flame, using the cold attribute in the flame so that the meat wouldn’t be charred on the outside. It didn’t take long for the meat to become perfectly cooked.

Seeing that Lin Yun was using the Iris Sacred Flame to roast meat, Lil’ Purple couldn’t help feeling furious. However, she continued to salivate at the fragrance.

Lin Yun sliced a big piece of meat and handed it to Lil’ Red. When he was done, he sliced another piece before handing it to Lil’ Purple, “Here, for you!”

“Hmph, I’m a vegan!” Lil’ Purple said, turning her head away. But her stomach betrayed her as peeked at the meat Lin Yun was offering.

“Go on. Your stomach is already grumbling.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Since you insist, I’ll give you some face. I’ll take a bite. But my dignity as a member of the Divine Phoenix Clan won’t allow me to take another. So you can be proud that I’m giving you this honor!” Then, Lil’ Purple took a bite.

Since the meat was roasted with the Iris Sacred Flame, it wasn’t too hot on the surface. So the surface was crispy and chewy, not to mention that every single inch of the meat had perfectly fused with the spices.

After Lil’ Purple took the first bite, she continued to eat with her eyes squinted and it didn’t take long for her mouth to be covered with oil. She then looked at Lin Yun and chuckled in excitement, “Lin Yun, it’s really good! In the future, you’re only allowed to roast meat for this empress and no one else!”

At this moment, she gave up her dignity as a member of the Divine Phoenix Clan away. But Lin Yun merely smiled and wasn’t bothered by it. After all, the empress has three major hobbies, boasting, slapping faces, and acting narcissistic.

However, she didn’t slap other people’s faces, she would slap her own. To Lin Yun, it was as if Lil’ Purple wasn’t comfortable until she slapped her face with her words. She was adorable and anyone could tell that she would grow into a beauty in the future, but she was still foolish.

When Lil’ Purple was done eating, she still didn’t feel satisfied. So she had Lin Yun take out a pot to cook the Indigoflame Gold Lotus and turned it into fish soup. Just like that, Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple, and Lil’ Red ate the Indigoflame Gold Lotus.

If Huang Yong knew how they wasted the Indigoflame Gold Lotus that he had spent so many years nurturing, he would be angered to death. When Lil’ Purple was done, she was filled with excitement and carried Lil’ Red away.

But Lin Yun grabbed onto her and wiped the oil from her lips. When this happened, Lil’ Purple was unhappy and she even waved her hands around.

Lin Yun quickly finished and then took out the scroll with names. He only had one more name left. It was the strongest demonic cultivator who was in the greater mastery Galaxy Stage. Half a year ago, this person had fought with Ye Ziling. Although he was defeated, he ultimately managed to escape.

Half a year ago, Ye Ziling’s sky sword intent was only at lesser mastery. Although the sky sword intent meant that she should be invincible among those in the same cultivation, she still allowed this demonic cultivator to escape. Now that half a year had passed, the demonic cultivator was much stronger.
