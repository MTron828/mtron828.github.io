Chapter 2143: Make Trouble! (1)

On the True Dragon Path’s throne, Cao Yang sat for a long time as he looked around. As he breathed, he could enjoy the benefits of the true dragon aura. The scenery here was beautiful, which Cao Yang enjoyed a lot. He had closed his eyes with a smile rising on his lips.

But he couldn’t smile anymore the moment Mu Qianjue tore apart the True Dragon Path’s barrier and descended onto the True Dragon Path with a strong stance. “Get lost!”

When the black and white wings flapped behind him, this placed all the cultivators under tremendous pressure with fear reflected in their eyes. That was the same for Ye Ziling, who was on the Dragon’s Claw. She raised her head and looked at Mu Qianjue, who gave off a powerful saint aura as the black and white wings flapped, looking like a deity.

Cao Yang’s face changed because he hadn’t sat on the throne long enough, and yet someone came, demanding him to get lost. So what if Mu Qianjue was the champion of a Heavenly Path? So what if he had a pair of black and white wings behind him? He believed that he could put up a fight with Mu Qianjue with the Vajra Golden Physique.

As a rage of flames began to brew within Cao Yang’s eyes, he soared to the sky and made a move when Mu Qianjue arrived. He cupped his fists together, and he bowed with a smile, “I’m honored to welcome the champion of a Heavenly Path!”

Before Mu Qianjue could make a move, Cao Yang quickly gave up his seat with a respectful and humble attitude. This naturally surprised Mu Qianjue, but he didn’t think much about it as his gaze fell onto the throne on the Dragon’s Head with a hint of disappointment in his eyes.

The True Dragon Path was pathetic in the eyes of geniuses like them. The champion of the True Dragon Path wasn’t a glory but a humiliation to a genius of his calibre. Mu Qianjue sighed, “I’m afraid no one would be willing to become the True Dragon Path’s champion if they had a choice.”

It was a pity that he didn’t have much choice. After leaving the Indigo Dragon Path, he would either have to go to one of the other Divine Dragon Paths or the Azure Dragon Path, and neither of them was a good choice. Only the True Dragon Path’s champion was easy to obtain, and he could only hope that he could make a comeback during the final battle.

Those outside the Dragon Mountains were also shocked. After all, no one expected the champion of a Heavenly Path to choose the True Dragon Path. This choice had shattered the myth.

“You seem unwilling?” Mu Qianjue looked at Cao Yang with a hint of ridicule in his eyes. Before Cao Yang could reply, he reached out and grabbed the latter’s wrist.

Can Yang’s wrist was instantly crushed with his face distorted from the pain. But even under the pain, he still squeezed out a smile, “Young Master Qianjue must be joking. How will I dare to have other thoughts?”

Mu Qianjue said coldly, “No need to pretend. I saw fighting spirits and rage in your eyes earlier. In your eyes, I’m just someone who lost, right?”

It would be a lie if Mu Qianjue wasn’t affected after being chased out of the Indigo Dragon Path, and his expression became colder.

Cao Yang let out a scream because Mu Qianjue was slowly torturing him, but there was nothing he could do to resist. He screamed, “Arghh, it hurts…”

“Get lost. Normally, I wouldn’t even take a look at a piece of trash like you.” Mu Qianjue’s gaze was ruthless as he twisted Cao Yang’s arm backward. There was no way Cao Yang’s Vajra Golden Physique could be compared to Mu Qianjue’s Great Divine Phaseless Art.

Cao Yang was sweating profusely from the pain, but he didn’t dare to say a word and could only watch as Mu Qianjue slowly walked towards the throne on the Dragon’s Head. Everyone else on the True Dragon Path was also frightened because their strength was pitiful in the face of a Heavenly Path’s champion.

The Blue Dragon Record’s arrival was a competition among geniuses, but only a few could shine brightly on such a grand event. Everyone else would only become stepping stones, and this made them feel depressed and helpless as they looked at Mu Qianjue.

“Who allowed you to set foot on the True Dragon Path?” Just when Mu Qianjue was about to sit on the throne, a cold voice resounded as a sword ray shattered the barrier of the True Dragon Path. It was Lin Yun who came over from the Indigo Dragon Path, returning to the True Dragon Path.

As the barrier shattered under the sword ray, it was like a blade that flew towards Mu Qianjue. The latter reached out to shatter the sword ray and took a few steps back. When he raised his head, he saw a young swordsman standing before the throne looking at him coldly.

“Ye Qingtian!” Mu Qianjue was shocked with his lips slightly opened. But in the next second, Mu Qianjue flew into rage with a rage of flames blazing in his eyes. The black and white wings behind him shone brightly, and he roared, “You’re pushing it!”

The entire world became black and white. Mu Qianjue couldn’t hold himself back any longer. If he leaves again for the other Divine Dragon Paths, there‘s no doubt that he would become a laughingstock to everyone. As he flapped the wings behind him, a violent gale exploded that looked like ink splashing around. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Yun was calm as he released the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. A silver sword ray swept out that added another color in the black and white world.

Mu Qianjue executed the Phaseless Star Shattering Palm with a greater dao, approaching Lin Yun. Whenever Mu Qianjue pushed his palm out, terrifying phenomenon beasts flew out, and those beasts were black and white.

This was a world made up entirely of ink. As the white and black radiance circulated, it felt as though the entire world was within his control, aside from Lin Yun, the stars in the sky, the bright moon that hung high above, the Divine Firefly Sword, and the Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

.

As Lin Yun swung his sword, he didn’t move a step before the throne as he shattered the incoming beasts with his sword ray. Whenever he thrusted his sword, colors would slowly return to the black and white world. This was the color that belonged to the Flower Burial Sword.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun resolved all the incoming attacks, and he raised his sword towards the sky.

This made blood drip from Mu Qianjue’s lips as he was sent flying away. He only managed to stabilize himself after taking three steps back. Colors have returned to the world as Lin Yun’s sword ray looked eternal before the throne with his eyes shining brightly.

“So what if I’m pushing it?” Lin Yun asked coldly, and he rebuked, “Just because you’re the champion of a Heavenly Path? Only you’re allowed to bully others, and others can’t bully you? As the champion of a Heavenly Path, you have chosen to fall and come to the True Dragon Path. Don’t you know any shame?”

Lin Yun spoke the heart of everyone on the True Dragon Path.

“Well said!” Cao Yang echoed after he fixed his arm. But because he yelled too greatly, this made him grimace from the pain with the corner of his lips twitching.

“I advise you to talk less.” Ye Ziling rolled her eyes as she used her ice aura to reconnect Cao Yang’s broken arm and seal the wound.

Cao Yang grinned, “I’m fine. It doesn’t hurt, and it’s satisfying to see Ye Qingtian give that bastard a beating!”

The other geniuses on the True Dragon Path also felt satisfying from this scene. After all, Mu Qianjue berated the True Dragon Path the moment he arrived and even put on an aloof expression, disgusting everyone. In the end, Mu Qianjue even wanted the throne on the True Dragon Path.
