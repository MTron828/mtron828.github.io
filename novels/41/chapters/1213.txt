Chapter 1214 - Guest from the Heaven

Lil’ Purple was drowning with sins? Luo Hua wanted to kill Lil’ Purple? There was naturally no way he would allow that, not to mention that Luo Hua didn’t have a reason to do so. But the current atmosphere was terrible.

But this was the first time he sensed such a domineering aura from Luo Hua, not to mention Luo Hua’s demand wasn’t too much. After all, she only asked him not to stand in front of Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun understood Luo Hua well. She wouldn’t make a demand casually, but the moment she did, it would be hard for anyone to change her mind. After a brief pondering, Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple and said, “She’s only a child.”

“She’s not,” replied Luo Hua.

Hearing that made Lin Yun briefly stunned. Truth be told, Lin Yun always wondered why Lil’ Purple was sealed by the Iris Sword Saint for 100,000 years. If Lil’ Purple didn’t do anything wrong, no one would imprison her for 100,000 years without reason. After all, being imprisoned for so long was a worse punishment than death for many people. So perhaps Luo Hua was right, and maybe only she could see the sins of Lil’ Purple.

Lil’ Purple hid behind Lin Yun nervously, which made him sigh, “She’s really only a child.”

Luo Hua fell silent for a long time before she smiled, “Indeed, but she’s a little too unreasonably pretty. Don’t have any thoughts about her or I won’t let you go.”

Seeing Luo Hua choose to take a step back, Lin Yun felt relieved and smiled, “You’re not injured anywhere, right?”

“They can’t hurt me,” said Luo Hua with confidence filled in his tone. But she pondered briefly before she looked at Lil’ Purple, “The Ice Phoenix Bracelet must be made by you, right? I like it.”

“It’s good that you like it. It’s just one bracelet,” said Lil’ Purple unhappily. Clearly, she was still holding a grudge against Luo Hua, but she didn’t reveal it openly either because she was afraid of Luo Hua.

“Someone’s coming.” Lil’ Purple raised her head to look at the sky because she disappeared into the sword box.

Seeing this scene, Luo Hua finally knew why she failed to discover Lil’ Purple’s existence. So it turns out that Lil’ Purple had been hiding in the sword box. Right at this moment, two figures descended from the sky, Bai Ting and the Huang Clan’s patriarch.

Huang Clan’s patriarch was calm as though he had already expected the disaster tonight. He glanced at Lin Yun and Luo Hua before he said, “You better leave now. I can no longer protect you.”

“We’ve been trouble to you.” Lin Yun pondered briefly before he took out a Nirvana Pellet, “Please accept this as a gift of gratitude from me.”

He only had two Nirvana Pellets left, and now he only had one more. The Huang Clan’s patriarch was surprised because he didn’t expect that the arrogant Lin Yun from the Sword Assembly would have such a meticulous side to him. Accepting the Nirvana Pellet, he smiled, “Take care of yourself well. If you don’t really have a choice, then give the Lightning Shadow Sword away. According to what I know, Jian Jingtian has already given up on this sword a long time ago. I have no idea why he’s asking you to retrieve it after so many years.”

The Huang Clan’s patriarch basically confirmed Lin Yun’s speculations. Clearly, the old geezer wanted to use the three arrays to temper him. Nodding his head, Lin Yun turned to look at Bai Ting, “Elder, is there any news from the sect master? He should be coming to pick us up…”

Bai Ting’s lips twitched when he heard that and said, “The sect master said that we’re on our own. As for the Lightning Shadow Sword, you can give it to whoever you want. You can even keep it if you’re not afraid of death. He has to stay in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and he can’t come for us.”

If it was in the past, Lin Yun would have been speechless. But now that it was just a matter of time for him to grasp the divine firmament sword intent, he knew what the old geezer was planning. Then again, he wasn’t happy.

“Looks like you guys don’t know about Jian Jingtian’s story.” The Huang Clan’s patriarch suddenly smiled, “There’s no way he can leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Then again, not many people know about this even though 18 years have passed.”

“What is it?” Lin Yun and Bai Ting were both curious when they heard that.

With lament on his face, the Huang Clan’s patriarch sighed, “Back then, he was the most outstanding disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and also a monstrous genius of the Sword Sect. He was ranked number one on the empyrean, elysian, and dragon pulse ranking. He swept through all geniuses in his generation and became known as the hope for the Sword Sect to return back to being a sacred ground. But he committed a grave mistake and was expelled from the sect by the Radiant Sword Saint. When the Sword Sect expelled him, the Sword Sect also took back his surname and he was punished to never leave the Profound Azure Prefecture in his lifetime.”

Lin Yun was greatly shocked when he heard that the old geezer was ranked first on the three rankings. It was simply unfathomable. He didn’t think that the old geezer was so strong in the past. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“T-The sect master is a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? Why haven’t I heard of it before? How is this possible?!” Bai Ting was even more shocked as his attention was on the Radiant Sword Saint rather than ranked first on the three rankings.

“Is this Radiant Sword Saint strong?” Lin Yun muttered while he held onto his chin.

“He is one of the three sword saints in the Eastern Desolation,” explained Bai Ting.

“After Jian Jingtian, the sword saint never accepted another disciple. Anyway, you better leave now because my place can’t handle more of this trouble. Young lad, remember that your life is more important than a sword, and Jian Jingtian has already given up on this sword,” sighed the Huang Clan’s patriarch.

Lin Yun wore a complicated expression when he heard that. Jian Jingtian might have let go of this sword a long time ago, but he didn’t. After all, this was a thousand-rune saint sword forged by the Mo Clan, and he could easily kill a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert with just ten saint runes.

When the three of them left the Huang Clan’s manor, they sensed several auras on them belonging to Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

“Lin Yun is out!”

“He’s alive?”

“I thought he already died based on the commotion in the Huang Clan. This fellow is really fortunate.” Their appearance immediately caused an uproar among the geniuses. Evidently, the chaos in the Huang Clan had attracted everyone’s expectation and they had predicted that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to leave the Azure Rock County. Gongsun Yan, Gong Haoran, Zhao Yan, and the rest from the Sword Assembly were among them.

They were also curious if Lin Yun could return to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect alive. After all, the Lightning Shadow Sword had attracted all the experts from the older generation. Who knew how many old monsters were hidden in the city.

“The temptation of the Lightning Shadow Sword is really huge,” said Luo Hua as she swept her gaze around calmly.

“Young Master Luo, don’t you have any arrangements?” Bai Ting said uneasily while he comforted the Profound Astral Bird.

“Let’s leave the city first,” said Luo Hua while she got on the Profound Astral Bird with Lin Yun behind her. Just like that, the group of three flew out of the city on the Profound Astral Bird.

“Follow them!” Countless figures in the city also flew into the sky and chased behind the Profound Astral Bird.

The Profound Astral Bird’s speed was fast, and it left the city very quickly. Seeing that none of the Dragon Pulse Realm experts made a move, Bai Ting felt relieved. It seemed like the Dragon Pulse Realm experts didn’t want to act against a junior and become a joke.

But in the next second, several powerful auras swept out, causing the Profound Astral Bird who wanted to break through the first layer of heaven to panic. This also made Bai Ting’s face change because the pursuers ultimately came.

Following this was an immense pressure that forced the Profound Astral Bird to the ground. When they looked around, they could see several figures enveloped in black mist to cover their appearances.

“Hand the Lightning Shadow Sword over!” A hoarse voice sounded out. Clearly, it was masked so no one could recognize the individual.

“There are so many people here, so who should I hand it to? Why don’t you come and take it yourself?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with ridicule. He had the Firmament Battle Cloth, so he wasn’t afraid of those in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Leave the sword behind and then you can go,” said another person.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, he could see that this person was also enveloped in black mist. When he looked again, he saw a total of nine people surrounding them.

There was no doubt that they were Dragon Pulse Realm experts who showed up after confirming that Luo Hua didn’t have any Dragon Pulse Realm experts protecting her. So this was why they didn’t bother to conceal their strength.

“Get lost. You have no authority to speak here!”

“You’re only an ant in our eyes. Don’t bother trying to make us fight among ourselves. Leave the sword behind and we’ll deal with it ourselves.”

“You should be thankful that we spared your life. Otherwise, even that young lass beside you will die to our rage.”

“Don’t think of fighting against us. An expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm isn’t someone you can offend. You wouldn’t even know how you died if we wanted you dead!” The nine figures stood proudly in the sky, completely disregarding Lin Yun’s existence.

This made Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with killing intent. Just when he wanted to summon the Firmament Battle Cloth to smack these people to ddeath, Luo Hua suddenly held onto his wrist and said, “He’s here.”

“Don’t bother hiding. If you were really from an ancient saint clan, how could you not have any Dragon Pulse Realm experts around you? Feng Xuanzi might be afraid of you, but we aren’t. There’s nothing you can do!” The nine figures sneered, thinking that Luo Hua was just trying to put up a strong front.

But right at this moment, heaven broke as a crimson figure descended from the sky enveloped with a demonic aura.

“A demonic cultivator.” Lin Yun was surprised. Could this person really be the backup Luo Hua talked about?
