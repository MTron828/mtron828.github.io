Chapter 1233 - Divine Dragon Baptism

Lin Yun’s sword aura had reached an unprecedented height as the sword cocoon in his forehead shined. It instantly dissolved the Blood Demonic Dragon and pushed Xiahou Jue to the ground.

Aseries of exclamations resounded while everyone was surprised by Lin Yun’s strength after he drew his sword.

Everyone from the Crimson Moon Elysium had disbelief on their faces when they looked at this scene, especially the Grand Elder Chen Mu. He also didn’t expect that Xiahou Jue would lose in this manner.

As Xiahou Jue threw out a mouthful of blood, he gritted his teeth, unwilling to admit defeat. At the same time, strands of crimson aura seeped out of his body to form another crimson moon.

But right at this moment, a sword ray flew out from Lin Yun’s hand and the Flower Burial Sword touched Xiahou Jue’s forehead. It was like a bucket of water that was poured over Xiahou Jue’s head. He froze at Lin Yun’s warning because he would really die if he made another move.

“Admit defeat. Don’t force me.” Lin Yun said coldly. He had to admit that Xiahou Jue’s determination to win was rare, but he wouldn’t hesitate if Xiahou Jue still wanted to put up a fight.

Xiahou Jue glared at Lin Yun for a long time before he said, “You won!”

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and his face loosened up, “You’re not bad yourself to be able to force me this far.”

The battle gave Lin Yun a better idea of Gongsun Yan and the others in the top 1,000 on the Empyrean Ranking. It was no wonder why he caused a huge uproar after defeating everyone at the Sword Assembly. In terms of their attainments in martial techniques, they weren’t comparable to Lin Yun. However, their cultivation was a lot stronger. If he hadn’t reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, he might not have beaten all of them.

“Hmph, I don’t need your pity,” said Xiahou Jue coldly. “A win is a win. The outcome is the same regardless if I’m defeated by one sword or a thousand swords.”

Looking at Xiahou Jue’s departing figure, Lin Yun’s gaze began to flicker because Xiahou Jue was right. But this also meant that he wouldn’t be able to receive the Divine Dragon Baptism and would run into trouble to become a holy son.

After all, Xiahou Jue couldn’t afford to lose to become a holy son because defeat would only mean death. In the future, he didn’t think that he would see Xiahou Jue again.

“Lin Yun wins the final battle!” When the elders of the Profound Azure Prefecture made the announcement, cheers resounded from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party.

“Does this mean that Junior Brother Yun is the strongest in the Profound Azure Prefecture?”

“Xiahou Jue is ranked in the top 3,000 on the Empyrean Ranking. This means that Junior Brother Yun is at least in the top 3,000 too. He might even be able to make it into the top 1,000!”

“It’s really shocking that he can compete with the top-tier geniuses of the Eastern Desolation when he just arrived in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect half a year ago.” The gazes of Jiang Lichen and the rest were filled with admiration because they had a feeling that Lin Yun’s name would be famous in the future.

Not long after, the prefectural lord came over with a party to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and looked at Ye Ziling, “According to the rules, the Sword Saint Mountain will still belong to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Furthermore, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can also draw out a new territory, which includes the territory of the Thousand Crane Pavilion and Azure Thunder Monastery…”

This ranking battle not only involved each sect’s ranking but would also shuffle the territories of the Profound Azure Prefecture. Since the Thousand Crane Pavilion and Azure Thunder Monastery weren’t in the top three, they might have to relocate their sects.

But these were the predetermined rules, and there was nothing the forces behind them could do. In truth, the same went for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. If they couldn’t make it into the top three, they could lose their sect along with the Sword Saint Mountain.

“We’ll decide again after I return to the sect. May I ask when we will go to the Divine Dragon Pavilion?” Ye Ziling asked.

“Do you have to be so anxious? Give me five names and you can all go through the baptism tomorrow,” smiled the prefectural lord.

“Just the five of us. Lin Yun, what do you think?” Ye Ziling turned to look at Lin Yun. Since Lin Yun was the one who won the battle, he was naturally the decision-maker.

“I have no objections,” said Lin Yun. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With that, the grand event had come to an end. It would be a long time before anyone forgot about Lin Yun and Xiahou Jue’s battle. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s appearance would definitely spread out not only in the Profound Azure Prefecture but also in the entire Ancient Barren Domain.

Then again, Lin Yun had no interest in fame and he didn’t want the Profound Sky Sect to know where he was.

Facing such a colossal force like the Profound Sky Sect, he could only rely on Feng Jue or the protection of the Sword Sect. Then again, there was no use for him to think about it now as he was more interested in the Divine Dragon Baptism.

The day after, Ye Ziling led Lin Yun and the rest to the array set up by the prefectural lord. After they went through the teleportation array, an azure dragon pagoda appeared before them.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the dragon pagoda a hundred feet away gave him a feeling similar to the Azure Rock County’s Hidden Sword Pavilion. It was filled with an ancient aura from a long time ago.

“This is the Divine Dragon Pagoda. Similar pagodas can be found throughout Kunlun Realm, and they’re responsible for suppressing the Divine Dragon Empire’s fortune,” said Ye Ziling.

Hearing that, the prefectural lord smiled, “The main tower is called the Divine Dragon Sun-Moon Pagoda, which is a divine artifact. The baptism is a refinement of the divine dragon aura filtered by the Divine Dragon Pagoda. But don’t absorb too much. Five is the limit in the Empyrean Realm, and it might damage your foundation and physique if you go over that.”

“Is it that serious?” Jiang Lichen asked.

“Yeah. There was once an Elysium Core Realm expert who refined nine strands of aura and exploded to death. We didn’t even have time to save him,” warned the prefectural lord.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes when he heard that.

“If you guys are prepared for it, I’ll open the seal now and release the divine dragon aura this pagoda has been accumulating,” said the prefectural lord.

Hearing that, the five nodded their heads. When the prefectural lord took out the seal given to him by the Divine Dragon Empire, it hovered in the air and a gigantic seal appeared that stamped the pagoda.

In the next moment, a dragon roar echoed within the surroundings, and strands of a golden-yellow aura came from the pagoda. When Lin Yun took in a deep breath, the Azure Dragon Saint Art activated without his control and began to devour the aura.

Lin Yun was shocked because this was the same feeling as when the Azure Dragon Saint Art devoured the runes back then. Could it be that the divine dragon aura could also benefit the Azure Dragon Saint Art? But Lin Yun soon suppressed his thoughts and waited.

“Begin!” The prefectural lord said when the golden-yellow aura filled the surroundings.

“Remember what I said. Don’t try to devour too much or it’ll do more harm than good,” warned the prefectural lord once more.

Ye Ziling and the rest nodded their heads before they sat down and circulated their sword sutras to devour the golden-yellow aura in the surroundings. As they devoured and refined the divine dragon aura, a vague dragon outline formed around them.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to begin the refinement, so he observed his surroundings. Then, he discovered that the dragon around Ye Ziling was the clearest as she was forming a dragon’s claw. The others couldn’t even compare, only being able to make a blurred outline.

This made Lin Yun fall into deep thought. If Ye Ziling went on, the dragon outline might really manifest a genuine divine dragon. Apparently, if one successfully refined a strand of the divine dragon aura, they could manifest the divine dragon image.

So it seemed like Ye Ziling could at least refine five strands of divine dragon aura while it would be hard for others to even refine three. Lin Yun became curious as to how many strands he could refine.
