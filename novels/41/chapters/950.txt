Chapter 951 - Strong Stance

Lin Yun’s fight with Skyhawk Realm ended quickly, but the news of his arrival soon spread out in the city which caused a huge uproar because no one expected that Lin Yun would dare to show himself.

After all, the leader of Bloodbone Realm, Liu Mu, had reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and he declared that he would make Lin Yun pay the price a hundredfold if Lin Yun dared to show himself. For higher realms’ geniuses, there was no risk in their first and second tribulations.

But it would start to become dangerous from their third tribulation. The fourth tribulation was the same as putting their lives on the line. This also meant that those who could get through their fourth tribulation was proof of their strength. Aside from that, everyone else gathered in the shrine were all top-tiered geniuses that were a lot stronger than the Skyhawk Realm.

So he wasn’t sure that they could resist their temptation when they saw him. Regardless of the Glorysun Spirit, greater dao artifacts, or his advanced fortune martial techniques all had great temptation. In many people’s view, Lin Yun shouldn’t have shown up and hid until the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm appeared. At that time, everyone’s attention would be drawn away from him.

But no one had expected that Lin Yun would directly show up here and stood out when he saw his friends being bullied by the Skyhawk Realm.

“This Lin Yun is really strong. I heard that Skyhawk Realm’s leader went down on his knees with just a single exchange.”

“That’s terrifying. Someone like him is like a bright comet shining in the sky.”

“But he seems to be heading towards the shrine. Just what is he thinking?”

“Who knows. Even if he can face Liu Mu, the other higher realms’ geniuses also won’t let him go.” There were many people gathered outside the shrine as they watched Lin Yun enter. All of them wanted to follow Lin Yun and see what would happen inside. But none of them dared to take a step forth.

Since they weren’t strong enough, it was the same as courting death to be so close to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Just when they were all feeling anxious, Highcloud Realm’s party actually entered under Mu Yan’s lead which left many people shocked.

These people took the risk to enter clearly because they wanted to save Lin Yun in the crucial moment. But it was no different from courting death for them to enter with their current strength.

“The Highcloud Realm is really courageous.”

“Let’s go and take a look. Why are you guys thinking so much? Even the Highcloud Realm dares to enter, so why do we have to be afraid?”

“Let’s go!” With Highcloud Realm taking the lead, everyone mustered their courage and started pouring into the shrine.

Lin Yun had already gone far into the shrine. The shrine had many constructs emitting an ancient aura, looking majestic and grand. But this place was extremely quiet.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This instantly allowed Lin Yun to understand what was going on. After all, those without sufficient strength wouldn’t dare to enter the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm as there were many top-tiered geniuses gathered there that not even Bloodbone Realm could be considered a powerful force among them. If the higher realms’ leaders didn’t have enough strength, they could only watch from outside.

Suddenly, the Glorysun Spirit started trembling in his interspatial pouch. This made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts that it must be resonating with the other astral spirits.

At the centre of the shrine, there was a three thousand meters altar located at the centre of it. Around the altar was empty which looked like a plaza. But there were many higher realms gathered here and all of their leaders emitted a powerful aura. At the same time, the leaders who could be here were all famous figures in the Azure Dragon Region.

In front of the altar, there were five people standing as they emitted a powerful aura. There were many experts here, but they were nothing compared to the five of them. They were the owners of the Glorygold, Glorywood, Glorywater, Gloryfire, and Gloryearth Spirits. Not only were the five astral spirits equivalent to keys, one could also refine the benefit in it.

At the right of the altar, there was a youth standing there as he was donned in black clothes. His clothes had striking crimson patterns embroidered. He was Bloodbone Realm’s leader, Liu Mu. He was wearing a smile and chatting with Blazeyang Realm’s leader, Mo Yan.

His strength might not be the strongest around here, but his aura in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm alone could intimidate many people. Suddenly, Liu Mu’s face changed with his killing intent bursting out uncontrollably. “That brat really came!”

When his killing intent spread out, the surrounding discussions became quiet. Everyone could sense a thing or two when they sensed the killing intent coming from Liu Mu. But when they heard it from Liu Mu himself, the various higher realms’ leaders were briefly stunned before they wore a playful smile.

After all, they all knew that Lin Yun had many treasures on him. Let’s not mention the Glorysun Spirit, but his sword was enough to tempt much higher realm’s geniuses. If Liu Mu couldn’t deal with Lin Yun, they naturally wouldn’t mind ‘helping’ him out. Although there were rumours that Lin Yun had stolen Mo Yan’s monarch beast core, none of them had placed Lin Yun in their eyes because they weren’t from ordinary higher realms. All of their higher realms’ foundations had exceeded many people’s expectations.

“Liu Mu, my Demonsand Realm don’t mind helping you take Lin Yun’s head.” A higher realm’s leader smiled coldly while looking at Liu Mu.

“You can’t put it that way. Not only did Lin Yun offend the Bloodbone Realm, but he had disregarded all our higher realms. Just what he said about anyone who could compete in the Heavenly Path alone was annoying,” said another higher realm’s genius.

Everyone from the Bloodbone Realm’s faces became nasty when they heard that. Didn’t they know that they had an irreconcilable grudge with Lin Yun? If they couldn’t take Lin Yun down by themselves, then their Bloodbone Realm might as well leave the Heavenly Path.

Just when several of them were about to flare up, Liu Mu swept his glance and sneered, “It doesn't matter. You guys can do as you wish if you guys are confident about your strength. Just leave me his head.”

“Haha. Everyone naturally has to kill someone from the lower realm as arrogant as him. Humiliating the Bloodbone Realm is the same as slapping our faces. So how can we let him stay arrogant?”

“That’s right. A piece of trash from the lower realm wants to compare himself to us? He must be dreaming!”

“Only needing one sword to kill? He really knows how to boast.” The other higher realms’ geniuses became excited when they heard what Liu Mu said, making it seem as if they would all charge forth if Lin Yun dared to show himself.

“You guys can give it a try to see how many swords I need to kill.” Right at this moment, a burst of laughter sounded out which made the plaza silent. When they turned their heads over, they saw a figure wearing a hood and carrying a sword box on his back walking in slowly. When he removed his hood and revealed his face, he instantly drew everyone’s attention.

“Lin Yun!” Mo Yan began to tremble beside Liu Mu with his face turning dark. At the same time, the owner of the five astral spirits also turned around at the same time and looked at Lin Yun with interest.

“What arrogance! I want to see how capable you are. Come and kill me with one sword if you dare!” A figure stood out with greed flashing in the depth of his pupils as he charged towards Lin Yun. The aura he was giving off was in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. He might not be comparable to some higher realm’s leaders here, his aura was a lot stronger than Kong Xuan.

When he charged over, he clenched his fist and threw his punch out with immense pressure crashing down. Facing this sudden attack, Lin Yun didn’t even bat an eye and started circulating both his sword sutras. When his origin energy poured into the hood in his hand, his hood started glowing with azure and purple radiance.

When the radiance reached a limit, Lin Yun threw his hood out. When his hood reappeared, it had clashed with the cultivator who charged over and was sent flying out. When that person fell onto the ground, he rolled on the ground several times with his face distorted with pain.

Many higher realms’ geniuses had a sharp light flashing in their pupils while some were startled. After all, that was a third soul Heavenly Soul Realm and was defeated by Lin Yun in just one exchange?

“Don’t bother sending a piece of trash like him. I don’t even need to draw my sword to take his life.” Lin Yun then turned his attention to the Bloodbone Realm and fixed on Liu Mu before he roared, “I’m here to resolve personal matters. Those who are uninvolved better not interfere or don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
