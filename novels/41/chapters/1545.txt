Chapter 1546 - Sword Basking In The Blood Of Saint (2)

The two ancestors of the Qin Saint Clan were named Azureflame Saint Lord and Indigothunder Saint Lord. One was proficient in the dao of flame, and the other was proficient in the dao of thunder. They didn’t hesitate to soar into the sky and make a move.

The Azureflame Saint Lord pushed his palm forth, with torrential sacred flames converging to form a gigantic palm that reached for Mu Xuankong’s head. This palm was terrifying, with fine cracks spreading out in the space, and the length of each crack reached a few thousand miles.

Flames fell from the cracks like rain. If a Samsara Edict Realm expert dared to walk over at this moment, it would be easier for them to comprehend the dao of flame. But they would be even more afraid because Samsara Edict Realm experts would suffocate if they dared to step forth.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Just the flames that splashed on the ground were enough to claim their lives. After all, a saint’s power wasn’t something anyone could imagine.

The Indigothunder Saint Lord also didn’t hesitate to attack as he drew his blade. Countless laws of thunder poured into the blade. This was a saint’s power, since only saints could use laws. Law was profound, and it wasn’t something that Samsara Edict Realm experts could comprehend.

The three saints combined their forces to deal with Mu Xuankong, who became a saint three hundred years ago.

“If the Radiant Sword Saint doesn’t come today, we’ll kill this person. There’s no need to spare his life, but I need the help of two ancestors!” Qin Xiao let out a breath after he received the help of two saint lords, and he instantly got his confidence back.

Even if he had brought out a Glory Saint Artifact, it was still taxing for him to face Mu Xuankong’s sword.

“Dissolving Heaven!” Mu Xuankong swung his sword to sever the gigantic flaming palm. When he swung his sword, it unleashed a terrifying light that could melt heaven. The blazing sword ray gave off the feeling that it could dissolve everything in the world.

It looked like the sky had suddenly disappeared, making everyone feel afraid. When Mu Xuankong’s sword collided with the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s blade, the sword ray easily destroyed the thunder law on the latter’s blade.

As the Indigothunder Saint Lord let out a ferocious roar, his constellation appeared behind him to support the thunder law in his blade. The outcome of their clash was instantly determined as the lightning gathered by Indigothunder Saint Lord shattered. When Mu Xuankong’s sword knocked the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s blade away, his sword fell onto the latter, sending the latter flying and throwing out a mouthful of blood.

Mu Xuankong’s sword ray easily destroyed the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s saint armor and left behind a terrifying wound on the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s body. The wound made the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s saint blood rain down like a heavy downpour.

All the Samsara Edict Realm and Saint Realm experts who were watching the battle from afar were shocked. They were completely dumbfounded and could feel a terrifying chill coursing down their spines.

Just like that, a saint that has lived for two thousand years was sent flying away by Mu Xuankong with his blood raining down like a heavy downpour.

“You’ve only cultivated for three hundred years… so how can your grasp in the law be so terrifying?!” The Indigothunder Saint Lord stared at Mu Xuankong. After all, he was from the same era as the Radiant Sword Saint and had witnessed when the Radiant Sword Saint’s name shook the entire Eastern Desolation.

Today, he could see the Radiant Sword Saint’s silhouette on Mu Xuankong. When he raised his head and exchanged a glance with the Azureflame Saint Lord, they both had a wisp of fear flashing across their pupils.

Mu Xuankong was donned in a crimson robe and the Scarlet Saint Sword in his hand vibrated incessantly. After the sword had basked in the blood of a saint, it became even sharper.

Meanwhile, Qin Xiao’s face was hideous. Just a moment ago, he was confident, thinking he could easily subdue Mu Xuankong with the help of two ancestors. But they never expected that Mu Xuankong would resolve this crisis so quickly.

“I’m here to kill Qin Xiao today. If the two of you insist on standing in my way, I won’t mind teaching you two how the word ‘death’ is written!” Mu Xuankong said coldly as he looked at the two saint lords with their brows raised.

When the Indigothunder Saint Lord and Azureflame Saint Lord heard Mu Xuankong’s words, their hearts couldn’t help sinking. Mu Xuankong was too similar to the Radiant Sword Saint, regardless of whether it was their temperament or words.

“Ancestors, don’t be scared by his words. He’s just a junior who became a saint three hundred years ago. He left the Sword Sect after three hundred years and wanted to use me to sharpen his sword. I don’t believe that he has that capability. I’m confident that he won’t be able to use that sword again!” Qin Xiao’s face sank as he pushed the Glory Saint Artifact in his hand to the limit, and three thousand stars appeared above his head.

The starlight enveloped Qin Xiao’s figure, and his radiance was even more dazzling than the sun behind Mu Xuankong.

“The Glory Saint Artifact! It looks like Qin Xiao isn’t simple, since he’s able to unleash the full power of the Glory Sword Artifact in such a short time!”

“The Glory Saint Artifact is too powerful in the hands of a saint.” All the Samsara Edict Realm experts were shocked.

“Divine Radiance!” Qin Xiao roared, allowing the radiance in his spear to shatter the thirty-six layers of heaven. The power of the Glory Saint Artifact then turned into countless streaks of light, emitting a destructive power as he charged in Mu Xuankong’s direction.

“Mu Xuankong, do you think you’re the second Radiant Sword Saint? You’re really unlucky to come to my Nether Divinity Clan alone. Today, I’ll show you the true power of a Glory Saint Artifact. Even if the Radiant Sword Saint arrives, I’ll destroy your reputation!” The thirty-six layers of heaven cracked as the light streaked across the horizon.

The seven thousand streaks of light converged and emitted a terrifying power. The power was so terrifying that it could even tear space apart. As boundless spatial fragments raged like a violent tornado, even saints were terrified when they saw this scene.

But Mu Xuankong hovered in the air as streaks of light fell from the sky and formed into an invisible domain. Sparks flew when the spatial fragments collided with the domain, and the spatial fragments couldn’t even touch the corner of Mu Xuankong’s clothes.

“The Sword Domain!”

“Qin Xiao, back down! Quickly!” The Azureflame Saint Lord and Indigothunder Saint Lord exclaimed with their faces changed.

As a sword mark bloomed on Mu Xuankong’s forehead, space was torn apart as though it was going to throw out a blazing sun.

When Qin Xiao felt uncertain, a sword ray broke through the thirty-six layers of heaven and descended, eradicating all the saint radiance and laws around Qin Xiao.

“Slice!” A voice echoed beside his ears as Mu Xuankong’s sword pierced through his heart, destroying his saint origin. This instantly made Qin Xiao panic, and he yelled, “No! No! No!”

When another sword ray flashed, Qin Xiao’s head flew away. After Mu Xuankong sheathed his sword, he grabbed onto Qin Xiao’s head and glanced at the two saint lords. His gaze terrified the two saint lords and they stepped a few thousand miles back. They were both intimidated by Mu Xuankong’s guts and strength.

Just like that, the Qin Saint Clan’s patriarch was slain, and the two ancestors didn’t even dare to utter a word. This made the entire Nether Divinity Clan fall into silence. The spectators were shocked, and no one dared to say a word.

At this moment, Mu Xuankong had become taboo. He stayed in the Sword Sect after he became a saint three hundred years ago. When he left the Sword Sect for the first time after three thousand years, his sword had basked in the blood of a saint.
