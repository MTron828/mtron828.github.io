Chapter 1224 - Obsession

When Lin Yun wielded the Lightning Shadow Sword, it brought Lin Yun’s quasi-divine firmament sword intent to the height of divine firmament sword intent. Lin Yun didn’t go easy on them and released his sword intent entirely. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Ziling tried her best to maintain her feet, but she had doubt on her face when she saw the sword in Lin Yun’s hand. She had never seen Lin Yun using that sword before, but recalling how Lin Yun was missing for the past few days, she immediately connected his disappearance with that sword.

But when she saw the two ancient words written on the sword hilt, her face suddenly changed. She instantly figured out where Lin Yun went the past few days and why the sword intent around him was so dense along with the desolation in his pupils, “That’s the Lightning Shadow Sword! Lin Yun, you went to the Sword Assembly and made it through the three challenges?!”

Ye Ziling bit her lips. Despite the reluctance in her pupils, she couldn’t conceal the respect in her eyes. At this moment, Lin Yun wasn’t any weaker than Flower Burial in her mind. Did Lin Yun really want to make her owe him for the rest of her life? Cursing out inwardly, Ye Ziling became somewhat perplexed.

“The Lightning Shadow Sword?” Jiang Lichen, Liu Qingyan, and Feng Zhang were all shocked. They naturally knew about that sword since it was a precious sword forged by the Mo Clan. Now it made sense why Lin Yun could release such a terrifying pressure just by wielding a sword. Most importantly, it meant that Lin Yun had successfully made it through the three challenges.

“Why don’t you talk after you stand up? The name of this sword has nothing to do with you all.” A light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils as he drew the sword out by half an inch. In the next second, everyone threw up a mouthful of blood and went flying. Lin Yun had only drawn the sword out by half an inch, but his sword aura had reached a terrifying height. They couldn’t believe how strong he was after he was enveloped in pure lightning.

When everyone fell onto the ground, they laid on the ground unable to move. Lin Yun was simply too terrifying. The Suspend King Palace’s monarch aura was nothing compared to Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Lin Yun, you’re too anxious and it has lost the tempering effect. They can’t even stand,” said Lil’ Purple with her brows locked together. At the same time, she felt that Lin Yun was really terrifying when he was ruthless.

“I know what I’m doing,” said Lin Yun. Although his sword aura had gotten stronger, all he did was merely send them flying out a few hundred meters. At the same time, he retracted his quasi-divine firmament sword intent to within ten feet of radius.

“Hmph. I don’t believe it,” said Lil’ Purple. But the moment she finished, Wang Yuruo was the first to stand up. This had truly shocked Lil’ Purple because Wang Yuruo was the first person to stand when Ye Ziling couldn’t.

Lin Yun was also surprised by the fact that Wang Yuruo was the first to stand. Shortly after, Ye Ziling released her sky sword intent and slowly stood up while wiping the blood on her lips.

“Sky sword intent is combining sword intent with the sky. It is also the greatest difference between spiritual and sky sword intent…” Lin Yun’s voice sounded out in the ears of Liu Qingyan and the rest once more as he shared his comprehension of spiritual and sky sword intent once more.

Although he already shared his insights, it was more effective this time around. Boundless insight poured into everyone as they realized what Lin Yun was sharing.

Thirty minutes later, a powerful sword intent soared into the sky that came from Feng Zhang. He had finally reached the sky sword intent. This surprised Lil’ Purple even more as she exclaimed, “Whoa, this is unbelievable.”

Lin Yun didn’t react as he continued speaking, “There’s nothing to be surprised about. Their talent isn’t weak, and they’re all geniuses of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. If that old geezer was a little more serious about teaching them, they would have achieved the sky sword intent a long time ago.”

Lil’ Purple agreed with Lin Yun. But the old geezer was a heaven-defying genius who was the champion of the three rankings. He didn’t even teach his daughter, so how could he put his attention on those like Feng Zhang?

While Ye Ziling and the rest were being tortured by Lin Yun’s sword intent, the Suspend King Palace was also busy. The disciples were seated together with the elder with worry on their faces.

“Tianhao, do you have any confidence in beating Xiahou Jue?” The elder asked.

Chu Tianhao pondered briefly before he said, “I’m 40% confident I can beat him. If I resort to my trump card, maybe 50%. I already knew about Xiahou Jue’s existence, but I didn’t think that he was a genius secretly nurtured by the Crimson Moon Elysium. If I’ve guessed it correctly, he must’ve reached the quasi-Elysium Core Realm.”

Hearing that, everyone took a deep breath. Their faces changed because Xiahou Jue was capable of killing lesser Elysium Core Realm experts.

“But nothing is certain in an actual fight. The difference between me and him isn’t that great,” said Chu Tianhao. Shortly after, he smiled, “Furthermore, I might also not run into him. If we miss each other and obtain a win each, our Suspend King Palace still has a high chance.”

Hearing Chu Tianhao’s words, everyone’s expression became a lot better. But right at this moment, someone asked, “Is there a plan to deal with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

“Why do we need to plan against them? Only Lin Yun is worth our attention. Hahaha!” Qin Yang laughed. Everyone else also shared the same thoughts because there was nothing special about the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect aside from Lin Yun.

At most, maybe Ye Ziling could also be an opponent to them. However, the other three were no different than garbage, especially their chief disciple Jiang Lichen who lost to a nameless disciple of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

“We don’t have to worry about the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. If any of us run into Lin Yun, we just have to give up,” said Chu Tianhao.

In the blink of an eye, one night passed. When the first light of dawn shined down on the Profound Azure City, the audience was already waiting in the plaza.

Back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s campsite, Ye Ziling and the rest were weakly lying on the ground. They didn’t suffer any fatal injuries and their pupils were shining brightly. To Feng Zhang and the rest, it was one of the longest nights of their lives. But they had also undergone a drastic transformation in just one night with a great improvement in their strength.

Through one night, they excavated all of the potential within their body. So the effects might not be that great if Lin Yun did it again.

Lin Yun took out a Nirvana Pellet and divided it into six before giving everyone a part of it. Their injuries might seem serious, but none of the wounds were fatal. Splitting the Nirvana Pellet into six was more than enough for them to recover from their injuries. Although this was Lin Yun’s last Nirvana Pellet, he didn’t feel any heartache when he gave it up.

“The Nirvana Pellet!” Ye Ziling was briefly stunned before she figured out why Lin Yun had one. It probably came from Flower Burial as a gift of gratitude for giving back his jade flute. But Lin Yun gave it to her, which meant that Lin Yun had paid a huge price for her obsession.

But Flower Burial saved her life when she was in danger. That was also the night that her calm heart for twenty years throbbed for the first time. She could never forget how he blew her flute to kill her opponent. At the same time, she wondered if she was really right in asking Lin Yun for help.

Seeing that she was distracted, Lin Yun said, “Brother Flower Burial told me that he can’t join this battle. He would be here if he was able to participate.”

Ye Ziling was startled awake by those words and merely smiled. What was she thinking about? Both Lin Yun and Flower Burial were beyond her reach.

Basking in the light of dawn, everyone took the Nirvana Pellet and refined it. As Lin Yun retreated to the side, his eyes flashed with exhaustion because he exhausted himself last night. However, it was worth it for him because everyone grew tremendously.

He would ultimately leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. But even if he left, he now knew that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect wouldn’t collapse.

A long time later, everyone opened their brightly shining eyes. Looking at them, Lin Yun smiled, “Let’s go and sweep through the Suspend King Palace!”
