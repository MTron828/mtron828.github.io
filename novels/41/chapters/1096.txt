Chapter 1097 - Who Dares To Envy?

The attack from the dracoape surprised everyone. After all, Lil’ Red didn’t even use a weapon. If Lil’ Red had taken out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, then Guo Ming would probably be reduced to nothing.

Those who had belittled Lin Yun earlier were dumbfounded and could no longer speak. Feng Zhang was especially quiet as he was basically slapped in the face.

“Senior Brother Feng, that fat cat is pretty strong…” Those who were standing beside Feng Zhang were dumbfounded.

“Hmph!” Feng Zhang’s face was ugly as he glared at the disciple who spoke. He wasn’t blind. How could he not tell that Guo Ming was instantly knocked unconscious. Immediately, the disciple who spoke up smiled awkwardly because they knew they shouldn’t have said anything.

“Why is his pet so terrifying?” Many core disciples felt great pressure when they looked at Lin Yun. Now, their eyes were flashing with envy because they found out that Lil’ Red had a dracoape bloodline. Such a pet was rare even in Ancient Barren Domain.

“Lin Yun, you’re shameless!”

“You’re taking it too far! Junior Brother Guo clearly wanted to test you out, so why did you send your pet out to fight?”

“Are you even a man? You don’t dare to fight personally?”

“Your pet is too ruthless. Senior Brother Guo clearly wanted a friendly spar with you. How shameless!” When everyone recovered from their shock, they immediately looked at Lin Yun with indignance.

But they were terrified when they were glared at by Lil’ Red, who had turned into its dracoape form. This made Lin Yun grin, “Sorry about that. This pet of mine isn’t too intelligent. Don’t speak so loudly or I’m afraid that I won’t be able to stop it from killing you guys.”

Seeing the innocent smile on Lin Yun’s face, the crowd felt hopeless. Right at this moment, someone mustered his courage and spoke out, “You’re too much of a bully to rely on your pet to fight Senior Brother Guo.”

“Sorry about that. But didn’t the sect master tell you guys clearly? I’m here to bully all of you!” Lin Yun smiled. Everyone in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was arrogant and prideful because they were swordsmen. However, they had never seen someone as arrogant as Lin Yun.

Naturally, the crowd was enraged and wanted to trample on Lin Yun. Right at this moment, four people stood up and looked at Lin Yun. All four of them were wearing the uniform of inner disciples and their cultivation was in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Standing together, their combined boundless sword intent felt like the size of a mountain range.

“Zhang Xun!” “Cao Ziyan!” “Wang Peng!” “Liu Feng!”

The four announced their names, which caused many people to exclaim. When it came to the inner disciples, they were in the top ten since they all reached the spiritual sword intent over a year ago. On top of that, they even reached greater mastery six months ago.

They were quickly rising in fame in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect due to their strength, and everyone knew that they would be promoted to core disciples within a year.

When the elders saw this scene, they sighed in relief. Any one of the four could easily suppress Lin Yun. It was guaranteed that they would prevent the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect from turning into a laughingstock.

“If you think that we’re taking advantage of you based on our cultivation, you can pick one of us to fight with you. We’re inner disciples, and we believe that we have the qualification to fight you. Don’t you agree?” All four of them had gazes as sharp as swords when they spoke.

“Barely, but the four of you better come at once… or else you will lose terribly…” Lin Yun smiled.

In the next second, the four of them unleashed their spiritual sword intent with rage flashing across their eyes. Instantly, the atmosphere became intense. None of the four could be considered a pushover, and anyone who offended them would be destroyed.

“There’s a limit to how arrogant you can be!” Cao Ziyan made the first move and disappeared. Shortly after, a radiating sword ray flashed, which showed how unbelievably fast Cao Ziyan was.

But when Lin Yun stretched his hand out, the sword ray on Cao Ziyan suddenly disappeared. He pushed his palm out and sent Cao Ziyan flying, without giving the latter a chance to get close. Landing on the ground, Cao Ziyan let out a groan and threw up a mouthful of blood.

No one could believe that Cao Ziyan was defeated by Lin Yun with only one palm. Even if Cao Ziyan wasn’t serious, Lin Yun was a little too unbelievably strong. The remaining three exclaimed as they looked at Lin Yun with unconcealable shock.

“I already told you all, I’m here to bully you. Since the four of you aren’t happy about that, I’ll just have to beat you all up!” Lin Yun smiled and pounced on the four of them. He unleashed an immense pressure that made the four inner disciples feel like they were suffocating.

The four inner disciples drew their swords without any hesitation and clashed with Lin Yun. Even if the four of them had given it their all, they could barely put up a fight before Lin Yun.

“Moon Aroma! Cloud Dispelling Sun!” Lin Yun threw two punches out that unleashed a moon and sun. When he threw his punches out, the four inner disciples spit up blood. Then, their swords fell to the ground.

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect isn’t that impressive after all.” Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground and retreated. His performance was making the disciples mad. Earlier, they were able to invalidate Lin Yun’s win because he relied on Lil’ Red’s power. However, it seemed like Lin Yun really had legitimate strength. He basically proved them wrong and slapped their faces.

Although Lin Yun was arrogant, he had a reason to be. He completely crushed the four rising stars without much effort. Of course, it was nothing to him since he was able to face ten Realm Sons at once.

He wasn’t joking when he said that he was here to bully everyone. Since they wanted to mess with him, he was going to crush them.

“You think there’s no one in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” A cold snort sounded out as a slender figure walked out of the crowd. He was donned in black clothes that made him look like a sharp sword.

“Senior Brother Wu is here!” A commotion broke out because Wu Kun, who was known for his obsession with swords, was stepping up. His cultivation had long reached the pinnacle of the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm and he had several Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans. He was an aloof person who paid attention to nothing else aside from the sword. To date, he was recognized as the strongest among the inner disciples. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

His appearance also made fear flash across the eyes of many core disciples because they knew that he was a ruthless person.

Even Ye Zilign was shocked by Wu Kun. Wu Kun could have become a core disciple long ago, but he had sworn that he wouldn’t step into the Empyrean Realm if he didn’t have the sky sword intent. So his spiritual sword intent had long reached complete mastery and was even more terrifying than many core disciples.

Wu Kun merely waved his sword, which flew over and stabbed the ground. Many people’s eyes lit up because Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword to defeat the four inner disciples. So Wu Kun also wasn’t going to use his sword.

“You’re strong, but you’re nothing in my eyes!” Wu Kun said before he took a step forward. Dense sword rays flew out of his body as his sword aura began to rise violently with every step he took. After seven steps, he began to look like a sword ray himself.

Is this spiritual sword intent at complete mastery? Many people were shocked by the radiance Wu Kun was giving off.

“You still have the chance to admit defeat. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that you’ll make it out alive. You have no idea how powerful my sword intent is,” said Wu Kun proudly. Then again, he had the qualification to be proud with his spiritual sword intent at complete mastery while under the age of twenty.

“Why don’t you take a step forward then?” Lin Yun folded his arms together and looked at Wu Kun with a playful smile. His arrogance made everyone sneer. They couldn’t wait for him to get hit by Wu Kun.

“I apologize in advance!” But just when Wu Kun was about to raise his head, he realized in fear that he couldn’t move a single muscle. It felt as though his sword intent had bumped into a wall. He moved his eyes to look at Lin Yun who was wearing a playful smile.

Lin Yun’s gaze was suffocating. Although Wu Kun had already pushed his sword intent to the limit, he still couldn’t take another step forward. Looking at Lin Yun again, fear began to loom over his heart.

The other disciples also noticed something unusual about this situation. After all, Wu Kun only needed to take another step forward to unleash all of his sword aura. Why was he standing still?

Even Ye Ziling was also surprised as she tried to get a better look at what was going on. Feng Zhang’s face also changed as he began to wonder why Wu Kun couldn’t do a thing to Lin Yun. The stalemate made many disciples in the Flying Cloud Palace nervous and confused at the same time.

“What’s wrong? Why don’t you take a few steps towards me?” Lin Yun smiled and took a step forward. Instantly, the sword ray coming from Wu Kun began to dim down. Wu Kun quickly retreated as Lin Yun silently took another step forward.

Just like that, Lin Yun continued to walk forward while Wu Kun walked backwards. It was a confusing scene for the crowd. After Lin Yun took seven steps out, the sword ray from Wu Kun was so dim that it basically had no more light.

Unable to bear with the pressure any longer, Wu Kun threw up a mouthful of blood and fell to his knees.

“What was that you were saying? I’m nothing in your eyes?” Lin Yun waved his hand as his boundless sword aura turned into a violent gale that sent Wu Kun flying.

When Wu Kun fell to the ground, no one dared to look down on Lin Yun anymore. Lin Yun’s gaze was filled with arrogance as he said, “I’ll make everyone angry if I don’t have any strength to receive what’s mine. So I want to know, which one of you is feeling jealous? Come fight me if you dare!”
