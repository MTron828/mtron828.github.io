Chapter 1736 – You Talk A Lot!

Hua Hongyu’s words were filled with gunpowder. Everyone would only be slightly shocked if they heard it from someone else because this was a public provocation. But when it’s coming from Hua Hongyu, it was only more shocking.

At times, the competition between women would only be more intense and cruel than men, and Hua Hongyu was clearly jealous. After all, Yue Weiwei had stumped many people with her beauty when she went on the stage earlier, and Hua Hongyu was known as the most beautiful lady in Heavenly Domain City. Even if she wasn’t bothered by it, it was unavoidable for her to be unhappy, not to mention that she really cared about that reputation.

Since Yue Weiwei made her appearance, she could sense that the attention on her was decreasing. Some people even said that Yue Weiwei was the most beautiful woman in Heavenly Domain City, and this naturally made Hua Hongyu furious. Most importantly, even someone as prideful as her had to admit that she was inferior to Yue Weiwei in beauty. This was why she stood out when she saw that Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were about to leave the stage.

Everyone in the surroundings fell into silence and held their breath. This was because no one expected this play after a breathtaking battle in music dao. After they were briefly stunned, they all wore playful gazes. Everyone knew what Hua Hongyu was trying to do, so they were curious about how the Profound Fairy would react.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s gaze turned cold when he looked at the Hua Hongyu. But just when he was going to respond, Yue Weiwei held onto his hand and smiled, “Big Sister is right. I’m sorry for disappointing Big Sister, then.”

This made Hua Hongyu’s face change because Yue Weiwei’s attitude made her feel contempt, and she couldn’t vent her pent up resentment. With a cold gaze, she continued, “Since you know shame, back out if you still have any face, then.”

Her words made Yue Weiwei furrow her brows. Just when she was going to refute, a cold voice resounded beside her, “What has it got to do with you, then? Who do you think you are? The most beautiful woman in Heavenly Domain City? You’re really shameless.”

When everyone’s gazes turned to where the voice came from, they saw that it was from Lin Yun, who stood beside Yue Weiwei, and his gaze was indifferent. Lin Yun already wanted to respond when she initially questioned Yue Weiwei. But since she didn’t want any face, Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t give her any.

Everyone was shocked when they looked at Lin Yun. The faces of those from the Myriad Flowers Hall were ugly because Hua Hongyu represented them right now. Mocking her in public was the same as slapping the Myriad Flowers Hall’s face. Not to mention that they couldn’t find an issue in what Hua Hongyu said. After all, the Profound Fairy was promoted to the next round when she did nothing on the stage.

“After all, the Profound Fairy got promoted when she didn’t even make a move on the stage.” A Myriad Flowers Hall’s disciple said.

“Don’t make yourself look like a clown. The pavilion master has yet to say a word, so who do you think your Myriad Flowers Hall is?” Lin Yun said with a chill flashing across his pupils.

When Hua Hongyu saw Lin Yun’s furocity, she smiled. This was what she wanted to see, them losing their composure. She smiled and pitifully said, “You’re right. I’m not qualified to say anything when the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master hasn't. I am just being outspoken, and I apologize to Young Master Lin Xiao. I have no intentions of targeting you.”

“Scram!” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to play with Hua Hongyu. He looked at the Myriad Flowers Hall party and said, “If the Myriad Flowers Hall isn't happy, I welcome all challenges. Martial dao or music dao, I welcome any challenge. Weiwei, let’s go.”

When he said that, he ignored the unsightly expression of the Myriad Flowers Hall and left with Yue Weiwei. This made Yue Weiwei briefly stunned before she smiled. Her Big Brother Lin was overbearing, but she liked it.

The surroundings fell into silence, with everyone looking at Lin Yun in disbelief. They realized that they couldn’t look at Lin Yun normally because this fellow was too arrogant.

When Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei returned, Yan Tianchen sent a helpless look at Lin Yun because the latter was as arrogant as always. He didn’t know how to keep a low profile at all.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi looked at Lin Yun but weren’t angry. Their pupils were filled with envy and admiration when they looked at Lin Yun, and they realized that there was a reason why Lin Yun could catch the Profound Fairy’s attention.

No one in the same generation probably had the same courage as him, protecting Yue Weiwei in public and even daring to challenge the entire Myriad Flowers Hall. There was no one as arrogant as him.

After all, even those who could do it would have reservations, but Lin Yun couldn't be bothered. Since they wanted to bully Yue Weiwei, there was no need for Lin Yun to give them any face and just publically slap them.

The Nirvana Stage continued after this incident. Lin Yun noticed a man as he stood beside Yue Weiwei, and this person was a holy land genius. He was Qin Hao of the Heavenly Flame Sect. He was dashing, and his cultivation reached the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. His popularity wasn’t at all inferior, even when he was compared to Li Yuxi.

The dragon origin in his body was massive, like a blazing sun. Lin Yun took note of this person because he felt hostility coming from Qin Hao when he rebuked Hua Hongyu earlier.

When the holy land’s geniuses began to appear, the battles on the Nirvana Stage became increasingly intense. Everyone could clearly sense the terror of the holy land’s geniuses, and the phenomenons from their music emitted tremendous pressure. They could feel a chill run down their spines when they saw how the holy land geniuses swept through the stage. This was because they were too terrifying.

Even when the pavilion master said that no one was allowed to use their martial cultivation, everyone could sense how strong the holy land geniuses were when they infused their dragon origin with their music.

Lin Yun paid particular attention to the holy land geniuses. This was because they weren’t merely geniuses in music dao but also martial dao. At the very least, many were on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Simply put, they were the same as him. Their main focus was on martial dao. But the difference was that these people relied on brute force. Even if they grasped the Great Saint Tone, their attainment in music dao couldn’t be compared to those actual music dao geniuses.

This filled the music dao geniuses with resentment, but they could only bear it because they didn’t violate the rules. Not to mention they were holy land geniuses. So who dared to question them?

When dusk came, the first round of the Nirvana Banquet ended, and only three hundred-odd people of the ten thousand made it to the next round. In many rounds, the stage was cleared before the judge could even announce the results, especially the ones that had the holy land geniuses. They were arrogant, and didn’t give anyone else a face.

When the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master stood up, everyone quickly got on their feet. The pavilion master smiled, “Let’s call it a day here. Tonight, my son, Yingtian, will host a banquet to receive everyone here. There will be Dragon Clan wines for you guys to enjoy the night. We will continue tomorrow!”

Everyone’s eyes lit up with excitement when they heard about the Dragon Clan wine. This was because Dragon Clan wines were rare, and yet they could enjoy them today.

When night came, the young master of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, Jiang Yingtian, was already waiting there. He raised his cup and said, “The first round of the Nirvana Banquet has ended here today, and all of you are music dao geniuses in the Kunlun Realm. In the future, there might be someone who has grasped the Divine Dragon Tone amongst you. So don’t forget about this banquet today. I give everyone a toast here.”

Lin Yun also drank with everyone, and the Dragon Clan wine was as delicious as always. But he was already used to it, so he didn’t feel that it was anything special.

What Jiang Yingtian said was right. Everyone here was a genius in music dao, and there would definitely be someone who would grasp the Divine Dragon Tone amongst them when the golden age arrived. This was probably the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s objective, to befriend that person early on so they would benefit in the future.

“The Dragon Clan’s wine is truly extraordinary. The foundation of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion is really shocking.” The Flying Snow Pavilion’s Bai Yunfei smiled as he gulped down a cup of wine.

“Indeed. The scenery in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion is beautiful, and this is an eye-opening experience. It’s not an exaggeration to call it a celestial realm.”

The banquet was bustling, and many people shared their memorable encounters and recent events in the Kunlun Realm. Many people mentioned the Blue Dragon Record, and the holy land geniuses had received the news that the Blue Dragon Record would appear soon.

The golden age would come at that time, and the Divine Dragon Era would welcome a spectacular time. Under Lin Yun’s observation, he noticed that the protagonists of this banquet were the holy land geniuses. After them would be those from the three of the Four Musical Houses, Bai Yunfei, Di Qiu, and Hua Hongyu.

Outside the Ancient Barren Domain, the six holy lands of the Eastern Desolation were the Heavenly Dao Sect, Divine Phoenix Mountain, Heavenly Flame Sect, Ming Cult, Divine Dao Pavilion, and the Myriad Lightning Sect.

Even if they were music dao geniuses, they were still the center of attention at this banquet. As for those extraordinary ones amongst them, like Li Yuxi, he naturally became the true protagonist of this banquet. Even the holy land geniuses were pale in comparison to him.

“Since we’re so happy today, let me play everyone a song.” Li Yuxi smiled.

“Great!” Everyone naturally gave their support since Li Yuxi wanted to play for everyone. If there was no exception, there was a high possibility that Li Yuxi would be first at the Nirvana Banquet. At the very least, achieving the top three shouldn’t be a problem for him. So everyone naturally gave Li Yuxi a face.

“I heard the Profound Fairy is proficient in dance. I wonder if you can cooperate with my song?” Li Yuxi smiled as he looked at Yue Weiwei with flames blazing within his pupils, and he had completely disregarded Lin Yun.

“Young Master Yuxi, I bet you don’t know that the Profound Fairy isn’t only proficient in dancing, but her dancing skills are superb. If the Profound Fairy is willing to dance, it will surely be a joyful matter. Who knows, we might be able to witness the legendary Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.” Hua Hongyu smiled.

“Is that so?” Everyone instantly became even more interested as they looked at Yue Weiwei. They were looking forward to seeing Yue Weiwei’s performance.

“You talk a lot.” Lin Yun said, coldly looking at Hua Hongyu as he placed his cup on the ground. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Did I say anything wrong?” Hua Hongyu smiled.

“Ha.” Lin Yun sneered and threw the wine in his cup forth, splashing the wine on Hua Hongyu’s face.

This instantly made the surroundings fall into a dead silence as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.
