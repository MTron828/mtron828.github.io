Chapter 900 - Mysterious Treasure Box

“What’s wrong? Brother Lin, are you unwilling to help?” Xian Yunzhen looked at Lin Yun with a smile. But this time, his gaze was more indifferent because he wasn’t giving Lin Yun a choice.

By nature, he would make things difficult for others. After all, the disdain that higher realms had towards lower realms ran deep in his bones. Chen Qiong was the same and wouldn’t be so well-behaved if he hadn’t suffered a loss to Lin Yun.

Staring at the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, Lin Yun said, “I don’t mind helping, but I’m curious if someone as noble as Brother Yunzhen resorts to these means when even a common pet can do it?”

Chen Qiong was shocked by Lin Yun’s courage because he could sense the gunpowder in Lin Yun’s words. Clearly, Lin Yun didn’t care about Xian Yunzhen’s identity. The Myriadlight Realm had a terrifying foundation and there was no question about Xian Yunzhen’s strength. As long as he completed his second tribulation, he would have a chance to make it into the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Xian Yunzhen’s smile froze because he could tell that Lin Yun was mocking him. His heart sank, but he maintained a smile and replied, “I’m curious as to what cat or dog can break the ancient restriction in this city. If you can’t find one, then I’ll have to trouble Brother Lin.”

“What a coincidence. I just so happen to have a cat,” replied Lin Yun.

When he looked at the Dragon-blooded Cat slowly standing up on Lin Yun’s shoulder, he was surprised. But before he could react, the Dragon-blooded Cat flew up and threw a punch at the gate. The tiny Dragon-blooded Cat actually released a powerful aura like an ancient Dracoape.

With a crack, the restriction on the Hidden Treasure Pavilion broke from Lil’ Red’s punch. Xian Yunzhen’s face became sour when he saw this. Not only did he fail to put Lin Yun in a disadvantageous position, but he was even humiliated by Lin Yun’s pet. It was the first time he suffered such a setback from the lower realms.

“I’ll be making my move first,” said Lin Yun as he entered the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.

“Let’s go.” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen woke up from their shock and quickly followed behind. Everyone who was hiding in the surroundings were dumbfounded that Lin Yun actually went in.

“Is he not afraid of death? He actually dares to walk together with the higher realms?”

“Why don’t we give it a try?”

“Are you insane? Didn’t you see how powerful Chen Qiong’s punch is? I bet that Lin Yun won’t be able to come back alive.”

“That’s right. The higher realms are known for their brutality. How can they allow Lin Yun to take the treasures from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion?” The spectators began to discuss among themselves, but no one dared to step forward.

As soon as Lin Yun entered the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, he felt a chilling aura. Compared to the blazing heat outside, this place was terrifyingly cold. But Lin Yun didn’t think much about it since he could use his sword intent to protect himself. He carried Lil’ Red and proceeded to walk deeper into the palace.

“Where is he?” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen noticed that Lin Yun was gone. It turned out that the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was a maze. The maze had an eerie feeling that made both of them uncomfortable.

“We should ignore him for now. Do you want to travel together?” Chen Qiong frowned. He could feel that there was something unusual about this place, so he didn’t want to take the risk by himself.

“Let’s go together,” said Xian Yunzhen while nodding his head. A while later, green rays started shining brightly as rotted corpses pounced at them from their sides.

“Demonic corpses!” Xian Yunzhen’s face changed when he saw the rotted corpses. The corpses were probably servants assigned to the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. The demonic aura was probably the reason why they could come back to life after they died.

“Kill them!” Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong were decisive people, so they attacked the demonic corpses without hesitation. The movements of the corpses were stiff, but their explosive speed was incredible. Additionally, their bodies were as tough as iron because they were corroded by the demonic aura. There was no way they could destroy all of the corpses anytime soon unless they hit the vital spots.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Chen Xiong and Xian Yunzhen could instantly kill all the corpses, but that method would exhaust them. So they chose the slow method and spent a long time dealing with the demonic corpses. Chen Qiong suddenly suffered an attack that tore his clothes. If his origin energy wasn’t robust enough, his heart would have been ripped out of his chest. As for Xian Yunzhen, his situation was somewhat better.

Looking at the demonic corpses on the ground, Xian Yunzhen wore a smile. “Since he walked ahead of us, he’ll definitely be in more trouble.”

Chen Qiong had no changes on his face because he knew that Xian Yunzhen was still offended by Lin Yun. But he also shared the same view as Xian Yunzhen as he believed that he wouldn’t lose to Lin Yun if they fought for real. After all, there was a huge gap between their cultivation that would be exposed if Lin Yun only relied on his greater mastery of spiritual sword intent.

“Let’s go. The treasures should be in the main hall. With how dangerous this place is, the treasures must be very precious,” said Xian Yunzhen with excitement in his eyes. When Chen Qiong heard that, his eyes were also filled with excitement. After all, he came all the way to Glorysun Land for its treasures.

If they knew how Lin Yun’s journey was currently progressing, they would be disappointed. Lin Yun’s journey was incredibly smooth as Lil’ Red resolved most of the troubles. It dealt with the enemies because its speed far exceeded Lin Yun’s speed. Plus, it had sharp claws that were comparable to refined dragon claws.

The cultivation technique Yue Weiwei gave Lil’ Red was from the ancient Dracoape Clan. The explosive power of the cultivation technique was naturally unparalleled. It was the perfect technique for Lil’ Red in its cat form since it lacked explosive power. So it made sense that the corpses couldn’t even get near Lin Yun.

Furthermore, Lin Yun’s Lightning Cocoon was the bane of these demonic corpses. Their physiques were comparable to top-tier cosmic artifacts, but his sword could silently enter their bodies. By the time the Lightning Cocoon exploded, the demonic corpses would explode from the inside out.

Naturally, Lin Yun traveled a lot faster than Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. In fact, Lin Yun arrived in the main hall before they could finish killing all the demonic corpses. The main hall was rather spacious with hundreds of chests lying on the ground. Each of them were sealed with spiritual talismans.

Lin Yun was only a third-grade spiritualist, so he could roughly tell that the talismans were meant to seal the chests completely. After all, there were many things in the world that couldn’t be placed into interspatial pouches. For example, Lin Yun’s sword box had to be carried. The worst were the pellets and fruits whose spirituality would leak when placed in interspatial pouches. If they were casually stored, their value would drop drastically.

Before the chests sat an old man on a mat. His clothes were different from the other demonic corpses. Without hesitation, Lil’ Red brought out its claws that shined with an eerie light.

“Let me do it.” Lin Yun stopped Lil’ Red and fixed his eyes on the old man. The aura of this demonic corpse was even stronger than Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. Then again, Lin Yun hadn’t seen them use their full strength and could only make a rough estimation. But he was sure that the demonic corpse before him was just as strong as them.

Lil’ Red quickly put away its claws and observed cautiously. It hadn’t forgotten Yue Weiwei’s command. If something really happened to Lin Yun, Lil’ Red couldn’t imagine what Yue Weiwei would do. Just the thought of Yue Weiwei was enough to send a chill down Lil’ Red’s spine as it became even more alert.

The old man suddenly opened his eyes as two black beams shot out of its eyes. Lin Yun’s face changed because he could sense evil in the beams. The beams were filled with all sorts of negative emotions, but they were torn apart the moment they got close to Lin Yun. He could cut through the invisible emotions with his sword intent, so it wasn’t difficult to defend himself.

When the demonic corpse stood up and pounced, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to summon his Flower Burial Sword. With a roar, he quickly attacked.

An Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him with Iris Flowers blooming on its branches. Lin Yun pushed his sword sutras to the limit as he smoothly moved. He unsheathed his sword and immediately sheathed it.

Before the demonic corpse could get close to him, three Lightning Cocoons exploded in the demonic corpse. In an instant, the demonic corpse turned into a few hundred little pieces. Although the attack seemed easy, Lin Yun didn’t hold anything back. In fact, he also had to bring out his spiritual sword intent at complete mastery. The only thing he held back was his immortal azure dragon aura.

“Looks like I’ve grasped the essence of this attack. As long as I’m fast enough, my opponent won’t be able to see the mist and it’ll be tough for them to block my attack. If there are too many enemies, I can also use the mist to confuse them,” muttered Lin Yun as he analyzed his attack.

With the danger resolved, it was time for Lin Yun to see what was inside the chests. He was exceptionally curious since they were sealed with spiritual talismans.

Lil’ Red’s black figure flashed around the hall as it tore all the talismas apart. Then, Lin Yun opened one of the chests. With a deep breath, Lin Yun was full of shock.
