Chapter 2074 - Shining Stars

Feng Shaoyu’s sword fell onto the Great Sun Sword Star above Lin Yun, and the Flower Burial Sword flew over, aimed at Feng Shaoyu’s back. This caught Feng Shaoyu off guard, and he was forced to dodge.

“You think you can escape?” A cold light flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and soared to the sky, before swinging his sword down.

Feng Shaoyu raised his sword to block the incoming attack. When the Flower Burial Sword and Dragon Bone Sword came into contact, Feng Shaoyu felt a powerful force descending from above him. The power of the Great Sun Sword Star and eighteen galaxies empowered the Flower Burial Sword, causing Feng Shaoyu’s saint aura to crumble as he kept descending.

Then, water splashed. Feng Shaoyu was knocked into the lake. When Lin Yun also entered the lake, they began to clash within the lake, unleashing multiple sword rays that tore the lake into pieces like beancurd. When they dashed out from the lake, the lake exploded and Feng Shaoyu was forced to retreat a thousand meters before he regained his footing.

As Feng Shaoyu and Ye Qingtian continued to clash, everyone noticed that after Ye Qingtian brought out his Astral Sword Intent, Feng Shaoyu was suppressed by him. Feng Shaoyu couldn’t even release his saint aura, but he held his ground by relying on his cultivation and the Blood Purgatory Sword Art.

As Feng Shaoyu and Ye Qingtian began to move, they were like two lightning bolts clashing with their sword rays flying around. Feng Shaoyu wore a sinister expression as he ferociously fought, relying on his sword aura's advantage to target Ye Qingtian’s vitals. This was because Feng Shaoyu had an advantage in his cultivation, so he wasn’t afraid of fighting by using this method of exchanging injuries.

Lin Yun casually faced Feng Shaoyu’s attacks, maintaining his Azure Dragon Sword Heart. No matter how Feng Shaoyu attacked, Lin Yun easily resolved all the incoming attacks and even redirected the saint aura in the attacks elsewhere.

“This is the Azure Dragon Sword Heart that Gu Zijing mentioned?” Feng Shaoyu gradually became irritated as he fought. He now understood why Gu Zijing had such a hard time fighting Ye Qingtian. After Ye Qingtian brought out his Astral Sword Intent, it was nearly impossible for Feng Shaoyu to inflict any injuries. On the contrary, his saint aura was constantly being exhausted.

“I can’t carry on like this. He has only revealed his Astral Sword Intent.” Feng Shaoyu sheathed the Dragon Bone Sword and stomped on the lake to break free from Ye Qingtian’s sword aura. Under the eighteen galaxies, the sword aura around Ye Qingtian was powerful, especially under the radiance of the sword ray, and his saint aura was suppressed by it.

“You can’t get away.” How could Lin Yun possibly let Feng Shaoyu do as he wished? As eighteen galaxies rumbled, he activated the Great Sun Sword Star, forming a massive vortex.

The vortex was so massive that it enveloped Lin Yun and Feng Shaoyu within it. Amidst the loud rumbling noises, the vortex spun and unleashed a powerful suction force. Feng Shaoyu wanted to break free from Ye Qingtian’s sword aura, but the suction force dragged him back.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As the sword flew out, Lin Yun poured his nirvana aura into the Flower Burial Sword. When the sword entered the vortex, sword rays manifested with starlight being shot out. The power of the dazzling sword rays was capable of piercing through the saint aura around Feng Shaoyu, and he would be riddled with holes if he wasn’t careful.

This made Feng Shaoyu feel threatened. He inwardly cussed and charged at Ye Qingtian with murderous intent blazing within his eyes. Saint aura gushed out from his pores as he activated the two glory spirits within his sword and unleashed a powerful sword ray.

Lin Yun calmly waited for Feng Shaoyu to get close to him before summoning the Flower Burial Sword back to his hand.

“Get lost!” Feng Shaoyu roared and injected his saint aura into his sword, with a massive dragon appearing behind him. The dragon was dazzling, with purple flames blazing in its eyes. This was the dragon’s soul within the Dragon Bone Sword, and it had come to life after being infused with saint aura, bringing great pressure to Lin Yun.

Facing this, Lin Yun summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron within his violet palace, and the pressure he felt immediately decreased. Facing the attack from Feng Shaoyu, Lin Yun circulated the destructive power within the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

Empowered by the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, Lin Yun’s nirvana aura transformed and poured it into his sword. When the two swords clashed, they produced an earth-shattering noise before Lin Yun and Feng Shaoyu retreated.

Lin Yun spun in mid-air, activated the two glory spirits within the Flower Burial Sword, and charged at Feng Shaoyu again. With another clash, Lin Yun finally gained the advantage in this fight and sent Feng Shaoyu flying away.

Before Feng Shaoyu could feel the shock, he took this opportunity to retreat and break free from the vortex. Lin Yun and Feng Shaoyu’s figures were revealed when the vortex crumbled.

“How can he be so strong?!” Feng Shaoyu’s heart sank. He couldn’t figure out how he lost in a frontal confrontation with Ye Qingtian.

But Lin Yun didn’t give him the time to think and dashed forth once more with the power of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. After coming this far, Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to conceal his strength any further. Under his attack, Feng Shaoyu was sent flying again with a tear appearing on his clothes.

Lin Yun executed nine swords from the Divine Firefly Sword with nimble movement. Feng Shaoyu barely managed to block the first three swords before using his saint aura to shatter the next three swords. As for the last three swords, he couldn’t block them at all and took them head-on.

Although Feng Shaoyu tried his best to dodge the last attack, a wound still appeared on his face, instantly making his handsome face sinister and shocking everyone.

“Feng Shaoyu is injured?”

“This is the power of Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery? Even a Quasi-Saint’s aura is suppressed. This is too terrifying…” The audience couldn’t describe the shock they were feeling. Even Feng Shengling was nervous as he watched the battle but couldn’t directly look at the dazzling sun.

“The Great Sun Sword Star… How is this possible?” Zhao Wuji was dumbfounded.

Gu Zijing might seem calm, but he was inwardly, deeply shocked. He only guessed that Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent had reached greater mastery, but the reality still shocked him.

On the lake, Feng Shaoyu ferociously glared at Lin Yun and said, “Ye Qingtian, you have surprised me. It’s no wonder why you dare to challenge me.”

“Use whatever means you have left. Otherwise, you should admit defeat,” Lin Yun said.

“You want to take the Cauldron Sword? Dream on!” Feng Shaoyu said coldly. “Let’s end the game now. I can’t be bothered to play with you anymore!”

With a roar, a powerful outburst of saint aura gushed out from Feng Shaoyu. The aura he gave off began to increase. With a terrifying saint aura empowering his sword, the Dragon Bone Sword began to tremble and released a buzzing noise.

As his saint aura soared to the sky, the color of his saint aura began to change from azure to indigo, and the pressure he gave off completely suppressed Lin Yun’s sword intent.

The powerful pressure that Feng Shaoyu gave off sent the spectators standing at the front flying and throwing mouthfuls of blood.

“The Indigo Origin Phase?!” Those who were sent flying back raised their heads in shock.

“The Indigo Origin Phase?”

“How did Feng Shaoyu reach the Indigo Origin Phase? This is too unbelievable! How can the bottleneck at the Quasi-Saint Realm break so easily?!”

“Hasn’t Feng Shaoyu hidden himself too deeply?”

“The battle has come to an end. Ye Qingtian might be talented, but he has no chance against a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase.”

“Even if Feng Shaoyu did just reach the Indigo Origin Phase, he could easily grasp saint dao and crush Ye Qingtian.”

Everyone initially thought that Ye Qingtian would win after seeing Feng Shaoyu get injured. But when they saw Feng Shaoyu reveal his cultivation at the Indigo Origin Phase, they instantly realized that Ye Qingtian had no odds of winning. If it was in the past, those from the Sword Alliance would’ve cheered by now.

But for some reason, they felt uncomfortable because it wasn’t a fair fight for Ye Qingtian. It was too much to get Ye Qingtian to challenge a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase just to stop him from borrowing the Cauldron Sword.

“How can he possibly win this fight?” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master became nervous, with a rage of flames blazing within his pupils. This was because the Hidden Sword Manor was too much!

Feng Shengling and the others were also shocked because Feng Shaoyu should have had a long way to go to reach the Indigo Origin Phase.

“Blood Purgatory Demonic Ray!” Feng Shaoyu swung his sword, shattering all the galaxies in the path of his sword.

Lin Yun soared to the sky to dodge several attacks. But as the galaxies crumbled, the Great Sun Sword Star became much dimmer than before.

“Ye Qingtian, you’ve lost! You can still save your life if you surrender now. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death when I use my full strength,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“Why don’t you come and give it a try, then?”
