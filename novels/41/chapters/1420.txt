Chapter 1421 - Means

Several people flashed as Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and the four brothers of the Huang Clan charged over. They stood before Lin Yun and wore smiles on their faces.

“Flower Burial is really impressive, and I’ve seen your strength today.” Chen Bing squinted his eyes with an ‘amicable’ smile.

“Alright. Lin Yun, you can rest now and leave the rest to us,” said Xiahou Yan. This scene also shocked everyone who was outside the Barren Sword Mound.

“Oh my god, aren’t these people too shameless?”

“Lin Yun was clearly the one who dealt with the Indigo Dragon Serpent, and they didn’t help. But they’re standing out now to claim Lin Yun’s hard work?”

“Xiahou Yan is really shameless. He probably had this idea right from the start.”

“Isn’t Lin Yun a little too pitiful? He was the one who fought the Indigo Dragon Serpent, but someone is going to claim his hard work.” Everyone who saw this scene was furious. Previously, Xiahou Yan was the leading swordsman amongst the younger generation, and Lin Yun had to work hard to catch up to him. But now, Xiahou Yan’s reputation was entirely ruined.

“What did you guys say? Do you guys mind repeating that?” Lin Yun smiled while looking at Xiahou Yan’s party.

“Lin Yun, are we not clear enough?” Huang Yancheng sneered. “We’re saying that you can get lost immediately, or we’ll deal with you as well!”

Xiahou Yan didn’t say a word with his hands tugged together, but the mockery on his face was enough to speak for everything. He was messing with Lin Yun right from the start. No matter what happened between Lin Yun and the Indigo Dragon Serpent, he would be the final winner. So Lin Yun was no different from a chess piece in his eyes.

“Are you guys sure that I’m alone? Is that the reason why you guys are trying to bully me?” Lin Yun asked.

“Are you not? If you have an alliance, Ye Ziyun and Jiang Cheng would’ve helped you long ago.” Xiahou Yan snickered. When Jiang Cheng and Ye Ziyun heard his words, Jiang Cheng was still fine, but Ye Ziyun’s face had turned red with shame.

“Lin Yun, don’t listen to him. If they join hands to bully you, I won’t stand aside and watch.” Ye Ziyun refuted.

“I appreciate your goodwill, but I’m not so desperate to need your help.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he looked at Huang Yancheng. “Huang Yancheng, did you forget your promise?”

“I only said that I won’t make a move against those from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, not you.” Huang Yancheng smiled. “Furthermore, what can you do to me even if I go against my promise? Do you think you can beat all of us? Haha!”

“Don’t regret it, then!” Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed.

“Let’s go!” Xiahou Yan roared upon seeing that Lin Yun had no intention of backing off. But just when they were about to make a move, a roar echoed that instantly enveloped them.

“What’s going on?” The faces of Xiahou Yan and the others changed and became grave. Before they could respond, a mountain came crashing down on them, along with a primitive baleful aura. This was because Lil’ Red had taken the Ancient Dracoape form and swung its staff at them.

“Retreat!” They quickly retreated, but Huang Yancheng was a little slow and took the staff head-on, causing him to spit blood. As he let out a groan, he summoned his constellation. An ocean of flames allowed his flame intent to start rising rapidly.

“You’re courting death!” Huang Yancheng gritted his teeth and swung his sword, turning half of the sky into a sea of flames.

This shocked everyone. Was this the true strength of a genius on the Elysium Core Ranking? They never imagined that Huang Yancheng would become so powerful after summoning his constellation.

Xiahou Yan and Chen Bing let out a sigh of relief when they saw this scene. After they exchanged a glance, they decided to let the four brothers of the Huang Clan hold down the Dracoape while they dealt with Lin Yun. At that time, the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead would still belong to them.

But a bizarre scene occurred. A saint rune appeared on the chest of that Ancient Dracoape, releasing boundless demonic light. When it opened its mouth, the saint rune on its chest was like a bottomless abyss that sucked in all the flames. This left the four brothers of the Huang Clan dumbfounded, especially Huang Yancheng.

His face was stiff because his attack had instantly weakened when the Ancient Dracoape devoured his flames. Before he could react, the dracoape breathed a sea of flames that was mixed with a demonic aura.

Simultaneously, the dracoape swung its staff, causing ripples in its path along the way. This caused Xiahou Yan and Chen Bing’s faces to change. But the dracoape didn’t let them go so easily. It quickly stomped its foot on the ground before chasing after them.

The sudden appearance of the Ancient Dracoape made everyone baffled. Lin Yun was also shocked as he retreated; he didn’t expect Lil' Red to become so powerful after refining the Devour Saint Rune.

As the Golden Crow Wings flapped, Lin Yun went after the Indigo Dragon Serpent while Lil’ Red held the six of them down. Lin Yun only needed to obtain the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead to be the ultimate winner. But two people weren’t any slower than Lin Yun. They were Ye Ziyun and Jiang Cheng. As the three traveled together, they went after the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

“Flower Burial, that was impressive.” Ye Ziyun smiled.

“Didn’t you say that you’ll listen to me?” Lin Yun smiled.

"What is the difference between you and me? If I get a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead, Ziyun will definitely give it to Young Master Lin if you just say the word." Ye Ziyun smiled.

“You guys can carry on and have fun!” Jiang Cheng had no idea what they were talking about. He briefly hesitated before giving up on the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead and went after the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads instead, where Ye Qing was.

The relationship between Ye Ziyun and Lin Yun looked ambiguous, and he had no idea what kind of relationship they were in. So he would rather settle for the next best thing available and sweep the remaining ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads. After all, Xiahou Yan’s party was being held back by the Ancient Dracoape, especially Huang Yancheng, who was being given a beating.

Jiang Cheng’s decisiveness surprised Lin Yun. Truth be told, he was somewhat afraid of Jiang Cheng, who reached the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But he never expected that Jiang Cheng would give up on the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

Lin Yun and Ye Ziyun flew across the vast sword mound, weaving through the majestic and lifeless air current as they chased after the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

“Young Master Lin, there are no outsiders here. So why don’t you understand what’s on Ziyun’s mind?” Ye Ziyun said pitifully.

“I have no idea what’s going through your mind.” Lin Yun smiled while he winked.

“Do you really want me to blatantly say it?” Ye Ziyun wore a hint of bashfulness on her face before she mustered her courage, “Do you believe in love at first sight?”

“I do, but not with you.” Lin Yun said, turning his head back after glancing in the direction where the Indigo Dragon Serpent fled. Ye Ziyun knew how to act, and he would probably fall for her if he had no life experience.

Ye Ziyun looked even more heartbroken after hearing what Lin Yun said. She lightly bit her lips with resolution flashing across her pupils, “If you don’t believe me, you can try and give me a palm. I, Ye Ziyun, won’t try to avoid it!”

Hearing what she said, Lin Yun’s face changed.

But Ye Ziyun simply closed her eyes and waited. But as she was waiting for Lin Yun’s palm, she inwardly chuckled. She had used this tactic a lot and was already proficient with it. Knowing it was time to open her eyes, she smiled. “Do you believe me now? My heart…”

But before she could finish, a palm flew over that drew her exclamation. This palm was enveloped in firmament sword intent with all eighteen Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura poured into it. So Ye Ziyun was quickly sent flying away. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I’ve never heard such a strange request before. What a weirdo.” Lin Yun withdrew his palm, puzzled. Without Ye Ziyun around, a golden light flashed behind Lin Yun. He then appeared before the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

The Indigo Dragon Serpent was still devouring the surrounding sword intent, trying to heal its injuries. But when it saw Lin Yun, it struggled as it ran for its life.

“Are you alright?” Ye Qing gave up competing with Jiang Cheng when he saw Ye Ziyun flying away. In the next second, he already appeared next to her.

“This is too much!” Ye Ziyun stomped her foot on the ground with her brows furrowed.

“Ouch, it hurts…” Because she stomped her foot too hard, she let out a groan. She wasn’t injured because Lin Yun wasn’t serious with that palm. Lin Yun was only trying to push her away, not to mention that she wore saint armor underneath. But that palm still contained Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent, so it was unavoidable for it to sore.

“Damn it! That guy actually laid a hand on women. Ye Qing, can you believe it?! H-H-He’s a scumbag!” Ye Ziyun cried out, feeling wronged. She couldn’t believe that her trick that had worked every time in the past would fail on Lin Yun, causing her to take a palm.

“Didn’t you tell him to hit you…” Ye Qing murmured.

“He hits me when I tell him to? Then what about the love at first sight that I talked about? How can he possibly believe in the words of women? H-H-He’s simply a scumbag!” Ye Ziyun snarled, with her face blushing.

“Then, why don’t I bring some men over and cause some trouble for him? Taking down the Indigo Dragon Serpent is not easy, so we might have a chance!” Ye Qing said after a brief ponder.

“What are you trying to do?” Ye Ziyun glared at Ye Qing. “I only said he’s a scumbag. I didn’t say I want to cause trouble for him. You’re really stupid. Don’t you have any brains?”

Ye Qing’s expression became stiff as he sent a weird look at Ye Ziyun. But after a brief pondering, he decided not to say a word, or he would be called a scumbag as well.
