Chapter 1358 - Why Do I, Lin Yun, Don’t Dare?!

“You continue to put on an act!”

“Kill him!” When the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples saw Lin Yun put on the Silver Moon Mask, they were briefly stunned before their eyes flashed cold with waves of killing intent surging forth. Lei Jue and Xuan Ying let out a cold snort before they charged at Lin Yun.

They had the advantage in numbers, and they were all experts. So they didn’t put Lin Yun in their eyes at all. Let’s not mention that Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were fated transcendents, but they were strong and weren’t that much weaker than Qin Cang, not to mention that there were still thirteen Greater Elysium Core Realm experts and two hundred Elysium Core Realm disciples.

Facing this formation, even Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts wouldn’t be able to face their formation head-on. Not to mention that Lin Yun was arrogant, claiming that he wanted to kill them all. Did he really think that they were mere livestock?

When Qin Cang, who had his physique heavily injured and his constellation destroyed saw this scene, his face drastically changed. His eyes squinted and he became anxious with his heart beating fast. What did these fools think the firmament sword intent was?

He had the Golden Dragon Bone and could release the true dragon aura with it. But even so, he could only barely withstand Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent and had to bring out the two origin saint runes. But even so, when Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, his firmament sword intent suddenly became so powerful that even he couldn’t withstand it.

If those Profound Sky Sect’s disciples retreated now, maybe half of them could survive. But all of them charged at Lin Yun instead, and this was no different from courting death in his eyes. This wasn’t an issue with numbers. The dao of music was proficient in fighting large numbers. It was as though he could see Purgatory before him and furiously roared, “Everyone from the Profound Sky Sect, listen up! Retreat immediately and leave the Profound Wither Island! None of you are allowed to get close to Lin Yun!”

Qin Cang was heavily injured, to begin with, and he had practically exerted the last of his strength to yell out. When he was done, blood dripped down his lips once more. His words instantly left everyone baffled, including the other disciples from the other powerful sects.

Lin Yun had just gone through a series of battles. Even if he wasn’t injured, he would definitely be greatly exhausted. With such a huge formation, not to mention Lin Yun, those from the Profound Sky Sect could even annihilate a sect here if they wanted.

“What is he doing? T-This… I’m still waiting to get his corpse.” Cang Yun rubbed his bald head and his eyeballs rolled around. He was bold and he was still concerned about Lin Yun’s purple-golden dragon runes.

Lei Jue, Xuan Ying, and the rest were also briefly stunned upon hearing what Qin Cang said. Before they could comprehend what he meant, Lin Yun had already started blowing the flute. At that moment, his noble tune had fused together with the firmament sword intent and the saint artifact, the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

As Praise the Phoenix resounded, it sounded like a ferocious roar that echoed across the sky. This instantly made the faces of hundreds of people from the Profound Sky Sect change because they were all enveloped by a boundless sword aura.

Since Lin Yun’s music was empowered by his firmament sword intent, this made everyone from the Profound Sky Sect feel like mere ants. This instantly made the Profound Sky Sect disciples feel as if there was an invisible barrier before them that blocked their path. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lin Yun was clearly far away, but they couldn’t get close to him, no matter how they tried. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s music was like swords leaving cracks on the ground with sword rays blooming brightly, and everyone was facing an unimaginable sword aura.

This made Lin Yun look like a celestial wielding his sword with his hair fluttering in the wind while executing a graceful sword technique. Furthermore, the intent contained within was boundless and massive. Facing Lin Yun, everyone from the Profound Sky Sect, regardless of whether they were a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert or Lei Jue and Xuan Ying, everyone was being suppressed. As Lin Yun played the music, he trapped everyone from the Profound Sky Sect in his music.

But how was that possible? Everyone who saw this scene was left dumbfounded with their mouths wide open. Clad in moonlight, a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him as Lin Yun relied on the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute to suppress hundreds of people.

If it was a Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert that was there, it wouldn’t be so exaggerating. But Lin Yun was only at the pinnacle of the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, which made everyone have disbelief.

“Bring out your constellations!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying’s faces were pale as they exchanged a look and summoned their constellations. When the two fated transcendents summoned their constellations, Lin Yun’s music briefly paused, giving the thirteen Greater Elysium Core Realm experts the opportunity to catch their breath, allowing them to bring out their constellations.

As various phenomenons began to appear, their terrifying auras combined together to push back Lin Yun’s music. At the same time, sound waves spread out in the form of ripples that tried to fall onto Lin Yun.

“Now!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying had joy in their eyes because they knew that their opportunity had come. Knowing that they couldn’t waste this opportunity, they charged towards Lin Yun with rage blazing in their eyes.

Facing them, Lin Yun didn’t panic. The purple mark bloomed on his forehead beneath his mask, activating two sword souls at the same time with his firmament sword intent. At the same time, music continued to resound from the flute.

The flute music sounded like war drums and was beautiful at the same time. He was so immense in playing the music, he had slowly shut his eyes. At the same time, flowers began to dance around with a boundless sword aura starting to accumulate behind Lin Yun. When sword rays shone from him, this made everything pale in comparison to Lin Yun’s sword rays and music as they combined together.

In just a split second, Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were both sent flying back, throwing out a mouthful of blood at the same time. Taking this opportunity, the music from Lin Yun that was briefly suppressed charged forth and swept over once more.

Shortly after, a storm began to sweep with a phoenix tree slowly growing to be a thousand feet in size under the nourishment of Lin Yun’s music and sword intent. At the same time, Lin Yun began to walk on the ground and the music started becoming majestic. Lin Yun wasn’t simply playing music, but was creating a painting with his music. Under his music, flowers began to appear on the phoenix tree and started blooming, looking gorgeous when they shone brightly. As the flowers continued to bloom, his massacre also continued.

“ARGHHH!” A series of screams resounded from amongst the Elysium Core Realm disciples from the Profound Sky Sect. They gradually collapsed and they were covered in wounds by Lin Yun’s sword rays and music. When tens of thousands of flowers bloomed on the phoenix tree, all of heaven and earth were enveloped in a rainbow light.

“Watch out!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying exclaimed before they brought out their strongest attacks. One of them had a Lightning Saint Rune blooming in his palm, while the other was enveloped in afterimages. The flowers were so beautiful that they paired with Lin Yun’s flute music and sword intent that spread over ten thousand miles.

Along with a series of screams, ten-odd Elysium Core Realm disciples from the Profound Sky Sect’s party died on the spot.

“You bastard!” Rage blazed in Qin Cang’s eyes as they became red and he charged towards where the music had enveloped them. But Lin Yun didn’t bother with him. He didn’t let his music envelop Qin Cang, nor did he allow Qin Cang to charge over.

In the next moment, Qin Cang, who had charged over, was sent flying back by the rebound force from Lin Yun’s sword intent. This made Qin Cang throw out a mouthful of blood before he clenched his fist and gritted his teeth as he watched the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples being helplessly butchered. He knew that Lin Yun did this on purpose. Lin Yun wanted him to show him how his companions were being butchered and that there was nothing he could do about it.

When Lin Yun reached the third phase of Praise the Phoenix, his music turned into eight thousand auspicious lights that descended from the sky, enveloping the entirety of the Profound Wither Island. In the blink of an eye, the eight thousand auspicious lights had formed into a golden bridge that reached ten thousand miles away, reaching towards the crown of the phoenix tree.

As Lin Yun’s music changed again, his music suddenly became solemn and his firmament sword intent manifested into tens of thousands of rainbows that flew around like snow. At the same time, two clouds drifted over.

“Holy shit!”

“What’s going on?”

“That’s too beautiful!” Everyone could feel their scalps going numb and nearly went insane because they had never seen something like this before.

“It’s snowing?” Luo Shuyi looked at the rainbow snow while she laid in Su Ziyao’s embrace. This made her eyes become watery as she reached out to grab them.

This made Su Ziyao inwardly let out a sigh before she held onto Luo Shuyi’s hand. “Yeah. The phoenix is coming, and this music is for you. It’s against his path as a swordsman to see women suffering. So Qin Cang will surely be punished for his deeds.”

Her words made Luo Shuyi’s face change as she raised her head and saw two gorgeous birds carrying two clouds. As the clouds passed over the bridge, the two birds then landed on the phoenix tree.

When the two birds landed on the phoenix tree, a resounding, earth-shattering bird cry could be heard. After the birds cried, countless birds began to flock over from various directions and bowed to the phoenix tree.

“Everyone must manage to bear it!”

“He definitely won’t be able to last for long! His firmament sword intent will be exhausted sooner or later!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying’s faces were ugly with ferocity flashing within their pupils, shining with the glory of geniuses belonging to the Profound Sky Sect.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain!”

They were all covered in wounds and blood, but when someone yelled their chant, this instantly incited everyone’s emotions to echo along. As for Lei Jue, Xuan Ying, and the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, they had tears welling in their eyes and could only feel their blood boiling.

Who were they? They were the elites of the Profound Sky Sect, the overlord of the Ancient Barren Domain. So how could they possibly collapse here?

“Steady! After the music’s over, we’ll make him pay the price a hundredfold!” Lei Jue gritted his teeth while he was enveloped in lightning. But right at that moment, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. It was as though he was standing on the summit of the mountain, looking down at everyone. He was like a deity that made everything bow to him.

When he raised his head, the last note of Praise the Phoenix soared into the sky. Aside from Lei Jue, Xuan Ying, and the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, all of the other Elysium Core Realm disciples exploded into clouds of blood. When Lin Yun lowered his flute, Lei Jue and the rest were also bleeding from their seven orifices as they fell to their knees.

“You madman!” Lei Jue, Xuan Ying, and the thirteen Greater Elysium Core Realm deacons struggled back to their feet with their eyes becoming bloodshot.

But Lin Yun merely drew out the Flower Burial Sword and shuttled through the crowd of people. When he appeared before Qin Cang with his sword, the group of people who were heavily injured, to begin with, were torn into pieces by his sword rays.

Drawing his sword, Lin Yun only needed one sword to kill and didn’t even have to turn his head back. This made Qin Cang widen his eyes because Lei Jue and the rest who were still alive just a moment ago were all dead.

“Kill me!” Qin Cang was bleeding from his heart and gritted his teeth, “I, Qin Cang, can afford to lose. So I’m not afraid of death!”

Lin Yun coldly looked at Qin Cang before he continued, “You’re not afraid of losing or death. If I kill you, then it’ll be going easy on you. Don’t worry because I won’t kill you. I’ll dig out your dragon bone, break one of your arms, make you blind, and shatter your meridians. Don’t you like to treat others like ants the most? Then I’ll make you into someone who can’t even be comparable to an ant. If you survive the ordeal and reach the Dragon Pulse Realm, you can come after me and I’ll cripple you again!”

When Qin Cang heard what Lin Yun said, he began to tremble with a chill down his spine. What Lin Yun said was simply too terrifying to him, and it also wasn’t something that he could accept. He hoaxed, “You dare? Those who tried to dig out my dragon bone have all died!”

“Why do I, Lin Yun, not dare?! You’re prideful, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have any temper. Since I said then I’ll dig out your dragon bone, then I’ll definitely dig out your dragon bone!” Lin Yun barked. When he was done, his palm reached towards Qin Cang’s chest.
