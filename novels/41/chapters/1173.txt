Chapter 1174 - Sky Beyond

Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun knew that he had no choice but to go to the Profound Wither Island. He was certain that the painting and sword belonged to the Southern Emperor, but he wasn’t too sure if Hell’s Gate was hidden in the painting.

Lin Yun pulled out the painting again, but he hesitated to open it. He was extremely curious and knew that it would be best if he could find the demons that Senior Hong talked about. But listening to Senior Hong’s instructions, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. Furthermore, he had already looked at the painting numerous times.

He was fearless when he didn’t know anything about it. But now that he knew of the dangers, he felt restricted. Suddenly, he wondered if he should get Lil’ Purple to take a look at it. However, Lil’ Purple was nowhere to be seen..

Lin Yun soon gave up because there was nothing he could do even if the painting was the Life-Death Painting. Furthermore, he had no idea how to use it if the painting was really the Life-Death Painting. He then made up his mind to let go of all the curiosity in his heart. At the very least, he wouldn’t take a look at the painting before entering the Profound Wither Island.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun finally calmed down and muttered to himself, “I’m going to focus on the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Even if I can’t bring them to the manifestation stage, I’ll be able to add them to my trump cards.”

The last three swords were named the Emerald Stars, Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds, and Sky Beyond. He had reached greater mastery in the last three swords, and he could unleash terrifying power with them using the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra.

They might be comparable to the Holy Spirit Martial Techniques or even exceed the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Others would be satisfied if they could achieve this power, but Lin Yun wasn’t. In his view, he had to reach complete mastery at the very least.

But if he wanted to reach the top ten in the ranking battle, he would definitely need to reach the manifestation stage. If he managed to bring those three swords to the manifestation stage, he would reach the manifestation stage in the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

The biggest advantage to the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was the ability to wield multiple holy spirits. Wielding 13 Azure Birds created a ferocity and lethality that far exceeded holy spirit martial techniques of the same grades.

Then again, the flaw was also pretty obvious. He would exhaust a lot of vitality to control all the birds. However, it wasn’t a big flaw since Lin Yun had wielded the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, not to mention that he could easily control the Azure Birds using the divine firmament sword intent.

He had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and his foundation far exceeded those in the same cultivation as him. So vitality wasn’t an issue to him. Furthermore, Lin Yun also knew that the holy spirits of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords were never the Azure Birds. Only by reaching complete mastery in the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords and combining the sword sutra and sword technique could one unleash the genuine holy spirit.

Tossing Southern Emperor’s affairs to the back of his mind, Lin Yun focused all his attention on the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. In the blink of an eye, eleven days had passed. There were ten Azure Birds revolving above Lin Yun, vividly with boundless sword aura. As for Lin Yun, his sword aura was as massive as a mountain. When the two different sword auras combined, the massive field where he stood looked small.

“Emerald Stars!” Lin Yun took a deep breath and swung his sword out. The entire field began to tremble violently as countless sword auras flew out. When Lin Yun executed the Emerald Star, another Azure Bird flew out from Lin Yun’s body.

When 11 Azure Birds revolved in the sky, the sky cracked as a boundless starry sky appeared above Lin Yun. Then, a colossal figure appeared in the starry sky and descended to the earth. When the gigantic figure overlapped with Lin Yun, a dazzling sword ray flew out.

Under that sword, space cracked while boundless starlight rained down like a waterfall. At the same time, 11 Azure Birds constantly revolved around Lin Yun and made the sword ray expand violently.

The spiritual array protecting the entire field immediately shattered. Right at this moment, Lin Yun soared into the sky once more, “Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds!”

When a boundless sea of clouds unfolded behind him, Lin Yun’s sword aura manifested into an azure mountain at complete mastery. But since Lin Yun was aiming for the manifestation stage, he naturally had his own understanding and comprehension.

WIth the sea of clouds surrounding him, Lin Yun’s sword aura and sword became heavy. Under the bizarre gravity, the space around him began to distort as the boundless sea of clouds instantly condensed into a vortex that devoured the 12 Azure Birds.

When Lin Yun stabbed his sword out, a terrifying white vortex appeared that could even devour space. This sword could be used to attack and defend. After swinging out two swords, the sword aura behind Lin Yun had reached an unprecedented height.

At this moment, he was like the Sword Saint Mountain. Standing on the summit of the mountain, Lin Yun swung the last sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, Sky Beyond. A resounding bell rang out with a terrifying sword aura that radiated throughout the heavens and earth. This time, his sword had directly shattered the first layer of heaven.

When a starry sky appeared, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Vermillion Bird Constellations appeared. Lin Yun stood in the sky like a lofty mountain as boundless starlight shined down on him.

“I finally succeeded.” Lin Yun let out a long sigh as exhaustion flashed through his pupils. The sword didn’t have a grand phenomenon initially, but with his comprehension on Spirit Astral Mountain, it became grand.

The Spirit Astral Mountain could shatter the fourth layer of heaven using the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect as the foundation. There was naturally no way Lin Yun could compete with an entire sect, but the sword aura of his Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was comparable to the Sword Saint Mountain.

Today was the first time he succeeded in achieving such a phenomenon. Lin Yun returned to a seated position and the 13 Azure Birds still hovered around him. When the Azure Birds let out a sharp cry, they revolved around Lin Yun before forming a blue barrier.

The insides of the barrier looked like a domain formed by a sword, containing a terrifying surge of sword aura that could easily tear apart a genius in the Star Stage. But the Azure Birds didn’t disappear as Lin Yun casually stabbed the Flower Burial Sword to a corner.

He could tell that it was time for the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords to appear. Placing both his hands on his knees, Lin Yun formed different seals and circulated the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. As he circulated the sword sutra, he easily controlled the Azure Birds around him.

“Condense!” A sword ray flashed on Lin Yun’s fingers and the entire sky turned dark. A terrifying gale appeared, which made his residence look like the apocalypse was here.

The phenomenon wasn’t contained to Lin Yun’s residence. Everyone in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was looking at the scene in the sky. Even the sect master squinted his eyes as he looked at L:in Yun’s residence from afar, “What’s this brat doing?”

“Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Myriad Sword Condensation!” The sword seal formed in Lin Yun’s hand as the 13 Azure Birds combined together to form an azure longsword flickering with lightning. Under the radiance of the sword ray, the rocks, dust, metal, and grass disappeared from the ground. Instantly, the entire field was barren, with no traces of vitality left behind.

The azure sword was like the king of all swords, instantly summoning countless swords in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. As tens of thousands of swords landed on the ground, the field looked like a graveyard of swords as the azure longsword seemed to have devoured all the sword rays from the swords.

Seeing that there was no sign of stopping, the sect master waved his hand and a bell rang. This made all the swords flying toward Lin Yun’s residence fall to the ground, allowing each owner to sigh a breath of relief.

“King of Swords…” Lin Yun was shocked as he looked at the azure longsword. The genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords had shocked him. Not only was it powerful, but it had also devoured the sword aura from all the swords it had summoned over.
