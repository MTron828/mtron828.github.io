Chapter 1580 - Lord Lin, Save Me!

The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze because he was the same as himself back then, wanting to strengthen the Sword Sect with the sword in his hand. But after three thousand years, he only obtained the title of one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation. The Sword Sect was still far from returning to being a holy land.

“Come, get up.” The Radiant Sword Saint came forth and helped Lin Yun up.

“Thank you, Master.” Lin Yun said.

“Cultivate well here and leave after reaching lesser mastery in the four sword forms.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun then spent his time practicing the four sword forms there, and he had to admit that the four sword forms were a king’s sword. The power behind each sword form was immense, making Lin Yun feel a little afraid even when he only reached lesser mastery.

With his physique, he could barely take an attack head-on. If he took all four sword forms head-on, there was no doubt that he would die. Even with saint armor and the Blue Dragon Bone, he would die without a complete corpse.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Such a sword technique was rare, and perhaps only the Overlord Sword he had learned in the Profound Amber Realm could be compared to it. Then again, they were only comparable in terms of their intent. The difference between them was enormous.

Every day, Lin Yun would practice the four sword forms to be proficient in the nine hundred varieties. Undoubtedly, this process would be dry, but he could clearly sense the improvements. Seven days later, he had finally reached the lesser mastery in the four sword forms.

Lin Yun knew that this was all thanks to his master. If his master didn’t fasten the time, he would need at least six months to reach lesser mastery. Under his master’s training, the four sword forms had long become his instinct.

Suddenly, Lin Yun grabbed the Flower Burial Sword with his left hand while seated on the ground. Swinging out the sword with the sheath on it, he knocked away a tree branch. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he noticed the terrifying sword aura in that tree branch. After the tree branch was knocked away, it exploded into a plum blossom and emitted a dazzling sword ray.

“You have already reached lesser mastery in those four sword forms, and they have increased your sword intent. If there’s an opportunity, you can try and grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled. That attack from him was a probe.

“Are you serious about that?” Lin Yun rejoiced.

“Since when have I lied to you?” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled.

Lin Yun became excited because this was a surprise. He had long wanted to try it after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. But the previous failure greatly affected him, and his confidence was significantly boosted after receiving his master’s acknowledgment.

“Master, I realized that it’s hard for me to improve after reaching lesser mastery. I have clearly grasped the profundity of those sword forms. So why is that so?” Lin Yun asked. The four sword forms were weird, and he ran into a bottleneck after reaching lesser mastery. If he couldn’t find a solution, he might stop at lesser mastery, no matter how he practiced.

“That’s because you didn’t grasp those four martial intents, which is why you can’t reach greater mastery. This is also why I want you to reach lesser mastery, first.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled, looking at Lin Yun. “Don’t be in a hurry. Well, there’s also a solution to it. You must find four types of hundred-year ominous aura and fuse them into your sword techniques.”

“Ominous aura?”

“That’s right, the Ominous Wind, Ominous Fire, Ominous Lightning, and Ominous Ice. If you’re not going to grasp those martial intents, you just need those ominous auras, which are not hard to find in the Withered Mountain Range.” The Radiant Sword Saint replied.

“Okay. I’ll take my leave now.” Lin Yun nodded. It looks like he had to make another trip to the Withered Mountain Range. Anyhow, it was on his schedule to take a look at the stone tablet again.

“Wait. I have a pouch here.” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression and continued, “Keep this pouch with you and don’t open it. Don’t ask me what’s in there, either.”

“Then, when am I supposed to open it?” Lin Yun was a little baffled by those words.

“You’ll know when it’s time to open it.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled.

“That mysterious?” Lin Yun briefly observed the pouch before carefully storing it. After leaving Saint Mountain, Lin Yun pondered and ultimately decided to look for that tiger in the Withered Mountain Range for information about ominous auras. When he returned to the Cloud Soaring peak, he saw a woman who had been waiting there for some time.

“Senior Sister Mu?” Lin Yun quickly came forth and asked, “What are you doing?”

“I’m naturally here, waiting for you.” Mu Xueqin opened her eyes and smiled, “Aren’t you looking for the blood of the Black Tortoise bloodline? Divine blood is hard to find, but I have news of demonic beasts possessing the Black Tortoise Bloodline.”

“Where?”

“Take a look, yourself. I’ve marked them on the map.” Mu Xueqin took out a map of the Ancient Barren Domain and handed it to Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun opened the map, there were ten red circles, and each circle had more detailed information.

“The Heavenly Profound Tortoise in the Divine Tortoise Mountain, life-stage Samsara Edict Realm!”

“The Gold Blood Flying Serpent in the Demonic Serpent Woods, pinnacle death-stage Samsara Edict Realm!”

Lin Yun had joy flashing in his pupils while looking at those red circles marked on the map. The information was pretty detailed, it’s just that they weren’t easy to deal with. They were practically Samsara Edict Realm demonic beasts, and there were even those in the Saint Realm. The light in his eyes gradually dimmed, and he could feel his scalp tingling.

“Looks like I’m expecting too much.” Lin Yun returned the map and knew why Mu Chuan had given up.

But Mu Xueqin couldn’t help smiling when she looked at Lin Yun’s response.

“Senior Sister, what are you laughing at?” Lin Yun rubbed his head.

“I’m just teasing you. I naturally knew you didn’t have the strength to deal with them. Only the peak masters might have a slight chance if they personally make a move, and the map is only for you to see. There are other sources of information regarding the Black Tortoise bloodline.” Mu Xueqin smiled.

“What source?”

“There’s a young Heavenly Profound Tortoise in the Withered Mountain Range hidden deep in the Cold Pond, and its strength should be comparable to the initial Dragon Pulse Realm.” Mu Xueqin said.

“It shouldn’t be hard to deal with, then.”

“But you can’t afford to be careless. After all, it’s a demonic beast possessing the Black Tortoise bloodline. These demonic beasts are tough to deal with upon reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. Oh, there’s another reason why I’m here. It’s something I have to tell you personally.”

“What is it?”

“Several demonic cultivators barged into the Withered Mountain Range.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled, “Demonic cultivators? The Withered Mountain Range is huge, spreading throughout the Ancient Barren Domain. So it’s not weird for there to be demonic cultivators there.”

The Withered Mountain Range was massive. Not only were the various sects’ disciples there, but it was common to find demonic cultivators there, too. Let’s not mention that most demonic cultivators didn’t dare to do anything if they ran into other sects’ disciples, especially disciples of powerful sects.

“These four demonic cultivators aren’t the same. They were initially disciples of powerful sects and were infamous in the Ancient Barren Domain, especially the leader, Jiang Tong. He was a disciple of the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking. But he was expelled from the sect after violating the rules and became a demonic cultivator.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. Every sect had its own rules, and it was common for those who violated the rules to be expelled. But for someone on the Inner Ranking to be expelled only meant that this person had committed a grave crime.

“I’m just reminding you. The Withered Mountain Range is huge, and it’s hard to find them, even if you wanted to.” Mu Xueqin smiled. “Well, it’s impossible for there to be such a coincidence that they’re also looking for the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, right? I’ll not bother you any longer.” Mu Xueqin left in a hurry after sharing the information with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was pondering his upcoming journey to the Withered Mountain Range, and it was pretty convenient that he could find the ominous auras and Black Tortoise’s Divine Blood there. More accurately, the Divine Blood of the Black Tortoise’s bloodline couldn’t be considered Divine Blood.

After all, demonic beasts who possessed the bloodline of a divine beast were naturally significantly thinned, and it couldn’t be compared to the blood of an actual divine beast. So it was more appropriate to call it the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood, just like True Dragon Saint Liquid wasn’t made with the blood of dragons.

Lin Yun rested for two days before he left the sect. Since he had been to the Withered Mountain Range multiple times, he was pretty familiar with the way and soon arrived in the Demonic Rune Tiger’s den.

“It’s not here? Don’t tell me something happened to it.” Lin Yun released his sword intent but still couldn’t sense the Demonic Rune Tiger’s aura. There was a high chance that something had happened to it. After all, countless demonic beasts lost their lives to human cultivators daily in the mountain range. The Demonic Rune Tiger might be a monarch demonic beast, but it wasn’t invincible, and its Tiger King Bone was naturally attractive to many people.

Lil’ Red briefly sniffed from Lin Yun’s shoulder before pointing its paw in a direction. Seeing this, Lin Yun briefly pondered before executing his movement technique and headed in the direction Lil’ Red pointed out, “Let’s go and take a look, then.”

An hour later, Lin Yun stood on a tree branch, looking at the open ground ahead. A human and a tiger were fighting, and that human wore a smile. As for the tiger, it was naturally the Demonic Rune Tiger!

The Demonic Rune Tiger had taken on its human form, wielding the saint blade and executing its blade technique. If it faced an ordinary opponent, it would’ve long slaughtered them. But its opponent was clearly having an easy time and didn’t use their full strength.

Lin Yun casually looked at this person and noticed this person had reached the late phase third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and their vitality was like an ancient beast that had far exceeded the Demonic Rune Tiger. They were a bladesman but didn’t even draw their sword when facing the Demonic Rune Tiger.

While Lin Yun was pondering, a blade ray blossomed, and the Demonic Rune Tiger was sent flying back. When the Demonic Rune Tiger fell to the ground, it was wailing out in pain. Seeing this, Lin Yun could only come down from the tree because this tiger would be dead if he continued to watch.

When the Demonic Rune Tiger heard the commotion created by Lin Yun, it rejoiced and quickly crawled over, “Lord Lin, save me!”

“Brother, can you give me face and spare this Demonic Rune Tiger’s life?” Lin Yun didn’t bother about the Demonic Rune Tiger and looked at the black-clothed person.

“Tsk, tsk. Interesting, but what if I don’t give you any face?” The black-clothed person was surprised because he had never seen a friendship between a human and a demonic beast before. His gaze was playful, and felt that Lin Yun was here to snatch the Tiger King Bone. But he didn’t know where someone who had just entered the Dragon Pulse Realm got the courage to stand before him. But after seeing Lin Yun’s clothes, he finally realized that Lin Yun was a disciple of the Sword Sect.

“You have to look at the owner before beating the dog, not to mention that this is a tiger. You can tell me your terms for letting this tiger go.” Lin Yun said.

“Tsk, tsk. You’re the owner of this tiger?” The black-clothed person smiled as if he had heard a huge joke.

“Not me, him.” Lin Yun pointed to Lil’ Red on his shoulder with a smile. “I have a good temper, but my cat doesn’t.”

The black-clothed person was stumped, and his cheek twitched. His gaze was clearly asking Lin Yun if he was joking.
