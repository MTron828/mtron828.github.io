Chapter 1544 - Three Hundred Years (2)

“Three hundred years ago, after Mu Xuankong became a saint, he stayed within the Sword Sect without taking a step out. I’m afraid his name as a saint doesn’t hold much weight,” smiled the Grand Elder, Qin Jue. “He might be a fake saint. The rules in the Ancient Barren Domain should have changed a long time ago. Only Tian Xuanzi has the patience to insist on waiting for the Radiant Sword Saint’s passing.”

“It’s fine if he doesn’t come. But if he dares to come, I’ll destroy his name!” Qin Xiao arrogantly said.

“Sword Sect’s Mu Xuankong wishes to meet the current patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan!” When a resounding voice echoed, the entire Nether Divinity Clan began to tremble as the hundreds of floating palaces swayed. It was as though they would collapse in the next moment.

Nearly a hundred thousand people within the Nether Divinity Clan were horrified to discover a sun suddenly appear in the sky, and the source of that voice came from the sun.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What’s going on?”

“Mu Xuankong! Why is the Sword Sect’s sect master here? Is that really a sun?”

“Isn’t this a little too terrifying?” The entire Nether Divinity Clan was shocked, and all the disciples under the Samsara Edict Realm felt dizzy. They had difficulty standing firmly on the ground.

Simultaneously, a boundless sword intent descended from the sky. The sword intent was so terrifying that the Nether Divinity Clan’s layers of saint spiritual arrays didn’t have any effects.

“He’s really here?” Everyone within the main hall exchanged glances, and they were all dumbfounded. After all, they were just discussing this matter a moment ago, and none of them had placed Mu Xuankong in their eyes. But when they really heard Mu Xuankong’s voice, they couldn’t conceal the fear within their pupils.

“Patriarch!”

“Mu Xuankong is here!” Countless people flew into the sky from different directions and gathered towards the main hall.

No one dared to reply to those words because they would have to face Mu Xuankong and could clearly sense the killing intent radiating from the latter. Who would dare to step forth at this moment?

If they fought Mu Xuankong, they wouldn’t know how they died. So the entire hall fell into dead silence as countless gazes were fixed on the patriarch, Qin Xiao. On the other hand, Qin Xiao’s face had become extremely ugly.

“Sword Sect’s Mu Xuankong wishes to meet the current patriarch of the Nether Divinity Clan!” This time, Mu Xuankong’s voice contained his sword intent, and it became even more terrifying. As his voice echoed, all the Kings in the main hall, aside from those who reached the pinnacle of Samsara Edict Realm, threw out a mouthful of blood.

Ten floating palaces fell from the sky when that voice echoed this time. Not long later, the entire Nether Divinity Clan was in a mess, with everyone in a pathetic state. The whole place was covered in a cloud of dust, with groups of palaces collapsing.

In the main hall, everyone’s faces were ugly because Mu Xuankong didn’t give them any face and immediately made a move.

“That Mu Xuankong really dared to come here!” Qin Xiao flew into a rage.

He quickly left the hall and soared into the sky with all the elders following him. It didn’t take long for the group to appear above the Nether Divinity Clan, and they were having a face-off with Mu Xuankong, who was a thousand meters away.

“Mu Xuankong, what is the mean of this? Are you bullying my Nether Divinity Clan’s ordinary disciples as a saint? What are you trying to do here? If you don’t explain today, I won’t let you off so easily!” Qin Xiao coldly said.

Mu Xuankong didn’t give him any face. His action was the same as slapping the Nether Divinity Clan on the face. Who knew how many people were watching in the dark, and the Nether Divinity Clan’s prestige would fall if he didn’t handle this matter well.

As Mu Xuankong walked out from the ‘sun,’ he was basking in golden light with a scarlet longsword hovering before him. He was looking at Qin Xiao and asked, “Where is he?”

Qin Xiao’s face changed when he heard that, and his aura instantly dropped. He replied, “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”

“You don’t know?” Rage flashed across Mu Xuankong’s pupils. He ran out of patience after trying to talk to Qin Xiao and quickly waved his right hand.

As boundless flames surged from the four directions, waves of solar sword intent combined with his saint aura swept out. Everything happened too quickly. The remaining floating palaces in the Nether Divinity Clan were all destroyed.

Although several spiritual arrays rose from beneath the Nether Divinity Clan and overlapped, the spiritual arrays still couldn’t stop Mu Xuankong’s attacks. As saint runes began to shatter, a small portion of the Nether Divinity Clan was turned into ruins.

This instantly left all the Nether Divinity Clan’s disciples dumbfounded. Such terrifying power had far exceeded their imagination, and it made no sense for a saint to be so frightening. To destroy the layers of spiritual arrays that the Nether Divinity Clan was proud of as though they were paper with a wave of the hand. Before Mu Xuankong, the spiritual arrays couldn’t even pose any effect.

“Mu Xuankong!” Qin Xiao flew into a rage, with his face instantly becoming black. He roared, “Is the Sword Sect going to wage war with the Nether Divinity Clan?!”

“Why not?” Mu Xuankong raised his brow.

Qin Xiao’s words were choked in his throat, and he couldn’t say a word. This was because Mu Xuankong didn’t hesitate to say those words, and he couldn’t figure out where Mu Xuankong got the confidence to say those words.

“I’ll ask you again. Where is he?!” Mu Xuankong questioned as he glared at Qin Xiao. His sword intent began to frantically rise, and the scarlet longsword hovering before him also began to tremble.

His hair was violently fluttering in the wind as he became enveloped in a killing aura. Based on the current aura he released, no one dared look him straight in the eyes.

“Mu Xuankong, don’t push it! I’ve become a saint long before you did, and you’re still a child when I became a saint!” Qin Xiao mocked while gritting his teeth.

“I’m the sect master of the Sword Sect. Who gave you the right to call me by my name?” Mu Xuankong replied as his sword aura swept out.

Facing Mu Xuankong’s aura, Qin Xiao was forced to take several steps back while those who were behind him were sent flying away, throwing out mouthfuls of blood.

“I’ll ask you one last time. WHERE IS HE?!” Mu Xuankong took a step forth, and the scarlet longsword before him began to vibrate even more violently. The scarlet longsword was like a dragon trying to break free from its shackles as it began to accumulate its aura. Simultaneously, sword vibrations that sounded like saint music echoed within the area.

Since Qin Xiao suffered a loss, his face turned back, and he mocked, “Mu Xuankong, I’ll tell you where he is! He’s already in the Divine Dragon Empire by now! Aren’t you the sect master of the Sword Sect? Aren’t you almighty? Then go to the Divine Dragon Empire and kill him, if you have the guts!”

When Mu Xuankong heard that, his face became dark, and he coldly said, “You’re really fearless. Do you think that I’ll let this matter rest so easily? Since he’s not around, you can use your life, instead!”

As Mu Xuankong held onto his sword, a massive sun rose behind him. The sun was emitting a dazzling radiance that outshone all the light in this world, giving off the feeling that an apocalypse was about to descend. When a blazing heat swept out and enveloped this world, it suddenly felt scorching for everyone.

Mu Xuankong hadn’t drawn his sword for three hundred years, nor did he take a step out of the Sword Sect for the past three hundred years. But today, Mu Xuankong wanted to slay saints by drawing his sword!
