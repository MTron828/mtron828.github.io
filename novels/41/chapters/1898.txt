Chapter 1899 - What Do I Want?

Zhang Yue’s face was ashen as he sat on the ground. The appearance of the Sky Pillar Pellet made his face even darker, making the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign furious. The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s cheeks trembled, wanting to slaughter Zhang Yue for embarrassing him.

Facing Lin Yun’s questions, the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face turned pale, and he coldly looked at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, do you know the identity of the Dragon Origin Great Saint? You must be tired of living by slandering his name, and I can kill you on the spot now!”

When everyone heard what the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign said, their faces changed because they knew that the latter was genuinely furious. If he killed Ye Qingtian on the spot, no one could say a word about it. After all, anyone who dared to joke around with the Great Saint’s name was simply courting death.

But Lin Yun was calm as he smiled, “It’s unsure if the Dragon Origin Great Saint will punish me for what I said, but I know that the Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t let you off if you dare to kill me.”

“What do you mean?” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign coldly said.

“I’ll be honest with you. I am now the direct disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and I’m only waiting for the Azure River Sword Saint’s return before we hold the official ceremony,” Lin Yun indifferently smiled.

The moment he said that his words, it was like thunder was rumbling within everyone’s minds, and their faces drastically changed.

After all, Lin Yun had just become a saint disciple. So how did he become the disciple of a Great Saint? Not to mention his notorious reputation within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Didn’t that mean that Ye Qingtian had risen to the sky?

Everyone initially didn’t believe it, including the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign and the Serene Dust Great Saint. But Lin Yun didn’t waste time explaining and took out a medal. He smiled, “This is the medal to prove my identity as the Dragon Origin Great Sovereign’s disciple. It might not be official yet, but I can receive the treatment of a direct disciple with this medal. I believe the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign recognizes this medal.”

“H… How is this possible?!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was shocked because he had planned to kill Ye Qingtian earlier. So Lin Yun’s words naturally left him dumbfounded.

“Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign, you better let your disciple explain himself. What does he mean by bringing the Sky Pillar Pellet to peek at my master showering? Is he trying to do anything to my master?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips rose as arrogance flickered within his pupils.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face turned red after hearing what Lin Yun said, and the Sky Pillar Pellet in his hand felt like a hot potato. He never expected that a junior would force him into such a dead-end, and he was on the verge of losing his temper.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign suppressed his anger, and said, “Ye Qingtian, I will give your master an explanation. If my disciple really did it, I will punish him accordingly.”

“I’ll wait for you, then. Don’t forget what you just said,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Tu You, why are you holding it against a junior? Ask your disciple what he was trying to do by walking around with the Sky Pillar Pellet. If he’s still unwilling to say anything, we can bring the Dragon Origin Great Saint over and ask him about it.” The Serene Dust Great Saint furrowed her brows.

The corner of the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s lips twitched upon hearing what the Serene Dust Great Saint said. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint really came, he would probably kill Zhang Yue on the spot.

“Zhang Yue, speak! What happened last night, and why were you carrying this Sky Pillar Pellet?!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign roared. “If the Dragon Origin Great Saint really comes, no one can protect you.”

“Master, I really have my difficulties…” Zhang Yue said as he collapsed on the ground.

“You’re still not going to say?!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign finally lost his temper, and his facial expression became cold. “You think I can’t find the truth if you’re not willing to tell me? You can still retain some face if you speak. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint comes, he can extract your soul and search it to find out what happened last night. This is your last chance, so speak!”

Zhang Yue finally panicked when he heard what his master said. He naturally knew the means of a Great Saint. Not to mention a Great Saint, but even a Saint Sovereign had plenty of means to make him speak. The reason why he kept his mouth shut was because he believed that his master would protect him.

But after Lin Yun came and brought out the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s medal, there was nothing the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign could do, even if he wanted to protect him. Thus, this immediately placed Zhang Yue in a difficult position. His gaze alternated between the Serene Dust Great Saint, Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign, and Ye Qingtian before he ultimately lowered his head. “I was cultivating within the Dao Yang Palace last night until I received a letter…”

“What was written on the letter?” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign roared.

Zhang Yue lowered his head. But facing the immense pressure, he could only speak out with a sob, “It’s written on the letter that the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden has been in love with me for years, and she wanted to spend the night with me…”

“So you left your residence with the Sky Pillar Pellet?”

“Yeah.” Zhang Yue nodded his head, but he soon discovered that it was Ye Qingtian who had asked that question. When he raised his head, he saw Ye Qingtian looking at him with a playful smile, instantly driving him insane.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Master, that’s not the case…” Zhang Yue quickly turned to the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was immediately left dumbfounded, and he instantly figured out what had happened. But it was more humiliating after knowing the truth because his disciple fell for such a simple trap, and he even ran to the meeting location with the Sky Pillar Pellet.

Everyone in the surroundings was stumped, and an uproar broke out the next moment. Even Bai Shuying was stumped because she didn’t expect this matter would implicate her, and murderous intent soon filled her pupils.

“Zhang Yue, what nonsense are you talking about? How can our senior sister possibly fall for someone like you?”

“Why don’t you take a look at yourself in the mirror? You said our senior sister wants to spend the night with you? You really know how to dream!”

“Do you think the Nether Orchid Courtyard is a pushover?! We’ll report this matter to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint to have a lecher like you killed!” The disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard immediately burst with anger, and even Bai Shuying’s facial expression was terrifyingly dark.

Seeing so many people wanting to charge over, this terrified Zhang Yue and he immediately explained, “I know that I’m in the wrong. I later figured out that Senior Sister Bai wouldn’t write something like that, and I was muddle-headed for a moment.”

“Muddle-headed? I feel that what they’re saying is right. Just look at yourself. Let’s not mention the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden; who in their right mind will fall for you? Even a pig won’t believe what’s written in the letter!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign sneered.

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign might be scolding Zhang Yue, but he was actually trying to protect his disciple by dismissing the rage of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples. Otherwise, Zhang Yue would be in deep trouble if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint hears about this.

“Why aren’t you apologizing to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden?!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign roared.

“There’s no need. This is your Dao Yang Palace’s matters,” Bai Shuying said coldly. She wasn’t even willing to take another glance at Zhang Yue.

But the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples naturally wouldn’t let this go so easily. They were still cussing Zhang Yue.

“What happened then?” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign asked.

“I was ambushed after that by a masked person, a cat, and a little girl,” Zhang Yue explained. “But the ones who attacked me were the cat and the little girl. That little girl was terrifying, quickly inflicting severe injuries on me. The cat might seem ordinary, but it nearly killed me with a slap.”

The moment he explained, everyone in the surroundings burst into laughter. In the end, Zhang Yue was beaten by a cat and a little girl? This was the biggest joke they had heard in their lifetime.

“How dare you lie again!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign lost his temper and slapped Zhang Yue.

The slap made Zhang Yue throw out a mouthful of blood, but he still argued, “There’s really a cat!”

“Still lying?!” The corner of Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s lip twitched, and he gave Zhang Yue another slap.

“Master… There’s really a cat!” Zhang Yue was slapped to the point he broke down and cried.

“I’ll kill you, bastard!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was furious. He would have rather had Zhang Yue not say anything right from the beginning. After all, this meant that a cat beat his disciple, which greatly humiliated him. The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was so furious that he began to cough, with the two Quasi-Saints beside him comforting him.

The Serene Dust Great Saint said, “I believe he’s speaking the truth and shouldn’t dare to lie. But even if he’s innocent, he shouldn’t be so shameless. He practically deserves what he has suffered. So the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign can determine how to deal with him!”

Those words made the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face change, and he had no idea what to say now that the Serene Dust Great Saint tossed the ball back to him. He knew that the Serene Dust Great Saint was signaling him to abolish Zhang Yue’s identity as a saint disciple, or this matter wouldn’t be put to rest.

But the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign wasn’t willing to abolish Zhang Yue’s identity as a saint disciple because he held the latter in high hopes. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken Zhang Yue as his disciple.

“In my opinion, why don’t we castrate him?” A voice resounded right at this moment. This voice wasn’t loud, but it was filled with murderous intent that made Zhang Yue feel a chill run down his spine as he clamped his legs together.

When everyone turned their attention over, the corner of their lips twitched because it was Ye Qingtian who spoke.

“Ye Qingtian, are you done? The Serene Dust Great Saint and I will deal with this matter, so you can get lost. Stop interfering!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign roared.

Lin Yun didn’t argue with him, but nodded, “Alright. I’ll get lost and tell my master about this matter. I have to seek justice for my master, and I can get him to search Zhang Yue’s soul and see if he peeked at my master showering.”

He didn’t hesitate to turn around and wanted to leave, but this left the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign dumbfounded. Even the Serene Dust Great Saint had widened her mouth in shock because Ye Qingtian was too shameless.

Everyone in the surrounding area also widened their mouths in disbelief. They didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian could be so shameless.

“Ye Qingtian, stop right there!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign called out to Lin Yun, and he even released his saint aura to stop Lin Yun from taking another step forth.

Lin Yun reached out and felt an invisible barrier ahead of him.

“Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign, what do you mean? Or do you want me to get lost by rolling on the ground?” Lin Yun said. He even wanted to get down on the ground to roll away.

But the Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign couldn’t be bothered about that and stepped forth to stop Lin Yun. He said, “Ye Qingtian, I was a little anxious earlier. If you really rolled on the ground, the Dragon Origin Great Saint won’t let me off. So don’t force me. You can just say what you want.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he said, “Didn’t I say it earlier? You can just castrate him.”

“You!” The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign was furious, but he still suppressed his anger and whispered, “Ye Qingtian, don’t forget what you did in the past.”

He wanted to threaten Lin Yun that if Zhang Yue were castrated, Lin Yun would also have to be castrated.

“Saint Sovereign, did you make a mistake? Mine is because of love, so how can it be compared to your disciple? Furthermore, I didn’t bring a Sky Pillar Pellet with me. Just because your disciple can’t get hard, it doesn’t mean others can’t get hard, either. Or do you want to take a look?”

The Nether Slaughter Saint Sovereign’s face changed when he saw Lin Yun’s smile. He had no idea how to refute those words. Ultimately, he sighed, “What do you want, then?”

Lin Yun didn’t waste any words with him, coldly said, “What do I want? Zhang Yue should suffer what I suffered back then!”
