Chapter 1511 - Seven Demonic Sects Gathered

The Heavenly Astral Pavilion had a huge harvest in this herbal field, but most of the good stuff was in the hands of the top five ranking envoys. Some were blatantly snatched away, while some were taken under the disguise of ‘safekeeping.’

This was comforting to Chen Xiuhai because at least this meant that he wasn’t the only unfortunate one. But he would rather not have that comfort because the Origin Dragon Fruit was too important to him.

When everyone was done resting, they continued their journey. They passed through three grey fog regions but smoothly made it through. It wasn't very pleasant for the five body-refining cultivators. More accurately speaking, only four because Jin Ao was far from everyone else.

When they reached the fourth grey-fogged region, Huang Kun was the first to collapse when a Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse destroyed his Flame Dragon Saint Armor. Ten-odd Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses were like hyenas pouncing forth to devour their vitality when the saint armor was damaged.

This scene made everyone feel a chill run down their spine. But it was a feast for the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, and everyone’s attention was attracted by this scene, with their faces drastically changing.

This was too cruel, and Ding Lei’s face turned terrifyingly pale because he felt he was next. Chen Xiuhai’s face aged even more, and he noticed someone touching his hand. Before he could react, a fruit appeared in his hand.

When Chen Xiuhai lowered his head, he nearly exclaimed because it was an Origin Dragon Fruit. He turned his head over to see Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was calm as he looked at Huang Kun’s corpse.

Chen Xiuhai instantly knew what he meant and sneaked a peek at the envoys ranked in the top five before his gaze fell onto Huang Kun’s corpse. He quickly stowed the Origin Dragon Fruit in his interspatial pouch, but couldn’t conceal the excitement on his face.

“Brother Lin, thanks for this.” Chen Xiuhai thanked before he fell into hesitation. “When did you get it?”

If he remembered correctly, there was another Origin Dragon Fruit. But that Origin Dragon Fruit was surrounded by crimson vortexes, and even he didn’t dare to take the risk, not to mention retrieving it under the eyes of the five envoys.

“I have my own means.” Lin Yun didn’t explain much. It was easy to deceive the eyes of others. Other than Tian Jue, who was a little difficult, others only had to be briefly distracted, and Lin Yun could silently retrieve that saint fruit.

Chen Xiuhai was alarmed when he heard what Lin Yun said, and he instantly knew that Lin Yun wasn’t simple. Moreover, Lin Yun probably wasn’t joking when he said he wanted a Divine Dragon Bone.

“B-But I don’t have any saint fruit to exchange for it.”

“Don’t bother about it. I have a saint physique, to begin with. So it’s not that effective for me.” Lin Yun said. He was helping because he wanted to, and he wasn’t looking for anything in return from Chen Xiuhai.

“Elder Chen, doesn’t it feel weird? The Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses don’t seem to have gotten any stronger after devouring our vitality… so where does all the vitality go?” Lin Yun soon changed the topic.

“Is it weird?” Chen Xiuhai had no idea what Lin Yun meant and didn’t find a problem anywhere. As he spoke, Huang Kun’s vitality was utterly devoured, and he was soon turned into a dried corpse.

But Tian Jue had no intention of stopping here, since he had a strong goal. He seemed to know where the Divine Dragon Bone was located. So he didn’t detour at all.

After they passed through the grey fog, a boundless dragon aura poured forth, making everyone rejoice. As their vision opened up, they saw a majestic mountain with an azure palace at the top of it.

The palace was emitting an ancient aura, along with a majestic dragon aura that struck everyone’s souls. The second envoy had joy in his eyes, and he exclaimed, “It’s actually the legendary Azure Dragon Palace! This is rare. The Divine Dragon Bones must be inside!”

Tian Jue’s eyes flickered, and he said, “It’s actually the Blue Dragon Palace. I thought that the legend was fake.”

“I heard that before the Golden Era ended, there was a powerful sect, the Dragon Gate, governing the seven divine dragon palaces. The Blue Dragon was the sovereign of the seven divine dragons. I heard the nine emperors received the inheritances from the Dragon Gate three thousand years ago!”

“There’s such a legend, but the Divine Dragon Empire refused to admit it, and it’s a taboo. So no one knows of the truth.”

“No matter what, there must be Divine Dragon Bones here!” The envoys were excited, and they revealed a lot of secrets that made Lin Yun surprised.

Right then, a roar echoed from the Blue Dragon Palace, and it didn’t sound like the roar of a demonic beast or a Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse. The roar was peculiar, and it made everyone’s scalps go numb.

The sound alone made many people have a trace of blood dripping down their lips as their feet began to tremble.

“What’s that?” Lin Yun’s face became grave.

Only then did everyone notice that the entire mountain was enveloped in a grey fog, aside from the summit, and the roar came from there.

“Let’s go!” Tian Jue ordered everyone towards the Blue Dragon Palace. The Blue Dragon Palace looked close, but it was a few thousand miles away, and no one dared to fly.

It took them half a day before they made it over, and they discovered that many people have already gathered at the foot of the mountain. Seeing that the experts of the other demonic sects safely made it over, Tian Jue ordered everyone to rest.

“This is troublesome…” An Liuyan whispered beside Lin Yun.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“The chief disciples of the other demonic sects are here, and you’ll have to face them if you want to compete for the Divine Dragon Bone.” An Liuyan nervously looked around.

“Who are they? Introduce them to me.” Lin Yun replied.

An Liuyan nodded, and her eyes flashed with fear when she looked at the east. “See that black-clothed person? His name is Chen Kui, and he is thirty-three this year. He’s the chief disciple of the Hundred Ghost Gate, with cultivation at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He can make it into the top seven-hundredth on the Elysium Core Ranking.”

That meant that this person was even stronger than Ku Ying at such a young age, and he couldn’t look down on someone like that. Those ranked in the top thousandths on the Elysium Core Ranking were practically seniors, but there were also exceptions for heaven-defying geniuses, and Chen Kui was such a genius.

Or rather, the chief disciples of the seven demonic sects were such monstrous geniuses, and Lin Yun wouldn’t believe it if he hadn’t fought with Xie Feng. After fighting with Xie Feng, it was hard for Lin Yun not to believe those words.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A few thousand meters to the east, there were a group of people, and Chen Kui had a pale face. But when he swept his gaze over, everyone could feel a chill run down their spines.

An Liuyan quickly looked away and looked at another person in the same direction, “That person is Yan Xuan. He’s the same age as Chen Kui, and is also ranked in the seven-hundredth on the Elysium Core Ranking. They’re evenly matched, and he’s the chief disciple of the Demonfiend Sect. He cultivated the Ancient Demonfiend Art, and he’s brutal with his Blood Demonfiend Blade.”

Lin Yun merely sent a brief glance at Yan Xuan. The chief disciples of the demonic sects were similar to the chiefs of the Earth Ranking in the Sword Sect, but there was a vast difference between the two cultivations. Then again, there was also a significant gap in terms of age because these people were a decade older than Jin Xuanyi and the others.

If Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were willing to stay in the Elysium Core Realm for another decade, they would definitely be able to reach the eight-star or even nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He could only say that the Elysium Core Realm chief disciples of the Sword Sect hadn’t fully grown out.

“The two other forces are the Blood Rain Pavilion and Seven Absolute Palace. Their chief disciples are called Qin Yue and Pei An. They’re relatively close to each other, and they’re on good terms with each other. As for their strength, they weren’t any weaker than the two I previously introduced.” An Liuyan introduced everyone there, and five of the demonic sects were gathered here, aside from the Netherworld Hall and Blood Moon Sect.

He now knew why no one dared to act recklessly. The Netherworld Hall and Blood Moon Sect were the strongest amongst the seven demonic sects, and no one would recklessly enter the grey fog before the two demonic sects.

It didn’t take long for a group of cultivators to arrive, and the person leading the party was a man donned in purple clothes, emitting an extraordinary temperament. When Lin Yun’s gaze fell on this person, he instantly recognized which demonic sect he was from, judging from the Netherworld Hall emblem on his clothes.

“Murong Chen, you’re finally here.” Chen Kui of the Hundred Ghost Gate said with his eyes shining brightly. His words drew the other chief disciples' attention, and they all released their powerful auras.

This purple-clothed man was Netherworld Hall’s chief disciple of the Elysium Core Realm, Murong Chen. His cultivation had also reached a terrifying height of nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and he seemed younger than everyone there, with a rough appearance of twenty-five.

He was an influential figure in the Eastern Desolation’s Demon Domain, and many people said that he would enter the Imperial Demon Domain once he reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, possessing the qualification to compete for the title of Eastern Desolate Holy Son.

“You’re all waiting for me instead of going after the Divine Blue Dragon Bone? It looks like this mountain is really weird, then…” Murong Chen smiled, capturing everyone’s expression in his eyes.

“The fog this time isn’t the same. If Brother Murong looks down on us, you can go ahead on your own.” Qin Yue of the Blood Rain Pavilion coldly smiled. He could naturally hear that Murong Chen was mocking them for being cowardly.

Murong Chen didn’t say a word. He might be arrogant, but he wasn’t stupid.

Lin Yun swept his gaze through the Netherworld Hall’s party and let out a breath of relief when he didn’t see Xie Feng amongst them. It would be troublesome if Xie Feng were here.

Right then, the strange roar echoed from the mountain, making everyone’s faces change. At such a close distance, some people fell to the ground due to pure fear. It was completely different from the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses they previously ran into.

“What the hell is this?” Someone spoke out in a trembling voice beside Murong Chen.

Murong Chen’s expression became grave when he heard that roar and dismissed the idea of climbing the mountain alone.

When a crimson light shone, one person after another walked out, and the one leading the party was donned in crimson clothes with a jade belt. He had an extraordinary appearance and was the Blood Moon Sect’s chief disciple of the Elysium Core Realm, Ling Qianye.

With that, the chief disciples of the seven demonic sects have gathered together.
