Chapter 684 - Transcending Realm to Kill

A terrifying dragon roar soared into the sky as a violent aura began to rumble on Lin Yun’s body. He didn’t bother concealing the torrential aura he was giving off. This instantly caught everyone’s attention, bringing fear to their faces. The violent aura was too terrifying, which gave everyone the feeling that a terrifying demonic beast had made a breakthrough.

“What a violent aura! Did a demonic beast make a breakthrough?”

“A demonic beast this terrifying is actually at the border of Flamedragon Hill? How is this possible...such a violent aura is rare even in the depths of Flamedragon Hill.”

“Perhaps it’s a treasure that attracted a demonic beast from the depths of the hill.”

“Go, let’s go and take a look!” Many people’s eyes lit up as the violent aura had clearly attracted many people’s attention. Even if Lin Yun had encountered such a phenomenon, he also wouldn’t be able to contain the curiosity in his heart.

Many people were standing on the hill, wearing the Ironblood Sword Gate’s uniform. The one leading the party was Tang Ying. He was sure that the heavily injured Lin Yun should be in the Flamedragon Hill, but he couldn’t find Lin Yun anywhere.

Last night, they were heavily attacked by the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture and were chased out from the depths of Flamedragon Hill. Tang Ying was currently feeling vexed and this aura had attracted his attention.

“What a powerful aura…” An Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciple was shocked by the aura.

“It’s him?” Tang Ying’s eyes flashed as he could sense a familiar aura from the outburst. Shortly after, his eyes flashed coldly as he barked, “Follow me!”

Releasing his aura in the greater Yin-Yang stage, he spread his arms apart and shot out like a bolt of lightning, relying on his powerful cultivation to travel quickly. It didn’t take long for him to see an azure figure seated on the empty ground.

Tang Ying was briefly stunned before his eyes exploded with hatred. It was this brat that made him suffer being stomped by Murong Qing three times. The humiliation was beyond description. It was so bad that he wanted to skin Lin Yun alive even in his dreams.

“It’s you!” A murderous roar echoed out in the forest that startled the cultivators who were coming over. The killing aura from Tang Ying was empowered by his cultivation in the greater Yin-Yang stage, which spanned a thousand meters.

“Isn’t that the Ironblood Sword Gate’s vice-sect master?”

“What is he doing here? What a terrifying aura. Just what is that young man doing?”

“What he’s doing doesn’t matter. But based on Tang Ying’s expression, this young man is going to die.” Although they didn’t know about the matter between Tang Ying and Lin Yun, the faces of the spectators changed.

The Ironblood Sword Gate was an overlord in Flamedragon Hill. Unless a clan from the Skymound City came, no one dared to offend them here. But that young man actually provoked the vice-sect master of Ironblood Sword Gate to personally intervene.

Tang Ying’s killing aura surged violently in the forest as he glared at Lin Yun like a wild beast, hoping to tear him apart.

“You’re really high profile. Do you know how bitter it was looking for you?” Tang Ying smiled eerily with a cold light flashing in his pupils.

Lin Yun was still seated on the ground as he said, “I’ve also been waiting for you for a long time.”

Tang Ying sneered and unleashed his killing aura. He had completely ignored Lin Yun’s words. After all, Lin Yun’s cultivation was akin to an ant in his eyes.

Just yesterday he could easily suppress this brat. So under his rage, Lin Yun would die even more terribly. Right at this moment, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples began to appear. They weren’t as fast as Tang Ying, which is why they arrived late. Looking at this scene, their faces were even more shocked.

“Why are you waiting for me? You think you can do anything with your pitiful cultivation?” Tang Ying said with a ridiculing and disdainful tone.

“I’m sending you to your death!” Lin Yun stood up and a torrential killing aura exploded out from his body.

But when the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples heard him, they began to laugh. A middle-aged man came out from the crowd of disciples as he sneered, “Vice-Sect Master, let me face this brat. I was only injured because I was caught by surprise.”

“Permitted,” said Tang Ying emotionally.

“You’re not qualified to fight me,” said Lin Yun as he glanced at the middle-aged man who previously coveted his Flamedragon Fruit. If it wasn’t for this person, he wouldn’t be in so much trouble.

“What arrogance!” The middle-aged man’s face turned pale. He was in the lesser Yin-Yang stage and he was an elder of the Ironblood Sword Gate. But Lin Yun said he wasn’t qualified?

The middle-aged man charged forward and aimed his hand at Lin Yun’s forehead.

Looking at the middle-aged man, Lin Yun snorted and slapped him, “You’re courting death!”

No one could see how Lin Yun attacked. They could only hear a slap before the middle-aged man was sent flying away. Looking at the middle-aged man, Lin Yun stomped his foot down and crushed the middle-aged man’s ribs, “I told you that you’re not qualified. I’ve defeated many people in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. So who do you think you are?!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The middle-aged man yelled out from the pain with his face turning pale as he nearly fainted.

“Stop!” Tang Ying’s face changed upon seeing this scene. But Lin Yun’s eyes flash coldly as he circulated the azure dragon energy in his foot. When his foot hit the ground, the middle-aged man was turned into a pile of meat. All of this happened in front of the Ironblood Sword Gate’s men.

This made everyone suck in a deep breath as they couldn't believe that Lin Yun just killed an elder from the Ironblood Sword Gate. He even did this in front of Tang Ying. It was only now that they realized how terrifying this young man was.

“You’re courting death!” Tang Ying flew into a rage as he charged towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun wasn’t afraid to face Tang Yin and he took a step forward with the azure dragon energy coursing through his body. Clenching his fist, he diverted a dragon rune into his fist and threw a punch.

When the fist and palm collided, everything within a thousand meter radius was reduced to ashes. This scene left everyone shocked as they couldn’t believe that this youth could fight Tang Ying evenly. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s fist was glowing even brighter and sent Tang Ying flying away.

“This is impossible!” Although he wasn’t genuinely injured, Tang Ying was still shocked beyond words. After all, how could a brat in the greater Yang stage push him back?

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s blood began to boil. He had undergone a complete transformation with the Azure Dragon Enneaform reaching the fourth stage. He had only needed three dragon runes to push Tang Ying away.

“I told you that I’ve been waiting for you.” As Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered in the wind, a violent aura surged from his body.

“Vice-Sect Master!” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples yelled. The disdain in their eyes had disappeared and was replaced with boundless fear.

Tang Ying’s face was ugly as he looked at Lin Yun coldly. A terrifying aura exploded from his body. He had completely unleashed his aura. The faces of the cultivators became grave because they knew that Tang Ying was getting serious.

It really wasn’t easy for a young man in the Yang stage to force Tang Ying to bring out his true strength. This would be a rare scene in Skymound City, not to mention Flamedragon Hill.

After all, there was a huge difference between the lesser and greater Yin-Yang stage. The latter could easily suppress the former and there wouldn’t be any pressure even if they faced ten enemies. Now that Tang Ying was genuinely enraged, he gave off a feeling of an ancient demonic beast.

Tang Ying’s face was pale as he looked at Lin Yun coldly, “I’ll let you know the power of the greater Yin-Yang stage!”

His eyes flashed brightly as a crimson glow began to envelop his body. But Lin Yun had faced it calmly because he already had the strength to fight Tang Ying previously. He was confident of escaping even if he couldn’t defeat Tang Ying back then. Back then, if he wasn’t afraid of the Heavenly Soul Realm expert, this old man would not be in any position to be arrogant.

Now that his Azure Dragon Enneaform had reached the fourth stage, there was nothing Lin Yun had to be afraid of with the great boost in his strength. Who says that someone in the Yang stage couldn’t kill someone in the greater Yin-Yang stage?

Today, he was here to suppress Tang Ying. Tang Ying had to die!
