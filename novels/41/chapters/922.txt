Chapter 923 - Azure Dragon Ranking, Yuan Hengtian!

Three days had passed, but Flamefeather City was still buzzing with excitement. The Glorysun Spirit might have been taken by Lin Yun, but the city still had many things to offer. In fact, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong were still trying their luck.

Both of them knew that Lin Yun had a huge harvest in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion and that the value of his harvest far exceeded the sealed Glorysun Spirit. This was especially true of the Millennium Flame that could easily shake the Azure Dragon Region.

However, Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong kept this secret to themselves. They were afraid of Lin Yun and they also wanted to look for treasures. If they leaked the details, it would bring them trouble and attention.

After three days passed, both of them had a nasty expression on their faces. Majority of the regions had already been searched and those that were still intact were filled with danger. They found a few things after taking some risks, but nothing could compare to what Lin Yun obtained from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.

“We can’t stay here anymore,” sighed Xian Yunzhen with disappointment on his face. Chen Qiong’s expression wasn’t any better. They were full of disappointment because of the treasures that they had seen. If only they were faster back then, the Millennium Flame, the divine astral pellets, and the advanced fortune martial techniques would be theirs.

It was a painful memory to recall. They had nothing and it was all because of that despicable cat!

“We won’t be able to bear the fire poison if we stay any longer,” said Chen Qiong. He didn’t want to waste any more time here because he also had to rush to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm had countless treasures and many inheritances. Furthermore, their harvest in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm would determine their final ranking.

If one was unlucky, they might receive nothing in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. However, with enough luck, they might soar into the sky if they found a complete inheritance.

“Look there!” Xian Yunzhen’s face changed with deep fear all of a sudden.

“What’s wrong?” Chen Qiong turned his head in confusion before his face changed drastically too. He saw three black-clothed youths approaching the city. Each of them emitted a terrifying aura like a violent volcano and they were all in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm!

“T-that’s the Bloodbone Realm. They came so quickly!” Chen Qiong was shocked by how quickly the Bloodbone Realm responded. Feng Wuji was killed three days ago and the Bloodbone Realm’s elites were already here.

“That’s not it,” said Xian Yunzhen with a grave expression. Then, he pointed at the black-clothed youth leading the party. The Blackflame Realm and Nethercloud Realm’s foundations couldn’t be compared to the Bloodbone Realm. So it wasn’t surprising that they came so quickly.

“Yuan Hengtian!” Chen Qiong was stunned as he gasped. The leader was Yuan Hengtian who was ranked 97 on the Azure Dragon Ranking. It was unbelievable that Feng Wuji’s death attracted the attention of an expert from the Azure Dragon Ranking.

There were thousands of realms in the Azure Dragon Region with no less than a million cultivators. However, only the top 100 would make it into the Azure Dragon Ranking. So the Azure Dragon Ranking belonged to the peerless geniuses.

The basic requirement of making the ranking was to be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. However, that alone wasn’t enough to make the ranking.

“Looks like the Bloodbone Realm is serious about killing Lin Yun. They even sent a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking.” Chen Qiong couldn’t describe the shock he was feeling right now.

“Let’s go take a look.” Xian Yunzhen’s eyes flashed as he decided to take a look. The Bloodbone Realm might be terrifying, but they couldn’t commit any unnecessary murders against those from the higher realms.

Many other people also noticed the arrival of the Bloodbone Realm. The cultivators from the higher realms instantly dropped what they were doing and ran over to Yuan Hengtian.Some realms had a good relationship with the Bloodbone Realm, so a few people stepped forward to share information about what happened.

“Yuan Hengtian is actually here! He’s one of the strongest geniuses from the Bloodbone Realm!”

“It looks like the Bloodbone Realm is determined to get the Glorysun Spirit. I bet they’re worried that the other higher realms might get to Lin Yun first.”

“Lin Yun is finished!” No one had any hopes for Lin Yun anymore.

It didn’t take long for Yuan Hengtian’s party to arrive at Feng Wuji’s corpse. Due to the blazing temperature in the Flamefeather City, Feng Wuji’s corpse had been reduced to bones. After all, Lin Yun’s sword severed Feng Wuji of all vitality.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yuan Hengtian reached out and summoned Feng Wuji’s skull. When everyone saw the skull, they felt conflicted. After all, they could still recall how breathtaking Lin Yun’s sword was.

Casually crushing the skull with his hand, black miasma surged out with a crimson glow. It turned out that Feng Wuji’s ill will remained even after three days.

Preserving the ill will in a jade slip, Yuan Hengtian shut his eyes in silence. His companions didn’t utter a word because they knew that Yuan Hengtian was trying to locate Lin Yun.

A brief moment later, Yuan Hengtian opened his eyes and said, “That fellow ran really far away. But no matter where he goes, he can’t escape me!”

“Big Brother Yuan, Lin Yun is so arrogant. He claimed that he only needed one sword to kill us,” said a nearby cultivator. None of the higher realm cultivators had a favorable impression of Lin Yun, so they were happy to feed the fire. They wanted Lin Yun to feel despair.

“Don’t worry. I won’t let him off,” said Yuan Hengtian coldly. “An ant from the lower realm dares to stand against my Bloodbone Realm? I’ll make him suffer an ending worse than death!”

The Heavenly Path was a competition between more than 10,000 realms. Knowing this, it wasn’t necessarily easy for a higher realm to stand out.

However, this didn’t apply to the Bloodbone Realm. They were infamous even among the higher realms. They were infamous for their massacres and annihilation of other higher realms.

So it was easy to imagine the kind of uproar that Lin Yun caused by killing Feng Wuji. Rumors spread throughout every corner of the Azure Dragon Region.

All of the rumors marked Lin Yun as an arrogant person who couldn’t be cleansed. When the Bloodbone Realm leaked the news that they had sent Yuan Hengtian out, no one could believe what was happening.

Many people were betting on how long Lin Yun could survive before getting killed. After all, there was no way Lin Yun would survive until the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

It was unprecedented for anyone in the lower realm to live after offending the higher realms, not to mention three higher realms.

But Lin Yun had no idea about the rumors. He was peacefully seated on a mountain with ten divine astral pellets around him. The divine astral pellets were blazing with golden flames as boundless astral energy poured out of them.

Lin Yun was busy circulating his sword sutras to absorb the astral energy. Furthermore, he was also refining the astral flames to temper his body.

After doing this for quite some time, he opened his eyes in excitement. The divine astral pellets were a lot stronger than he had imagined. There was no doubt that the difference between divine astral pellets and astral pellets were like heaven and earth.
