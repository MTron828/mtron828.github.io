Chapter 1885 - Undercurrent

There was a spacious plaza before the altar named the Chess Daofield. The ground was similar to a chessboard, and saints usually held their lectures there for saint disciples. But since today was the conferring ceremony, there weren’t any restrictions, and many people were gathered there.

Generally speaking, the one hosting the conferring ceremony was a Saint Elder. Saint Elders were rarely seen, even within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and each held a noble status. Lin Yun came last because the newly promoted saint disciples from the hundred and eight peaks were already gathered there.

“Senior Brother, what you did at the Nether Orchid Courtyard has long spread out, and many people aren’t happy with you confessing to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. Keep a low profile if someone comes after you later during the conferring ceremony. I’m afraid that many people might be coming after you…” Chen Feng said with a nervous tone.

He was pretty confident about Ye Qingtian’s strength, but his senior brother was too arrogant and easily provoked others. That was especially when what happened at the Nether Orchid Courtyard spread out. Many people would come to the Indigo Thunder Peak every day, wanting to challenge him, and some even suggested a death match. Amongst those people who came, there were Bai Shuying’s pursuers, and there were also those who couldn’t stand Ye Qingtian’s arrogance.

But the Indigo Thunder Peak dealt with their challenges, and they didn’t even tell Lin Yun about them, fearing that it might disrupt Ye Qingtian’s cultivation. Upon hearing that, Lin Yun had disdain on his face, but he still nodded with incredible difficulty.

Since they were all newly conferred saint disciples, their cultivation would only be at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage, at best, which was already the limit. According to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s rules, the conferring ceremony was held once every year, and anyone who could reach the Profound Death Stage could be conferred.

So unless it was those disciples who didn’t come back for a few years, the highest one could reach within a year was only the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage. But generally speaking, it was already impressive if one could reach the third channel of the Profound Death Stage.

Based on his means, if he used the Myriad Scales Armor, Black Tortoise Chains, and the Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, he wouldn’t even fear facing enemies at the Nirvana Stage, not to mention the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage. Even if he didn’t use any treasures, he wouldn’t fear facing someone at the pinnacle seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage.

So he only felt bored now and hoped that the conferring ceremony could end quickly. No matter how much Chen Feng praised the conferring ceremony, Lin Yun was not interested in it. A battle of this level could never be compared to the intense battles he had experienced at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden!” Chen Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Senior Brother, the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples, and Nether Orchid Holy Maiden are here!”

Lin Yun raised his eyes and looked in Bai Shuying’s direction. She was as beautiful as always. She had smooth and jade-like skin, but she had a sharp temperament. Her appearance wasn’t exceptionally beautiful, but she had a unique temperament. Her beauty wasn’t breathtaking, but she looked serene and exquisite.

To a certain degree, someone like her could easily attract the attention of men. The moment she appeared, she instantly became the center of attention, with countless gazes on her.

“Ye Qingtian, I thought a coward like you wouldn’t come to the conferring ceremony.” A cold roar echoed as Luo Cheng walked over with a cold face.

“Oh,” Lin Yun replied.

Hearing Lin Yun’s half-hearted reply, Luo Cheng’s pupils coldly flashed. “The conferring ceremony hasn’t started yet. Why don’t we have some fun and determine the winner between us in ten moves? Whoever loses will give up becoming a saint disciple. What do you think?”

Luo Cheng’s words echoed across the plaza, instantly attracting everyone’s attention, including those on the Chess Daofield.

“Someone finally stood out to challenge Ye Qingtian.”

“I was wondering if the saint disciples were all scared to challenge him this time.”

“A piece of trash like Ye Qingtian shouldn’t appear within the conferring ceremony.”

“He’s just a lecher. How can someone like him possess the qualifications to become a saint disciple? He’s the shame of the Heavenly Dao Sect!”

“I heard he went into hiding after causing an uproar at the Nether Orchid Courtyard for half a month.”

Amidst the surrounding discussions, everyone turned their attention over. But Lin Yun merely scoffed and didn’t even bother with Luo Cheng.

“Ye Qingtian, you have already cowered for half a month. Are you still planning to cower?” Luo Cheng roared, not wanting to let Lin Yun off.

I cowered for half a month? Why didn’t I know about that? Lin Yun turned to look at Chen Feng. Chen Feng whispered to Lin Yun and told him what had happened over the past half a month, and Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling. He nearly forgot what he did at the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

“It’s not easy for the Nether Orchid Courtyard to produce a saint disciple, and I have no interest in you. So get lost.” Lin Yun wasn’t polite to Luo Cheng with his words.

His words naturally caused an uproar, and even Luo Cheng’s lips twitched when he heard that. This was because what Lin Yun said was the other way around. It should be hard for the Indigo Thunder Peak to produce a saint disciple. As for others, they were surprised because Ye Qingtian showed no intention of lowering his head and was even more arrogant.

“Ha,” Luo Cheng scoffed. “Ye Qingtian, where did you get your face from? My Nether Orchid Courtyard produces at least ten saint disciples every year, and it has been many years since your Indigo Thunder Peak has produced any saint disciples.”

“Then, where did you get the face from to challenge me? You can’t even take two attacks from me and still want to determine a winner between us within ten moves?” Lin Yun laughed.

Having his embarrassing deed exposed, Luo Cheng lost himself to his anger. “I was careless back then. Come and fight me again, if you have the guts!”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Get lost. I have no interest in a loser like you. If not because I’m afraid Senior Sister Bai might be heartbroken, do you think I’ll waste my saliva talking to you?” Lin Yun replied.

The face of Bai Shuying, who was walking to her seat, became cold upon hearing what Lin Yun said, and she barked, “Luo Cheng, come back!”

“See? Senior Sister Bai is afraid I’ll injure you, and it’ll be hard for the Indigo Thunder Peak and Nether Orchid Courtyard to interact in the future,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Bullshit. You’re a lecher, and there’s no way my Senior Sister will fall for someone like you.” Luo Cheng couldn’t hold it because Bai Shuying had a special status within the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Not only was she the holy maiden, she was even the dream lover of all the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples. This was why Luo Cheng couldn’t contain himself when Lin Yun mentioned her.

“Who knows? How can someone like you possibly understand the rapport between us?” Lin Yun smiled.

Right then, a sword ray flew over. But Lin Yun quickly reacted and managed to dodge the attack at the price of having several strands of his hair severed. The boundless sword aura also forced Lin Yun back three steps before he regained his footing. When he raised his head, he saw that the attack came from Bai Shuying, and he nearly couldn’t react in time.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ll tear your mouth apart if you speak any more nonsense here.” Bai Shuying coldly looked at Lin Yun, flashing murderous intent within her pupils.

She wasn’t a little girl who Lin Yun’s words could subdue. When she came to her senses that night, she realized Lin Yun had swapped the concept within his words. No matter what he said, it wouldn’t change the fact that he was a lecher, which was why she couldn’t contain her anger when she heard his shameless words.

After Lin Yun regained his footing, he smiled, “I’ll listen to Senior Sister. I won’t talk about our secrets in front of others.”

Lin Yun responded that he didn’t sense Bai Shuying’s anger and replied with amorous words.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Bai Shuying knew that this was a shameless person and no longer talked with him. Thus, she could only vent her anger on Luo Cheng and roared, “Luo Cheng, come back! Are you still trying to embarrass yourself?”

Luo Cheng was placed in a difficult position, but could only suck it up and return. Before he left, he glared at Lin Yun.

When everything was settled, the atmosphere became heated because everyone could sense that the conferring ceremony this year wasn’t going to be the same as usual. Not long later, the remaining people from the hundred and eight peaks and the two other courtyards came.

When the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples came, Lin Yun saw Ye Xinyan again. Unlike Bai Shuying, Lin Yun restrained his emotions for her. He knew that she had a sensitive identity, and that he couldn’t reveal his identity to her. It was best for him not to show any connection with Ye Xinyan, or it might bring trouble to her.

It was best for him to protect her in the dark and repay what he owed her. Regardless of whether it was Big Brother Xinjue’s death or that Ye Xinyan was forced to marry the crown prince because of him, he owed her a lot.

Lin Yun quickly retracted his gaze when their gazes bumped into each other. But Ye Xinyan felt an even stronger familiarity with Ye Qingtian this time, and she began to wonder about Ye Qingtian’s identity.

Lin Yun had long reached the Manifestation Stage with the Divine Tortoise Transformation. So unless he was suppressed by a saint aura or someone proficient in eye techniques, even a saint wouldn’t be able to see through his identity.

On the other hand, Ye Xinyan couldn’t figure out the doubt within her heart, no matter how she pondered it.

When the two palaces’ disciples came, the Chess Daofield became bustling, and Lin Yun could sense many ill gazes directed at him.

Outside the Chess Daofield, the other inner disciples and older saint disciples didn’t have good faces. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect was the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation, and anyone who could enter the sect were prideful. So in their eyes, someone like Ye Qingtian was the shame of the sect, so who could accept someone like him becoming a saint disciple?

As for those who were already saint disciples, they felt ashamed that someone like Ye Qingtian would be on the same level as them. As for the inner disciples, they found this ridiculous.

Let’s wait and see if you can continue to smile later! Luo Cheng glared at Lin Yun with flames blazing within his pupils. He had long heard that many people wanted to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson on the conferring ceremony and step on him. This included the disciples of the two palaces.
