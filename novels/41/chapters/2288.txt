Chapter 2289 - Moonlight Sacred Ring

The Roost End Saint Lord’s words scared many people. But they didn’t dare raise their voices when discussing the three holy lands.

In the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s faction, the one leading the party was a middle-aged woman who looked to be in her thirties. But she was a Saint Sovereign, the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign.

“Saint Sovereign, there are rumors that Lin Yun gave the divine flame fragment to Missy.” A Saint Elder came over and nervously said with excitement in his eyes.

“This is weird…” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign was cautious and had no joy on her face. The Divine Phoenix Mountain was determined to obtain the divine flame fragment since they had a stronger need for it than other holy lands. This was why they would let a Saint Sovereign take the risk and enter, but it was obtained by a junior instead.

“It’s probably true.”

“The three holy lands might have dismissed it as rumors, but they’re anxious.”

“Saint Sovereign, we should make preparations soon.”

“Yeah. What should we do about Flower Burial? If the three holy lands step forth, it’d be difficult for us to protect him,” a few Saint Elders said.

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said, “There’s no need to hurry. We will talk again after Zixi comes out.”

She had already decided that if Lin Yun gave away the divine flame fragment, she would protect him no matter what to return to favor. Aside from that, she also knew some secrets and the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Lord was interested in him.

Lin Yun didn’t know what was happening outside the God Burial Mountain Range as he headed east after leaving the Fallen God Valley. After he became a Saint, he would turn into a bright sun whenever he executed the Divine Sunchasing Art. He would look like a golden fireball from afar, streaking across the sky.

His speed was fast, but he could be faster if he rode his sword. The Flame Dragon River appeared before him after a few hours and he firmly crossed it. The river might have been an issue to him in the past, but not anymore. The Flower Burial Sword was like a raft as he crossed the magma river.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun soared to the sky, and the Flower Burial Sword returned to his heart. He muttered, “I’m four to five times faster than before. I might be able to catch up with Ji Zixi and the others.”

It was safe after crossing the Flame Dragon River, but only relatively. Six Holy City was no longer around, with Blood Crows everywhere and demonic beasts from the forbidden zones. The Divine Phoenix Mountain party was traveling alone, which was much more convenient for him.

“Should I make a trip to the Myriad Grave Valley again?” Lin Yun turned to look at the Myriad Grave Valley in deep thought. That place was a mystery and even the Iris Sword Saint had left a clone behind. Lin Yun speculated that the ancient seal in the God Burial Mountain Range was related to the Myriad Graves Valley.

“Now that the God Burial Mountain Range’s restriction is collapsing to the point that even saints could enter, I wonder if the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity had left behind any plans,” Lin Yun muttered. After witnessing the Demonspirit Clan’s preparations in the Heavenly Void, Lin Yun knew that the Demonspirit Clans would be a huge threat if they could leave the God Burial Mountain Range. He recalled what the Asura Dove King said: There are many places like the Heavenly Void in the God Burial Mountain Range.

After all, more than one deity had died on the ancient battlefield. A moment later, Lin Yun decided to join up with the Divine Phoenix Mountain party.

“I should be able to catch up, right?” Lin Yun muttered before shaking his head. He could see traces left behind by those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

A dazzling radiance appeared four hours later at the God Burial Mountain Range’s entrance.

“Heavenly Sage Saint Lord!”

“Crow Shot Saint Lord!”

“Indigo Brave Saint Lord!”

The three holy lands had exclaimed as they looked at the fear in the eyes of those from the three holy lands.

The faces of the three Saint Sovereigns changed when they saw this because they now knew that the rumors were probably true. The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign asked, “Heavenly Sage, what’s going on? Where’s the young sect master?”

“Saint Sovereign, let us return the Sovereign Saint Artifact to the Great Saint before speaking.” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord didn’t want to speak about it because it was embarrassing that Huang Jingyu was killed with one sword. It wasn’t glory and would even affect the Ming Cult’s reputation.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s face became pale as he looked at the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, who nodded. This verification made the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign stagger and nearly fall to the ground. On the other side, the Crow Shot Saint Lord also wasn’t willing to speak more.

“Let’s return the Sovereign Saint Artifact to the Great Saint first and let him handle this,” the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign said in a furious and sorrowful voice. The Sovereign Saint Artifact’s full power could only be unleashed in the hands of a Great Saint, and only a Great Saint could decide if they should move against another holy land.

The entrance of the God Burial Mountain Range soon shone once more as the Divine Phoenix Mountain party appeared, followed by Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun! Flower Burial has come out! He’s really with the Divine Phoenix Mountain?”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“So, are the rumors true about him defeating a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit in the Heavenly Void?”

“And also about him suppressing thousands of demonic corpses by himself.” When Lin Yun appeared, the entire God Burial Mountain Range became heated, with everyone discussing his feats.

Lin Yun joined up with the Divine Phoenix Mountain group, who were excited as they looked at Ji Zixi.

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign asked, “Did you guys obtain the divine flame fragment?”

Ji Zixi nodded before her eyes shone brightly as she looked at Lin Yun, “It’s all thanks to Big Brother Lin. Without him, it’s uncertain if we could even return live.”

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain became excited as they looked at Lin Yun. The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign briefly examined Lin Yun, then she smiled, “The Divine Phoenix Mountain will remember this favor.”

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing upon hearing that.

“I’ve heard that you suppressed thousands of demonic corpses by yourself and saved everyone?” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign didn’t initially believe it since it was too ridiculous.

Lin Yun briefly pondered and replied, “If you’re talking about those from the Clear Nether Sect and the others, it’s true.”

“You also defeated a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit and the Blood Moon Divine Son?” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign asked as she took a deep breath.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated before nodding. This caused an uproar, leaving everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain dumbfounded.

A long time later, the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign said, “It looks like the Radiant’s lineage has an heir.”

“Lin Yun, did you kill my Ming Cult’s Huang Jingyu?!” A roar echoed as the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign led the Ming Cult’s Saints over.

Did he kill the Ming Cult’s young sect master? Even the Astral River Saint Sovereign’s face changed once they finally knew where Lin Yun went. After all, Lin Yun left shortly after they ran into the three holy lands.

Lin Yun was fearless as he replied, “If someone wants to kill me, I will kill them.”

“How dare you! Didn’t you know the status of Huang Jingyu within the Ming Cult?!”

“There’s no need to waste time with him, let’s just cripple him.”

“Even if we can’t kill him, we can just hand him to Tian Xuanzi. He will be more than willing to act,” the Ming Cult’s Saint Elders were furious. Even if Huang Jingyu deserved to die, they had no intention of letting Lin Yun go.

“You want to take him with me around? Do you think that the Divine Phoenix Mountain doesn’t exist?” A Saint Sovereign’s aura swept out that came from the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign.

“So what? He has to pay with his life! Brat, let me ask you. Did you kill my sect’s Heavenly Kui Saint Lord?” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s party and the Heavenly Flame Sect also came forth. The three holy lands joined together, putting pressure on the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign coldly said, “Do you think the Eastern Desolation is the same as before? Your Divine Phoenix Mountain relied on your ability to obtain the divine flame fragment, but I advise you to step back if you want to protect that brat.”

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign sneered, “Back when the Heavenly Dao Sect ruled the Eastern Desolation, even they didn’t dare to say such words to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Don’t even dream about taking Lin Yun away. Anyone who dares to touch him will become enemies of my Divine Phoenix Mountain!”

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign was decisive and made up her mind after verifying that the divine flame fragment came from Lin Yun.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign snorted and released his aura, causing space to collapse. “You can’t protect him. Come here!”

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign suddenly made a move towards Lin Yun. With a wave of his hand, the surrounding space around Lin Yun became restricted and he was being pulled over.

Even though Lin Yun was caught up in that and couldn’t control his body, in the critical moment, he raised his hand and activated the Moonlight Sacred Ring, “Destroy!”

Moonlight shone out as the full power of the Moonlight Sacred Ring was unleashed.

“The Moonlight Sacred Ring?!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign nearly threw out a mouthful of blood when he saw this scene.
