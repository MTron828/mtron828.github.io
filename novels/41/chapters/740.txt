Chapter 741 - Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy

The old man didn’t move throughout the entire ordeal, but his aura had intimidated many demonic beasts. Releasing his aura alone was better than killing hundreds of demonic beasts. Otherwise, the pressure would be greater on everyone else.

The pressure was like an invisible wall blocking many demonic beasts. The weaker demonic beasts would be immobilized if they dared to come near his aura. This was why he couldn’t move from his spot, so he could only let Lin Yun and Long Hao to assist the north gate. He had keen eyes and he could tell that those two could defeat a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast together.

Long Hao followed behind Lin Yun and observed his movement technique. The movement technique that Lin Yun was using wasn’t powerful, but he had reached high attainment in it. It might be fast, but it was still flawed in Long Hao’s eyes as a powerful movement technique wouldn’t exhaust much origin energy upon use.

Suddenly, Lin Yun came to a stop and Long Hao said, “We’re still not there yet.”

“Why are you following me?” Lin Yun turned around and looked at Long Hao with a cold gaze.

The sudden questioning made Long Hao panic a little before he smiled, “That quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert wants us to deal with it together. Why are you questioning me following you?”

“That’s not what I meant.” That old man’s words were only an excuse because Long Hao had approached him on purpose. If Long Hao dared to pretend to be confused before him, then he would leave Long Hao confused for the rest of his lifetime.

Retracting his smile, Long Hao said, “You’re a swordsman with keen sword intent. So you should be able to sense that I have no ill intentions. Otherwise, I would’ve already stabbed you with my sword.”

“I don’t like being followed by strangers,” replied Lin Yun.

Spreading his arms apart, Long Hao smiled, “I’m afraid you have to put up with it, at least until we kill the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.”

“Are you from Swordmire City?” Lin Yun’s gaze suddenly became sharp as he looked at Long Hao.

“I guess so.” Long Hao smiled before he continued, “I’ll tell you more after we deal with that quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.”

Lin Yun glanced at this person and didn’t say anything else. The north gate still required assistance and this wasn’t the time to deal with Long Hao. A few minutes later, they arrived at the north gate.

The situation wasn’t great. The ground was littered with corpses that the demonic beasts chomped on. When Lin Yun and Long Hao landed on the ground, they drew their swords and killed all the demonic beasts, saving the Profound Martial Realm cultivators.

“Quick, help Big Brother Chen!” The Profound Martial Realm cultivators who were saved weren't relieved. On the contrary, they were extremely anxious.

There are Violet Palace Realm cultivators still alive? Lin Yun and Long Hao exchanged a glance before they charged towards the frontline.

Along the way, a Yin-Yang stage demonic beast charged over at Lin Yun, but Lin Yun severed it in half with a single slash. Soon, they reached the frontline where a middle-aged Yin-Yang stage expert stood with one severed arm. However, he was still resisting the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast’s advance. It was easy for him to leave with his cultivation, but there were still cultivators in this world who were willing to give their lives for others.

“We’re lucky that it’s an ordinary quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.” Long Hao glanced at the colossal hound with spikes covering its back. It might be an ordinary demonic beast, but it was a lot stronger than usual under the ominous aura’s influence.

Long Hao fell into deep thoughts because this battle wouldn’t be easy. But while he was thinking, Lin Yun slashed his sword without hesitation. Lin Yun soared into the sky with his azure clothes fluttering in the wind as his sword intent rained down like the reflection of a moon on a lake.

When Lin Yun’s attack landed on the demonic beast, he managed to break dozens of spikes before the demonic beast went flying. When he landed beside the middle-aged man, he looked at the now bloody hound and said, “You should retreat first.”

“Young Master Lin, this demonic beast isn’t easy to deal with…” The middle-aged man was gasping for air and was worried for Lin Yun. But before he could finish his sentence, Lin Yun sent him flying with a palm to his chest. While the man flew through the air, Lin Yun flicked his finger and sent a pellet into the middle-aged man’s mouth.

This was a pretty precious pellet as all of Lin Yun’s pellets came from the secret realms that he visited. When the pellet entered the middle-aged man’s mouth, he instantly recovered about 50% of his injuries and he could even feel the improvement of his cultivation.

This left the middle-aged man speechless because he knew that Lin Yun wasn’t simple. Even more shocking was that Lin Yun could give such a precious pellet away so easily.

The demonic beast took advantage of this moment and shot out the spikes out of its back with flames. When the bone spikes flew out, the demonic beast’s size had shrunk. Clearly, this attack greatly exhausted the demonic beast.

Facing this attack, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless and slashed out his sword, reducing the bone spikes coming at him into dust. Lin Yun was cautious because he knew that the bone spikes were powerful. This scene made the demonic beast’s eyes light up as it pounced over at Lin Yun while he was busy dealing with the bone spikes.

The demonic beast was coming at Lin Yun from a tricky trajectory. But before Lin Yun could react, a sword ray sent the demonic beast flying back as Long Hao landed on the ground and smiled, “It’s ultimately a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. It's still somewhat troublesome.”

“Whether or not you are here, it’s not bad for me,” replied Lin Yun.

“What?” Long Hao instantly became depressed because Lin Yun was indirectly saying that he was in the way. He turned to smile at Lin Yun before charging towards the demonic beast, “Looks like I’m being underestimated...then there’s no need for me to hold back then.”

“Nightluster Slash!” Long Hao roared as his xiantian sword intent gushed out, forming a sword ray that slashed the demonic beast. His attack sent the hound flying out with a gash of half a meter on its body.

Lin Yun was also surprised by this attack. Although Long Hao had the advantage of his age, this attack was still pretty powerful, especially as the sword technique vaguely showed traces of an ancient sword technique.

Long Hao turned around to see Lin Yun’s reaction, but Lin Yun was calm. This made Long Hao smile bitterly as he wanted to show off in front of Lin Yun, “This brat…”

The demonic beast was unfortunate to run into Long Hao and Lin Yun. Furthermore, the attacks of these were powerful enough to crush the demonic beast completely. Even its precious beast core was broken into fragments under their attacks. With the death of the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast, the remaining demonic beasts were easier to deal with.

“I’m not going to hide it from you anymore. I’m an Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy, responsible for finding talented swordsmen for the Sword Alliance. I am indeed from Swordmire City as it’s the headquarters for the Sword Alliance,” said Long Hao after they were done cleaning up.

He noticed that Lin Yun was a decisive person and Lin Yun wouldn’t bother with him if he continued to hide anything.

“Sword Alliance?” Lin Yun asked in doubt.

“You don’t have to know what the Sword Alliance is. Those in the Sword Alliance aren’t forbidden from joining sects and it’s a loose organization to service swordsmen,” smiled Long Hao.

“Not interested,” said Lin Yun.

“No rush. I’m confident that you’ll be interested as you’re a genuine swordsman. You won’t give up this chance to become strong. My sword intent is because of the Sword Alliance and there are also many martial techniques up for exchange,” said Long Hao patiently. He realized that he might’ve found a jade this time.

Right at this moment, a resounding beast roar echoed out along with black mist that rose to the sky and instantly spread over a few thousand meters. Looking at this scene, Long Hao’s eyes turned dark before he sighed, “Looks like we won’t be able to protect the city anymore.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
