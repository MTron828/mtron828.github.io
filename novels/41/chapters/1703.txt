Chapter 1704 – Blood Dragon Scripture

As thunder continued to rumble in the sky, Xu Dongfei took several steps back before stabilizing himself. This scene shocked everyone because they didn’t see Lin Yun being suppressed, which was what they had predicted. On the other hand, Xu Dongfei threw out blood and retreated when Lin Yun made his move.

Everyone took a cold breath and froze as they looked at Xu Dongfei. Xu Dongfei stabilized himself with great difficulty, with his hair disarrayed and several holes in his clothes. They could even see the bloodstain on his body, and his aura had become chaotic. He was caught by surprise by Lin Yun and suffered a significant loss.

But Xu Dongfei was impressive because he didn’t suffer any severe injuries, even when he suffered such a significant loss.

“Lin Xiao!” Xu Dongfei’s hair was terrifyingly distorted, and his killing intent nearly gushed out from his pupils. Although he didn’t suffer any injuries, his image was totally ruined. If he challenged the Profound Fairy in this state, he would only end up as a laughingstock.

“I’m here. Sorry about that; I’ll go easy on you next time. After all, Brother Xu said that music dao is more terrifying than martial dao. Sorry about that.” Lin Yun smiled and said in a playful tone as he looked at Xu Dongfei.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were shocked by Lin Yun’s performance. Hearing what he said, they couldn’t help laughing. Lin Yun did the same thing by using Xu Dongfei’s words to slap his own face, but it was satisfying for them to watch.

It didn’t take long for all the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples to start laughing. Regardless of the outcome of this fight, Lin Yun had already helped them vent their pent-up emotions.

As Xu Dongfei’s face became even eerier, the corner of his lip twitched, and he nearly lost control of his emotions. Glaring at Lin Yun, Xu Dongfei roared and raised the golden flute to his lips once more, “This is just the beginning. You’ll be begging for mercy in a while!”

As he played his flute, a violent current rampaged, and Xu Dongfei unleashed his full strength without holding back. Very quickly, the current swept up by the music manifested into hundreds of sinister ghosts.

“Hundred Ghost Parade!” When the phenomenon began to take form, the faces of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples became grave. They knew that Xu Dongfei had finally become serious. This should be the trump card he prepared for the Profound Fairy.

When Xu Dongfei’s killing intent swept out along with his flute music, the ghosts he summoned pounced towards Lin Yun. Some of the ghosts were fake, and some were real. Thus, this made it even harder for everyone to determine which was fake and which was real.

Some sinister ghosts even looked like Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan, and this was meant to mess up the opponent’s state of mind. His method could be considered vicious.

But just when those ghosts were about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun smiled, and his music changed. The music soon manifested into a blazing sun that rose behind him. The blazing radiance incinerated all the ghosts that got close to him. This was an ancient score Lin Yun learned from Lil’ Purple, Sun and Moon.

As the zither music continued, the Golden Crow Saint Rune within Lin Yun’s profound palace ignited, and golden light shone from his body. When musical notes flew out from his fingers and overlapped with the golden light, Lin Yun looked mighty with his hair fluttering about. The golden light had manifested into golden blades under the sound waves flying towards Xu Dongfei’s lethal spots.

In the path of the golden blades, fine cracks were left in the surrounding space. But the tips of the blades were emitting a cold flash, filled with killing intent.

Seeing this, Xu Dongfei inwardly snorted. He had already suffered once and wouldn’t take Lin Yun lightly anymore. As his fingers moved on the flute, a crimson air current rose around him that swept the blades away. At the same time, Xu Dongfei closed his eyes, tilting his head back and forth to avoid the attacks while unleashing his attack with his music.

The crimson air current distorted into a vortex in the air, and there was a gigantic bone spear that flew out from the vortex.

“Golden Crow.” Lin Yun raised his head, and his fingers danced as he looked at the bone spear, which looked like it came from purgatory. Right then, densely packed golden crows flew out from the sun behind him.

“Holy shit…” All the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were utterly stumped by this scene. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had also reached the pinnacle of Noble Tone, and his mental cultivation was also deep and unfathomable.

The attacking means of a musician was a combination of mental energy and sound waves, in addition to their comprehension of music scores. Since Lin Yun could achieve such a terrifying phenomenon, his attainment in music dao wasn’t any weaker than Xu Dongfei; it may even be stronger!

As the golden crow and bone spear clashed, their collision manifested a terrifying wind current that stirred between them. This surprised Xu Dongfei, but his eyes soon turned cold, and crimson light began to be released from his body. As the crimson vortex grew in size behind him, it looked like it was about to turn into a crimson ocean. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the blink of an eye, the zither and flute music sped up, becoming so complicated that even the massive platform within the Cloud Fragrance Hall became distorted. Lin Yun and Xu Dongfei’s figures became blurred on the platform, and their focus reached unprecedented heights.

This was a dangerous exchange because they were both competing in their speed. This was the same as two peerless cultivators clashing in close combat. If either of them wasn’t careful, they would suffer a devastating attack.

Watching the clash between Lin Yun and Xu Dongfei, the entire Cloud Fragrance Hall became quiet. Regardless of the Exquisite Court or Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, both parties were nervous and didn’t dare to utter a word.

As the Yin-Yang symbol of wind and lightning energies revolved, a powerful thunderstorm energy exploded from the sun above Lin Yun. The outburst of energy immediately sent Xu Dongfei flying back.

“How can this fellow’s achievement in music dao be so terrifying?” Xu Dongfei had blood dripping from his lips, and he raised his head to eerily look at Lin Yun.

Suddenly, he tapped his left hand on a bizarre mark engraved on his chest. His facial expression became sinister as blood bled from his seven orifices in the next moment. Xu Dongfei was risking it all, and he roared, “Lin Xiao, I’ll defeat you today! The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion isn’t qualified to participate in the Nirvana Banquet!”

The music from his flute suddenly became sinister, and eighteen waves rose from the crimson ocean beneath him. As the waves roared and intertwined with the flute music, it formed into a bizarre array on the crimson ocean.

Before everyone could respond, a terrifying dragon roar echoed. But this dragon roar sounded evil, as though it was the embodiment of all the evils in the world. When Xu Dongfei started playing this score, the spiritual energy in the surroundings heavily fluctuated.

The disciples of the Exquisite Court all had excitement on their faces while Mu Xueling furrowed her brows with shock in the depths of her pupils.

Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan’s faces also changed as they yelled, “Young Master Lin, be careful! That’s an ancient sinister score, the Blood Dragon Scripture!”

Xu Dongfei’s face was sinister as a brutal light flashed across his pupils. It was already too late for Lin Yun to do anything. As a crimson dragon flew out from the crimson ocean, it emitted a horrifying aura that made everyone’s scalps numb, and some people even took several steps back.

This crimson dragon was sinister and ugly, enveloped in a black demonic light that appeared to be the embodiment of all evil. Countless sobbings could be heard coming from the crimson ocean, and those sobbings were filled with horror.

The crimson dragon turned around and swept a glance at everyone with a sticky liquid dripping down from its jaws. This scene scared everyone; some people even fell onto the ground with their faces becoming pale.

Mu Xueling was also shocked because this was probably meant for Yue Weiwei, and she realized that these people were really insane.
