Chapter 1681 – Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent

Lin Yun had five petals from the Heavenly Snow Lotus, and each petal looked like a blood jade emitting a slight chill when he held onto it. After briefly playing with it, Lin Yun placed a petal into his mouth.

It didn’t take long for the petal to melt in his mouth, turning into a cooling spiritual liquid that emitted a crimson glow. Lin Yun controlled the liquid through his body with his dragon runes and poured them on his first dragon pulse, and the spiritual liquid was like a fine rain that was slowly entering his dragon pulse.

Seeing this, Lin Yun rejoiced because he knew that it was effective. In the past, he consumed various elixirs, including the Blue Dragon Spiritual Aura of the Blue Dragon Bone, but none of the energy could enter his dragon pulses. Since his dragon pulses were damaged, it was futile, regardless of how powerful the elixirs he consumed were.

But his dragon pulse was like a sponge as they absorbed the spiritual liquid from the Heavenly Snow Lotus, and the spiritual energy could penetrate his dragon pulses. As time passed, his dragon pulses had absorbed the petal of the heavenly Snow Lotus, and his damaged dragon pulses had been repaired with fine crimson threads connecting them. His dragon pulses were slowly being restored.

Seeing that it was effective, Lin Yun rejoiced and consumed the remaining petals. When he refined the four petals, his first dragon pulse was more or less repaired. He discovered that his cultivation had also been restored to the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But because his other dragon pulses were still damaged, it was still painful for him to circulate his dragon origin.

I should be able to repair the remaining damages with the Blue Dragon Bone. Lin Yun pondered. When Lin Yun used the last Heavenly Snow Lotus petal to fix the second dragon pulse, he noticed that the effects had dwindled. If he wanted to repair it like his first pulse, he would need at least ten petals.

But Lin Yun wasn’t anxious and knew he couldn’t be in a hurry. After all, he had exceeded his limit when he summoned the Sovereign Constellation and Firmament Saint Cloth, and he didn’t hold much hope in that he could quickly recover to his peak.

After nourishing his dragon pulses with the Blue Dragon Bone for three days, he left the Skyflowing Island. There was no longer any problem if he only used one dragon pulse. Although his strength couldn’t be compared to his peak, it wasn’t as troublesome as it was at the beginning, with all of his cultivation practically crippled.

Gigantic waves would rise from the massive sea. The Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea was practically boundless, and a person was standing on the violent sea’s surface.

This person has donning a white robe and playing the flute. Although he seemed like he didn’t move, his figure swiftly traveled along the waves. This person was naturally Lin Yun, and no matter how violent the waves were, Lin Yun was as firm as a mountain while playing his flute.

It had been seven days since he left Skyflowing Island, and he didn’t waste any time. He would play the Phoenix Heart Song daily, tempering his soul energy that had reached the third-grade Saint Spiritualist.

The Heavenly Heart Song was equivalent to a cultivation technique, a secret technique of the Divine Phoenix Clan. It was one of the rare secret techniques that could temper mental energy.

A few thousand miles away, the sky was covered with thunderclouds, and the sea's surface raged with massive waves. Lin Yun glanced at it from afar because it was customary to encounter something like this on the ocean.

There was a high chance of a terrifying storm on an ordinary ocean, not to mention that this was the Unholy Sea. This also wasn’t Lin Yun’s first time encountering this kind of weather, and he would choose to leave most of the time. That’s because the storm would generally mean there was a demonic beast around, and there were many Samsara Edict Realm demonic beasts within the Unholy Sea. Lin Yun wasn’t stupid to think that he could face those demonic beasts.

“That’s…?” Just when Lin Yun was prepared to leave, he could see the faint outline of a ship in the storm. Compared to the torrential waves, that ship seemed small, as if it would be devoured by the waves the next moment.

The impacts of those waves were terrifying, and the waves could easily reach ten thousand miles away. The sheer impacts alone could heavily injure or even kill Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

Lin Yun executed the Divine Dragon Eyes, with a sun and a moon appearing in his pupils. Once everything cleared up within his eyes, he could see a terrifying demonic beast hidden in the sea, and that ship was bearing the Heavenly Note Sect’s flag.

“What a small world…” Lin Yun muttered as he closed the Divine Dragon Eyes. Lin Wan had previously invited him, but he merely said they would meet again if they were fated, and that was just half a month ago.

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun stowed the Divine Jade Bamboo Flute and dashed over with Thunderstorm Intent enveloping him.

At the heart of the storm, the Heavenly Note Sect’s ship was swaying around within the waves. The spiritual arrays on the ship were already activated, or the ship would’ve capsized long ago. In the sea, multiple black serpents were moving about, creating countless vortexes with powerful suction forces that trapped the ship within this region.

Occasionally, the serpents would even jump out and pounce at the ship. When the serpents dashed over, musical notes would echo from the ship that turned into various phenomena that sent the serpents back. The offensive ability of those musical notes was powerful, and they were even more powerful when combined.

But when the serpents returned to the sea, those musical notes couldn’t reach them anymore, and the Heavenly Note Sect’s disciples were also incapable of fighting the serpents alone. Thus, the stalemate continued, placing the Heavenly Note Sect’s ship in a terrible situation.

On the ship, Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were standing together, and their faces were ugly because they never expected to run into a den of serpents. Aquatic serpents were considered a rare species of demonic beasts, and you would run into a den of them the moment they appeared. Their route was usually safe, so it was unheard of for anyone to run into aquatic serpents here.

“Senior Sister Lin, what should we do now?” Luo Shuyi asked.

“We have two ways. First is to wait because other ships will pass by within two days.” Lin Wan replied.

“But what if we fail to wait for any ships to appear within the next two days? We can make it out unscathed, but our fellow martial sisters…” Luo Shuyi sighed.

Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan’s cultivation were comparable to the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, especially Lin Wan, who could face cultivators at the fifth-pulse. They could leave if they wanted to, but without the ship's protection, the other martial sisters would have great difficulty escaping the pursuit of those aquatic serpents, and they would be in grave danger at that time.

Her gaze was at a distance, looking at a black aquatic serpent coiled up in mid-air. This serpent created the surrounding storm. This was an overlord demonic beast at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. The other serpents would leave if they could kill or heavily injure this demonic beast. The logic was the same as a pack of wolves.

Luo Shuyi’s face was pale when she heard that. They managed to break into the storm with the help of the ship earlier, but they couldn’t injure that aquatic serpent. That aquatic serpent was terrifying, and it had a crimson horn on its head, showing signs of evolving into a dragon.

But Luo Shuyi soon made up her mind and said, “Let’s go.”

They might seem to have two choices, but they really only had one since they couldn’t abandon their martial sisters. Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi informed their fellow martial sisters before they flew towards that black storm.

“Senior Sister, be careful!” The women on the ship yelled. They were all nervous, but they couldn’t afford to be distracted, or the ship would capsize.

Lin Wan carried a lute while Luo Shuyi wielded a jade flute as they entered the storm. At the heart of the storm, there was a black aquatic serpent that was a few hundred feet in length that was coiled up.

Lin Wan was the first to launch her attack. She swiftly played her lute, sending countless musical notes that flew from her fingers. The musical notes charged out like warriors. On the other hand, Luo Shuyi was gentler. Her musical notes manifested into a woman with a height of a hundred feet.

That woman was like a deity, filled with nobility and elegance. Under the control of the flute music, that woman simply raised ten waves with a raise of her hand, charging at the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As the waves condensed, the tides gradually formed into ten-odd water dragons that charged forth. When the water dragons dashed forth, the space around them cracked, which meant that each of the water dragons was terrifying.

The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent coldly looked at the two women with greed flashing in its pupils, as if it was looking at two peerless treasures. As the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent stretched its body, it dashed forth with its tail lashing out at the ten-odd water dragons.

Opening its mouth, it let out a ferocious roar that sounded like a dragon roar. The army Lin Wan had manifested with musical notes was swiftly eroded under the soundwaves.

This shocked Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi because the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent was a little too terrifying. This was an aquatic serpent that possessed a dragon’s bloodline. Although the bloodline was thin, it was still the genuine dragon’s bloodline, just that it was filled with evil.

“I’m still worried that the two of you might escape, but I never expected that you two would run over on your own.” The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent said coldly. “Since you guys are here, then come over!”

When it let out a roar, a terrifying aura suppressed the two women, causing their faces to change. The next moment, a water geyser shot at the two women from the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent’s mouth.

This made Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s hearts sink. This was because they never expected that the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent would be so terrifying and didn’t look like other ordinary overlord demonic beasts.
