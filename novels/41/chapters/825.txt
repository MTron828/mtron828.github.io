Chapter 826 - Great Battle’s Arrival!

Two figures descended onto the stage after the announcement was made. Bai Lixuan, who was dressed in white, was facing Lin Yun. Compared to Bai Lixuan who wore a grave expression, Lin Yun seemed very relaxed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You more or less know my trump cards, and it won’t be easy to beat you,” said Bai Lixuan. Facing Lin Yun once more, Bai Lixuan was filled with complicated feelings. Both of them had a long way to go and he didn’t want to obsess over victory. Even though their grudge from a long time ago was resolved, he still wanted to try his best. After all, his pride as a swordsman wouldn’t allow him to surrender before fighting.

“No need to be so self-deprecating. It won’t be easy for me to win,” replied Lin Yun. Although Bai Lixuan had lost to Zhao Wuji and Zhu Qingshan, Lin Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to win without bringing out his spiritual sword intent. He had a deep impression of the three attacks Bai Lixuan used against Zhao Wuji, mostly with the second one. If he had the opportunity to analyze the second attack, he would be able to improve his Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

“Take my attack.” Bai Lixuan drew his sword as a hum filled the stage. Shortly after, the entire stage began to tremble violently as lightning rumbled throughout the sky. Bai Lixuan’s figure began to overlap with the clouds and the surrounding air was distorted.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with shock because he knew how powerful this attack was. Since space had been distorted, he couldn’t lock onto Bai Lixuan’s aura. If Zhao Wuji’s lightning intent hadn’t been so powerful, there was no way he could have taken this sword head-on.

“Clapping Thunder!” Bai Lixuan roared and stabbed his sword at Lin Yun. His figure then started to distort as he changed into a dragon that charged at Lin Yun.

To be honest, Lin Yun couldn’t see through this attack. But he knew that it would be enough if his sword was faster than Bai Lixuan. When Bai Lixuan’s sword came, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and he swung his sword.

When their swords collided, a terrifying sword ray exploded and obliterated the stage. In the blink of an eye, they exchanged over a dozen moves.

“Moonbreaking Lightning!” Bai Lixuan’s eyes flashed coldly as he retreated. With a flick of his wrist, a flash of dazzling lightning exploded and a waterfall made of lightning was formed.

But before the waterfall could do anything, it was split in half by Lin Yun’s sword that was empowered by the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. Then, Lin Yun created a sword ray that manifested a majestic dragon.

“He’s too strong…” Bai Lixuan’s face changed and pushed his movement technique to the limit. The sword ray that was only half an azure dragon suddenly manifested fully, and Lin Yun could sense the terrifying aura coming from it.

“Azure Dragon Rage!” Bai Lixuan was forced to push his Azure Dragon Sword Sutra to the limit as dazzling lightning flickered on his sword. The boundless sword aura in the atmosphere instantly manifested into an azure dragon under the lightning sword intent.

“Wind!” laughed Bai Lixuan.

A gale formed over the lake that created a wave over 100 meters tall. The gale started to empower Bai Lixuan’s azure dragon, making it even more vivid than before.

The two dragons clashed and Bai Lixuan ultimately managed to take Lin Yun’s attack head-on. But Lin Yun’s sword continued forward, turning into wind that contained a wisp of lightning.

Bai Lixuan frowned his brows and stabbed his sword out as well, but all of his attacks missed. Right at this moment, the Azure Dragon Sword Aura reached a terrifying level that suddenly spread out. It coiled around Bai Lixuan and trapped him, preventing him from moving. Lin Yun appeared in mid-air and a ferocious dragon head appeared above his left shoulder.

When Lin Yun and the azure dragon’s eyes fixed onto Bai Lixuan, he spit up blood.

“You won,” said Bai Lixuan with a pale face. These words surprised Lin Yun because he knew that Bai Lixuan could still put up a fight.

“I’ll only humiliate myself if we continue to fight. Your Azure Dragon Sword Aura is terrifying, which helped me understand where I stand in comparison to you. Plus, I need to save some of my moves for other people,” replied Bai Lixuan while sheathing his sword. He had the Azure Dragon Sword Sutra, so it should be easier for him to grasp the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. However, he couldn’t combine them no matter how he tried and could only try to comprehend lightning intent.

With the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, Lin Yun might be able to fight the three kings. After all, Bai Lixuan still had feelings for the Sword Firmament Pavilion and naturally hoped that Lin Yun could go further.

Instantly understanding Bai Lixuan’s thoughts, Lin Yun gained newfound respect for Bai Lixuan. After devouring half of Bai Lixuan’s profound amber aura, Lin Yun’s dragon projection grew even more dazzling with signs of growing a fifth claw.

“Lin Yun is now the strongest swordsman in the banquet.”

“His Azure Dragon Sword Aura is really strong since it suppressed Bai Lixuan’s lightning sword intent. It even seems to be stronger than Fang Hanluo’s quasi-spiritual sword intent.”

“Indeed, I didn’t expect that Lin Yun would win so easily.”

Many people were shocked at how easily Lin Yun won. He only had four opponents left, Zhu Qingshan, Yan Long’zi, Zhao Wuji, and Yu Haotian. Although he hadn’t fought with Jiang Ziye, everyone knew that Jiang Ziye couldn’t defeat Lin Yun. After all, she could barely defeat Fang Hanluo who was heavily injured.

“Azure Dragon Sword Aura?” Yan Long’zi’s face turned grave before he sneered. It wouldn’t be a threat to him now that he had seen it. He was confident that he could suppress Lin Yun if he didn’t hold back. After all, no swordsman made it into the top three over the past millennia.

Soon after, Zhu Qingshan, Fang Hanluo, Yu Haotian, and Jiang Ziye made their rounds on the stage. Fang Hanluo fought Yu Haotian, but the outcome was instantly determined. Relying on his Overlord Fist, Yu Haotian easily defeated Fang Hanluo with one move.

Jiang Ziye and Zhu Qingshan’s battle was more intense as they exchanged over a hundred moves. But in the end, Zhu Qingshan won after he used the Soul Devour and Blood Devour to defeat Jiang Ziye. He defeated her in the same manner he defeated Bai Lixuan.

The next battle was between Wu Xiaotian and Zhao Wuji. There was zero tension for this fight because Jiang Ziye couldn’t even defeat Zhao Wuji. If she couldn’t defeat him, there was no way Wu Xiaotian could.

“Lin Yun VS Yan Long’zi!” The announcement made the crowd go wild. Lin Yun was finally fighting against the three kings. If he, the strongest dark horse, lost, then no one could defeat the three kings.

Out of all the three kings, Yan Long’zi had the strongest physique. His reputation in the Ancient Southern Domain was only inferior to Yu Haotian and was at the same level as Zhao Wuji.

Lin Yun was the strongest dark horse and the strongest swordsman in the entire banquet. His popularity wasn’t any worse than the three kings. On top of these qualifications, Yan Long’zi and Lin Yun resented each other, so neither wanted to lose the fight.
