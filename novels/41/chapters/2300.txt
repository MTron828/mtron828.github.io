Chapter 2301 - Divine Phoenix Mountain

Lin Yun arrived at Divine Phoenix Mountain on the third day after he left the God Burial Mountain Range. The outer region of Divine Phoenix Mountain was similar to the Heavenly Dao Sect, filled with mountains that were enveloped in spiritual aura and several flourishing cities.

They could be considered as the outer region of Divine Phoenix Mountain. Divine Phoenix Mountain imparts its martial techniques here, which was why even the outer sect could be considered a formidable force to be reckoned with.

In other words, only those belonging to the Ji Clan could enter the true Divine Phoenix Mountain, and those people possessed the phoenix bloodline. Most of Divine Phoenix Mountain’s martial techniques required the phoenix bloodline as the foundation. Those without a phoenix bloodline could only practice ordinary martial techniques.

Lin Yun was here as a guest, so he was brought to where the real Divine Phoenix Mountain was located. A celestial realm appeared before Lin Yun after they passed through various barriers.

Countless pavilions were hovering in the air with some inverted floating mountains with palaces, giving off an ancient radiance. This was weird because it differed from other sects or holy lands that Lin Yun had been to.

The mountains had pierced the sky while hovering in the air. The bottom was a spacious plaza with a statue on it. The outer region of the plaza was the mountains, and various birds could be seen in the surrounding area.

After everyone entered, someone soon came to bring Ji Zixi away. She didn’t even have time to talk to Lin Yun, making these people extremely mysterious.

As for Lin Yun, he was guided by the Astral River Saint Sovereign to an empty mountain.

“This is the Stream Cloud Residence, one of the ten palaces closest to the divine mountain. Even Saint Elders have to wait to cultivate here,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign smiled as he explained.

Lin Yun nodded with a smile, but said nothing. He could tell that this place was suitable to cultivate, but he couldn’t make a quick breakthrough since he had become a Saint. On the contrary, it might be troublesome if he caused a huge commotion while cultivating here.

“Aside from this mountain, you can feel free to go anywhere you want. There isn't any forbidden ground, and I will accompany you in this period,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign smiled.

Lin Yun looked around, and said, “I wonder when the Last Sky Great Saint will be free to speak with me about the Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

The Astral River Saint Sovereign briefly pondered, before he said, “I actually know a bit or two about that Heavenly Slaughter Empress, but I’ll let the master tell you about it.”

“The holy master of the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Lin Yun was surprised. This person was a famous expert in Eastern Desolation.

Tian Xuanzi was known to be invincible beneath the Emperor Realm in the Eastern Desolation, but the holy master of the Divine Phoenix Mountain had that title for a long time. If anyone could rival Tian Xuanzi beneath the Emperor Realm or defeat him, it would be this person.

“Yeah. Since you’re here on Divine Phoenix Mountain, the master will naturally take time to meet you. You can ask him if you have any questions. He will know more about secrets like that,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign said.

“Okay.” Lin Yun nodded. He also wanted to meet this person. If he could convince this person to help during his master’s tribulation, they would have a higher odds of winning.

With Yu Qingfeng’s intimidation, no Emperors would interfere in his master’s tribulation.

“I’ll take my leave, then,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign cupped his fists before leaving.

Lin Yun casually glanced at the residence before putting the sword box down. Unless it was a time-space treasure, no place was more suitable to cultivate than the Iris Secret Realm.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After Lin Yun formed a seal with his hands, he entered the Iris Secret Realm with a flash. The moment he entered, a dazzling light shone, signifying that a sun was hovering above the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun widened his mouth because the Iris Secret Realm became almost unrecognisable. The Iris Sword Box was kept with Lil’ Purple after he left the Fallen God Valley, so this was his first time entering the Iris Secret Realm after that.

The cracks in the sky had recovered, and the sky looked realistic with clouds and a sun. At the center, the Phoenix Tree had grown to a hundred feet with a radiance that made it look sacred.

The spiritual energy was much denser, with grass on the ground and a waterfall on a faraway mountain. If Lin Yun remembered correctly, the ground had always been barren; but now the other cultivating grounds were showing signs of recovery.

Aside from that, Lin Yun could sense a slight distortion in time and space. It was weak, but it existed. This shocked Lin Yun since it was too unbelievable.

This meant that the time here differed from the outside world, meaning the sword box was a time-space treasure.

“This is really a time-space treasure…” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“Hmph, since when have I lied to you? This is only the beginning. This is merely a fraction of the Iris Secret Realm’s prime,” Lil’ Purple said pridefully. “If you can gather all seven Sovereign Divine Runes, it’ll be equivalent to carrying a holy land on your back as you cultivate. At that time, your cultivation speed will become unimaginable.”

Lin Yun smiled, “I look forward to it. But how is time here compared to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?”

“It’s inferior by a lot. Time is almost similar to the outside world and can’t achieve the effect you want,” Lil’ Purple said as her smile disappeared.

Lin Yun looked around and smiled, “It’s fine. Oh, right. I remember you saying that this region is the Celestial Lake with the Divine Bamboo Forest here.”

“Yeah. This is the Divine Bamboo Forest, but the seeds are in the ground. They’re gorgeous when fully grown, and you can play the zither here. It will sound beautiful,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun smiled as he came over to the Phoenix Tree. The biggest transformation of the Iris Secret Realm was that cultivating beneath the Phoenix Tree was much faster than the Stream Cloud Residence.

“How does it feel to be on Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Lin Yun asked.

“Divine Phoenix Mountain is related to the Divine Phoenix Clan. Everyone possesses the phoenix bloodline, and they might have been my servants in the past,” Lil’ Purple said, holding onto her chin.

“Don’t bullshit. You previously said that the Ming Cult’s ancestor was your disciple, and nearly drove the Thousand Seal Great Saint insane,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lil’ Purple blushed and said, “W-Wasn’t that because I was anxious to save you and created a bigger commotion to intimidate them?”

Lin Yun was surprised because he noticed Lil’ Purple had become more adorable after coming out of the Fallen God Valley.

“What about you?” Lil’ Purple changed the topic.

“It feels weird. They seem to have separated me from Ji Zixi on purpose. They must have a huge secret related to the divine flame fragment,” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“They probably want to temper that lass’ bloodline with the divine flame fragment, allowing her to possess the Divine Phoenix Physique,” Lil’ Purple analysed. “Speaking of which, her aptitude is really good. She can be considered a divine maiden even in ancient times.”

“Such a high evaluation?” Lin Yun was surprised.

Lil’ Purple became unhappy and refuted, “Are you looking down on the Divine Phoenix Clan’s bloodline?!”

Lin Yun smiled, but said nothing. A brief moment later, he said, “Aside from that, I feel something special here. There might be an inconvenient secret here to share with me.”

“You feel that you’re being neglected?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he replied, “A little.”

After all, he had saved the Divine Phoenix Mountain's group and gave them the divine flame fragment. But after coming to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, he could sense that everyone had put some distance between him and them, despite being respectful to him, including the Astral River Saint Sovereign.

Lil’ Purple said with heartache, “You’re too impulsive. I already told you that you always think for others, but no one thinks for you. Divine Phoenix Mountain is isolated from the outside world, with everyone here belonging to the Ji Clan, possessing the phoenix bloodline. Do you think they don’t know you have an ulterior motive in coming here?”

Lin Yun said, “Senior Brother told me a little about that, but I still had to make a trip over.”

Lil’ Purple stood up and pulled Lin Yun away with a smile, “It’s fine. They don’t care about you, but I do. Let me tell you a little secret.”

Lin Yun was caught by surprise as Lil’ Purple dragged him out.

Lil’ Purple mysteriously said, “I discovered a huge secret after coming to Divine Phoenix Mountain.”

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Hehe, there’s a Sovereign Divine Rune here!” Lil’ Purple said excitedly.

Lin Yun asked, “You’re talking about the Sinful Fire Divine Rune?”

Lil’ Purple had already obtained three of the seven Sovereign Divine Runes. The Freezing Chill Divine Rune was in the Frostsnow Sacred Palace. There weren’t any clues about the Samsara and Nirvana Divine Runes. That meant they were only left with the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.

“That’s right,” Lil’ Purple said. “We can look for it tonight while they’re focused on their little princess and see if we can find it.”

Lin Yun smiled. Lil’ Purple wanted to repeat what she did in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Are you coming with me? I’ll go myself if you’re not going!” Lil’ Purple said.
