Chapter 644 - A Cup Without Wine

Bloodwolf and Chief Leng weren’t like those ordinary experts in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. Facing the two would be tougher than facing the three Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders. After all, BLoodwolf had the Flamedragon Armor.

As for Chief Leng, he had been concealing his strength the whole time because he was even stronger than the Grand Elder of the Bloodwing Pavilion’s outer sect. Not to mention that there were two other Yin-Yang stage experts around.

Logically speaking, it should be easy for them to kill a cultivator in the Yang stage. But Lin Yun possessed a spiritual seal. It was more important for them to seize Lin Yun’s seal, which was the true reason behind why they moved.

Looking at Chief Leng and Bloodwolf charging over, Lin Yun swept his gaze briefly before charging at Bloodwolf.

“You’re courting death!” Bloodwolf snickered and pushed his palm out. Boundless flames surged out from his armor and flew towards Lin Yun. It might seem like a simple attack, but it wasn’t as simple as it looked.

Palm techniques tended to be less explosive and less sophisticated than fist techniques. Meanwhile, fist techniques focused on ferocity and explosive power.

Bloodwolf had perfectly fused the advantage of a fist and palm technique perfectly. When he clenched his fist, the boundless flames condensed into a dragon that released a resounding roar. It caused the entire palace to start trembling.

“No!” Leng Xiangyun yelled with her face turning pale.

But facing such a terrifying aura, Lin Yun was indifferent. Since he had chosen Bloodwolf, he naturally had the confidence to deal with him. “Great!”

Seven Slaughtering Seal!

Lin Yun formed a seal with one hand and his killing aura began to surge violently. His black hair began to flutter in the wind like a fiendgod who came from hell.

In a split second, his killing aura began to multiply. In the next second, everywhere within a hundred meter radius looked like an ocean of killing aura. Even someone as powerful as Bloodwolf felt his movements becoming slow. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Raging Sky!

Lin Yun threw out a punch with the Seven Slaughtering Seal as his eyes flashed brightly. When the two punches collided in the sky, Lin Yun made use of the rebound force to disappear, causing Chief Leng to miss his attack.

When Chief Leng and Bloodwolf found Lin Yun again, they realized that Lin Yun had already bypassed their blockade. But Lin Yun had a trace of blood on his lip as he had clearly suffered some injuries.

“This…” This scene left everyone surprised. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun took a palm from Bloodwolf. Not only was he alive, but he only suffered some light injuries, which was unbelievable.

“Stop him!” Chief Leng roared anxiously. Lin Yun wasn’t dead and he even made use of the rebound force from Bloodwolf to bypass their blockade.

The two other chiefs snorted as they charged towards Lin Yun, executing their strongest attacks. They arrived in front of Lin Yun in the blink of an eye, so there wasn’t an opportunity for him to escape. But it was a pity that they were a lot weaker than Chief Leng and Bloodwolf, despite being in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. They were so weak that Lin Yun thought the Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders were stronger.

So what could these two do to him?

Seven Slaughtering Fist—Defiant Frustration, Resonance!

Lin Yun soared into the sky and threw out two punches. In the next second, his boundless killing aura combined together and began overlapping like waves. Relying on the Seven Slaughtering Seal’s killing aura, Lin Yun held the upper hand against the two Yin-Yang stage chiefs.

When both sides clashed, a bizarre scene occurred as they were both sent flying by Lin Yun.

“How is this possible?” Chief Leng was dumbfounded by this scene. He was even more shocked by this scene than when Lin Yun received Bloodwolf’s attack head-on. He couldn’t believe that someone in the greater Yang stage actually forced two lesser Yin-Yang stage experts back. Was this youth’s name not really on the Dragoncloud Ranking?

Lin Yun smiled. If he couldn’t crush these two, then all his efforts would go down the drain. When he landed on the ground, he tapped his foot on the ground to dash towards the azure dragon painting.

They still weren’t in the core region, so Lin Yun didn’t want to reveal too many of his trump cards. It didn’t matter if it was Chief Leng or Bloodwolf, they weren’t easy to deal with and he only had a 60% chance of winning. So even if he could win, there was no doubt in his mind that he would be heavily injured.

If that happened, he would definitely die rather than obtain the treasures. So, from the start, he had made up his mind not to clash with them head-on.

But just when he was five hundred meters away from the painting, a figure suddenly appeared before him. It was Master Fu from the Bloodwolf Clan. This fellow had been eyeing him right from the start and Lin Yun would’ve taught him a lesson if he didn’t have any concerns.

“Hehe, you didn’t expect me, right? Since I’m here, you can dream of leaving.” Master Fu smiled sinisterly as spiritual runes began to spread around him. But just when he was about to bring out his spiritual artifact, Lin Yun’s speed suddenly increased and left behind nine afterimages.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he gave Master Fu a slap. Taking the slap head-on, the old man threw up a mouthful of blood and some teeth. Half of his face had swollen up like a pig’s head. Looking at Master Fu struggling to get back on his feet, Lin Yun said coldly, “You’re just a piece of trash. I wanted to slap you a long time ago.”

“You bastard!” Master Fu said before he started twitching from the pain coming from his cheek.

Suddenly, a dangerous aura locked onto Lin Yun. Lin Yun didn’t even need to turn back to know that Bloodwolf and Chief Leng must’ve caught up to him. But it wouldn’t be easy for those two to try and obstruct him.

As the Golden Crow Seal bloomed behind him, Lin Yun pushed the Seven Profound Steps to the limit and emitted a dazzling golden light.When he spread his arms apart, he had disappeared as if he had teleported.

This caused Chief Leng and Bloodwolf to miss. When they raised their heads, they saw that Lin Yun had already placed his palm on the painting.

The painting began to fluctuate before it started to emit an azure radiance that enveloped Lin Yun. In the next second, Bloodwolf and Chief Leng had arrived as they placed their palms on the painting as well. But the painting had already dimmed down as their attacks only caused an explosion in the palace that failed to reach Lin Yun.

“Damn it!” Bloodwolf and Chief Leng’s faces were ugly. They both felt humiliated that they actually allowed a brat in the greater Yang stage to escape.

“Don’t let me run into you again!” Bloodwolf cursed before placing his palm on the vermillion bird painting and disappearing into the core region with Master Fu.

“Let’s go quickly. Don’t let them grab the treasures first!” Chief Leng said with a grave expression before entering the white tiger painting with Leng Xiangyun and the two chiefs.

After everyone left, the silence in the palace didn’t last for long before the gates opened once more with Feng Wuhen and Master Gu walking in.

“Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird… it looks like there are three people with the spiritual seal. Besides Bloodwolf and that Dog Leng, who else is there?” Master Gu had doubt in his eyes. The spiritual seal was designed to be secretive, so no one could discover anything without having a high attainment in spiritual runes. When they reached the last gate, they realized that three spiritual seals had already been taken.

“It looks like things are getting more interesting than I imagined,” smiled Feng Wuhen. Initially, he thought that he had complete control over the situation. After all, he was the one who purposely let Bloodwolf have the treasure map. But judging from the situation right now, it appeared that there were quite a few people at his party.

But if anyone dared to compete with him for the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon, they had to die. Feng Wuhen’s face had a ruthlessness and viciousness that didn’t suit his age, which was extremely strange.

In the core region, Lin Yun found himself in an exquisite room with a stone table before him. Looking at the delicate jade cup on the table, Lin Yun took it and examined it briefly, “A cup without wine?”

Lin Yun then started looking around in the room and was surprised to discover that the wall had a detailed map of the core region along with some dying words. The core region was divided into three levels and each level contained treasures that Lei Yunzi had gathered during his lifetime.

As for the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon and his coffin, they were at the third level waiting for the fated person. But before that, there were nine rooms, each with small gifts left behind by Lei Yunzi. After passing through the nine runes, one would receive a valuable gift based on the spiritual seals.

But it wouldn’t be easy to obtain the gifts. Not only were there restrictions and mechanisms in the rooms, one also had to rely on fate. For example, there was a cup without any wine in this room and Lin Yun had to find it.

“This doesn’t look like the actions that a demon should have. Giving a gift first?” Lin Yun smiled after he was done examining the cup. Even if he was cautious, he didn’t have much concern about it. Since there was a gift here, then he naturally had to taste it before considering anything else. He refused to believe that he could lose to someone who had already died.
