Chapter 1854 - Attitude

The Fire God General’s corpse fell into the sea with a splash. The Fire God General was a famous figure in the Eastern Desolation for over two decades, but he only caused such a small splash with his death.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But Lin Yun wore an unsatisfied expression because he didn’t even bring out his full strength in his fight against the Fire God General.

The black-clothed Quasi-Saint became furious when he saw this scene, but he fell into a dilemma when he saw Gu Jun standing before him.

“Gu Jun, don’t let him go! Stop him!” When a holy land’s genius saw that the black-clothed Quasi-Saint intended to retreat, he immediately spoke out.

Those words naturally drew the black-clothed Quasi-Saint’s attention, but he could only reluctantly leave. As for Gu Jun, he had no intentions of stopping this black-clothed man from leaving.

On the other hand, Lin Yun sat on the ground with his legs crossed together and adjusted his breathing. He wasn’t recovering from his injuries because he was barely even injured in the previous battle. So he was digesting the Demigod Wine within his body.

After this battle, Lin Yun finally realized that he was lucky that he didn’t explode from the three cups of wine back then. The accumulated energy within his body was greater than he had imagined, and he had barely used one-tenth of it in his battle with the Fire God General.

When he reopened his eyes, the other holy land geniuses turned their attention over. Most of their expressions were awkward and complicated as they looked at Lin Yun, while the Ming Cult’s disciples were furiously looking at him. This naturally drew his curiosity, and he turned to look at An Liuyan, who was walking over. He asked, “What’s going on?”

“The Wind God General and Lightning God General weren’t able to leave in time and were killed by Elder Gu. They both had many things from the holy land disciples.” An Liuyan explained.

“What’s the matter? You can just accept them.” Lin Yun said casually.

“This isn’t the same. Many treasures belonged to the six holy lands, including those they obtained in the Black Tortoise Vault. There are even…” An Liuyan continued to explain.

“Even what?” Lin Yun asked.

“Young Master, Ji Lingfeng’s Blood Phoenix Blade was also taken away by them.” An Liuyan said with a bitter smile.

With that, Lin Yun finally understood what was happening, and it was no wonder why An Liuyan couldn’t decide. Even if they were to keep everything they obtained from the two god generals, the Blood Phoenix Blade wasn’t something that they could take. This was why An Liuyan wanted Lin Yun to decide which to keep and which to return.

“Young Master, what do you think we should do? I have already tried to appease them earlier.” An Liuyan asked, looking at Lin Yun.

“Return it to them.” Lin Yun said without hesitation and decided based on his instincts. But that didn’t mean he was kind-hearted. He already had a lot of harvest from the Black Tortoise Vault, and these treasures couldn’t catch his attention.

Those that caught his attention were Glory Saint Artifacts, but those belonged to the six holy lands, such as the Blood Phoenix Blade. This was why Lin Yun might as well return them all since keeping them would spell trouble. Thus, he might as well return them to their owners as a favor.

When the holy land’s geniuses received their treasures, their expressions loosened up. After all, Lin Yun was domineering back at the Black Tortoise Vault; killing whoever stood in his way regardless of whether his enemy was a genius of the holy land or not. Thus, this was why everyone was afraid that he would leave with their treasures.

But if Lin Yun knew what they were thinking, they would probably laugh out loud. After all, what treasure could be comparable to the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown and Demigod Wine? What could compare to the Black Tortoise Chains and Thunder Demon Subduing Beads?

It wasn’t that Lin Yun was arrogant, but he had obtained too much. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that what they harvested was garbage.

“Lin Xiao, thanks! I owe you one, hahaha!” Disregarding everyone else's thoughts, Ji Lingfeng laughed when he took back his beloved blade. The Heavenly Dao Sect and Divine Phoenix Mountain’s disciples all cupped their hands together as well.

On the other hand, the Heavenly Flame Sect, Divine Dao Pavilion, and Myriad Lightning Sect’s disciples looked awkward and embarrassed, wanting to dig a hole and hide in it. After all, they had waited for Lin Yun to show up with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown for half a month. But the Blood Moon Sect snatched their treasures, and they had to rely on Lin Yun to take them back. This was the greatest mockery in the world.

After a long silence, Yan Chihuo finally spoke up and clasped his hands together, “Thank you, Brother Lin. Two companions of my sect died, but you have avenged their deaths.”

“You’re welcome. It’s nothing to me.” Lin Yun didn’t put on any airs and responded by cupping his hands together.

“This time, the Heavenly Flame Sect owes you one. When my sect’s Quasi-Saint comes, I’ll tell him the truth.” Yan Chihuo said. When everyone else saw Lin Yun’s response, they breathed a sigh of relief and cupped their hands together as a form of gratitude.

“Owe him one? These belonged to us, to begin with. All he did was return them to the owners.” Right then, a disorientated voice resounded as Huang Xuanyi jumped out.

This naturally made everyone furrow their brows because they were unhappy with Huang Xuanyi’s behavior.

“And him! We all suffered humiliation at the hands of that Blood Moon Sect’s Quasi-Saint, and he allowed that fellow to leave. If that Blood Moon Sect’s Quasi-Saint spreads rumors, it’ll humiliate our holy lands!” Huang Xuanyi pointed at Gu Jun, and coldly said, “You are to be blamed!”

Gu Jun immediately lost it on the spot, wanting to give Huang Xuanyi a slap to death.

“Do you dare to touch me?” Huang Xuanyi said coldly. “You can’t beat a Quasi-Saint of the Blood Moon Sect, and yet you want to take it out on me?”

Fuming with rage, Gu Jun smiled, squinting, “So, I’m a sinner, according to you?”

“Only you know what’s on your mind then, and you’re on your own.” Huang Xuanyi said indifferently.

“Haha!” Gu Jun smiled and stroked his beard. This scene left everyone stumped because they never expected Huang Xuanyi to be so shameless.

“As for you…” Huang Xuanyi turned to Lin Yun and continued, “My Senior Brother, Yu Wenxiu, was a genius. He’d become a Saint’s disciple after this, and yet you have committed an unforgivable sin by killing the disciple of my Ming Cult!”

As a smear of sarcasm flashed across Xiao Yuanqi’s pupils, he snickered, “Why don’t you say that your senior brother is a genius of the millennium? Why don’t you say that your senior brother is the disciple of a Great Saint and not a Saint instead?”

Yan Chihuo showed displeasure on his face, and he joined in, “Brother Huang, don’t drag the Heavenly Flame Sect into the feud between your Ming Cult and Lin Xiao. If not for Lin Xiao and Elder Gu, who knows what humiliation we would have suffered today.”

“Even if they didn’t save our lives, they at least saved half of our lives.” Yi Feng stood out as well. “Brother Yan is right. The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown is a matter of its own, and we all owe Lin Xiao one today. Furthermore, we’re all present in the matter between Lin Xiao and your senior brother, and we will only speak the truth.”

Lin Yun didn’t say anything right from the start, but this gave him a high opinion of many of the holy land disciples. Back at the Black Tortoise Vault, they naturally used various means to obtain as much as possible and hoped that he would die there. But they didn’t backstab him now and even stood out for him. Regardless of their strength, this showed Lin Yun a clear view of the grace of the holy land disciples.

Compared to them, Ji Lingfeng was more impolite, and he sneered, “Huang Xuanyi, if I remember correctly, your eyes were blinded by Brother Lin, right? I never realized how shameless you can be. You dare to be arrogant before Elder Gu, but why didn’t you stand out when the Fire God General robbed you earlier? In a nutshell, you’re a piece of trash, and I’m embarrassed to stand out to talk about you. Which of us here can’t crush you with a finger? Do you really think you’re someone?”

“Ji Lingfeng, don’t push it!” Huang Xuanyi roared.

“What can you do to me even if I push it? You’re disgusting to look at. Elder Gu is a Quasi-Saint, and he’s not in a position to kill you. But we’re both of the same generation. So why don’t you fight me instead?” Ji Lingfeng smiled.

Huang Xuanyi immediately cowered upon hearing that, and backed off. Right then, the pinnacle Nirvana Stage from the Ming Cult stepped forth, “What Huang Xuanyi said is a little too much, but he’s not exactly unreasonable. To begin with, those treasures belonged to us, and he just returned them to us. Because he killed a disciple of my Ming Cult, he should pay with his life, not to mention the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.”

There was no change on Lin Yun’s face, but his gaze became colder because the Ming Cult was starting to get on his nerves.

“Lin Xiao has passed the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to me, and I will hand it over to the pavilion master. So you guys can give up on it, since it’s a hot potato in your hands. The Divine Dragon Empire will surely ask for it, and it’s not something we can decide on.” Gu Jun spoke out. He was saying it to pull Lin Yun out of this mess.

Xiao Yuanqi nodded his head, “That’s reasonable. There’s only one Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, and it’s unfair for anyone to have it. It’s safe to put it in the hands of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion while we discuss the ownership over it.”

Hearing what he said, everyone fell silent, representing everyone’s attitude. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect was the head of the six holy lands, and they had great prestige. Most importantly, this was a reasonable solution. After all, the six holy lands couldn’t possibly start a fight over a Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. Even if they ultimately obtained it, they might be unable to keep it.

The faces of the Ming Cult’s disciples were ugly, and the other holy lands stood on Lin Yun’s side. Right then, streaks of light flew over. They were the Quasi-Saints of the six holy lands who had finally rushed over.
