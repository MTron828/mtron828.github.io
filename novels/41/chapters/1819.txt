Chapter 1820 - Black Tortoise Totem

Screams would occasionally resound throughout the passage. As the Profound Lightning Sacred Flames flew over, the floor became covered in charred corpses, and half of the people who charged in first were dead. As for those who survived the bombardment, their faces were covered with shock because the Black Tortoise Underground Palace was no different from hell.

“Charge through the passage!” But anyone who could come here wasn’t a pushover, and each of them was a genius at the Profound Life Stage. There were even some older generations in the Profound Life Stage amongst them.

The chaos lasted for a long time until everything calmed down. Those who could go in have already gone in, and those who couldn’t were dead. When everything calmed down, it was just as Gu Jun said; the bombardment of Profound Lightning Sacred Flame had come to an end.

As a head protruded from the tortoiseshell shield, he formed a seal and the tortoiseshell began to shrink in size after Gu Jun verified that it was safe outside. In the end, it shrunk to the size of a compass upon landing on his hand.

Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua couldn’t help taking a few more glances at the tortoiseshell when they came out.

“It’s just a small toy not worth mentioning.” Gu Jun smiled, fearing that the tortoiseshell might catch their attention. When he swept his gaze at the corpses on the ground, he was thoroughly shocked. Everyone was excited when the gates were opened, and yet so many people lost their lives before they could catch a glimpse of the treasures.

Mei Zihua’s face was pale, and this was the first time he saw such a terrifying scene. After all, they were still alive just a moment ago, and they were dead now. This had a huge impact on his heart.

“Life isn’t easy, and this is how cruel martial dao is.” Gu Jun sighed before he started searching the corpses. After all, there would definitely be some treasures they didn’t keep in their interspatial pouch. It didn’t take long for him to be covered in multiple saint armors, leaving Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua shocked as they looked at Gu Jun as he searched through the corpses. But Lin Yun looked at Gu Jun with approval, and he had to admit this old man was a genius.

Gu Jun kept the various interspatial bracelets, regardless of whether he could break through the restrictions. This way, even if he couldn’t obtain anything in the palace, this would become a decent fortune if he could make it out, making this a worthwhile trip.

“Let’s go.” Several people came forth and reached the vortex at the far end of the passage. It was a bizarre vortex that looked like a light screen, emanating a powerful spatial fluctuation, and Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to enter it first.

A while later when Lin Yun opened his eyes, the scenery before him opened up. This was a spacious land. There were mountains, rivers, and palaces forming ruins that decorated this barren land.

There was a world within the Heavenly Thunder Palace. If these ancient palaces and buildings were undamaged, they would probably look magnificent. But the place was tattered and desolate.

Lin Yun was a little surprised because the differences between the outside of the Heavenly Thunder Palace and the inside were too great.

“How did the Heavenly Thunder Palace end up in this state…?” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

Gu Jun sighed, “The fiends came and attacked, and none of the ancient deities could help. Aside from the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, all the other thirty-six palaces fell in that battle. Even the Heavenly Domain Star was shattered, and the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea that we’re in was called the Heavenly God Sea back then!”

“You know a lot.” Lin Yun nodded his head. But before Gu Jun could explain, Lin Yun followed up, “I know. You only heard about it, and you have nothing to do with the Black Tortoise’s lineage.”

“You’re really smart to know what I’m going to answer.” Gu Jun grinned.

“Brother Lin, can you even find treasures here? This place is so tattered, and I can’t tell if there’s anything out of the ordinary here.” Mei Zihua looked around curiously.

“Who knows? Let’s just look around.” Lin Yun said.

The old man still wanted to say something, but he ultimately kept quiet. Lin Yun inwardly smiled because he roughly knew what the old man wanted to say, and he planned to wait till Gu Jun couldn’t hold it back. He could even roughly guess why Gu Jun was here at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

“Young Master Mei might not know, but most ruins are in this state. If no one came here before, there’s a high chance there might be treasures here.” An Liuyan said.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s look around first.” Lin Yun flew out, and his Sword Heart swept out, scanning the surrounding ruins. Judging from the state of the ruins, he could tell that there was a battle here, and there was even the aura of the Demonspirit Clan lingering here.

The ancient demonspirit again? Lin Yun inwardly pondered because he had interacted with the Demonspirit Clan in the past. They had a high sense of presence in the dark era. There were rumors that the Demonspirit Clan the Nine Emperors sealed were beginning to awaken, and they were quite active in some places.

The Divine Dragon Era might seem flourishing, but there were many hidden threats around, and chaos would descend if they weren’t careful.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun suddenly came to a stop in mid-air. His gaze fell onto a place, and his Sword Heart caught onto a wisp of a bizarre saint aura.

An hour later, when they arrived in this region, there was a huge totem at the plaza. The saint runes on the totem had fallen off, and there were only nine ancient corpses remaining. These corpses were weird, and they seemed to be protecting something while facing the totem.

They seemed to have instantly lost their lives, leaving behind their still standing skeletons. Right then, more people descended on this region, searching for something.

“There’s nothing here…”

“This Black Tortoise Underground Palace is really poor. There’s nothing even after searching for half a day.”

“A bunch of skeletons?! Damn it!” Someone became frustrated and released their dragon origin, sweeping a violent gale in the surroundings.

“Mhm? There’s something weird about this totem!” Someone said, and everyone’s attention was focused on the towering totem.

“This totem should be a sacred artifact of the Black Tortoise’s lineage!”

“Who knows, perhaps the cultivation techniques of the Black Tortoise’s lineage are recorded on it.”

“There’s a possibility. So we don’t have to compete for it, and we can just make a copy each.” Everyone’s gazes became heated, looking at the totem.

“Not good, retreat!” But Gu Jun's face suddenly changed, stopping Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua before they quickly retreated.
