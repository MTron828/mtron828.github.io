Chapter 1063 - Different Splendour For Every People

Once again, Lin Yun clashed with the Divine Blood Fruit. But unlike the previous time, this time was more dangerous. After all, he couldn’t afford to leave anymore because he had to comprehend the Sword of the Beginning.

Even if he didn’t end up dying, he would lose his sight. The loss of sight wasn’t something that Lin Yun could accept. To a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator, the eyes weren't just needed to differentiate objects but also for examining dao rhyme. The eyes contained part of one’s spirit, which would be a huge loss to Lin Yun.

In the blink of an eye, seven days passed as Lin Yun tried to comprehend the profundity of the Sword of the Beginning. He was able to comprehend most of the sword ray, but he still couldn’t grasp its essence. Anytime he swung his sword to test his comprehension, he would light up the abyss with his sword ray. He had reached the point where the light seemed to last for an eternity, which meant that he achieved the Light of the Beginning.

“With my current attainment in the sword, it’s weird that I still can’t grasp the essence…” Lin Yun was anxious. He knew that a god couldn’t be looked at directly, but he really wanted to look at the god again to see the sword.

Lin Yun was a prideful person, so he was happy that his attainment in the sword was famous throughout the Heavenly Path. So he was getting frustrated with his setback. If he was unsuccessful, he would lose his life to the Divine Blood Fruit.

Right at this moment, a tender voice sounded out in Lin Yun’s mind, “The gods have witnessed countless splendors, like the rising and setting of the sun or the destruction of worlds. Everyone sees a different scene, so everyone has their own Sword of the Beginning. Death to those who mimic and life to those who learn this!”

When that voice echoed out, Lin Yun was startled. He threw up a mouthful of blood as he was struck by the Divine Blood Fruit. Swinging his Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun pushed the two holy spirits to the limit. He suddenly realized that the voice belonged to the ice phoenix.

“Indeed, everyone has their own splendor. It looks like I fell into an endless cycle. I have to find my own splendor and condense it into my sword. The simplest ones are probably the sunrise and sunset. Hmmm, I still don’t have many experiences with sunsets… Oh, that’s right, sunrise! That’s the most glorious moment I’ve seen!” Lin Yun suddenly gained an insight.

Crushing the saint pellet in his mouth to replenish his vitality, Lin Yun emitted a dazzling sword ray from his body. At the same time, the aura from his two holy spirits began to surge. At the same time, a flute sounded out. The song was coming from Yue Weiwei who sensed Lin Yun’s chaotic emotions.

If someone was here, they would notice that the Demonic Astral Flowers in Lin Yun’s aura oceans were beginning to blaze. Additionally, his body was turning glossy like a jade. At this moment, an unrivaled aura exploded out of Lin Yun as his sword ray dyed the surroundings red. The once dead abyss looked like it was coming to life.

“That’s right, the brightest splendor that I have ever witnessed was with the sunrise. This is the Sword of the Beginning that solely belongs to me!” With his aura at its pinnacle, Lin Yun’s sword ray tore through the seven holy spirits. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

His attack made him look like a deity as his blazing sword ray shined brightly. His attack was so strong that the Divine Blood Fruit let out a terrified scream. Knowing that this was the perfect opportunity, Lin Yun charged at the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Come here!” When Lin Yun got close to the Divine Blood Fruit, he took out the bottle that Yue Weiwei gave him. As his origin circulated through it, the bottle unleashed a powerful suction force that swallowed the Divine Blood Fruit.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun removed the bandage covering his eyes. When he opened his eyes, his pupils shined brightly. Not only did he recover from his injuries entirely, but his eyes were so sharp that they could even pierce through space. If anyone saw this, they wouldn’t believe that Lin Yun was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“What powerful strength! I bet I can face Empyreans or Divine Core Realm experts now.” Lin Yun was shocked. It sounded crazy, but he was right. If he managed to plant the seed of fear in the heart of someone, he could crush their will and defeat them instantly. This was the benefit of refining the sword ray. It was all thanks to the Time-Turning Mirror that he obtained the Divine Blood Fruit and saw the sword ray.

Then again, grasping the Sword of the Beginning was more important than either of these encounters. After all, the will of transcendent geniuses was terrifying, so planting the seed of fear in their hearts was a new method for Lin Yun to rely on. But he might not even need to resort to that method. His sword was so strong that other cultivators might not be able to face it head-on.

“I should talk to Yue Weiwei.” Then, Lin Yun flew up to the top of the cliff with the sound of Yue Weiwei’s flute continuing to play. In the blink of an eye, he exited the abyss and was greete by the sight of Yue Weiwei playing her flute under the moonlight.

Yue Weiwei was as beautiful as ever as a radiant luster emitted from the strands of her hair. Her eyes were closed, which revealed her pure temperament. She was also wearing her typical red dress that made her aura seem bewitching. All of these features combined made her a true demoness. Lin Yun had to calm himself down to make sure he wasn’t affected by her beauty.

“Big Brother Yun, you succeeded!” Yue Weiwei placed the flute down and smiled with unconcealable joy in his eyes.

“Here, this is for you.” Lin Yun smiled and handed the bottle over.

Yue Weiwei was briefly stunned before she blushed, “Big Brother Yun, I… can’t deny this gift. A Divine Blood Fruit has great meaning to me, so I have to accept this. B-but how am I ever going to repay you…”

“There’s no rush.” Lin Yun smiled at her and proceeded to say, “Let’s talk about everything when we get out of her.”

“Ah? Big Brother Yun, do you have a way out?” Yue Weiwei asked in surprise.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun replied, “I was initially thinking of asking the palace spirit to transport us out, but it looks like there’s no need for that now. This space isn’t stable, so I might be able to cut open a door for us with the Sword of the Beginning.”

“Yeah, you can try to refine the dew when we get out of here. If your physique can resist it, the fortune from the dew might even be greater than the Saint Spiritual Lake,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

When Lin Yun heard the name Saint Spiritual Lake, he was stunned. He had almost forgotten about the lake. Basking in the Saint Spiritual Lake would mean that the final battle would start soon. He had many things to do before then.
