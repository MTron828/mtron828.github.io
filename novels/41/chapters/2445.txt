Chapter 2446 - Heaven Burial, Tian Xuanzi's Heaven!

The Twin Stars from back then were enemies now as Ye Guhan pointed his sword at Tian Xuanzi with murderous intent filling his eyes. On the other hand, Tian Xuanzi looked relaxed with the Golden Dragon Sword.

“Make your move,” Tian Xuanzi said. His wrist trembled, and drew a flower with the sword as they clashed. But surprisingly, they both used the Great Profound Sword Canon, the sword sutra unique to the Sword Sect. Ye Guhan attacked while Tian Xuanzi was on the defense.

Tian Xuanzi looked casual in the fight, as though he was strolling through a park. Compared to him, Ye Guhan’s sword aura was domineering, but he couldn’t inflict any harm on Tian Xuanzi no matter how hard he tried. It was even more unbelievable because Tian Xuanzi’s Great Profound Sword Canon was stronger than Ye Guhan.

“Who would've thought that Tian Xuanzi’s Great Profound Sword Canon is even stronger than Ye Guhan?”

“The holy master is using the sword canon to slap the Radiant Sword Saint’s face!”

“The holy master has such high attainment in the path as a swordsman. He now has some of Yu Qingfeng's grace.” No one knew what Tian Xuanzi was thinking and only felt that Tian Xuanzi was trying to embarrass the Radiant Sword Saint.

Lin Yun’s face changed with a cold light flashing in his eyes.

“Lin Yun, don’t move. Listen to me!” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s voice resounded in Lin Yun’s ears, making Lin Yun listen seriously.

“Holy Master, please speak.” Lin Yun replied, recollecting his murderous intent.

“Tian Xuanzi’s means are the Great Profound Sword Canon and Profound Sky Canon. He has already reached the peak with the Great Profound Sword Canon, completed through another means despite the lack of two peaks. You have to be careful with that.

“As for the Profound Sky Canon, he has perfected it, not to mention that he even manifested the Profound Sky Universe, which is unbelievable. Even the person who created this cultivation technique failed, and it was only possible in theory. Not to mention that he managed to fuse the two cultivation techniques completely. But it’s fortunate that he has only just started to merge them and hasn't reached a high level in it.”

Lin Yun was shocked, listening to what the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said. But he wasn’t surprised because the Profound Sky Sword Canon must be given to him by Ye Guhan through the permit of their master. Likewise, his senior brother also received the Profound Sky Canon. Perhaps they have discussed the possibility of combining them a long time ago.

“He also has a high attainment in Space Dao. I was at a disadvantage in our fight. But that’s not the main problem. He must have a treasure that allows him to alternate between reality and illusion. Initially, I thought it was because he reached a high level in Space Dao, but that didn’t seem to be the case. He must’ve used a treasure to achieve the same effect. The moment he uses it, he will only leave behind a shadow in the real world, and all your attacks will become useless against him. The only flaw is the time between alternating his state, and you have to catch that flaw, or it will be useless.”

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that. He only had two options to destroy Tian Xuanzi’s saint origin, and one of them was the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron that’s still in the Heavenly Barren Realm. The other was the book the Iris Sword Saint gave him that could kill a deity. Back then, when the Iris Sword Saint slew a deity, he had all seven Sovereign Divine Runes with a cultivation at the pinnacle of a Great Saint.

There was a massive gap between him and the Iris Sword Saint, but Tian Xuanzi wasn’t a deity. With four Sovereign Divine Runes, it should be enough for him to inflict heavy injuries on the latter. The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s information was crucial; his trump cards might have failed without it.

“The flaw is hard to grab onto, and I only managed to grab it once using my saint dao and forbidden technique to injure him. My saint origin might be damaged, but his saint origin is also damaged. He can only bring out fifty percent of his strength!” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master gave Lin Yun a crucial piece of information.

Tian Xuanzi wasn’t uninjured like he appeared to be and could only bring out fifty percent of his strength. Even if he overperformed, he could only bring out sixty percent, at best.

“Senior, how are you comparable to the three holy masters if you can only unleash fifty percent of your strength?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“If the three join forces, they won’t be able to last more than fifty moves in my hands.”

Lin Yun fell silent because the Divine Phoenix Holy Master and Tian Xuanzi were on a different level in comparison to other Great Saints. Even if they could only use fifty percent of their strength, they could still easily defeat the holy masters of the other three holy lands. That was also understandable because Lin Yun and Su Ziyao could be considered myths amongst the younger generation.

“Another question: did Tian Xuanzi have the chance to kill you?” Lin Yun asked in doubt.

“He did, but he said something weird about wanting to reforge the Heavenly Path while I have the chance of reaching the Emperor Realm and Deity Realm. Tian Xuanzi said he wouldn’t bear that sin and told me to live well,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said.

Lin Yun fell silent and was increasingly furious in his heart. Since Tian Xuanzi could be so generous with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, why couldn’t he spare the Radiant Sword Saint?

“Tian Xuanzi never took a step away from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, so he might be hiding something,” Su Ziyao said.

“He’s injured,” Lin Yun said.

“What?” Su Ziyao squinted as Lin Yun told her about what the Divine Phoenix Holy Master told him.

Tian Xuanzi and Ye Guhan were now clashing with the Profound Sky Canon, and it shocked all the Great Saints that Ye Guhan knew the Profound Sky Canon. Aside from having not manifested the Profound Sky Universe, his attainment in it wasn’t inferior to Tian Xuanzi. Many people began to notice that these two must have a good relationship.

“To manifest the Profound Sky Universe, you need a sincere heart. Ye Guhan, you’re not sincere enough,” Tian Xuanzi smiled from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne and easily knocked Ye Guhan back with his sword.

At the same time, the Great Saints in the Sword Sect’s faction managed to knock the dragon clan’s swords back and ganged up on Tian Xuanzi.

“Great! Let me see if there are any talents amongst the Great Saints besides the Divine Phoenix Holy Master!” Tian Xuanzi faced seven enemies by himself and still looked casual. But he didn’t step away from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne throughout the process. Even if he left, he would be within the range of the throne.

A hundred moves later, Tian Xuanzi swung his hand and returned the dragon clan’s swords to the throne. When the swords returned to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, the throne released a powerful dragon aura that suppressed the Great Saints ganging up on him and immobilizing them.

As he clasped his hands together, Tian Xuanzi brought out the Profound Sky Universe. The starry sky behind him was pierced through as he gave everyone a feeling that he was overlooking the entire Kunlun Realm on the throne. As seven moons combined and Tian Xuanzi pushed his palm forth, his palm gave off a feeling like a universe was blooming from his palm.

This attack made the Great Saints attacking Tian Xuanzi throw out a mouthful of blood and retreated with pale faces. When they raised their heads to look at Tian Xuanzi, their eyes were filled with despair because the Profound Sky Universe was comparable to a deity spirit martial technique.

“See it now?” Tian Xuanzi smiled at Ye Guhan before his gaze fell onto Lin Yun. He smiled, “Flower Burial, the Radiant Sword Saint saved you back at the Heavenly Barren Battlefield while Ye Guhan saved you back at the Unholy Sea. I wonder who can save you now? Come with me and we will observe the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation together!”

Tian Xuanzi reached out, wanting to get a hold of Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun was prepared and left Su Ziyao, barely dodging this attack.

“Impressive speed!” Tian Xuanzi ignored Su Ziyao and smiled while reaching out to Lin Yun again. This time, he grabbed the entire space and distorted it in his palm.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he discovered he was immobilized. But in the critical moment, the flute music resounded again and turned into a nine-colored aurora light that intertwined on Lin Yun, obstructing the distorted space for him.

Lin Yun took this opportunity to break free. When he turned in a specific direction, he saw Mu Xueling playing the flute on a mountain.

“Saint Elder?” Lin Yun was surprised. Not only was he surprised but also shocked that Mu Xueling played the Nichang Dress Song, forming the nine-colored celestial robe for him. But Tian Xuanzi charged forth before he could think more about it, and Lin Yun could only execute the Dragon-Phoenix Sword.

But Tian Xuanzi would quickly resolve his attacks whenever he attacked, forcing him to retreat.

“Pretty good sword technique you have there. You must’ve comprehended it recently, right?” Tian Xuanzi smiled. Ten moves later, the Dragon-Phoenix Sword was entirely resolved by Tian Xuanzi, destroying the dragon and phoenix phenomenon coiling around the sword.

Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood and took a few steps back. But the aurora light from the sky supported him.

“Not enough. How will you help your master and reforge the Heavenly Path?” Tian Xuanzi shook his head and coldly said, “Since you’re not strong enough, you can only die!”

With a wave of his hand, the seven swords behind the throne released a vibration and manifested into seven divine dragons that flew forward. In the path of those swords, space was pierced through, and the power could even tear apart the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique.

“Junior Brother!” Ye Guhan and others were anxious but couldn’t move since the Profound Sky Universe injured them.

But in the critical moment, eight paintings flew out from Lin Yun, hovering behind him. The eight paintings were the eight ominous beasts. When they combined into a painting, a sword hovered above the universe.

At this moment, Lin Yun released his Sovereign Constellation, which unleashed a powerful aura, shocking everyone. At the same time, the Flower Burial Sword in his hand also released the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact, unleashing the full power of the Sovereign Constellation.

When Lin Yun swung his sword, the seven saint swords were sent flying back. When the swords fell, they plunged into the ground, trembling.

This scene left the Great Saints in the Profound Sky Sect’s faction shocked as they took in a deep breath with disbelief in their eyes.

“How is this possible...” The Light Subduing Great Saint was shocked that Lin Yun held back in their fight.

“What Sovereign Constellation is that?”

“I’ve never seen it before...”

“It’s not created by him, right?”

“What kind of monster is he?” All the Great Saints were shocked. After all, comprehending a Sovereign Constellation was tough, not to mention creating one. Even in the Kunlun Realm’s prime, such an accomplishment was unheard of.

“As expected of someone Yu Qingfeng is willing to make a move for. You’re truly extraordinary. What’s the name of this constellation?” Tian Xuanzi asked.

Wiping the blood off his lips, Lin Yun said indifferently, “Heaven Burial, Tian Xuanzi's Heaven!”
