Chapter 1170 - Limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm!

Lin Yun reached the last step of his breakthrough, showing everyone how tough it was. It was clear to everyone why many geniuses would die during the process. If they were the ones in Lin Yun’s position, they would be dead upon facing the first tribulation.

When the sea of Demonic Astral Flowers disappeared, the ninth layer of heaven appeared once more with the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise Constellations shining gorgeously.

As starlight shined down from the sky like a waterfall, it enveloped Lin Yun in silver light. The starlight had condensed into a spiritual spring behind the Spirit Astral Mountain before pouring into the lake that had already been dried up.

The sect master stood with his hands behind his back as he raised his head to look at the silver waterfall pouring down from the sky. It was beautiful. Most of the energy from the waterfall was pouring down at the Spirit Astral Mountain, with a small portion entering Lin Yun’s body.

This was a gift from heaven and earth, and no one could imagine what great benefits it would bring to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. In the future, they would easily be able to break apart the ninth layer of heaven on the Spirit Astral Mountain. In a way, Lin Yun greatly increased the foundation of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

The disciples on the shore were completely dumbfounded by this scene because they had never witnessed such a shocking scene before.

“Holy shit, is that a genuine waterfall?”

“Starlight from the ninth layer of heaven… don’t tell me there’s really a heavenly river in the 36th layer of heaven…”

“The 36th layer of heaven is simply a legend to us. We’re already fortunate that we can witness this scene.”

“Senior Brother Lin has successfully reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. But can he really be considered a disciple of our Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

“Why not? Senior Brother Lin admitted back in the Heavenly Aquatic Island that he was a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, not to mention that he even put his life in danger to save senior sister from Lei Ying.”

“Will he represent the sect to partake in the ranking battle?” An uproar broke out among the disciples after a brief silence.

After all, it hadn’t been long since Lin Yun came to the sect. He had only been in the sect for six months, and he didn’t look like someone who would stay in the sect for long. So none of them were sure about Lin Yun’s sense of belonging to the sect. Then again, they were proud of Lin Yun since Lin Yun had successfully reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.

But if Lin Yun didn’t consider himself a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, then their pride would be a little awkward. Then again, after what happened on the Heavenly Aquatic Island, everyone couldn’t conceal the excitement on their faces.

The starlight waterfall lasted for an hour before it gradually died down. When the last strand of starlight descended onto Lin Yun, the crack in the sky slowly closed up and disappeared.

With sunlight shining down on Lin Yun once more, everyone realized that it was still daytime. The darkness was just a phenomenon created when the heavens cracked. When Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes, two golden lights radiated from his pupils.

Sighing, Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling. Then, he joined his hands together in front of his chest and the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans began to blaze with flames. As he stood at the summit of the Spirit Astral Mountain, the light he emitted was so dazzling that it made many people close their eyes.

“The limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm!” An exclamation broke out among the disciples because they felt fortunate they witnessed the legendary limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm in their lifetime and the birth of a legend. Even many years later, this scene was still deeply engraved in the minds of all the disciples.

“He really succeeded!” Jiang Lichen gritted his teeth, wondering where this monster came from. He was gone for only half a year, and he was shocked to find such a strong contestant as soon as he came back. At this moment, he didn’t feel any pride as the chief disciple.

He felt embarrassed when he remembered the way he showed off to Ye Ziling. At this moment, he really wanted to dig a hole and hide his face in it.

Furthermore, he couldn’t even feel any sense of existence right now. Earlier on, Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang ridiculed him and embarrassed him. But now, they couldn’t even be bothered to bat an eye at him because they were only focused on Lin Yun.

“Hahaha. That’s truly something worthy of someone who had climbed the Sword Saint Mountain!” Feng Zhang’s face was filled with excitement. “If I hadn’t bet with him earlier, he might not even be able to reach the summit of the Sword Saint Mountain. If he didn’t ascend the Sword Saint Mountain, he might not have been able to achieve the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

Liu Qingyan rolled his eyes when he heard what Feng Zhang said, “Stop finding ways to compliment yourself. Why do I remember that a certain someone was slapped to the point of nearly kneeling on the ground?”

“Let’s not mention the past,” smiled Feng Zhang awkwardly.

“Senior Brother Lin is really handsome!” Wang Yuruo’s eyes were shining on her red face. She could feel her heart beating wildly while she shook Ye Ziling’s hand in excitement, “Senior Sister, Senior Brother Lin really managed to achieve it!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Ziling was feeling conflicted but she still smiled with admiration for the youth standing at the summit of the Spirit Astral Mountain. At this moment, Lin Yun had fully displayed the grace of a swordsman. She was proud that she could have Lin Yun as a friend.

One by one, Demonic Astral Flowers flew out of Lin Yun’s body until all 49 revealed themselves. Each Demonic Astral Flowers had turned gold like a bright sun full of vitality. When Lin Yun looked at them carefully, he could even smell a floral fragrance coming from them.

The 49 Demonic Astral Flowers revolved around Lin Yun as the ancient runes formed a natural and complicated array. The array was extremely profound since each of the Demonic Astral Flowers looked like an array themselves. It was like an overlap of 49 arrays.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun smiled and allowed a Demonic Astral Flower to land on his palm. But to his surprise, the delicate-looking flower had the weight of a mountain.

“This is…?” With surprise flashing in his eyes, he noticed that the flower bud of the Demonic Astral Flower had changed. The flower bud was blazing with golden flames that released a terrifying power. The destructive prowess had reached a level that not even Lin Yun, whose physique was comparable to a saint artifact, dared to belittle.

He couldn’t begin to imagine how powerful it would be if all 49 Demonic Astral Flowers exploded at the same time. Just the thought of it enveloped Lin Yun in fear. The limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm was too profound and it appeared that Lin Yun had much more he needed to learn about it.

Then, he made the Demonic Astral Flowers return to his body. After recalling everything back into his body, he turned to look at Luo Hua. The latter was still donned in white clothes as she raised her head upon sensing his gaze. Lin Yun couldn’t see her face, but he had a feeling that she was smiling beneath her veil.

Luo Hua actually smiled before she left. This made Lin Yun exclaim because Luo Hua gave off an ethereal temperament. Then, Lin Yun turned his head over and saw Lil’ Purple looking at him with disdain as she stood on a mountain.

Lin Yun smiled because he knew that Lil’ Purple would definitely come despite what she said. She said that she wouldn’t come, but she still snuck over.

Lin Yun then retracted his gaze and turned to look at everyone he was acquainted with, nodding his head at all of them before flying over to the sect master, “Disciple Lin Yun, greets the sect master.”

Lin Yun had already expressed his attitude towards the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect with his words. But the additional confirmation made everyone in the sect emotional as they cheered. Falling to one knee, their voices echoed out, “We congratulate Senior Brother Lin for reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm!”
