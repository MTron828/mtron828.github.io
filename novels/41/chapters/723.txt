Chapter 724 - Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword

Lin Yun was greatly surprised that these two abilities surpassed his imagination. After reaching the Yin-Yang stage, he could sense that his origin energy had transformed completely.

Four hours later, Lin Yun finally regained his strength and stood up. His gaze was deep, but his eyes were still burning with rage as he looked at Skymound City’s direction.

This isn’t enough! Lin Yun’s expression became sinister with a killing aura surging in his pupils. If he was going to make a move, he wanted to ensure that he could kill all seven geniuses. Now that he had reached the lesser Yin-Yang stage, it was time for him to train the Overlord Sword and Flicking Divine Finger.

The Overlord Sword had nine forms and every time he succeeded in learning one form, his fighting strength would increase. But this sword technique was too overbearing and his cultivation had to keep up if he wanted to practice it.

In the past, he had only successfully learned the first three moves, but it was different now that he had reached the Yin-Yang stage. As for the Flicking Divine Finger, it was a secret technique left behind by the Iris Sword Saint and was divided into five stages. He was now in the second stage, Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit. With his current cultivation, he could confidently reach Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword.

“Okay, I will work on the Overlord Sword first and then the Flicking Divine Finger.” Lin Yun made up his mind quickly and wasted no time. The Overlord Sword was separated into Thunderbolt Slash, Solar Slash, Big Bang, Breaking Dawn, Blood Suppression, Tai’a Slash, Limitless Radiance, Myriad Ages, and Overlord.

Each form was a powerful attack and Lin Yun could turn the tables around with them. In the past, he had only learned three moves. However, his understanding of the Overlord Sword was stronger now.

Big Bang was already terrifying enough, so there was no question that Breaking Dawn would be even more powerful. Then again, this was only if he could grasp the true intent behind it. In a flash, Lin Yun landed on the center of the lake with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand.

“Breaking Dawn…” It wasn’t hard to comprehend Breaking Dawn. As the name implied, he had to dispel the darkness of the world with the radiance of the sword. A brief moment later, Lin Yun drew his sword and began to practice on the lake. He was searching for the intent of Breaking Dawn.

Lin Yun continued to practice it again and again. Occasionally, a brilliant radiance would come from the lake. After practicing over a thousand times, his domineering aura made the lake start boiling.

“Hmmm, that’s not right. This is too much power. My sword should represent a rising sun.”

“Ugh, this isn’t right either. I have to dispel all the darkness in the world…”

“The darkness is too corrosive. This move isn’t the same as Thunderbolt Slash, so I don’t need to use sword intent to manifest the darkness.” For cultivators, practicing sword techniques was a boring thing to do, especially for a profound sword technique.

But Lin Yun was completely submerged in it. His comprehension was shocking and he could implant any martial technique in his mind. Others might need days or months, but he could learn it quickly and easily get it to greater mastery or even complete mastery.

If Lin Yun was only aiming for greater mastery, it wouldn’t be difficult for Lin Yun even if it was the Overlord Sword. But he wanted to grasp its intent so that he could bring it to complete mastery or even the manifestation stage.

Three days later, Lin Yun swung his sword out, unleashing a dazzling brilliance from his sword that landed on the surface of the lake. The lake instantly exploded, forming a huge crater while his sword intent lingered. But when the crater closed up and formed a vortex, a water tornado shot into the sky.

“Too gentle…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. This sword was indeed a little too gentle. It was only about 80% stronger than Big Bang. If it was an ordinary sword technique, it would be great to have 50%. But for the Overlord Sword, it was a failure if it wasn’t 100%.

“Breaking Dawn, how am I going to break through the darkness with this? The light will get consumed by the darkness instead…” Lin Yun shook his head as the water tornado slowly dissipated and filled the crater. It was just as he had said as his sword ray was completely consumed by the darkness.

If he wanted to break through the darkness, he would have to do his very best even when facing death. Otherwise, how could he possibly fight others?

Drawing his sword once more, Lin Yun poured his rage and insanity into it. As his sword aura reached a limit, flames began to blaze on the surface of his body, turning him into a huge fireball. He was radiating light and heat, which made him look like a madman.

When his sword ray descended, boundless flames exploded with a radiance that made everything in the world tremble in fear. As the water began to evaporate, the steam made the entire area look like a fairyland. When the steam disappeared, Lin Yun sheathed his sword with a satisfied smile on his face.

There was no ripple on the surface of the water, so many people would doubt that there was even an attack. Only those who were keen would notice that the lake water sank by three-inch.

If I empower this attack with Azure Dragon Sword Aura, it'll be even more terrifying. Time to practice the Flicking Divine Finger… Lin Yun made a plan as he closed his eyes and sat down. Ever since Lin Yun reached the Yin-Yang stage, his strength was growing at an absurd rate.

After reaching the lesser Yin-Yang stage, not only did his martial souls awaken, but his eyesight had also changed. All of his techniques that were restricted by his cultivation made a breakthrough, especially the Overlord Sword and Flicking Divine Finger.

A few days later, the lake level was still the same. Only those with meticulous thoughts could discover the reason. Lin Yun was seated and his ten fingers had turned into emerald-like jade, gently tapping the surface of the lake. As he did this, a sword hum emitted from his body.

The sound of the sword hum was different from saintly music though. His fingers gradually slowed down to the point that they froze and the buzzing became heavier. Every time his finger hit the lake, a water geyser would rise into the sky like sharp blades.

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword! Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and flicked his finger. A silver sword ray instantly shot out. At that moment, Lin Yun’s hair and clothes fluttered in the wind.

Lin Yun also soared into the sky as the surface of the lake exploded. It was as if an invisible pair of hands were tearing the lake apart. The cut was clean as the lake water fell like a waterfall. This was the power of the Flicking Divine Finger in the third stage.

Then, Lin Yun’s palm landed at the edge of the cliff where the crimson cocoon was. At this moment, Lin Yun could sense that the heartbeat had gotten louder with more brimming vitality.

He had no idea if Lil’ Red was dead, but at least this meant that it was a lot better than before. He knew that the crimson cocoon would break sooner or later, but Lin Yun had no idea what Lil’ Red would turn into. Storing the crimson cocoon, Lin Yun waved his sleeve and looked at a city in the distance.

He was looking at Skymound City, one of the seven main cities in Thunder Prefecture. It had been ten days since the explosion but it felt like a lifetime for Lin Yun. That day was terrible and from that experience, he had understood what being shameless was.

“Geniuses?” Lin Yun sneered as he looked at that city. His smile was so cold that even the lake started to turn into ice.

Looks like it’s time for me to make a trip to Skymound City. Lin Yun’s figure flashed and disappeared into the night.
