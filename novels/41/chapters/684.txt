Chapter 685 - Frivolous, Arrogant

Seeing the killing aura in Lin Yun’s eyes, Tang Ying grew even more furious, especially after sensing the cultivators in the surroundings. “You bastard. You’re about to know the difference between someone in the greater Yin-Yang stage and the Yang stage. If it weren’t for the fact that I don’t want you to die so easily, I would’ve stepped on you and made you beg for your life!”

He believed that he could suppress anyone beneath the Yin-Yang stage, even if they were a genius. In his mind, as long as Lin Yun hadn’t reached the Yin-Yang stage, he would be easily crushed.

Consumed by his rage, Tang Ying moved. He took a step forward and poured his origin energy into his legs. With a gentle leap, the ground trembled as he arrived before Lin Yun. With a brutal and overbearing smile, Tang Ying threw his palm out at Lin Yun. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He didn’t use his sword, but the crimson glow around his palm was like a crimson sword. When his palm landed, it had the sharpness of sword intent while complementing the flaw of sword intent at the same time. He wanted to crush Lin Yun into meat paste with his palm to make up for the humiliation of how the middle-aged man from the Ironblood Sword Gate died. He wanted to use an even more brutal method to kill Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun calmly faced Tang Ying’s palm. Two sharp lights shot out from his pupils as he intended to face Tang Ying head-on. When the palm and fist clashed together, the collision created a dazzling light along with a terrifying shockwave that spread out.

The ground beneath their feet exploded as countless cracks began to spread out. Under the explosion, the rocks and trees in the surroundings were reduced to ashes. This was a shocking collision.

This shocked the bystanders. After all, Lin Yun was actually capable of withstanding the attack of an expert in the greater Yin-Yang stage. But Tang Ying was even more shocked. After all, his palm was a secret technique that could kill someone in the lesser Yin-Yang stage.

However, the youth who was only in the greater Yang stage could face him head-on. After briefly being shocked, flames blazed in Tang Ying’s eyes as he smiled eerily, “You have quite a bit of secrets on you. I’ll capture you later and torture you to get all of your secrets. Everything that belongs to you will be mine!”

Killing intent and rage surged even more furiously in his pupils as he clashed with Lin Yun once more. From afar, the lightning and crimson mist emitted from their clash was terrifying. The phenomenon continued to spread out, which caused everyone’s shock to rise.

Lin Yun didn’t look like a youth because of how strong he was. Tang Ying couldn’t believe this because he was in the greater Yin-Yang stage and his origin energy had been refined by Yin and Yang. He was confident that he could defeat ten cultivators in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. But he noticed that he wasn’t able to take Lin Yun down even after exchanging almost ten moves.

“This is it!” Tang Ying roared from humiliation since he couldn’t capture Lin Yun, not to mention stepping on Lin Yun beneath his feet. As Tang Ying’s pupils grew even redder, the sword ray around him became even more terrifying.

From their exchange, everyone understood why the Ironblood Sword Gate was able to rule Flamedragon Hill for so long. Not only did they have a strong foundation and a powerful force backing them up, the strength displayed by Tang Ying was a lot stronger than ordinary cultivators in the greater Yin-Yang stage.

Tang Ying’s attack was a secret technique. But clearly, it was related to the force behind the white-clothed youth.

“Is that it?” Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform fearlessly and mobilized four dragon runes. As lightning began to crackle on the surface of his body, he charged forward with lightning and his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery gathered onto his palm.

Without using his sword, this was the strongest power he could exert. After all, he had sworn that he would never draw his sword again if he couldn’t take his revenge.

Along with another earth-shattering explosion, Lin Yun and Tang Ying clashed together in the sky. When they landed on the ground, they charged at each other immediately like two ferocious beasts fighting.

“Who’s this youth? What powerful sword intent. He actually managed to suppress Tang Ying’s sword intent!”

“That youth looks familiar for some reason. His appearance, clothes, sword box, and young age…it’s him! He’s Flower Burial Lin Yun. That’s the guy that defeated numerous geniuses from the various clans in the Death Auction not long ago. He was the one who competed with Qing Ruoyou for the Divine Indigo Ratiantstone and clashed with Xiang Tianhe.”

“No wonder…” Everyone finally understood why Lin Yun was so strong and they couldn’t help feeling emotional. After all, everyone had heard of Lin Yun’s matter. But he hadn’t shown himself ever since he destroyed the Profound Note Bell. So no one had expected that he would show up at Flamedragon Hill and fight a terrifying opponent in the greater Yin-Yang stage.

“This fellow is a ruthless person!” Right at this moment, everyone knew what a genuine monstrous genius meant.

The two were like ferocious beasts, one enveloped in crimson mist and the other enveloped in lightning, but both were surging with sword intent. This left a shock in Tang Ying’s eyes as he noticed that Lin Yun’s physique was like a beast. Not only was Lin Yun fine facing his attacks, but Tang Ying even had blood dripping down from his lips.

They were both facing each other head-on, but Lin Yun had clearly held the upperhand now that his physique had undergone a transformation. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent at complete mastery had suppressed his crimson mist entirely.

“Damn it! Enough!” Tang Ying was even more enraged since he was suffering injuries, but Lin Yun was still fine. Then, Tang Ying drew an emerald sword covered with runes.

This made Lin Yun’s heart beat wildly as he retreated. This sword was at least a high ranked cosmic artifact, but it was refined with an evil method. Lin Yun was sensitive towards it because he was a spiritualist. Now that he couldn’t use the Flower Burial Sword, he had to be more cautious.

“You want to leave now? Too late! I’ve been nourishing my sword for the past decade and I’ll use you as a sacrifice for my sword!” Tang Ying sneered. At his age, he naturally had some trump cards and this emerald sword was one of them. But he wouldn’t use it casually as it would be weakened every time he used it.

In the next second, the crimson mist spread out and black runes appeared on Tang Ying’s face. When he swung his emerald sword down, the sky turned dark.

Fear filled everyone’s eyes from this dangerous attack. When Lin Yun sensed the dangerous aura, he mobilized the five dragon runes with lightning crackling on his body and dodged. Tang Ying’s attack landed where Lin Yun was previously standing and left a deep crater.

“I told you that you’re going to die today! Someone in the lesser Yang stage dares to fight me? You must be courting death!” Tang Ying’s confidence surged when he saw how powerful his attack was.

Everyone instantly knew that Tang Ying’s sword must have been refined with a unique method, making his artifact a forbidden artifact. At full power, it could boost his strength greatly. This made the spectators sigh.

The spectators thought it was too shameless for Tang Ying to use a forbidden artifact against a cultivator in the Yang stage. Therefore, everyone pitied Lin Yun. Additionally, the Ironblood Sword Gate had been a bully for many years. So they naturally wished that someone could kill Tang Ying.

But looking at this situation right now, they weren’t optimistic for Lin Yun anymore. Lin Yun narrowed his eyes as he continued to dodge the incoming attacks, waiting for the opportunity to turn the tables around.

“Stinking brat. Weren't you arrogant earlier? Let me teach you a lesson! Do you dare to take my sword? Aren’t you carrying a sword box? Draw your sword and fight me!” Tang Ying wore a smug as he continued to swing his sword. This was the situation that he wanted – to suppress Lin Yun entirely.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he could sense that the sword had weakened in comparison to before.

He then continued to probe and noticed that Tang Ying wasn’t able to do anything to the flaws that he had revealed on purpose. This made him realize that this forbidden artifact has been weakened.

This was the perfect moment for him. Without any hesitation, a dragon roar echoed out from within Lin Yun’s body as he summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor.

In the next second, the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest glowed as the dragon runes came to life. Then, thick armor covered Lin Yun’s body as a thick bolt of lightning soared into the sky.

After reaching the fourth stage in the Azure Dragon Enneaform, the Azure Dragon Battle Armor was a lot stronger than before. When he took a step out, he released a dazzling brilliance as if he was about to tear the air apart.

Clenching his right hand, the lightning converged into a dragon claw that clashed with Tang Ying’s sword. Tang Ying lost his grip on his sword and threw up a mouthful of blood. But that wasn’t all Lin Yun’s fist managed to do.

The force from the fist drilled into Tang Ying’s body and blood spread out on his clothes. Along with the crack of a bone, the crimson mist and lightning dispersed to reveal Tang Ying’s caved in chest. Finally, he flew out from the impact.

Lin Yun relied on his cultivation in the greater Yang stage to defeat an elder from the Ironblood Sword Gate in the greater Yin-Yang stage. And he did all of this without relying on his sword.
