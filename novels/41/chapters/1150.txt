Chapter 1151 - Fleeting Cloud!

To the surprise of everyone present, Lin Yun brought out two holy spirits. The phenomenon created by his holy spirit martial technique was far greater than the phenomenon of Luo Kui’s holy spirit.

Anyone could tell the difference between the two holy spirit martial techniques. If Lin Yun and Luo Kui’s cultivation were the same, Luo Kui would even instantly lose his life.

Lin Yun was relying on his physique, but he was now using his origin energy to fight.

WIth a roar, six Demonic Astral Flowers bloomed in each of Lin Yun’s aura oceans as his might started to increase.

“My heavens! That’s 24 Demonic Astral Flowers! How is that possible?!”

“Since when did the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect have such a terrifying genius?” Everyone was completely stunned by the number of Demonic Astral Flowers Lin Yun had in his body. It was already heaven-defying enough that Lin Yun possessed two holy spirits, not to mention Demonic Astral Flowers.

“This… Senior Brother Lin…” Liu Yuan’s jaw dropped. He finally understood why Lin Yun was so confident.

Ye Ziling was also shocked because this was the first time she heard Lin Yun addressing himself as a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Others didn’t know, but she knew that Lin Yun was only supposed to stay in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for a year. Since he was just a passerby, there was no need for him to be concerned with the life and death of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

However, Lin Yun claimed himself as a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was important to her, which was why she had a bad impression of Lin Yun. She assumed that he didn’t care about the sect. But this monster, who she would one day look up to, was causing her to change her opinion.

Lin Yun pushed his cultivation to the limit, colliding with Luo Kui. An unimaginable collision rang out that made the stone forest tremble violently.

Lin Yun was sent flying from the collision while blood dripped from his lips. He was sent flying by Luo Kui’s attack that shattered his holy spirit martial technique. At the same time, Luo Kui was forced back three steps, which was thoroughly embarrassing for him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Luo Kui was knocked back…”

“Isn’t this a little too crazy?! Isn’t he in the greater Astral Stage?” The demonic cultivators broke into an uproar and began to hesitate if they should retreat. After all, a simple disciple in the Heavenly Soul Realm was already too strong.

Qin Feng also grew anxious because if they continued to fight, the demonic cultivators might lose their conviction to stay. If that happened, he wasn’t confident that he could stop the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party from leaving.

“The Astral Stage doesn’t seem that impressive.” Lin Yun smiled after wiping the blood off his lips as though he wasn’t the one sent flying away.

“Let me see what else you can do!” Luo Kui frowned when he saw Lin Yun unleash his Demonic Astral Flowers once more. He couldn’t treat Lin Yun like a normal person because a normal person would only plant two or three Demonic Astral Flowers in each of their aura oceans.

In terms of origin energy alone, Lin Yun was comparable to some Star Stage or Galaxy Stage demonic cultivators.

If it wasn’t for the amount of Demonic Astral Flower that Lin Yun had, he would have died a long time ago. Luo Kui’s killing intent grew as he poured astral energy into the cold blade. Everyone could tell that he was getting serious.

“Die!” Luo Kui smiled and the crimson dragon python began to radiate even more brightly. In the blink of an eye, it grew to 100 feet.

“Demonic Blood Imprisoning Blade! That’s one of Luo Kui’s strongest attacks…” Many demonic cultivators exclaimed because they didn’t expect Luo Kui to use such a strong attack on someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

It was a pity that Lin Yun ran into someone like Luo Kui before he became an empyrean. After all, the difference between their cultivation was too huge.

“Demonic Blood Imprisoning Blade?—Purgatory Slash!” As Luo Kui took a step forward, he generated a wind full of ghostly howls. Then, he swung his sword while manifesting an even more terrifying phenomenon.

Before the blade even landed on the ground, the ground had already begun to crack with a cloud of dust rising up. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could feel a chill run down his spine because this was the most dangerous moment he had encountered ever since he came to Kunlun Realm.

As Lin Yun’s eyes shined brightly, a dragon roar echoed out. His Azure Dragon Sword Aura manifested into a gigantic dragon coiling around him. At the same time, his sword intent instantly reached the pinnacle of sky sword intent.

Lin Yun emitted the aura of an ancient dragon as his sky sword intent and azure dragon sword aura began to merge.

“Sky sword intent? And at complete mastery?! Wait, why does it feel like he’s already transcended the scope of sky sword intent…” This was the first time the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party had seen Lin Yun using his sword intent without any reservation.

Lin Yun’s quasi-divine firmament sword intent had naturally transcended the scope of sky sword intent. In fact, he was only waiting for his cocooned sword intent to transform into the genuine divine firmament sword intent.

With a dragon coiling around him, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. The spiritual energy in the surroundings began to blaze while the dragon’s pupils radiated with powerful sword intent. At this moment, the aura of his dragon was much stronger than the aura of Luo Kui’s dragon.

Lin Yun’s dragon had practically come to life after absorbing the quasi-divine firmament sword intent. So he easily faced Luo Kui’s sword, sending a terrifying shockwave into the surroundings that everyone was forced to dodge.

Under the shockwave, the stone pillars began to crumble as two figures dashed out of the violent storm. Lin Yun was covered in blood, and the purple-golden dragon runes ultimately managed to take the attack head-on.

But before Lin Yun could stabilize his footing, his eyes flashed sharply because he knew that this was the right opportunity. He knew that Luo Kui still hadn’t brought out his strongest attack.

Ignoring the shock on everyone’s faces, Lin Yun summoned his sword from the sword box. When the Flower Burial Sword flew out, the origin stone tried to escape at the same time. However, Lin Yun forced it to stay put. All of this took place in the blink of an eye, but Qin Feng managed to see it and yelled, “Luo Kui, stop playing around with him. Bring out your constellation, the origin stone is with him!”

Everyone turned to look at Lin Yun with confusion. They didn’t think that Ye Ziling would give Lin Yun the origin stone.

As a cold light flashed through Luo Kui’s eyes, he stopped hesitating and let out a roar. A crimson light manifested into a painting behind him as he decided to put an end to the fight. The painting was Luo Kui’s constellation that he received after reaching the Astral Stage.

When the painting unfolded, the power of the Astral Stage was fully unveiled. Luo Kui didn’t think he would use his constellation because he didn’t want to be humiliated. However, the origin stone was more important than his pride.

“You're out of chances.” Lin Yun said coldly while holding onto his sword. When he drew his sword, he unleashed the first nine swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

In that split second, the sky was filled with sword rays and azure birds that flew all around. Before Luo Kui could unveil his constellation, he was cut into pieces by the night sword rays as everything took place too quickly. Just like that, Luo Kui lost his life.

When Luo Kui’s corpse fell to the ground, the gravity of the situation dawned on the crowd. A Heavenly Soul Realm just killed an Astral Stage!

Everyone turned to look at Lin Yun in shock. It looked like they found someone who was capable of using the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords at the manifestation stage.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun hovered in the air with the might of an immortal.
