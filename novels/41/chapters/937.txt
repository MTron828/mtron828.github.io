Chapter 938 - Cage

As soon as Lin Yun left, the lady broke free from the restriction. However, when she raised her head, Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen. Although Heavenly Soul Realm experts could travel in the air, it was too exhausting for one to travel in that manner. So no one would travel by air unless they were escaping.

The mysterious woman had an extraordinary origin and she had the ability to catch Lin Yun. However, she didn’t make a move. The smile also disappeared from her face as she muttered, “He’s really quick at running.”

Suddenly, two figures flew over from Flamecloud City with kingly auras. If someone from Flamecloud City were here, they would immediately recognize them.

The newcomers were Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen. They were part of the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Region, which meant they were ranked in the top seven. They were so famous that everyone knew who they were.

The mysterious woman wasn’t surprised by their arrival as she calmly turned around. Jun Mengchen was the first to speak up, “What’s the famous ice beauty from the Vermillion Bird Region doing in our Azure Dragon Region? What an unexpected guest.”

Although Jun Mengchan was smiling, he was full of caution and enmity. Even Qin Lin was on high alert. After all, they were speaking with Pei Xue, a temptress who kills her captives. She was a beauty who couldn’t be subdued. Furthermore, her attainment in flame intent was extremely terrifying.

“Lady Xue, are you planning to cause trouble in our Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm?” asked Qin Lin. They were initially hiding in Flamecloud City to observe Lin Yun’s battle with the Bloodbone Realm. After all, a challenge of this scale was pretty rare in the Azure Dragon Region. Plus, the rumors about Lin Yun only needing one sword to kill had piqued their interest.

However, as they were about to recruit Lin Yun, traces of Pei Xue appeared. Lin Yun might have strong potential, but he wasn’t a threat to them for the time being. Pei Xue was a different story though. So they were on guard.

Pei Xue smiled, “Like you two, I’m interested in Lin Yun. Perhaps I might take a trip to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. You guys don’t have to think too much about it. After all, you can’t monopolize the entire Azure Dragon Region. Eventually, someone from the war realms will come to take their share.”

The war realms represented the ten strongest higher realms. They were also known as the Ten War Realms, and their foundation far exceeded the other higher realms. Unlike the other realms, the geniuses from the Ten War Realms only had one goal of heading to the Kunlun Realm.

The density of the spiritual energy and the world law in the realms they came from was the same as the Kunlun Realm. Plus, every war realm had a huge accumulation of power in the Kunlun Realm. After all, they were peerless powerhouses who had relationships with many powerful forces.

“Do you mean the war realm you came from?” Jun Mengchen asked.

Pei Xue merely smiled and replied, “You guys will know when the time comes. For now, I have a vixen to catch.”

Purple light wrapped around Pei Xue as the surrounding air started to distort. Just like that, Pei Xue disappeared.

“That woman is so vague.” Qin Lin frowned and asked, “What do you think about the geniuses from the war realms that are coming?”

“We’ll face them sooner or later at the end of the Heavenly Path. There’s no harm in facing them a little early. We’re already halfway through the Heavenly path, so we’ll face them frequently in the future.,” said Jun Mengchen.

Hearing that, Qin Lin nodded his head with a grave expression. Even as one of the seven heads of the Azure Dragon Region, he was facing great pressure from the myriad realms.

Jun Mengchen looked at the damage on the ground and said, “Looks like Lin Yun fought that woman.”

“He really isn’t simple since he was able to escape. Perhaps he might surprise us in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm,” said Qin Feng with a trace of fear in his voice. After all, Lin Yun’s sword intent was still lingering in the atmosphere.

“It’s a pity that his cultivation is still too low. Otherwise, he might be able to stand at the top of the pyramid in the Heavenly Path,” sighed Jun Mengchen.

“Let’s see if he can even survive until then. The Bloodbone Realm is nothing, but Pei Xue isn’t someone who will just accept a loss. Since she had placed her eyes on him…” Qin Lin smiled profoundly.

“He has shocking potential, and we can consider forging a friendship with him if he can survive.” Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen continued to chat. It was hard for one to walk far in the Heavenly Path by themselves, not to mention fighting against the other realms. E if one was strong, they would eventually reveal their flaw.

But if Lin Yun had enough strength, they wouldn’t mind recruiting him to face the geniuses from the other regions. This was the reason why they came to Flamecloud City from so far away.

Lin Yun traveled for four hours to ensure that the mysterious lady wasn’t following him. Only then was he able to feel relieved.

“That woman is really mysterious… She was able to dodge the second form of the Three Heavenly Divides. If it wasn’t for the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, I wouldn’t have been able to escape.” Lin Yun recalled his fight with the mysterious lady and felt a chill run down his spine. He could sense that she was at least twice as strong as Kong Xuan.

Apparently his sights had been set too low. The true stage of the Heavenly Path wouldn’t reveal itself until after he left Glorysun Land. Killing Kong Xuan meant that he was barely qualified to participate in the competition between the monstrous geniuses from myriad realms. The further he went, the tougher the fights would be. So if he wasn’t careful, he would die.

Luckily, he managed to make the mysterious lady suffer a small loss. Although she managed to avoid his attack, she was still injured in the process. This meant that she would be in trouble if they met again in the future.

However, this was nothing to Lin Yun because he was more concerned about Yue Weiwei. When they were in the Profound Amber Realm, he learned that she was searching for something in the Heavenly Path. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have lowered her cultivation willingly to descend to a lower realm. It seemed like she found what she was looking for, but was in big trouble because of it.

“Did she reveal herself because she was worried about me?” When Lin Yun thought about Yue Weiwei watching his fight, he couldn’t help sighing in a depressed manner. He wasn’t a match for the mysterious woman and he wasn’t able to help Yue Weiwei. He truly felt helpless.

At this moment, he realized that there were many experts in the Heavenly Path. However, he wasn’t about to cower because he was a swordsman.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

But the fact remained that Kong Xuan was on the Azure Dragon Ranking and not a single person from Glorysun Land had made it onto the ranking. So there was no need to be depressed.

“I have to try and make a breakthrough with my sword intent. If I can’t make a breakthrough before the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, I might not be able to find many opportunities. The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm is an opportunity for me to rise. If I miss the opportunities, I will never catch up to the monstrous geniuses,” muttered Lin Yun.

Although he could refine divine astral pellets to make progress in his cultivation swiftly, he still needed some time to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. However, his sword intent was his foundation. When he underwent his tribulation, his spiritual sword intent had already reached perfection and was only one step away from reaching the sky sword intent.

But that step was like the distance between heaven and earth. So even if his spiritual sword intent was strong, it was still at the level of spiritual sword intent.

Luckily, his fight with Kong Xuan and the mysterious lady gave him some insights for the next step. He practically forced out all of his potential into one attack against the lady. Although he couldn’t kill her, he was able to injure her. If it weren’t for Yue Weiwei injuring her, Lin Yun wouldn’t have stood a chance.

“I’ve already accumulated for a long time and it should be smooth for me to reach the sky sword intent. But the setback I suffered at the hands of the mysterious woman caused a crack in my heart as a swordsman.” Lin Yun knew about his situation, but it was also an opportunity.

He faced life and death when undergoing his first tribulation and only made a little improvement to his sword intent. So there might have been a flaw that he didn’t know about. After all, he should’ve smoothly made a breakthrough in his sword intent. It was very strange that he couldn’t make the breakthrough even though his sword intent faced the tribulation head-on.

Clearly, there was a problem that he didn’t know about. Lin Yun calmed down and started pondering his situation. As he paced back and forth, his thoughts became clear.

After a while, Lin Yun realized what the problem was. With excitement flashing on his face, Lin Yun muttered, “I see. The Three Heavenly Divides are only invincible because I never ran into an unstoppable opponent. That helped boost my confidence to be invincible.”

The Three Heavenly Divides can cut everything under the sky. But sky intent also destroyed the sky, it wasn’t limited to the things below. The Three Heavenly Divides might be strong, but Lin Yun had caged himself with his mentality.

“So I caged myself…” Lin Yun finally figured out why he couldn’t make a breakthrough in his sword intent. Heaven and earth could be shattered, but it was hard to shatter a cage.

If he hadn’t run into the mysterious woman, it could have taken him ages before he realized his flaw. I have to thank her for this.

As the excitement grew in Lin Yun’s eyes, he became confident that he could make a breakthrough in his sword intent.
