Chapter 840 - Treasury Radiance

Yue Weiwei’s words left Lin Yun feeling confused. She then smiled, “You must’ve heard that a Heavenly Path will open along with the new era, right? The so-called Heavenly Path is the starry sky you saw earlier. It’s a path filled with countless opportunities and legends. It’s a great opportunity for the geniuses in the new era.”

Lin Yun replied, “I felt that. But what did you mean by an endless battlefield?”

“It’s literally an endless battlefield with endless dangers,” said Yue Weiwei with a grave gaze. “Big Brother Yun, let’s talk about it later. The Sacred Alliance will tell you about it in the future. Look, everyone has already gone in, including Yu Haotian.”

The sudden appearance of the vortex in the Nine Dragon Lake had confirmed that the Dragoncloud Treasury had appeared. Even Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed sharply after he swallowed a few Heavenly Origin Pellets and gave Lin Yun a provoking look. He acted like he would find an opportunity to defeat Lin Yun inside the treasury.

“You seem shocked when you mentioned the Dragoncloud Treasury. Is there a story behind it?” Lin Yun asked with flickering eyes.

“Of course I’m shocked. The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master told me that after the Sword Sect was extinguished, the fortune in the Ancient Southern Domain fell to practically nothing for many years. The Dragoncloud Treasury is common in all domains except for the Ancient Southern Domain. It’s actually been a millennium since it last appeared,” explained Yue Weiwei.

“So why do you think it appeared again?” asked Lin Yun.

“Maybe it’s because of you,” smiled Yue Weiwei as she looked at Lin Yun.

“You’re more or less the reason,” said Zhao Wuji who turned around to look at Lin Yun just as he was about to enter the vortex. “The treasury doesn’t appear because no one has been worthy of its appearance. However, since the treasury has appeared, everyone will have their own opportunity. You might not get the last laugh.”

“I’m going to go in first,” said Zhao Wuji as he entered the vortex.

“Let’s go in too,” said Yue Weiwei.

“Okay,” responded Lin Yun. Then, they stepped into the vortex together. The appearance of the Dragoncloud Treasury had caused all spectators to boil with passion. All of them were looking at the vortex enviously.

The Dragoncloud Treasury was a sacred ground of inheritance. It contained all sorts of martial techniques, cosmic artifacts,secret techniques, and even divine runes.

“It’s unbelievable that the treasury appeared in the Ancient Southern Domain.” The Sacred Alliance’s judges were dumbfounded. They knew more than others, but they didn’t know that the Dragoncloud Treasury would appear.

Following the Sword Sect’s destruction, the Ancient Southern Domain’s fortunes fell. The previous overlord had been ruined. However, it was possible that the Ancient Southern Domain would rise once more because of Lin Yun’s existence.

When Lin Yun dove into the vortex, his hearing was heavily affected by a buzzing noise while he lost sight of everything. The only thing he could sense was that he was falling. By the time he regained his vision, he saw a boundless world.

The sky was dyed with multiple colors while a vast mountain range covered the horizon. Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei exchanged a glance because they could sense that the mountain range wasn’t ordinary. Without saying a word, they executed their movement techniques and left many people in their dust.

In their experience, those who were strong didn’t need to worry about being late. After all, a few hundred miles was nothing to a genius. Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei eventually appeared on the side of a mountain. From their vantage point, they saw that the mountains were incredibly tall, which made the mountain range seem endless.

“The treasures are at the top of the mountain!” At this moment, everyone could see glittering treasures at the top of each mountain. Once people made it to the top of the mountains, lightning exploded and caught several people by surprise.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei blocked the lightning like nothing. However, they found a bunch of people that made it to the top of the mountain before them. All of these people were sitting on a massive mat with an ancient purple jade stone that hovered above their heads. The bolts of lightning had come from this jade stone.

“A fragment of the Divine Radiantlight Stone!” Yue Weiwei’s eyes lit up as she explained what it was. “The Divine Radiantlight Stone is born with each era and contains the purest spiritual energy in the world. The ‘bigger world’ normally won’t have this, which should tell you how rare it is. This is a lightning-attributed Divine Radiantlight Stone, and it’ll benefit those with comprehension of lightning intent.”

While Lin Yun spoke with Yue Weiwei, Zhao Wuji opened his eyes. He was sitting with all the other geniuses and had obtained a huge harvest. The fragment also seemed to have been marked by him as it flew into his hand. When he held onto it, the other geniuses threw up blood and were sent flying. At this moment, everyone looked at Zhao Wuji unhappily.

They were all competing for the fragment of Divine Radiantlight Stone, but it was a pity that they lost to Zhao Wuji. Holding onto the fragment, Zhao Wuji was filled with endless courage as he muttered, “The Dragoncloud Treasury is truly mysterious. No wonder the geniuses from the other domains are so powerful. If I wasn’t born in the Ancient Southern Domain, my achievements would have been double what they are now.”

As he was leaving, he saw Lin Yun standing among the crowd. He couldn’t help the strange expression on his face as he smiled, “I told you. You might be the reason why the treasury opened, but you might not have the last laugh.”

His lightning intent had already touched the threshold comparable to spiritual sword intent, so he was filled with confidence at this moment. If he could make a breakthrough, he might be able to face Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent. This confidence made him want to spar with Lin Yun. However, he wasn’t Yan Long’zi, so he endured. Giving Lin Yun one last look, he departed quickly.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. It looks like Zhao Wuji wasn’t convinced of his defeat. Zhao Wuji was really confident for a loser.

When Zhao Wuji flew away, thick bolts of lightning flew around him and left many people shocked. “What power!”

“Damn it. I almost did it!” Zhao Wuji’s breakthrough in strength left many people envious, especially those who were fighting for it earlier.

“Hehe, what are you afraid of? There are opportunities everywhere here.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s right, let’s go!” Everyone’s eyes flashed with interest as they headed to the other mountains. Zhao Wuji’s harvest made many people excited because none of them expected such a huge harvest in the Dragoncloud Treasury.

“Big Brother Yun, pick that one.” Yue Weiwei was pointing at the last mountain.

“Okay, let’s go.” Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei immediately headed towards the far mountain. Many people briefly hesitated before they made the decision to follow them. However, the crowd regretted their decision because the freezing cold mountain was full of danger.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei quickly sped past everyone and reached the top of the mountain. However, Nangong Wanyu and Mu Han were already here. They were both from the Northern Snow Manor, so this wasn’t surprising.

They were staring at a painting that was hanging on the cliff. In fact, they were so captivated by the painting, that they didn’t notice the arrival of Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei. It seemed like a sword technique was recorded in the painting, but Lin Yun couldn’t see it since Nangong Wanyu and Mu Han were blocking his sight.

Just as he was about to step forward, cracks started to spread out on the painting. Then, the painting dissolved into sword rays and entered Nangong Wanyu and Mu Han’s bodies. Their sword aura surged, but the painting had been destroyed. It was impossible to look at the painting anymore.

Only now did Fang Hanluo and Nangong Wanyu turn around. With surprise, they looked at Lin Yun who was behind thiem. Suddenly, their expressions became awkward because they weren’t the ones who destroyed the painting. Based on their personalities, they wouldn’t mind comprehending it together with Lin Yun. The painting’s destruction was merely a coincidence.

“Sorry about that, Brother Lin. It was a top-tier earth grade sword technique that seemed to have lingering spiritual sword intent. However, we have no idea why the painting is gone now.” Mu Han immediately gave Lin Yun an explanation to avoid any misunderstandings.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei chatted with Mu Han and Nangong Wanyu for a little while. Soon after, Mu Han and Nangong Wanyu left for the other mountains with excitement in their eyes. At this moment, Lin Yun felt somewhat disappointed. He needed sword techniques, even if they weren’t the strongest. After all, he could benefit greatly just by comprehending them.

“I seem to have used up my luck at the banquet,” said Lin Yun with a mocking tone.

Yue Weiwei, on the other hand, smiled. She quickly made sure that Mu Han and Nangong Wanyu were truly gone before she walked towards the broken painting. Lin Yun was baffled at what she was doing, but he silently watched her. Yue Weiwei pushed out her palm and blew the fragments away, revealing a dazzling object.

“Found it!” Yue Weiwei said with excitement on her face.
