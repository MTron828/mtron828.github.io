Chapter 2379 - I’m Invincible (2)

Lin Yun said that multiple times, but this voice was the softest this time. The shock this brought to others was the greatest, making everyone’s scalps numb.

When the nine thousand ribbons flew up, they released Lin Yun’s Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent and dyed the entire sky in gold. At the same time, a golden ray flew out from Heavenly Book’s corpse, giving off a terrifying aura that contained divinity while streaking across the sky before it disappeared.

“That’s a divine seal!”

“Heavenly Book is dead!”

“There’s huge trouble this time!” All the cultivators exclaimed with fear on their faces. With Heavenly Book’s status, he had the protection of a deity from the Shadow Divine Palace, and that seal should have protected his life.

So when Heavenly Book was killed, everyone didn’t think that he was actually dead and would only be heavily injured at most. After all, he had the protection of a deity. Even Tuoba Hong wasn’t dead when he only had a skeletal frame.

But everyone’s faces changed when they saw that seal because that represented the death of Heavenly Book. They could only say that Lin Yun was fast and ruthless, extinguishing Heavenly Book’s saint origin before he could respond.

“How did this happen...? Lin Yun... how dare you...!” Jiang Ziyao’s hands trembled, looking at Lin Yun with disbelief. He continued, “You’re in deep trouble now!”

Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli were also dumbfounded. They were divine disciples of the Shadow Divine Palace, and they never thought that Lin Yun would kill Heavenly Book. After all, Heavenly Book was the Shadow Divine Palace’s chief disciple, and the Shadow Divine Palace used a lot of resources to nurture him.

“Flower Burial, you’re insane!” Shangguan Jue looked at Lin Yun with a pale face.

Lin Yun hovered in the air, sneering with mockery, “Didn’t you guys say that the rules were fair? What the matter? Do you guys find it unfair now? Didn’t you guys say to kill me before competing for the lotuses earlier?”

Jiang Ziyao’s words were stuck, making him unable to say another word as his face became red. Lin Yun’s words were like a resounding slap to his face, not to mention that he was the one who said that.

While everyone was shocked, Qin Yun suddenly screamed and his saint origin exploded. Then, a divine seal streaked across the horizon. This left everyone stumped, and even Jiang Ziyao no longer dared to say another word. Everyone was shocked as they looked at Qin Yun with doubt. No one expected that Qin Yun would die next.

Although he had a hole in his chest, it wasn’t fatal to a Saint. A Saint wouldn’t die even with their heads decapitated, possessing unimaginable life force. So, the hole in his chest could only be considered a heavy injury at most. That's why no one expected Qin Yun to die.

Everyone in the surroundings didn't know how Qin Yun died, but Profound Sky Venerable knew. It was the sword intent that Lin Yun had left within Qin Yun’s body. The sword intent contained Yin and Yang flames that slowly tortured Qin Yun to death. Even the divine seal couldn’t withstand that and could only watch as Qin Yun’s vitality slowly disappeared.

Profound Sky Venerable felt that Lin Yun had faced a divine seal before and devised a method to deal with it. He turned to Ji Zixi and sighed, “Has he always been like that? Regardless of the Shadow Divine Palace or Dao Sect, they are powerful forces with Ancestral Stage experts there, and no one dares to touch their chief disciples.”

Ji Zixi looked at Profound Sky Venerable, and said, “Venerable, what has that got to do with Lin Yun’s style?”

“Is it not related? You only say that because he’s your beloved,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

Ji Zixi seriously said, “This has nothing to do with it. I know they wouldn’t have let Big Brother Lin go even if he spared them. They were the ones who plotted against Big Brother Lin on the ancient battlefield, and Big Brother Lin would have been dead if he hadn’t been strong enough. Big Brother Lin could have retaliated, and yet he held back. But what happened after that? They still came after him, wanting to kill him first before competing for the lotus quotas. So, who could they blame for their deaths?”

Profound Sky Venerable was surprised that Ji Zixi would say that.

“Since that’s the case, why should Big Brother Lin go easy on them? This has nothing to do with Big Brother Lin’s style. He’s a swordsman, and he will only fight for the breath in his chest,” Ji Zixi continued.

“I’m surprised you understand that at such a young age. It’s so simple, but they don’t seem to understand it,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

Ji Zixi looked at Qin Yun’s corpse, and said, “That’s because they’re used to standing on the top of the pyramid, and they won’t take another look at someone who isn’t on the same level as them. They bullied you, so you can only bear it. You’re at fault if you dare to retaliate, and you should be grateful for them if they stopped.”

“That’s right. They’re used to standing on the top of the pyramid,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

Right then, Tuoba Hong got back on his feet and dashed off the stage while everyone’s attention was on Qin Yun, using his Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf beast form as he fled.

But Lin Yun was even faster and pushed his palm forth. The ribbons behind him released a powerful sword vibration and Tuoba Hong wailed while he rolled on the ground, shrinking in size with his life force being sapped from him. When he stabilized himself, he was no different from a dog now.

Just when Lin Yun wanted to make a move, he noticed that Tuoba Hong had already left the stage, so he could only stop.

Tuoba Hong roared at Lin Yun, but he didn’t look like a primordial beast now. This left everyone in the surroundings dumbfounded. When they came to their senses, they laughed, “He became a dog...”

“Flower Burial was right!”

“This is too pitiful. A Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf was beaten to a dog.”

“Hahaha! Tuoba Hong’s reputation is finished!”

Tuoba Hong was furious and wanted to curse, but the only sound that came out from him was barking. This made his face even redder while everyone’s laughter got louder. The humiliation made him leave without turning back.

“I give...” Jiang Ziyao wanted to give up immediately after coming to his senses, but he couldn’t finish his sentence because Lin Yun was looking at him. When he opened his mouth, the ribbons with the Azure Dragon Divine Rune and Divine Phoenix Rune engraved on them flew at him. The six thousand ribbons were like shackles binding him.

“Anyone can give up but you!” Lin Yun said, looking at Jiang Ziyao. When he said that, the other disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion and Shadow Divine Palace stepped back with their faces changing.

“Lin Yun, spare me... I won’t give up. You can just cripple my cultivation, and I promise that I won’t come after you again. I will do anything as long as you spare my life!” Jiang Ziyao struggled as he begged.

But Lin Yun was calm as he controlled more ribbons to wrap around Jiang Ziyao. It didn’t take long before those ribbons burrowed into Jiang Ziyao’s body and slowly crushed his bones. This was Lin Yun’s solution for the divine seal: to either kill before the divine seal could react or slowly torture someone so that the divine seal couldn’t activate. Ultimately, it was just a seal left behind by a deity.

This process didn’t last for long before Jiang Ziyao’s body blew apart and the divine seal left the Heavenly Barren Realm. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Take the lotuses!” Lin Yun looked at Lin Jiangxian, Ao Jue, and Xiong Tiannan. The three still hadn’t come to their senses because it should have been a tough competition for nine spots, but Lin Yun easily dealt with the holy lands’ geniuses.

Out of six geniuses, one was reduced to a dog, two had their arms crippled, and three died. This outcome was something that not even Profound Sky Venerable had expected, not to mention everyone else.

“Holy shit, five quotas out of ten have gone to Lin Yun’s group.”

“Once the Heavenly Barren Banquet opens, it will surely shock everyone.”

“I’m afraid Flower Burial’s name will spread throughout the three thousand realms, and no one can look down on him anymore!”

“He must become the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s disciple, or he will die. The Dao Sect, Shadow Divine Palace, and Heavenly Sword Pavilion aren’t pushovers!” Looking at Lin Yun’s group as they occupied four lotuses, everyone was filled with shock and wondered if they were dreaming.

But the disciples of the six immortal holy lands looked at Lin Yun with fury. They weren’t convinced, but they didn’t dare to say a single word.
