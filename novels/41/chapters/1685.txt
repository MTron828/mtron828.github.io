Chapter 1686 – Who’s Your Master?

While Lin Wan, Luo Shuyi, and Yue Weiwei were chatting, Lin Yun smoothly met up with An Liuyan in the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Since An Liuyan had left ahead of him, she had arrived in the Heavenly Domain City ten days ago.

When An Liuyan heard Lin Yun’s story and saw the token that Lin Wan gave him, she smiled, “This has saved us a lot of trouble. The Four Musical Houses’ gates are nearly impenetrable. Despite the strict selection, many people still visit them.”

“So you’re saying I should go to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion?” Lin Yun asked.

Nodding her head, An Liuyan smiled, “Young Master might not know, but the Nirvana Banquet has limited quotas. Aside from the six holy lands, others can only participate through the Four Musical Houses.”

“No other alternatives?” Lin Yun continued to ask.

“None.” An Liuyan smiled. “Then again, if you come from a musical clan possessing an ancient inheritance, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion will take the initiative to invite you.”

The Kunlun Realm has ten musical clans, and each clan has an inheritance. They also have Grandmaster Musicians in their clans. The Grandmaster Musicians were musicians who grasped the Divine Dragon Tone, and a top-tiered Grandmaster Musician could confront a top-tiered expert of the Emperor Realm. But someone like that was even rarer than Emperor Realm experts.

As for the Celestial Tone, they’re practically myths, so no one could play it in the current Divine Dragon Era. Only those who grasped the Noble Tone could be called a musician, those who grasped the Saint Tone could be called Grand Musicians, and those who grasped the Imperial Tone could be called Master Musicians.

Compared to cultivators, a Musician was equivalent to the Dragon Pulse Realm; a Grand Musician equivalent was to the Samsara Edict Realm; a Master Musician was equivalent to the Saint Realm; and Grandmaster Musicians equivalent were to the Emperor Realm. Then again, that was a rough equivalent, and it was more complicated in reality.

Like cultivators in the same realm, their strengths would defer due to their martial intents and cultivation techniques. That was the same for music dao.

Now that Lin Yun grasped the Saint Tone, he was equivalent to a Grand Musician, but his cultivation in soul energy was lacking. So he naturally couldn’t face a Samsara Edict Realm expert. But generally speaking, he was exceptional, and cases like his were rare. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered about that now. He briefly pondered before he said, “If you feel that there’s nothing wrong with that, I’ll make a trip to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion in three days.”

“Yeah.” An Liuyan nodded. “And if you’re interested in music dao, you can take this opportunity to cultivate in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Since the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion is one of the Four Musical Houses, they naturally have a deep foundation and accumulation.

“Oh, right. I managed to collect thirty-five petals of Heavenly Snow Lotus. They’re too precious, so it should normally be impossible for me to collect them within a short time. I wonder if it’s enough for you.” An Liuyan took out a box and pushed it over to Lin Yun.

Opening the box and taking a look, Lin Yun said, “It should be enough for me to repair my second dragon pulse.”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable?” An Liuyan was shocked. Just how serious were Lin Yun’s injuries? Even a saint only needed a few petals if they were injured.

“The effects are declining.” Lin Yun simply explained the situation to An Liuyan. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Then we’ll have to try and see if we can get the seeds. It’s impossible to find a complete Heavenly Snow Lotus, but there might be a chance if we find the seeds. I’ll help you pay attention this time.” An Liuyan said with a grave expression.

She finally knew how serious Lin Yun’s injuries were. Logically speaking, Lin Yun should be able to make a breakthrough to the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm with his harvest in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and it shouldn’t be an issue for him to reach the sixth or even the seventh-pulse in six months.

After all, An Liuyan was already at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But Lin Yun’s dragon pulses were damaged, and he would only be able to recover to the fourth-pulse at best in six months.

Seeing her concern, Lin Yun smiled, “Everything is hard to predict in this world. You don’t have to be in such a hurry because this isn’t exactly bad for me. My cultivation increased too quickly over the past two years, so I can use this time to condense everything.”

“It’s good that Young Master Lin can think of it this way. But I’ll have to find the seeds. The Snow Lotus Heart of the Heavenly Snow Lotus should be able to help you recover.” An Liuyan replied.

“Alright. I’ll stay here for the next three days, then.” Lin Yun said.

“Okay.” An Liuyan smiled.

It was just as Lin Yun had expected. Thirty-five petals of Heavenly Snow Lotus could only barely restore his second dragon pulse. The effects of the heavenly Snow Lotus had gradually declined, so if he calculated this way, he would need a hundred petals to restore his third dragon pulse. As for his fourth dragon pulse, there was no point in him thinking about it.

Three days later, Lin Yun quietly left the Heavenly Star Pavilion. He looked around for the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s direction along the way. When he saw the majestic thirty-six mountains, he was deeply shocked. He now knew why the Heavenly Domain City was known as a saint city; just one of the Four Musical Houses alone was shocking enough. This only meant that the three remaining musical houses wouldn’t be inferior.

When Lin Yun took out the token, he smoothly entered the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and it didn’t take long for him to see Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan again.

“Is there an outcome?” Lin Yun asked after greeting them.

Nodding her head, Lin Wan replied, “There shouldn’t be a problem. You can go to the Saint Altar with us and meet Elder Mu.”

While the three were chatting, they headed towards the Saint Altar. Along the way, they met many people heading towards the Saint Altar. The Saint Altar was located at the central mountain that was amongst the thirty-six spiritual mountains. This was an important ground of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion so, usually, no one was allowed to get close to it.

But many people had gathered here today, and all the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were practically gathered here. When Lin Yun was brought in, he could sense the solemn atmosphere in the surroundings. There were ten-odd Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s elders seated on a mat on the stage.

They were all Samsara Edict Realm experts, and some even reached the pinnacle Nirvana Stage. This alarmed Lin Yun because they weren’t only proficient in music dao, but their martial cultivation wasn’t weak.

As for the woman seated at the center, she emitted a terrifying aura that even made Lin Yun fearful. Lin Yun confirmed that she was a Quasi-Saint, and had grasped some of the saint dao. If she condensed her saint origin, she could take a step further and become a Saint Realm expert.

This formation shocked him because this formation was a little too massive. According to Lin Wan, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion wouldn’t immediately give him the quota, but he would be exempted from the initial tests.

“Junior Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan pay our greetings to the elders.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi bowed.

“You’re the person recommended by Her Highness Profound Fairy?”

“It’s actually a man! But isn’t his cultivation a little too low? He’s only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Our cultivation might not be important as a musician, but his cultivation is a little too low.”

“Can it be that this person doesn’t have any inheritance? If he’s from a clan, he should have a higher cultivation.”

“This is a little disappointing. With Her Highness Profound Fairy’s identity, shouldn’t someone she recommended be strong?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were disappointed as they looked at Lin Yun, and it didn’t take long for the Saint Altar to break into an uproar.

Lin Yun was inwardly shocked when he heard the surrounding discussions because this meant that Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi’s sister seemed to have such a high position that the majority of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were here.

Even the ten-odd elders had doubts in their pupils. They exchanged a glance before they shook their heads. They weren’t too satisfied with Lin Yun.

Right then, Elder Mu’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, and the surroundings fell into silence, and the other elders also stopped discussing amongst themselves.

“You’re Lin Xiao?” Elder Mu’s gaze was calm, and no one could gauge her age from her appearance. She looked like a lady in her twenties, enveloped in strong pressure.

“This is Elder Mu, Mu Xueling, the Saint Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Lin Wan quickly explained the lady’s identity to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun already had a speculation. Cupping his hands together, he said, “That’s me.”

But his tone held no respect, causing everyone who heard him furrow their brows. After all, this was equivalent to being disrespectful to the Saint Elder. Even the other elders furrowed their brows, and some had fury on their faces. After all, Elder Mu was the Saint Elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!

But Mu Xueling stopped them, and she asked, “Who’s your master? And where do you come from?”

“A nameless person from a nameless sect.” Lin Yun replied. He didn’t have a sect inheritance for his music dao because it was all taught to him by Lil’ Purple. Could it be that he was going to call a lass his master? Lil’ Purple probably wouldn’t agree to it, either.
