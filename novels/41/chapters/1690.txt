Chapter 1691 – A Golden Age’s Arrival

“Don’t even think about it.” Luo Shuyi rolled her eyes.

“Let’s not talk about that now and bring you to your residence. You don’t want to be observed by everyone like an animal, right?” Lin Wan smiled.

The eyes of everyone in the surroundings were on Lin Yun, and their gazes were filled with curiosity. They were all curious about Lin Yun, who gave Elder Jiang Yu a beating on his first day there and even teased Saint Elder. Just one of them could have Lin Yun killed, but he was fine standing there.

“Lin Xiao!” When Lin Yun was about to leave, Jiang Yu walked over with several elders.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic as he smiled, “Elder Jiang is truly worthy of being a pinnacle of Samsara Edict Realm expert to recover your injuries so quickly.”

“Saint Elder might have let you off, but that doesn’t mean I will let you off as well. You better behave yourself in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and don’t give me a chance!” Jiang Yu said, suppressing his rage. When he was done, he waved his hand and left.

Looking at Jiang Yu’s silhouette, Lin Yun wondered if he went a little easy on the former because the former didn’t look like he had learned his lesson.

It didn’t take long for Lin Wan to bring Lin Yun to a residence. Lin Yun would be staying here before the Nirvana Banquet. This place was called the Ripplewave Pavilion, and there were no outsiders, making it much more convenient for them to chat.

Lin Wan wasn’t polite as she said, “You better behave yourself. You nearly scared us earlier. Saint Elder is an envoy from the Divine Mountain, and no one can save you if you offend her!”

“The Divine Mountain? Where’s that?” Lin Yun asked.

“No one knows where the Divine Mountain is located. It’s only a form of address. No one knows if the Divine Mountain existed, but it can also be called the Heavenly Fragrance Sacred Ground. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion is a musical house that was established in the Heavenly Fragrance Sacred Ground within the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. The actual Heavenly Fragrance Sacred Ground is extremely ancient, an existence that far exceeds anyone’s imagination. It’s a secret that not even the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples know much about.”

Lin Yun was shocked that Mu Xueling had such a huge origin, a Saint Elder and an envoy. Not to mention that the last gaze that she gave him was profound.

“We shouldn’t reveal it to you, but you saved our lives. No matter what, we don’t wish to see anything happen to you in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Luo Shuyi followed up.

Looking at the concern on Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan’s faces, Lin Yun felt a little guilty because he realized his earlier actions made them worry for him. He immediately apologized, “I know I was a little reckless earlier, but please believe that I didn’t mean it. I didn’t have a choice.”

“It’s fine. If you suffered a grievance, there’s no need for you to keep bearing it. Just keep it in mind not to provoke Saint Elder.” Luo Shuyi said.

“I understand.” Lin Yun bitterly smiled. He also didn’t want to provoke Mu Xueling, but if the latter really listened to Jiang Yu and examined if he had a divine dragon bone, his identity would be exposed. Thus, he didn’t have a choice in doing what he did earlier.

“Young Master Lin can rest early.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi bade farewell after telling Lin Yun some rules about the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

Simultaneously, at the summit of the snowy mountain where Yue Weiwei was dancing, Mu Xueling appeared in the region where Yue Weiwei’s aunt was at. This was an abode. Despite the snowfall outside, the insides of the cave were warm.

Yue Weiwei’s aunt was in the cave, elegantly brewing tea by the lakeside. Aside from being Yue Weiwei’s ‘Aunt,’ she still had another identity. She was the pavilion master of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“For you to come here, is that person really Lin Yun?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked.

Shaking her head, Mu Xueling replied, “He’s Lin Xiao. No disguise can fool the Heavenly Origin Mirror. But the Heavenly Origin Mirror saw something on him, and I didn’t show it, fearing it might cause an uproar.”

“What did you see?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked.

“A Sovereign Constellation.” Mu Xueling replied.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master, who was brewing tea, was briefly stunned when she heard that. She then asked with a grave expression, “Are you certain you didn’t make a mistake?”

“I’m certain.” Mu Xueling said.

“Then this Lin Xiao probably has a huge origin. He can either be a holy son or the dao child of an ancient force. First, there’s Flower Burial, and now, a successor of a Sovereign Constellation has appeared. The various holy lands and the Divine Dragon Empire also have geniuses emerging. Various monstrous geniuses are appearing, and I’m afraid the peace in the Divine Dragon Era for the past three thousand years will soon disappear.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master said, standing up.

As Mu Xueling’s eyes shone brightly, she said, “Everything has a balance in the world. When something flourishes to a certain limit, it will decline and vice-versa. Three thousand years ago, the Nine Emperors appeared, and the fortune of the entire era was on the nine of them. Now that three thousand years have passed, it’s time for the Blue Dragon Record to be rewritten.”

“Is the Blue Dragon Record going to reappear?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked.

“Most likely.” Mu Xueling replied.

“The Blue Dragon Record…” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master sighed. “How grand will it be when the Blue Dragon Record that transcends the three rankings appears again? It looks like a Golden Age will arrive in the Kunlun Realm.”

The Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings were established by the Divine Dragon Empire, sorting out the information of cultivators from the different regions and splitting the Kunlun Realm into five.

They were the Eastern Desolation, Western Desert, Southern Border, Northern Ridge, and the Divine Dragon Empire. Regardless of the Eastern Desolation, Western Desert, or the other regions, they’re unbelievably massive. It was hard for Saints to try and travel through the five regions by relying on their own strength.

After all, there were many forbidden grounds that contained unimaginable terror. Each region had its Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings. But the Blue Dragon Record transcended the three rankings, and its appearance would change the tendency of the Kunlun Realm.

The Blue Dragon Record was a divine artifact. The moment someone’s name made it into the Blue Dragon Record, they would be protected by the entire Divine Dragon Empire, becoming the holy son of the Divine Dragon Era.

This divine artifact was in the hands of the Divine Dragon Empire, in the hand of The Empress. But there were rumors that the Empress could not grasp the divine artifact. After all, every divine artifact had a spirit of its own, and it would only appear when the time was right.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master fell into deep thoughts, and she continued, “So you feel that Lin Xiao isn’t here for the Nirvana Banquet, but came out to train himself after knowing that the Blue Dragon Record will reappear?”

“There’s a possibility in both.” Mu Xueling replied.

“Oh, right. Which lineage does his Sovereign Saint Artifact belong to?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked.

“This is the reason for my doubt. His Sovereign Constellation is blue, and I can’t see through it even with the Heavenly Origin Mirror.” Mu Xueling said with her brows furrowed as she placed the cup of tea on the table.

“How is that possible?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master was shocked.

Gently blowing at the cup of tea, Mu Xueling took a small sip before she replied, “That’s the truth. I can only see bits and pieces of his secret, but they corresponded with none of the existing hundred Sovereign Constellations.”

“Can it be that you made a mistake?” asked the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master.

“No.” Mu Xueling said in a confident tone. “Sovereign Constellations cannot be faked. He can pretend to be Lin Yun but can’t fake a Sovereign Constellation.”

“He’s mysterious.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master said.

“He’s also an asshole.” Mu Xueling placed the cup and told the pavilion master what happened on the Saint Altar.

Hearing what Mu Xueling said, the pavilion master couldn’t help laughing, “He’s really bold to even dare to tease the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Envoy. I have to make sure Weiwei keeps a distance from him.”

After Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi left, Lin Yun didn’t waste time and began to practice the Divine Tortoise Transformation. Under the pressure of the Heavenly Origin Mirror, the Divine Tortoise Transformation became complete, which was a pleasant surprise.

When he circulated the Divine Tortoise Transformation, ancient runes appeared on the ground where he was seated. As the runes intertwined, they formed a profound seal, the Black Tortoise Seal. When the seal was formed, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a breath with light shining in his pupils.

“Looks like there’s a benefit in taking a risk…” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t expect to make a breakthrough in the Divine Tortoise Transformation under the pressure of the Heavenly Origin Mirror.

Now that he managed to condense the Black Tortoise Seal, there would be no flaw in his disguise even if he was standing before a Saint. Most importantly, he had given it a try earlier and discovered that the Black Tortoise Seal could conceal the aura of the Blue Dragon Bone. If someone touched him right now, they wouldn’t be able to find the divine dragon bone, which had resolved a hidden threat for him.

Since the Heavenly Origin Mirror could see through disguises, it might be able to reverse something to its primal form. But Mu Xueling probably didn’t know about that, judging from her response. When he raised his head, dazzling sunlight shone into the room, and it was already day without him knowing it.

“It doesn’t sound bad to stay in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion for a time.” Lin Yun muttered as he laid on the bed. He then took out the Heavenly Fragrance Medal and toyed with it. His scope was limited when he stayed in the Sword Sect.

The Eastern Desolation was massive and didn’t just have the Ancient Barren Domain. It was also more exciting than he had imagined.

Suddenly, the medal in his hand trembled, and his face became uncertain. Right then, Mu Xueling’s voice came from the medal, “Everyone with this medal is to gather at the Saint Altar in an incense time. No one is allowed to be missing.”

This made Lin Yun curious as he wondered if Mu Xueling wanted to hold the final test ahead of time. But he didn’t dare to neglect it because he knew it was best for him not to provoke this woman.
