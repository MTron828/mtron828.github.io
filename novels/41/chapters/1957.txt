Chapter 1958 - Conflict

The interior of the Solar Jade Palace was enveloped in a saint radiance with multiple stone pillars that were erected. They looked like towering swords if looked at from afar, making one feel insignificant before them and wearing grave expressions.

With Yuan Chen leading the way, Lin Yun soon arrived at the destination. The far end of the Solar Jade Palace was a spacious field with multiple stone pillars that were erected. At the depths, there was an abyssal cliff with an azure stone platform hovering in the air.

Beneath the stone platform was water, while the back of the platform was an ancient painting. When the two arrived, many swordsmen were gathered here, and the numbers were more than Lin Yun had expected. He exclaimed in surprise, “So many people?”

The Heavenly Dao Sect wasn’t mainly focused on the sword, but there were so many swordsmen here, and most were in the late phase of the Nirvana Stage. When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, he saw that they were all at least at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Many geniuses were at the fifth, sixth, or seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Even Yuan Chen was at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. There was a huge difference between them regarding their cultivations, but they shared a similarity of having grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

With a rough estimation, there were nearly two hundred of them. Was this the foundation of Eastern Desolation’s strongest holy land?

Lin Yun was inwardly shocked, but he wasn’t too surprised that they all grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, since they were at the Nirvana Stage.

“Aside from the four strongest swordsmen, every saint disciple who qualifies is here,” Yuan Chen explained.

“Four strongest swordsmen?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“You were not a saint disciple in the past, so you naturally don’t know about them. The four strongest swordsmen are legendary figures who have grasped the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent with their cultivation teaching the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage,” Yuan Chen explained. “They all want to grasp the Astral Sword Intent and become the strongest swordsman in the Heavenly Dao Sect. So they’re usually outside of the sect, training.”

“The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden isn’t among them?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden was too young then. Those four were already known as the four strongest swordsman before she entered the Nirvana Stage,” Yuan Chen smiled. The two chatted as they casually looked for a place to sit down. The field was massive, so they came to an empty ground.

Many people noticed Ye Qingtian and lowered their voices. After all, Ye Qingtian quickly rose in the ranks, obtaining first in the Di Group, and even had an ambitious relationship with two holy maidens. This naturally made all the saint disciples unhappy because the two holy maidens had many pursuers.

Not to mention that Ye Qingtian was just expelled from the Ye Clan, which offended the Zhang Clan. So even if Ye Qingtian was the champion of Di Group, everyone here participated in the Tian Group, and none accepted Ye Qingtian in their hearts.

“Ye Qingtian, you really dare to come to the Nether Orchid Courtyard!” A voice resounded. This naturally attracted Lin Yun’s attention, who was preparing to sit down while chatting with Yuan Chen. The voice came from an azure-robed swordsman from the Dao Yang Palace’s direction, and that swordsman was coldly looking at him.

The surroundings fell into silence when they looked at the person who spoke. This person was a saint’s disciple of the Dao Yang Palace, Ye Xin of the Ye Clan, with a cultivation at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

No one was fond of Ye Qingtian here, and the Ye Clan was naturally the most furious. After all, Ye Qingtian’s act of slapping the Azure Solar Saint Lord spread throughout the Heavenly Dao Sect. This naturally made the juniors in the Ye Clan feel humiliated.

“That’s weird. Why can’t I come here?” Lin Yun smiled fearlessly.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re disrespectful to your seniors! Do you really think no one can deal with you in the Ye Clan?” Ye Xin coldly looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s eyes coldly flashed, and what Ye Guhan said wasn’t wrong. The Ye Clan was really troublesome. Let’s not mention that he wasn’t Ye Qingtian, even if he was Ye Qingtian, he did nothing wrong to the Ye Clan.

“Senior Brother, calm down. This is the Solar Jade Palace, the residence of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint,” Yuan Chen said.

“Who do you think you are? A piece of trash from the Lower Nine Peaks. Who gave you the right to speak?” Ye Xin said, looking at Yuan Chen.

“The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint invited someone from the Lower Nine Peaks…?”

“Is there a need to invite them? How much potential can they have? They’re a waste of resources, even if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint teaches them.”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Only the Lower Nine Peaks are willing to befriend someone like Ye Qingtian.” Not only Ye Xin, but everyone else began to insult Yuan Chen as well with disdain filling their tones.

Lin Yun now understood why Yuan Chen was so friendly to him. Yuan Chen already knew what kind of person these people were.

Yuan Chen’s gaze became awkward with a hint of fury, but he ultimately bore it down.

“Get lost. I’m teaching Ye Qingtian a lesson as a clansman of the Ye Clan. Who the hell are you?!” Ye Xin flashed and appeared before Yuan Chen with his palm descending down.

This palm was ferocious. He had fully unleashed his cultivation at the sixth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and this naturally caught Yuan Chen by surprise. But when his palm was about to descend on Yuan Chen, a person appeared before Ye Xin, and this person was Ye Qingtian.

Fury blazed within Ye Xin’s pupils and he circulated his ghost spirit cultivation technique, using 50% of his nirvana aura.

But Lin Yun calmly took this attack head-on and smiled, “It looks like there’s really no one left in the Ye Clan. You’re not any stronger than Ye Feifan yourself.”

Seeing this scene, everyone looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief because Ye Qingtian was using the nirvana aura. If they remembered correctly, Ye Qingtian was only at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage back during the Ranking Battle. But Ye Qingtian reached the Nirvana Stage so quickly? Most importantly, Ye Qingtian was holding his stance against Ye Xin. One must know that they didn’t use their sword intent and purely relied on their cultivation.

The few strongest here raised their heads to look at Ye Qingtian when they sensed his cultivation.

Seeing that the stalemate was ongoing, Ye Xin took several steps back and sneered, “Since you’ve made your move, that saves me the effort to find another reason. Today, I have to slap you two, no matter what!”

Ye Xin was cocky and his tone was filled with confidence. He felt that since Ye Qingtian made a move, this gave him an excuse to make a move against Ye Qingtian as well.

“Ye Xin, Ye Qingtian was personally invited over by the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, and your Ye Clan’s affairs are nothing compared to her!” Wang Yue of the Nether Orchid Courtyard barked.

“Ha. He’s just a shameless piece of garbage. Do you really think that the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden will look at him differently?” Ye Xin sneered with the nirvana aura within his body exploding.

“Stop!” A cold bark echoed, accompanied by a terrifying aura that spread out. This instantly made everyone here feel a pressure crushing down on them. When they turned their heads around, they saw the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.

“Nether Orchid Holy Maiden!” Everyone’s eyes lit up when they saw Bai Shuying, and even Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a peek at the former.

A good opportunity! Ye Xin’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene.

But just when he was going to make a move, Lin Yun already sensed it with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart and his palm fell on Ye Xin’s chest first. With a huge collision, Ye Xin slammed against a stone pillar with blood dripping down the corner of his lips.

This scene instantly left everyone stumped because none of them expected that Ye Qingtian’s palm would be so terrifying.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you launch a sneak attack on me!” Ye Xin struggled back up on his feet. Everyone else also wore disdain on their faces as they looked at Ye Qingtian.

“He’s still the same shameless person as before.”

“He was already so cocky after reaching the Nirvana Stage. So what if he has a strong talent for the sword?”

“He is just a lecher from the Indigo Thunder Peak. The holy maiden came to help him, but he took this opportunity and attacked Ye Xin instead.”

Sounds of mockery came from the surroundings and Yuan Chen was stumped. He clearly saw that Ye Xin wanted to make a move, but Ye Qingtian was faster than him.

Bai Shuying furrowed her brow because she didn’t notice that Ye Xin wanted to make a move against Ye Qingtian earlier. But her rationale told her that Ye Qingtian wasn’t such a person. When she interacted with him seven days ago, Ye Qingtian didn’t make things difficult on her and made her change her impression about him.

“Ye Qingtian, I believe you. Why don’t you explain your actions?” Bai Shuying said.

But Lin Yun casually sat down and smiled, “Why do I have to explain myself? Those who believe me, will believe me; and those who don't, won’t believe me no matter what I say. Furthermore, I don’t care about that at all.”

“You don’t care, even if so many people are calling you shameless?” Bai Shuying asked with her brows furrowed and faint resentment within her pupils.

Lin Yun raised his head and was confused as to why Bai Shuying was furious. He replied, “It doesn’t matter to you.”

“Holy Maiden, why waste your saliva with him? Let me teach him a lesson and let him know the consequences of launching a sneak attack!” Ye Xin incited. He stood up and wore a smirk, wanting to make a move against Ye Qingtian. He felt that the reason why he was injured was purely because Ye Qingtian caught him by surprise.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with disdain, and he looked at Ye Xin with a playful gaze.

“Ye Xin, watch your manners against the holy maiden. Come back.” A youth spoke out from the Dao Yang Palace’s group. He had a powerful cultivation, and his tone was filled with unquestionable prestige. He was one of the strongest amongst the younger generation of the Ye Clan, Ye Qinghong.

“Since Big Brother Qinghong spoke out, I’ll let you off for now.” Ye Xin had no choice but to give up, even if he was unwilling, and his tone was respectful when he mentioned Ye Qinghong.
