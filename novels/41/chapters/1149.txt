Chapter 1150 - There’s No One From My Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect

While Ye Ziling and Qin Feng were locked in a stalemate, more demonic cultivators gathered because of the phenomena. There were even some who emanated a terrifying aura.

The situation was already tense because of Qin Feng’s party, so things were getting complicated for Ye Ziling. Qin Feng squinted his eyes together before licking his lips and snickering, “Ye Ziling, why are you dragging this out? Hand over the origin stone quickly!”

Ye Ziling’s face changed slightly and turned cold, “The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s elders will be here in just half a day. At that time, none of you will be able to escape!”

Her words instantly caused an uproar among the demonic cultivators. After all, they only came because of Lei Ying’s prestige. However, no one wanted to give up their life and face the elders of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Even Qin Feng’s face changed briefly before he grinned, “The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is ranked at the bottom of the four sects, and it’s no longer the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect it used to be. Don’t tell me that as demonic cultivators, you guys are scared out of your wits after listening to what she said?”

The robust man on the left of Qin Feng grinned, “Even if it’s just half a day, can you guys even last that long?”

“It’s troublesome that the three of them are here. The other demonic cultivators most likely won’t leave,” said Liu Yuan with his brows locked together.

“What’s the origin of those three?” Lin Yun asked.

“The one on Qin Feng’s right is called Xiao Kun. Although he’s not ranked in the top ten in the Profound Wither Sea, he’s not that far away in terms of strength. The one on the left is named Luo Kui. His cultivation is at the greater Astral Stage, and he’s known for his brutality and courage as he has barged into the campsite of the four sects,” said Liu Yuan.

Lin Yun nodded his head lightly. Qin Feng was ranked tenth, and he had two Astral Stage demonic cultivators beside him. Clearly, the disparity in strength was the confidence in Qin Feng’s decision.

“What if I can hold Luo Kui back?” Lin Yun suddenly said as he looked at the man standing at the left of Qin Feng.

“What the hell are you talking about?” Liu Yuan looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. If Lin Yun could block Luo Kui, they would be able to charge their way out of the encirclement. However, Liu Yuan wasn’t optimistic about it.

Lin Yun didn’t lower his voice when he spoke, which caused countless gazes to lock onto him. Ye Ziling was surprised to hear Lin Yun’s question. Although she had to admit that Lin Yun was talented, Luo Kui was still someone in the Astral Stage. The latter could easily suppress Lin Yun by relying on his cultivation alone.

“Hahaha!” The demonic cultivators were briefly stunned before they began to laugh.

“Looks like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has really declined to actually let a brat in the Heavenly Soul Realm participate. Don’t you guys have anyone else? I’m too embarrassed to kill you!” Luo Kui laughed.

“You feel embarrassed to kill someone? I’m afraid you don't have the capability to kill me. Anyway, why are you guys stalling? What are you afraid of? You don’t even dare to attack without Lei Ying here. In the end, you’re just a bunch of cowards!”

Lin Yun had his own speculation and guessed that Lei Ying must have encountered trouble seeing that they had yet to make their moves. So if he could hold back Luo Kui, there was a high chance that the group could slaughter their way out of the encirclement. At that time, they would have plenty of time to leave the island with the origin stone before Lei Ying returns.

“Is that brat insane?!”

“I’ve seen arrogant people, but this is the first time I’ve seen someone who isn’t afraid of death! A mere ant in the Heavenly Soul Realm dares to provoke Luo Kui? Doesn’t he know what the Astral Stage means?”

“He’s simply courting death!” Lin Yun’s words caused an uproar among the crowd as all the demonic cultivators looked at Lin Yun with indifference and ridicule.

“You want to die? Then I’ll fulfill your wish!” Luo Kui’s eyes flashed with cold light as he smiled sinisterly at Lin Yu. Then, a crimson aura leaked out of his body as he prepared to attack.

“Watch out!” Ye Ziling’s face changed as Luo Kui disappeared.

When he reappeared, he was in front of Lin Yun swinging his sword. With his blade shining brightly, many people had a hard time watching.

But when the light dissipated, everyone was shocked to discover that Lin Yun had already shifted from his initial location. The only thing that Luo Kui managed to hit was the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

“You’re pretty fast at running!” Luo Kui’s eyes flashed coldly as crimson light began to appear on his palm. Then, he swung his blade once more.

Lin Yun managed to dodge the attack that was only a few inches away from his cheek. However, Luo Kui didn’t stop attacking. He kept swinging his blade to suppress Lin Yun. “Die!”

At the same time, he had fully unleashed his aura in the Astral Stage. If he was facing an ordinary expert in the Heavenly Soul Realm, he would’ve easily rendered his opponent immobilized.

Lin Yun’s face turned cold as he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Purple-golden dragon runes began to gather towards his hands to create armor over his arm.

Just like that, Lin Yun took Luo Kui’s attack head-on. Sparks flew from the collision, which produced a terrifying explosion and sent Lin Yun flying away. When he landed on the ground, a cloud of dust rose all around him.

Lin Yun slowly got up from his kneeling position to the shock of the crowd. All of the ridicule that they had from before was gone. Clearly, Luo Kui didn’t hold back with his attack and somehow Lin Yun wasn't destroyed.

Lin Yun knew that his only outcome would be death if he wanted to fight with just his origin energy. So he had to rely on his movement technique and his physique. If he could find an opportunity to bring out the sky sword intent and catch Luo Kui by surprise, he would have a chance to kill his opponent.

However, he would need Luo Kui to act carelessly. Then again, he could use his other identity as Flower Burial and fuse his noble tune and sky sword intent together.

Either way, Lin Yun was getting a better understanding of his strength through this fight. Since he wasn’t fighting with the jade flute, he saw many of his weaknesses.

“I didn’t expect you to have such a strong physique. I’m surprised you blocked my blade. But just so you know, the show has just begun!” Luo Kui said with a sinister expression on his face. As he descended from the sky and clashed with Lin Yun, his attacks became even more ferocious. His crimson aura and blade fused perfectly, creating various phenomena that put Lin Yun in a disadvantageous position. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Sparks continued to fly from the collision, shattering many of Lin Yun’s dragon runes. Although the dragon runes could withstand the attacks from the blade, they couldn’t continuously bear the power of the attacks. Lin Yn’s body was put under great pressure and pain.

“Haha, you really have a tough body!” laughed Luo Kui as his expression became more insane.

The crowd’s hearts began to throb violently as they stared at Lin Yun in amazement. They couldn’t believe how monstrous his talent was to face Luo Kui for so long.

“There’s something weird about that brat,” said Qin Feng as his expression turned grave. Suddenly, he remembered that Lin Yun was the one who discovered him hiding a few days earlier.

“This is Senior Brother Yun’s true strength?” The core disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were dumbfounded as they watched Lin Yun fight, especially Liu Qingyan. He suddenly regretted his inappropriate behavior towards Lin Yun.

When Luo Kui heard the surrounding discussion, his face gradually became ugly because he even heard someone doubt his strength. After all, an Astral Stage should easily deal with a brat in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Luo Kui was enraged by the embarrassment he brought upon himself. Crimson light began to bloom behind him, forming a crimson dragon python. In the end, he couldn’t hold back from bringing out his holy spirit.

“You do have some ability, but it’s a pity that you’ll still die!” When his holy spirit took form, Luo Kui roared and poured his origin energy into his blade. Then, the terrifying crimson dragon python released a sharp howl.

The crimson dragon python fused with Luo Kui’s blade and descended upon Lin Yun. At the same time, the other demonic cultivators felt that Lin Yun was about to die.

Qin Feng smiled at this scene because they were about to make an example out of Lin Yun. After all, even he was afraid of Ye Ziling.

When the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples saw the attack directed toward Lin Yun, all of them became anxious. After all, they no longer had any enmity toward Lin Yun, especially after his barbeque.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party drew their weapons and ignited their fighting spirit. However, a golden light shined out of Lin Yun’s body that dyed the sky golden.

The light baffled the demonic cultivators and froze the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect members. How is a Heavenly Soul Realm executing a holy spirit martial technique? Then, a silver light shined out of Lin Yun’s body as well.

Manifesting the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix, Lin Yun clenched his fist together. In the next second, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind violently while looking at Luo Kui with rage blazing in his pupils. “A clown like you dares to say that there’s no one else in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?!”
