Chapter 509: The Method of Crossing the World

"Zhōng xià." (Summer) The sweet and gentle voice of Wáng Níng Wēi came through the phone.

"Uh?"

Wang's voice was as sweet as honey, and Zhao Xu felt a little hesitant to resist it. He had heard many sweet voices before, but this one was different.

"Can I believe you?"

This question left Zhao Xu a bit confused about Wang's serious tone. He wondered if there was some family conflict that needed to be resolved.

"You're choosing to call me, isn't that already a sign of trust?"

Wang's voice came through the phone, and Zhao Xu suddenly understood that Wang wasn't worried about her daily life.

"I think you're initially a bit wooden, although not smart, but also very reliable. But now you're too smart, so I have to question your reliability."

Wang's words were like a confession over the phone.

From Zhao Xu's limited experience with girls, usually when someone says they doubt his reliability, it means they trust him. But Zhao Xu wouldn't guarantee anything.

"I've always been myself," Zhao Xu said. "I'm not saying I won't sacrifice anything, but my conscience is very high."

Zhao Xu's logic was simple.

Just like someone might bid for a couple to break up, never to see each other again, and if rejected, the price would increase exponentially. Zhao Xu might not always refuse, but his "price" was higher than 99% of people's.

"Why don't you chat with me using text messages, but instead choose to use voice calls?" Wang Jingwei asked.

Zhao Xu listened intently, his emotions fluctuating as if he had stumbled upon a hidden clue in today's phone call.

As he gazed at the 2D poster of the smiling girl on the wall, the distant howling of the evening wind, which echoed through the empty corridors, reminded him that they were already in a real world.

"'Because written words can leave behind a trace, and our voices are less likely to be monitored,'" Zhao Xu said clearly.

They all knew that their chat records were backed up on the internet. Anyone with a good memory could trace back their conversations, especially in chat groups. Even mentioning "key words" would lead to monitoring.

As for "voice calls," the two of them, being innocent people, would never be monitored.

As long as they didn't record their conversation, there would be no trace left in this world.

The only thing that could be traced back was the call records on their phones and the call lists kept by the telecommunications company, which was just a brief "outgoing and incoming call record."

"'You're being so serious, I'm starting to suspect that you're planning to leave this world behind,' Zhao Xu joked, hinting at something.

"'Hmm,'" Wang Jingwei snorted, and Zhao Xu's heart felt like a string had snapped inside him, as if a sharp, buzzing sound was resonating in his ears.

It wasn't until several seconds later that Zhao Xu regained his composure and joked, "'What do you mean?'"

"'I finally understand what you meant by saying we should meet up in person at the end of June - it's that time node, right?' Wang Jingwei said, making Zhao Xu want to shout in his heart: Wang Jingwei, the girl is too smart, she's impossible to marry off.

"'Huh—'"
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he heard the sound of her breathing, which was long and sighed, "There are only three and a half months left, how should I handle this entire set of furniture?"

"Yeah, I just need to find a special resin and rely on the craftsmanship of the five rings, and it's still possible to replicate it."

"That's what I'm chasing in the drama, but how can I handle it?"

Zhou Xu heard these two sentences and could only mutter to himself, "These aren't the main points, after all."

Suddenly, he too forgot to keep secrets. "If tomorrow is the last day, are you only concerned with these things?"

"These are the reasons I want to live well in this world, Zhongxia," Wang Qingwei's voice suddenly took on a strange tone. "When you are too clever and understand the motives and behaviors of people in the world, you will feel that everything is dull."

"If I don't find something I like, I'll be bored to death. The idols on the screen are still more transparent to me than me. I'm definitely not interested in them."

"On the other hand, these paper dolls are so beautiful and simple, you don't need to use your brain to like them."

Zhou Xu originally wanted to ask a question, but then thought that everyone would be together in their journey, and they wouldn't be separated.

He thought for a moment and then asked, "Did you guess something on the half-face of the God of Death?"

"What do you mean, did you guess that Arthur is a real world?"

"This guess has been early. When I touched the magic teaching of Mistral, I started from the theoretical level and learned magic from local wizards in the same way."

"At that time, I noticed the entire magical system, which was surprisingly self-consistent and had an incredibly complex structure."

"The system was vast, logically self-consistent, and detailed. This is the 'impossible triangle' of game content."

Zhou Xu understood after listening.
Here is the translation:

This impossible triangle means that any game content can only achieve two of the three points, wanting a vast system, logical consistency, and detailed realism. It's hard to achieve all three.

Even if a game company wants to create a masterpiece without considering profits, it's difficult to achieve all three.

"Arthur can establish a game on his own using his entire magical system, without the need to expand the world view," Wang Qingwei explained. "From the beginning, it's been like this, uncommon and unreasonable."

"What about the underworld half-face?" Zhao Xu asked.

Actually, it's not hard to guess the cause and effect.

Players come to Arthur, seeing what the gods show them.

Except for Arthur, the world is magnificent and vast, but it's hard to take it as evidence of the world's existence.

Only when the gods can't see or control players in those areas beyond their grasp can they see what they can't.

"It's simple," Wang Qingwei said. "We discovered it through the inconsistency of time flow between the two planes."

Although the time difference between the half-face and Earth is not large, Earth passes one hour, while the half-face passes around 58 minutes.

Zhao Xu was impressed, holding his phone, and said, "So that's it. This discrepancy of three-tenths is generally imperceptible to ordinary people. After spending ten hours in the two worlds, the time difference is only around 20 minutes."

"So I knew that 'time scale' is one of the properties of the plane and exists differently. Unless it's a multiple of the difference, a few percentage points are hard to detect, and I didn't notice this point at the time."

Zhao Xu nodded, feeling amazed.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, what's more critical is that he was in a state of being half-dead in the world of gods, and he didn't bring a watch or a mobile phone that could measure time, nor did he intentionally pay attention to his own subjective time and inner clock.

"Are you relying on a prolonged spell to judge the countdown difference?" Zhao Xu asked.

However, most players who encounter such problems usually just think it's an error and won't realize that they are in a world with a slower time scale.

"This is very simple," Wang Qingwei's voice became slightly low-pitched. "As long as the scale is long enough, and you're in a calm state of mind, you can estimate it by counting your heartbeats. I and Eisweh did multiple experiments and finally realized this point."

As he spoke, Wang Qingwei's voice became slightly lower.

"But, as for the fact that the Earth may be destroyed, I only just learned about it recently. However, the contents they told me were vague, and I only came to this conclusion after repeated analysis."

"Who is it?" Zhao Xu was curious.

This is basically opening up the truth, which is a bold move.

Even Anzhi Noya, who was bound by the "Oath" and had come to the Earth, was only vaguely mentioned a few points to him.

"It's the President of the Mage Association, and I'm the deputy president of the Starfall Guild," Wang Qingwei said.

In this instant, Zhao Xu's chain of guesses was basically complete.

He couldn't help but be astonished, "So what do you think at the end?"

"I want to ask, how did you cross over?"

"Everyone?"

"Can players synchronize?"

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied immediately.

"Yes, Xun, thank you," Wang Qingwei said.

Without saying much, both of them understood what "yes" meant.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu cleared his throat and spoke in a low tone. The entire room was plunged into darkness, illuminated only by the faint light of the phone and the weak glow of the street lamps outside, as well as the moonlight shining down from above.

"'When the sky is filled with falling stars, the crystal barrier will be breached, and Arthur will welcome the billionth generation.'" Zhao Xu spoke the final prediction from the ancient seven gods' prophecy.

The phone on the other end fell silent.

After a long while, Wang Qingwei finally regained her composure. "I just felt a shock. Is this just a simple phrase?"

"No, this is the prophecy of Arthur, and anyone who is the target of the prophecy will be affected. As the chosen people of the prophecy, as long as we are the earthlings who have crossed over, we will feel the impact of the prophecy just by hearing it," Zhao Xu explained.

The previous prophecy had been spreading slowly over the years after Arthur's crossing.

The "feeling of being affected" after hearing the prophecy was spreading the prophecy, and it was stirring up the prophecy to continue spreading.

Suddenly, Wang Qingwei's voice came through the phone, full of incredulity. "So you just did it?"

"No, I just verified it through the prophecy. Even if it's separated by a cosmic barrier, the power of the prophecy still takes effect on Earth."

"You're a good person, Zhong Xia," Wang Qingwei said, realizing for the first time that Zhao Xu had laid the groundwork for the prophecy after hearing it.

"'That is, according to your plan, if we spread this prophecy just before the crossing at the end of June, we can prove that Arthur really exists?'"
