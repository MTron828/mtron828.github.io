Chapter 221: Residual Killing

Shen Nian, who also possessed the "Magic Detection" skill, noticed the dynamic bar prompt and knew that the opponent was casting the "Detection Magic". He behaved just like many "newbies" who recently arrived at the market.

At that moment, a male mage player from a neighboring stall looked over and couldn't help but laugh, as if recalling his past self.

The middle-aged man, who had taken Shen Nian's two bottles of "Antidote", disappeared after that, and he took over this stall.

Since that scoundrel also swindled him out of a one-ring arcane scroll, he could only bear the remaining rent for this stall by struggling to make ends meet.

"You're useless like this," the mage player reminded Zhao Xuan, "You're in a ordinary town where even a 1st-level mage doesn't exist, and you can only rely on a zero-ring spell like 'Detection Magic' to search for treasures."

"But here in the market, there are over ten stalls backed by mages. So, the magical items that emit a magical aura have already been sifted through."

Magical items will emit an aura corresponding to their level.

The intensity of the aura is determined by the caster's level.

Generally, magical items created by casters below level 5 will emit a dim aura that is invisible to the naked eye but can be detected using detection magic.

However, if it's a divine-grade item, it will emit a blinding aura like a strong flashlight shining directly into one's eyes.

At that time, players would usually just cry tears of joy.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

If it's a "magical weapon", aside from its own "magical aura", it can also emit a visible "beam" of light, similar to the "Illumination Technique" used in stage magic. This is also one of the reasons why wielding a "magical weapon" is so impressive, as it eliminates the need for a 2-gold "Illumination Rod" worth of alchemy item.

However, Zhao Xu didn't say much after hearing the other person's words. Even he, who was stationed in Mistral, knew that some powerful guilds could directly find a five-ring mage to cast the "Magical Constant Technique" and solidify the "Detection Magic" instantly.

This would turn the originally difficult process of selecting magical items into a repetitive operation on an assembly line. Even if the "Discernment Technique" skill is powerful enough, it can obtain some information about magical items through the feedback of the "Source of Knowledge" after completing a 30-level difficulty challenge.

While "Detection Magic" is only a zero-ring spell, it can reveal the category of magical discipline, allowing mages to make judgments about many things.

For example, summoned extraterrestrial beings, which are not real entities in themselves, will display characteristics of curse magic when detected by "Detection Magic".

Zhao Xu also knew that once a magical item is damaged or affected by a special method, its magical aura will be suppressed.

For instance, the one-ring illusion "Magical Aura" can suppress the magical aura of an item, deceiving those who use "Detection Magic". Zhao Xu had previously applied a rare magical item to himself.

Most people who try to obtain magical items usually fail, as they often focus on "suspected items" that cannot emit a magical aura.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "identification technique" that can sentence someone to death is too expensive, costing 25 gold coins for the service fee and 100 gold coins for the material costs. However, many times, the things identified are not worth the material costs, let alone the service fee, and can only be re-packaged and sold again.

"You think this is a 'Copper Lion' sculpture?" Shen Nian suddenly said to Zhao Xu, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

Zhao Xu thought the other person must not have touched such magical items before, which is why they would put it on sale here.

It seems that Shen Nian had doubted whether this was a "Copper Lion" before.

Shen Nian's brother had already become a Saint Warrior, and although he would receive the ability to recruit a special mount from the heavens when he reached level 5, he would be gifted a powerful mount by the heavenly authorities, allowing him to live without needing to walk on two legs.

But the Lion itself is challenging, with a level of 4, and is a powerful aid for early players. Not to mention the Ranger and Druid professions, which already have the ability to summon animals, can seamlessly integrate with this magical equipment.

Unlike Zhao Xu, who can only use this equipment to summon a normal creature once.

Shen Nian looked at Zhao Xu's puzzled expression and was unsure whether to explain.

A nearby mage player noticed this scene and chuckled, saying, "Check the base."

Zhao Xu immediately flipped over the sculpture in his hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

When ordinary people get their hands on mysterious items, their first reaction is usually to carefully search for clues on the item, looking for a few words of activation. However, someone like Zhao Xu, who can freely use zero-ring magic, can combine it with the "detective's eye" and use it as a "judgment" spell, allowing him to directly use magic to judge.

It's like finding a mysterious pill on Earth. Others would have to guess its shape and search for packaging nearby, even trying it out. Many adventurers who obtain mysterious "magic potion" do the same.

However, Zhao Xu has already obtained the "analysis report" of the pill's composition using his magic, and knows what it is.

At this point, Zhao Xu noticed that the statue's base had obvious damage. Logically, if there was a password, it would be most suitable to place it at the bottom of the base. However, the password was indeed destroyed.

"This is the lowest-level 'counterfeit method' in the market. Intentionally destroy the password in its location, making the buyer think that the seller is foolish and can't find the secret. Then they will try to find a common password to break it, or even spend hundreds of gold coins to identify it and get the real password."

"Then they will be foolish, realizing that this thing is just a worthless trinket."

"Ah, these statues are basically common in this market. Unfortunately, there are not enough foolish people lately, making this item unsellable."

The mage player, seemingly bored with selling things, explains to Zhao Xu. However, Shen Nian's face turns red with anger and says, "My brother is not foolish, you know."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's indeed, my sister's stall has a pretty obvious fake statue, and he can spend 50 gold coins to buy another similar-looking statue, which is just bad luck, I suppose. The mage player can't help but complain.

At this time, Zhao Xu also understood.

As a saint warrior, Shen Ze, as the spokesperson for defending justice, was actually deceived by a low-level fake bronze lion statue and spent money on it.

It's estimated that he only realized it after seeing his sister's stall with similar fake products, and he thought he got a good deal, but it turned out he paid a tax on his intelligence.

Later, Shen Ze became the core position of the "Godly Guardian" knight team in the temple of the just and punitive gods in the Winter City, and was basically a strong candidate to become the team leader.

He can be said to be a prominent figure in the Winter City, and his name is likely to be listed as a core member of the temple.

After all, most powerful figures in their youth have had their share of losses.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but think this way.

"How many levels is your older brother?" Zhao Xu asked involuntarily.

A first-level saint warrior shouldn't be worrying about riding a mount yet, and hasn't even earned enough money to buy a saddle.

Riding a charge is a very powerful close-range combat method, especially after coordinating with a long-range support team, which can output terrifying damage.

In the past, Iron Stone, who wore full-body armor, relied on a single long spear to defeat several opponents in the battle array, and was eventually killed by Zhao Xu's "Magic Missile" spell that ignored armor.

"He just reached level 2 yesterday," Shen Nian explained."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, that player who had previously not said much suddenly looked astonished, with his mouth agape, staring at Shen Nian, "Isn't it? Your brother wasn't just a wizard who canceled his mage title to become a saint warrior last month? How did he manage to level up to 2 already in just over half a month?"

Shen Nian then smiled slightly, "He's just naturally talented, wasn't he? He was summoned to 'Star Lake' yesterday and became 2nd level already."

"I'm telling you, your brother's leveling speed is crazy. If he had read that 'Novice Decree' article earlier and gave up being a mage to become a saint warrior, he would have broken through 3rd level by now, setting a new record."

A nearby mage player couldn't help but admire, "But how could he do that? There's still that one mage who jumped from 1st to 4th level, looking down on us ordinary players. He's keeping an eye on the ranking list."

Shen Nian quickly pointed out this point. "Hey, I don't know how that big shot leveled up, and I'm just a novice who's still stuck in the apprentice stage, not knowing where to enter. People are really incomparable now. They're all telling me to give up on the specialized route."

The mage player then sighed and looked down, saying, "Ah, I don't know."

Zhao Xu heard the conversation and couldn't help but ask, "Novice Decree?"

He didn't even get to ask about "Star Lake" yet.

Shen Nian then smiled and said, "Yeah, my brother saw the last decree, 'If you want to sacrifice yourself for faith, become a saint warrior.' He just got carried away and canceled his mage title, otherwise he would have continued to waver for another half a month."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu was taken aback.

Originally, he thought he was inferior to "Mistral" and that the butterfly effect of the post was negligible.

Now it seems that those few posts have generated a huge ripple effect.
Here is the translation:

It was Shen Zhe, an old acquaintance from the Winter City, who relied on his thoughtless post to make his decision half a month in advance, choosing the Saint Warrior route. How many players in the world changed their original choices because of his post?

As Zhao Xu was about to explain the "Copper Lion Eagle" statue in his hand, a street vendor boy suddenly ran in and shouted: "Something big has happened! A mysterious three-ring mage has just appeared at the Wine Tavern, and with a fireball spell, he wiped out the 'Wolran' gang, killing everyone. Now they're all hiding in the temple, too afraid to come out."
