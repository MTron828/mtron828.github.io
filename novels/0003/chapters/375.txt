Chapter 376: The Gift of Parting

As Zhao Xu walked towards the office of Novaia, his mind was still reeling from the astonishing "history" described by Vivian.

Mysterious appearances and disappearances.
Flying high above his imagination, especially the point that "Ernest" might not be dead, which deeply shocked him.

If the other party appeared, it would mean that the current power structure would inevitably lead to changes. Even the current position of the first person in the magic domain of the Sisilvina would no longer be secure.

The most obvious impact would be that the magic and divine power would face extreme suppression when facing Ernest.

However, when Zhao Xu saw Novaia, he found that the other party was in the reception room outside, discussing with four or five male mages.

Some of them looked grave, their voices raised several decibels.

"Someone has been calling you 'miss', and you think you're really a miss, can you act so recklessly?"

"That secret inheritance is ours, the Itel family's, you're just a guardian, temporarily responsible for managing it."

The leader of the middle-aged mage even had a vein bulging on his forehead, scolding Novaia harshly.

As he spoke, the three or four people behind him couldn't help but stand up.

Among them, the youngest one looked pale, his limbs thin, and it was unclear whether it was due to drinking or research on magic. He coughed lightly and said, "That new disciple of yours, is it Zhan Xia? Someone recognized someone from the family last time, and he was wearing the 'star battle cloak' from the family treasure trove."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Once, you advised us young ones from this family to wait for the right moment to come before claiming the inheritance from our family's lost legacy. However, what you're doing now is clearly not what you said. After he finished speaking, the sickly man's companions around him also looked displeased.

Annie, who has reached the legendary stage, has been an object of admiration for the young ones in the family since childhood. Even those who have never seen her in person have fallen in love with her just by hearing her voice.

The nickname 'older sister' is a term used by the family elders to refer to Annie, and it has been passed down through generations. However, since Annie took in a novice player a few months ago, the young ones from the Ither family have noticed that everything has changed. Originally, each month's family gathering would take place without fail, but now Annie has started missing these gatherings.

The Ither family, which has managed to maintain its influence despite the kingdom's downfall, relies heavily on its collective strength. Even a legendary mage like Annie wouldn't dare do something so reckless. The family elders have always cherished the memory of the kingdom's past glory and have been hoping to revive it in their lifetime.

As for the reason why the family's inheritance has not been activated, they all know and understand it.

Who would have thought that the other party would give away the priceless 'Stellar Cloak' to a novice mage without consulting the family?

It's as if the secret inheritance is Annie's personal property.

Annie noticed Zhao Xu's arrival and waved her hand impatiently, signaling the others to leave."
Here is the translation of the text:

The five members of the Itel family, who had come to visit, still had a lot to say in their hearts, but they also knew the significance of the tower, especially since their opponent was a legendary wizard. Despite this, the elder Itel family members saw the gesture of permission to leave and quietly turned around to leave.

As they walked away, the fat wizard who was following behind muttered to himself, "The family elder has gone through the family records. She's not the younger sister of the founding king, and she's not even a princess."

Zhao Xun was taken aback and didn't expect to see a dispute between An Ti Noya and the young members of the Itel family before he left. "Teacher?" Zhao Xun asked, although he knew he shouldn't worry about it.

An Ti Noya shook her head. "You're laughing at a joke."

Zhao Xun felt relieved when he heard her tone, which showed no concern about what had just happened.

If Zhao Xun hadn't heard the rumors from the demon knight Vivian, he would have thought that An Ti Noya was really like what she was accused of being. However, it turned out that it wasn't what the young members of the Itel family had described.

"Teacher, what's the relationship between the Itel family and you?" Zhao Xun asked.

At this point, Zhao Xun already knew that the title "older sister" came from her being the successor of King Ernest of Ophir. This identity was not denied by anyone in the upper echelons of the Floating City.

However, she was not a princess of the Itel dynasty. Even if she was a first-generation or last-generation princess, her status was still not enough to be called "older sister" by people like Rayan.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Especially, the heritage treasure of the Itel royal family is indeed the "false library" where Ernest's initial secrets were hidden.

The question is, how did this "false library" become the possession of the Itel family, and even the young family members are so concerned about it.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also vaguely recalled the time when he first called An Ti Niya, and her surname was indeed Itel.

At this moment, An Ti Niya was smiling with a hint of annoyance: "I'll take a look at how many people will come out to oppose me this time, and get rid of all these wolves in sheep's clothing at once."

Wolves in sheep's clothing?

Zhao Xu's mind jumped over this phrase, and corresponding guesses arose.

"Zhong Xia, do you think who first used the name Itel?" An Ti Niya asked with a smile at this moment.

An Ti Niya's fame can be traced back thousands of years ago, while the Itel royal family's events only occurred a thousand years ago.

"So it's definitely you, the mentor," Zhao Xu replied without a moment's thought.

"So..."

An Ti Niya lightly bit her lips at this moment: "Those birds don't want to think about the glory of the surname itself, which comes from me."

"Itel's founding ancestor, who was once a driver for Ernest, had no name or surname at the time. He found the name Joie and was told by Ernest that he still lacked a surname, so he was allowed to take the surname of the driver and me, making him a family member."

"After the driver Joie returned to his homeland thousands of years later, he discovered that his former lover had been waiting for him at home and had never married, dying old and alone."

"So Joie wanted to find a way to revive his old lover and marry her, establishing a dynasty and leaving a legacy."

At this moment, An Ti Niya stood up and gazed at the snowflakes outside the glass.
Here is the translation:

At the beginning, the secret inheritance, which was actually a fake treasure map, was lent to Joie by me. Later, the kingdom was destroyed, and Joie naturally returned the treasure map to me unchanged, without telling the Itel family about it.

When he heard this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but slightly open his mouth in surprise.

This means that what those young people were thinking inside was all just their personal imagination.

From the beginning, this treasure map had no relation to Joie, the founder of the kingdom.

The lost treasure, the Itel family, was truly unable to recover it.

Zhao Xu also couldn't help but shake his head and sigh, fearing that those young people who had just provoked Anniya had already mentally divided everything about the lost treasure map.

"Teacher, are you fishing?" Zhao Xu guessed.

Although the previous few people's gazes had subtly pointed at him, Zhao Xu didn't care.

Since he knew that the Itel family members were not related to Anniya, he didn't care at all.

However, he had never felt the power of the former Ernest's authority before.

Just because he had driven a carriage for him, he could live forever, and even thousands of years later, he could still rely on the shadow to become a founding monarch.

"Are you fishing?"

Anniya lightly glanced at Zhao Xu, "Childish."

"I already have the power to turn over the entire chessboard, so I won't pay attention to how the pieces are arranged. Instead, their provocation has made me feel quite interesting."

"They can't even guess when I appear, which shows that they have no connection to the Itel family's oldest tombkeepers. They're just small fry, thinking they represent the new generation."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Moreover, don't you think you're getting too complacent in this floating city? Having a few more troublemakers would probably promote your progress, wouldn't they?"

Zhao Xu was taken aback that An Xinyue had such thoughts.

If there hadn't been a concentrated "Mysterious Saint Warrior" standing silently by, Zhao Xu would have spat out bitter words at An Xinyue.

Originally, he had come to blow off some steam and see if he could get his hands on a magical item. Who would have thought that he would be counter-attacked instead.

"Teacher, weren't you also trained in a similar way?" Zhao Xu asked, trying to calm himself down.

"What are you talking about? My teacher used to lavish me with attention," An Xinyue said with a smug smile.

As she spoke, she walked back to her spacious office and pulled out a thick stack of parchment from within.

"Take these, they're your employment documents, as well as the route and key points for your next mission."

Zhao Xu took the documents from her.

Under the terms of the association, if he didn't do well, the association would take drastic measures to recover the investment.

Zhao Xu was also clear that he had to take the initiative in the final stretch. The association was also trying to get some bookish wizards to understand the hardships of the mortal world.

"There's a letter inside that needs to be delivered to the leader of the Northern Alliance when the time comes. And you'll be transmitting to Luca City, which is adjacent to the Northern Alliance. Currently, there's tension between the two, and there are a lot of refugees on the border. You'll need to take care of yourself when you return."

An Xinyue instructed Zhao Xu, saying that she would personally visit him again in Star City in about ten days or half a month to check on his progress.

"That's it, teacher, if there's nothing else, I'll set off then?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is it, actually, you still have a reward that hasn't been settled yet, and I'll hand it over to you, and we'll discuss it together."

Reward?

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat when he heard the word "reward". Anniya smiled sweetly at Zhao Xu.

"You didn't take the initiative to help the church solve the demon priest's problem, did you?" Anniya asked, glancing at the demon warrior standing in the corner.

Vivian's expression remained unchanged.

"You were able to put life and death aside at the time, so the reward you received also allows you to avoid one unexpected death."

"This is a permanent spell that triggers when triggered. Can you guess what it is?"

Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise, "Contract Series?"

"Ah, you're quite clever. It seems that the previous scroll space was not wasted."

Anniya acknowledged, "The 'Death Contract' spell of the Eight Ring God, with a casting cost of 1000 gold diamonds."

Anniya then introduced the spell, and Zhao Xu even reacted faster.

The Contract Series spell is one of the few spells that exceeds the original "minute" and "wheel" level limitations, and directly continues to last until triggered.

It can be said that once used, it brings lifelong benefits, truly a "wake-up buff".

The only effect of the spell is that when the caster dies, it automatically casts a "complete revival" spell on them.

So, the temple rewarded Zhao Xu with an extra life last time.

However, this "Death Contract" is naturally inferior to the Revival Stone.

Giving up two points of physical attribute is the price of having the "Death Contract" spell on one's body.

"You can choose whether to accept this reward." Anniya smiled sweetly at Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't even think about it, "Definitely, no way to give up without a fight." With 14 attributes, he could still bear the loss of 2 attributes.

When Zhao Xu said that, An Ni Yao lightly tapped her finger and cast a spell.

Along with a warm energy permeating, Zhao Xu's panel information popped up directly.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have been affected by An Ni Yao's spell, "Death Covenant" (Ring 8), "Restoration Covenant" (Ring 7), and "Brave Covenant" (Ring 5).】

The first spell was good, but the latter two were somewhat unexpected for Zhao Xu.

"You're going to that chaotic region this time, although Saint Warrior is protecting you, but I'll add two more safeguards for you, and it's just a one-time thing," An Ni Yao said calmly.

For the "Death Covenant" (Ring 8), it directly triggered a full recovery spell, which was completely beyond Zhao Xu's expectations.

The "Restoration Covenant" (Ring 7) was triggered when Zhao Xu received negative states such as attribute damage or poisoning, and the spell directly removed the negative effects.

Zhao Xu effectively gained an automatic opportunity to cancel negative states.

The "Brave Covenant" (Ring 5) was triggered when his life value was below half, and he gained 5 HP recovery per level, reduced damage by 5, and increased luck by 4 levels.

At this time, An Ni Yao lightly walked over and first placed her hand on Zhao Xu's shoulder, saying, "Zhong Xia, good luck! If you can find the secret of the underworld of the Star Lake, I'll grant you a wish."
