Chapter 061: Ayn Stone

The entire vast library was eerily quiet, and Zhao Xu had chosen a relatively secluded corner. Even as the crowd began to trickle in, no one paid any attention to them here.

After Zhao Xu revealed his choice, he could feel his heart racing with nervous tension.

"Ah? Go on, why?" Anzhiya spoke in a calm tone.

Zhao Xu wasn't sure if it was just his imagination, but he seemed to sense Anzhiya's face beneath her cloak for the first time.

"I don't know anything about the power of a mage," Zhao Xu thought for a moment before retracting his words.

"It seems you really have faith in me," Anzhiya nodded slightly.

"With the 'Mental Delay' specialization, a spell that lasts over 24 hours using the 'Reading Magic' skill requires at least 72 levels of magical proficiency. Since the Calamity Era, even 40-level mages are hard to come by, let alone 30-level ones."

Anzhiya's tone became somewhat languid, as if she had been reminded of some past event.

"You're right," Anzhiya said, and the green cloth bag on the table suddenly flew into her hands.

Zhao Xu was now struck with incredulity.

"Teacher, teacher? You're not joking, are you? 72 levels?"

Everyone, including all players, native inhabitants, and even monsters, has a specific character card. There is no abstract concept of existence!

In the past, when players were clueless, the most arrogant slogan was: "As long as you know the character card content, you can kill even a god."
Here is the translation of the text:

Anniya could reach level 72 of the caster, and each level would be clear and evident, allowing others to replicate it. This shocked Zhao Xu so much that he didn't even bother to open the package on the table. "Correct me, but the caster level is the caster level, and the spellcaster level is the spellcaster level," he said.

"You can determine how many levels of magic you can cast based on your caster level, but the spellcaster level determines the effect of the spell, and it's possible to upgrade it," Anniya said calmly.

Zhao Xu finally began to understand, and he realized why there were two different terms. He needed to upgrade his caster level to become a high-level person. However, the spellcaster level could be upgraded through equipment and abilities.

Even a 1st-level caster could cast a "reading magic" spell that lasted for 20-30 minutes if their spellcaster level was upgraded.

"Didn't you know about the 'Spellguard' profession? Its 5th-level ability is to upgrade the spellcaster level by one level," Anniya said.

Zhao Xu smiled awkwardly, recalling that he had heard of this before, but didn't know the details.

"Open it up and see what rewards you've chosen," Anniya said.

Zhao Xu nodded and directly opened the package in front of him.

A transparent stone in the shape of a spinning top?

A faint suspicion flashed through Zhao Xu's mind, causing his hands to tremble slightly.

"This is an Ayn Stone," Anniya said. "Hold it and release it to use it. Ayn Stones of different colors and shapes have different effects. This one allows you to sustain life without food or water."

When Zhao Xu heard the words "Ayn Stone," he almost jumped up.
Here is the translation of the text:

This renowned magical item, Aizen Stone, has been coveted by him since his previous life. Although it's not the strongest, its effects when equipped are absolutely stunning.

In this life, Zhao Xu is single-mindedly seeking strength. He looks down on such pure visual effects and is more concerned with whether the item itself is powerful.

When he heard the effect "can sustain life without water and food," he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

It's useful, after all, but it takes a year to show its effects.

Currently, these players are all projections, directly eating and drinking in the real world. Arthur's body is just a projection, not even needing to go to the bathroom.

Other players who receive this item will initially think they can't use it.

However, no matter what, this item will definitely demonstrate its value in a year.

Unfortunately, Anneth Noya gave him Howard's convenient bag and warned him not to sell the things she gave him. Otherwise, Zhao Xu could exchange it for 4000 GP in the future.

"Discontent?" Anneth Noya asked with a hint of amusement.

Zhao Xu shook his head quickly, "No, very satisfied."

"What do you think is inside the blue bag?" Anneth Noya asked.

"Yeah, still quite interested."

Zhao Xu nodded, regardless of what's inside, he won't regret it.

This transparent spindle-shaped item is the cheapest in the Aizen Stone series, and the blue-wrapped thing can't be another Aizen Stone.

Anneth Noya gently lifted the blue cloth, and a pearl dropped out.

Zhao Xu took a close look, and it was a pearl similar to the one he used for "identification art" yesterday, estimated to be worth no more than a few hundred gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

He thought to himself, "From 100 GP to 4000 GP, the difference is too great." "This is a level one mana recovery pearl that can restore a used level one spell slot. So, you shouldn't think that a mage has used up all their spell slots. You never know how many they have in reserve." Zhao Xu smiled and looked at the mage, not daring to take the risk.

Even a dead mage might still pose a threat, not to mention a living one. As for those recorded scrolls, magic wands, and staffs, who knows how many more secrets they might hold. "Do you want this mana recovery pearl?" Anzhiya suddenly asked, and Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat.

He felt a sense of incredulity, as if he was being told a joke. Was he truly the legendary chosen one? No, he should be the one chosen by the world. He picked up the golden axe head, as if he could still use the silver axe head. The level one mana recovery pearl was equivalent to increasing the current player's level one spell slots by one. Many players now had only two or three level one spell slots, and it would directly increase by 33% to 50%.

"Yes, that's fine," Anzhiya nodded, but then put the mana recovery pearl back in her dimensional bag. The whole process was so smooth that Zhao Xu hadn't even had time to blink. "Teacher?" Zhao Xu asked slowly.

"Yes?" "What are you doing?" Zhao Xu asked awkwardly. "Oh, I think this level one mana recovery pearl is too ordinary. But since you want it, it still has some value, so I'll reluctantly leave it here, taking up space."
Zhao Xu gazed at the dimensional bag carried by An Ti Nuo Ya, and without thinking, he knew it was undoubtedly the most expensive fourth-level dimensional bag. In his impression, others would boast that this dimensional bag had a capacity of 7 cubic meters, capable of holding over half a ton.

He thought of his Howard's handy bag, which had a total of 300 liters of space, less than 0.3 cubic meters. The water bottle on the market was 18.9 liters, and he could fit ten or so of them in his 300-liter bag. So, 0.3 cubic meters was indeed not small.

And yet, the space of 7 cubic meters was equivalent to the size of a single-person hotel room bed, from the bed frame to the ceiling.

Was it really necessary to waste space for a pearl?

It was clear that he was just teasing this poor and struggling young mage.
