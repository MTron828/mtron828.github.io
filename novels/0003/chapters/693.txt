Chapter 694: The Essence of the Deep Abyss Demon

"Identity?" Zheng Xin Yu was astonished. They had decided to go through the transmission portal to conceal their identities this time.

How could they suddenly decide to do that? And Zhao Xu, who had experienced more adventures, quickly reacted, "So, you're saying we're going to a realm where a deity resides?"

For the strong, these old-fashioned adventurers who had entered through official channels were often overlooked.

Even their ordinary adventurer identity, which came from Arthur, could serve as a shield.

Now, they were essentially choosing to go through customs inspection at the border instead of smuggling in directly.

"It's not the realm of the deities, after all. Many of those divine realms exist as sub-realms and are hard to find. But I do want to enter a realm where a deity's followers reside," Anzhiya explained.

As Anzhiya spoke, her gaze fell to the vast, bottomless chasm beneath the tunnel.

"Our next target will be to reach the transmission portal that leads to the 66th layer of the deep abyss."

The 66th layer of the deep abyss, the net of demons.

As they walked alongside the main tunnel of the deep abyss, no matter whether they looked up or down, the tunnel stretching out before them was filled with broken bridges and various abandoned towers, leaning against the tunnel at an angle.

These structures were extremely old.

The same sight caught their eyes, including the shattered bodies of demons and remains of various creatures, including humans, which had become obstacles blocking their path.

The demons that died in this deep abyss were considered to have died completely.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Unless a powerful demon takes notice or receives the favor of the abyss, there is no hope for revival. Zhao Xu gazed at the fortress of the abyss, with most of them connected by bridges to other forts, but there is no connection between forts of different heights. Looking up at the extremely steep cliff, it's impossible to maintain balance without at least 20 climbing skills. Attempting to go down would be like offering one's soul to the demon.

Furthermore, as Anzhi said, the ancient demon Obris had at least a common protocol for using the abyss. However, in the current era of the devil's realm, there is no consensus. Most demons stationed to guard the teleportation gate will stay at their posts and live their own lives, but some demons may still lose control and attack their enemies, all for the sake of some fun.

Waiting for demons to take their responsibilities seriously is like waiting for LSP to achieve enlightenment and enter a celibate state. When encountering non-demons, these guardians will become extremely aggressive and launch a surprise attack.

The abyss is essentially a boundless battlefield!

Countless adventurers come to this realm of teleportation gates, all of whom will nervously sneak into their target areas.

"It seems that flying creatures can now fly freely at this level," Zhao Xu commented.

"No mistake," Anzhi said, and as she did, she casually applied a flying spell to Yu'er, and two intangible wings appeared behind her.

"From now on, follow me, control your output, and Zhang Xia will take on the role of a warrior, while Yu'er and I will take on the role of rangers," Anzhi said, and then snapped her fingers.
Here is the translation of the text:

Instantly, the adventurer attire of the three people on their bodies underwent a significant transformation, with crossbows and composite longbows appearing in their hands.

Next, Anniya gave Allen a few spells, instantly turning her into a qualified ranger.

At the same time, Anniya pulled out a scroll from her bosom, unrolled it, and said, "This is a map of the deep abyss that I bought from the fortress of Pazania. Although it's more reliable than the market in Azgaroth, it's not entirely accurate. We can only explore the way to the 66th layer transmission portal by following this map."

Zhao Xu's eyes raised slightly, and he remembered that Anniya also possessed those dark scrolls, which had the key feature of being accurate and able to change according to actual circumstances.

So, Anniya was simulating a realistic scenario for them three to be ordinary adventurers?

So, when teaming up with others, wouldn't he be able to command two people, and even sleep in the same tent at night?

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu's heart began to anticipate.

"Zhōng Xià!" (Summer Solstice)

Looking at Zhao Xu's somewhat dazed eyes, Anniya couldn't help but reprimand him with a gentle touch on the map.

"That transmission portal is guarded by the Zhōul, which, although it believes in the spider-like Roise, is fundamentally a spider-like evil demon. However, the evil Zhōul in the deep abyss are not free to roam, and therefore, there are frequent battles outside the fortress."

Zheng Xin Yu began to realize Anniya's plan and finally understood why a small team would be equipped with a warrior and two rangers.

If the priest were to take the stage, it was likely that they would have a big battle with these Zhōul.

Although it was possible that they would take action without saying a word, at least there was a 50% chance.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Anzhi Noya continued to say, 'Those portals are essentially two-way, with a circular pool of pale, soft mud formed from the flowing water on the cliffside. The best approach is to convince the Zhol to please the spider, allowing us to enter. This way, we also obtain the 'road guide'. If we can't convince them, we'll force our way through the portal.'"

"She also unfolded the map of the target portal and had Zhao Xu and the others memorize it.

Although the entire process looked a bit awkward, Anzhi Noya could effortlessly use the 'interdimensional portal' to reach the 66th floor directly.

After arriving at the destination through this seemingly awkward method, even if they were intruders, the initial pressure would be relatively low.

After all, three people who couldn't even master transmission or interdimensional portal techniques were hardly impressive.

Zhao Xu also looked out at the distant fortress, where a team of Flomago was patrolling outside the fortress.

If these demons gained the ability to teleport through interdimensional portals, it was unknown what the entire Arthurian world would use to block them.

It was no wonder that the seal of the demon war in the previous era resulted in the deaths of many innocent civilians.

These bloodthirsty and ruthless beings should not have been born in this world.

'Understood, then it's up to you, Zhongxia, to lead the way,' Anzhi Noya said.

At this point, the three people were hiding in a secret path in the main tunnel of the deep abyss, with a giant boulder hiding their tracks.

Zhao Xu also directly changed roles and began to analyze as the team leader: 'Although there are limited number of strongholds at the same level, there is no need to go out there so boldly.'"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As he pointed to the steep cliff, "These overhanging cliffs, although few people dare to climb, still have many hidden spots after being weathered by time. We can use these locations as emergency landing points and descend to the 66th floor transmission portal level as much as possible."

Then, the three of them began to coordinate their actions, with Zhao Xu giving everyone a stealth spell, and they flew to the next landing point like a speed descent.

Although the powerful demons in the deep abyss also have the ability of true knowledge, they are not constantly monitoring this deep abyss tunnel 24/7, and their field of vision is limited.

To avoid making sounds during communication, the three of them also linked their minds using the "mind link" technique, allowing them to communicate silently in their minds.

During this period, they encountered several sharp cliffs, and if it weren't for AnTiya's timely use of her telekinetic ability to break these stone spikes, otherwise, Loer would have been slashed by them on the spot, which made Zhao Xu even more cautious of the dangers of this deep abyss.

In the end, this bottomless abyss was filled with corrosive acid lakes, toxic fog, and cave systems with long nails, as well as instant-killing salt deserts, silent poisonous winds, and vast bug plains.

This environment of scorched earth is not suitable for living, and it's impossible to use Arthur's adventure logic to deduce.

Zhao Xu and the other two successfully landed without any danger, repeatedly reaching the designated target points on the map.

However, after reaching a secret alleyway, Zhao Xu discovered a recently deceased demon corpse lying on the ground.

"It's a cowardly demon," Zhao Xu judged.

"It's probably a recent battle, and this might be a pursuit battle?" Loer analyzed.

At the moment, the three of them stood in a very narrow location, with giant stone statues on both sides, and only a narrow path in the middle that was wide enough for one person.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just this small, timid demon can barely make it through. 'This demon has fled to this place with injuries, but it seems it won't survive.' Anzemo glanced over and analyzed the entire situation.

Zhao Xu looked at the demon's back and could faintly see the trail of its distant footprints. He immediately understood Anzemo's reasoning.

He also explained to Yiren, 'This level 2 challenge demon can only rely on its own damage reduction ability to survive in battles and evolve into higher-level demons.'

'This demon's only strategy is to use the human wave tactic. Unless a powerful demon is pressing down, these demons will scatter in disarray if they lose the battle.'

As Zhao Xu spoke, he revealed a strange expression, 'It is this instinct that earns these demons the name "timid demon". However, these demons are more afraid of higher-level demons than death itself.'

The timid demon muttered to itself, but it could still use its surprise attack and stinky cloud skills every day. Moreover, the timid demon could summon other timid demons.

If we put this on the main material plane, relying on these three skills is enough to threaten ordinary villages, which is also the reason why demons can cause massive losses.

Yiren listened to Zhao Xu's explanation and finally understood, 'So this timid demon has fled to this place, and it may still be fighting. Should we avoid drawing attention to ourselves?'

'Wait a minute,' Zhao Xu said, 'The wounds on this demon's body don't seem to be from weapons, but rather from monster bites. It doesn't matter anyway.'

Zhao Xu was not afraid of the timid demon, even if there were ten thousand more of them. He would just wipe them out with a spell.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

It's crucial to note that any sudden battle in the deepest depths could attract more attention, potentially leading to a loss of control and triggering the interest of powerful demons lurking in the shadows, ultimately bringing about the arrival of the demon lord.

"Where do demons originate from?" asked Zhao Xu, prompting the question, which seemed simple but was beyond his qualifications to answer.

This was akin to asking about the origin of humanity, a question that had sparked debate among scientists and scholars, with various theories and consensus forming over time.

As for demons, their history was far more ancient and complex, with even modern-day deities unable to trace their origins back to the beginning.

Discussing the source of demons was beyond Zhao Xu's knowledge and expertise, exceeding the scope of his religious studies.

Anshinyo thoughtfully nodded, saying, "According to the current consensus of our organization, these demons were born from the void and its endless layers."

"According to the initial creator of the Dark Tome, Arum, demons are an extension of chaos. They are also gods, devils, and other powerful beings who have entered other planes to establish their domains, or have occupied this chaotic land and left behind remnants on the ground."

"It is precisely from chaos that demons originate, making it difficult to count their various kinds?"

Zhao Xu responded instinctively.

Anshinyo nodded in agreement, saying, "That's right. The scholar, in his later years, became frustrated with the task of establishing a comprehensive system for demon physiology and could only confirm a few commonalities."

At this moment, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a pleasant buzzing in his ears, as if a tiny feather was tickling his eardrums, gently stroking his ears.
Here is the translation of the text:

After a moment of shock, he exclaimed, "If the demon originates from chaos, then shouldn't it lack this fuzzy commonality? This is, after all, a manifestation of order."

Zhao Xu's mind transmission seemed to reverberate like a bell, shaking the minds of the other two people.

The seemingly circular argument, however, directly pointed out the logical contradiction.

Anyone can have a commonality, but the demon representing the abyss and the typical representative of the abyssal army do not have the qualification for such commonality.

Other biological species are impoverished and lack any commonality, but the demon species of the abyss are countless and strange, yet they actually possess a few inevitable commonalities!

It was as if they had made a pact.

Anzhiya's breath also stopped suddenly, and she didn't expect Zhao Xu to be so concerned about this point.

After gazing at Zhao Xu with a strange expression, he explained, "So we can only draw one conclusion."

"The bottomless abyss beneath our feet yearns for chaos and evil. It utilizes the power of the creator to try to make more parts of this world return to their original birthplace."

"Therefore, the abyss grants demons the most suitable commonality for spreading chaos and evil. They are a kind of copy."

"This is the essence of demons. You know that, don't say anything nonsense."
