Chapter 276: The Song of the Dead

"Rasksh, do your artifacts also like to eat spiders?" Zhao Xu said, looking puzzled.

"Uh, I'm suggesting it to you, master," Rasksh replied. "If we use the 'Flying Technique' from the Three-Ring System, the cost would be too high. You currently have only two Three-Ring Techniques, and even if you merge the four Two-Ring Techniques into two Three-Ring Techniques, you'll only have four Three-Ring Techniques in total."

"So, master, are you willing to use it now?" Rasksh asked, trying to stifle a smile.

Zhao Xu furrowed his brow at this. He had not yet used up all his ability points, which would naturally be consumed when he leveled up to level 5. However, starting from level 5, he would receive half of the ability points he had at level 5, so he now had 7 ability points.

As Zhao Xu had discovered the secret to using his ability points through the infinite ability points shortcut, he also learned more about ability points.

The simplest way to use ability points was to consume them to enhance his knowledge and insight, which he had done during his time in the Mysterious Forest.

In general, any ability that required a performance level of 1-20 could be enhanced by consuming ability points, resulting in an additional 1-6 (1D6) level of enhancement.

When Zhao Xu reached level 8, consuming one ability point would result in an additional 2-12 (2D6) level of enhancement, with a target level of around 7.

By level 15, consuming one ability point would result in an additional 3-18 (3D6) level of enhancement, with a target level of around 10.
Here is the translation:

At that time, Zhao Xu's consumption of spiritual energy points made his sword skills equivalent to those of an additional 10 elite warriors. However, currently, he can save three spell slots by consuming just one spiritual energy point.

"Master, there is a divine aura here. I suggest you sacrifice yourself for the greater good," Larks continued to entice.

If they could become divine, even if it meant consuming some kind of excrement, Arthur's team would be unstoppable. Not to mention just a single spider.

But Zhao Xu was different.

"Larks, I've mastered all the spells from one to three rings. If a mage can only solve a problem with one approach, then the reason is that his spells are too few," Zhao Xu said in frustration.

At this point, he approached the wall, feeling the ruggedness of the wall and the length of the corridor stretching out before him.

"Ah, Master, you're not thinking of using the first-ring divine spell 'Step by Step,' are you? Although this spell can give you a 10-level bonus to balance, climb, jump, and flip skills."

"But even with some handholds or standing points on the wall, the climbing difficulty would exceed 20 levels. Not to mention that you can't just whip out some wall anchors to create handholds and standing points. Those shadows wouldn't be dumb, and zombies wouldn't be clever enough to use tools to climb the wall."

Zhao Xu was clear about this. He didn't need wall anchors, and relying solely on the gaps in the brick-and-stone wall to climb would make the difficulty level at least 25. With the "Step by Step" spell providing a 10-level bonus and combining it with his own 1-20 level climbing performance, the probability of successfully climbing the wall was still quite low.
Here is the translation:

However, it's fortunate that the wall surface is not entirely smooth.
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to use his skills to climb a million stairs.
"Lakshmi, improve your climbing skills, and don't just rely on one spell. Remember, the variety of spells is the reason why wizards are powerful," Zhao Xu said.
"Who said that?" Lakshmi thought to herself, mimicking the action of scratching her head.

Throughout the centuries of wizards, there have been those with similar meanings, but the wording is slightly different.

"Oh, Wizard Summer," Zhao Xu joked.

He then reached into the pockets of his robe, which he had sewn himself, and pulled out a small capsule. He crushed it in his hand, and suddenly, a drop of liquid flowed from the tree sap into his palm. Zhao Xu began to cast a spell - the unique "Wall Gecko" spell.

【Adventure Wizard Summer, your climbing skills have been enhanced by 20 levels, with a duration of 5 minutes (1 minute per level)】
Instantly, Zhao Xu's mind was filled with a plethora of climbing movements. His limbs seemed to be equipped with auxiliary mechanical hands, and as soon as he made a mistake in his climbing posture, this power would immediately correct it.

In the blink of an eye, after the effects of this spell took hold, Zhao Xu became a master-level expert in climbing skills.

The "Wall Gecko" spell can initially enhance 10 levels, and it's only at level 5 that it enhances 20 levels. By the time he reaches level 9, it enhances 30 levels. At that point, even if the wall gap is as small as a needle's eye, Zhao Xu could still climb it effortlessly.

At this point, with the enhancement of his 20-level climbing skills, Zhao Xu directly grasped the wall gap with his bare hands and jumped up into the air.
This scene left Rakshasa looking somewhat perplexed, "What's going on? This wall-climbing technique is from which year? I just didn't think of it just now." However, Zhao Xu's expression changed, indicating that he had not transformed into his corresponding divine artifact, and Rakshasa was not omniscient in all aspects.

Slowly, Zhao Xu didn't have time to think anymore.

Just then, the shadows behind him all turned their heads towards Zhao Xu, but looked at him and didn't show any special behavior, so they turned their heads back, thinking that the other was just a zombie who loved something strange.

The corridor was not very high, so Zhao Xu crawled up the wall, passing horizontally, and directly felt the stench coming from below.

His feet were only a few inches away from the body of the flesh-eating demon, making it even harder for him to imagine that he had to squeeze through the surrounded by these flesh-eating demons, with his whole body covered in pus, and how he would feel.

"Ha ha, master, although you have received a 20-level blessing, the key attribute of climbing skills is strength, but you have only 8 points of strength and will receive a 1-level penalty, and in addition, the 'nausea' state caused by that demon. Master, your climbing skills are only 17 levels, and adding the difficulty of passing through the 25-level wall, it's a toss-up."

Rakshasa scolded, as if trying to save face.

"No, Rakshasa, you're wrong. I'm horizontal climbing now, not vertical climbing, so if I fail to climb, I'll just fall and hit the flesh-eating demons, and I can still climb again in a few seconds."

Zhao Xu said, which was the reason he preferred to use magic to enhance his climbing skills.

Rakshasa was immediately speechless, his face slapped.
Here is the translation:

However, Zhao Xū also just said that, if he really wants to go up and climb the ceiling, he really needs to use "spider-like" magic.

Suddenly, a cold breeze brushed past Zhao Xū's back, where he was arguing with Lux, and he quickly grabbed the wall again, holding on for dear life.

The shadow that had been blocking the room suddenly flew towards the corridor where Zhao Xū was standing.

Facing this situation, Zhao Xū's heart skipped a beat, but he quickly stuck to the wall and thought of various spells in his mind.

The three-ring spell of immortality? It could only control three creatures, and wasn't applicable in this case.
The two-ring "derivative vaccine"? He was already dead, and it was useless to become a derivative of the shadow.
The spell of returning to the afterlife? This spell could destroy the undead, but unfortunately, it was a six-ring spell, and Zhao Xū couldn't use it.

As Zhao Xū thought of various spells, he realized he was at a disadvantage, with only a three-ring spell, and no one-hit wonder spell.

So he decided on the spot to prepare to drop down and fall into the group of corpse-eating demons.

No matter what, it was better to be eaten by the corpse-eating demons than to be drained of life force by the shadows. However, the shadows' target was not Zhao Xū, and most of them flew past him and continued towards the front.

Only when the shadows flew past Zhao Xū's back did he feel a cold breeze and clench his teeth.

However, Zhao Xū's heart was more concerned about what lay ahead.

It wouldn't be the case that these undead creatures were being controlled by someone with intent, would it? If so, the difficulties he would face next would be too complex.
At this moment, a low and mournful melody began to echo through the corridor, slowly seeping into Zhao Xu's ears.

However, Zhao Xu was so startled that he almost fell to the ground, his whole body trembling.

Because in Arthur's world, this melody was the "Mourning Lament" sent to bid farewell to the dead.
