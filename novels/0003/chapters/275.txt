At that time, Zhao Xu's power after consuming potential points was equivalent to the performance of an additional 10th level warrior with just a casual sword.
And now, as long as he is willing to consume 1 potential point, he can save three spell slots.
"Master, there is a divine power here, I suggest you better sacrifice yourself a little." Lux continued to entice.
If he could become a god, even if it meant eating some kind of excrement, Arthur's team would be unstoppable.
Let alone just a spider.
But Zhao Xu was different.
"Lux, I am a man who has mastered all first to third level spells. If a mage only has one way to solve a problem, then the reason is that he knows too few spells," Zhao Xu said helplessly.
At this point, he directly approached the wall of the corridor, feeling the ruggedness of the wall and the length of this endless corridor.
"Master, are you thinking of using the first level divine spell 'Grounded'? Although this spell can improve your balance, climbing, jumping, and rolling skills by 10 levels," Lux said. 
"But even if there are some climbing or standing points on the surface of the wall, the difficulty of climbing exceeds 20 levels, not to mention that you cannot produce climbing or standing points on the spot with wall nails. Otherwise, those shadows are not fools, and zombies are not clever enough to use tools to climb walls," Lux slowly blocked the way of climbing.
And Zhao Xu was clear about all this. Without wall nails, simply climbing through the crevices of the wall made of bricks and stones would have a difficulty of at least 25 levels. With the "Grounded" spell providing 10 levels, and his climbing performance ranging from 1 to 20 levels, the probability of successfully climbing the wall was really not high.
However, it's also good that the wall surface is not completely smooth. Otherwise, his level of climbing skills would be useless, even if it's at the level of ten thousand steps.

"Lax, improving climbing skills is not just about one spell. Remember, the diversity of spells is what makes a mage powerful," Zhao Xu said.

"Who said that?" Lax was about to scratch her head.

Throughout the millennia, there have been similar meanings among mages, but the wording is somewhat different from this sentence.

"Oh, the mage Zhongxia," Zhao Xu joked.

Then he reached into the multiple pockets of his robe and took out a small capsule, crushing it directly. A drop of sap flowed into his palm, and Zhao Xu began to cast a spell—

The unique spell of the Forest Wanderer, "Lizard Wall Climbing."

[Adventurer Zhongxia, your climbing skill has been enhanced by 20 steps for a duration of 5 minutes (1 min/level).]

Suddenly, a large number of climbing actions appeared in Zhao Xu's mind, and his limbs seemed to be equipped with mechanical hands. If there was any mistake in his climbing posture, this force would immediately correct it for him.

In just an instant, after this spell was cast, Zhao Xu became a master of the "climbing" skill.

The initial enhancement of the "Lizard Wall Climbing" spell was only 10 steps, and it reached 20 steps at level 5, and 30 steps at level 9. At that point, even if there were only sporadic cracks on a wall with both feet hanging in the air, Zhao Xu could climb without hesitation.

With the support of the 20-step climbing skill, Zhao Xu directly hooked into the cracks in the wall and leaped into the air.
This scene made Lax see a little stunned, "Strange, when was the new spell of gecko wall climbing developed? Why didn't I just think of it?" 
But when Zhao Xu heard this, his eyebrows twitched, which meant that without transforming into the corresponding artifact, Lax might not be all-knowing in some aspects either. 
But slowly, Zhao Xu had no time to think about it. 
Just as he climbed up, the few shadows turned to look at Zhao Xu, but seeing that Zhao Xu did not have any other special actions, they turned back, thinking that the other party was just a fan of special zombies. 
The corridor was not very high, so when Zhao Xu climbed on the wall and went across, he directly felt the stench coming from below. 
His feet were just tens of centimeters away from the body of the ghoul below, which made it even harder for him to imagine how disgusted he would be if he really squeezed through these ghouls surrounded by his whole body robe covered in pus. 
"Hmph, master, although you have been blessed with the 20th level, the key attribute of climbing skill is strength, and your 8 points of strength will receive a 1st level penalty, plus the 'nausea' caused by the demon. Master, your climbing skill is only at 17th level at most, and with the 1-20th level performance, it's just between the two. " Lax said indignantly, as if trying to save face for himself. 
"No, Lax, you guessed wrong. At this time, I am horizontally climbing, not vertically climbing, so if I fail to climb, I will just fall down and collide with a few ghouls, and in a few seconds I can climb again." Zhao Xu said, this is the reason why he would rather use spells to enhance his climbing skills. 
Lax, who was immediately slapped in the face, fell silent.
