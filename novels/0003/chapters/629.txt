Chapter 630: Establishing a Territory, Territory Management

[Legacy Equipment: Paradise on Earth

Usage Requirements: 1. Basic Attack Level 5; 2. Non-Evil Faction; 3. Proficiency in Longsword; 4. Territory Owner

Initial Legacy Ritual: You must proclaim your combat philosophy to over 10,000 people, including martial artists and civilians with no foundation, within a certain range.
Cost: None.
Reward: Initial Legacy Expertise (Paradise on Earth)]

As Zhao Xu looked at the dynamic information on his own profile, he was also slightly astonished, wondering if his recent strategy on charging forward hadn't unconsciously fit the "combat philosophy" of the Initial Legacy Ritual of "Paradise on Earth".
In other words, more than 10,000 people had unknowingly listened to his speech.
However, Zhao Xu didn't have the slightest thought of regretting his strategy, mainly because he had said that others couldn't emulate him.
He was equivalent to providing the formula for a medicine, but the specific dosage and craftsmanship hadn't been disseminated.
At this point, the Initial Legacy Ritual for "Paradise on Earth" was completed, and Zhao Xu didn't bother with others' curiosity, immediately directing his gaze towards the specific abilities of the weapon.

Legacy weapons usually have different abilities from level 5 to 20. Sometimes, certain levels may lack abilities.
Upon completing the Initial Legacy Ritual, one can obtain the corresponding weapon's Initial Legacy Expertise and use abilities from levels 5 to 10.
Mid-level Legacy is from levels 11 to 16, and High-level Legacy is from levels 17 to 20.
Zhao Xu, who was at level 10, had just obtained all the abilities of the "Paradise on Earth" from levels 5 to 10.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he looked around, he immediately spotted something.

[Heavenly Realm
5th level: +1 Long Sword
6th level: Leadership Attack (First Layer White Swan)
7th level: +1 Unwavering Long Sword
8th level: None
9th level: Leadership Charge (Second Layer White Swan)
10th level: +1 Unwavering Flowing Sword (Flow: White Swan)]

The sword in his hand, which was once the Heavenly Realm, had already transformed into a +1 Unwavering White Swan Long Sword, equivalent to a +3 value magic weapon.

Moreover, this sword directly granted him two crucial skills of the White Swan Flow, "Leadership Attack" and "Leadership Charge".

At this moment, Zhao Xiu had already released the first-layer footsteps of the White Swan, "Leadership Charge", and the damage would increase when charging. When "Leadership Attack" (First Layer White Swan) was used, it would be accompanied by his triumphant cry, and his attack could inspire his comrades, ignite their fighting spirit, and ultimately complete a heroic feat.

As part of the skill, Zhao Xiu could make his comrades, when attacking the target he had struck, gain a 4-level morale bonus within a single round.

Regardless of whether it was the early or late stages, excluding mages, even paladins and druids, who are spellcasting professions, would still spend a significant amount of time in melee combat. Zhao Xiu was like a general, leading the charge and attacking with his comrades, and this skill would give them a remarkable boost in attack power.

Moreover, this skill did not have a limited range of effect. Once Zhao Xiu activated it, his retinue would be able to obtain the same effect when attacking a giant dragon.

However, the most crucial one is "Leadership Charge" (Second Layer White Swan).
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Lu led the charge and asked Zhao Xu to stand at the forefront, rushing towards the enemy lines, with his companions following his lead.

This tactic could allow Zhao Xu to disrupt the enemy formation, inspire his comrades, and ultimately avoid being counterattacked. Moreover, it would also deal an additional 10 points of damage.

As for the doubled attack bonus, 10 points was just the beginning.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had some doubts about the upper limit of his single-charge attack after adding these abilities.

Especially, the "Unwavering White Raven Long Sword" in his hand allowed him to choose other powerful spells to add to his "Enhanced Weapon" skill. He had saved a small amount of resources.

Moreover, he could prepare three techniques daily, and once they were used up, they would automatically recover quickly.

The two techniques not only allowed him to control them as if they were his own, but also came with five daily usage opportunities and did not conflict with the original technique preparation system.

As Zhao Xu looked at the scene in front of him, he felt a faint sense of illusion.

He began to think deeply about the true nature of the "Heavenly Paradise" weapon.

At the junior level, the requirements were to spread the principles of martial arts to all people, but as he reached the intermediate and advanced levels, he wondered how to proceed.

He did not want to make each person in the world a professional warrior, making the world think that "Heavenly Paradise" was a real place.

As he thought about this, Zhao Xu felt a headache coming on.

Legendary weapons, as their name suggested, were all historical weapons that had accumulated the power of time.

He did not know the history of the "Heavenly Paradise" and could not guess the details.

"After listening to the story, it's time to set out," Zhao Xu sighed and said, looking at his long sword.
Here is the translation:

Suddenly, his abilities allowed him to think that he should try out his current melee output right away, but unfortunately, the anti-magic zone he could only use at level 11.

"What's going on?" Some people were confused for a moment, as Zhong Xia had just meant to adjust and then take collective action.

"I suddenly realized that all the creatures in the cave and outside have heard our voices. This opportunity should not be wasted."

The mage, who was good at extracting juice from stones, nodded in agreement.

Zhao Xu's eyes gradually brightened. "So, we need to change our actions."

As he spoke, he stood up and turned to the dark void behind him, saying:

"I, Zhong Xia, temporary ruler of this cave, hereby announce to all the friends who have been listening to us that this cave has the following information..."

Slowly, as the sound of his words spread, the players who had been immersed in the secret of the cave all lifted their heads, looking puzzled.

As Zhao Xu's clear voice spread, most of the players' eyes also began to clear and brighten, slowly filling with the hope of life.

...After Zhao Xu's public announcement, the players in the mysterious cave bottom, including those who had just heard about the strategy from outside, suddenly understood the terrifying nature of the cave bottom.

Their top priority was no longer to explore the cave bottom but to escape alive.

Fortunately, Zhao Xu had obtained enough information and began to search for knowledge, which greatly expanded his scope.

Instantly, relying on his "intelligence" and the process of constantly transmitting information during the undead tidal wave in the barren wasteland, he knew the locations of numerous caves.

He also quickly analyzed the distribution of cave personnel in his mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he thought of it, he began to slowly reveal his thoughts, taking advantage of the rare "communication time" to arrange for the players in the underground cave to gather slowly in a certain direction according to his plan.

At the same time, Zhao Xu also promised to stand at the forefront and protect the players who entered the underground cave.

In the process, he also took the opportunity to promote the current personnel absorption policy of Yanan.

The information that Zhao Xu gradually revealed from his mouth was either big or small, and it was said that it was heard by the people above the cave.

The propaganda personnel sent out by the organization had difficulty communicating with the high-level leaders and could not spread the policy to the entire camp.

Zhao Xu even thought about distributing some of the treasures given by Anxi to the players as rewards to attract these listeners.

They were the best billboards.

Originally, the secret existed only at the high level, but after the number of people increased, it was impossible to block it, and slowly, the people who agreed with Yanan would rise to a new level.

For the people below, Zhao Xu's revelation of those confidential information was like "the sound of the wind and the moon" - a secret that was "as real as the sky".

This concerned the personal interests of all soldiers, and it could be said that whoever heard it owed him a favor.

From the perspective of the players, Zhao Xu's order was like a call to war, and people would rush to fulfill it, not to mention just gathering to hear the news.

Unconsciously, the players in the underground cave began to gather like a small stream, flowing towards the target location predicted by Zhongxia.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had made it clear.

After he successfully left the outside world, his focus might change.
Here's the translation:

Feeling the power transmission from the "Humanitarian Paradise", especially the prerequisite conditions of the Humanitarian Paradise, which is the ownership of the territory. He or she is also aware of it to some extent.

If he wants to quickly enhance his Nine Swords ability.

He should not wander around like an adventurer for a while from now on.

Instead, he should focus all his energy and start building the territory of Xiaoyun.

It's time for Zhao Xu's cultivation upgrade stream to give way to the chapter of agricultural upgrade.
