Chapter 252 - Face to Face

Hearing Zhao Xu's words, Frank, who had already become a nine-ring wizard, couldn't help but reveal a nervous expression. The devil had left a deep shadow over him.

Compared to the leaders of the abyss, the nine layers of hell had nine leaders, with Asmodeus as the main one. Meanwhile, the war between the abyss and the bottomless pit could last for many years.

On one hand, the leaders of the abyss were fighting each other, and on the other hand, it was evident that the bottomless pit itself had its own foundation.

Zhao Xu looked at Frank, the wizard, with a hint of mockery, and said directly, "Aren't you trying to get back your wife?"

"If you're afraid to face that devil, it's better to give up now."

Frank, who had transformed into a construct being, clenched his teeth and said, "Okay, I'll try."

As he spoke, he took out an ancient copper mirror from the dimensional bag, which was only the size of a palm. The mirror seemed to be a woman's makeup box.

However, the pattern on the back of the mirror was drawn in hellish language, and the mysterious emblem in the center emitted an ominous aura.

"When my wife's soul was swallowed by this mirror at first, I kept her body waiting for her return," Frank said with a melancholy tone.

For ordinary people, the cost of resurrection is the biggest problem of reviving the dead.

However, for powerful adventurers, the biggest problem of resurrection is the fate of souls.

Resurrection is impossible to coerce.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Frank then took out the necessary offerings for the summoning ritual from the dimensional bag and continued to hold the summoning ceremony. Next, he drew a simple magic circle on the ground to start the ritual.

"These demons are a bit cautious, and even the summoning ritual needs to be custom-made?" Arthur's summoning demons had many spells, but most of the time, he summoned ordinary-level demons. However, Zhao Xu, who had some experience with the ritual, felt that this ritual was different from the usual summoning ritual. It not only served as a means of communication but also had other purposes.

Some summoning rituals could terminate, but the attention of the evil beings from the other world did not cease. Those evil beings could even track the target being and obtain the contractor's sensory information, including their thoughts and feelings. Moreover, they could even send direct suggestions.

Frank noticed that his opponent did not take any defensive measures before summoning the demons, as if he were inviting friends rather than summoning demons.

"It seems that he has failed in his trial run. This time, he might have a change of heart, not even bothering to prepare any defensive measures," Lark said.

As Frank carefully set up the summoning ritual, Zhao Xu couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. "This shows that the demon is very cautious. Lark, are you sure?"

"Ah? Sure?" Lark suddenly asked, "Why do I need to be sure? After all, you have the 'Fiery Servant of Heaven' amulet on your body. The angel won't let anything happen to you."

"Lark, we're facing a 'Hell Lord' level opponent, even if this time it's just an incarnation," Zhao Xu said with a slightly furrowed brow.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Heh heh, Master, you know it's a transformation, right? We're in the material plane, born to suppress them. But I estimate it won't come, just a simple communication."

At this moment, Frank also completed his setup, began to chant the incantation for communication, and constantly turned the mirror in his hand.

Suddenly, the temperature in the treasure room dropped a few degrees.

Slowly, Zhao Xu felt a powerful mental energy suddenly descend upon the mirror under the influence of true knowledge and various detective skills.

It was as if some kind of "interdimensional binding" spell was being used to control extraterrestrial beings. It seemed that the other party had been summoned.

Now, with just one will, Zhao Xu could only "talk" at most.

Suddenly, a malevolent force burst out from the mirror, as if carrying the stench of blood and death, enveloping the entire treasure room.

["Adventurer Zha Xia, you are currently within the influence range of the 'Evil Spirit'."]

The eight-ring spell "Evil Spirit" was naturally known to Zhao Xu.

However, he didn't expect that just completing the ritual would cause the other party's will to descend, resulting in such a spell outcome.

It already had the implications of a war on a massive scale.

"Ah, which lowly worm is this?"

Suddenly, a blurry figure appeared in the mirror, speaking in a hoarse voice in hellish language.

With the blessing of "Cunning" on him, Zhao Xu quickly reacted to the other party's words.

"The breath is indeed at the level of the lord, and Frank is also capable of stirring up trouble." At this moment, Lark also said.

"It's me, the lowly Frank." Frank hastily bowed his head towards the blurry voice in the mirror.
Here's the translation of the text:

"Oh, it's you, Frank, have you met the three conditions I set? If you don't, I'll put your wife's soul into the body of the demonic being, and from then on she'll become one of us."

The wicked devil sneered.

"No, no, please don't do that, great 'Erik', master," Frank cried out in despair.

Even though his blood had merged with the secret silver, and his body organs had been fully transformed, that intense emotional feeling had not been extinguished within him.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xu took a step forward, his expression solemn as he gazed at the mirror with the devil's intent.

"You're a priest of the Magic Goddess, and a disgusting aura surrounds you. Were you forcing Frank to do something? Should I, for example, have him kill you all?" The vague shadow of the devil laughed mockingly at Zhao Xu.

But after hearing that his wife's soul would be injected into the demonic being's body, Frank was already in a state of panic, having lost his basic thinking ability as a wizard.

"Hand over Frank's wife's soul," Zhao Xu said, looking at the hazy figure in the copper mirror.

At this moment, he was holding the "Miracle Art" ready to unleash its power.

With the remaining half of his life energy, he had originally intended to save it for the big battle tomorrow or the day after.

If he encountered such a situation, he would not hesitate to use it.

"Haha, who are you? What kind of face is this, and how dare you exchange pleasantries with me, great one?" The devil in the mirror was even more arrogant.

"This character doesn't seem to match the rulers of the nine layers of the underworld," Lark said in surprise.

Compared to the countless rulers of the underworld, the rulers of the nine layers were all recorded in history.

"One representative of Frank comes to negotiate," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're so confident, how about we make a bet?" the mirror's will suddenly taunted, "If you're willing to bet your soul, I can also bet the soul of Frank's wife."

"How do we bet?" Zhao Xu asked.

By this time, the "miracle technique" on his hand was almost ready to go off.

"For example, try to guess who I am. You have three chances. If you guess correctly, I'll return Frank's wife's soul to you. But if you don't guess correctly, I'll take away your soul."

The mirror's blurry figure continued to entice Zhao Xu.

He wasn't afraid of Zhao Xu's tricks, as long as he could navigate through his linguistic traps. Once Zhao Xu started guessing, the consequences would be like making a vow in front of the River of the Afterlife.

"This sounds like a one-third possibility of guessing," Lark said, thinking, "Three chances to guess the current nine rulers of the Underworld, which seems not too difficult. However, in reality, the Underworld actually has some former rulers, even demonic entities approaching the level of rulers, but they have not been granted territories to rule."

"Okay?" The entire treasure library suddenly echoed with the mirror's evil will's cruel laughter, "You're looking for a weak helper, hahaha."

"I accept," Zhao Xu said.

Frank's eyes, which had already lost all hope, suddenly revealed a look of incredulity.

"Then you can start guessing. Just three names, okay?" the mirror's power said.

However, unlike traditional demonic contracts, it did not present a complex agreement for Zhao Xu to sign.

"Miracle technique: I want the contract to be executed without any loopholes."

"Miracle technique: I want the contract to be executed without being interpreted."

"Miracle technique: I want the contract to be executed fairly and impartially."

"Miracle technique: I want the contract to be executed perfectly and without damage."

"Miracle technique: I want the contract to be executed immediately."
Here is the translation:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu exhaled a mouthful of air and consecutively performed five miracles, one after another.

A sacred aura burst forth from Zhao Xu's body, and with each syllable, the pressure of the willpower in the void grew stronger.

Innumerable divine powers suddenly filled the space, constructing an inescapable cage that slowly locked down the space, bit by bit.

It was as if every step he took would collide with the forces of the rules.

Under the influence of the miracles, the originally implicit oath began to manifest, swirling above everyone's heads, filled with the meaning of the future.

Zhao Xu and the shadow in the mirror exchanged words, each one glowing with golden light, transforming into an unbreakable covenant.

"What kind of outrageous use of miracles is this?" the mirror's will suddenly felt a surge of anger.

It didn't expect that the trap it had set would actually become a self-binding oath!

"However, you haven't guessed it yet. You must swear to execute it immediately, and you've also sealed off your own path," the mirror's will responded with a sinister smile.

Even if Zhao Xu had guessed it, he could still delay for hundreds of years or even directly give the other party a demon attached to the soul of Frank's wife.

At the request of Zhao Xu's miracles, their oath was immediately actualized, and the pressure on him also grew significantly.

"Gratzet."
Zhao Xu suddenly spoke the name of the most powerful and few who could challenge the evil king of the abyss, Gratzet.
