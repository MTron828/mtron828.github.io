Chapter 554: Celestial Rain, Crossing Begins

"Have you dropped out?"
"Yes, I didn't even participate in the final exams and used a medical leave excuse to take a year off."
"Don't tell me, I heard that the other party's parents even came to the school to handle the procedures themselves."
"I'm going crazy, it's made such a big fuss."
"Not to mention, he had been addicted to the game Arthur for a year and didn't attend classes, and when the game was shut down, his mental state collapsed."
"This will definitely become a teaching example for educational guidance next year."
"You guys should just study well, what's the gossip about?"

As Zhang Qi was taking notes in the study room, he couldn't help but stand up in annoyance when he heard these idle chatter.

"Don't be like that, Zhang Qi," Feng Ge quickly pulled Zhang Qi back, fearing a conflict.

After the crowd fell silent, Zhang Qi sat back down with a scowl on his face, continuing to copy the key points drawn by Feng Ge.

At the same time, he glanced out the window, his mind wandering.

Zhao Xu, where are you now, that little rascal?

As Arthur shut down, the entire game forum quickly went dark.

The once-famous IDs "East City Rui", "Summer", "King Qing Wei" slowly faded into the depths of players' memories.

Only a few game-related threads remained, occasionally popping up to ask where those people had gone.

And East City Rui, the account that triggered a massive storm, became a laughing matter as the calm after that night's storm passed.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, after the entire team of Arthur refunded and the game was shut down, this incident occupied the headlines, and the whole wave was not able to reach its peak before being extinguished in the middle.

The spark that ignited the storm was Zhao Xu, who was quietly sitting on the high-speed train, gazing out the window at the rural scenery passing by, with the recent events swirling in his mind.

Zhao Xu didn't care too much about not crossing over this time.

However, he suddenly felt a sense of unease, wondering if something abnormal had happened on the Arthur side.

Especially his mentor, An Ti Nuo Ya, had been alone in the Bathos Abyss for a whole four months. Before that, they would occasionally catch a glimpse of each other's returning figures every 10-20 days.

But then, An Ti Nuo Ya didn't appear for a whole month. By now, the material energy channel hadn't opened as expected, and Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder if An Ti Nuo Ya had something wrong, so the Floating City was in disarray, and this incident was delayed.

Or, it could be that the Earth humans, who were excluded from the plan at the last minute, could only silently wait for the universe to perish in a few years.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a strong sense of determination, wanting to see the vast rivers and mountains of this world.

After discussing with his parents, he took a year-long sick leave.

"Aren't you also a player of Arthur?" the girl sitting next to him exclaimed, noticing the notebook on the foldable table with the Word page open.

Inside was his own hand-drawn replica of the "Malicious Transformation Technique" content.

"Wow, you used to be a mage, right? Definitely a high-level player, I've never seen a mage as powerful as you among my classmates," the girl exclaimed, carrying her luggage.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu gazed at the other person for an instant and immediately judged that it was a student who had just taken the national college entrance examination and was on a graduation trip. He just smiled silently and didn't make any further responses. There was no crossing over. However, Zhao Xu's memory remained intact, relying on the abilities of the wise heart practitioner who had once possessed the power to remember all the spells from zero to five rings. Therefore, during this period, he would tidy up the content of the spells and consolidate them whenever he had free time.

"Aiya, Arthur has over a dozen formed languages, and he said it's true. I was the first to agree, but I didn't expect that in the end it was just an illusion." The girl sighed, recalling her past experiences.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu's smile contained a hint of bitterness. He turned his head to gaze out the window. The destination city was gradually approaching.

It was a hot summer day. Wearing a pair of shorts and a three-leaf clover T-shirt, Zhao Xu had just stepped off the platform when he saw a girl who looked like she had stepped out of a painting, her features refined and beautiful. The girl suddenly jumped up and waved her hands at him.

"Qingwei?"
Zhao Xu was taken aback for a moment before recognizing this woman who had undergone a radical transformation since crossing over.

"Come, Zhao Xu," King Qingwei smiled brightly, beckoning Zhao Xu with a happy expression.

As Zhao Xu naturally pushed his luggage cart along the way, he suddenly discovered that there was another girl he was extremely familiar with standing behind King Qingwei, waiting to help him with his luggage.

"Zhao Xu, no, it should be Mr. Zhongxia, long time no see," Zheng Xin Yu said, puckering her lips at Zhao Xu.

"What? You've met before?" King Qingwei asked in surprise, her face pale and red.

"Haha," Zhao Xu chuckled, slapping his forehead and pretending to forget.
Here is the translation:

It was clear that Zheng Xin'an had already recognized Zhao Xu as the man who had given her an activation code during the concert. "Let's get on the car," Wang Qingwei said.

She and Zheng Xin'an had already attracted a lot of curious glances and had even received a few offers to chat from passersby. There were also drivers asking if they wanted to take a taxi. Zhao Xu didn't say a word and followed the two of them to the temporary parking lot.

As Wang Qingwei opened the car door, Zhao Xu couldn't help but say, "It seems that Lolita and the rich are connected."

"Hmph, I'm not a Lolita. You're almost mistaken about this term," Wang Qingwei replied with a snort.

As Zhao Xu had already put his luggage down and sat in the co-pilot seat, Wang Qingwei started the car and drove out of the parking lot.

"How long do you plan to stay in the city to unwind, Zhongxia?" Wang Qingwei asked.

"As long as I've taken a year off, I'll go wherever I want," Zhao Xu replied.

"Come on, Zhongxia!" Zheng Xin'an said from the back seat.

"Just kidding, I'm not that weak," Zhao Xu laughed.

Just as he said that, he looked back at Zheng Xin'an and Wang Qingwei, "You're just keeping your encouragement to yourself, which is a bit insincere, isn't it?"

"Hmph, who knew you were like this? You want a pillow or a hug, but it's not possible," Zheng Xin'an said with a hint of annoyance, "Qingwei, hurry up and get him out of the car, I was just about to encourage him to be brave."

"You're an idiot, Xin'an, look, the topic has been shifted by him," Wang Qingwei said with a smile, immediately noticing Zhao Xu's intention to shift the topic.

The three of them then started to joke and laugh around.
When they returned to the city center, Wang Qingwei booked a nearby hotel for Zhao Xu and allowed him to bring his son, allowing them to visit popular tourist attractions in the city. "Zhao Xu, there are too many children on summer vacation at Disney, and it's also a weekend for parents to rest. I won't take you there today, let's wait until the crowd thins out," Wang Qingwei apologized.

After a day of playing, the three of them sat down at an outdoor bar, with a table already set with multiple servings of barbecue. A bucket of ice was placed beside the beer, but in front of Zheng Xinan was a glass of fruit juice. The sound of a female singer singing folk songs could be heard from the floor below, occasionally interrupted by applause.

"It's not really something I'm interested in," Zhao Xu said, only to receive a glance of slight hostility from the two women. "Well, I still want to go, just want to thank you for giving me a new experience," Zhao Xu said.

Immediately, Wang Qingwei and Zheng Xinan laughed and began discussing what to wear the next day.

"I'm just going to hang out and eat and drink, how about you also come to Qingwei's place?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.

"I was also invited by Qingwei to visit her when you said you wanted to come," Zheng Xinan said proudly, "but I didn't take the high-speed rail, I took a plane, so I arrived quickly."

"Ah, the high-speed rail ticket is not cheaper than the plane ticket, I just want to see the scenery along the way," Zhao Xu said.

"I'm flying first class," Zheng Xinan concluded the conversation between the two.

As soon as the sound fell silent, the three people looked at each other in silence.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because the three of them had experienced Arthur's extraordinary power, they were clear about Arthur's true existence and were convinced that the "travelers" would cross over.

"What's going on?"

Zhou Xu silently put the blanched Chinese cabbage into his mouth, "The meteors didn't fall that night, and I've been thinking about it ever since. It's all a blur in my mind."

"Ah, I'm the same," Zheng Xin also rubbed his head thoughtfully, "I almost got scolded to death by my dad afterwards. However, they later thought that I was under too much pressure from the college entrance examination, so they didn't say much."

"What about you, Qiao Ning?" Zhou Xu asked curiously, also using his mental illness as an excuse to escape, and couldn't help but wonder Qiao Ning's strategy.

"I? My mom just pays attention to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, as well as her investment strategies, and doesn't care about what I say."

"Just so."

As Qiao Ning also revealed a bitter smile, "Zhong Xia, is it really the end of the game?"

At this moment, Zhou Xu also wanted to comfort the other party, but he couldn't help but notice that he couldn't open his mouth.

Lies had no meaning between them.

Zhou Xu looked up, gazing at the sky that was similar to the one a month ago, "I'm helpless."

"However, I heard a saying before."

"What is it?"

"The gods are not in July."

"It's cloudy and unclear," Zheng Xin commented.

But the one who had truly touched the divine power was lost in thought, lowering her head.

"Could it be that because the divine power disappeared throughout July, nothing is sensed, and naturally, the crossing over also disappeared?"

As Qiao Ning spoke, Zhou Xu, who was sitting beside him, was like a fog clearing.

He had previously thought that Arthur's spirit would descend to the mortal world at some point, but no longer exist in the divine realm.
Here is the translation:

"However, it turned out that it was not because of the reason for crossing over that was delayed. Zheng Xin Yu also clapped her hands and said, "Today is the last day of July, isn't it?" After hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but lift his head up, gazing at the sky above, where he could barely make out the Big Dipper and a few scattered stars. But he didn't lower his head again. Instead, he saw the countless meteors, one after another, trailing long tails as they streaked across the sky, leaving a golden trajectory that slashed through this piece of the celestial expanse."
