Chapter 209: Foreboding Luck

As Zhao Xu saw this scene, he didn't feel nervous at all. Having experienced the underground labyrinth, he knew that when encountering problems, he should immediately search for various clues.

Zhao Xu immediately turned around and ran back, and indeed, the entrance he had originally come from, which had initially had no obstacles, was now sealed off. He could still see the outside sunlight, which had been consumed by the darkness.

Zhao Xu took a step back, following the path he had taken when he came, and began to climb the stairs again.

The pit had been covered in darkness magic when he first entered, extinguishing the constant flame he had created using 50 gold coins and the second-level spell "Unquenchable Flame". In order to escape the environment shrouded by this darkness magic, the flame could only be restored to its brightness.

Zhao Xu could only rely on the first-level spell "Uruk's Eye" to see through the darkness magic. Ordinary priests would only have the ability to see in the dark environment with the second-level spell "Dark Vision", but would not be able to see through the darkness magic.

In some cases, low-level spells may not be weaker than high-level spells. Until Zhao Xu reached the highest level of the stairs, he discovered that the entrance he had just entered, which had been sealed off in silence.

On the stone door, an inscription was carved: "Only those with a steadfast will, who have passed the test, can chant the incantation to open the distant path."

Under the sentence was a password written in dragon language. Zhao Xu did not rashly recite the incantation. What test?
Here is the translation:

Among the three types of exemptions in Arthur, they respectively represent physical strength, mental determination, and agility. Zhào Xù's mental exemption bonus is 6 levels, with 4 levels coming from his profession and 2 levels coming from his perception adjustment value.

This 6-level bonus, combined with his actual performance level, is the final result of the exemption check. The system will quantify his performance level in the exemption check as a 1-20 level evaluation.

So, his basic bonus (6 levels) combined with his performance (1-20 levels), as long as it exceeds the difficulty level of the exemption, he can pass the check.

This means that for mental exemptions below the 5th level, he is guaranteed to pass, unless the system evaluates his performance as a "1-level" failure.

For mental exemptions above the 26th level, even with excellent performance, he is likely to fail, unless his performance evaluation is perfectly 20 levels, in which case there is a glimmer of hope.

However, in Arthur, a performance level of 1 or 20 does not necessarily mean guaranteed success or failure, as there are deeper mystical implications involved.

At this moment, Zhào Xù looked at the sentence and actually understood the meaning.

When he chanted the incantation, he would receive an attack on his mental strength.

If he failed in the subsequent exemption check, he would naturally retreat.

If he succeeded, the vanished path would appear before him.

After understanding this, Zhào Xù couldn't help but sigh.

Fortunately, he is a dual-mastery adept.

As a mage, he has low reflexes, low physical strength, and high mental strength, just like his current 1-level reflex exemption bonus, which is vastly different from his 4-level mental exemption bonus from his profession.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu's own two-point perception adjustment brings a two-tier reward. He is currently one of the top players in Arthur, with the highest willpower among them. Many control spells, such as the "Mass Immobilization" spell, would essentially rely on willpower to resist. For example, the "Decree: Intimidation" spell does not require willpower to immobilize.

Zhou Xu's current challenge is that his willpower fluctuates when he makes a judgment. Some skills, such as "Climbing", can provide a stable "10-tier" evaluation, and even with perseverance, the system may give a "20-tier" evaluation. However, Zhou Xu's willpower and his mental state, including whether he got a good night's sleep, even whether he was hit with adrenaline, all have a significant impact.

Therefore, the "1-20 tier" result of his performance is uncontrollable. However, the permanent willpower bonus added to his base stats can be temporarily increased.

Zhou Xu once used spells to stack his knowledge skills to an unimaginable extent in the Mystic Forest.

At this moment, the hidden mage noticed that the cave had been sealed by a stone door, and realized that the player who had gone down to the trial had reached the dead end of the trial. The entire trial officially opened.

He shook his head, "If he finds out, no matter how many willpower bonuses he stacks, the difficulty will naturally increase by five levels. That is, he will always have only a 75% chance of passing, and will he feel hopeless?"

Note: I translated the text in Simplified Chinese as per your request.
Here is the translation of the text:

The farmer pulled out a long bamboo smoking pipe from his pocket, gently placing it on his lips, and deeply inhaled, letting out a cough.

"This is also to show that, ultimately, the stacking of single-digit numbers will encounter the existence of no mitigation. At that time, he may have realized the subtlety of fate, which would be beneficial for him to learn the spells that can change his luck and various manifestations later on."

"Changing luck is not easy, and those nine-ring wizards, how many haven't mastered them? Even the top-level nine-ring divine spell 'Selecting Fate' chosen by the priestess of the domain of 'Destiny' has few who can do it," the wizard retorted, not showing any confidence in the opponent's ability to do so.

"Who knows?" the farmer replied, leaning slightly to one side, allowing himself to lounge comfortably on the couch.

However, his eyes still exuded a hint of envy.

When it comes to attacks, skills, attributes, and mitigation, all four can be performed twice, with the better result taken as the final result of the nine-ring divine spell, making many nine-ring wizards drool.

Mastering this spell would mean that one would not be played by fate again.

At this time, only separated by a wall, Zhao Xu, who was unaware of the outside discussion, was thinking about how to increase his 6th-level mitigation value to ensure a stable pass this time.

The simplest way would be to cast the two-ring spell "Cunning Insight" once, which could temporarily increase his Perception attribute by 4 points and add a 2-level bonus to his mitigation. This spell lasts for one minute per caster level, and for him, it would last for about five or six minutes, which would be long enough for the short-term.
Before Zhao Xu took action, he still thoroughly searched the stone door, trying to discover more clues. Possessing the "instinctive action" technique, he was not afraid of suddenly encountering any problems, as he could always create a 7-meter distance. Suddenly, Zhao Xu's finger stretched to the gap between the stone door and the doorframe.

After feeling around, he discovered that there was an intricate carving of hollow characters there. With his knowledge of the common language of Arthur, he naturally pieced together the characters one by one and formed a sentence - "Things do not exceed five."

Zhao Xu abruptly pulled his hand back and fixed his gaze on the stone door, which emitted a mysterious aura. This sentence was a characteristic of the half-plane.

Therefore, the number of people allowed was strictly limited to no more than five. This also meant that the difficulty of the current order was always above his intention by five levels. Clearly, he had not stacked up any meaning.

However, as long as he could perform above five levels, he could pass through smoothly. Zhao Xu was clear that the performance of adventurers was divided into 1-20 levels according to the large data plan. For example, if he performed 100 times, the worst 5 times would be ranked as 1 level, and the next 5 times would be ranked as 2 levels, with the strongest 5 times ranked as 20 levels.

Therefore, the performance value of 1-20 levels was uniformly distributed. This meant that Zhao Xu would maintain the same state and recite the incantation 20 times, with around 5 failures.

From a large data perspective, his pass rate was only 75%. If two people came here, they would both fall into the 25% failure probability range, with a rate of around 6% each.

Only Zhao Xu, who came alone, would be restricted.
Here is the translation of the text:

Of course, in the end, he is also capable of issuing a 5-20 grade evaluation. Therefore, most failures come here, then retreat and don't dare to complain.

After all, it's not a game of dice where they bet their lives. It's a true display of themselves.

At this moment, Zhao Xu is facing this scene and can only sigh softly.

Alas, he has mastered the second-level spell "Premonition of Good Fortune" and doesn't need to struggle to show off.

This spell can only let him choose once.

But that's enough.

Zhao Xu immediately takes out a 20-gold coin dice made of gold, throws it onto the stairs, and begins to chant an incantation with his mouth.

Suddenly, the golden dice transforms into a weak golden glow, then disappears.

Immediately, the power of fate directly affects Zhao Xu's body, and his eyes emit a faint golden light.

Zhao Xu then turns around, reciting the "password" in front of the stone door.

Then he sees two golden silhouettes appearing in front of him.

Respectively, they imitate the intentions of his future selves!

Next, he sees one future self with a "performance evaluation" of failure at a grade of 3.
And another future self with a "performance evaluation" of success at a grade of 10, exceeding the upper limit.

Zhao Xu immediately concentrates his mind, and the two silhouettes instantly disappear. However, the success silhouette chosen by Zhao Xu is fed back to him, and he acts accordingly.

[The adventurer Zhongxia performs a willpower check, with a result of 6 (fixed) + 10 (current performance) = 16, exceeding the difficulty of 11, and passes the check.]

At this moment, a loud "Boom" sound also comes from behind Zhao Xu.
As he looked back, the originally dark road ahead began to slowly emerge with a door that didn't exist before, with a glimpse of bright light inside. The road, has returned.
