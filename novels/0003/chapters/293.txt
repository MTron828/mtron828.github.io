Chapter 294 The Essence of a Mage
Mage Tower?
Zhao Xu almost didn't react when he heard it.
Looking at the group of thirty or forty players in front of him, all of them were fully armed, and they could be considered an elite team among players.
It can be said that this time the "Watchers" guild has basically sent out all its elite members.
However, even so, when it comes to facing the Mage Tower, these players basically only have the option of being defeated.
The minimum requirement for designing a Mage Tower is the "Arcane Geometry" specialization that can only be mastered by at least a level 9 mage, but most mages who want to build their own Mage Tower will entrust the design of this project to professionals.
In Zhao Xu's backpack, there is also a "Guide to Building a Mage Tower" that he borrowed from the legendary library, which lists all the construction costs and required conditions for a Mage Tower.
Mainly, building a Mage Tower itself is a long-term project. In addition to considering the transportation of materials to the construction site, a large number of workers with corresponding skills must be hired.
At the same time, the various functional and special rooms of the Mage Tower are also costly to build.
If you choose to build in a city where materials are easily obtained, even a 15m x 15m plot of land will cost thousands of gold coins. After that, additional fees for various taxes and inspections will also amount to hundreds of gold coins, which is the least amount spent throughout the entire construction process.
For example, a workshop, even if built in the wilderness, costs 8000 gold coins each, while a sealing room and a blasting room must be built with a budget of 1500 gold coins per square meter, with a small 10 square meter room starting at 15,000 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

If it's luxurious, the cost of the folding space is 500 gold coins per square meter, just like the folding spaces seen by Zhao Xu, which are all tens or even hundreds of square meters. But if it's just for a few dozen square meters of folding space, that's completely a waste of money.

And if we add the extra cost of the flying package that allows the wizard tower to fly freely in the air, that's an additional 250,000 gold coins.

So, basically, only ten-level or higher wizards would consider building a wizard tower.

Only they could afford it.

Therefore, Zhao Xu saw a group of players at the highest level of one or two levels wanting to explore this wizard tower, which is a bit strange.

It's as if Zhao Xu's confusion was understood, and as the "Frost Sword" smiled and explained, "The wizard tower fell from the sky to the bottom of the sea during a great war. At the time, the wizard's family was afraid of causing trouble, so they only drew a simple map and passed it down."

"Who would have thought that a hundred years later, the wizard's descendant would want to retrieve the treasures inside the wizard tower, but accidentally leaked the information, and ultimately the map fell into our hands."

Zhao Xu's brow furrowed even more.

However, he was not concerned about the story's twists and turns, but rather that it was a wizard tower built in the air.

The cost of building such a wizard tower is four times that of a normal wizard tower, and it's clear that the owner of the wizard tower is extremely wealthy.

But Zhao Xu didn't expect that the other party's descendants had been patient for a hundred years, only to suffer the consequences.

Looking at the Frost Sword's intentions, it seems that they are only thinking of looting the treasures inside the wizard tower.

It's estimated that the wizard tower will be handed over to themselves in the end, since players can't move it anyway.

Zhao Xu finally understood why the other party required a 5-level wizard.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just then, he could barely muster the strength to perform the "Water Breathing" technique, allowing him to lead everyone to dive into the water and explore the tower inside.

Moreover, the existence of the wizard tower was reported by the wizard association, and he could gain more benefits than the players.

The higher-level wizards were also afraid to join, fearing that the opponent would directly kick them out and monopolize all the wealth inside the tower.

As for the 5th-level wizards, they were just at the level where they could still hold their own against 40 players.

The news about the wizard tower was enough to stir the hearts of wizards at this level, even just looking at the tower itself.

In the current situation where players were mostly at level 3, designating a 5th-level wizard would not only avoid the risk of player leakage but also eliminate the risk of leakage.

However, the opponent did not expect that the 5th-level wizard, who was equipped with over 10 magical accessories, was actually a player.

As everyone thought that the 5th-level wizard "Star Shadow" was still in the Northern Alliance, he had already returned to Mistralth in secret.

It's likely that the opponent had thought carefully before proposing such subtle level requirements.

Zhou Xu also smiled, saying that even pigs would know better after being tricked by the native players for two months.

Arthur's adventurers were actually in a competitive relationship with players.

"What's the specific task reward distribution?" Zhou Xu asked directly.

Several players sitting beside the "Frost Sword" looked at the well-equipped wizard and asked about the reward, with some of them showing joy, knowing that the opponent had accepted.

Each additional person who knew about the task represented an additional risk.

They dared not invite higher-level wizards, fearing that the opponent would open his mouth wide like a lion.
"Afterwards, the whereabouts of the Mage Tower itself and the ownership of the tower belong to you, Mage 'Feng'. The rewards from the 'Mage Tower' belong to us, but you, Mage 'Feng', can choose one item first." At this time, the woman next to Frost Sword spoke, her expression cold, and she looked guardedly at Zhao Xu.

She is "Snowfall," the sister of Frost Sword.

Upon hearing this reward, Zhao Xu nodded, completely accepting it. After all, the other party had already paid a large sum of money in advance to the "Association."

The reward could be obtained whether the mission was successful or not, which was also the reason why major organizations were so indecisive in seeking help from the Mage Association.

"I accept, but there are a few things I need to mention first," Zhao Xu said. At this point, he looked at the thirty or forty subordinates sitting behind Frost Sword in the corner of the post station, and frowned slightly. "My third-level Mage spell, 'Underwater Breathing,' can last for 2 hours at each level, for a total of 10 hours. The duration will be evenly distributed among all those who come into contact with it."

Zhao Xu's words were very clear - with just one spell, he could only provide 10 hours of underwater breathing, which, when divided among 40 people, would only be 15 minutes each. They wouldn't be able to stay submerged for long before needing to come up for air.

Arthur didn't have oxygen tanks for diving, so if living beings wanted to dive deep underwater, they would have to rely on the third-level spell "Underwater Breathing" or transform into underwater creatures. They also needed to prepare a "Aenstone" that allowed them to breathe without needing air.

As for Zhao Xu, he had the "Ritual" and an Aenstone, and as a seventh-level spellcaster, he could last for 14 hours. He wouldn't easily reveal this to the other party.
Who knew that Frost Sword would smile and say, "You don't need to worry about the Wind Mage. The descendant of the previous mage has been preparing two 'Water Breathing' scrolls for many years in order to explore the Mage Tower. And we have also bought two from the market, so altogether we have four scrolls, a total of 40 hours."

"At the same time, some of my teammates behind me will be guarding the shore and escorting us to transport the supplies. The ones actually going underwater are these few level 2 teammates by my side," Frost Sword said.

Zhao Xu nodded at this, thinking that even if 40 hours were divided among 10 people, each person would have 4 hours, which would be enough for basic exploration.

The Water Breathing spell itself is a core spell, so its scrolls can still be purchased on the market, especially in Mysteria, the magical capital. In other cities, Frost Sword probably wouldn't be able to buy a level 3 spell scroll for 375 gold coins within two or three days.

"So when the time comes, I'll have to ask the Wind Mage to use these spell scrolls," Frost Sword requested.

Upon hearing the request, Zhao Xu agreed. As a third-tier mage, he could cast any arcane scrolls of third-tier or lower as if he were casting his own spells.

If a wanderer wanted to simulate using spell scrolls by relying on the "Use Magic Device" skill, they would not only have to simulate an intelligence of 13 and meet the casting prerequisites, but also simulate being a level 5 mage, making the simulation difficulty a total of 25 steps. Currently, there are not many wanderers who can achieve this.

If they fail, they would waste 375 gold coins and could potentially suffer serious consequences such as backlash damage, random target effects, or even some strange effects like blowing bubbles out of their mouth.

Therefore, it was safest for Zhao Xu to use the scrolls. However, he still asked a disruptive question, "Are you prepared to die once?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Initially, Zhao Xu thought he was just going to negotiate a price increase, but the management of the "Guardian" union did not expect it to be such a big issue.

"Not to mention a single Revival Stone, even if we add up the Revival Stones of all the people present, it's worth it," Frost Sword said, looking at Zhao Xu's eyes with a flash of light.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, determined.

He was afraid that if he gave up, he would not be able to recover. Even if he was a 5th-level mage, he would have to use the Revival Stone to test the traps set by the mage tower, or else it would be too easy. The opponent had brought more than 30 people, and it was likely that they had prepared for this.

"Now, shall we set off?" Zhao Xu asked.

"As long as Mr. Wind Fury is willing, we can set off now," Frost Sword said with a smile.

"Let's set off then," Zhao Xu said, with no hesitation, fearing that prolonging the journey would lead to changes.

The fact that the mage descendant was being kidnapped meant that someone outside had already discovered it.

At this time, Frost Sword politely walked over, saying, "Mr. Wind Fury, the road ahead is long, so we've rented a horse-drawn carriage from the relay station. Although it's a bit simple, it's the best we can do for Mr. Mage."

Zhao Xu noticed a relay station worker leading a horse-drawn carriage outside.

He smiled slightly and said, "No need, let the ladies in your team sit down."

"No, Mr. Wind Fury, this journey is not short, and you'd better conserve your energy," said Chen Nuo, a 2nd-level mage who was rarely seen in Floating City, standing in the corner.

"Yes, no need, mages travel using magic," Zhao Xu said lightly, declining the offer.
He then began to chant the spell directly, taking a full 6 seconds to use his expertise in "Mysterious Foreseeing" to cast the three-circle spell "Charming Shadow Horse".

A semi-real, semi-fake "creature" with the shape of a horse appeared in front of everyone. Its four hooves were made of non-physical smoke, and its black horse head was very spirited. Its gray mane was also very soft, and it had accessories such as a saddle, bridle, and reins.

"The three-circle Charming Shadow Horse!" exclaimed the mage Chen Nuo, who had just helped Zhao Xu conserve energy.

The guild members, who had initially thought it was just a regular first-level "summon mount" spell, were curious about the mount Zhao Xu had summoned. But now, upon hearing Chen Nuo's explanation as the ultimate authority on guild spells, they couldn't help but be surprised.

Is this really necessary? Isn't a 5th-level mage only allowed one or two three-circle spell slots?

But Chen Nuo didn't care about that anymore. He remembered the details of this spell and said with trembling lips, "It's impossible, the casting time for this spell is 10 minutes."

"Agreement one: Do not question the abilities of hired mages," Zhao Xu replied with a smile, mounting the horse directly.
