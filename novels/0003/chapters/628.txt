Chapter 629: Junior Transmission of Ancient Times, Warfare Spreads Across the Land

"As for specialized skills and magical abilities, there are also 'Tiger's Frenzy' that can be used. This sacred warrior's one-ring godly technique can double the damage of the first strike after charging forward."

"Next is the White Raven style in the Nine Swords system, which has a lot of fixed cumulative damage. Of course, the Tiger Claw style is also good for adding damage to jumping and chopping."

"Saint Warriors also have a variant ability, which is the Sacrificial Mount ability that can be exchanged for the 'Charging Forward' ability. This ability can be used to deal 2 times the Saint Warrior's damage during the charging phase, and it can also add to the multiplier of the charging damage."

At this moment, Zhao Xiu's words were brief and concise, having already led the crowd in the direction of brushing cards.

His thoughts were also clear, initially using the stacking force method, and now using the fixed damage method.

Instantly, the images of 1st-level Barbarian, 1st-level Saint Warrior, and X-level Warrior emerged before everyone's eyes.

However, no one expected that it could be played in such a way.

After a while, someone raised their hand to ask: "But the Barbarian requires non-lawful good, while the Saint Warrior is 'lawful good', which is completely contradictory."

"Not," Zhao Xiu shook his head, "there are still differences."

Looking at the data in his mind, he also finally understood.

The demon Saint Warrior who had previously followed Ernest, was actually a chaotic good Saint Warrior. Ernest himself was chaotic good, but his alignment was 2 levels different from the Saint Warrior's. Therefore, that demon Saint Warrior was actually a chaotic good variant Saint Warrior.

"A Saint Warrior actually has a type of freedom Saint Warrior," Zhao Xiu said. "This type of Saint Warrior's alignment is 'chaotic good'."

As if struck by the mighty bell of the Yellow Bell, the words deeply resonated within the hearts of the crowd. At this moment, Zhao Xiu did not stop, continuing to say, "After specializing in one's abilities, it is the category of magical items."

"If you have the ability to forge magical weapons in the future."

Or, like me, using "Enhance Weapon" magic to directly add magical properties to the weapon, Zhao Xiu thought to himself.

"Then I can recommend a few magical enhancements."

Just as he said that, a sudden gust of wind blew through the cave, whipping up the crowd and causing some to shiver with a sense of unease. They couldn't help but wrap themselves in their robes and armor.

"Unwavering, +1 value, one of the strongest magical enhancements that increases the basic damage of a charge by a factor of two. Unfortunately, this technique is not well-known in the Eastern Domain."

"Counter-Strike, +1 value, dealing 2-12 (2d6) damage to the enemy and 1-6 (1d6) damage to oneself when hit. Its advantage is that it is a standard magical enhancement that is easily obtained."

"Explosive Strike, +2 bonus, increasing fixed damage by 5 points. However, since the charge damage is doubled, it is stronger than floating damage. It can easily add tens of points of damage."

"Style, +1 bonus, corresponding to the style of the flow, combining with the Nine Swords' stance and technique to greatly increase one's attack ability. However, it is a secret transmitted by the Eastern Empire and is difficult to obtain."

"Of course, as a warrior, the best way to counter an opponent is to activate the 'Anti-Magic Field' at any time, which allows you to level the playing field and counterattack. Therefore, it's best to rely on abilities that are not affected by the Anti-Magic Field, such as 'profession' and 'specialization'."

As Zhao Xu was explaining this, he suddenly paused.

Flashbacks of Anzuelo's explanation of the Anti-Magic Field flashed through his mind. "The Anti-Magic Field" can also be a powerful defense at times.

He didn't know why, but the thought kept popping up in his mind, pouring into his brain like a mad rush.

For a mage, casting the Anti-Magic Field can be said to be a ruthless and decisive means of defeating an enemy. Clerics also have some melee output abilities, and those who take the holy knight path will use this ability to decide the outcome of the battle.

Of course, if a mage loses all their magical abilities, they are no match for a cleric.

As for Zhao Xu's planned career path, he had considered the "Guardian" ability, which allows you to specify a type of creature that is not affected by magic. And at level 12, you can learn the specialization "Unusual Magic Aim", which allows you to create a region where a creature is not affected by magic effects.

Zhao Xu had thought of using "Unusual Magic Aim" to activate the Anti-Magic Field, which would make the area around him a vacuum. However, such a consequence could also cause someone to cast a fireball spell into the Anti-Magic Field, resulting in the area around him being affected.

However, Zhao Xu now has the possibility of using the "Iron Heart" ability, which could allow him to reduce the range of his own Anti-Magic Field. In the end, Zhao Xu could activate an Anti-Magic Field that does not affect himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

On his body, there were dozens of terrifying spells, making him a half-god who could roam the earth. If he could get close to a legendary mage, it wouldn't be difficult to take him down. Even if the opponent used the "Mage Disintegration Technique" first, the probability of being hit would be only 1% per level. Even Anzhi Narja, who had eliminated 70-80% of the effect, had not reached 100% elimination. Ordinary mages who had not leveled up would have a 20-30% chance. Therefore, people would still rely on magical countermeasures, creating distance, and setting up barriers to counter the Mage Disintegration Technique.

In an instant, as soon as Zhao Xu grasped the "Iron Heart Power", he gained the possibility of killing the top-tier strong opponent Arthur, and the battle would no longer be one-sided. At this moment, he could be considered the first sword of Arthur.

This sudden realization made Zhao Xu aware of a slight difference from his soul. He only mentioned names and directions, but it was extremely difficult to achieve what he wanted. He couldn't help but look up at the dark cave above, where there was no color, just a chaotic mess, like his current mental state.

"Hmm!" Suddenly, the black heavy sword behind Zhao Xu let out a faint hum, as if a phoenix was soaring into the sky.

"What's going on?" someone asked.

The audience sitting around Zhao Xu, who had almost kowtowed in worship, suddenly exclaimed in shock, thinking that an attack had come. This also made all the players outside the cave, who had been listening like they were in a trance, suddenly wake up and wonder if something unusual had happened below.

"Jade Sword Technique?" The young warrior who had read too many fantasy novels let out a loud cry.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu's "Heavenly Abode" behind him vanished, he suddenly rose from the ground, quickly flying away and disappearing without a trace. It seemed like I hadn't used the activation spell?

No, I don't even know this six-ring technique.

Zhao Xu's mind flashed with countless thoughts.

He didn't understand why, after explaining the strongest components of the charging system to the dozen people in front of him, this ancient weapon would behave so strangely.

However, the next moment, the heavy sword suddenly struck the hard cave ceiling, and sparks flew out, as if the sword's material was made of fire-iron.

"What? Has it evolved into a divine tool?"

"What's happening? Is it self-crafted?"

At that moment, everyone saw that Zhao Xu's original heavy sword, which had been constantly striking the hard cave ceiling, was slowly shedding iron fragments.

As the sword continued to be hammered and heated, it slowly became thinner.

"Whoa!" It suddenly returned to Zhao Xu's eyes, hovering in mid-air, rotating continuously.

Zhao Xu silently extended his hand and tightly gripped the "Heavenly Abode", which had undergone a transformation.

Until it stopped spinning.

It had turned into a "long sword".

The "Heavenly Abode" had suddenly transformed from a typical "Iron Heart Flow" sword to a "White Raven Flow" long sword.

As the crowd gazed in shock, Zhao Xu tightly gripped the long sword in his hand, with an expression that was hard to believe.

At that moment, a declaration echoed in his mind:

"Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have preached the martial arts of the Heavenly Abode to the masses, completing the 'Initial Ancient Ritual' of the Heavenly Abode —— martial arts of the Heavenly Abode."
