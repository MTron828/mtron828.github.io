Chapter 533: The Pale Justice

As soon as he heard these words, even though Zhao Xu's heart was as calm as a still lake, he was still taken aback.

Not dead?

How did the Itrean Empire come to an end? And how did the "Lost Legacy" stir the hearts of countless power-seekers?

Just thinking about the underground organization leader Kuroze and the six sisters' treasure trove filled Zhao Xu's heart with a sense of abundance.

Although he already knew the true nature of the Lost Legacy, it was actually a "fake treasury" set up by Ernest in his previous life.

The treasury was later inherited by the "driver" who inherited the surname of Anzilina, namely the old man Matthew, who founded the Itrean Empire.

The treasury also returned to Anzilina's hands, and he even used the alias "older sister" to deceive the treasury and select the "Stellar Cloak" he wore on his body now.

However, no matter how Zhao Xu imagined it, he found it hard to understand how the legendary founder of the Itrean Empire, known for his wisdom and bravery, could have a connection with the old man Matthews before him.

Zhao Xu turned around and looked at Anzilina, whose skin was still somewhat immature, with the fine, silky hair on her cheeks still not shed. He then glanced at the half-buried old man Matthew.

He couldn't help but wonder if Ernest had been biased in the past.

Why did Ernest only give Anzilina the "Timeless Indifference" and not grant the same to his own adopted son, the driver?

Zhao Xu's mind was already filled with various spells.
Here is the translation:

"It's all thanks to the 'Ultimate Breath' spell, a Druid's four-ring divine magic, that he can now replace his old body with a youthful one, without losing his level, physical condition, and other attributes.

When the time comes, he can use the 'Wish' spell to resolve the issue of random species.

'Isn't it strange?'"

The old man, Maistus, smiled humbly, his eyes deep and profound, as if he had fully understood Zhao Xun's thoughts.

As he looked at the real Maistus, who had truly existed in history, even appearing as the protagonist in many legendary novels, Zhao Xun slightly crossed his legs and stood up straighter.

Facing the elder, he showed the respect due to his age.

"No," Zhao Xun said.

"Actually, this is also a curse," Maistus joked.

"Curse?"

"No, it's not," Maistus said. "During the reign of Emperor Ernest, he surveyed the entire world for a thousand years, forcing the gods to surrender their authority, even unable to take a single step beyond the divine hall."

Maistus' eyes seemed to sink into memories, his eyes overflowing with a mixture of sadness and nostalgia.

"So, after Emperor Ernest disappeared, the gods made a pact, and Death itself granted power to all future rulers, cursing them to inevitably decline and perish."

Maistus coughed, covering his mouth, and continued, "Therefore, I lost the ability of eternal life, regardless of whether I replaced my body or used 'Eternal Stasis' to fake my own death. I could not delay my physical and spiritual aging."

"My worn-out body, the only thing I can rely on, is to use legendary magic to constantly delay the day of my death. Naturally, physical aging cannot be delayed."

Maistus' expression remained calm, without a hint of sadness.

"Why is it so stern?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu had a hard time imagining it. But he soon reacted, even if it was the Elven race with a lifespan of over a hundred years, the monarch's reign would not exceed a hundred years. Even the emperors who were born as wizards were very rare. The legendary wizard named "Ying Er Gou" from Dongtu, who Zhou Xu had encountered before, might still be the great-grandson of the current emperor of Dongtu. It turned out that all of this was due to the curse.

As Zhou Xu looked confused, the old man continued to explain, "Perhaps you cannot imagine that before Ernest descended upon this land. In that dark age of cannibalism, people would strip the skin to make a painting on the temple wall, cut off the skull to make a sacred ritual utensil, and take the leg bone to make a ritual staff. These barbaric behaviors were completely normal back then."

"One careless word of blasphemy could lead to the entire village being wiped out and everyone being slaughtered." "Those who do not believe in the gods will be slaughtered at will."

As the old man finished speaking, he fell silent. "When I was born, I was originally supposed to fulfill my father's oath to the gods and sacrifice my own flesh and blood to the gods." However, just as I was about to be abandoned, a witch sensed that my mother was still pregnant with another child. In the end, my twin brother took my place and I survived.

"It was the master who put an end to that era of chaos and brutality, and limited the bloody side of divine power. He made the gods conform to their own divine nature, no longer chaotic and demonic. This was the true wealth he left for Arthur."

Zhou Xu fell silent.
Even a legendary mage like Arthur might not be able to achieve such a peaceful and calm state. Matthias knew the existence of this "curse" and still decided to embark on creating an empire, and even Anita lent him a fake library. It's understandable that the waves of the past reached a critical moment like this.

Zhao Xu nodded silently in respect towards the old man who had once protected this land. The old man's face suddenly lit up with a smile, waving his hand, "Don't worry, after all, the will he left behind was for me to guard Miss well until the true dawn arrives and remain in a dormant state."

As he spoke, he carefully observed Zhao Xu, Anita's student, with a smile that couldn't be concealed.

"Well done, you've broken through to the fourth ring in such a short time. It's likely that you'll reach the fifth ring soon." The old man, Matthias, sighed, "After becoming the essence of the world's net, your breakthrough speed is rare, even among players."

"Thanks," Zhao Xu said modestly.

He's used so many "cheat" resources, it's not fair to compare with others.

"However, I hope you can persuade Miss for me," the old man, Matthias, suddenly changed the topic.

"What?" Zhao Xu was surprised.

But he didn't know the context beforehand and wouldn't express too many opinions.

"Hmm."
Just then, Anita turned her back to them, her hand waving indifferently, facing them, "The Nine Hells, I'll go myself."

"Miss."
At this time, old Master Matthias exclaimed urgently, "When the master left, he said that he had left behind a hand of great power at the bottom of the infinite abyss, which would allow you to roam freely within it."

"But that Asmodius, the nine-layered overlord, is an existence that is difficult for you and me to estimate. Even the master of old kept a distance from him, who is ageless."

Zhao Xu was also astonished as he looked at Anisinoia, who had never thought that Anisinoia had once joked with him several times about going to the abyss and hell to fight, and now he was actually doing it.

"Teacher, is there something I need to get from the hell?" Zhao Xu asked.

However, Anisinoia did not directly answer this time, "There are some things I even suspect that you all knew from the beginning, but hid from me."

"As such, I will have to investigate personally. And since the nine-layered hell is so vast, I may not necessarily encounter the overlord of hell immediately."

Although Anisinoia showed confidence in the face of the lords of the abyss, he revealed a hint of gravity when mentioning the overlord of the nine-layered hell.

This reminded Zhao Xu of something.

He had once encountered the legendary "Glazt" in a confined space, who was rescued by the goddess Sylvia after being saved by her.

At that time, the other party also warned him to be cautious of the overlord of hell, which was not the same as the "Glazt" he had just encountered, one of the top three lords of the abyss.

"Miss, you've said that before, you took the 'Cyan Justice' from the library," old Master Matthias sighed, "If you're not going to fight him once, why do you need to use a sword that can break through conceptual defense?"

Conceptual defense.

This was the first time Zhao Xu had heard of this term since leaving the floating city.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's as if his "Stellar Cloak" combined with "Reflection Immunity" has already approached the concept of "immunity" to physical damage. It's like a demon, having "magical immunity" and can ignore all spells that require "overcoming magical resistance". Piling up numbers until the opponent can't break through, ultimately, there's no direct ignoring that's as strong.

Immunity is the strongest defense.

At this moment, Zhao Xu can't help but worriedly look at Anzhi Niyao. Unbeknownst to Zhao Xu, Anzhi Niyao is shaking her head in annoyance, "You're really a talkative burrow. I should have made it a urinal from the start."

Zhao Xu only then realized that the treasure chest he entered earlier judged whether he was a descendant or a legendary burrow!

Looking at the troubled expression of the old man, Mathus, and the determined will of Anzhi Niyao.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask, "Teacher, what do you want to ask? If Mr. Mathus knows, wouldn't it be better to not ask?"

"Hmph." At this moment, Anzhi Niyao spoke coldly, "I just want to know if my birth was designed or not."

"So I need to ask that soul that has become a devil."
