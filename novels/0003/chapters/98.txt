Chapter 099 Canyon
The next morning, before the whole team set off again, Roy deliberately came to talk to a few players.
Through the method of passing messages offline by the players last night, Roy had already given feedback to the leader Is and made some inquiries about the adventure process.
After receiving instructions, Roy expressed Is's deep apologies to them, and the previously promised compensation will be executed. As for Zhao Xu, he will choose to compensate him with a magical item.
It is estimated that Is also guessed that Zhao Xu was using a staff based on Roy's description, so he simply compensated him with a magical item of unknown value.
Zhao Xu had no objections to this, the only trouble was that Roy was probably not going to let him use that expensive staff in the future.
The entire smuggling caravan began to move forward again.
Sitting on the carriage, Yu Yu looked at their rear and whispered, "Is that the power of magic?"
The poet frog, upon hearing this, also looked over. Where his gaze fell, the mine they had entered had disappeared without a trace, as if it had been erased from the map.
"I hope one day I can do the same," the poet couldn't help but mutter to himself, but he knew very well that as someone who had chosen the path of a wandering poet, he was unlikely to reach that level.
Thinking of this, he couldn't help but have a moment of self-doubt, wondering if he should delete his account and start over.
Although Zhao Xu's own spells were average, the magical spells of the mage Laien deeply shocked everyone during their underground dungeon experience.
Here is the translation of the text:

"However, I wonder what kind of spell Liren used to forcibly move us. This spell is too tyrannical. If there was a trap nearby, wouldn't we all be dragged into it and killed? The Wanderer Rainbow complained.

At that time, he had just given the signal to Zhao Xu and conveyed the information about the safe arrival, and was then taken away by Liren.

The others, who had seen his illusion, also voiced their safety arrival and were then taken away.

As for Luo Ya, he was taken away when he was just panting and his spirit was relaxed after reaching the end point.

Throughout the process, everything was set up against Zhao Xu, and Luo Ya had dropped his dagger, and the illusion had also dropped a dagger.

Even Luo Ya was initially very excited and was directly eliminated, which was to prevent him from revealing too much to Zhao Xu.

"That spell should be 'Dimensional Teleportation', which can forcibly move people. You probably didn't pass the will exemption, so you were taken away. If you had passed, you would be able to see the exemption information on the character card panel." Zhao Xu explained.

Liren's spell was beyond Zhao Xu's level, and it was normal for them not to be able to pass.

"Xia's summer. This time, we owe it to you. How about you join us on our adventures in the future?" Maple Leaf invited Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "I'll have to go to Mistral to complete my task after this, and I won't be able to join you on your adventures."

The others knew that Zhao Xu still had something to deliver in Mistral and didn't expect to have more tasks.

"Hey, it's okay, we'll see each other again in Mistral," Yu Yu smiled calmly."
"Does that mean we will be able to see the floating city again? I have heard of the mysterious building in Nandu from the Tianbei Business Alliance. Zhongxia, do you know what it looks like?" Rainbow interjected.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh, "You'll know when you get there."

The floating city of Mysteriousra has a main and auxiliary structure, and Zhao Xu has only stayed in the main floating city.

But his attention shifted to Maple, recalling the instructions of Mage Laien.
At that time, Yoyo called out the name of Dimogagen, and Zhao Xu didn't take it seriously at the time.
He was very clear that these demon lords like Dimogagen were powerful because they were in the abyssal planes, they were the sons of the planes, and even the gods might not be able to match them.
Once they come to the main world of Arthur, there are records of them being killed.
He vaguely inferred this from Antinoya's tone.
However, he also didn't expect that Dimogagen would actually pay attention to Maple, partly due to that curse.
But he couldn't openly say to Maple, "Maple, to avoid being harassed by demons, please die and be done with it."
He dared to say this, but I'm afraid everyone in the carriage would think he's a fool.
Zhao Xu pondered for a moment and asked in a low voice, "Maple, how many resurrection stones do you have left?"

Any player who established a warrior account at the start of the server, as long as they can survive for a year without using up all their resurrection stones, will have at least reached level 4 or 5, and can be considered a big shot in the player community. Most warrior players like Zhao Xu have heard of their names.
And he indeed had no impression of the name Maple, perhaps in his previous life, this warrior character Maple did not survive until the end.
At this point, Maple raised his head and asked in surprise, "What's wrong? I've already used up all my resurrection stones."
As soon as he finished speaking, everyone in the carriage showed embarrassed expressions.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't expect the result to be like this. The mortality rate of warriors at the initial stage of the server was too high. However, he quickly reacted and realized that the wizard was dead, and he had to go back and re-record the spell unless he could retrieve the spellbook inheritance.

Warriors could only graduate from the professional training grounds by picking up their weapons and leaving the scene, as they had already learned. This was also the reason why warriors were weak in the later stages of the game, and players were numerous and endless.

Some guilds even promoted the "Warrior Sea Tactics", which was to recruit 15-point warriors, complete the first-level training on the same day, and then fight to death using up five resurrection stones. The next day, register a new warrior account and repeat the process five times.

The only cost was to recover the armor and weapons from the corpses.

However, after receiving this response, Zhao Xu didn't worry too much.

According to their adventurous style, the probability of Maple Leaf staying alive until next year was similar to the probability of Di Mo Guang returning to the main material plane.

As long as Zhao Xu didn't change his faith again, he would have a way to contact Maple Leaf.

Just then, a horseman poked his head in and said, "Ladies and gentlemen of adventurers, this is the gorge ahead, and this section is the most dangerous part of the road. Would you like to get off and walk?"

"Okay, we'll get off," Maple Leaf nodded in agreement.

They were indeed passive as they hid in the car, waiting for the ambush.

Not long after, Zhao Xu and the others got off the car, and then they were invited by Luo Ya to go ahead and march together, effectively canceling their surveillance mission.
"Zack, let Mr. Zhongxia ride your warhorse," Roya ordered, ignoring Maple and Rainbow, who were looking on eagerly.

After the power of riding and charging spread on the forum, many warrior players were eager to try it, but a warhorse was too expensive. It was so expensive that it caused the warriors to sell their equipment and still couldn't afford a warhorse for fighting.

"No need," Zhao Xu directly refused. He never accepted the exploitation of others for his own enjoyment.

Zhao Xu indulged himself, using his unique foresight expertise to cast the "Summon Mount" spell, consuming a blank first-level spell slot on the spot.

"Truly magical arcane arts," after gaining experience, Roya had become a qualified straight man and timely praised.

Zhao Xu was too lazy to listen to his boasting, and directly mounted the summoned "light horse," although it was not suitable for combat, it was enough to pass through the narrow canyon ahead.

After this incident, Rainbow occasionally came over to pat Zhao Xu's summoned horse.

"Be careful, everyone, raise your guard," the whole team had arrived at the canyon, and after Roya's shout, he sent a few wanderers ahead to scout.

For their underground forces, the wanderers were still quite effective.

"No, someone's there!" The wanderers hadn't even reached the canyon before shouting and blowing the whistle in their mouths.

At this point, heads popped up from behind the boulder piles on the slope of the canyon, obviously deliberately lying in wait to intercept their team. Seeing that they didn't enter the canyon directly, they simply revealed themselves.

"Enemy attack, set up defense," Roya shouted and directed his subordinates to start defending.

Maple and the others also quickly gripped their weapons, preparing to fight.
Zhao Xuzhe smiled happily, damn it, finally a match for their level of adventure. He had enough of being treated like a grandson before.
