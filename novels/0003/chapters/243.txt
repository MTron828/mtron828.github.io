Chapter 244: Divine Transformation

As the light of the heavenly kingdom illuminated the scene, Saint Warrior Et immediately felt a surge of powerful positive energy coursing through his body.

"Is this a healing technique?" he asked with a hint of suspicion.

This unyielding saint warrior had devoted himself to the church for many years and had never experienced the treatment of the six-ring divine technique.

Robin, the highest-level priest present, also clearly felt the holy light spread by the divine power, filled with the familiar intent and strength of the goddess.

Even he, who had not suffered significant damage, received the "healing technique" with a single 150 HP boost.

At this point, he turned around and saw that everyone in the scene had an incredulous expression, as they too felt the same treatment as Robin.

The upgraded version of the six-ring healing technique, the nine-ring group healing technique, was something Robin knew about.

But group resurrection?

He had already had an unbelievable suspicion.

"What's going on? I was waiting for the countdown to resurrection in the creation temple!"

"Ah, and it's so strange... my status is full!"

"Is it you, Pastor Robin, who revived us?"

The players who had been revived instantly let out a collective gasp of surprise, and many gazed at Robin with a mixture of reverence and admiration.

This extra resurrection technique was, for players who had only five revival stones, almost like an extension of their in-game life.

Many veteran players had never dared to waste their revival stones carelessly, even if they had reached a high level.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Many players who had died early in the game and had received a revive stone would directly re-create their characters and try to complete the five revive stones to level 2. Meanwhile, the players who had been revived looked at each other in shock, staring at the priest "Feng" who had given them hundreds of gold coins and fireflies yesterday, slowly realizing that the one who had revived them was not who they thought it was. However, no one spoke up. Finally, after the Saint Knight stood up again, Priest Robin slowly turned around and asked the revived players, "Do you have any injuries?" The result was a chorus of shaking heads. At this moment, Zhang Qi looked at his girlfriend who was laughing and crying, wondering, "What's going on? It's like you just woke up!" Priest Feng laughed and said, "It's because you were revived by the Crown Prince." Hearing this, Zhang Qi almost couldn't catch his breath, knowing that the Crown Prince was a divine being. The Pope was the highest priest of the Church and managed the divine power in Arthur's domain. The third type of elect was basically a legendary strong player. Their will was also the will of the divine. Or, these elect were the strongest forces in the Church, having witnessed the replacement of several Popes. "Don't you have any injuries?" Feng asked, concerned. Zhang Qi shook his head. At this time, the players revived around him also knew that the situation seemed unusual. Meanwhile, Robin stood respectfully, waiting for the priest "Feng" to speak.
Here is the translation:

Zhang Qi couldn't help but ask, "What's going on? Is this resurrection not right?" 

Feng Ge, who was born into a priestly family, explained after organizing his thoughts. "The 'Five Rings' resurrection requires a 5,000-golden-diamond material as a resurrection material. Even if you pay the price, you will lose 1 level due to the painful experience of resurrection. But you, with only 1 level, will lose 2 levels."

At this time, the players around him finally realized that they couldn't enjoy the resurrection benefits as 1-level players. They usually used resurrection stones instead.

Zhang Qi was already shocked and quickly asked Feng Ge again. "If that's the case, then you must be the man who has resurrected with the 7-ring resurrection technique."

However, Feng Ge shook her head, her expression complex. "The 7-ring resurrection technique requires a 10,000-golden-diamond material, but it only limits the resurrection restrictions. Even if the body is not complete, it can still work, but it will still lose vitality."

At this point, Zhang Qi and the surrounding players couldn't imagine it anymore.

The priest Feng Ge nodded and said, "That's right, only the 9-ring resurrection technique, the 'Complete Resurrection Technique', can resurrect without losing vitality."

Zhang Qi felt his heart racing when he heard this. "It's too extravagant, I wouldn't be able to afford the 25,000-golden-diamond material even if I sold everything."

Just then, the Lord's words echoed in everyone's ears: "I want to resurrect all of you."
As soon as the sound of the words faded away, the players who had just been revived were suddenly silenced, their faces solemn and dignified. The four characters in each person's heart resonated.

As the holy light of that day slowly disappeared, everyone in the scene was completely revived, and their states were restored to their peak condition. Even if they had their own negative states, such as property damage, they were all restored to normal under the effect of the "Healing Technique" of the sixth ring.

When Zhao Xu said, "You've done a good job," Saint Warrior Aite and Priest Robin felt a surge of excitement, as if they were about to cry. Although the big shot in front of them had never answered their questions before, they felt a sense of immense pride in this moment.

"Keep going, I'll go after the remaining clues," Zhao Xu said, and his entire figure slowly disappeared without a trace.

Everyone in the scene maintained a solemn atmosphere, not daring to make a noise to disturb the other side. It wasn't until the last remnants of the spell had disappeared that the players in the scene took a deep breath.

"That person's words were too terrifying. It was as if there was an invisible pressure," someone said.

"Hey, how did he revive us?" someone asked.

"Isn't it the Complete Revival Technique?" someone else asked.

"Isn't it the Legendary Technique of our group now?" someone else added.

At this point, the revived players couldn't help but ask each other.

However, the sound was immediately interrupted because they noticed that the very respectful Priest Robin had turned around to look at them. Those who had received Robin's healing technique today knew that Robin was the real powerhouse of the team.
Here is the translation:

The crowd fell silent, waiting for his words.

"That's the 'miracle technique' of the Nine Rings."

Robbin thought for a moment before speaking, choosing each word carefully.

"Impossible?"

At this point, several players who were eager to speak out burst into excited shouts.

However, Robbin shook his head, saying, "It's not just a miracle technique within the ordinary range of effects."

"But rather, it's a true miracle, one that is prayed to and sought from the gods to block disasters. When I was a child, our small town was devastated by a flood, and countless people were displaced. At that time, the Pope was still a cardinal, and when he passed through our town, he performed this technique, directly restoring our town to its original state. That's why I joined the goddess's church and became a priest."

As Robbin spoke, he became lost in the memories of the past, but finally, he continued, saying, "And such an unlimited miracle technique is also known as a 'divine miracle'."

The players who had been revived by the Nine Rings' "Complete Revival Technique" were already deeply shaken.

Only after hearing Robbin's explanation did they realize that the technique was originally intended to communicate with divine power, and they had actually been revived by the goddess Cybil herself, imbuing them with divine power.

For example, a regular "miracle technique" might be simulated like a fixed system query function. But Robbin's actions were like direct assistance from customer service!

It's no wonder that they were a group of "Complete Revival Techniques".

"But, Your Majesty, there was no begging," Crue said, sensing something was off, and asked this question.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, everyone in the scene couldn't help but let out a deep sigh. "What does it mean?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but shake his girlfriend Feng Ge's hand, looking a bit confused. "Even if it's the Pope, it's still necessary to beg." At that moment, Feng Ge, the pastor, also felt a slight acidity in his teeth. "Mom——" Zhang Qi hesitated to say the last word, but he also finally understood.

It turns out that it's a divine transformation!
