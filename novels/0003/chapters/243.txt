Chapter 244: Divine Transformation

As the light of the heavens shone upon him, Saint Warrior Ette felt a surge of immense holy energy coursing through his body.

"What's going on? Is this some kind of healing magic?" he asked with a hint of skepticism.

This unyielding Saint Warrior had dedicated years to the church, but had never experienced the blessings of the six-ring divine art.

Robin, the highest-ranking priest in attendance, was also clearly aware of the sacred light being bestowed upon them, filled with the familiar intent and power of the goddess.

Even he, who had suffered relatively little damage, received a single "healing" buff of 150 HP.

At this moment, he turned around, and all present looked at him in disbelief, as they too felt the same treatment.

The upgraded version of the six-ring healing art, the nine-ring group healing art, was something Robin was familiar with.

But what about group revival?

He had already formed a doubt he couldn't believe.

"What's going on with me? I was just waiting for the countdown to revive in the Creation Temple, wasn't I?"

"Yes, and it's so strange... my status is full!"

"Is it really you, Pastor Robin, who revived us?"

The players who had been revived in an instant all let out a cry of surprise, and many gazed at Robin with reverent eyes.

An additional revival spell, which was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those who had only five revival stones, was even a prolongation of their in-game life.

Many players who had reached the late stages of the game dared not to recklessly spend their revival stones, as even one stone was precious.
Here is the translation of the text:

As many players who had died early in the game started to re-register their characters, trying to complete the level 2 quest with the remaining 2 resurrection stones. Meanwhile, the players who had been revived looked at each other in shock, staring at the priest "Feng" who had given them hundreds of gold coins and a fire sword yesterday, slowly realizing who had revived them.

However, no one spoke up at that moment.

After the paladin Saint Warrior stood up again, Priest Robin slowly turned around and asked the revived players, "Do you have any physical damage?"

The response was a chorus of shaking heads.

At this time, Zhang Qi looked at his girlfriend, who was crying and laughing, and asked in surprise, "What's going on? It's like you just woke up?"

The priestess Feng laughed and said, "It's because the crown below revived you."

When Zhang Qi heard this, he almost couldn't catch his breath, knowing that the crown below was referring to three types of existence. The avatar of the divine, the highest priest of the church, was one of them. The third type was basically a legendary warrior.

Their will was also the will of the divine. In other words, these elect were the strongest warriors in the church, and some of them had witnessed the transfer of power among several pontiffs.

"Have you suffered no physical damage?" Feng asked again.

Zhang Qi shook his head in response.

At this time, the players who had been revived around him also realized that something was off.

Priest Robin, who had received the response, stood up with reverence, waiting for the priest "Feng" to speak.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Qi couldn't help but ask, "What's going on? This resurrection is off?"

Feng Ge explained, "The 'Five-Ring Resurrection' requires a diamond worth 5,000 gold coins as a resurrection material. Even if you pay that much, you'll still lose 1 level due to the painful experience of resurrection. As a level 1, you'll actually lose 2 levels."

The players around him were shocked and started to murmur. They usually used resurrection stones, but hearing Feng Ge, a priest, explain this made them realize the truth.

Zhang Qi was stunned and quickly asked Feng Ge, "Is that so? If so, I've actually resurrected with a seven-ring resurrection technique before."

Feng Ge shook her head and said, "The seven-ring resurrection technique requires 10,000 gold coins' worth of diamonds. It's not just a matter of resurrection, but also comes with the risk of losing levels. Even if the corpse is incomplete, it can still work, but you'll still lose levels."

The players around him couldn't imagine what was going on.

Feng Ge nodded and said, "That's right. Only the nine-ring resurrection technique, 'Complete Resurrection', can resurrect without losing levels."

Zhang Qi felt his heart racing when he heard this. "Too luxurious! I wouldn't be able to afford 25,000 gold coins' worth of diamonds even if I sold everything I own."

Just then, Liu Qi added, "It's just that the Lord below said he wanted to resurrect all of us."
As soon as the words fell silent, the players who had just revived, still excited and chattering away, suddenly fell silent as if petrified. The words "言出法随" echoed in everyone's heart.

Finally, after the sacred light of the day nation gradually disappeared, everyone in the scene was completely revived, and their states were restored to their peak condition. Even those with negative status effects, such as attribute damage, were restored to normal by the "Treatment" spell.

"Good job," Zhao Xun said, looking at everyone. Saint Warrior Aite and Priest Robin, who had heard these words, felt a surge of excitement and tears of joy. Although this great person had never responded to their questions before, in this moment, they all felt an unparalleled sense of honor.

"Keep going, I'll go after the remaining clues," Zhao Xun said. Then, his entire figure slowly disappeared into thin air.

As the atmosphere remained solemn, no one dared to make a loud noise to disturb the opponent. It wasn't until the last faint glow of the spell had disappeared that the players finally took a deep breath.

"That guy's words are too scary. It's like there's an intangible pressure," someone said.

"What did that guy do to revive us?" someone else asked.

"Isn't that a fully restored spell?" another player asked.

At this point, the revived players couldn't help but ask each other. However, their voices were soon silenced because they noticed that the very respectful Priest Robin had turned back to look at them.

The players who had received Robin's healing spell today all knew that Robin was the true backbone of the team.
Here is the translation:

For a moment, everyone fell silent, waiting for his speech.

"That's the 'miracle technique' of the Nine Rings."

Robin thought carefully and then spoke sentence by sentence, trying to be as precise as possible.

"Impossible?"

At this point, several players who were quick to speak couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

However, Robin just shook his head, saying, "It's not that kind of 'miracle technique' within the ordinary range."

"But rather, it's a true 'miracle' that involves praying to the gods and seeking divine intervention to prevent disasters. When I was a child, my hometown was flooded and many people were displaced. The Pope at the time, who happened to be passing through the town, used this technique to restore the town to its original state. That's why I joined the Church and became a priest."

As Robin spoke, he became lost in thought, but eventually finished his sentence:

"This kind of limitless miracle technique is also known as 'divine miracle'."

The players who knew they had been revived by the Nine Rings' "Full Revival Technique" were already deeply shaken.

It wasn't until they heard Robin's explanation that they realized the technique was only meant to channel divine power, and that they were actually revived by the goddess Sylviana herself.

For example, the "miracle technique" that simulates a fixed system query function is like contacting customer service. The priest's actions just now were like direct customer service!

No wonder it was the "Full Revival Technique".

"But, Your Highness, didn't you pray?"

At this point, Cui Lu noticed something was off and asked about this detail.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, everyone in the scene couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.

"What does it mean?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but shake his girlfriend Feng Ge's hand, looking a bit dazed.

"Even the Pope has to beg," said Pastor Feng Ge, feeling his teeth slightly acidic.

"M---" Zhang Qi was about to say the last "egg" character, but he didn't dare to speak out, only to realize that it was actually a divine incarnation...
