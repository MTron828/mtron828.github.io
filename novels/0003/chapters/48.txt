Chapter 049 Domain

Day after day, the pastor constantly examined his own heart in prayer to God, clarifying his own piety.

Compared to many other trainee pastors present, Zhao Xu skipped many steps and seemed more like an interloper.

Usually, trainee pastors first examine their daily gains and losses in front of the spirits, until finally spending a small amount of time selecting the divine arts bestowed by the spirits, not daring to be negligent at all.

Even the acquisition of some divine arts requires actively communicating with the spirits to be able to obtain them.

But Zhao Xu just said a few formulaic words to the goddess, and then directly entered the dimension of obtaining divine arts.

If other players had the same attitude as him, they would naturally be stuck at the stage of obtaining divine arts.

Offering faith to the spirits, the spirits condense divine power and bestow blessings on the faithful. This is the unchanging principle of Arthur for thousands of years.

After Zhao Xu finished studying the divine arts, the one-hour prayer time for everyone was almost over.

After the pastor's morning class, there was some time left for everyone to arrange on their own, most of them went to read scriptures.

Zhao Xu found a corner and joined a group of players, trying to exchange information.

The current number of players in Mysteria is not large, and those who can reach here have already been through a selection process.

"Did 'Luofeng' successfully promoted to a pastor yesterday?" a tall pastor said.

"Yeah, he was one of the few players who represented in the list of 300 people yesterday. Then he successfully promoted and now he is a trainee pastor with divine arts, so he didn't pray with us." another person replied.
Here is the translation:

As for the few who didn't pass the exam, I think he looks quite gloomy today, hasn't logged on yet," said the novice pastor standing in the corner.

"This place is really dark, I think the other churches on the forum will give players more opportunities. Unlike the Holy Heart, players have to pass the exam to get on the 300-person list. Those old novices who have been here for 15 years can't even pass the exam, and we've only been playing for half a month, let alone pass the exam," said a novice pastor.

"Well, it's okay, those indigenous pastor groups are even harder, even if they pass the exam, they have to rank in the order of seniority and family background to get on the list. At least we can try another profession," said another novice pastor.

"Try another profession? Oh no, the other players don't know, we who are in Mistral still don't know the strength of mages and pastors, and you want me to change to a non-spellcaster profession, can you accept that?" said the tall man.

Saying that, the novice pastor who was called by him suddenly fell silent.

"That's it, we're playing games or games playing us. I'm almost convinced of the goddess's existence from the bottom of my heart," said a slightly plump player.

"Be careful," said a pastor who had been quiet until then.

As soon as this topic was brought up, the novice pastors present all felt a chill in their hearts.

After repeating the daily morning prayers and studying the scriptures, although they are not as devout as the native Arthurians, they are not as arrogant as the outside players, and they dare not blaspheme the gods, even if they have indulged in a bit of gossip.

As time passed, more and more players became immersed in their roles, eventually becoming like method actors, losing themselves in their characters.

"New here?" someone asked Zhao Xu, who was noticed by the players.

The native Arthurian pastors then mostly returned to their dormitories to continue their morning studies.

Only these players who were waiting for the afternoon training session could still chat and gossip here.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu nodded, "Just arrived yesterday."

"Since you've just arrived, you'd better hurry up and delete your character and go to another place," said the tall player at the beginning.

Zhao Xu was astonished, "What special saying is that?"

"It's not what he's saying, it's just that Misterla is the headquarters of the Goddess Church, and the requirements are much stricter here than in other churches," explained the girl who called herself Xiǎo Kě.

"Some churches have players who have already been promoted to 1st-level priests a week ago. We're still stuck here, waiting for players to break through and become 1st-level priests. It's estimated that we'll finish the process in two days."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu also roughly understood the situation and felt a sense of frustration and resentment due to the bottleneck and elitism.

Otherwise, in theory, players in Misterla should be screened and selected based on their talents, and they should graduate faster. It's not acceptable for us to still be stuck here, unable to even join the initial 100-person team, and with no progress on the forum.

At first, Zhao Xu thought it was because there were too few players, but now he realizes it's because they're all stuck.

As for people like Zhao Xu who don't want to read books, they haven't even been promoted to priests.

In the precious time of the game's initial period, all they can do is chat and idle around.

The people around Zhao Xu also briefly explained to him the basics of the Saint Heart Church.

It wasn't until the afternoon that Zhao Xu finally got to attend the training session scheduled by the church.

The priest training course is divided into modules, teaching the profession skills of priests.

As for weapon and armor training, Zhao Xu wasn't in a hurry, and he also couldn't wear heavy armor.
Here is the translation of the text:

While the "self-taught" ability, he had already figured it out on his own yesterday, and he didn't need to receive further training.

He directly looked at the timetable on the table and found the "domain" teaching for the first period.

The pastor is one of the few professions that can rely on divine power to master most abilities on their own.

Because Zhao Xu initially got the wrong door, by the time he arrived at the venue, the pastor who was supposed to teach him had already started.

"The goddess, as a powerful deity, has a vast and powerful domain. As for us pastors, we can choose two domains to specialize in."

"Each time you obtain a domain, you can master the domain's power and spell list."

"The key to determining whether you have mastered a domain is whether you can wield its power."

"At the same time, we will receive a domain spell slot for each level of spell we acquire, allowing us to cast domain spells."

The group of novice pastors all found a quiet spot to sit down, and these knowledgeable pastors had all discussed this topic.

At this moment, they were all patiently listening, not daring to interrupt the old pastor's thoughts.

Zhao Xu stood at the entrance, listened, and then quietly walked in to find a seat.

As soon as he heard the first sentence, his heart jumped involuntarily.

Domain is a powerful ability for pastors, and he is clear about it.

It's just that he doesn't know how powerful the goddess's domain is.

Just then, the pastor began to ask each person to collect their own materials.

In reality, the pastor didn't know how many people would come, so the materials were stacked thickly.

After each person had read their own name, the pastor would take out a parchment from the top and hand it to the other person.
Here is the translation of the text:

Everyone seems to have the same information. Zhao Xu followed the person in front of him and introduced himself to the pastor, mentioning his name and training time. The pastor, as before, took out a sheet of paper from a thick leather-bound book and handed it to him. Zhao Xu's eyes jumped, but he didn't make a sound. He noticed that the pastor was taking out the bottom sheet. While everyone in the room was looking at their own leather-bound book, no one noticed this. Zhao Xu took the paper and nodded slightly in gratitude before slowly returning to his seat. As soon as he sat down, he began to carefully examine the paper. The entire paper did not follow the same format as others, which listed four or five fields for introduction. Instead, there were only three: magic, planning, and knowledge. Moreover, each field had a small note below it. This implies that he will have an additional field compared to others?
