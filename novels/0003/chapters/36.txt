Chapter 37: Trial

Before this, An' Ti Nuoya had tried to deceive him once before, and only revealed the truth afterwards.

Zhou Xu, who had been fooled once before, would not easily fall into the same trap again.

It was too reasonable, just like An' Ti Nuoya said.

Reasonable to the point where it struck his Achilles' heel.

"Teacher, why didn't that old mage, Morcala, accept this technique when he was middle-aged?" Zhou Xu asked, his mind still vivid with the memory of the old mage's gaze.

There was something in that gaze that made Zhou Xu feel a certain emotion.

Only someone who had lived to that age could make a novice like Zhou Xu sense that emotion, and it was too intense.

"It's simple," An' Ti Nuoya said. "He wasn't qualified."

Zhou Xu almost didn't react, "Isn't that right, teacher?"

"Not wrong," An' Ti Nuoya said. "Eternal life is not just one method. Besides mages, there are other professions and channels that can achieve eternal life. Even some advanced individuals can obtain eternal life through alternative means."

"Everything has a price," An' Ti Nuoya said. "Morcala thought he had a chance at legend. So he didn't want to give up and didn't use other methods. As a result, the methods available to him are now limited."

An' Ti Nuoya looked at Zhou Xu as she spoke, "Remember, the purer something is, the easier it is to break through the barrier of legend."

In the past, Zhou Xu had barely touched on anything related to legend, let alone 10th-level magic.

However, in Floating City, An' Ti Nuoya had already mentioned legend-related things to him several times.

It was a good thing to be considered legendary, but the process of turning that into reality was too difficult.
Here is the translation:

"What's the point of not giving that Moka fellow an eternal life with a low price?" Zhao Xu asked involuntarily.

"You can't see past the psychological barrier, and he's always been a 14-level weakling," Anxinyue mocked. "Basically, every time you start in the floating city, the association will create a grid for you, storing your development analysis and all your experience records. Moka's done those messed-up things, and none of the association's top leaders have looked up to him."

Zhao Xu was about to complain.

Moka, a 14-level mage, was like a top-tier strongman to them, good or not.

"Teacher, isn't he still calling you 'teacher'?" Zhao Xu suddenly remembered.

"Hahaha, back when I was their guide, I got stuck with that title, and he's been calling me 'teacher' for decades. I'm dying from the embarrassment."

"He's just harboring illusions, and if his teacher were me, he would have become legendary long ago," Anxinyue said.

Zhao Xu finally understood that the emotion was jealousy.

Zhao Xu and Anxinyue's idle chat didn't last long, and she received a notification for "Telepathy" afterwards, disappearing again.

Before leaving, she handed Zhao Xu a blank silver-bound book, asking him to write his name on the cover and add a drop of blood afterwards. According to her, "Familiarity with Magic" and "Precognition" were two specializations she had already infused with spiritual energy into the book. As long as Zhao Xu read it, the content would appear.

Anxinyue was letting Zhao Xu learn on his own, then log off to sleep.

Tomorrow morning, after a good sleep, he would log back in and start practicing magic, and then begin the mage battle.

The "Familiarity with Magic" specialization was no challenge for Zhao Xu, as he had the heart of a wise mage.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu had learned a few skills from other players for several days. He solved each skill in just a few minutes. The remaining time, he spent studying "Unseen Insight". However, Zhao Xu did not have a spell slot, so he could only learn through intuition. Finally, at around 11 pm, he suddenly felt a sense of emptiness and loss in his mind. He discovered that the skill names "Unseen Insight" and "Spell Mastery" had appeared in the "Defect Reward Skill" section of his character panel. Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile, indicating that he had initially mastered these two skills, and the rest was just a matter of practicing. Then, Zhao Xu teleported back to the real world from the game. At that time, his two roommates were still fighting in the game, wearing their headsets. Another roommate who was preparing for exams was still not back. ArcheAge had not yet reached its peak popularity in society, and there were no signs of a viral phenomenon. However, many students in his class had joined the game. The university environment was like this, where a few people played a game that was interesting enough to attract their classmates to join in. Many students who originally wanted to prove themselves were defeated by the profession of mage, especially the training of mages, and eventually changed their majors. Zhao Xu held a box of "Vitamin Lemon Tea" and walked out to the balcony of his dormitory, unscrewed the straw, and took small sips. He had finally become a 1st-level mage. He slept for eight hours that night and planned to log back into ArcheAge the next day, when he would have a spell slot. In his past life, he had been sick and had to find a "Medic" with upgraded "Medical" skills to treat him, but he couldn't guarantee its effectiveness.

However, a third-grade "Remove Disease" spell can eliminate most diseases.

The spell can do things that are beyond human capabilities.

Even when the paper box was sucked dry, Zhao Xu did not put it down.

His thoughts were already drawn to the battle tomorrow.

Annie Noir said to him when she was leaving.

As long as he can pass the exam, she will give him a magical item as a gift for being a 1st-level mage.

Annie Noir had something on her that was worth less than 10,000 gold pieces?

Zhao Xu didn't believe it.

In the early days, getting an item worth 10,000 gold pieces was considered a divine artifact among players.

However, this mage battle exam is being held in what form?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but sink into deep thought.

Zhao Xu still remembered his spell listâ€”

Zero-level spell list: 3 = 3 (mage)
First-level spell list: 2 = 1 (mage) + 1 (intelligence)
A total of 5 spell slots, 3 zero-level spell slots, and 2 first-level spell slots.

Among them, he had 3 intelligence adjustment values that could be reserved for three spell slots and selected later.

Of course, all were assigned to first-level spell slots.

The remaining two zero-level spell slots only needed to be arranged for what spells to prepare.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu reacted.

Today, Annie Noir rushed away, teaching him two specialties.

However, he still had two specialties left to arrange: "Human Innate Specialty" and "1st-level Mage Specialty".

Was it possible that she was teaching him something based on the results of tomorrow's battle?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but lick his tongue, realizing that he was basically learning things through self-study, and there were no free lunches in large organizations. His gaze also gradually became firm.
He is good at both striving and working hard.
