Chapter 315, Earth Channel

When Lin Qi spoke, Zhao Xu also laughed, but his mood was quite cheerful.

From the moment he entered the game, he encountered most of the people in the floating city who were very polite to him, and some even directly gave him resources. Those who could cooperate did cooperate.

For example, the goddess priest, Sos, whom he met at the Holy Heart Cathedral, directly gave him a saintly badge that he had worn for decades. Later, Zhao Xu used that badge to avoid explaining his identity-related troubles.

Even the mineral deposits in the Starfall Town were entrusted to Sos, who directly placed the secret silver crystal into the silver vein to increase the yield of secret silver.

As for Lin Qi, who was previously very polite to him, he now showed a sharp and cunning look, making Zhao Xu feel familiar with the residents of Arthur's era that he had previously interacted with.

"Lin Qi, the wizard, don't you know what you need to compensate?" Zhao Xu naturally agreed if the other party's request was not too excessive.

As a 5th-level wizard, he himself had sufficient resources to exchange and complement with others.

When Lin Qi, the stout wizard, heard Zhao Xu's response, he nodded with a smile and said, "Ah, Mr. Zhongxue, could you please hand over the badge on your chest for me to take a look?"

Zhao Xu immediately thought that the other party was going to ask for something related to this, but he didn't say much and handed it over directly.

However, among the wizards who appeared in the floating city, those who could run away with the badge would also be unable to escape the temple.

After that, Lin Qi finally paid attention to the badge on Zhao Xu's robe, which had changed into three concentric circles, indicating that the opponent had officially registered as a three-ring wizard.

Zhao Xu updated his identity information to the latest status in the association's transaction hall, and at the same time, he obtained the corresponding wizard benefits.

The wizard association is the largest wizard organization on the Arthurian continent, with the most wizards. In addition to being the organization with the most wizards, it also has a benefit that attracts countless ordinary wizards.

All wizards can apply to record two of the highest-level spells they can currently cast when they level up.

Zhao Xu obtained a 2-5 level upgrade benefit and received qualifications for recording two one-ring spells at the 2nd level, four two-ring spells at the 3rd and 4th levels, and two three-ring spells at the 5th level.

According to the association's current recording price, each ring costs 50 gold coins, and the recording fee for a three-ring spell is 150 gold coins.

Zhao Xu obtained a total of eight recording coupons worth 800 gold coins, covering the recording fees for one to three rings.

As he himself had mastered all spells from one to three rings, he could easily sell those coupons or use them as compensation when Lin Qi asked for spell recording or gold.

However, after Lin Qi saw Zhao Xu's badge, he suddenly shuddered, and the three concentric circles seemed like a mysterious incantation, directly mesmerizing him.

At the same time, these concentric circles began to oscillate when touched by Lin Qi, demonstrating their authenticity.

Linch's back suddenly broke out in cold sweat as he realized that the other party was an Earth Adventurer. However, this Summer Wizard was only a one-ring wizard a month ago, and had become a three-ring wizard in just a month. Even if players themselves accelerated their leveling, this speed was still unreasonably fast.

According to what he had heard from his elders at home, even if Earth Adventurers had sufficient innate talent, it would take them at least a year to reach the three-ring level. Now, someone was showing off a month's worth of progress and becoming a three-ring wizard? If he were to spread this news, it would likely stir up a storm among the low-ranking wizards in the Floating City.

The wizards in the Floating City were well aware of the reason why Earth Adventurers could accelerate their leveling, and also knew the hidden dangers behind it. Players who skipped several years or even decades of accumulation would only end up paying a huge price for their shortcuts in the future. The most obvious consequence was that it would become much harder to break through levels in the future, especially when it came to the five- and six-ring levels.

Lin's thoughts suddenly turned to numerous important speculations. There were also cases in the Wizard's Association where players had completed their training and leveled up in just a month. These exceptional individuals would be given special attention and become future legendary wizards.

Lin couldn't help but feel a sense of awe, wondering why the Association's high-ranking officials had given a player a shining silver badge. It turned out that the Association's top officials had already discovered the player's innate talent a month ago. No wonder they were the big shots, while he was just a small fry.

After Lin Qi thought carefully, he respectfully handed the badge back to Zhao Xu and said, "That's settled then."

"Zhong Xia, our association meeting hasn't been scheduled for the past two days. How about we go to the association office tomorrow to pick up the document file? If it's inconvenient, I can also send it to your dormitory."

As Lin Qi spoke, he looked at Zhao Xu with a pleading expression.

"This? Compensation?" Zhao Xu was puzzled by Lin Qi's sudden change in attitude.

"Oh, you've just taken a close look at the badge's miraculous properties, and that's already the greatest compensation," Lin Qi said with a standard wizard's bow.

"...," Zhao Xu was speechless, unable to understand Lin Qi's sudden change in attitude.

Logically, Lin Qi should have known that Zhao Xu had the shining silver badge from the beginning. After discovering that Lin Qi was a player and not from the Mistral family of wizards, his attitude became more relaxed. However, he suddenly became very respectful again.

For Zhao Xu's suggestion, he considered that he lived in the Fang Jian Tower, and it would be difficult for Lin Qi to enter. He directly said, "Lin Qi, I'll come find you tomorrow."

Lin Qi nodded in satisfaction and handed over a note with his contact information and address.

Zhao Xu took it and suddenly heard the voice of Anniya in his ear.

"Zhong Xia, do you want to look at a research related to your magic spells?"

...
Here is the translation of the text:

This location is situated at the heart of the floating city, beneath the "Hall of Truth", where Zhao Xu once removed the mysterious stone monument and obtained the corresponding advanced teachings.

It is said that the Hall of Truth is the location with the highest concentration of magical energy in the Arthurian legend.

The highest authority of the Mage Association, the "Council of Evaluation", is also permanently stationed within the Hall of Truth.

According to everyone's account, it is only here that one can simultaneously witness the seven giants of the Mage Association appearing together.

Zhao Xu initially thought that this was a football stadium without a grandstand when he first saw this research hall. However, they are all standing on the second-floor corridor, with only a simple crash barrier in front of them, which is quite simple or didn't even consider the presence of spectators.

The floor below is where the mysterious alchemy equipment is located, with many devices wrapped up tightly. The majority of the devices are made of mysterious metal balls.

Above the research hall is the alchemy equipment transport device, which can be controlled to adjust the heavy alchemy equipment at any time, although the mages themselves can use magic to solve the problem.

At this moment, there are dozens of mages conducting debugging work on the floor, while Zhao Xu is secretly shocked because the researchers below are all at least seven-ring mages.

Some assistant work is being done by the demons and invisible servants inside the hall.

Zhao Xu felt the heavy and solemn atmosphere inside the hall, and he was standing quietly beside Anzhiya, while the same number of mages as the research personnel on the second floor corridor were standing there.

However, they were all dressed in mage robes and hoods, hiding their external appearance.

Zhao Xu was suspicious that the mysterious people might include the giants of the Mage Association.
Here is the translation:

However, he paid more attention to the eight metal panels standing upright in front of him, made entirely of secret silver, with intricate carvings of complex ritual arrays on each panel. These arrays were so intricate that even the smallest details were carved to a high degree of precision.

It was clear that the ritual was extremely complex and profound.

"Master, the research on this spell looks very advanced," Zhao Xu said, using his mental link to communicate with Anithnoja.

Even the lowest-level researchers were Level 7, and other auxiliary personnel would not allow junior mages to intervene. Anithnoja had even given him a special pass after he had undergone three to four rounds of scrutiny before entering.

"This, of course, is because they will establish a temporary portal to other multiverse dimensions soon," Anithnoja said.

As it turned out, it was indeed a grand gesture.

Zhao Xu could only express his astonishment.

To be honest, Arthur might not have the budget to undertake this research project.

Zhao Xu had already realized that the research was essentially for a mass crossing a year from now.

As he looked at the intricate ritual arrays, he had some guesses, but after listening to Anithnoja's explanation, he had new doubts.

"But I think this ritual is more like reopening the portal, rather than creating a new one, isn't it?"

Anithnoja raised an eyebrow, "That's right. There has always been an energy channel between us and Arthur, and now we're using this energy channel to materialize a material channel."

Zhao Xu listened and suddenly had countless thoughts in his mind, further confirming his own thoughts.

They could project themselves over, which meant that there was indeed an energy channel between Arthur and the earth.

Even the 20-minute cooling time limit after shutting down and restarting was likely due to the limitations of this energy channel.

Since there was already an energy channel, the Mage Association could easily use it.
Here is the translation:

Then, the project leader's researcher on the lower floor raised a questioning gesture towards a mysterious person on the second-floor corridor.

"Let's start the charging test," Anshinoya reminded.

Zhao Xu suddenly widened his eyes and carefully observed the status of the eight secret silver panels, waiting for all energy channels to necessarily pass through this ritual array to be stimulated.

Suddenly, countless starlight began to converge and fall on the first panel of the secret silver panels, energy flowing like a gentle stream, filling the entire ritual array carved into the empty space.

Finally, each of the eight silver panels lit up, shining all the way to the seventh panel.

However, Zhao Xu felt a sudden vibration throughout his body, and his vision began to blur.

【Adventurer, your connection to the Arthurian world has been disconnected, please wait for a cooling-down period: to be determined.]
