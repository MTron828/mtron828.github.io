Chapter 481: The Burning Divine Fragment

After Freyer arrived, he saw Zhao Xu and the others all gathered in the manor he had arranged.

According to the reports of the maids and bodyguards, the three people did not show any signs of going out. In fact, they were seen walking out of the door one by one during this time.

This eliminated any suspicion.

"I vaguely heard some commotion from outside, it seems something has happened tonight?" Zhao Xu asked first.

Freyer, the great-nephew of the Tang De leader, immediately revealed most of the information he knew.

He also informed Vivian and Bai Long about what had just happened.

Bai Long suddenly slapped his thigh with a look of deep regret.

As for Vivian, she put away the long sword she had been holding on Bai Long's neck when Freyer arrived.

Just then, a servant from outside knocked on the door and entered, whispering something in Freyer's ear.

Freyer suddenly slapped his thigh, "This is probably a big deal, and many temples are involved."

"Discovering a desecration?" Bai Long, as a third-party person, suddenly looked delighted.

Freyer shook his head, "I heard it's the trail of an evil spirit."

As for Zhao Xu, he smiled silently to himself.

At the same time, his mind was also communicating with Lark, who was constantly laughing.

When Zhao Xu and Vivian left, he and Lark communicated briefly and decided to play a big scene, using each other's strengths.

As he left behind the name "Grazzit", one of the strongest evil lords of the deep abyss, and had the other party "innocently" entangled in the situation.
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as there is a search, as long as there is no one to notice, it will be difficult to conceal. Arthur generally involves events related to "profaning the gods", "purgatory", and "ghosts" and will respectfully invite the temple to participate. In the past, Zhao Xu encountered an event where he summoned the ritual of resurrection, resulting in the summoning of evil spirits. As a result, the existence of the "Rose Cross" was directly shocked.

Tonight, he left behind a name, with a high enough level and still connected to the devilish king "Tangde". For Zhao Xu, it's a two-for-one deal, as he can not only satisfy the previous requirements but also observe the changes in Tangde's leadership by leaving behind the "Grazzite" stone.

However, Zhao Xu is not too excited about this. In fact, he has known the route of operation after joining the "Rose Cross" and becoming a high-level inspector.

Once he does this, with the temple's strong intervention, many things that wanted to be concealed will inevitably be difficult to conceal. At this moment, Zhao Xu is relying on the fragments of the god of death to unlock the ability, and Lakshmi has further grasped this ability, so she dares to be so reckless.

So, she has sealed many on-site information and secrets, helping Zhao Xu avoid the possibility of being discovered. Even now, under her deliberate influence, it is impossible to identify Zhao Xu's grasp of the three-ring god technique. Without the help of Anniel or Xisilvina to hide, ordinary mages can see some information on him, but a part of it will be blocked.

After discussing it in detail, Freyl confirmed that there was nothing wrong on Zhao Xu's side and reminded him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tomorrow, we will go to the wizard's association together, and then invite him to attend the high-level gathering of the alliance held at the commander's office in the evening.

As Zhao Xu thought about this, his heart began to stir.

The high-level gathering of the alliance refers to the powerful members of the alliance.

Once they are trapped in this grand gathering or even a dance party, it may be the perfect opportunity for Zhao Xu to sneak into the treasure of Kuriloz.

Currently, the soul of Kuriloz is also being restrained by Zhao Xu's "Soul Binding Spell" at the top of the legendary death staff.

No matter how cunning and sly he is, Zhao Xu is still a pawn in his hands, and he can be crushed and molded at will.

After Freyr left, Zhao Xu also slightly edited his experience of the evening and simply briefed the dragon and the demon about it.

"This?" Even the fearless dragon Serus couldn't help but look around nervously, thinking about the best route to escape in case of a disaster.

Because he had never thought that tonight's events would actually be caused by Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu didn't give him a chance to continue thinking, and also briefly conveyed his plan to infiltrate the treasure of Kuriloz and dig it up at the gathering tonight.

"Hey, Zhongxia Wizard, won't you attend that gathering tomorrow night?" Serus asked Zhao Xu with a strange expression.

"I'll come up with a reason and hide for a while," Zhao Xu said. "I can get there quickly using the 'Teleportation Spell' on my staff, and I won't even need to take a step."

"Looks like you're out of touch," Serus sneered.

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked in response.
Here is the translation of the text:

Viola suddenly joined the conversation, saying, "In essence, tonight's banquet is just a gathering for the high-level officials' children to get to know each other."

"What do you mean by 'get to know each other'?" Zhao Xu asked, a bit confused.

"Not exactly 'get to know each other', but just a casual meeting to exchange feelings," White Dragon Selsius said with a condescending tone.

"So, Zhongxia, you shouldn't miss the party or sneak away halfway. I heard that Miss Fleure, who is said to be a beauty, will also be attending the party. Many young men from the city of Auror are already excitedly preparing for it."

"After all, it's a dance party, and you'll have a dance partner when you get there. It's not good to leave someone and sneak back," White Dragon Selsius said, as if expecting something.

"Are you going?" Zhao Xu asked.

White Dragon Selsius nodded hastily, as if eagerly anticipating something.

"That place is said to have a treasure trove of martial arts skills, and you won't be able to ensure your safety when you get there," Zhao Xu threatened.

White Dragon Selsius heard the sound of a whetstone grinding away, as if it had been transmitted to his ear.

He thought for a moment and then gave up in despair.

Zhao Xu didn't bother to explain and simply pulled out a blank sheet of paper and started drawing a battle plan to infiltrate the treasure trove.

It wasn't until late at night that White Dragon Selsius left his room.

Meanwhile, Viola simply washed her face and went to sleep on a newly made small bed.

Zhao Xu didn't fall asleep or enter a deep sleep. Instead, he silently gazed at his character card.

The only change on the card was the addition of a new line, "Death God Fragment (Awakening)"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Xu was lounging on the couch, with a teapot still warm on the tea table, and tea leaves scattered around it, floating in the air.

Outside, the commotion had also subsided, and the entire Frelle residence had fallen silent.

"Larsa, what's going on with this divine fragment awakening?" Zhang Xu asked.

"Heh heh, Master, you've gotten stronger," Larsa replied.

"I think it's more than that," Zhang Xu said.

"Well, Master, it represents both good and bad news. Which one do you want to hear?" Larsa asked.

"The bad news," Zhang Xu said.

"That means, Master, if you don't obtain the remaining divine fragments in a short time, you may have to treat this fragment like a fleeting fireworks display," Larsa said.

"Plainly speaking?" Zhang Xu asked.

"That means you've lost the possibility of using it to become divine," Larsa said.

"And what's the good news?" Zhang Xu asked.

"Well, Master, during this unlocking process, you can act freely and recklessly. Even if we need to transform the divine artifact, we won't reveal our identities," Larsa said.

Zhang Xu had already translated this conversation in his mind.

It's clear that respected player, your current external equipment has been activated for a limited time.

"Ah, Larsa, since that's the case, let's head to the Mage Association tomorrow and unleash the most unrestrained fireworks display," Zhang Xu said.

"Ah? Master?" Larsa asked.

"It's a done deal, Master. To prepare for the prestige and authority I'll need when I become the head of the association. I need to make the name of Zhong Xia shine on this land," Zhang Xu said.

The voice in Zhang Xu's mind and Larsa's self-mumbling was not loud, but firm and unwavering.
