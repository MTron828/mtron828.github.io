Chapter 296: His Pastor

According to Arthur's rules, a 20-level difference is equivalent to a complete crushing.

At this moment, all members of the Guardian's Guild stared with their mouths agape, watching the 80-level boost come and go four times. Even those with a full stomach of poetry could only replace it with a coarse phrase.

Everyone was accustomed to the pastor's "blessing spell" and the bard's "motivational poetry" - these common positive buffs that could only lift the level by 1. On the other hand, the skills that were most important for determining the outcome of combat, such as "scouting" and "listening", were always the focus of everyone's attention.

However, even the most optimistic player could hardly imagine the possibility of an 80-level boost.

At this moment, the rogue thief raised his head, who originally had a 6-level "scouting" skill. After a sudden 80-level boost, he discovered that the valley in front of him had become incredibly vivid and detailed.

The steep mountainside on the opposite bank was covered with dense foliage, and every possible hiding spot was clearly visible to him.

At this moment, he felt as if countless eyes were watching him, as if they were perceiving the world for him.

In addition to the 80-level boost, his "listening" skill had also been upgraded.

Even the faintest insect sounds in the surrounding environment were crystal clear to him, not to mention the rustling of leaves in the breeze or the sound of his companions' footsteps on the pebbles.
At this moment, it is impossible for anyone to easily approach the Guardian's Guild. Suddenly, he felt a sense of wanting to cry, having played the game for a whole two months. With the help of his 80th-level skill, he finally experienced the beauty of this world. However, as the one who caused all this, Zhao Xu was saying, "The duration of the spell is only a few minutes, why not take the time to cross the river?" Hearing Zhao Xu's words, the Frost Sword, who had also seen the scene with the added effect of his 80th-level scouting skill, quickly calmed his mind and said, "Let's advance in the previous order."

The guild members immediately lined up along the riverbank, directly drawing their bows and preparing to shoot, with mages, clerics, and bards on the side, ready to cast their spells. On the other side, players who possessed the "Swimming" skill or high strength were leading the carriages carrying the float bridges to cross the river.

Zhao Xu saw this scene and was not surprised. In fact, he had also seen the opposing side bring a portable bridge that could be assembled after crossing the river, which made him think of using the "Shadow Steed" skill. Otherwise, he would have to face the embarrassment of being unable to cast the three-ring god's "Water Walking" spell.

At this moment, a few players also gathered around, enthusiastically asking Zhao Xu, "Wind Mage, what kind of spell is that? Or do you have a scroll?" Zhao Xu was also a bit at a loss, mainly because this was a unique spell of the Ranger, and players at least needed to be 4th level to cast it. Without the added effect of the Perception talent, they would have to wait until they reached 6th level to obtain the one-ring god's skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Investigation Network" spell only takes effect within the spell's range. The more companions Zhao Xu has, the more his "Investigation" and "Listening" skills will be upgraded by 2 levels. Therefore, when he joins the "Wardens" guild with 40 members, he directly gains an 80-level upgrade.

As a result, everyone shares their observations with each other, forming a complementary advantage. Since this spell is a "fixed-distance" spell that lasts for 1 minute per level, it also meets the prerequisite for spell duration.

After thinking for a moment, Zhao Xu smiled and said, "Protocol Two: Don't ask about the mage's spells."
Although Zhao Xu said this, after he cast the spell and rode the three-ring mount, the entire team suddenly looked at him with newfound respect.

Zhao Xu's reputation had reached a level that could be counted among the top few.

A rogue player in the reserve position looked at the warrior monk next to him and whispered, "Hey, it feels like the magic goddess has arrived. I can even find her. Who knows if I'll be able to sneak up on her."

However, the monk standing beside him immediately said, "Your thoughts of desecration are very dangerous."
The rogue player immediately fell silent. Without saying much, the team knew that they would soon be at war and would need the help of the mage lady behind them.

As the mage player joined the team, everyone gradually gained a deeper understanding of the gods. Meanwhile, a sense of reverence was gradually established.

However, Zhao Xu did not relax due to the 80-level upgrade in "Investigation" and "Listening". Having cast the nine-ring spell, he had realized that only "certainty" was safe and reliable.
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as the enemy is caught off guard, even if they discover us a step late, we can still rely on our own consciousness to perform a 5v5. Or, like Zhao Xu, who has "secondary rapid burst," we can cheat. At this point, as the first batch of players arrived at the riverbank, Frost Sword began to gradually direct everyone to start building a float bridge. This was to enable players with average strength or no swimming skill level to cross the bridge. Zhao Xu also felt that with a large number of players and high average quality, the team itself had a certain deterrent effect, capable of intimidating small fries. From then on, until the early morning journey, Zhao Xu had a smooth and peaceful journey. After indicating that he could arrange things on his own, the entire "Sentinel" guild then dispersed and went offline. Zhao Xu then waited until everyone had gone offline, and then directly used the "Invisibility Ring" to become invisible and went offline.

This time, Zhao Xu woke up around 7:30 PM. He opened his phone to look at the recent situation while thinking about the actions and losses of the previous day. He had established a simple reputation through a few spells, and it had taken root in the hearts of players. At critical moments, his words could be effective. However, unexpectedly, Zhao Xu even got a divine power this time, but his body did not undergo any changes. His roommate, Zhang Qi, was still wearing his helmet and had not gone offline. After occupying the "Fallen Star Lake," players were busy managing the city's affairs. Even nearby university students were still fighting late at night, digesting the resources they had obtained after occupying the city. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was waiting with a sense of anticipation for the harvest process, having already sown the seeds.
Here is the translation:

At this moment, he walked to his desk and only then noticed that Zhang Qi had already taken the express delivery for him.

Looking at the express delivery, he saw that the sender was a ticketing website, and Zhao Xu immediately understood what was going on.

He directly and neatly tore open the packaging, taking out a concert ticket from inside.

On the ticket, he saw a smiling photo of a pair of twins, but what caught his attention was the VIP seating area label.

In his previous life, he had bought a regular ticket to watch this concert a week later due to his love for it.

It wasn't until he and his wife talked about it that he realized they had actually gotten close at a concert in their previous life.

Memories of the past flashed through his mind, and the laughter and sounds of his previous life echoed in his ears.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile bitterly: "This life, getting close to you, the lady, is much harder than in my previous life."

In reality, it wasn't Arthur's time travel that shattered everything in his previous life, and Zhao Xu was unlikely to be with his new wife.

Especially after experiencing initial difficulties and hardships in their daily life, many people had come to realize that their previous life's social status and family background were no longer reliable.

As for ordinary people, even if they had a thousand schemes in their hearts, they could only feel helpless when facing professionals.

Because Arthur had magical powers, special abilities, and supernatural abilities, which even outweighed numerical advantages.

Arthur's "professional level" was the greatest guarantee.

This was also the reason why the Earth's forces became professionals and embraced Arthur's system.

Even Zhao Xu's previous wife's family was initially supported by her pastor's identity.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xu has already mastered the "hypnotic technique" of the Three Rings and can make people follow his suggestions and take action. If he had this ability on Earth, it wouldn't be impossible for him to climb to the top.

Zhao Xu quickly recovered from his previous sentimental state and opened the computer file he had saved earlier. His gaze fell on a string of activation codes.

He needed to give this string of numbers to her.

However, Zhao Xu's expression gradually became blank, and the string of numbers seemed to reassemble into a word in his mind - "pastor". Becoming his pastor.
