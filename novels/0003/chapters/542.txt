Chapter 543: The Teleportation Gate, the Arrival at the Destination

"How did we just trigger another big commotion?" A martial monk player looked in the direction of the wizard's guild, wondering.

It's not a traditional holiday in the north, but he vaguely saw that all the high-ranking officials in the town had gathered there.

Even the mine manager, who rarely appeared in public, was there, representing the interests of the powerful figures of the alliance, even though the town had been conquered by the previous night's attack.

"You didn't see the forum?" Another player, standing at the blacksmith's door, shook his head as he waited for his newly repaired giant sword to be fixed.

"What's going on? I rushed all night yesterday, and I didn't go offline the whole time, so I don't know what kind of message was posted on the forum," the martial monk wondered.

"Yes, the town lord, Xun Xia, didn't he just break through to level 9?" The barbarian player said.

"Yeah, I know that, it's indeed impressive. As for others, even if they gossip, what's the point? With just one breakthrough, they can wipe the faces of all others clean," the martial monk sighed.

As he spoke, he gazed at his own fist, seemingly fantasizing about the day he could also unleash a fist that could shatter all doubts.

Meanwhile, the barbarian player looked into the blacksmith's shop, nodded slightly, and said, "Xun Xia, the top player, has just returned, and he brought back a high-tech item."

"Oh, what's the big deal about high-tech? Are you thinking of the Earth or something, with industrial 4.0?" The martial monk scoffed.
Here is the translation:

"You're naive." The player in a barbarian tone, as if they had just experienced the wind and frost, "That's a portal!" "I'm going!"

As soon as the words were spoken, the monk who had just been curious suddenly fell silent.

A device worth a thousand gold, an "Mysterious Magic Device" that most players have never touched in their lifetime.

At this time, players and local residents in the small town, although they knew that the wizard's guild had not yet completed the construction of the wizard's guild, could not help but rush to the portal after hearing the news.

Compared to the portal that only remained inside the wizard's guild's stern gate or the rarely visited ancient tomb, the portal in Starfall Town was about to be built, and the moment the news spread, it ignited the attention of all the townspeople.

The town's high-end residents, naturally, felt that they had gained a special channel from now on, and in the future, they would not have to spend a heavy 450 gold coins to cross the vast continent without Arthur. They could request the "Portal Spell" from the five-ring wizard.

However, the key is that it's not too accurate.

The accurate seven-ring "Advanced Portal Spell" with a double 910 gold coin incantation fee is even more painful.

Players discovered that the "distance" restriction that blocked all players' freedom of movement had seemingly broken a thread.

Especially as the lord of the summer, who was also a player, it was uncertain whether he would take out the portal and pay to use it, rather than keeping it secret like the wizard's guild.

Therefore, the mysterious magic device that can connect two positions on the continent through a dimensional channel, instantly became the hottest topic in the town.

The surrounding cities also directed their attention to it.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The current sponsors in the game, including some powerful guilds with a strong financial background, have realized that Zhao Xu, who is capable of building a portal, has a terrifying channel. The two parties do not have a foundation for equal negotiations.

"I remember that the scale of Starfall Town does not conform to any of the '19th article of the Portal Strategy' clauses. How can the guild send someone to establish a portal?" Wang Qingwei asked beside Zhao Xu, looking at the wizards from Mistral who had been dispatched.

Zhao Xu nodded and rubbed his fingers together. "It's simple."

"What, money?" Wang Qingwei asked in surprise.

If money were useful, the wizard guild would not be criticized for being unresponsive.

"No, it's a seal of the goddess," Zhao Xu said.

"This door is wide open," Wang Qingwei couldn't help but snicker.

Arthur didn't just have the technique of controlling the portal, some high-ranking priests of secret sects, mysterious organizations, and dark evil forces also had the skill. However, the portal itself has extremely high restrictions.

Whether it's one-way or two-way transmission, the portal requires a clear transmission area, which means that a "door" must be established at that location, and it cannot be moved from then on.

The wizard guild's portal network is the largest. Just like a phone, other forces' portals are just a single-line fixed phone, only able to communicate between two units. The wizard guild's portal has already formed a network, and as long as the permission is opened, it can point to the wizard guild's portal in other towns.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu held the "Goddess's" seal in his hand, which immediately granted him the highest level of permission. He was now able to choose which locations to open up, unlike some towns that could only connect to a single point, such as Mistral. At this moment, Wang Qingwei unfolded the portal design diagram in his hand and nodded, saying, "Building a portal requires a specialized skill in manufacturing portals, as well as the ability to use teleportation, high-level teleportation, interdimensional portals, or teleportation arrays. Moreover, manufacturing portals also requires a specialized skill in manufacturing rare items. It's no wonder you need to hire someone from Mistral." Wang Qingwei was well aware of Zhao Xu's capabilities.

The opponent had potential points that could simulate specialized skills. However, Zhao Xu was currently lacking two specialized skills, and unless he was willing to consume 2 potential points to use up his reserves, he could only simulate the skill of manufacturing rare items.

Rare items are the most comprehensive category of magical items, excluding weapons, shields, armor, rings, wands, staffs, and potions. Each type of rare item corresponds to a specialized skill in manufacturing.

"Thank goodness Mistral is less than 5000 kilometers away from the northern hemisphere, otherwise I would have to set up another portal. These construction tools are a real pain to transport." Zhao Xu sighed.

The transmission distance of the teleportation art is 160 kilometers per level, which means that Zhao Xu, as a 30-level mage, could easily teleport a distance of 5000 kilometers. The radius of the Earth is over 6000 kilometers, and the north-south and east-west ends of China are over 5000 kilometers apart. Now, Zhao Xu, who is standing on Earth, is a true giant who can cover 1000 li (about 48 kilometers) in a day.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, your strength is exceptional too," Wang Congwei nodded slightly.

The cargo capacity of the teleportation item cannot exceed the maximum carrying capacity of Zhao Xu, so it's not a problem for him to exceed 40 points of strength. He can carry an additional medium-sized creature every three levels, which is more than enough for the craftsmen and mages who are transporting the teleportation gates.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh at the thought of the five-ring mage who could transport himself over a thousand kilometers, and the surprise he felt when he heard that he could cross over five thousand kilometers.

"However, after this time, I've decided to establish a teleportation gate between the 'Descendant's Land' and the small town," Zhao Xu said.

At this moment, Wang Congwei looked at Zhao Xu with a playful expression and asked, "Are you sure that the association doesn't have a plan for this time, and is it because you've learned to make 'odd items' with your 9th-level expertise?"

Wang Congwei instantly analyzed Zhao Xu's possible movements.

At this moment, they were standing in a temporary wooden hut, surrounded by "Mages' Secrecy" - a five-ring mage's spell that blocked external sight and sound transmission, and allowed them to not worry about being discovered by outsiders.

When Wang Congwei asked the question, Zhao Xu glanced at his current specialization list:

**Deficiency Specialization 1: Familiarity with Magic (Vulnerable to Injury)

**Deficiency Specialization 2: Precognitive Ability (Administrative Staff)

**Human Reward Specialization: Multi-Talented Mage

**1st-Level Specialization: Combat Magic

**3rd-Level Specialization: Item Enchantment

**6th-Level Specialization: Magic Duplication

**9th-Level Specialization: (Empty)

**Super Mage Specialization (Mage 5): Enduring Magic

**Super Mage Specialization (Plasticity 2): Distant Magic Transmission

**Super Mage Storm (1 year): Magical Efficiency"
Here is the translation:

"Muddled Dual Wash (Steel Will): Instant Cast
Priest Domain (Plan): Delayed Cast
Well, I'm still lacking in specialization!
Zhao Xu shook his head, "I don't plan it that way."
"It's mainly that I've recently realized that the 'Potential Point' is more effective for me."
"There are too many specializations that have pre-requisites for other specializations, forming a chain. And the premise of simulating specializations is to meet the pre-requisites of the specializations."
"However, you cannot use the Potential Point inherent to your nature." Wang Qingwei pointed out.
No doubt, Zhao Xu's current 9-point Potential Point is based on the premise of "Unbridled Heroic Spirit", and once he uses it up, he loses all possibilities.
"Qingwei."
Zhao Xu said, and a deep smile appeared on his face, "This is the harvest of my trip to the divine kingdom of the goddess this time."
"Outside of Unbridled Heroic Spirit, there is another way to obtain Potential Points, even if you don't have any yourself!"
"Do you want to hear it?"
Zhao Xu's words fell like a thunderbolt, directly piercing Wang Qingwei's heart."
