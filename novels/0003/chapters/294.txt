Chapter 295: Skills that are Hard to Imagine

One of the most notable aspects of Arthur is that everyone is always consistent. No one has additional special abilities just because they are NPCs. Whatever abilities NPCs have, players can also have, which has become a widely accepted fact. Therefore, it takes 10 minutes for players to cast the three-ring spell "Shadow Steed", which means that Arthur's native wizardry is also the same.

"Is it instantaneous?" Snow asked, who had some knowledge of magic but not much, and directly asked the wizard Chen who was standing beside him.

However, Chen shook his head, "Instantaneous magic can only compress the 'standard action' into 'swift action', but for spells that take more than one round of casting time, they are all invalid."

"So how did he do it?" Snow asked again.

Just then, the Guildmaster Frost Blade, who was standing on the side, seemed to ignore the scene unfolding before him and whispered to the other dozens of guild members nearby to prepare to set out. However, his tight grip on the sword hilt still revealed his inner tension.

As the Guildmaster of the guild, Frost Blade was well aware that if he could turn a spell with a long casting time into one that only takes one round of casting time, the strategic value of such a spell would be immeasurable.

Especially, many players would give up on spells that take 1 minute to cast. After all, casting spells is not just a matter of clicking a button on a computer or saying it takes a minute to cast. It really takes 1 minute to cast.

It's also the reason why the wizard needs to spend an hour preparing the spell, which has deterred many people. In fact, it has even forced the wizard to conserve spell slots, so that he can avoid preparing the spell or spend less time preparing it for the next day.

Considering that the opponent directly consumed a "three-ring" spell slot to rush, Snow Sword couldn't help but think deeply about the true level of this wizard.

He didn't believe that an ordinary 5th-level wizard could achieve such a feat.

As Snow Sword thought about this, he felt a headache coming on.

He had already realized that the final harvest was divided, and he still needed to supplement something for the opponent.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, didn't think much about it.

"Unusual Premonition" is his specialty, which not only allows him to grasp the spell and manipulate his spell slots, but also has another powerful effect, specifying that he can cast non-"Spell Mastery" spells within a single round.

So, he didn't hesitate to cast those spells that took an hour or 10 minutes to cast.

The "Shadow Steed" spell, which Zhao Xu had long been envious of seeing wizards casting it, was something he had been eager to try out.

"Mr. Wizard, what's the difference between your three-ring 'Shadow Steed' spell and the ordinary one-ring 'Summon Mount' spell?"

At this time, everyone took out their personal weapons and shields, preparing to set out. The core wanderer of the guild, "Thief", approached Zhao Xu's Shadow Steed to ask.

"Summon Mount summons a projection of a miniature horse, which is not much different from a normal miniature horse, except for the duration difference. The Shadow Steed, on the other hand, is a custom-made mount."

Wizard Chen Nu interrupted at this point, his appearance and tone both calm and peaceful.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the difference?" the wandering cultivator asked, not willing to stop asking questions, only to find that Chen Nu was struggling to answer. At this moment, Zhao Xu finally realized that the mage in front of him was none other than his past life's high-rolling Chen Nu.

Chen Nu was only at the 2nd level, and his equipment was plain and simple, just like the many high-rolling players who had gone through a rough period.

Zhao Xu couldn't bear to see his opponent fall into an awkward situation, so he directly interrupted and said, "The speed of the 'Mysterious Steed' is faster. As the caster's level increases, the speed also increases. At full speed, a 5th-level caster can reach 20 meters per second."

In other words, if Zhao Xu's horse ran at full speed for an hour, its speed would be 72 kilometers per hour.

As a 7th-level caster, Zhao Xu could increase the speed by another 20%.

Furthermore, this was a horse that would not tire easily.

Even when Zhao Xu became a 8th-level caster, this horse could gallop on sandy and muddy terrain at full speed.

By the time Zhao Xu reached the 10th level, this horse could move on water. At the 12th level, it could fly for one round. And at the 14th level, it could transform into a flying horse.

As Zhao Xu rode out of the post station, the other horses around him saw him and instinctively backed away.

It wasn't until everyone had left the city that Chen Nu, relying on his "Mysterious Knowledge" skill, recalled the detailed abilities of the "Mysterious Steed".

The guild players heard Chen Nu's explanation and couldn't help but gaze at Zhao Xu's mount with shining eyes.

"One 3-ringed spell could achieve this? That's too awesome!"

"No way, I have to become a mage too!"

"Ah, you didn't sign up for it, did you? I remember you were arranged to go to Atter City."

At this moment, Zhao Xu was sitting comfortably on the Mysterious Steed, holding a magic tome in his hand and reading it.
The super magic wand was fastened to the saddle, ready to be pulled out at any time to fight at the slightest movement. Like the other guild players who were preparing to go into the water, they were prioritized to save energy by arranging them to pull the cargo carriage. Most of the guild players were walking on the post road outside Mysterla City. Seeing Zhao Xu riding the Shadow Horse under him, Frost Sword actually felt a little heartache. The "Water Breathing" scroll was bought by him through connections with Chen Nuo in the Mage Association. Who would have thought that Zhao Xu would waste a Tier 3 spell slot just to rush on the road. When he made the request to the Mage Association before, he specifically left a requirement. First, it had to be a kind camp, and secondly, it had to be a mage who could cast the "Water Breathing" spell. It's a pity that this spell itself is too obscure, and unless it's a port city, mages would never prioritize it in their learning sequence. And unfortunately, Frost Sword's requirement also got stuck with a Level 5 mage, so the waiting process made him very anxious. When he finally received the news that a mage had taken on the task, Frost Sword and other guild leaders couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. At this time, Frost Sword directly pulled Chen Nuo and whispered to him, "Go ask Mr. Kuangfeng. If the other party also plans to use a Shadow Horse to rush on the day after tomorrow, let's negotiate and have him prepare a Tier 1 summoning mount instead, saving a Tier 3 spell slot, and we'll pay him half the money for the scroll." Frost Sword's thinking was very clear, anyway, Zhao Xu would leave a Tier 3 spell slot as agreed for emergencies. Instead of wasting it on a mount, it's better to have them save a scroll. After all, if it's really urgent, the scrolls he saves could also come in handy.

At this time, Chen Nu also walked up to Zhao Xu's side and repeated what he had just said to him.

"Okay," Zhao Xu replied quickly.

However, he had already started thinking in his mind.

The people present did not react, but Zhao Xu himself used the Three Rings spell to combine his own two-ring spell.

On the other hand, he was also trying to roughly determine the direction.

Chen Nu and he had revealed the key information three days ago, and Zhao Xu immediately drew a rough map of the direction and speed of their progress in his mind.

He quickly filtered out a few possible lake surfaces.

Looking at Chen Nu, who had completed the handover with a happy heart and was about to leave to report, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a guilty conscience for deceiving an honest person.

The "Guardian" guild could make a certain name for itself in the future, and even the early Frost Sword faction could gather some well-known players. The team's atmosphere and discipline were not bad.

At least, the wandering player who was responsible for monitoring the outer circle was still very cautious and vigilant, without participating in the conversation with the players who were resting in the inner circle.

"Ah, have you all cast your votes?" someone asked.

"We've cast our votes for Dong Cheng Ling," a female mage said proudly.

"Ha, how can a 5-level player not be her?" someone replied.

"You're saying that's just nonsense," a wandering player said, interrupting. "Recently, there have been several 5-level players who have jumped levels, and it's not just East City Ling who is one of them. The forum is still trying to figure out who the others are. I'm sure one of them is East City Ling."

Just then, a few people who were joking suddenly fell silent.

However, Chen Nu spoke up, saying, "We don't need to guess. One of the 3-level mages is definitely Ling Feng from Floating City."
After two months, even those who live in the underground city of Mistral have heard of that female mage's reputation. So, even if there is no evidence to prove that the opponent is a 3rd-level mage, it doesn't stop them from completely believing it. "Hey, she's only a 3rd-level mage, and I don't know how she managed to become a 5th-level mage." Another player joked on the forum, poking fun at the daily routine. For a moment, everyone thought about themselves, who are only 1-2 levels high, and felt a bit uncomfortable.

As the "Guardian" guild team continued their journey, they maintained a steady pace. It wasn't until they approached a river about 7-8 meters wide that Frost Sword took out his special danger map and shouted, "Be careful, everyone! Scouting ahead, as there are many fierce beasts that come to drink water here!"

Upon hearing the order, the entire guild team suddenly became alert, entering a state of high alert. In Arthur, low-level players often win by being the first to strike.

Generally, players with weak defenses and low HP often find themselves on the losing end. Sometimes, whoever spots the enemy first gets to fire the first shot, gaining an advantage and establishing a significant lead.

"Be careful, as her 'Snowy' scouting skill with a level of 8 and attribute added only adds up to a value of 8. If she makes a mistake, we'll have to rely on everyone else." A nearby priest reminded everyone to be more cautious.
Here is the translation:

So, if the enemy's scouting skills are increased to a point where they can crush the "snow" (an ability) by 20 levels, reaching 28 levels, it's basically a done deal that they will scout out their opponents first.

Unless the challenge level is over 10-15 levels or even legendary, most monsters will not have a scouting level of 28.

Similarly, players will not be able to increase their scouting level by more than one level with their attributes, and can only upgrade their skills by 1 level at a time.

However, magic can often break the impossible.

Zhao Xu felt that something was off, and had a feeling of unease in his heart.

He thought for a moment, then asked Frost Sword, "May I cast a spell to increase scouting skills?"

Frost Sword laughed, "Why not? My sister 'Snow' is our guild's highest scout. You can cast the spell on her first, but ultimately the decision is yours, Mr. Wild Wind."

The person referred to by Frost Sword, Snow, looked over at Zhao Xu with hesitation, wondering whether to speak up.

If the opponent only increased their scouting skills by a level or two, Snow would advise against using the spell, as she believed in her own performance.

However, Zhao Xu had a mysterious smile on his face, "It's fine, this is a spell that everyone can enjoy, and the more people there are, the better the effect."

As Zhao Xu rode on his shadowy mount, he began to cast the spell, "Scouting Net", which he had previously used in the Mysterious Forest to increase the scouting skills of everyone.

Suddenly, all players in the Watcher's Guild received a notification that left them feeling stunned.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Haha, this game is buggy again, I wonder how many levels I gained? It's exaggerated even without the zero. The barbarian in our team laughed loudly.

"Idiot, look at your scouting effect around you."
"It seems we know nothing about the world of magic."
Everyone's attention was already focused on the dynamic prompt bar—
'[Adventurer XX, you have obtained the "Cyclone" spell buff from the mage. Your scouting and listening skills have increased by 80 levels.'"
