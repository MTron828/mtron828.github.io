Chapter 690: Trap Sequence

When faced with a problem, ask for a spell.
This may not be the usual solution used by Arthurians, but it is undoubtedly the first choice of Zhao Xū for someone of his stature and family background, who doesn't bother with the intricacies of spellcasting.
Both the two constructs can strictly destroy him within one round, with additional damage transfer.
Even legendary warriors wouldn't dare to take a step forward.
The swirling dark light transmission portal in front of him, which would be absurd to claim that there are no hidden mechanisms inside, requires Zhao Xū to write his name in reverse using the Arthurian language.
He has doubts in his heart.
A simple second secret room, yet it requires the use of a transmission portal to reach it?
It's no wonder that he didn't feel much area tremor at the beginning, and there was no need to recreate a testing space for him.
It seems that the "lively pit" set up the testing site, which has completely disconnected and blocked the possibility of taking a shortcut.
"Analyze the transmission portal!"
Zhao Xū immediately casts this three-ring spell, and his eyes are filled with a conical light that spreads 20 meters around him.
Luckily, this spell does not require resistance and is not affected by magical immunity.
Zhao Xū immediately uses the spell to analyze the information of the transmission portal in front of him.
Originally, the spell's power could be used to search and scan the area for the presence of a transmission portal, and he naturally skipped this step, recalling the characteristics of the transmission portal in front of him, such as the opening password, starting conditions, and single or dual direction...
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the information about unpredictable teleportation, random location teleportation, limited biological teleportation, and abnormal teleportation, it's somewhat vague.

Hmm?

It wasn't until the last feature information popped up that Zhao Xu gazed at the crystal lens and small mirror in his hand, which served as a tool for casting spells, and couldn't help but think.

Is it really a malfunctioning teleportation gate?

He could definitely use it, but he'd have to take a risk.

But this is really petty, playing tricks in a place like this.

He wondered if he had ever learned the art of making teleportation gates from someone.

He could even simulate the making of a teleportation gate using his latent abilities right now, and it wouldn't be difficult to repair it. It's just a matter of hurrying.

However, after Zhao Xu searched for information about the malfunction of teleportation gates in the dimensional plane, he furrowed his brow.

Malfunctioning teleportation gates, in essence, cannot be artificially created.

The malfunction of teleportation gates is generally caused by the degradation of magic over hundreds of years and the impact of magic.

Many ancient magic items that have been passed down through the ages have undergone mutations, and teleportation gates are no exception.

It's just that a teleportation gate with a history of only a few hundred years is not likely to malfunction.

Not to mention the secret storage methods of King Ernest, the guardian of the mysterious realm, which are even more professional and perfect.

After thinking it over, Zhao Xu shook his head and continued to search for information on the types of malfunctioning teleportation gates.

Initially, he hadn't thought about the problem of malfunction that would occur a hundred years later when he was making a teleportation gate to connect the Star City to the Wilderness of Death.

So he could only rely on his "knowledge" skill to help.

"Whoosh!" Suddenly, a list of malfunctioning teleportation gates appeared before his eyes, clearly listing various types of malfunctioning teleportation gates.

Normal startup, teleportation error location.
Here is the translation of the text:

If not activated, it will release a massive energy shockwave, similar to a fatal spell.

If not activated, it's as if it has been pushed away by a 17th-level caster's "Mind Control" effect.

Absorbing the energy will cause the magical items to malfunction, rendering them ineffective for several turns, or even permanently.

As Zhao Xu gazed at the over a dozen magical items he was wearing, each one carefully selected by him. If the energy is truly absorbed, he'll be devastated.

This is an unbearable burden for anyone's life!

These magical items are priceless, and even if one of them is put out into the public, they're worthless. He's willing to pay 20,000 gold coins to pray for the magic items to return to their original state.

However, the malfunctioning portal still has a chance to "normally start" up.

But true mages never gamble on "probability".

Zhao Xu directly casts the one-ring spell "Stabilize Portal".

This spell is similar to the "Activate City" spell, but it's not listed in any profession catalog. It's only listed in the "Portal" domain, which is exclusive to priests who have faith in gods related to "roads" and "travel".

Just like when Zhao Xu chose "Magic" (incantation prefix), "Planning" (spell delay), and "Knowledge" (devoutness) as his 1st-level priest, he has access to this spell because his scholar has no limits. As long as a priest uses the "Record Scroll" to record divine spells, the recorded spell becomes part of the scholar's learning scope.
As the magical light scattering away from the portal, the mysterious and turbulent black light emanating from it gradually stabilized, as if the original wildness had been reined in.

Zhao Xu then stepped forward, just as he had finished analyzing the portal with his "triple-ring" technique, allowing him to see the scene outside the portal.

However, this spell required concentrated attention, and once he lost focus, its effect was lost.

He continued to take out a glass-like eyeball from his backpack, gently crushing it and scattering the fragments on the portal.

"Observation Portal!"
The third spell in the sequence, "Observation Portal" (four-ring)!
After the spell's energy was released, the originally black light waves on the side facing Zhao Xu gradually became transparent.

It was as if an instant mirror appeared, displaying a larger, deeper, and quieter dark room before Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu, like a voyeur, pressed his face against the energy mirror, gazing at every detail from different angles.

Unfortunately, this spell could not transmit the spell's effects across, otherwise Zhao Xu could have used it to cast a few more detection-type spells.

But to his surprise, there was nothing but a blank space?

Zhao Xu thought to himself.

My own secret room, at least had two small, unkillable stone statues and a lamp on the wall.

That activated pit was not very artistic, and the scene was also of very rough craftsmanship, directly copying and pasting like some old domestic animations, with all the trees and clouds copied from the same plate.

Therefore, the "objects" that could appear had the most direct indications.

But what about the next destination? There was nothing?
Here is the translation of the text:

Unfortunately, he hadn't reached level 11 yet, otherwise he could have utilized the "Teleportation Portal" spell, "Change Destination", and directly change the destination of the only teleportation item to the outside world, avoiding the toxic air in this hidden chamber.

Muttering to himself, Zhao Xuan also stood up, without saying a word, he stretched his leg and stepped into the teleportation portal.

As the space-time distortion occurred, the high-ceilinged room suddenly flashed with light, condensed into a whirlpool, and Zhao Xuan, like a paratrooper, dropped down from five meters above.

Zhao Xuan immediately controlled his flight ability, trying to maintain his balance.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you are affected by the "Earth Binding" effect, and cannot fly here.】

In an instant, this harsh reminder appeared, and Zhao Xuan's expression changed. He then activated his "Feather Drop" spell.

Only by struggling, he managed to control the speed of his descent, avoiding a fatal fall.

After steadying himself, Zhao Xuan immediately activated his "Secret Vision" and various detection methods, surveying the space around him, which was roughly the size of a standard basketball court.

There was nothing unusual.

Zhao Xuan was puzzled; he had no psychological shadows, let alone now that he possessed magic.

He would be afraid of ghosts?
Ghosts would be afraid of him.

Just for an instant, Zhao Xuan's eyebrows shot up.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, your immune ability, immunity to toxins, was successful.】

Poison?
Where did the poison come from?

However, Zhao Xuan reacted quickly.

After getting annoyed with himself for being a bit dense, Zhao Xuan took a deep breath and silently took out the seven-colored spindle-shaped Ayn stone from his backpack and let it hover above his head.

Initially, Zhao Xuan had removed the Ayn stone from the top of his head to go on an adventure with his team. However, in this region, it was as if he was writing "I have a magical item" on his forehead.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unbeknownst to him, he wasn't immune to the toxin, and he almost got caught off guard.

He was suddenly poisoned in the air!

Zhao Xu couldn't help but lower his evaluation of that activated cave.

To counter him, he even resorted to the most despicable methods.

Although Zhao Xu had already developed immunity to the toxin, he was still affected by the respiratory toxic gas and felt uneasy in his mind.

Zhao Xu still honestly took out the "Einhorn Stone" to gain the power to breathe freely.

At the same time, he also carefully glanced at his character panel and rechecked everything.

The just-finished secret room tested his attack skills and damage output.

But what would this room test next?

The empty surroundings looked like there was no active trigger, but it seemed to be actively attacking him.

Suddenly, a faint, icy voice echoed through the void—

"Through the requirements: survive through 20 levels."
"Countdown starts."
"5."
"4."
"..."
"1."

Zhao Xu heard the sound of a mechanism starting up and turned his head sharply.

He saw three arrows with icy glows flying towards him, their green arrowheads already tainted with toxins.

However, he had the "Friendly Flame" ability to deflect remote attacks, and Zhao Xu directly ignored it, turning his head to gaze at the strange sound coming from behind.

In the blind spot of his line of sight, six throwing stars flew towards him.

And...

Zhao Xu's Turtle Vision allowed him to notice an unusual phenomenon above, a row of toxin-tipped needles with dark green blood staining them descending from the top.

Multiple angles, simultaneous attacks!

In this instant, Zhao Xu had already figured it out.

From the time that activated cave appeared, he had been restricted from using teleportation abilities, naturally including all movement abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the tree dies, but people live; ordinary soldiers are not reliant on skills to dodge attacks from powerful monsters. Zhao Xu didn't say a word before suddenly casting the unique skill "Step on the Ground" granted by the Patroller Ring on himself.

【Adventurer Summer, you are affected by the "Step on the Ground" spell, and your balance, climbing, jumping, and rolling checks gain a +10 ability bonus.】

After casting the spell, Zhao Xu hastily rushed to another empty area, moving as swiftly as a flash of light, earning the nickname of "Surprised Falcon".

Others were still bewildered and dodging, but Zhao Xu had already fully understood the situation.

The three attacks just encountered were actually the most ordinary level 1 challenge, namely the basic arrow trap, poison dart trap, and poison needle trap.

This was exactly the first stage.

Zhao Xu, standing in this small room, had clearly triggered the trap, which is why the three traps targeted him directly.

Moreover, traps usually require one to reach a specific location to trigger them, but these traps automatically targeted him as soon as he entered the room.

This also revealed that these traps were not originally ordinary traps, but rather had a high intensity.

However, Zhao Xu, relying on the effects of his Stellar Cloak and his own exceptional defense abilities, still didn't dare to be careless. After thinking, he decided to prioritize evasion, and only if he couldn't evade, he would use brute force.

He remembered that there were still many level 1 traps ahead, and his thoughts had just begun to emerge...

As he thought, Zhao Xu suddenly noticed a slow-growing shadow above him...

A massive rock appeared in the sky, falling towards him.

Zhao Xu didn't panic, jumping to the side with a single step...

Just then...
Here is the translation:

The next landing point is surrounded by a hail of arrows that come flying in from all directions.

A trap of arrows!

At the same time, several scythes also appear, bound by iron chains, and slash out a semicircular arc, cutting across and coming at us.

A scythe trap!

It's as if I can hear the mocking tone in Zhao Xu's heart, and one by one, the traps are marching forward, intending to show off their existence.

But Zhao Xu hasn't had the chance to mock them yet.

The traps come one after another: a fake pit trap, a deep pit trap, a flying dart trap, an iron gate trap, a steel wire corridor trap, a stone trap, and a sword wall trap. Each one is a relentless attack with no repetition.

I've never seen Zhao Xu take on so many underground traps before. This time, he finally remembers his lesson after 10 rounds.

But what's even more astonishing is that these traps all have a reset function. After a round, the giant stones, poison needles, and flying darts all disappear, only to reappear from thin air.

Zhao Xu has already endured 10 rounds of traps in the first level.

But he still hasn't seen the slightest hint of an end.

Just now, the voice from thin air was so polite, saying that he could pass after 20 rounds.

But now, Zhao Xu is wondering when the first level will finally end!

Zhao Xu thought to himself, his gaze sweeping across the plain and unremarkable walls.

Can he really break through? What's with this "dispel curse" that's just a joke?
