Chapter 565: The Half-Beast with Weak Intelligence

For the first time in the underground Death God Temple, Zhao Xu easily obtained the legendary artifact, Lark's, this time. However, he only used it once to defeat the "Deep Dungeon Refiner" and then didn't use it again, as he was afraid of drawing attention. At the time, Zhao Xu's strength was too weak, and he couldn't even use illusions.

As soon as the artifact transformed, it would cause a huge commotion, so Zhao Xu couldn't use it unless he had a mindset of wiping out everything. Later, when he went to obtain the "Sacred Breath", he only managed to break through two stone doors, and the Sacred Breath ascended to the sky, and he lost it again.

These experiences made Zhao Xu believe he was no longer blessed with an artifact.

Who would have thought that the "Universal Book of Law" that could only be used for a few minutes would become a fixed item, allowing him to use it for a long time. With the help of the Universal Book of Law, Zhao Xu's strength increased.

The Universal Book of Law recorded 32 spells, which were normally distributed, with no more than three or two rings. However, under Zhao Xu's selection, he could easily create 32 powerful spells with five or more rings. As a mage and a priest, he could use these spells four times.

After deciding on the composition of the Universal Book of Law's spells, Zhao Xu summoned a normal mount and began his search for the "Seed" on his own. This time, he wanted to choose people for himself, which was related to the big plan involving the "Catastrophe of the Saint" mentioned by Anzheni.

Note: I'll make sure to keep my responses concise and clear, without any unnecessary details or repetitions.
For Zhao Xu, finding people is easy, but the difficult part is "judging" whether they are suitable, which puts his integrity and emotional intelligence to the test.

Soon, Zhao Xu approached a place where travelers gathered, guided by a bright beam of light that flashed a few times. However, his expression turned solemn as he got closer.

It had only been a day since he crossed over, and the earthlings in this area were already using makeshift tools made of tree branches to dig up wild vegetables. It was instinctual to show a strong desire to survive, and Zhao Xu could imagine how many civilians were doing the same thing around him. At the moment when the transmission screen descended upon the earth.

All non-human materials on earth were unable to be transmitted synchronously, so most people did not wear their clothes at the time. Instead, they were automatically replaced with plain white robes by the gods in an instant. Only players could retain their original equipment and wear it to transmit to Arthur.

This was also the most obvious difference between players and earthlings at this moment. Although Zhao Xu was wearing a cloak and robe, many people in this area did not recognize each other, and the few people digging up wild vegetables just thought he was an adventurer who had just returned from an outing and did not pay much attention to him.

As Zhao Xu entered, he had already set up a simple camp with branches and was responsible for guarding it. The person in charge stopped him and asked, "Who are you?"

"I just returned from exploring the nearby area yesterday," Zhao Xu replied.

"Oh," the two people at the gate said, without saying much more. Their duty was to prevent wild beasts from approaching the camp.

At this time, Zhao Xu also saw that not far away, a group of civilians carrying simple wooden spears were patrolling along the fence, observing whether any wild rabbits had collided with the fence's thorns and, in passing, repairing any holes.

In the desperate situation, after the initial chaos, everyone was looking for a way to survive.

Especially when there were players or former authorities in a certain area, they could rely on their own abilities and prestige to become leaders and stabilize the crowd.

"Give me back this double-handed giant sword, Bao Tong," said a battle-hardened warrior who had suddenly appeared, looking at the patrol team's young man.

This young and thin man called Bao Tong was holding a double-handed giant sword, but his grip was awkward, and the sword looked like it had been obtained from a player.

"Chapter Yao Yu, you gave this giant sword to me yesterday, why are you asking for it back now?" Chapter Yao Yu, with a darkened face, seemed anxious.

"It's not that I didn't see it coming. After watching you guys gather yesterday, you said we needed weapons for patrol. I only gave it to you because of your dad's face. Now, what do you think our situation is like now? Can we still go back to Earth? Why do I have to flatter you? I think this giant sword is more effective in my hands."

"Yes," a female student stood behind the warrior, scowling, "I asked my boyfriend, and this sword belongs to the Blacksmith for 50 gold coins. Do you know how much it can be exchanged for?"

"That can be offset by a single word from your dad," Chapter Yao Yu said angrily and hastily, "And besides, as a civilian, you have no expertise or professional skills to master this kind of 'military equipment'."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it that you don't master even simple weapons, and you're thinking of flying to military-grade weapons?" The girlfriend of the warrior also mocked him, saying, "You're really looking down on people with a dog's eyes."

The young man, Bo Tong, was also somewhat annoyed and his hands started shaking.

Zhao Xu, who had just heard his Chinese name, couldn't help but laugh out loud, and his habit of using his real name in Arthur's world was still evident.

After the players crossed over, many of them recovered their real names and used their original game names as handles.

As for this conflict, it was clear that the newly crossed-over player was trying to curry favor with their superior or leader by presenting their weapon.

However, after a day, the people from Earth began to realize the gap between "players" and "civilians".

The gap in physical quality and professional skills between the two was enormous.

Instantly, a distinction in status was formed.

Using a single weapon, even an unusual one like the broken magic spear or double-headed handcuffs, as long as you can wield it, you can use it. However, if you want to fight with it, it's very challenging.

If you don't reach the level of mastery, forcing a fight will not unleash your true strength, according to statistical experience, which can weaken the attack power by about 4 levels.

Zhao Xu's becoming a priest was a significant milestone, as he mastered "all simple weapons". At the time, it even surprised Li An, almost making him think he was a war god.

Now, the civilians on Earth want to complete these trainings, which is not as easy as the players who have experienced it for a few days and then rely on the game's auxiliary system to automatically complete it.

For the civilians on Earth to master these abilities, it's not just a matter of putting in the effort day and night for a few years, but it's actually a process that requires years of dedication.

"Don't talk to him anymore, just take it back directly," the warrior's girlfriend advised.

"Okay."

In an instant, the warrior player took a leap and rushed towards him, with his muscular body and enhanced strength, his entire body like a tiger pouncing on prey. Before his figure appeared, the wind arrived.

"Slap." The sound of a sword hitting the ground echoed through the air, as the 8-pound two-handed giant sword was snatched back by the warrior with his bare hands.

After crossing over, all players below Zhao Xu, including himself, gained the "battle awareness" and "magical knowledge" that had been unclear in the game, and quickly grasped these abilities and put them into practice.

As for the mage profession, it was difficult to understand the knowledge system forcibly implanted in the brain, and it would take at least a year or half a year to upgrade again.

"You still don't understand, there's a huge gap in battle awareness between civilians and players like us," said the warrior player, looking at the young man lying on the ground who had been easily defeated by him.

"I'm a patrol team, you stole my weapon, and I'll report you to the authorities," the young man shouted angrily, only to realize that none of his companions were willing to help him.

"You see, your companions also understand," the woman said coldly. "As for who's on top, even after some time has passed, it's hard to say."

Although the woman's words were sharp and had a condescending tone, no one in the scene had any doubts.

It was only a day later that they began to notice the strange attitude of the people in the camp towards the players.
Here is the translation of the text:

The former high-and-mighty goddess's backup player suddenly realized that the originally unattainable goddess was also someone who would eventually show affection.

Such a stark contrast in circumstances played out on this barren land every day.

"Excuse me, do you know a little girl named 'Li Luoyu'?" Zhao Xu suddenly raised his hand and asked.

As someone who had already become a mage, he could only see the pulse-like fluctuations of the magical aura, which was interrupted and intermittent.

"So, what do you want with her?" The warrior player exclaimed in surprise.

However, Zhao Xu's gaze made him feel uneasy, and he subtly retreated, revealing a cautious attitude. His girlfriend, who was standing behind him, also remained silent.

Chao Yao Yu was clear about what was on top of the other person's head, and it wasn't something that could be taken lightly, nor was it something that could be obtained with wealth or power.

"I'm here on a mission to find her," Zhao Xu said with a warm smile, already thinking about preparing the "Charm Human" spell in his heart.

When he heard this, Chao Yao Yu's expression relaxed slightly, and he hesitated slightly, saying, "She's with her brother now."

Zhao Xu's keen intuition immediately sensed something was off, and he asked, "What's going on?"

"No, it's just... unfortunate," Chao Yao Yu said with an awkward expression, "Her brother was also my comrade and a player, initially choosing the half-orc warrior."

"Then, by the way, he started with 8 intelligence and is now at 6," Chao Yao Yu added.
Here is the translation:

In response to this, Zhao Xu could only nod silently.

Compared to the 4-sagely raptors, what's better about the 8-sagely warriors, such as the human-horse hybrids, is nothing like that.

It's at the same level as the giant demons, man-eating demons, and hellhounds.

From a human perspective, it belongs to the category of "feeble-minded" people who can be disabled.

"That's to say, can you take me to her? I'm not sure if I can help her brother," Zhao Xu said.
