Chapter 262: Collective Magic

Zhang Qi gazed at the frost giant in front of them, unable to help but fall into a state of stupor, mesmerized by the giant's 5-meter height, even in the midst of the blizzard. The frost giant's white skin, with blue-ish hair and eyes, was dressed in armor, with a massive animal hide wrapped around it. Some of the frost giants wore helmets adorned with animal horns and feathers.

The adult frost giants, weighing over a ton, crushed the snow beneath their feet, causing the recent boulders to rain down from above. The giant tribe consisted of frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and mountain giants, with stone throwing being a natural talent of the giant tribe. Frost giants were particularly fond of using stone projectiles as a long-range attack method.

As the frost giants finished throwing the stones, they charged towards the players. Behind them, the pack of winter wolves was larger than the day before, with no specific target in mind, but instead, they were intent on killing all the players.

"These are the giants mentioned in the bottom deck as having a challenge level above 10 levels?" Zhang Qi exclaimed in awe.

Although this was his second encounter with the giant tribe after meeting the evil magic giant, he was still intimidated by the giants' towering physique.

"No, the few fire giants are from the nearby hot spring region, while these numerous frost giants are all from the mountain range," Cui Luo replied.

"What did the mine owners provide these giants with in terms of weapons?" Zhang Qi thought, looking at the enormous, razor-sharp weapons.

"It's too frightening."
Here is the translation of the text:

As countless players saw these terrifying giants, they all felt a sense of fear, and in their two months of leveling up, they had not even approached the distant Ice Mountain Range, let alone encountered these giant tribes. Most of the battles were with monsters of similar or smaller sizes, and even with prior preparation, they couldn't help but sigh in frustration. "Kill!" The barbarian player in the front row shouted, and immediately entered a frenzied state. This one-time daily profession skill, which was used on the spot, granted them a 4-point boost to strength and vitality, directly increasing their combat power. However, the wolves over 2 meters tall had already pounced over, hunting in packs and snow-covered hunting grounds, refusing to spare their enemies. They often worked together with evil frost giants to hunt, serving as scouts and trackers for their enemies. The lead wolves led the charge, spewing out a mist of freezing cold air, which directly knocked down several warriors who had failed to dodge the attack and killed them on the spot. After using their mist-attack, the wolves entered a period of inactivity, unable to spit out another blast immediately. However, their agility remained agile, allowing them to knock down several warriors who were trying to attack with long spears, and then triggered their entangling ability. The warrior who had invested in strength and vitality was immediately knocked to the ground, completely suppressed. At this time, Zhang Qi was about to launch an attack on the incoming wolves, but discovered that several frost giants had already broken through. The frost giants wielded massive giant axes, hacking at the nearest barbarian player with a powerful blow that cut through the battlefield.

The gruesome scene shocked the female players who were playing with her, causing them to scream and lose control of their blessing spells, resulting in the loss of their spell slots. The battlefield was replaying a similar scenario repeatedly.

Although the number of frost giants and their deployment was not large compared to the players, even a single frost giant could pose a significant threat to over ten 1st-level players, let alone the numerous ones that were deployed.

As the barbarian Du Nan stood in front, he let out a fierce roar and swung his giant sword at the frost giant's waist.

However, he barely managed to aim for the weak spot on the giant's armor, only to have his sword blocked by the giant's skin, which was just as hard as the armor. It was as if the giant's skin was even harder than the armor.

Zhang Qi knew that Du Nan had forgotten the giant's data and quickly shouted, "Dodge, the giant has a natural armor with 9 levels of effectiveness, stronger than the entire body armor!"

The frost giant, which was blocking the attack, grinned with a wicked smile and swung its giant axe at Du Nan.

Du Nan, who had been distracted, failed to dodge the attack and was struck down on the spot. Luckily, he had a special ability that increased his HP by 4 when he reached level 2 as a barbarian, and he narrowly avoided death.

In an instant, Zhang Qi and several other warriors rushed over, but the frost giant did not stop its attack and launched a powerful "Great Slicing Cut" blow, straight at Zhang Qi and the others.

The warriors who rushed over were knocked down, with half of them falling. Two of them managed to dodge the attack.

Meanwhile, the hunter in the distance shot arrows at the giant, but they were all blocked by the giant's armor.

One tense mage finally completed a spell and shouted, "Seven-color Spray!"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As soon as he grasped his hand, a streak of colorful and dazzling light burst forth, directly hitting the frost giant's body. Although the giant was vulnerable to mental manipulation, it didn't seem to be affected by the spell. "Even if you succeed, you can only intimidate them for 1 round," Feng Ge shouted hurriedly to the mage to stop him.

However, a warrior player behind the giant, holding a tower shield, was unexpectedly influenced by the "rainbow beam" and fell to the ground. The player, in a helpless state, was bitten by a winter wolf on the neck and launched a fatal attack.

The entire plain was filled with the cries of the wounded. No one expected the Mining Association, which had been exhausted, to suddenly play its final card and send its strongest ally, the giant tribe, to turn the tide of the battle. Not even the guards of the Star Town were sent out to avoid friendly fire.

The frost giants received orders to slaughter all hostile forces on this land. Slowly, players who had revived began to return to the battlefield.

The revived players, their eyes red with fury and their teeth bared, charged towards the battlefield. Meanwhile, the frost giants, with their tall and muscular bodies, attacked the players with their long arms, their movements extremely agile and fearless. Even with weapons, they still launched special tearing attacks against the players. Many players' bodies were torn apart, causing massive damage.

Additionally, these giants had regenerative abilities, and even if their arms were cut off by players, they would regenerate after a few minutes.
Here is the translation of the text:

The battlefield of the entire Starfall Lake slowly turned into a meat grinder, and the priests quickly used up their spell slots and charged forward with their hammers, with female priests included. For everyone, leaving a wound on these monsters' bodies was a worthy achievement.

Originally, Zhao Xu had planned to take a fierce blow, but after encountering these frost giants, he had become enraged and was willing to sacrifice himself for a wound.

As Zhang Qi watched Feng Ge being knocked down by the giant hunter with a battle-axe, he went berserk and continued to fight forward despite his severe injuries.

The leaders of the alliance forces behind the battlefield saw this scene and knew that the situation was already lost.

It was clear that the traitors in the group had leaked the battle plan to the Starfall Lake Mining Association, which had put them in a precarious situation. As a result, the high-ranking officials of the Mining Association had made a decision to reveal their trump card and trade it with the players' lives.

However, everyone was puzzled about whether this was worth it.

The evil giant tribe connected to the Ice Mountain Range was not just a battle, and the cost was completely different. The Mining Association had wanted to conceal the past, but it was not that easy.

"Master, it's over. The players will be crushed if we continue," Lakshmi said as she looked at the scene.

It was difficult for players to withstand the frost giants' attacks, and the level gap between them and the frost giant army was enormous, making it impossible to compensate with numbers alone.

Zhao Xu, who was observing from the side, remained calm and looked at the scene before him. When he submitted the battle plan yesterday, he had already taken this scenario into consideration.

"It's time to end this battle," Zhao Xu said.
As Zhao Xu felt the remaining life energy within him, he suddenly asked, "How many spells can I cast?"

"About 4 or 5, I think," Lacis replied, her tone tinged with hesitation.

Zhao Xu immediately dispelled his invisibility and, with his flight spell still in effect, flew towards the battlefield.

The players who had been shouting suddenly fell silent, and the frost giants engaged in battle looked up at the sky in surprise - a level 5 mage with the number 5 embroidered on his cloak was flying through the air.

"Some players exclaimed, "That's the 4-star 'Stellar Reflection'!"

"It's too late now; he can't affect the outcome," more players lamented, their spirits crushed. Perhaps they had given up all their revive stones, which was the only thing keeping them going.

As Zhao Xu flew through the air, the wind and snow made it impossible for the players on the ground to see his movements, let alone whether he was casting spells.

He gazed wistfully at the town of Starfall, where he had lived for a long time, and then looked down at the players.

Some of them, whom he had met in his previous life, were familiar faces, and he had visited them intentionally.

However, Zhao Xu's focus was now on his spells, and he slowly began to cast a spell, saying, "Miracle: I want the area of effect for my next spell to be the plain in front of Starfall Lake."

Suddenly, he felt his life energy being drained from his body.

As Zhao Xu flew through the air, he silently began to cast spells as well.

Unexpectedly, the miracle spell supported Zhao Xu, allowing him to cast over ten group spells or area-of-effect spells from start to finish.

Under the influence of the miracle spell, the area of effect of these spells expanded from the original 3 meters to 1,000 meters or more, covering the entire battlefield.

At this time, countless players on the battlefield stared in amazement at their character cards and dynamic bars, with multiple area tips popping up, almost as if a major event had occurred. The result was that they directly gained the effects of over ten spells.

Especially after the last tip, players became self-taught, relying on their own willpower to control the situation.

In no time, the entire Star Lake region was filled with players and Zhao Xu alike, directly levitating and turning this battle into a historic air battle.

It was also under the influence of these spells that players began to become the most powerful entities in the Star Lake region.
