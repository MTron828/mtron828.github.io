Chapter 411 Account Leakage
When Zhao Xu walked onto the stone bridge like a single log bridge, he never thought that the first enemy he would encounter would be a golem.
The golem is a construct created by a spellcaster who has mastered the corresponding spell through a certain process.
They are essentially ruthless killing machines, with no emotions and cannot be angered.
At the same time, they do not think or execute complex battle plans, only continuously carrying out commands from their master.
The key ability common to golems is their immunity to magic, being able to ignore any spells that require resistance.
Although Zhao Xu did not understand why the weapons created by spellcasters would target the spellcasters themselves.
At the same time, because golems have the characteristics of constructs, they also have a series of corresponding immune characteristics of constructs, such as immunity to psychological influence, instant death, sleep, paralysis, and so on, which are roughly similar to undead creatures.
In addition to being able to adapt to various harsh environments, they are often placed as guardians in some tombs, making them formidable enemies for adventurers.
The clay golem in front of them is completely a humanoid creature made of clay, standing half a meter taller than Zhao Xu when it stands up.
Its broad chest is connected to powerful arms through large muscle joints, and it suddenly swung its arms towards Zhao Xu with a powerful punch, accompanied by a whistling sound.
However, Vivian had already moved. For the slow-moving clay golem, her speed was even faster, and she also raised her own floating shield.

The sixth-ring spell Disjunction can cause a slow effect and deal 1-12 damage.
The eighth-ring spell Earthquake can immobilize the target and deal 5-50 damage.
At this critical moment, Zhao Xu saw the feedback from these messages and wanted to laugh out loud.
If he could cast these spells, there would be no need to use knowledge skills to deal with a small golem.
But thinking back, in this place where flying was not allowed, Zhao Xu didn't dare to cause trouble on the ground, fearing that he might even trap himself.
And other spells, unless they do not require resistance, cannot affect the golem.
The golem is said to be a mage killer, but not quite, not even close.
Especially the clay golem in front of him is only a level 10 challenge.
But once they scale up, they can unleash the ability to overwhelm the opponent, especially for low-level mages facing construct bodies immune to magic, it's really tricky.
While spells are ineffective, these clay golems have a natural armor of 14, at least 20 levels of defense. Not to mention their ability to reduce damage by 10 points, which can only be overcome by adamantine and bludgeoning attacks.
However, just as the clay golem was about to unleash its powerful force towards Zhao Xu again, he gently used his dimensional gloves to retrieve the wand.
In an instant, a black jade-like staff reappeared in front of him - the Staff of Strength Runes.
The simple staff was surrounded by two spells that had been released on it.
Advanced extraordinary strike!
The base damage of the weapon is increased from 3 points to 20 points.
Self-enhancement of magical weapons!
Adding the 'fearless' enchantment ability.

Seeing the big explosion near the alliance, it made him itch inside, and he couldn't wait to go online and organize his teammates for the expedition. At this time, the chat in the class Arthur group also started to heat up, mostly discussing the live exposé posts on the forum after waking up today. Just then, Zhang Qigang switched to the desktop and found that his gaming forum app suddenly received a new notification, telling him that the hottest post of the day had changed hands. Zhang Qigang couldn't help but wonder, the second hottest post was also about the big explosion, but it was still far behind, how did it suddenly catch up? As for the remaining posts, not to mention, the hottest post had already established a solid position for itself, and most of the other exposé posts were being updated in real time under that post. Could it be a new discovery? Zhang Qigang immediately switched back to the forum, and his gaze instantly fell on the newest hottest post of the day— "Shocking! The IP address range of Dongcheng Ling is actually from a certain university!" Zhang Qigang's electric toothbrush in his hand fell directly on the sink without him knowing. Even with a mouth full of toothpaste foam, he couldn't help but mutter to himself. The legendary god Dongcheng Ling is actually their classmate?
