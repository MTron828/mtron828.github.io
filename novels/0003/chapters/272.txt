Chapter 273: Forum Dispute

When Zhao Xu went offline, it was already close to 10pm.

When Lakis pointed to something, he immediately reacted to the ability of that vial.

The caster has many methods to consume their own level, especially some creations consume their own life force, which is extremely large.

The restoration spell can only recover negative levels caused by monsters and cannot recover losses due to creations.

Moreover, the "Thought Vial" can also be used to store thoughts, such as Zhao Xu can store his friend's name in the vial, so that he will only know that the vial has his friend's name, but not what the name is.

Zhao Xu can also use the vial to store memories, such as his memories before rebirth. In this way, Zhao Xu will only know that he has been reborn, but the specific details of his rebirth will only be stored in the vial.

Regardless of whether it's "thought" or "memory", it can only be stored in five, and once stored, Zhao Xu's mind will completely forget these thoughts and cannot be restored by spell.

Zhao Xu can also use the vial to backup spells, as long as he has prepared the corresponding spells in his mind, he can consume the spell and store it in the vial.

However, the strongest ability of the vial is still the "Locked Level" or "Locked Experience" suggested by Lakis.

As long as Zhao Xu pays a portion of his energy cost, equivalent to the cost of creating a magical item worth around 10,000 gold coins, he can record his current level state into the vial.

Even if he later discovers that his level is lost, he can recover it immediately by touching the vial.
Here is the translation of the text:

Except for some overly used methods, the most common ones are revival techniques. Except for the "Complete Resurrection Technique" that does not lose levels, most other methods will lose levels. These revival techniques can be stored in one's body through the "Temporary Technique" specialized skill, just like how Anzai used the "Temporary Technique" to store the "Shape Transformation" of the Nine Rings in his body.

The stored technique cannot be repeated, so even if the "Resurrection of the Dead" is only at the five-ring level, Zhao Xu will still consider it. Therefore, Zhao Xu has already prepared himself, and when he can cast it, he will use the "Temporary Technique" to construct a revival chain, using the "Complete Resurrection Technique", "Soul Summoning Technique", "Return Protocol", "Final Breath", "Regeneration Technique", "Resurrection Technique", "Death Covenant", "Resurrection of the Dead", and "Cloning Technique" to build his own revival system.

It's also the reason why high-level mages are difficult to kill. At this time, Zhao Xu realized that Zhang Qi was not in his dormitory, and Chen Sijia was not there either.

He took out his phone and saw Zhang Qi's message, which made him understand that everyone was at the cafeteria tonight. Zhao Xu was stunned and also remembered that after the "Fall of Star Lake Battle", Zhang Qi and others had also gathered at the cafeteria.

The players of our school's Arthur Club are over a hundred, and it's impossible to arrange a KTV package or restaurant, so they could only arrange a gathering at the cafeteria. Zhao Xu smiled, recalling that in his previous life, he did not play games and accompanied Zhang Qi from start to finish at this gathering.

On the other hand, in this life, he led the battle to take over half of Star Lake, but unfortunately, he almost missed tonight's gathering.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xiu thought about it, he directly changed his clothes and headed towards the cafeteria next to the dormitory.

When he arrived at the cafeteria, Zhang Qi, who had already had a few drinks and was somewhat intoxicated, hastily waved at Zhao Xiu. Zhao Xiu walked quickly towards him and joined Zhang Qi's table.

Zhang Qi put down the bottle of Qingdao beer in his hand and hugged Zhao Xiu, saying, "Xiu, do you know how happy I am today? We finally won this round!"

As he spoke, he couldn't help but shout loudly, attracting the attention of the people at nearby tables.

At this moment, Zhang Qi's girlfriend, Feng Ge, hurried over to grab his arm and give him a pat on the back.

"How many did you have?" Zhao Xiu asked, looking at the empty beer bottles on the table. Feng Ge could only shrug and tell Zhao Xiu that it was five bottles.

However, Zhao Xiu's attention was quickly diverted to the large TV in the cafeteria, which was playing a video.

Numerous players were seen flying in mid-air amidst the wind and snow, and then launching an attack on the giant people on the ground.

"What's this video?" Zhao Xiu couldn't help but ask curiously.

After finishing the battle earlier, he had taken a shortcut to retrieve the transmission portal and returned to the floating city, using the "transmission technique" to travel.

In the afternoon, he had also spent time learning the "Ring Three Arts" in the "Final Scroll" space, while Zhang Qi and others were occupying the Starfall Town.

By the time Zhao Xiu had just logged off, he hadn't had a chance to check the hot topics on the forum.

"It was probably around evening time," said Cui Lu, who was sitting opposite Zhao Xiu, "and it was also released by the game development team under the name of 'Birth of the Holy Temple'."

Cui Lu and the class monitor, Fang Xue, who was sitting beside him, both had a few cups and their faces had turned slightly red.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the entire cafeteria, players of all ages from Zhao Xu's school, big or small, are excitedly sharing their experiences of today's battle and recalling the past. Just like the "Fall of the Star Lake" battle, there were also video recordings that came out, but back then, the focus was more on the players' sense of desperation in the hopeless battle, where they would directly pick up the weapons and fight to the death.

However, there was no such epic sense of players coming together like this time. Players cannot record or live-stream the game, so they only thought that these scenes were part of the official plan.

Zhao Xu is aware that this is at least partially due to divine intervention, which allowed for multi-area recording and transmission to Earth as a form of "promotional content" for the game. However, this method is expensive, which is why there were few "actual situation" videos of the game in the past.

It wasn't until two months after the game's introduction that players saw the game's battle video.

"I'm just strange," said Fang Xi Yue, "those treasure chests left behind by the mine owners mostly contain weapons, and the treasure is very scarce, and doesn't match the mine owners' statements."

This time, the "Counterattack Alliance" is counting the spoils of war to compensate for the players' losses, and she is also participating as a supervisor.

"It's definitely one or two of the mine owners who took the opportunity to embezzle funds and then fled," said a student.

"It's ridiculous, grandma, don't make me look at it, or I'll kill those bandits," said the game's wild man, Du Nan.

Compared to weapons and equipment, people still prefer to accumulate shiny gold coins in their pockets.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the mastermind behind the massive haul, Zhao Xu's face turned red as he directly grabbed a bottle of beer and took a sip to calm himself down. He had almost stuffed his own dimensional backpack to the brim for that treasure trove.

"What's with the excessive behavior?" Zhang Qi said, his face flushed with intoxication. "I've worked hard for this. It took me a long time to break through the 2nd level. And look, there's still a mountain to climb, and I've jumped to the 5th level directly."

"Ah, it feels like he's the only one who's accomplished this feat," a classmate exclaimed with envy.

"Warriors haven't even reached level 3 yet, and there are hardly any players at this level," someone else said. After a few more sips of beer, the mood in the room became more relaxed, and people started criticizing the account "Star Sky Reflection".

Although they were still impressed, they couldn't help but criticize the account. It was as if they were saying that the opponent's guidance had played a crucial role in their victory.

"Well, drink up," someone said, echoing the speculation on the forum. "It's likely that the blessing we received today is also thanks to the opponent's guidance."

At this point, a classmate from the adjacent table, Jiang Ze, walked over with a beer bottle. Jiang Ze was familiar with Zhao Xu, as they were classmates from the same school. He had seen the video of King Arthur's cavalry charge and had joined the game immediately after.

He had also participated in the battle today and had gathered a lot of firsthand information.
Here is the translation of the text:

On the forum, some people have analyzed that the Magic Goddess Church in Winter City has not taken any concrete actions today, and has been holding meetings instead. Therefore, it is possible that the Magic Goddess's divine blessing may still appear on the battlefield. It's definitely bizarre.

"Could it be that 'Starlight Reflection', the great god, knows the divine being who appeared as the wind?" Crui said to herself.

"I don't know, but 'Starlight Reflection' has already become the hottest topic on the forum, pushing aside the previous great god 'Dong Cheng Lian'."

"In a few days, the forum will be selecting the top 10 players and conducting interviews. Who will become number one is still uncertain."

"Divine beings fighting."

"I'm on 'Starlight Reflection's' side. This time, we were able to turn the tide of the Star Lake battle. As for the opponent's strategy, it must be the key to winning."

"Ha! I'm looking at 'Dong Cheng Lian's' new player guide. I only recognize this goddess."

As the topic shifted to which of these two goddesses deserves to be ranked number one, the discussion began.

As the person involved, Zhao Xu took out his phone and started browsing the hot posts on the forum.

【Is it hard for the 5th-level player "Starlight Reflection" to be number one?】
【I think it's high-level 1, high-level 2 is cheating! The technician, Dong Cheng Lian, is the one who should be number one!】

Zhao Xu looked at the two posts that were fighting each other and suddenly became the hottest two posts on the forum, even surpassing the hot posts about the Star Lake battle today.

He suddenly felt a bit strange, as yesterday's forum wind direction had predicted that the two were the same person. But today's tone has changed.

Zhao Xu could only use his original forum account "Xu" to post a new thread -
Is it possible that these two are the same person?

It was just an instant, and he received a prompt from the forum moderator: "Hello, user 'Xu', because your post lacks formal evidence and only consists of one sentence, it will be marked as a 'water post' and locked."

Zhao Xu looked at his own "evidence", which was actually his alt account "Dong Cheng Ling", and remained silent.
