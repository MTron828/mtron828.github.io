Chapter 446: One Strike Kill

After entering the icy cold water, the three of them used their magical powers to swim down to the bottom of the lake. During this time, Zhao Xu noticed that the lake bottom was covered with a thick layer of frost, and the fish were swimming and hiding from the big fish that were hunting them.

It took almost half an hour to swim down to the bottom of the lake. Zhao Xu and Veve followed An Ti Nuoya, who slowly sank to the muddy bottom of the lake. Zhao Xu used his spiritual sense to communicate with An Ti Nuoya.

Aside from feeling that the bottom of the lake was murky, he couldn't sense anything unusual.

"Not wrong," An Ti Nuoya said, "we'll continue to swim through the muddy bottom of the lake and go down about 10 kilometers. It's almost there."

"It's not something ordinary people can reach," Veve said with a sigh.

"It's true that the tombs of powerful gods who have died can only be found in the starry sky unless they have died in battle. As for those who have true tombs, even if they know the location, it's difficult to approach."

"The 10-kilometer-long lake bottom cliff is not something that can be stopped by ordinary people, but it can stop those who don't know the truth. It's also a kind of protection for them. If they mistakenly enter, they may be enslaved forever."

"So, Teacher, have you been here before?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.
Here is the translation:

"That's definitely it, I can take you to that place, and I'm not entirely sure about it. It's just that the Mersezelin's tomb is under this tomb, and I've confirmed my breathing, so as soon as I'm inside, I'll cast a spell..."

"Will it affect Miss?" Vivian suddenly said tightly.

"Not at all. A dead tomb wouldn't dare to affect me, a legendary mage like me. It would be a legendary mage even stronger than me, not just a tomb spirit."

Anny explained, "The main point is that it warned me, and if I dare to enter it again, it will activate its self-destruct program, directly crashing the entire tomb into the fire elemental plane, rather than letting others benefit from it and obtain the hope of becoming a god. I won't let them get the upper hand in the slightest."

Originally, Vivian was still a bit tense, her eyebrows furrowed, and asked, "Miss, are you trying to steal the body of that god? But our lord's teachings are not to disturb the dead."

"Ah, so you say. But do you do?" Anny suddenly became emotional, her tone flat and sarcastic, "Really think I know where the ancient gods' tombs are hidden?"

Vivian, who had been instructed by Anny for five months, heard the implications in Anny's words and was about to insist, but then thought of Anny's relationship with her lord and fell silent.

However, as a mage who could reverse the extreme camp, Vivian's gaze became more resolute, and she muttered to herself, "It's definitely because our lord's departure that Miss is so lost. It must be like that."

"I will definitely continue our lord's path and correct Miss's original trajectory."

Meanwhile, Anny seemed to feel a strange, fiery gaze, but didn't pay attention, directly handing Vivian a bag of "Mana Recovery Pearls" to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

"You take these back and restore them first. If it's not absolutely necessary, I won't take action easily. Let's wait and see how you handle the problem."

Zhao Xu didn't expect that Anniya wasn't on top, but rather pulled him down to the bottom of the lake.

However, he didn't hesitate for a moment and took out two large pearls to restore the three-ring magical position consumed by the activation of the Asmodeus Cross.

As Zhao Xu's face turned slightly red, he lifted his hand to prepare to cast the spell, "That's it, let's go down."

"Art of distance, chain art, and Sol stone art."

Instantly, the spell that allowed them to walk through natural stones was split into three parts and applied to the three of them.

A soft yellow glow enveloped the three of them, and the hard, rocky terrain beneath their feet no longer posed an obstacle.

"...There's no grand entrance."

Zhao Xu looked at the giant, dome-shaped entrance that was about 10-15 meters high and wide, and the central avenue seemed to be designed specifically for giants.

Just as a faint tremor occurred, the three of them fell out from a crevice in the stone.

However, the three people with flying magic quickly regained control of their pace and descended slowly.

"This is the mausoleum designed by Murszelin for himself, and naturally, he wouldn't consider setting up a grand entrance for guests. In fact, the entire tomb is protected by the residual divine power, and I just took advantage of a weak spot in the defensive power to sneak in."

At this moment, Anniya saw the familiar road ahead and suddenly recalled her past memories.

It was as if yesterday.
Here is the translation:

"This path has other branching roads around it, but they're all dead ends. It's just that there's a powerful guardian of the graveyard set up. You don't need to worry, just keep going forward. When you reach the end of the platform, we'll talk about it."

Anniya ordered, "But if you encounter any monsters on the left or right paths, just kill them without hesitation."

Zhao Xu nodded and tightened his grip on his magic staff, while Viviya pulled out her holy avenger and held it up ahead.

Zhao Xu noticed that their path was like the Chinese character "" (fÄ“ng), with them walking along the vertical stroke.

At the same time, the two crossroads on either side were hidden in the dark, profound darkness, and despite being dead ends, they could still hear the howling of the wind.

It made people wonder if there were hidden monsters inside.

"What kind of monsters did you encounter when you came here last time, teacher?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Intelligence is the key element of a mage's battle," Zhao Xu said. "Most people only know how to respond with brute force, but even knowing a little bit can give them a sense of preparedness. As for mages, they can choose targeted spells and even set up a sequence of spells to take out all their opponents at once."

"I don't know," Zhao Xu said. "The last time he brought me here, all the monsters were cowering down, too afraid to move."

When Zhao Xu heard this, he and Viviya almost stopped in their tracks.

Even if Anniya was here now, she wouldn't have received such treatment. The terror of that year's Ernest was only too well-known.

"However, I think most of them are undead," Zhao Xu said with a hint of sarcasm.

"Yes," Viviya agreed.
Here is the translation:

Zhaoxu agreed, saying that the divine being who oversaw the eternal rest had arranged for such an undead guardian to watch over the place, which was indeed a bit strange.

"Teacher, your investigative and listening skills should be quite high, shouldn't they? Really, there's something I'd like to remind you of," Zhaoxu cautioned.

"Don't worry, my investigative and listening skills are over 100 levels. Unless there's divine intervention or special means, I'll be the only one to discover others' secrets."

Vivianna, who had previously stayed with Madame May, almost turned around to ask Ana Noja to confirm what she had heard after hearing the term "100 levels". She thought she must have misheard it.

However, it was Ana Noja who spoke up first, saying, "Here, 40 meters to the left."

"It's probably just a standard version of the giant night worm, with a challenge level of 18, around 212 HP."

"Its magic resistance is level 31, and its fortification is level 12. All of these are things you can penetrate, and it's already dead."

At this point, Zhaoxu had already noticed a massive, black, worm-like creature with a diameter of over two to three meters in the shadows. Its body was covered in teeth and had a claw-like tail, making it look like an elongated giant centipede.

This was a terrifying creature that could burrow underground, one that Zhaoxu had previously encountered in the Land of the Eternal Rest, which was part of the same series of undead creatures as the night worms.

"Supreme Magical Control - Twin Magic, Extreme Effect, Instant Release."

"The Hammer of Justice!"

The hammer was divided into two, with full damage and compressed spellcasting time. As the three supreme magical abilities stacked up, the original hammer, which had no damage limit, accumulated an enormous amount of positive energy, transforming into a massive "War Hammer".
Here is the translation of the text:

In the blink of an eye, Zhao Xu charged towards the giant nightmarish creature, shooting it with his "Divine Hammer". As an adventurer, Zhao Xu inflicted 216 damage on the creature, causing 216 damage to its life force.

The creature took 432 HP damage!

Just as the creature was about to attack them, Zhao Xu's "Divine Hammer" struck it, directly piercing its internal organs.

"Boom!"

The creature's body, which had been lifted up, fell to the ground with a dull thud.

Zhao Xu's expression was shocked as he looked at his own hands. He had just unleashed a three-ring spell, amplified by his Magical Expertise, which he had mentally prepared for. However, the actual effect of the spell was still surprising to him.

Even for players who have reached the three-ring level, using a fireball spell would only deal 5-30 HP damage. However, Zhao Xu's "Divine Hammer" was able to instantly kill a level 18 creature with over 200 HP.

He had finally completed the "Survival Path: Arthur" and become the "Unrivaled Arthur".
