Chapter 446: One Strike to Kill

After entering the icy cold water, the three of them used the power of magic to swim to the bottom of the lake.

During this time, Zhao Xu also noticed that the lake's bottom was covered with a thick layer of frost, and the fish were swimming and dodging the big fish.

After swimming for nearly half an hour, Zhao Xu and Wei Wei followed Annie to the muddy bottom of the lake.

In his past life, Zhao Xu had also spent the summer swimming in this lake, but he had never discovered anything unusual.

"What's this?" Zhao Xu looked at Annie, who was slowly descending to a place covered with mud, using telepathy to communicate.

Aside from feeling that the bottom was murky, he couldn't detect any abnormalities.

"Not wrong, we'll continue to swim through the muddy bottom and go down for another ten kilometers or so, almost reaching the end," Annie explained.

"These ten kilometers are no longer within the reach of ordinary people," Wei Wei sighed.

"It's true that the tombs of powerful gods who have died are not accessible to anyone except for those who have died and are able to wander in the starry sky. As for those who actually have tombs, even if they know the location, it's hard to get close."

"The ten-kilometer-long lake bottom rock wall can't stop someone with a strong will who uses magic, but it can stop the ignorant and naive, and it's also a kind of protection for them. If they make a mistake, they may be trapped forever," Annie said.

"So you've been here before, teacher?" Zhao Xu was astonished.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That's definite, I can take you to that place, and I have a certain grasp on it. It's just that the tomb beneath Murszelin's forest, which has confirmed my aura, so once I cast a spell inside—"
"Will it affect Miss? Suddenly Vivian said tightly.

"Not to mention. A dead tomb won't dare to affect me, a legendary mage like me. It's not the spirit of the tomb, but a legendary mage stronger than me."

Anzol explained, "Mainly because it warned me that if I dare to enter it again, it will activate its self-destruct program, directly dragging the entire tomb to the Fire Elemental Plane, and even if other fire elementals benefit from it, I won't get a single advantage."

Vivian, who was still a bit tense, furrowed her brow and asked, "Miss, are you trying to steal the corpse of that god? But our master's teachings are to disturb not the dead."

"Ah. Well said, well done." Anzol's expression turned cold as she sneered, "You really think I would know about the ancient tomb of the gods, which is hidden away?"

Vivian, who had undergone five months of careful guidance, felt a sense of unease when she heard Anzol's words, and was about to insist, but then remembered the other's relationship with her master, and was left speechless.

However, as a demon who could reverse the extreme array, Vivian's expression became more resolute, and she muttered to herself, "It's definitely because our master has left that the current Miss is lost in her direction, it must be like this."

"I will definitely continue our master's road and correct Miss's original trajectory."

Meanwhile, Anzol seemed to feel a strange, fiery gaze, but didn't pay attention and directly handed a bag of "Mystic Restorative Pearls" to Zhao Xiu.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"You take these and recover first, unless it's absolutely necessary, I won't take action easily. When the time comes, it's up to you to solve the problem."

Zhao Xu was not expecting that Anzhi Noya was not on top, but rather had dragged him to the lake bottom.

However, he didn't hesitate at all, and directly took out two slightly larger pearls to activate the three-ring magic circle that had consumed the Arsenic Cross of the Abyss.

As Zhao Xu's face turned slightly red, he directly raised his hand to prepare to cast a spell, "That's it, let's go."

"Send the spell, send the chain spell, and the Sol Stone path spell."

Instantly, this spell that allowed them to walk through the natural stone, was divided into three and applied to the three of them.

A faint yellow light enveloped the three of them, and the hard, rocky ground beneath their feet no longer posed an obstacle.

"...It's really not a big door."

Zhao Xu looked at the giant, arched dome in front of him, which was about 10-15 meters from top to bottom and as wide as a highway. It seemed to have been designed from the start for giant-sized beings to walk.

Just as a faint tremor occurred, the three of them fell out from somewhere in the stone crevice.

However, the three people with flying magic quickly controlled their pace and descended slowly.

"This is the tomb designed by the Murszelin for himself, naturally, it won't consider arranging a big door for guests. In fact, the entire tomb is protected by the remaining divine power. I just brought you guys through a weak point in the defense."

At this moment, Anzhi Noya saw the familiar road ahead and suddenly remembered the past.

It was as if yesterday.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This path has several branches around it, but they're all dead ends, with only some powerful undead soldiers guarding the graves. You don't need to worry, just keep walking forward. When you reach the end of the path, we'll discuss it."

Anastasia ordered, "However, if any monsters appear from the side paths, you two will kill them without hesitation."

Zhao Xu nodded and tightened his grip on his staff, while Vivian also drew out her sacred avenger and held it at the front.

Zhao Xu noticed that their path was like a Chinese character "丰" (), with them walking along the "竖" ().

At the same time, the crossroads on both sides were hidden in the dark, seemingly dead ends, but they could hear the howling of the wind. It made people suspect that there might be hidden monsters inside.

"Teacher, did you encounter any monsters when you came here before?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Information" is the first key element in a mage's battle. Zhao Xu could calmly set up a layout, knowing the opponent's strengths and weaknesses.

Ordinary people can only respond to emergencies with brute force. Even knowing the information is just a psychological preparation. Mages, on the other hand, can choose targeted spells and even set up a sequence of spells to take down all the enemies at once.

"I don't know," he said. "When he brought me here before, all the monsters were huddled in a fetal position, too afraid to move."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu and Vivian almost stopped in their tracks.

Even Anastasia, who arrived here now, did not receive such treatment. The horror of that year's Ernest was well-known.

"However, I guess most of them are undead creatures, quite ironic."

"Indeed."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Xu agreed, saying that the spirits that reside in eternal slumber would arrange for the immortal beings to guard this place, which was indeed a bit strange.

"Teacher, your detective and listening skills should be high enough, right? You should remind me if there's something important," Zhang Xu reminded.

"Don't worry, my detective and listening skills are over 100 levels. Unless divine power or special means intervene, no one else can detect it," he said.

Before that, Viola, who had stayed with the May Lady, almost turned around to confirm with Annye, thinking she must have misheard the term "100 levels".

However, Annye spoke up first, saying, "It's here, 40 meters to the left."

"It's probably a standard version of the giant nightshade, level 18, around 212 HP."

"Its magic resistance is level 31, and its physical strength is level 12, all of which can be broken through. You can kill it in an instant."

At this moment, Zhang Xu noticed a massive, black, worm-like creature with a diameter of over two to three meters, with a body covered in teeth and a tail with claws. Its body was like a giant centipede.

This was a terrifying, burrowing creature that Zhang Xu had encountered in the land of the sleepers, which was part of the same series of immortal beings as the nightshade.

"Super Magical Control - Twin Spells, Extreme Effect, Instant Release."

"Justice Hammer!"

The attack split into three, dealing damage and compressing the spellcasting time. With the three super magical skills stacked, the original "Justice Hammer" that did not have a damage limit suddenly accumulated an enormous amount of positive energy, transforming into a massive "War Hammer".
Here is the translation:

"In the blink of an eye, he charged towards the giant insect night shadow. [Adventurer Xia, you caused 216 points of force damage to the giant insect night shadow, and 216 points of force damage through the duplicate effect.]
432 points of damage!

At this moment, Zhao Xu released two "Scales of Justice" hammer strikes, and before the giant insect night shadow had even approached to attack them, it was invaded by the energy and its internal body organization was shattered.

"Thud."

The giant insect night shadow's body, which had just lifted up, fell to the ground with a dull sound.

Zhao Xu's expression was also filled with shock as he looked at his own hands.

He had just combined his own magic with three rings of enhanced magic, although he had mentally prepared for it, but the actual effect of the enhanced magic still surprised him!

Even in the current game, if a player reaches three rings and uses the fireball spell, the damage would be around 5-30 HP.

However, Zhao Xu's "Scales of Justice" hammer strike, which was amplified by his magic, was able to instantly kill a monster of level 18 or higher with over 200 HP.

He had finally completed the "Survival Route: Arthur" and become "Arthur Unrivaled"."
