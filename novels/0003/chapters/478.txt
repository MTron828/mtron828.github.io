Chapter 479: The Abyss is Watching You

"What?"

As the city defense force and the garrison police launched a massive operation, accompanied by the arrival of reinforcement mages, the people who had come to the "Scarlet Lips" nightclub for entertainment and the service girls who worked there were finally dug out from the collapsed buildings underground.

The legendary magical statues of gold and silver, as if dozens of excavators were simultaneously opened, unleashed an unstoppable force that demolished the entire group of buildings within the city walls, leaving not a single intact building.

Most people suffered from minor injuries caused by falling debris, while a few elderly individuals who tripped and fell were crushed by falling rocks.

After the first count of the number of casualties, the second-in-command of the garrison police, who was temporarily dispatched to handle the situation, looked grave, deep in thought.

"Hasn't Kuroze been found?" he asked loudly, questioning the subordinate who was reporting to him.

As a long-established red-light district, the Scarlet Lips was meticulous in recording the details of its clientele.

Or, Kuroze might have been using these establishments to gather influence among the high-ranking officials of Orlu and the alliance.

Therefore, even if there were high-ranking officials of the alliance who were committed to justice and righteousness, they would still face immense resistance and pressure in trying to shut down these establishments and capture Kuroze, the "black-hearted leader".

"Commander Voren," said the dim-witted wizard beside him, unable to help himself from making a sarcastic remark, "Don't tell me that the underground passages of the Defense Ministry have no hidden paths at all?"

Although Ori City has a curfew at night, with half of the guards' duties transferred to the city guards, this time the "Defense Ministry" patrol team was unexpectedly late.

Moreover, as Commander Voren, the deputy of the Defense Ministry, he obtained the highest "command authority" as soon as he arrived, directly dismissing the cavalry commander of the other side's city guard system.

This made the wizard speculate on the high-level intrigue.

"Yes, Commander Voren," a reporting personnel suggested, "If we don't hurry, I'm afraid Mr. Kuzo, who is missing, may be in danger."

"Of course, those prisoners have been missing for a while now, and who knows if they're standing firm," he said, raising his voice a few decibels, as if he wanted to make sure others remembered that he was the one who spoke.

"That's right," Commander Voren, with a few scars on his face like badges of honor, looked at Tolbi, who was not under his direct command, with a serious expression.

As a member of the Defense Ministry's "Major Case Department", Tolbi often contacted Kuzo, the underground leader, due to work reasons.

Commander Voren rubbed his stomach, which was still full from his recent meal, and ordered directly, "Now that the search is almost over, let the detective search team take the lead, and the others will cooperate to see if there are any hidden passages on the ground."

As he turned around to look at the wizard team behind him, he asked, "Can you wizards provide some magical support?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The wizards in front of Arthur remained still, while the other players' wizards stood up and said, "Commander, we're ready to go." As the players integrated into Arthur's forces, those who had joined the defense department began to choose special spells for reconnaissance, exploration, and identification according to the department's needs.

Fern was also smiling with satisfaction.

Compared to the local wizards who had spent ten years studying to become wizards, these "players" from Earth were paid much less and were more active and proactive in their daily lives. They were like the most diligent interns in the workplace.

However, these players had a hard time staying in Arthur's forces for a long time and could only work part-time jobs in the defense department.

One of the local wizards couldn't help but mock the players, saying, "How enthusiastic!"

The player wizards, however, pretended not to hear.

The leading player wizard turned around and instructed his companions, "First, prepare to cast 'Detect Secret Door.' We'll spread out in a star shape in four directions, and return immediately after the spell is finished."

When the people of Earth from previous times crossed over, many forces in Arthur's forces had already recruited players.

Looking at the initial chaos and disorder of the Earth alliance, many high-ranking players lost their enthusiasm and brought their families to join their respective forces.

Even Zhao Xu chose to develop in the North Star Town in the Northern Alliance, where most of the players were from Earth. He also struggled to balance his two identities.

So, when Wang Qingwei integrated the entire Earth force and visited the Northern Alliance to seek help, these players deep in the Northern Alliance felt like they were from a different world.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

At this moment, the vast expanse of desolation stretches out before us, with debris and rubble scattered across the ground. There are at least over a hundred investigation personnel standing on the ground, all busy inspecting the area, trying to find the mysterious "secret passage".

Finally, with the sudden cry of a lucky individual, the attention of those around was drawn to the existence of the first secret passage.

Subsequently, after the few high-ranking officials of the Red Lips remaining awakened, they recalled the location of the remaining two secret passages.

Among the three secret passages, two led to short-lived, difficult-to-break-through secret chambers, while the last one led to a residential area hundreds of meters outside.

However, there were no signs of the passage leading to the residential area being opened. The air inside was stale, and judging from the cobwebs and tangled grass outside the adjacent exit, it seemed that "the missing Kuroze" had not arrived here.

As a result, the entire search team focused their attention on one sealed-off secret passage entrance.

After using the unlocking technique and combining it with the "attack hammer" weapon specifically designed for the task, the stone floor was immediately broken open.

The commander-in-chief of the scene, Vern, had received inquiries from at least seven high-ranking officials of the alliance within the past half hour.

If the incident of Red Lips being attacked only sparked the attention of high-ranking officials.
The disappearance of the underground leader of the Kuroze in Orlo city, which threw a deep shockwave into the peaceful winter night.

Ultimately, Kuroze's involvement in "relationships" was too deep, and the network of supply and nurture was extremely vast.

He had operated in Orlo city for over twenty years, even influencing the growth of many prominent figures, leaving his mark.

Once he was involved in something, the "account book" would be thrown out, and Orlo city would be shaken to its core.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the city of Aurou, the benevolent church faces the "darkness" that lurks beneath the surface, and ignoring it would be acceptable. However, once these things come to light, all the churches in the northern region will intervene and ask questions. It's clear that "Fen" is the key to understanding the severity of the situation. He quickly summoned his trusted personnel to join him, but he couldn't stop Dimas the wizard, who didn't fall under his jurisdiction. Dimas' appearance tonight is a witness to this event for the northern branch of the wizarding association.

His written report will influence the association's views and final decisions regarding tonight's event. After eliminating a few booby traps and navigating a narrow tunnel, the group finally arrived at a secret stone chamber. Without the need for a wizard to be present, a few adventurers quickly approached and disarmed the mechanism, causing the "heavy wall" to slowly rise.

"Ah?"

The scene lit by the yellowish-brown lamp inside the chamber was so shocking that even someone who had seen it all was taken aback. "It's really ruthless. The Kurouze family has many enemies, but it takes a lot of courage to dare to do something like this and not fear the revenge of the entire underground force, including the alliance."

Dimas the wizard couldn't help but express his admiration. Even if he and Kurouze had a deep-seated feud, it's unlikely that anyone would take it to such an extreme.

Isn't this directly challenging the entire alliance?

"Dimas, be careful what you say," Commander Fen quickly retorted. "We have no official connection with people like that."

However, he was equally unwilling to call Kurouze by a derogatory name, even though the latter was now powerless to threaten him.
Here is the translation of the text:

In front of the crowd, inside the stone room, stood "Kurouze", who could make the children of Olur City cry just by his name. However, his originally plump face had become extremely thin and gaunt, his eyes were wide open, and his pupils were white with no hint of vitality.

Kurouze's entire body seemed to be paddling through water, his hands constantly thrusting forward, yet grasping at empty air. A thick iron chain was wrapped around his waist, secured to the wall behind him.

He had become an undead being, the lowest level of zombie.

"It seems that the caster has been found," said Dimah, the wizard.

"Causing chaos at the scene, making Kurouze flee in a hurry through the secret passage, allowing him to escape the guards and unable to put on the magical armor. It seems that the plan was made from the start to make him reach this point, creating a perfect, undisturbed killing chamber," Dimah continued.

"Is it possible that the existence of this hidden chamber has been leaked out?"

Just then, Tobelby, a member of the Watch, managed to squeeze in behind and saw the scene, almost fainting. He mumbled to himself, "Dimah, if it's you, can you locate Kurouze, Mr.?" Dimah shook his head, "I don't know him, it's too unfamiliar for me to use the locating spell."

As for increasing the familiarity to enhance the effectiveness of the locating spell, Dimah didn't bother to explain it to them.

"Not a wizard, do you know all that?" Tobelby said with a sigh.

"Who do you think did it?" Tobelby asked again.

"You ask me, I'll ask someone," Dimah said, waving his hand in dismissal.

Meanwhile, Commandant Fren entered the room, bent down to touch the bloodstained floor, and then looked around the walls.
Here is the translation of the text:

The blood on the ground looked like it was going to overflow, and Commander Fuen analyzed, "Can this Kuroze have so much blood flowing?" "Strip off his clothes." Two subordinates immediately stepped forward, using wooden bars to immobilize Kuroze's hands, which had turned into a zombie's hands, and were about to remove his coat.

Just then, a single drop of blood fell on his forehead.

Everyone suddenly looked up, gazing at the three-meter-high stone ceiling, the source of the blood.

"What is this?" someone asked.

The dim lighting, Dimma the wizard, noticed that the ceiling had a layer of fresh blood written in characters, which was somewhat faint and difficult to read.

With the aid of his enhanced vision strengthened by his own powers, he struggled to decipher the text: "This is a script from the Netherworld, meaning..."

"What is it?" the people around him couldn't help but ask.

However, this wizard, who had been so calm and collected throughout the journey, remained silent, without responding to anyone's intentions.

Only after a long time did he manage to open his mouth with difficulty:

"The Abyss is watching you, Glazt."
