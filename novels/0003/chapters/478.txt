At this moment, the ground is full of ruins and debris, and more than a hundred investigators are busy inspecting the ground, trying to find the mysterious "secret passage".
Eventually, with a lucky exclamation, the first secret passage was revealed, catching the attention of the surrounding people.
Then, a few of the remaining senior officials woke up and, based on their memories, the other two secret passages were found.
Among the three secret passages, two led to secret rooms that were difficult to break into in a short time, while the last one led to a house several hundred meters away.
However, there were no traces of the secret passage leading to the house being opened, and the air inside did not circulate at all. Based on the condition of the house at the exit, which was still covered in cobwebs and overgrown with weeds, the "missing Kuroze" did not reach there.
So the entire search team focused on one of the sealed secret passage entrances.
With the casting of unlocking spells and the use of specially brought "siege hammers," the sealed stone floor was soon smashed open.
The highest commander on the scene, Vurn, had been questioned by no less than seven senior members of the alliance in the past half hour.
If the attack on the Flame Red Lips only attracted the attention of the senior officials, then the disappearance of Kuroze, the underground leader of Oru City, cast a deep shock on this peaceful winter night in Oru City.
In the end, Kuroze's deeply involved "relationships" were too deep, and the network through which he supplied nutrients was extremely vast.
He had been operating in Oru City for over twenty years, and his traces could be found in the growth of many important figures.
If something were to happen to him, and any "accounts" were to be revealed, Oru City would definitely be shaken to its core.

"The amount of blood on the ground looks terrifyingly large. Can Kuroze have so much blood to shed?" Commander Fuen analyzed, "Go and unbutton his clothes."

Immediately, two subordinates stepped forward and used wooden sticks to hold Kuroze, who had turned into a zombie, by his hands, and were about to take off his coat.

But suddenly, a drop of blood fell on his forehead.

Immediately, everyone couldn't help but look up at the three-meter-high stone ceiling, the source of the drop of blood.

"What language is this?" 

In the dim light, Mage Dimaf saw a layer of text written in blood on the ceiling, the handwriting was somewhat simple and difficult to recognize.

Using his enhanced vision, he barely made out, "This is Infernal language, it means-"

"What is it?" the people around couldn't help but ask.

However, Dimaf, who had been carefree all the way, remained silent and did not respond to the others.

After a long time, he finally spoke with difficulty-

"The Abyss is watching you, Graszt."
