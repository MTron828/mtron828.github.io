Chapter 382: Conversations of the Dead

Zhao Xu's words suddenly plunged everyone into deep thought.

Although Zhao Xu had previously witnessed the instantaneous death spell and was even capable of casting it himself with his staff, these were still far removed from ordinary low-level adventurers.

In fact, anyone who had not survived the instantaneous death spell and did not possess an "immunity circle" would, in the absence of magical defense, be essentially doomed to death.

However, the instantaneous death spell was so high-level that it had not yet gained a notorious reputation among ordinary people.

Therefore, no one initially reacted to the possibility.

The instantaneous death spell was too far removed from them.

The same was true for mages, who would only be able to cast the death spell when they reached a certain level, at which point the spell would no longer be able to handle the enemies they faced.

Zhao Xu had already taken a step forward and walked straight into the tent where the corpses were laid out.

Viola followed closely behind him, with many people unable to suppress their desire to fight against this extraordinary girl.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu entered the tent that the remaining adventurers, including those with some sense of identity, couldn't help but follow him in.

After a half-day of silent communication, everyone had vaguely confirmed one thing.

That is, Zhao Xu and the bodyguard by his side were not from Luca City.

According to the apprentice priest's speculation, the person who had used an extremely exquisite sword to successfully kill the woman who had been collecting protection fees from the wandering rogue, was likely a Saint Warrior.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Because the sword that eliminates evil is likely to be the Cutting Off Evil, it's almost a certainty!
Saint warriors rarely bend their knees for five pecks of rice, unless their faith and conviction align with their inner beliefs. Otherwise, they rarely accept external tasks.
As everyone quickly guessed, the man who could be protected by a saint warrior was likely a high-ranking priest of the temple.
Combining this with the recent waves of migration and fleeing, a few sharp players even made bold judgments.
The man in front of us might be a middle-to-high-ranking clergy member going to the Northern Alliance.
Following them through this mist, it's natural to protect everyone.
Thinking about it, it means that this priest's vicinity is the safest location.
As Zhao Xu entered the tent, which was roughly the size of a single-person room, he noticed that a group of players had followed him in, just like a bunch of mosquitoes.
However, Zhao Xu didn't pay much attention and walked straight to the face of the deceased bard, who was still wearing a luxurious robe, despite having migrated to the Northern Alliance, unlike the usual attire of a bard adventurer.

At this moment, the bard's eyes opened wide, with dilated pupils, appearing frozen and ice-cold, indicating that he couldn't believe he had suddenly died.
"Xiaoxia, have you ever touched a bard?" Zhao Xu asked.
Xiaoxia shook her head.
The people behind finally realized that the beautiful saint warrior girl was actually named Xiaoxia.
However, they all tried to recall, but couldn't remember a saint warrior named Xiaoxia in the nearby city.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The wandering poets travel from place to place, collecting local legends and retelling them, using music as their medium to enchant the audience, making them either joyful or sorrowful."

As Zhao Xu paused, he gazed at the faint marks on the corpse with a hint of observation.

He glanced at another poet player in the room.

Poets, due to their innate singing abilities, are easier to master magic compared to wizards and clergy, making them a popular choice among players.

However, it's difficult for 1st-level poets to level up, and even more so for 2nd-level poets.

Players have come to realize that defeating monsters is not the only way to level up. Many bards have defeated countless monsters and earned the title of "Monster Killer," yet they still feel no closer to reaching 2nd level.

As a result, they have had to choose alternative routes to level up.

"Sir, could you elaborate on the poet's content?"

At this point, another group of poet players, who had accompanied the deceased, stood in the corner, looking dazed and disoriented, as if they had been struck by a massive blow.

However, their eyes sparkled with determination, as if they had found the path ahead.

For a moment, everyone around them was taken aback by the enigmatic conversation between the two.

Zhao Xu heard this sentence and knew he wasn't playing to a blind audience.

He had paid attention to the difficulties faced by poets in the forums and had been waiting for the right moment to spread the "secret".

The adventurers in Lucas Castle, who weren't poets, not only lacked emotional depth but also lacked suitable channels for dissemination. However, that poet player was different, and with the aid of online forums and networks, he had a unique advantage.
At this moment, other players looked at the poet, who was also a player, with a solemn expression, as if they were bowing down to a mysterious man. They all realized that something extraordinary was happening before their eyes.

"The poet needs to face various people," continued Zhao Xu, reciting the content he had seen in the legend library, which was written by the god of poetry.

"So they often engage in careers such as diplomats, coordinators, messengers, scouts, or spies."

Zhao Xu briefly summarized what the poet should do and what kind of career they should pursue. He also noticed that other non-poet players were quietly listening.

"What does this mean?" a barbarian player who didn't understand the situation scratched his head.

Someone nearby pulled his fur cloak, saying, "Don't talk too much, this is a teaching moment."

"If the poet decides to participate in the turmoil of Luca City, what should they do?" the poet player immediately asked.

Zhao Xu replied directly, "The poet's magic comes from their heart, so they need to follow their heart's choice. Good poets can bring hope and courage to the unfortunate and use magic to counter evil plots. Even in the face of tyrants, they will resist tyranny and inspire those who are being persecuted while on the run."

As for evil poets, who manipulate people's hearts and confuse the audience, Zhao Xu didn't want to say more.

"May I ask your name?" The poet player, who had been standing in the corner, bowed deeply to Zhao Xu.

He had already known many poet players, and he knew that after hearing these words, they would find a breakthrough direction.

"This isn't what I said, it's what Dideran said," Zhao Xu said calmly.

This name left everyone bewildered, and for a moment, they all fell silent. Dideran was the god of poetry and music.
Here is the translation:

They don't dare to mention his name like Zhao Xu. Before everyone's gasps, Zhao Xu had already raised his hand to cast a spell - a "Death Dialogue" spell that normally takes 10 minutes to cast, was compressed to a single round by Zhao Xu's expertise as a multi-talented spellcaster.

The originally deceased body, which had begun to turn cold, slowly regained its vitality. In this way, the deceased bard suddenly sat up.

"What's going on?"

This sudden move instantly startled a few timid girls in the audience.

Several people who had just participated in the private autopsy were certain that the body was indeed dead.

"It's not, but it's not a necromancy spell that transforms into an undead creature," another spellcaster commented.

"Don't be ridiculous, this is 'Death Dialogue', a three-ring divine spell," the middle-aged warrior who had started the autopsy corrected.

Having worked at the temple, he had also seen this kind of spell.

At this point, everyone was too afraid to disturb Zhao Xu, and they all looked at the warrior, waiting for his explanation.

"This spell can temporarily restore a corpse's life and intelligence, allowing it to answer questions," the warrior said.

"This spell is powerful, it only makes the corpse's body regain consciousness fragments, so even if the soul has dispersed, this spell can still take effect," Zhao Xu added.

At this point, Zhao Xu asked the awakened bard.

The deceased poet, who had regained consciousness, opened his mouth to answer with a dry tone: "I don't know... I started to feel drowsy and suddenly became disoriented, and then I lost my life."

The poet's words were unclear, with his tongue and teeth sloppy, forming a striking contrast with his lively and articulate manner in life.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu also struggled to distinguish what was being said for a while before knowing what was being said.
While everyone originally saw Zhou Xu perform such a miraculous spell, they thought they could catch the truth and were eagerly expecting it.
Who would have thought that everything was still unclear.
The corpse was still speaking at this time, "I only remember that just before I lost consciousness, I seemed to see a mysterious diagram."
"Thunder strikes the earth, and the whirlwind is fierce."
That mysterious diagram in the godly tomb!
It is also the clue in the notebook!
