Chapter 391 Mysterious Wooden Stick
The attacking power of the super giant variant scorpion is only at the 34th level, but its ability to grasp reaches as high as 58 under the influence of strength.
It can be immune to damage from non-magical weapon attacks, but it cannot resist being grasped, so this is what can trap it.
At the same time, once it is caught in this way, the pressure of free fall is inevitable for it.
It will be caught and then crushed on the spot.
Even the variant scorpion itself has the unique ability of "tightening", as long as it is caught, it will suffer damage equivalent to an attack due to this tightening force.
So even though Zhao Xuming understands that the variant scorpion carries something similar to a "portal" spell item, or even has the innate talent that ordinary variant scorpions do not have.
He still has to solve the current dilemma first.
At this time, Zhao Xu's gaze swept across the distant lights on the mountain range at night.
Although time is extremely urgent, he is still thinking calmly.
Even if he uses "Wings of Shelter" again to block this grasp, he cannot stop the opponent's imminent overwhelming force.
This is also the intention of the variant scorpion to relentlessly pursue and kill him.
But Zhao Xuming still has a trump card.
He can use the secondary swift burst, and then combine it with the teleportation ability of his boots, with a range of seven meters, which just allows him to move horizontally out of the range of the variant scorpion's coverage.
But at that time, he will face a full 6 seconds of magical aftereffects and be stunned.
The "Recovery Contract" that Antinoya previously cast on him could have automatically resolved this situation.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu's "Super Magical Control" attribute damage was too frequent and had already been triggered in the fog, consuming the spell's energy. This also made Zhou Xu realize that the spell's coverage was too broad and would trigger automatically if not maintained. Zhou Xu couldn't wait for 6 seconds, as the mutated spider would flash and fall from the air, and he would become minced meat. Since Zhou Xu hadn't yet used his "Instant Time Dilation" spell to slow down time, he was thinking quickly, and the mutated spider's two giant pincers were also closing in on him. Even the spider had already run back to the nearby area, waiting to bite down on the falling Zhou Xu.

This extraordinary hatred caught his attention.

In this flash of insight, Zhou Xu's mind became clear, and numerous plans crystallized instantly, becoming one cohesive whole.

He smiled slightly, as he had already thought of a solution.

Since he had thought of a way out, he would take it one step further and turn the tables.

Zhou Xu watched the mutated spider, holding up his "Super Magic Instant Trigger" staff.

Before the spider's claw touched him, Zhou Xu lightly blocked it with his staff.

His 8-point strength couldn't withstand the claw's closure, which exceeded 30 points of strength.

However, it was beyond everyone's expectation.

The mutated spider suddenly became weak and powerless, as if it had lost all mobility. The two giant pincers were easily blocked by Zhou Xu's staff.

A cold shiver ran down my spine!
This spell could only be triggered by close combat, which meant Zhou Xu had ignored the opponent's natural armor and would trigger automatically.
Here is the translation of the text:

A colossal, mutant scorpion with 35 powers, with only 8 agility points, and not even using the super magical control of Zhao Xu to extend the spellcasting time, suddenly lost all control and became as limp as a dead body.

In an instant, Zhao Xu, who had lost the ability to act, directly activated his flight ability and flew away from the shadow of the mutant scorpion, which had been hovering above.

The scorpion, still paralyzed, fell to the ground, its location being the web of a spider, where many civilians were trapped.

As the scorpion fell, another tragic scene unfolded.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes flashed with lightning speed, his fingers extended, and he shouted, "Feather Falling!"

This technique, originally left for Zhao Xu as a retreat option, had no stance requirements and could still be cast even if he was grabbed.

If Zhao Xu didn't counterattack the mutant scorpion, even if he fell, he would still be in a state of being grabbed and unable to move freely.

As the energy of the Feather Falling technique landed on the mutant scorpion, it had already stopped its rapid descent and greatly reduced the damage from the fall.

In an instant, Zhao Xu continued to cast the technique, gathering the energy in his palm and then firing it like a cannonball towards the mutant scorpion.

The technique, "Frosty Touch", was extremely effective this time, without Zhao Xu pursuing speed.

The technique extracted 18 agility points from the mutant scorpion, instantly knocking it to the ground.

At this moment, both colossal, mutant creatures were under Zhao Xu's control, trapped in a state of helplessness that lasted for 12 rounds.

Because they couldn't move, they could only rely on their natural defense to defend themselves.
Here is the translation of the text:

After that, even without Zhao Xu's intervention, the low-level adventurers surrounding them rushed over to attack the two insect-like creatures, following Zhao Xu's instructions and targeting their weak points.

As a stream of foul-smelling liquid erupted, the two creatures' lives began to weaken.

By the 12th round, they had already accomplished a great deal.

Even Vi Vi, alone and single-handed, could have killed one of them in the 12-round mindless output space. With the support of numerous adventurers, it was child's play.

At this time, the fleeing team heading to the Northern Alliance reorganized their formation. Many of them came from different family clans, and some were even solo adventurers.

Thanks to the recent threat, everyone felt a sense of mutual reliance and cooperation, and they worked together to re-establish their camp, restoring order and calming their nerves.

Only a few unlucky ones who had been crushed by the falling mutated scorpions needed to rest for a while.

"Sir, these are the items the two mutated insects were just trying to fight over," said an elderly man with great reputation, who was pushed forward by the fleeing team to communicate with Zhao Xu.

As Zhao Xu listened to his description, he slowly began to understand the entire story.

It was incredible that this group of adventurers, with nothing to do at night, had stumbled upon a mysterious nest, and then a group of small, mutated scorpions suddenly appeared.

Several adventurers quickly grabbed a treasure chest and took off.

In the end, the adventurers who had rushed back to the main team were caught by the giant, mutated scorpions that had descended from the sky and were swallowed whole, becoming the main course.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unexpectedly, a behemoth-sized mutant spider lurking in the nearby bushes was attracted to the treasure box and jumped out to snatch it, leading to the scene that Zhao Xuan and others witnessed. "Aren't you going to take it?" Zhao Xuan asked, looking at the long, rectangular yellow copper treasure box, which wasn't heavy despite its size.

As Zhao Xuan asked, the old man quickly bowed his head, saying, "You saved us, so you should take this treasure."

In reality, the old man was still a bit uneasy. According to reason, if they had been saved by a single saintly warrior, they could have gotten away with it. But in front of them was someone who looked like the legendary wizard, and they had to give him something in return.

Now, they had a treasure box with unknown contents, and they could use it as a bargaining chip. If the wizard accepted the treasure box, it meant he had accepted their payment, as gambling was human nature.

Thinking about the treasure box brought to mind the battle between the behemoth-sized mutant spider and the mutant scorpion, and how it both excited and terrified them. Especially since the first few people who brought back the treasure box had already died.

With too many people seeing the treasure box, it was hard to divide it. So, the old man suggested giving the treasure box to the wizard who had killed two giant mutant creatures, as long as he accepted it as payment. This idea was universally approved by everyone.

Zhao Xuan also nodded silently. As someone who had saved ordinary civilians in the past, he knew what it meant. Besides saintly warriors, adventurers didn't have to work for free.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

When he opened it, he hadn't thought too much about it, although it didn't seem likely to compensate for this time's reward. Just his luck, he struck it rich. He happily accepted it.

Zhao Xǔ immediately used his detection magic to examine the box and found that it was a mysterious magic box. In addition to the extra magic seal on the box, he had also intentionally cast the "Secret Lock" spell on it. This spell would increase the difficulty of opening the box.

The unintelligent spider, unable to open the box with brute force, was naturally at a loss. Zhao Xǔ didn't say a word and used his "Tapping Technique" to disable the "Secret Lock" spell. Then he thought carefully and, based on the pattern on the box, inferred that it was a wheel lock.

However, with his current intelligence, it took him almost 10-15 minutes to break the code and open the box. At this time, he heard a "click" sound, indicating that he had opened the lock. Everyone's eyes turned to him.

Although the copper box was now in Zhao Xǔ's possession, it didn't dampen their curiosity. Zhao Xǔ, being cautious, slowly opened the box, revealing a small gap. However, just as he was about to expand it, he was startled by the sudden explosion of a trap.

Luckily, everything turned out well.

Inside the copper box, a wooden stick was quietly lying. The people who had gathered to watch all shook their heads in disappointment. Only Zhao Xǔ, suppressing his inner turmoil, looked at the wooden stick. He had seen this wooden stick in the lost treasure room of the Ittier Kingdom that Anzhi had taken him to.
