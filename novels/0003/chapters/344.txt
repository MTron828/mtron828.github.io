Chapter 345: True Appearance

As Zhao Xu completely advanced to level 6, his entire character panel suddenly transformed, and various professional skills burst forth.

He was no longer like he used to be. After obtaining professional levels, he had to continue to cultivate his skills.

The last time he had obtained professional skills so effortlessly, without any other grinding or training, was when he relied on his dual elite profession to obtain most of the priest's abilities.

This was also the reason Zhao Xu completed the priest training in just one day, breaking all players' records.

However, this time Zhao Xu did not spend too much time observing his newly obtained skills. His expression remained normal, and he turned around to look at An Ti Nuo Ya.

Over the past few days, he and An Ti Nuo Ya had not met frequently.

This time, he was preparing to make a breakthrough, and he only mentioned it to her.

Unexpectedly, she appeared again.

Zhao Xu also realized that he had not accumulated enough.

As he opened the "notebook", he would indeed gain an additional level, but it seemed that it would only allow him to become a level 6 mage.

The difficulty of following the original route and opening a new route did not match.

Zhao Xu almost lost his footing here.

"Teacher, thank you," Zhao Xu said with a nod of gratitude.

"Yes, it's okay to reach this level in three months," An Ti Nuo Ya said with a cheerful tone, as if what she had done was not worth mentioning.

This was also the first time Zhao Xu had heard a hint of satisfaction in her words.

Although it was a bit strange, he still felt a genuine sense of joy.

Since you've reached level 6, your new assignments will come quickly. You've been attending classes and can take on a few short-term tasks to solidify your new professional skills.

"Yeah, I will," Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.

He knew that this time, he might really have to leave Mistral for a long time.

After going through the difficulties of leveling up from 5 to 6, he had become clear.

At least, he wouldn't be able to accumulate a few months' worth of experience in one go. "Okay, once you've officially broken through to level 7 and become a four-ring mage, you can return to Mistral," Anzhiya continued to arrange Zhao Xu's "game-like" life experience.

At this point, Zhao Xu had already become a member of the Arthurian Mage Association, with greater authority than ordinary players. On the other hand, he also lost some freedom.

At least, the arrangements for the past few days were all decided by Anzhiya.

In her eyes, Zhao Xu had always been receiving training in a daze.

Although Zhao Xu was not officially leaving today, he felt that perhaps they would not see each other again for a short period of time.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's heart welled up with questions he had always wanted to ask but had not dared to.

After all, they wouldn't see each other for a short period of time, and time could break through all awkwardness.

"How's it?" At this point, Anzhiya, who had just finished a strange "wish" spell, also recovered.

She sat down in another chair next to the alchemy experiment table, her expression calm.

"Just this branch of fate, should I consider myself your disciple?" Zhao Xu asked tentatively.

But Anzhiya just smiled slightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, she was still wearing a cloak that covered her hat, which hid most of her facial features. However, Zhao Xu could still see from the bright eyes beneath her hat that she had a gentle gaze. "No matter what happens, you and I are teacher-student relationships," Anzhi Noya summarized.

"That's a problem, teacher," Zhao Xu said, trying to start his self-closing logic.

"What?" Anzhi Noya asked.

"It's just that I've never seen your face from the past to the present," Zhao Xu continued to probe.

"Oh?" Anzhi Noya replied.

"Teacher, it's not possible that only legendary-level characters can see your true face?" Zhao Xu asked again.

Zhao Xu noticed that Anzhi Noya was about to speak and quickly added more.

Although some things had passed a long time ago, this time meeting the magic goddess Sylvina still made him recall his learning experience in the floating city before graduating from the first level.

And after encountering the mage Lyra, he learned that Anzhi Noya was related to the legendary "Itel". Even the royal inheritance was now in her hands.

Zhao Xu was clear that this world would not have unexplained love. Even though he and Anzhi Noya were both "dual geniuses" and "potential points" holders, her concern for him was far beyond what he could repay.

It was a bit heavy for Zhao Xu to know how to repay her.

Ordinary players in the game would usually get NPC favors and then leave, with only a few thinking they were special and could make NPCs take notice. Only he knew that this was how difficult it was.

This was also the reason why Anzhi Noya's words, even if just a gentle whisper, could still make him unconsciously execute his subconscious.

With Zhao Xu's memories of his past life, unless he continues to walk the path of a warrior, he would probably still be an ordinary 1st-level mage now. Even with good luck, he might only break through to 2nd level.

Reincarnation is more about seizing the opportunity to become "Arthur" and knowing the existence of the strong warriors on Earth in the future.

As for others, his level is too low, making it extremely difficult to intervene. Just the journey alone can stop countless people.

As for Arthur, there might be some treasure left behind, but it has already been dug up by Arthur's original inhabitants. Where would the players have the chance to dig up any leftovers?

This reminds one of the "legend" mentioned by An Ti Nuo Ya, as well as topics such as "helping hands" and attacking the depths.

Perhaps she needs Zhao Xu to grow to a certain extent before she can help him.

Zhao Xu is not opposed to this and is even curious about what he might be able to do. Just as Zhao Xu was lost in thought, contemplating the unknown.

An Ti Nuo Ya spoke up, saying, "It's not that big of a deal."

"Just because I don't want others to point fingers at me, so after getting this cloak that can block all lines of sight, and adding the 'True Knowledge' that can see through illusions and dark magic, I prefer to wear it."

"Just didn't think this would cause you so much trouble, and I didn't consider it thoroughly."

An Ti Nuo Ya spoke with an apologetic tone, while simultaneously lightly brushing her hair, causing Zhao Xu to jump in his seat.

However, she still did not remove the cloak, only continually twisting her hair with her fingers.

The two of them remained silent for nearly five or six minutes, with Zhao Xu initially thinking that An Ti Nuo Ya was brewing emotions, but he still didn't see An Ti Nuo Ya move.
Here is the translation of the text:

For the past half month, Zhao Xu has been searching for the family tree of the "Itel Empire" with his exceptional intelligence of 22 points, meticulously analyzing every name mentioned in the family tree. However, he has not found any clues. Even after carefully studying the naming rules of the royal family of the "Itel Empire", he still couldn't link Anniya's name to any specific period.

So, he wants to see the other person's appearance, hoping to deduce their identity from their physical features. Throughout the development of human history, human physical features are not fixed. By analyzing the migration patterns of human populations, combining geographical and historical records, and using certain key features, it is possible to infer the other person's identity.

As long as Zhao Xu can pinpoint the direction, he can use his knowledge of nobility, royal families, geography, and history to make an approximate judgment about Anniya's place of origin.

However, this requires him to continuously accumulate and apply his knowledge and skills in these areas.

"Teacher?" Zhao Xu felt that Anniya seemed to be in a trance, and couldn't help but remind her.

"Oh, nothing," Anniya replied, looking dazed and confused.

"Teacher, then?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but bring up the past.

Although he had come up with a grand excuse for himself, he still couldn't help but feel curious about his teacher's appearance. Especially after seeing the appearance of Westlinna in the flow of history, he was even more eager to see Anniya's appearance.

He had recently been collecting and contemplating the images of the first and second generations of the Magic Goddess. After the second close encounter with the Magic Goddess, Zhao Xu had developed a decoding method for distinguishing between "image appearance" and "true appearance".
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As Andiniya heard Zhao Xu's words, she let out a clear and crisp laugh, "I said it, I'm sorry about that." "Is that all?" Zhao Xu asked.

"That's not possible, right?" Andiniya replied directly, turning her head away like a coquettish girl.

Zhao Xu felt a bit uneasy, as if he was the teacher of this girl. He finally realized that Andiniya had already apologized for the trouble she caused him.

If she really intended to show him something, she wouldn't apologize.

"Zhongxia, let's go, you have a class this afternoon," Andiniya seemed to be teasing Zhao Xu, and directly urged him to leave.

"Okay." Zhao Xu didn't say much, and he also had to go and master his new professional skills.

"Zhongxia."

Just as he was about to leave his dormitory door, he heard Andiniya's call and couldn't help but turn back.

He saw the black cloak hanging down like a night sky, and Andiniya's coquettish and cute girl-like appearance, like a fleeting moment, deeply etched in Zhao Xu's memory.
