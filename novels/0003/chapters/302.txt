Chapter 303: Breaking the Mold

Players have spent two months interacting with NPCs and have become familiar with their interactions. However, the "tasks" they receive from NPCs are not mandatory and do not have any system-enforced consequences. As a result, some players have been deceived by the cunning and treacherous NPCs and have missed out on rewards.

This has led to complaints on the forum, which have become a daily topic of discussion. After this period of education, players have learned to summarize their experiences and have found that players with higher job levels and a tendency towards order or goodness are less likely to betray their tasks.

As a result, members of the Adventurer's Guild, who have witnessed the official identity of the Crazy Wind Mage, feel a sense of intervention in Arthur's key history. Players from the former Star Lake have been boasting about their achievement until today, as they have changed history. The game will record everything that happened on that day in the future Winter City and Star Lake.

Even the "Mysterious Pastor" and the "Starlight Reflection" statue, which have been created by the goddess of magic, have already been erected in Star Lake.

At this point, several people who had come together heard this and looked at Zhao Xu with eyes full of expectation, waiting for his next assignment.

As the president of the Frost Sword, he is one of the few players who have had dealings with the official authorities of Mistral City. He is very clear about the position of the "Rose Cross" in the violent department of Mistral City.
At this moment, when Zhao Xu presented the proof, he seemed to have no doubts and directly said with a respectful tone: "Mr. Feng, if there's any need, we'll all cooperate with your actions."

Zhao Xu then politely said, "No, it's I who bothered you. This mainly involves some clues that led me to a case about a devilish affair, and I'm unable to disclose more details due to confidentiality reasons. I just hope to receive your assistance when necessary."

Listening to Zhao Xu's explanation, Sheng Jian also relaxed his mind. Although he knew the reputation of "Rose Cross" wasn't too bad, it was unlikely to use its influence to intimidate them.

However, this time, Zhao Xu had indeed told the truth, and the seven notebooks were indeed related to the demonic bloodline event of the Andy family. He was also taking precautions in advance to prevent the notebooks from being tampered with.

At this moment, Chen Nu, the mage, wondered: "Mr. Feng, how did that trap disappear?"

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and said: "This is the effect of the two-ring spell 'Shadow Trap.' This spell has only one function: to mislead people into thinking that there's a trap on a lock or mechanical device."

"If you search for a trap or use the detect trap spell, you'll think there's a trap there. From door locks, window hinges, wooden plugs, and sealed covers to gears, all can apply this spell. However, in reality, this spell itself has no actual power and is simply a way to delay the solver's progress."

Sheng Jian suddenly slapped his forehead: "Ah, I understand now." It was as if he was the one who had asked the question.
Even if I had to take responsibility for the Frost Sword's actions, I wouldn't be able to do so.

On the online forum, there have been too many instances of players accidentally triggering traps and being trapped in a room, with no choice but to self-destruct and respawn. Each person in the room is carefully listening to Zhao Xu's explanation, which is an adventure in itself.

"However, Mr. Wild Wind, you just used a deactivation spell, didn't you?" Chen Nu remained puzzled.

Zhao Xu smiled, "This is a new development in magic over the past few years. If you re-cast the 'Shadow Trap' within a 15-meter range, it can replace the original spell. Therefore, after I cast the spell, the trap on the door lock disappeared, so I'm confident in this conclusion."

In reality, Zhao Xu couldn't cast the "True Knowledge" spell, so he didn't dare claim that the trap was fake.

The intelligence of the mages themselves allows them to set up traps that are extremely cunning, often considering various human reactions and countermeasures.

Zhao Xu once encountered a "Curse Tower" set up by the mage Lyin in the underground city, which was a live door trap that prevented them from retreating.

After receiving Zhao Xu's explanation, the two wanderers walked forward, taking out fine iron wire and hooks from their backpacks and using the "Deactivation Device" skill to open the door lock.

At this point, the Frost Sword had already put aside its concerns, but saw Chen Nu still frowning, and quietly approached him and whispered, "Is there anything unusual?"

Chen Nu replied cautiously, "What do you think, elder, about the usage of the 'Shadow Trap' spell?"

As soon as Shi Jian heard this, he almost burst out laughing, "This is completely outrageous, I never thought that the crazy wind mage would actually come up with a solution to the problem. Just look at everyone's gaze, they're all staring at him as if he's the strongest magical consultant. Originally, everyone thought that Zhao Xu only had strong magical equipment and didn't dare to underestimate him. But it's clear that he's not just a two-generation mage, and no one dares to underestimate his magical foundation.

Then he put forward his opinions on magic, even if Chen Nu disagreed, everyone would still listen to Zhao Xu more.

Chen Nu continued to say, "Leader, can you prepare such an unconventional magic? That's a two-ring, not a zero-ring."

Shi Jian suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, staring at Zhao Xu's back with an incredulous expression, unsure of what kind of divine power he possessed.

After that, the stone door creaked open slowly, revealing a larger hall with a four-square layout, very spacious.

The hall was about four meters high, with an extremely wide area that would take at least five or six seconds to run across. The walls and floor were made of the same green brick, with no gaps or anomalies.

Everyone slowly entered the hall, their eyes wandering around, but they couldn't find any strange marks. This completely uniform room was like a copied and pasted copy, making everyone lose focus.

"I'll use the detection secret door spell to search," Chen Nu said at this time, while the two nomads also began to search for clues on the site.

Zhao Xu glanced at Chen Nu and thought that this spell was probably prepared by him in advance for this occasion.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It's been a day since the calculation wizard learned the spell, and the guild released the task, so the Frost Sword has had at least two to three days of idle time to get the map. This means that the enemy may have had time to prepare for two to three days.

The Frost Sword had previously been stationed in Mistral City, with a watchtower and the goddess's altar, and ordinary people did not dare to take action on their own. Everyone started to descend, using their half-baked search skills to search, mainly because the area was too large, and it was difficult for two explorers to continue.

Zhou Xiu also didn't delay, and used the "Detection of Secret Portals" spell.

At this moment, Zhou Xiu's eyes flashed with a subtle electric light, as if his eyes were directly emitting a cone-shaped invisible light beam with a radius of 20 meters. Suddenly, the mysterious magical energy directly spread in front of him.

"Detection of Secret Portals" is a minute-level spell that requires focus, meaning he cannot release any other spells during this process.

Zhou Xiu, with his "Detection of Secret Portals" hand flashlight, basically determined the presence or absence of a secret portal in the first round. Then, in the second round, he could determine the specific number of secret portals. If there were any, he could analyze the status of each portal in the subsequent rounds.

When he first discovered the secret portal behind the devilish altar in that underground city, he realized that there was another secret portal there, otherwise, the altar would have been trapped and they would not have been able to search.

At this moment, Zhou Xiu switched to a new area every 6 seconds, and basically, any secret portal, secret room, or underground chamber would become transparent under the illumination of this spell.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu stopped in his tracks and stared straight ahead as Zhang Wang scanned the area. At first, when they were doing a tactical simulation, everyone understood that Zhao Xu had gained something, and they all turned their attention to the area he was staring at.

After a while, Zhao Xu raised his hand and pointed to a spot on the floor about five meters ahead, saying, "It's here."

The two wanderers hurried over and knelt down beside Zhao Xu, then lightly tapped the floor and examined the surrounding area, shaking their heads. "There's no echo, and we can't see any cracks in the door either," they said.

At this time, Chen Nu also moved to this location and said the same thing: "I also saw it, and it should be a door. It's a hidden door."

However, after opening the information feedback, Chen Nu's face turned difficult, saying, "We need to use the blood of the Ero family's direct descendants to remove the seal. Otherwiseâ€”"

"What will happen if we can't?" Frost Sword asked nervously.

The ancestors of the Ero family had long since passed away and were buried on the spot. At this time, where could they find blood to collect?

"This brick face has a sensing magic, and only family blood can block it. It's not that we can't break the brick with brute force, but if the force is uneven, the mechanism above will be triggered, and the deep well we came from will be sealed," Chen Nu said, looking stunned, as if he was receiving feedback from his detection magic.

At that moment, everyone felt a sense of great difficulty. Frost Sword was also surprised to find that there was such magical magic. The entire brick would not be destroyed with uniform force, and it would directly trigger a trap.
Here is the translation:

A veteran explorer who had worked on construction projects said, "If we were on Earth, we could probably use explosive drilling to crush it evenly."

"Don't be ridiculous, there's no way you could bring a drill here," another player countered.

Meanwhile, the mage, Zhao Xu, took a deep breath, furrowed his brow, and clearly ruled out the possibility of using brute force to break through the ground.

"What kind of spell can achieve this?" poet Ku Lu asked, who was also a skilled player.

"No way, I've heard that mages don't have a famous set of spells called 'Stone to Mud'?" a warrior asked.

"That's a five-ring spell, and it only works on natural stones. This is a magical stone, and it's no use anyway," Chen Nu said helplessly.

Hearing this, everyone realized that even the crazy wind mage behind them might not be able to solve the problem.

Zhao Xu was getting a headache.

He wasn't worried about how to break through the trap, but rather how to explain to everyone that he had deliberately prepared a very rare non-core spell. Zhao Xu could only sigh. If outside players knew that they could freely cast spells at will, the mage profession might go crazy.
