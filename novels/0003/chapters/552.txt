Chapter 553: The July Without God

"Can't get in," Chen Sīnán muttered to himself as he sat down and put on the "Brain Domain Helmet".

The usual smooth login process was disrupted this time, and he couldn't even enter the login interface before all connections were lost.

"Same as before, only able to enter the login interface, and then everything is disconnected," Chen Sīnán reported back.

"I'm going!"

"Disconnected!"

Suddenly, the adjacent dormitory also let out a strange, ghostly howl, a sound that was usually only heard when the school was closed or the power went out.

Countless players were plunged into a state of confusion.

Even players who had planned to stay up until 8:00 PM to watch Dong Chengyue's "key evidence" were confused.

At this moment, everyone forgot about Dong Chengyue's latest post, which was "garbled," and directly logged in to the game.

This was the first time in eight months since the game's launch that the "Arthas" service had been interrupted. The login interface's bright light did not turn on again.

The countdown timer that appeared during server downtime also disappeared.

"What about my account?" someone asked.

"This is an infringement!"

"I don't want a refund, I want to keep playing!"

"Arthas, you're a cheat, and so is TC."

"Was this planned in advance, or is Dong Chengyue's post just a 'spark' that ignited the fire?"

"Could it be real? Is it possible that there are supernatural forces at work, blocking this event from happening?"

At this moment, the entire forum was in an uproar.

The keyword "Arthas shutdown" instantly rose to the top of the hot search list.
Here is the translation of the text:

Countless players received the "shutdown" refund at this critical moment, each one separately. Meanwhile, a law expert appeared on the scene, analyzing the initial registration page's terms and conditions. It turned out that the TC family had the right to refund and terminate all game accounts in special circumstances. This clause can be debated, but taking it to court would be a protracted and arduous process.

Even when players carefully read the terms and conditions, they never thought this kind of refund would happen. Who would have expected that there would be an activation one day?

"Hey, what did you just want to say to me?" Zhang Qi asked curiously.

"No, nothing," Zhao Xiu shook his head.

He no longer needed to prove anything.

Zhao Xiu silently returned to the balcony.

As Lark had once told him that prophecies could not be written down, Zhao Xiu had believed it at the time. Moreover, due to the risk of prophecies, Zhao Xiu had never attempted to try anything related to them, fearing that it would alarm all the gods with fragments of destiny.

It was only later, in the depths of the Starfall Town, that people discovered the "monument" and saw the decoded prophecy written on it. He finally realized that "cannot be written down" was not just a metaphor.

Through the phone, he successfully conveyed the power of the prophecy to Wang Qingwei.

Later, he tried writing the prophecy on a post or paper, but found that there were no issues.

However, Zhao Xiu was cautious and did not publish the post, leaving it in the draft box instead.

At the time, he still thought it was a special phenomenon on "Earth".

It wasn't until tonight that he realized that the "constraint" was still in effect.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, he was about to announce this, but it would have no meaning at all.

Zhao Xù noticed that the plan might be different from what he had estimated beforehand, and he silently gazed at the dark sky deep in thought.

The area of the university town was not very far from the city, so the night was still affected by the city's air pollution, and it was impossible to see the countless stars like in rural areas.

At this moment, Zhao Xù was nervous, constantly glancing at his phone's time.

Waiting for the last moment to come.

"Brother Xu, you're not really thinking that there will be a meteor tonight, are you?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but walk out and pat Zhao Xù on the shoulder.

After half an hour, Zhang Qi finally calmed down and said, "Well, anyway, we have to live on. We can only curse the terrible operation of TC's game."

As he said this, he suddenly hugged Zhao Xù's shoulder tightly, "Hey, Ru Ru and the others are calling us to go to the big lawn outside. Our class association is also responding, and we plan to organize everyone to count down together."

"Count down?" Zhao Xù couldn't help but smile wryly, and his inner turmoil was alleviated to some extent.

"That's it, on the balcony, the effect is bad, and the rooftop is closed, so if there really is a meteor, we'll watch it together as it falls," Zhang Qi said.

"If there isn't, the class association group will probably cool down afterwards. It's unclear if everyone will switch to other games tomorrow."

As he spoke, Zhang Qi looked pitiful and said, "Let's just consider it the last goodbye. Ah, I finally managed to befriend Summer God, and I got a bunch of good equipment. But in the end, the game was shut down without me even getting to enjoy it."
Here is the translation of the text:

In the time between midnight and 12:00, it seemed as if the event "Arthur's silence" had become a tacit understanding among players. Even students from several schools, including Zhao Xu, gathered on the lawn of the football field, each bringing their own water, beer, snacks, and fruits, and a tablecloth. Normally, these people would be game partners, but now they just looked at each other, unsure of what to say. They could only gaze at the night sky together.

"If there really is a way to travel through time, I think it's not bad at all," said the class president of the neighboring class, who was still wearing his high school uniform, which he had worn since graduation. He was about to face the pressure of society, and the house and car he would inherit, which had recently caused him to be dragged into playing this game with his classmates.

"Don't think about it, class president," cautioned a student from the neighboring class. "If you say something like that, you'll definitely be roasted."

Zhao Xu recognized this student, who had already joined the local police force and was considered a promising candidate.

"It's really a bit uncomfortable without this game," said Cui Lu, who sat down beside Zhao Xu and his group.

"However, Zhao Xu, it's really a pity," said Cui Lu, taking a sip from a glass of champagne. Her face had already shown a hint of confusion.

Class President Fang Xinyue quickly came over to support her and scolded, "Lu Lu, don't drink too much, you're always getting drunk like this."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Earlier, Zhao Xu was teaching me to choose the archer's flow of patrol riders, not the dual sword flow," said Cui Lu, her face turning red as if she couldn't even tolerate low-level alcohol.

"How could this game just disappear like that?"

At this point, her coy pose also caught the attention of other men, making them feel a sense of shock and awe.

Zhang Qi also noticed his girlfriend, Feng Ge, staring at him, so he quickly pinched his thigh.

As for Zhao Xu, he remained as calm as ever.

Slowly, other classmates from the same class gathered to toast each other, sharing the names and occupations of King Arthur's knights, and bidding each other farewell.

Amidst the commotion, some students occasionally looked up at the sky, as if waiting for something.

The school's security team, meanwhile, had stationed two guards in a corner, worried that the students might suddenly go wild, smashing bottles and shouting, and then hold a procession.

It was the peak season for graduating seniors, and many were reminiscing about their time at school.

They were afraid that the restrictions might be too strict, causing a backlash.

The graduating seniors, who had just received their diplomas and were about to move out of the dorms, didn't have much to fear.

No matter how distant 12 o'clock seemed, it was still slowly approaching.

The students in attendance looked up at the sky more and more frequently.

Although few people believed the post about "Dong Cheng Rui" (a popular online forum).
But what if it were true?

As the countdown entered the last 30 minutes, the entire soccer match suddenly erupted into a chorus, from the vast sky to the brightest star in the night sky.

The chorus gradually ignited the atmosphere of the entire venue.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu's thoughts had already wandered over countless spells and incantations in his mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

The moment he arrived in the new world, he didn't stop his steps for a moment.

"Introduce yourself, Zhao Xu," said Cui Lu, suddenly turning around to face Zhao Xu, just as her gaming partners who had gathered around her had finished toasting her with a round of wine, making her face glow like a peach blossom.

Class monitor Fang Xi Yue was holding onto her tightly, as if she would collapse if she let go.

"Lu Lu, Starfall Town, 5th-level Ranger," said Cui Lu and Zhao Xu, with a hint of farewell to the game.

As the countdown timer reached its last 10 seconds, Zhao Xu turned back to look at the two of them, with the chorus already reaching its climax, and everyone shouting "Please shine a light on my path, brightest star in the night sky."

The sound waves had already muffled all the surrounding noise, making it difficult to hear.

"Zhong Xia, Starfall Town, 9th-level Mage," someone said, which made Cui Lu, even though she was already drunk, snap back to reality.

As for Fang Xi Yue, her mouth was wide open, as if she couldn't believe it.

"Tick-tock," went the clock.

The 12 o'clock alarm rang out as scheduled.

Zhao Xu turned back around, gazing at this black night that was as dark as ink, devoid of any human emotion.

He remained calm and serene, like a flowing stream.

The representative of the crossing comet, however, failed to appear as scheduled.
