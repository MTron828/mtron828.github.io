Chapter 531: The Leader's Power

As the old man stood facing Zhao Xu, he was gasping for breath, trying to calm his nerves. He looked around at the patrol team members beside him, noticing that they were also getting anxious. In an instant, he realized that if he didn't do something, the entire situation would be taken over by that mysterious man, and more patrol teams would intervene, making it impossible for him to cover it up.

Without hesitation, the old man gave a signal to the two burly men behind Zhao Xu, and then shouted, "You, a wandering performer who only knows a few tricks, dare to pretend to be a noble wizard?"

As soon as the Wizard Association's base was established in Falling Star Town, the immense investment in both finances and manpower, as well as the gradual transformation of the area into a hub outside the mining district, made residents realize the profound influence of the Wizard Association. In other words, they began to understand that a "wizard" was not just a mere entertainer who could only cast a few spells.

The drunkard in the tavern was a warrior, and the great leader in the capital was also a warrior. They were like apples and oranges, and couldn't be compared.

After shouting this, the old man suddenly grabbed the corners of the tablecloth and, without a care about the broken bottles and spilled liquids, prepared to leave. Meanwhile, he pulled out a dagger and whispered to Zhao Xu, "Be smart and don't cause trouble."

As he waved his dagger in front of him, he attempted to block Zhao Xu's waist.
Here is the translation of the text:

That spot is where a man's kidneys are located. No matter who is stabbed there, the rest of their life won't be easy.

Another person is opening his arm, preparing to strangle Zhao Xu and tell him to stop talking nonsense.

Zhao Xu sees that several people are still trying to clumsily cover the hot water kettle, completely unaware that they will get burned.

He says in a weak voice that only the two burly men behind him can hear, "Although one may hold the power of a leader, it doesn't mean I can kill and take away lives on this land."

"But it's not for you to offend," he says.

As Zhao Xu says this, he suddenly charges at the man with the dagger. The other party is almost startled, thinking it's some kind of reverse psychology.

But the next second, his face turns white.

He looks at the dagger in his hand, which has been sharpened day and night to an unparalleled sharpness. Suddenly, he feels a strange sensation.

Force armor!

Only a legitimate wizard can possess such an ability!

The opponent is definitely not some juggler who only knows tricks!

"Ah!"

At this moment, the burly man who was trying to strangle Zhao Xu suddenly realizes that he, who has confidently grasped the arms of countless travelers, is now being grabbed by this mysterious man.

He doesn't move an inch.

"A snap!"

The next moment, a cracking sound is heard.

"Don't think you can bully people just because you're strong. That's just because you haven't met someone stronger yet."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's physical strength exceeds that of an ancient dragon, and he also has the qualification to say "clucking nonsense".

But he hasn't finished speaking when the two patrolling team members see the two men who were trying to control Zhao Xu suddenly collapse.

Even the mysterious glow that represented magic has vanished.
Here is the translation:

"Hold it, get down, raise your hands, and bow your head." The patrol team leader suddenly became tense and shouted loudly, saying words that the townspeople would not follow.

"Biu---" At the same time, his teammate blew the whistle to call for help.

It's one thing to have a reason, but it's another thing to have a conflict with the patrol team.

Even with a reason, there may not be a reason.

The old man, who had already retreated three or four steps, was also satisfied with the scene, realizing that his thoughts had been implemented, and thanks to the cooperation of this young man.

He had to teach his opponent a lesson. Sometimes, a fist does not represent everything.

Among the crowd of onlookers, there were also adventurers, and a few old hands who had walked the streets for many years and had discovered the underlying reasons and began to teach their teammates how to respond to such a situation.

"In the wild, we would naturally draw our knives and slash, but in the city, you have to follow the rules of the city, even if you are a chaotic and evil villain. You have to act within this invisible order, and you can even take advantage of it."

"Are you going to surrender?"
"Will you give up a piece of meat? We can still walk on this land, and the justice of Arthur's light has never disappeared. Wait until there are more people, and then you can explain the reason. This small town is still under the rule of the Northern Alliance. Why did the old scoundrel flee?"

"It's too suffocating."
"That's okay, if you can crush the strong ones in this small town with your ability, you can play freely. But after that, you'll have to deal with the strong ones from the big city, and even the ones from the capital of Orol."

Here is the translation of the text:

As the experienced adventurer spoke, he looked at himself and said with a satisfied tone: "By that time, what's right or wrong doesn't matter. You've slapped the face of the alliance, which is a big deal."

"Not that serious, is it?" the female adventurer next to him asked, unable to understand.

"Of course not," he replied. "It's precisely because everyone is busy that the first to take action will be met with a decisive counterattack. Otherwise, they'll all flee in the end. This guy will cause a big commotion afterwards, and unless he's found to have no connection to the alliance, he'll have a hard time appearing openly in the alliance."

"Don't believe him," the team leader of this small team said, looking at him disapprovingly. "The alliance has many unresolved enemies, and the situation he's describing only arises when both sides engage in fierce battles, resulting in casualties. It's more likely that this guy will take down the patrol team and then have the town's high-ranking officials intervene to settle the matter, or he won't be able to escape."

"When that time comes, it's up to the gods," he said, looking at the team leader. "Who knows what kind of identity the other party has."

As he looked at his team leader, the old and weathered adventurer refused to back down, "Little girl, this is what the team leader is thinking."

"This is different from the past," he said. "We're in Starlight Town, which is an ordinary town. Under normal circumstances, this method wouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many unresolved cases. But now, Starlight Town has become a miraculous place due to the magic light descending from above."

"You've been slapped in the face by the town, and as long as you seek help from our nominal 'leader', who will prioritize the town's interests, they will naturally take action. With the aid of the mage's magic, where can you escape to?"

After half a month of exposure and immersion, even this newly minted adventurer's face turned pale.
Here is the translation of the text:

She has already understood that the "frost beam" used by those players, or the "dizziness technique" that makes people dizzy, are not the true abilities of a mage. "This is where the fear lies, where mages and the violent class become one. You haven't noticed that the ruffians in the small town have been cautious lately?" The 40-year-old adventurer stroked his well-groomed beard, "The mage who stayed in the wooden tower has the ability to track with the 'biological positioning technique'."

"That's how it is," the young adventurer said with a hint of sadness. "I didn't expect that even after proving it, there were no good results."

"This is the best outcome, which is that he and the officials of this small town have a connection," he said.

"You just need to be the face of this small town, and others will naturally protect you," he added.

The team leader, a warrior with a scar on her chin, spoke up, "Don't take what he says seriously, it's just a trap."

Meanwhile, a player beside him was excitedly watching the scene, thinking about when to intervene.

"The team leader, it seems that this is a true mage, and we should recruit him," a half-armor-clad warrior said in a low tone.

"Let's observe for now," the warrior who was called the team leader said, a woman with a scar on her chin, "These mages are always so arrogant, not allowing anyone to be defeated. We don't even have the opportunity to negotiate."

"Ha ha, who would have thought that we would have the chance to see such a dramatic show while passing through the Starfall Town," a wanderer with a sharp knife said, "Maybe we can even add one more member to our team of five."

No one in the group looked favorably at the mysterious man before them.
As the sound of the whistle echoed, the nearby patrol teams slowly began to converge and provide support. Compared to other impoverished patrol teams, the Starfall Town patrol team had already started to wear standard-issue leather armor. This would not significantly impede their mobility while providing sufficient defense.

"Put down your weapons and let's explain," a spectator who couldn't bear to watch said.

"How did this happen?" the patrol team leader from the nearby district scolded, and the members who had been facing off against Zhao Xu immediately moved closer and whispered to him.

As the patrol team leader, Jeff, listened to the embellished description, his brow furrowed slightly, but he then looked at the mysterious man in front of him with a more serious expression.

Although Zhao Xu was wearing a robe, the robe had been worn by a player mage, and its gold content had decreased significantly. Moreover, the "Summer" in Starfall Town was a player mage, and even if the man in front of him was a true mage, their interests might not be aligned.

Especially since big shots would be coming to the town today, he didn't want to stir up trouble.

After some thought, Jeff had thought through the benefits and drawbacks of the entire process.

Through the material of the robe, he realized that this might not be a fake costume.

However, he wasn't too worried.

If the man in front of him was truly a mage above the third circle, a "noble," he would already be exuding an air of superiority, or at least wouldn't be able to afford a servant.

The situation should still be within his control.

He was better off not asking the other side.

Sometimes, it's better not to know and not to confirm, so he wouldn't take any "responsive" actions.
The patrol leader glared at his subordinates and then turned to Zhao Xu, saying, "Since you didn't suffer any losses, let's disperse." "That's right," someone in the crowd suddenly chimed in.

As someone who has lived at the bottom of society, they know that swindlers can operate openly on the same land, as long as they have a backing. If they really get reported to the authorities, these behind-the-scenes backers can also come out and hit them with a 50-strike penalty, saying that no substantial loss was caused and releasing both parties.

Even without basic detention, these swindlers can save time and quickly find their next victim.

"Wow, they guessed it wrong," said the experienced adventurer, shaking his head, "It's not possible, the Lord of the Summer has only been here for less than a month, and the entire Starfall Town is so peaceful? I suspect something, and it's possible that the opponent has discovered this is a real wizard."

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile and say, "The old man still has the exchange coupon for 300 gold coins in his hand."

"According to the laws of Starfall Town, swindling more than 5 gold coins will be prosecuted. This matter can no longer be explained as a misunderstanding. You must give me a mediation result."

As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd suddenly realized that the old man, who had initially thought he had gained 300 gold coins, had actually become the one who needed to face the "evidence" of his crime.

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at the patrol leader with a gaze that was slightly tinged with mockery.

Yesterday, he was surrounded by the townspeople when he first arrived, and it was a certain identity.

Now, he is another identity.

The patrol leader seemed to see the ridicule in Zhao Xu's gaze and realized that his plan had been exposed, and his heart suddenly became angry.
Here is the translation of the text:

He is not someone who knows what's good and bad, and if there isn't a big shot, he wouldn't dare to cause trouble. Otherwise, he would definitely take off the skin of the other party. He took a glance at the other party's age and thought that it wouldn't be someone powerful like a wizard. Even if it was a wizard who didn't match the age, he wouldn't have anything to fear.

But then he noticed a dignified figure standing on the high tower. "Not a Three-Ring Wizard?" he asked, slightly lowering his head.

The moment he asked, all the players who were expecting a thrilling battle felt a sense of disappointment.

"This is not a Three-Ring Wizard," Zhao Xu replied with a shake of his head.

The crowd in the room was stunned.

The patrol team leader, Jeff, directly asked, "Are you a Two-Ring Wizard?"

"No," Zhao Xu continued to shake his head.

The crowd in the room was even more disappointed.

Someone said, "It looks like this wizard isn't as strong as he claims to be."

Another person added, "What's going on? This wizard isn't even a regular wizard."

Someone else remarked, "He's just a cheater. Black and white don't matter when you're with people like him. You can't rely on reason to win."

"But isn't there a Holy Temple of Good in the city?" someone asked.

"But Starfall Town doesn't have a temple," someone else pointed out. "And reason doesn't always apply in a small town. Besides, even if you go to the big city, there are many twists and turns."
Here is the translation of the text:

As for some capable adventurers, they are looking at these things with a hint of numbness, and for them, it's only by crashing into the wall that they can grow up.

Jeff, the patrol team leader who understands Zhao Xu's strength, feels that he no longer needs to ask any further questions, and that it's already clear that there's no difference between a novice or an apprentice.

He slightly lifted his gaze, "If you're going to make a decision, let's all go to the public security office together."

As he spoke, he glanced at the two burly men, "Take them away as well. In Starfall Town, even if someone gets hurt, there's a 'compensation' to be paid."

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was amused by the case of one ring linking to another.

As for the wind and him from his past life, there wasn't much of a difference.

"This one code, you can definitely collect the most basic evidence on the scene, including these eyewitnesses."

As he spoke, Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the crowd that had gathered at the scene, but the civilians had naturally taken a step back, and only the players remained standing, showing no concern about playing the role of witnesses.

"Why, do we have to go to the public security office without asking a single detail and just drag us away?" Zhao Xu asked in response.

He was clearer than the man in front of him about the entire public security protocol.

Suddenly, the team leader Jeff became angry, "Am I handling the case or are you?"

"Arrest him and take him away!"

In an instant, Zhao Xu smiled slightly.

The jurisdiction of Starfall Town's public security had already fallen into his hands.

Zhao Xu had been handling everything in a straightforward and official manner throughout, without any domineering or dictatorial tone, and had been politely asking for an "explanation".

So, it was not the people in front of him who were going to give him an explanation.
The management team of the "Falling Star Town" wanted to explain the situation to him.

The patrol team leader gave a single order, and the patrol team members surrounding Zhao Xu rushed towards him, their faces filled with malice. However, the nearby players looked on in disgust but did not intervene, only shouting insults.

Testifying is one thing, but arresting is another.

People who have experienced civilized society's public power are clearer about not taking rash action, as it will only lead to a disadvantageous situation.

Public power has always been a double-edged sword, and each time it is used, it will dull its edge against enemies, leaving only the sharp edge facing oneself.

Then, everything returned to normal.

However, Zhao Xu did not use any magical control over the patrol team members rushing towards him.

He simply raised his staff, aiming at the patrol team leader's waist, and a beam of hot energy shot out, instantly.

Patrol team leader Jeff was taken aback, shouting "You're crazy!" as he prepared to dodge.

He thought back to the mages' beam magic, feeling anxious about what kind of beam he might be hit with.

But the next moment, he realized that the signal flare on his waist had already been ignited, burning fiercely.

Suddenly, a blue-purple smoke rose into the air.

Countless warning signals erupted.

Jeff was shocked to discover that the signal smoke bomb he had to pull the trigger to activate had been so easily ignited by the enemy, and he was filled with anger towards this mysterious man.
Here is the translation of the text:

He shouted loudly: "Take him down quickly!"

However, the patrol team member under his command suddenly discovered that no matter how he tried to strike with his weapon, it would always slide away coincidentally.

No one was hit.

Suddenly, thick smoke rolled in from afar, and the elite team originally stationed in the mining area also arrived on the scene. At this time, the town's current law enforcement official, Kaiqi, was sitting beside him.

When Patrol Team Leader Jeff saw the two of them, he exclaimed with joy, "Commander, there is a violent anti-law sorcerer here, who disregards our law enforcement agency and refuses to accept investigation."

Facing this scene, Zhao Xu lightly removed his hat.

In an instant, the two high-ranking officials of the town also changed color.

Instantly, the law enforcement official, Kaiqi, stood up and walked quickly towards the front, while Jeff was about to approach, but was pushed away by someone.

As all eyes in the room were fixed on him, the law enforcement official bent down and said humbly in a respectful tone: "Glory returns to the Alliance, greetings to you, my lord."
