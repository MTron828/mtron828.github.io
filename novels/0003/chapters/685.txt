Chapter 686: Ernest's Secret?

The 10-point strength limit for lifting weights is around 100 pounds. With each additional 10 points, the scale increases fourfold. According to Olympic records of over 400 pounds, these weightlifting champions are terrifying entities with over 20 points of strength.

Zhao Xuyu, with 53 points of strength, is undoubtedly a 20-ton weightlifting scale. He can casually deliver a punch that reaches the level of "shaking mountains and causing earthquakes" and can even "split rocks and extract gold". A slight movement of his shoulder could cause the bones to shatter and sink into the ground like a nail.

The opponent is at least 800 tons in size, equivalent to some luxurious cruise ships. If it weren't for his incredible defense, he would likely be sent flying and crash into the wall.

However, in his mind, Zhao Xuyu is already filled with the last sentence spoken by the opponent:

"As a city created by Ernest?"

This is indeed a city.

Any ordinary object that comes into contact with Ernest will transform into an endless horror, difficult to imagine.

Thinking back to the mysterious world he encountered in his dream, the beautiful and terrifying world of "Narya", Ernest's abilities may have been learned in that world.

Zhao Xuyu's heart is filled with caution.

"City? Is it not a living underground?" Zhao Xuyu says, causing the opponent's mind to become restless.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the incantation "迅捷爆发" reached the edge of his lips, he asked, "Live or die?"

Just then, the mysterious voice from the void suddenly stopped and asked, "Have you seen it, Old Master? Is this trash from the lowest level?"

"No, you have a familiar aura on your body," he said.

Before Zhao Xu could respond, the void voice grew angry, "If there's no corresponding bloodline, it's definitely a thief!"

"It's no wonder I recognize the cloak on your body!"

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have successfully dodged the "Restriction Technique".】
【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have successfully dodged the "Restriction Technique".】

For a moment, Zhao Xu saw his dynamic panel flash with multiple lines.

Fortunately, his willpower was extremely resilient, and he quickly distributed his luck points evenly, constantly increasing his defensive barrier.

Seeing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but curse.

Is this kind of trickery?
He suddenly cast "Restriction Technique" over and over again, as if he were a child throwing mud at home?
And what about the magical resistance provided by his Sage's Robe?
How did it disappear?
Zhao Xu had become so calm and composed, like a saint, that he couldn't imagine there were such extraordinary creatures beyond the norm.

Although "Restriction Technique" is a defensive spell, it is also a confinement spell, located at the pinnacle of the nine rings.
If the dodge fails, it will cause a false death state, and the victim will be buried in a small sphere far from the surface.
Until someone passes by the location where the "Restriction Technique" was cast and casts the "Release Technique" from the nine rings.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if the wish-granting technique cannot rescue the hostages, it can only know the location of the hostages. The giant who wanted to fight for the notebook with Zhao Xu is still buried deep in the earth near the Star Lake, unseen by the sun.

As for the legendary creature that exists above 96HD, it has the ability to "imprison" and can release the binding technique twice a day. It's like this now, and the UFO racing has become a storm of needles.

However, Zhao Xu's thoughts are still clear in his mind. He quickly grabbed the key point.

Breath!
Cloak!
"Wait, my celestial cloak is not mine to take," Zhao Xu said urgently.

"It's not theft if it's a gift," he said.

Zhao Xu had previously suspected that the guardian of the lost treasure of the Itelian Empire, which An Tiya brought him to, was a living cave.

The living cave is a level 33 challenge, a legendary super-giant construct. It was created by an extremely powerful mage to store and protect their treasures for many years.

The first-level protective unit can create a space of over 100 cubic meters. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to kill and can use isolation techniques and interdimensional transmission energy to become invisible, avoiding various visual and magical effects. It can also teleport to a random location in the starry sky.

However, only the owner can summon it using the short message technique, and it will return and become solid.

The problem is that living caves usually only respond to their owners, so no one can enter their storage. They also cannot be deceived by fake creatures, let alone shape-shifting or illusion magic.
From the day of its birth, various hardships began to accumulate as a preventive measure against the thief wizard. It wasn't until later that a vulnerability in the cloning technique was discovered. Just as Zhao Xu was analyzing the details of this biological creature that seemed to be alive, the other party began to mock him.

"Who are you? What's your face for?"

"Are you daring to flirt with my cousin, An Ti Nuo Ya?"

"She gave it to you, why don't you say she's your wife?"

"You're beautiful, don't think you're beautiful."

As the city constructor spoke, he seemed to regain his strength, taunting Zhao Xu for three minutes with biting words. Zhao Xu, who had been maintaining a modest and refined demeanor, had not expected to encounter a talkative person who revealed no useful information.

Is it an enemy or a friend?

Zhao Xu's mind whirled with questions.

The "Human Nature" spell, which he had prepared to use, was held up and put down again in his hand.

The constructed body was difficult to handle, mainly because this biological creature was carrying a lot of immunity.

The "Human Nature" spell, as its name suggested, could make the constructed body accept medical subjugation. However, the price was that it would lose immunity to effects such as knockback, sneak attack, non-lethal damage, stun, attribute damage, attribute absorption, and instant death.

Thus, Zhao Xu had many options against it.

"It's indeed An Ti Nuo Ya who gave it to me," Zhao Xu said with a disdainful tone, shaking off his backpack. "Do you think someone can snatch things from the teacher's hands?"

As Zhao Xu shouted loudly, the sound waves seemed to resonate, causing the surrounding stones to crumble and fall.
Here is the translation of the text:

Constructing a life corresponds to mysterious knowledge.
Zhao Xu is not just someone who can easily solve problems, he actually used the "scroll scholar's" dark knowledge: tactical ability, revealing the secrets of constructing a life body's fear.
This can give him a "battle advantage".
If the opponent truly has a close relationship with An Ti Nuo Ya, they will naturally know the "dark knowledge" of the scroll scholar, and will also recall that An Ti Nuo Ya is also a scroll scholar.
As an organization with a small number of members, Zhao Xu believes that this speculation is reasonable.
If the opponent can't even think of it, it can only be said that the relationship is not deep enough, and it will continue to fight to the death.
"Oh?" At this time, the constructed city let out a puzzled voice.
"Is it really you, the lady, who took the cloak from my fragmented body?"
"Impossible? My life is about to collapse."
"Ah, it's really you, wearing that robe, which was previously worn by the lady. It seems that the relationship is quite profound, I'm so ashamed."
As the constructed city continued to mutter to itself, as if it had entered a linguistic dead end and couldn't get out of it for a while.
"Fragmented body?" Zhao Xu noticed this point of difference.
He smiled playfully, "Are you going to tell me that you are the true body of Ernest's secrets?"
"There is a treasure trove of secrets hidden in your body that was once searched by King Arthur."
"Oh, that's right, unfortunately, no reward."
