Chapter 672 Negotiation Strategy

At some point, Arthur's death was just a decrease in the "resurrection stone" count on the character panel.

When all five were used up, causing the entire player account to reset, many people would surely feel extremely heartbroken, and some might even lose their appetite for days.

Some, holding their breath, would stop playing this game altogether, leading to a complete separation, and quitting the game directly.

However, the wheel of life will still move forward, leaving behind traces that are at most just a part of life's experiences, and time is enough to smooth out all scars.

As important as the game may be, life still has to go on.

Until, that is, humans cross over.

At this moment, a body falling down is no longer just a change in numbers, but the passing of a living life!

Cook and a group of more than ten people, at the moment when a heavy rainstorm was about to come, still had to leave the city to take risks. The fundamental reason was that they were not as prepared as other players, and they simply did not have enough food.

Because of the fear of death, they did not take enough risks in the early stages of crossing, so the easily accessible areas had already been occupied.

Because of the fear of death, they did not courageously join the big battles, so naturally they did not get any battle rewards.

So they could only continue forward like the old farmers who go into the mountains to chop wood in the cold winter, forced by life. They knew they might freeze to death, but they could only continue forward.

The vast majority here were extremely conservative in the early stages, and only reluctantly left the city at the moment when a heavy rainstorm was about to come.

They had no choice but to continue forward, with no retreat left!

When the undead wave broke out, Zhao Xu directly attracted the goddess's attack, and certainly saved the entire human population.
But this also means that there are still many players who have not been pushed to the brink of life and death! The members of this team are essentially more afraid of death, whether it's their nature, their family, or their children, there are countless reasons.
But when the dull sound of the wanderer falling to the ground came, along with Zheng Xinyun's calm words!
After the initial enthusiasm was extinguished, the original reason slowly filled their bodies.
It slowly shattered the courage of the people, turning it into nothing!
Especially for those 1st level players who did not have their willpower improved at the beginning of their careers, seeing someone being nailed to death made their legs shake.
When people see a corpse, they easily imagine themselves becoming a corpse and feel sad.
In an instant, several members thought about changing direction and escaping first.
Everyone has someone they can't let go of, and reasons to escape from life. For their families, they can come out and take risks, and for their families, they can also become cowards without hesitation.
Zhao Xu still observed coldly as if he were an outsider.
Or maybe he was watching Zheng Xinyun's actions.
"I am a priest, you cover me, I will go up and check if he is still alive."
In the end, considering the importance of human life, Xinyun decisively walked forward with furrowed brows.
After the wanderer fell to the ground, the trap was not triggered again, which meant that the area where he fell was safe.
Of course, if the trap setter was more cunning and set it to trigger only with the weight of two people, Xinyun would still be at a disadvantage.
But this was a remote mountainous area, not an underground dungeon where clever traps could be laid out slowly. There could be exploration teams at any time, so the most likely traps to appear were simple ones that were not afraid of damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

The remaining few people in the team looked around in confusion, quickly pulling out their weapons and following Zheng Xin'er behind her. The people behind them, such as Patrol Lin, quietly drew their bows and arrows to provide cover.

However, only Zhao Xu seemed a bit dazed.

My silly kid, have you forgotten that you haven't asked for divine power from the team's strength today? Even Zheng Xin'er might have forgotten what divine powers she has.

In particular, after Zhao Xu revealed his identity in the camp, no one dared to ask or bother Zheng Xin'er to use her healing magic or other abilities.

A white-robed priest, leading a group of people forward, is this not a death sentence?

The thought suddenly popped into Zhao Xu's mind.

The three arrows all hit, and the wounded person was pierced through and through. A 2nd-level 10-attribute wanderer was basically just like a shrimp stuck on a bamboo stick, completely dead.

It was as if the wanderer had already declared his own death the moment he failed to dodge a single arrow.

Zhao Xu used a "healing light wound" and forcibly lifted the wounded person, barely managing to avoid death.

Therefore, from a rational perspective, in this uncertain environment where the enemy's intentions are unclear, they should have retreated immediately and given up advancing.

Instead of trying to retrieve a corpse.

The trap had knocked them down, and the enemy was telling them that the prey was within reach.

But at this moment, Zheng Xin'er was moving forward, facing the bleak sunlight and biting cold wind, her eyes filled with determination and courage, as if she had already transcended life and death.

Slowly, she finally reached the side of what seemed to be a corpse and stretched out her hand to feel the wanderer's pulse. Suddenly, her face lit up with surprise and she exclaimed, "He's not dead yet! We need to rush to administer first aid and help him stabilize his injuries!"

As she spoke, Zheng Xin'er finally came back to her senses, realizing that she still had Zhou Jun, a fellow team member.
At this moment, a phrase from Zhao Xu's previous words surged into her mind.

Everything today is for her to temper herself and to have the ability to persevere in the depths and wait for rescue.

Therefore, in essence, Zhao Xu does not intervene in any rescue mission.

If he really wants to save more people, it would be more effective to directly open the wireless transmission and wireless food production.

Zheng Xin'an's eyes became somewhat red, and she whispered softly, "Save them, okay?"

At this point, Zhao Xu finally understood.

Zheng Xin'an was not forgetting his existence or that he was a big leg, but rather, when she saw someone dying, she really forgot everything and just wanted to save people.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but slap his forehead.

As expected, Zheng Xin'an's character of saving the dying and the wounded had not changed over the centuries.

However, benevolence is not a spirit conducive to deep-sea adventures, otherwise, the high mortality rate of saint warriors would not be the case.

At this moment, a distant haze appeared in the field of vision, as if a rolling cloud of smoke had risen, and the originally quiet earth also began to vibrate slightly.

However, most people were only attracted by the roar and smoke, while Zhao Xu, with his extraordinary perception, sensed the earth's tremors.

"Retreat first!"

Warrior player Big Hammer also regained his composure and gave an order directly.

"It's too late!"

Suddenly, a female player let out a mournful cry.

Because at this moment, the shadow in the sky had arrived and quickly swept over their heads.

Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind howled in the air.

The shadow that covered the sky did not stop flying overhead!
Here is the translation of the text:

As I looked up, I saw a massive dragon with two wings hovering in the sky, its mouth filled with sharp, pointed teeth. Its tail ended with a thick, soft bone, covered with what looked like scorpion-like venomous stingers! The creature's length was only about five meters, with its wingspan reaching six meters. However, its loud, crocodilian roar sent shivers down everyone's spine.

"What's going to happen? I don't want to die!" someone exclaimed.

"Mom, sorry!" someone else apologized.

In an instant, the people who had been eager to escape had lost their courage and given up on their escape plan.

This dragon, which was almost as big as a large dragon, was more than enough to sweep through our small group, killing everyone one by one without any mercy.

"This is a two-legged flying dragon, not a giant dragon," stood out from the crowd, Zhao Xu. "The two-legged flying dragon, also known as the Pterodactyl, is only 6 levels strong, a mere trash."

The large dragon, with 60 HP, was no match for Zhao Xu's extreme dual-fireball spell.

However, it was likely to be enough to wipe out everyone except Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu had a nagging question in his mind.

Even if Cao Cao said that Cao Cao would come, this sudden appearance was a bit exaggerated.

Were they being distracted by something?

Zhao Xu even noticed earlier that a group of two-legged flying dragons was flying towards us from the distance, at least a score strong.

As a species, two-legged flying dragons are sometimes partners of human-eating monsters and giants, and sometimes they even serve as makeshift flying vehicles. But this was too coincidental.

Zhao Xu suddenly opened his mouth and shouted using the amplification spell.

"What are you doing in the sky, you Pterodactyls?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Although Zhao Xu spoke elegantly, he is also the most standard dragon language expert, with only 6 points of intelligence, making it not too easy to understand this native language. This is what he wants to teach to Yu'er.

Sometimes, a situation that seems inevitable can still be resolved through negotiation. However, the sky's dual-winged dragon did not respond, and it continued to glide at an extremely low altitude, as if demonstrating something.

The people in the small team also noticed the abnormality in the sky, all staring blankly.

Until several seconds later, a cold and stern voice came from high above.

"Human adventurers, it is I who ask you, why have you entered our territory?"
This time, the language used is the standard common language.

The common language, which is being vigorously promoted in the current Earth human classroom, is a language that can be used in various dimensions. Just like the English teaching of the past, where countless people knew that the "common language" was an essential subject that everyone had to learn before the Earth's influence rose.

The situation is more urgent than ever, and Earth humans must integrate into the Arthurian world. It is natural that they must learn Arthur's language, use Arthur's text, and re-travel the path of rise.

Even some determined people comfort themselves by saying that sacrificing rest time and sleep to learn Arthur's common language is for the sake of their descendants, so they won't have to learn it again.

Only by breaking through the language barrier can one perform the most basic communication.

At this moment, the team members are all players who have been injected with a large amount of "common language" knowledge since crossing over. Compared to the past, when players could only rely on automatic translation in the game, the current players have naturally mastered a language.

Of course, everyone understands this sentence.

But how did the adventure team, which had just successfully opened up this place two days ago, become a monster territory with a master?
During the process of the dragon's diagonal slash, everyone finally got a glimpse of the biological features on the dragon's back - two people-eating demons!

Zhao Xu even instantly noticed the signs, one being a demon sorcerer and the other a wild man-eating demon!

The demon sorcerer can be said to be a special branch of the demon species, with their entire body covered in blue skin, which is caused by long-term use of magical abilities.

The demon sorcerer in Arthur is also notorious for being able to freely cast dark magic, invisibility, and sudden attacks, and can knock out the brain with a single stick.

As for the other daily use of charms, shape-shifting, ice spike, sleep, and gasification, all of which are top-grade magic spells, not to mention the unblockable special abilities of flight and regeneration.

It's incredible that they are all above 10th level?

The ordinary people-eating demons speak in common language, and only those with an IQ above 10 can use common language.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but look at his own team, and the board they had just kicked was hard enough.

If he didn't intervene, the three monsters could slaughter the small team below and come back with more.

The two demon sorcerers, as advanced beings, had already transcended the ordinary people-eating demons, relying solely on their pure instincts.

After noticing Zhao Xu's existence, the wild man-eating demon directly controlled the dragon's descent, keeping his gaze fixed on Zhao Xu throughout the process.

"We are just passing adventurers and don't intend to offend you,"

As a demon with some intelligence, it's still above 10th level, and belongs to the category that can communicate.

Zhao Xu continued to demonstrate the "exchange" effect to Zheng Xin.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't rely on flattery to make two demons bow their heads and walk away, how can he show off his abilities? Of course, if the two demons don't cooperate with his performance, Zhao Xu doesn't care if there are two more demon corpses buried here.

At the same time, he will also take the opportunity to purify himself, so as not to become a demon skull.

If Zheng Xin Yu really gets lost in the depths, the demon's true nature is also an object that can be communicated with.

Although the chaotic nature is difficult to control, as long as one shows enough value, the demon still understands how to protect the chips in one's hand.

Seeing something unpleasant, directly pulling out the sword to attack is the privilege of the strong, even Zhao Xu, who only reaches the 9th level afterwards.

As for ordinary people, to survive well in this world where danger lurks around every corner, one must adapt to the situation, use one's words reasonably, and that is the true path.

After all, not everyone can become Zhao Xu.

"Hah! You wretched stranger!" the demon wizard, holding a giant wild beast bone as a staff, shouted angrily, "You dare to steal our tribe's sacred treasure, do you think a casual explanation can make up for it?"

The fire of anger in his eyes had already overflowed, ready to burst out at any moment.

"Even if you obediently hand over the sacred treasure and offer a hundred boys and girls to our gods as a sacrifice, it won't be enough to appease this anger!"

The wizard seemed to be getting more agitated, his wooden staff flying wildly in his hand, looking like it could strike Zhao Xu's head at any moment.

Gods?
Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrowed slightly."
