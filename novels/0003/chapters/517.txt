Chapter 518: The Real Culprit of Infection

Detective Zhao's eyes sparkled as he gazed at the faint glow emanating from the corner of the room. However, he found nothing unusual, no signs of supernatural activity or hidden magic. It was as if there was no such thing as a vampire.

Suddenly, a loud shout echoed from the entrance of the inn. The crowd of people lining the corridor began to disperse as a group of patrolling guards, led by a tall and slender warrior, pushed their way through. The warrior, still rubbing the sleep from his eyes, gazed at the corpse and his expression turned serious. "Has the coroner been notified?" he asked.

"Not yet," replied the innkeeper, looking anxious.

For the guards, a brawl resulting in death was one thing, but a murder case would require significant resources to investigate. The players gathered in the tavern below, sipping their drinks, had no idea that the inn above would be the scene of a murder. They, too, joined in the excitement, each using their knowledge of earth sciences to analyze the case.

However, the patrol team leader remained unfazed, silently taking in the scene and memorizing the faces of the people present. He was thinking of possible suspects. Meanwhile, some locals who had become friends over a few rounds of drinking and eating, carrying beer cups, went to greet the guards, asking about the latest news.

Vivian stood silently behind Zhao Xu, suppressing the urge to use her "detect evil" ability.

As for Serus, he was listlessly surveying the scene before him. To be blunt, death was a commonplace occurrence in this frozen mountain range. A few people would die, and every day would bring a funeral procession. "You humans are really dramatic, always making a big deal out of everything," Serus complained to Zhao Xu.

To be honest, they had just finished disposing of a vampire's body, and now they were staring at a human corpse, with people screaming in shock. Serus's mind was a bit muddled.

"You need to take a look at your location," Zhao Xu said. "You're currently in a human town. If you were in our world, this would be even more exaggerated."

Zhao Xu explained the situation to Serus, but suddenly his mind turned, and his eyes grew sharp.

Something that could leave a blood hole in the neck wasn't necessarily a vampire.

At this point, the coroner had also arrived at the scene in the middle of the night, having left his warm bed. The crowd surrounding the body hadn't dispersed, and the patrol team had finished investigating the scene before collecting the body.

"Look at the body's position where it fell, and the marks on the ground," someone said. "There's an unnatural mark here, definitely made by the deceased before they died."

A player who had stayed up late at a hotel commented.

"You're assuming they knew each other."

Another person immediately refuted him.

"Wait, even if they didn't know each other, you can still draw out the killer's features," a few people who had come together concluded.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're incredible, you can show me what kind of human features can be seen from this wound."

"It's not definite, it's just a figurative expression."

"You're just making a mess."

The forensic expert, who was listening to the players' argument, was increasingly frustrated and finally interrupted, "Quiet down!"

This finally stopped the argument.

After re-examining the wound, he nodded and concluded, "I think this is..."

"Mouse." Suddenly, a half-elf in the corner shouted loudly.

The forensic expert carefully looked at the half-elf and nodded, saying, "No mistake, this is a bite wound inflicted by a mouse's teeth."

"What?" "Are you kidding me?"

"How is it possible?" The crowd murmured in disbelief.

Although the deceased did not appear to be a strong person, their physical condition was above average. It's unrealistic for a mouse to bite them to death.

The expert who had initially spoken out against the theory laughed loudly, almost causing the doors and windows to shake.

The half-elf is one of the seven playable races that players can choose from.

They are numerous, ranking below humans, elves, and dwarves, but above half-elves, half-elves, and halflings.
Here is the translation of the text:

The half-human, half-beast is essentially the offspring of a human and a beast, and is accepted by both the beast tribe and human society. However, this half-human, half-beast is dressed in a suit of armor and wields a massive axe, clearly identifying himself as a "savage". This identity also prevents the drunken men in the tavern from daring to offend him. Otherwise, with his grayish skin, sloping forehead, prominent jaw, and coarse body hair, he would be shunned by civilized society. The attention of the tavern patrons is now focused on this half-human, half-beast savage, waiting for his response.

"What's going on?" someone asks.

"I don't know, I think it's an outsider," someone replies.

"It's probably a player. A half-human, half-beast savage, not someone who can analyze things rationally."

After all, the nickname for the "berserker" profession is "warrior" or "fighter", not "mage" or "intellectual".

At this point, the barbarian player realizes that everyone is fascinated by him and gazes at the corpse on the ground, which is gradually becoming icy cold. "The beast-man can achieve this," he says.

"Beast-man?" someone asks.

At this moment, everyone in the corridor feels a chilling sense of dread.

The oldest legend about the beast-man is that of the "werewolf".

The beast-man is a humanoid or giant humanoid biological being that can transform into an animal. It is not limited to humans.

"It's a beast-man," Serus says, feeling a sense of awe.

They all jumped to conclusions.
Without examining the wound closely, they were all led to the nearby vampire.

However, he looks puzzled, "Is the beast-man powerful?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu shook his head, "In animal form, humanoid beasts are like even more formidable animals, and that's it."

"What are some examples?" Serus, who had never encountered humanoid beasts before, was curious about the existence of these creatures.

"There are bears, tigers, wolves, and wild boars, including the rat-like humanoids that were just mentioned," Zhao Xu explained.

"It sounds like a bunch of trash," Serus said, taking a puff of smoke from his two nostrils. "What are they afraid of? Won't they attack the city?"

"From a theoretical perspective, that's how it is," Zhao Xu corrected. "However, the key point is that after being attacked by a humanoid beast, it's possible to contract the 'beastification syndrome' and then become a humanoid beast yourself, with the ability to spread it."

"In that case, your descendants will also be humanoid beasts, born that way," Zhao Xu said. "This is a perpetual curse."

"Ah, I see," Serus said, feeling moved.

So, looking at the imperfect vampires, it's actually not that bad. But if it were a humanoid beast, especially a grotesque rat-like one, it would definitely be shunned and avoided, feared for the risk of infection.

Just then, the deceased person's relatives slowly woke up and looked at the already stiff and cold body of their husband. The woman burst into tears. "You're dead, what are we going to do?"

"You promised me that, and our child has just been born... what am I supposed to do?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, the widow's anguished cry pierced the air, causing the female players in attendance to tear up and reach for their wallets.

"Sir Wilder, can you find the killer and avenge the deceased?" a sudden inquiry rang out from the audience.

However, the Wilder on stage couldn't help but reveal a look of embarrassment. In reality, he was only pretending to be knowledgeable and seeking to gain the audience's favor by pretending to be able to solve the problem.

"Idiot," a member of the same team, the female Druid player Red Maple Leaf, muttered under her breath.

In her opinion, it was pointless to analyze someone else's conclusions. She glanced around the audience, thinking about a plan to solve the problem.

"I want to avenge this poor widow," Vivian's voice became cold and filled with murderous intent.

The "Holy Avenger" in her hand suddenly flashed again, illuminating the hall.

"Not impossible," the Wilder on stage suddenly shouted, "Beastmen have a damage reduction ability, and can only be defeated by silver weapons. Are you willing to accept this proposal? Let's all cut ourselves with small knives and see who heals first."

"This is a ridiculous suggestion!" the White Dragon was about to curse loudly.

These strong biological beings didn't have a damage reduction ability.

Zhou Xu listened to this absurd proposal and couldn't help but shake his head, laughing.

Sirus and Vivian both had damage reduction abilities.
Here's the translation:

"He may not have anything, but the key is that even if he gives up defense, the other party is unlikely to penetrate his "Force Armor" which is a 12-layer defense consisting of a magical robe and shield magic. Even if it's broken through, it would depend on whether it's a magical weapon or not. If not, the damage wouldn't even qualify to go through his Stellar Cloak.

As Zhao Xu walked silently onto the stage, everyone's gaze suddenly fell on him.

"What's with this guy?"
"I don't know, but he's probably a mage since he's wearing a robe."
"Probably a player too, but can a player's three-legged cat magic really hold up?"
