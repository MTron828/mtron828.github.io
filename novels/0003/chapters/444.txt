Chapter 445: Inheritor and Secrets Holder

"Wow, teacher, would it be great if I used my power to cast spells?" 

At this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at his own 8 points of power, which had been added to 28 points of unknown value, making a total of 36 points of power. 

His intelligence had just barely managed to increase from 16 points to 28 points. 

In an instant, he had transformed from a weak and bookish scholar to a powerful warrior, unparalleled in the entire Northern Alliance. 

At this moment, Zhao Xu could feel his muscles expanding beneath his skin, filled with boundless energy, as if he could snap steel and pierce copper at any moment.

"Don't worry about it, use another spell," Anzhi Noya instructed. "As long as the next expedition goes smoothly, I'll give you this cover and the Arsenic Cross." 

Zhao Xu directly waved his "Magical Girl Rod" in front of Vi Vi's suppressed smile, and suddenly a powerful sacred energy burst forth, soaking Zhao Xu's entire body.

Finally, it was here.

The basic three-piece set of the former priest.

One Ring of Divine Favor, Four Rings of Divine Power, and Six Rings of Virtuous Qi, all of which had been put on by Zhao Xu. 

After putting on the three-piece set, even a priest who had just become a warrior would be stronger than a warrior. 

The impression of watching warriors wielding hammer-headed hammers and killing demons with a single blow had left a deep impression on Zhao Xu, which was also the reason he had been reborn with the determination to become a noble spellcaster. 

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have cast the "Divine Power" spell, increasing your attack power to level 7, gaining 1 HP (27 HP) as a spellcaster, and increasing your strength by 6 points, lasting for 24 hours】
Here is the translation of the text:

The power of the divine, strong as it is, allows it to increase the attack power of the priest to the same level as the warrior, instantly equivalent to a 7th-level warrior.

Generally speaking, a 7th-level mage can only reach 3 levels of attack power, but Zhao Xiu can reach 5 levels due to his dual elite status, which is also the peak he reached in his past life.

To further enhance his abilities, he will need to upgrade before "refining his combat skills".

However, with the aid of this divine magic, Zhao Xiu doesn't need to worry about his attack power; he can directly become a 7th-level warrior.

This is a four-ring magic that can instantly crush the accumulated skills of a warrior over many years.

The warrior can still be proud of his abilities, which can only be upgraded once every two levels.

"Ah, how much is your life value?" Anisy asked.

Zhao Xiu glanced at him, although he had lost 2 physical attributes due to the "Death Covenant", resulting in only 35 HP at level 7. However, he still possessed 63 HP from the "Doomed Domain" and 27 HP from the divine power.

"125 HP," Zhao Xiu replied.

Anisy nodded slightly, his expression somewhat satisfied, "Not bad, a warrior at around level 10 can also have this amount of life value. You also qualify for the title of invulnerable to one-hit death."

"Teacher, please tell me what's next," Zhao Xiu said, feeling a bit dizzy.

It was astonishing that he had over 100 life value, enough to surpass the life value of three players, and yet he was still only considered invulnerable to one-hit death.

"Let's go, let's get down," Anisy said, and the three of them went down together, walking all the way to the hillside, where they gazed silently at the lake in front of them.

At the other end of the lake, miners were working tirelessly, digging and hauling away ore.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two of them were like two worlds apart.

"Down below is a sacred temple," Anzilina said.

Then she gazed at Zhao Xu with a subtle gaze. "Do you know what kind of temple it is?"

Zhao Xu replied with a puzzled expression, "The ancient gods of the elements?"

It was during the time when the legendary mage, Ferguson, gave Zhao Xu the cursed staff of the dead and a notebook about the secrets of the underground.

The notebook contained the secrets that Ferguson had roughly explored over the years.

Originally, he had planned to use this as a last resort and a bargaining chip with the "Grazit" evil lord.

However, he couldn't be sure if it would work, so he had been delaying the disclosure of the secrets of the underground temple until now.

"Yes, it seems that Ferguson didn't waste his time digging up secrets of the underground," Zhao Xu evaluated the other mage, showing some curiosity.

"Teacher, do you know him?"

"This is certain. I've lived in Mistral for many years, and I have some impression of the mages who have reached the ninth circle. You think I'm calling him the 'Transmitter' for nothing?"

"What?" Zhao Xu felt that the title given to the other mage was more impressive than his own.

"To select a 'legendary mage' of this era is my duty, and it's also his legacy. Of course, if you have the natural talent and can break through, it's another story."

Transmitter!

Zhao Xu suddenly remembered the title he had heard in Mistral.

"That teacher, what about me, the transmitter? What's my position?"

Suddenly, Anzilina glanced at Zhao Xu. "Do you really want to know?"

"Yes?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu's inner expectations were limitless. "The spark of magical civilization." "If Arthur really does perish, we will break through the crystal barrier, and you will take Arthur's magical civilization with you, wandering alone in other multiverse dimensions, and then re-establish magical civilization." Anzhi said with a hint of tranquility.

Zhao Xu's face turned pale or dark, standing on the slope with a lake in the background, his mind more complex than the waves created by the flying birds.

"Teacher, our roles aren't supposed to be reversed, are they?" Zhao Xu lamented.

Standing behind them, Vivianne's mouth was slightly open. Even though she had served under the evil mother, Yon and Ernest, she couldn't imagine a day like this - Arthur's destruction.

"If Arthur has countless lives, but can only survive one, I will choose you, Zhong Xia, don't forget us."

Zhao Xu's head suddenly jerked up.

May had once recited the incantation on Earth, and the next sentence was the same: Zhong Xia, don't forget us. Here, the "us" refers to where, exactly?

"Let's go," Anzhi quickly regained her composure. She turned her back on the two of them and continued walking forward.

"It's said to be the Elemental Temple, but in reality, it's the burial site of the ancient elemental spirit, Mursel, who was buried here. Legend has it that his reformed form became the entire inner fire element plane after his death. I only found out about it in recent years, and it's true that it was buried here."

"The temple is a bit special, and it's impossible to teleport in. Inside, there's something I want to take, so we'll have to take our own steps to reach the destination."
Here is the translation:

"During the summer solstice, remember that the inner law is not very stable, so don't go wandering around recklessly." Anniya warned, "If you're not careful, you might connect Arthur and the elemental plane of fire."

"Messiah?"

"Not that bad, just the end of the world," Anniya replied.

This response sent a chill down Zhao Xu's spine, as if he had seen the top of the Starfall Town's mountain range covered in molten lava, with the players he had intended to gather suddenly dying off overnight.

Zhao Xu shook his head to dispel the image. "Should I still prioritize my melee skills, then?"

Anniya raised an eyebrow slightly. "You have the ability to do so."

"Of course," Zhao Xu said, glancing at his character card. He was currently holding a wand that could amplify his strength by +2, and his attack power had reached 23 levels, making him a legendary fighter.

Among his 7 profession levels, 2 enchantments, 16 strength levels, and -2 administrative levels.

At that moment, Anniya cast the water-breathing spell on him, and the three of them slowly entered the lake, letting the water slowly engulf them.

"Hey, teacher, you said you wanted to take something from below, but what exactly do you mean by that?"

The icy lake water had already reached Zhao Xu's neck, about to cover his entire body, when he suddenly popped out of the waves and asked Anniya.

"Go back and get the truth from back then."

...

The Holy Truth Hall.

At that moment, the highest evaluation meeting of the Mage Association was held, with seven giants gathered at the ends of the elliptical table.

Meanwhile, a young woman player wearing a formal mage robe stood straight and tall at the other end of the table, seemingly unflappable.

Despite being in a hall that no mage of the highest level had ever dared to enter, she showed no signs of nervousness.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Madam Wei, you have just reached level 5, and we plan to entrust you with the position of deputy head of the Starfall Town Mage Association. How do you feel about it?" said the chairman, sitting at the other end of the table.

He put down the pipe in his hand, no longer puffing on it, and didn't seem to care that the precious magical material had been used to make the pipe. The pipe was so fragile that it could recover its magical properties just by being sucked on.

"May I ask about the other chairman?" Wang Wei asked lightly, raising her hand to gesture a question.

She remembered that the deputy chairman position was supposed to be held by Xiu, who was a 7th-level mage.

"You should know, Xiu is a 7th-level mage," suddenly said the deputy chairman, who was sitting to the left of the chairman, with a hint of anger. "We need your help, and it's possible that you won't be able to rise to the top again, but only become his shadow."

"That's fine with me," Wang Wei said, her voice clear and bright, with a radiant light in her eyes.
