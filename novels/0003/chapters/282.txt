Chapter 283: The Three Major God Marks

At this moment, Zhao Xu was staring at the unusual mark on his arm, also known as a "God Mark".
The first God Mark, "Master of the Dead", resembled a wristband wrapped around his wrist, with only the central skull-shaped pattern revealing the characteristic of an "undying being".
The entire pattern was pure black, as if it had been meticulously painted and then ironed on.
However, Zhao Xu gently stroked the painted patterns without any sense of swelling or bulge, as if they had directly penetrated into his skin.
He also felt a strong vibration beneath the God Mark, like a cannon about to explode, constantly emitting energy that dispersed like smoke.

"Can you believe it's the Master of the Dead?" Lark said in awe.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Not a thing, my lord," Lark said, looking at Zhao Xu's arm God Mark with a hint of joy. "I just sensed my future evolutionary direction from the scattered energy."

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked, probing.

"Just a thought," Lark said.

"That's a power only gods can possess," Zhao Xu said, impressed.

"Superhuman power, something I never dared imagine," Zhao Xu said.

"The gods' specialty, indeed far surpasses that of mortals," Zhao Xu couldn't help but exclaim.

"You're not wrong to compare it to the gods' specialty," Lark said.
Here is the translation:

Master, the "Soul Sovereign" ability originally required a god level of 14 to possess. This godly being could command and destroy any undead creature at will. The only limitation was that it could not exceed the number of god levels per round.

This is a testament to the power of the ability and the undead creatures' helplessness.

Aside from the number limit, every other aspect shows that the undead creatures are completely unable to resist this "ability".

Unlike spells, which would require various restrictions, such as HD limits, spell resistance, and saving throws, as well as massive spellcasting materials, layer upon layer of limitations.

As for Zhao Xu, who possesses this divine mark, even facing legendary undead creatures, the opponent would still kneel down before this ability.

"Master, how about your remaining abilities?" Lark asked, expecting something.

"I'm a weakened version, only able to use it once, and can only destroy or control one undead creature," Zhao Xu explained.

At this moment, both of them fell silent.

The originally faint hope of obtaining the divine fragment was suddenly rekindled.

However, Zhao Xu and Lark both knew that they had to select the most suitable person.

But their gaze did not only fall on the "Half-God Mummy" or "Soul Devourer" appearing in the air.

Who knew what powerful existence was hidden beneath the City of the Dead?

"I'm wondering if I can use this ability on the 'Soul Devourer' or 'Half-God Mummy'," Zhao Xu hesitated.

"It's hard to say, it depends on how much divine essence the opponent retains," Lark said uncertainly.

Zhao Xu frowned slightly, only just feeling the limitless nature of this ability, but suddenly there was a loophole?
Here is the translation:

"Hey, don't underestimate this ability, even if the opponent has some divine power. As long as it's not truly divine, you can still control it, but only for a limited time. As for creatures like the 'Lava Demon' and the 'Winter Ghost', they are completely under control."

Laksis, as the embodiment of divine power, hurriedly explained to Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu's gaze also shifted to the "Sleeping Land" on the cliffside.

At present, releasing the "Devil's Seal" would be the most practical option.

However, this would result in the caster losing their magical abilities, provided it can be successfully released.

The series of "Quick Burst" spells were designed to create a delay, allowing the caster to react later.

Luckily, Zhao Xu could still sense the power of the "Soul Mark" without using this ability, and he could activate it freely, just like the "Feather Drop" technique.

So, even if the opponent had many tricks up their sleeve, Zhao Xu still had confidence.

At this point, Zhao Xu also explained his second divine mark, the "Soul Attribute" to Laksis.

His second divine mark was still in a state of preparation, and would only be activated after use, estimated to last for four to five days.

Some gods, like the former god of death, Nala, although not immortal, still possessed the characteristics of immortality.

Because they possessed the "Supernatural Power".

As long as Zhao Xu added the power of the "Soul Attribute" to it, he could gain the true "Immortal Shield" effect, not only preventing himself from being exposed, but also ensuring that his spells would not be affected by attacks on immortal beings.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xū was looking at the empty panel of his status, comparing the characteristics of the undead creatures listed on the god's mark information. He still felt a sense of unease.

As long as he activated this god's mark, he would be immune to the effects of the next five days. He would be directly immune to the impact on his mind, just like the "Enchantment", "Intimidation", "Illusion", "Mind Illusion", "Morale Effect", and other elements in the spell. He would essentially have the effect of a half- ring "Mind Barrier" spell.

At the same time, he would also be immune to the effects of poison, sleep, numbness, stun, disease, and death. He would not be affected by crushing blows, non-lethal injuries, attribute absorption, and energy absorption.

The undead creatures, such as the half-god mummy he saw at the beginning, would be directly affected by the "Despair" effect, which had a difficulty of 48 levels of difficulty that could not be touched, and would be trapped in a 3-round numbness.

After being immune to these abilities, Zhao Xū no longer had any worries.

At least the undead creatures could only kill him directly, and would not use various attribute-absorbing or numbing methods to kill him.

When dealing with undead creatures, the undead creatures themselves were still the most effective.

"Master, this undead trait, if it can be brought to the outside world, it would be really unbeatable," Laqís said.

However, Zhao Xū was still very clear, "The 'Wraith Mask' of the 8th Ring can also achieve similar effects. However, accepting the continuous process of the spell, the positive energy will become harm."

"That master, what about your third god's mark?" At this moment, Laqís also looked at the "god's mark" on the back of Zhao Xū's hand, which was a picture of an open book, but the seams of the book were filled with a cluster of chaotic clouds, and the clouds ultimately formed a giant open eye staring straight ahead.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The third divine mark is called 'Perception of Death.'" Zhao Xu spoke with a hint of puzzlement on his face.

"'This is indeed an ability,'" Larkix muttered to herself, "This is the divine power of the Death God, which only the Death God can possess. It allows the Death God to see the moment of a mortal's death and accurately know the time and method of their death."

Zhao Xu gazed at his own divine marks, his eyes lingering on the third mark, "Commander of the Undead". Among the three marks, this one was the most weakened, and the entire mark's power was the most unstable. The energy inside was turbulent, and there was a high chance of it collapsing at any moment.

The second and third marks, "Undead Traits" and "Perception of Death", seemed more like a constant state spell, continuously outputting a small amount of power, enveloping Zhao Xu's entire body.

"Master, which of the three divine marks do you think has the greatest effect on you?" Larkix suddenly asked Zhao Xu.

"'Perception of Death', of course," Zhao Xu responded immediately.

"What? It's not just able to let you directly command a legendary creature's 'Undead Lord', nor is it able to let you transform into an 'Undead Feature' that cannot be recognized?"

Zhao Xu shook his head. "Larkix, this kind of fishing question is not good. As a mortal, I can only use this mark to sense my own death after it's activated. The remaining energy can be used about five times to 'perceive' my own death."

"This way, I can continuously make judgments about when I will die, and avoid those paths leading to death."

As Zhao Xu spoke, his mind was already analyzing and planning his next move.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

From the moment he obtained these three divine patterns, he undoubtedly increased his chances of becoming a "God of Death" by 30 to 50%.

He is currently in a combat state characterized by weak attack, strong defense, and high information.

Even his two major divine patterns have indirectly influenced his judgment logic for "perceiving death".

Originally, Zhao Xu might have been detected by a highly intelligent undead being and could have triggered a relentless battle.

At that time, he would have perceived his own death as being surrounded by low-level undead creatures.

Now, even if he encounters a single legendary "Half-God Mummy", he will not perceive his own death.

When he encounters two of them, he can control one of them to fight another undead creature and will be trapped in a stalemate.

Only in the case of three or more high-level undead creatures, or after he has used up his first divine pattern, will "perceiving death" take effect and allow him to perceive his own death.

After this reasoning, Zhao Xu has come to understand that he is the strongest when he is not using the "Spirit of the Dead".

Even the same "God of Decay" who has the same divine nature as Zhao Xu might directly sense Zhao Xu's divine power and deliberately avoid him.

Knowing he can't win, Zhao Xu still insists on going up to fight. This is the behavior of an intelligence of 8-point being.

"The only question now is, why is there this statue and why was I given these three divine patterns?"

Several possibilities flashed through Zhao Xu's mind.
