Chapter 448: Farewell Immortality

During the flight process where Zhao Xu had traversed over a thousand levels of vast stairs, he didn't expect to hear such explosive news from Ana Noel's mouth.

This was also the second time he had heard about the "Annihilation" of the world.

However, he quickly reacted, saying, "Teacher, if that's the case, then it's likely that the Fire Elemental Lord 'Moses Zelin' is acquainted with Ernest, so should we rashly enter their tomb?"

Arthur's rule was that there was no tomb for the dead, and even if it had been excavated after a certain period of time, there was no place to reason to go, and one would have to bear the consequences oneself.

However, excavating a familiar person, especially Ana Noel, who said not to mention that Moses Zelin knew Ernest, which would likely be unwise.

"How could it be?" Ana Noel smiled awkwardly.

"Ergo, Ernest's personal charm lies in the fact that his enemies will not suspect him of having a guess about this world."

"Although Ernest himself is not a serious and honest person, he never deigns to use lies to gain any advantage."

"So this Fire Elemental Origin, Moses Zelin, heard Ernest's words and thought that the world would be annihilated in a few years, and thus chose to commit suicide, which is also his own fault."

At this point, Ana Noel's eyes glanced at Zhao Xu, saying, "Or maybe you think I know where this place is. Although I am confident in my abilities, this is ultimately a remnant of the ancient times, the earliest batch of gods."

"Is it our lord who brought us in?" Vivian asked, her forehead already furrowed as if she was about to get a headache.

Regardless of other professions, the Saint Warrior would never stoop to grave-robbing.

At this moment, Anniya seemed to be lost in thought.

"It's not wrong," she said. "The last time was when he brought me here, and then I was dragged away by the graveyard."

This explanation left Zhao Xu even more bewildered. Anniya had come here to investigate something.

And what about Ernest?

"Teacher, this graveyard probably wouldn't be able to attract a king of magic," Ernest said.

Initially, Ernest had seized the entire magical empire's resources and built a treasure trove.

As for Moszelin, he would never leave behind any magical artifacts in his graveyard. This place looked completely desolate and barren, and even robbers would be repelled by it.

"How can that be?" Anniya laughed. "The revival qualifications of a divine being are still quite tempting."

Just then, Vivia suddenly looked like her wings had broken off, and her entire figure lost its balance.

She quickly regained her composure and caught up with the rest of the group.

Zhao Xu was stunned, unable to say a word.

Anniya's simple words had revealed countless secrets.

Moszelin, this ancient divine being, had initially misunderstood Ernest's message and took his own life to avoid danger. However, after his death, Ernest still managed to plunder his revival qualifications.

It was definitely a thieving act.

"So, do you think that's why most divine beings of the same era hate Ernest?" Anniya said.

Zhao Xu immediately noticed that the other person was deliberately leaving something unsaid.

"So, Teacher, you and Ernest entered the graveyard with others?"

It was undoubtedly the true target of the chosen revival.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In midsummer, you're really sensitive to this aspect, it seems I didn't bring the wrong person in."

Anniya sighed and said, "He also brought a demon in back then."

"It's the same demon who betrayed his original camp, 'Holy Warrior of Demons' Elrioth."

"Or maybe you all will betray your original camp's demons later, and you'll have to thank this original Holy Warrior of Demons for opening up this path."

At this moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but glance at Elrioth, and Elrioth seemed to be taken aback, as if she had also had a mentor like him millions of years ago.

"What's the relationship?" Zhao Xu asked vaguely.

"What are you thinking? Although Ernest is unrestrained, he is still pure and uncorrupted, and he hasn't fallen for any temptation."

"That Holy Warrior of Demons was saved by an angel from Heaven Mountain after being rescued by the opponent and then fell in love with that angel. However, she was clear that she had to get divine power to resist the innate evil and corruption within herself."

"So she sacrificed her ideals and virtues to become a Holy Warrior and prayed to benevolent gods for help. However, her fate was not smooth sailing, and the angel she loved died in an unexpected accident. At that time, they came in to think of a way to revive the angel. They wanted to see if they could revive the angel's body, which had left a revival loophole in the Mosze forest."

At this moment, Elrioth heard the story of a mentor similar to him and couldn't help but ask, "What happened later?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Nature has failed us, and the spirit of this tomb has used the method of burning jade and stone to directly undo our efforts."

At this moment, Anzhiya said, but the three of them had already reached the end of this thousand-meter-long staircase.

At the top of the stairs, there were seven iron chains suspended from above, each attached to a colorful "lantern" corresponding to the seven colors of the rainbow.

The light was dim, making it difficult to see the surroundings, except for the embedded glass fragments on the dome that sparkled with a faint glow.

Zhao Xu also noticed that outside the dome, there was a profound darkness that was difficult to penetrate, with no other path like a floating island in the sky.

"Choose any lantern to gaze at, and you will be able to enter the main chamber of the tomb," Anzhiya said.

"Look?"

"No mistake," Anzhiya's tone was calm. "Gazing will bring you into a dream state, usually targeting the innermost temptations of the heart. As long as you hold fast to your heart, you can easily overcome the obstacles."

Zhao Xu nodded and looked straight up at the brightest red lantern.

Slowly, the lantern became more comfortable in his eyes, and his line of sight began to blur, with light and shadow separating into two.

...

It was as if everything from the past to the present had never existed.

There was no warmth, no vibration, and the stillness was the eternal theme.

Zhao Xu realized he was in a pitch-black space with no sound at all, everything was eerily quiet.

He was standing on a shallow puddle of water.

"Light technique."

He tried to illuminate, but the darkness suddenly swallowed the light.

"Luminous technique."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu upgraded again, and in an instant, a magical power burst forth, illuminating everything within a radius of several dozen meters like daylight. However, it was immediately suppressed and rendered ineffective.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to unleash an even more intense attack, a brilliant light suddenly fell from the sky, as if spreading hope. He suddenly saw a man sitting silently in front of him, with his back turned towards him.

The man was tall and lean, with a strong and unyielding aura. "I've been waiting for you for a long time," said the old voice.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xu asked.

"You may have heard of me, or you may not have," replied the man, who seemed exhausted and lacked the energy to even glance at Zhao Xu.

"What are you?" Zhao Xu continued to press for an answer.

"I am Mosze Lin, a fool who has avoided the impending disaster and chosen to die," the man said, his voice like a sigh.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat, and his inner thoughts were filled with turmoil.

The man before him was none other than Mosze Lin, the first ancient god who ruled over the fire element in the ancient times, as described by Ana Noiya. Moreover, according to Ana Noiya, he should have been a test of temptation, but how could he appear before him as a dead but not dead existence?

"Why are you here, eternal one?" Zhao Xu asked hesitantly.

The man's voice continued, "The dead do not talk about immortality. I am here to ask you for a promise."
