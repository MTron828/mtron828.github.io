Chapter 588: The Choice of Divine Arts Path

After Zhao Xu returned to the Arthurian world from An Ti Nuo Ya's memories and recounted this chapter of his past, both An Ti Nuo Ya and the newly appeared May were plunged into deep thought.

Especially when he recounted the dialogue with that "Ernest" at the time, Zhao Xu did not omit a single word.

In contrast, he was unexpectedly promoted to level 10 by the opponent's gift. However, this was not a remarkable achievement.

Subconsciously, Zhao Xu felt that he had somehow touched on a possible key secret that could affect the fate of Arthur.

The connections within might actually involve the life and death of Arthur as a whole.

From a combat strength perspective, Ernest's arrival in Arthur's world, relying on the rumored eleven-ring magic, might be at the pinnacle of this world.

This can be seen from the fact that he effortlessly broke through all obstacles and created the only magic empire that has ever ruled all of Arthur's territories.

However, Ernest, who is still in that "fearsome" world, said that without the protection of the eleven-ring magic, even gods might easily die.

This made Zhao Xu re-experience a new world.

He felt like he was driving a sailboat and discovered that the shore he thought he had reached was actually a strait, and what lay ahead was the vast ocean that had already begun to stir up waves.

After An Ti Nuo Ya and May listened quietly to Zhao Xu's words, they did not say much before hastily leaving.

As for Zhao Xu, he was wringing his hands in frustration over his level 10.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He is troubled about how to choose and what to choose. It's unquestionable that when he reaches level 10, he won't undergo a significant change like he did when he reached level 9. However, it's still a matter of concern for his future path.

At level 10, he can decide to continue advancing in the arcane profession. At that time, he will be a 5th-level mage, 3rd-level super-magician, and 2nd-level mage guard.

Although the 2nd-level ability of the mage guard is just a single "super-magical specialty" that can bring him a significant boost. He will have additional super-magical abilities, which will allow him to increase his combat power.

However, what really bothers him is the choice of advancing on the divine path.

In the week he's lost, the entire wasteland has been rapidly developing. Except for one aspect, where food is being transported in and consumed at an alarming rate, countless human beings are also racing against time to cultivate this land.

Everyone knows that the gods' transportation of food is unsustainable. When they have harvested enough faith, they will not be able to keep up with the "consumption of food". At that time, the gods may choose to take away the devout followers and let the remaining people fend for themselves.

No one knows if they themselves are devout followers, so everyone is racing against time.

After humans acquired the ability to cultivate the land, their evolutionary path has been advancing towards this angle for thousands of years. Therefore, they do not need to carry heavy loads like other species, so they have not developed in the direction of high altitude.

(Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese characters, as per the request.)
Here is the translation of the text:

After arriving in this barren wasteland, people who are used to being pampered and indulged, unless they have a natural talent for their profession or are under the protection of a powerful player, will quietly pick up their tools and head to the wasteland to start farming.

Each person is struggling to survive and make a living, and there is no idle person in the entire wasteland.

On the other hand, a few players and powerful factions that have entered the wasteland are slowly starting to settle down and recruit professional students to expand their influence.

For example, Zhao Xu has started recruiting "apprentices" for his "Mages' Guild".

In secret, he has also started training the talented mages brought by Anni's "Seed Plan".

Meanwhile, "Character Cards" have become the hottest topic among humans on Earth.

Everyone is discussing and debating the significance of each project on the Character Card, and which profession is stronger.

The concept of professionals, adventurers, and other related terms has become more deeply ingrained in people's minds.

Countless young children have set their sights on becoming a professional and obtaining a Character Card system to see their own character attributes.

For example, Zhao Xu's parents only found out about his plan to assign 32 attribute points to his parents when he first brought them into the "Create Character" interface.

At this moment, humans on Earth are starting to realize that they have inherited the physical characteristics of their ancestors who lived on Earth, which is what they were like on Earth, just like King Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Generally speaking, if we average out the entire human population, all attributes will be very uniform, with each attribute being around 2 points. Therefore, the average starting points for humans would be 12 points.

However, all spellcasting professions require a minimum of 11 points in the key attribute for spellcasting.

By the time you reach the second circle of magic, you'll need 12 points.

As a result, even though humans know that wizards and priests are the elite, they are still held back by their low scores in "intelligence", "perception", and "charm" attributes.

For example, a wizard who scores above 13 in intelligence will find it difficult to become a wizard apprentice.

An ordinary person with 11 intelligence will not be able to learn magic and will not be qualified to learn magic.

However, there are some people who have exceptional abilities, such as those with 32, 28, or 24 points, and they quickly rise to the top with their advantages.

But no one dares to have a "big-picture" view and imagine how their character sheet will develop in the future and what kind of combat power they will need to increase.

Zhao Xu, for example, understands that in terms of static numbers, he relies on the potential point system and the combination of super-magic control and spell endurance. As a result, he has basically accumulated enough combat power.

The only thing lacking is his dynamic ability. For example, in the action system, he also has "swift strike" and other similar abilities.

So his focus is directly on the "Red Jade" profession, which allows him to convert 1 point of energy into an additional swift spellcasting ability after reaching 7th level in the "Divine Energy Surge" ability.

Generally, when casting spells, you can only cast one quick spell and then one standard spell before running out of energy.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu, who can unleash his inner power, can cast several swift spells at once, dealing massive damage of up to 10,000 points. After that, he can use his ability to dispel the buffs of his profession and restore his stamina using his latent points.

This is the true meaning of infinite flight, either defeating him instantly or waiting for his infinite actions. However, Red Jade Guardian's level 1 and 6 cannot be upgraded, and even if Zhao Xu can upgrade his level to 7, he will still be lacking two levels of spellcasting.

At that time, his arcane path will be 16 levels, allowing him to cast eight-circle spells.

However, due to the loss of the 1st-level Monk, Red Jade Guardian's 2nd-level spellcasting is only 3 levels, resulting in only seven-circle spellcasting at level 16.

Moreover, Red Jade Guardian needs to master the "pious flow" martial arts and stance, unless he focuses on mastering these skills, it is better to advance to the three-great-nine-sword foundation profession.

The most suitable one is the Crusader (Ten Thousand Swords), which requires the mastery of pious flow martial arts and stance, and can be satisfied at level 1, also improving Zhao Xu's melee combat ability.

However, the Crusader does not upgrade spellcasting.

Therefore, when he reaches level 17, he will be 1 Monk/4 Scholar of the Ancient Tome/4 Cursed Text Guardian/1 Crusader/7 Red Jade Guardian, and his arcane path will be able to cast nine-circle spells, but his spellcasting level will only be 13, allowing him to cast seven-circle spells.

However, these issues will not be a problem after he reaches level 20.

Because at level 21, he will not be able to cast legendary spells, and his abilities will be determined by his mysterious knowledge and religious knowledge levels.
Here is the translation:

As the 21st-level divine art exceeds the 17th-level divine art by a few extra nine-ring slots, it's meaningless to Zhao Xu, who has potential points. In other words, he will find it extremely challenging in the divine art aspect before reaching the nine-ring level, but fortunately, the astral line won't drop out, allowing him to make progress.

This is also the reason why many players who start playing the game will abandon their jobs and delete their accounts after a period of time. Compared to players of the same level, the gap of one or two rings is enormous.

Taking on a 1-level job is already a huge loss for a mage.

As Zhao Xu was assigned by the goddess to be a "Monsignor" job at the beginning, which, in essence, provides him with the "Magic Domain" to protect the sacred texts, "Plan Domain" to delay the casting of spells, and "Knowledge Domain" to exchange knowledge for devotion. Additionally, he has another astral line that won't drop out, making him look less miserable.

Therefore, Zhao Xu is worried about whether to give up his divine art abilities and choose the Crusader path at level 10.

In the end, his divine art table is far more exaggerated than his astral table.

Meanwhile, the critical "Resurrection" divine art, which is a key skill, is also waiting for him.

For people on the current earth, there is no spell more powerful and awe-inspiring than "Resurrection".

However, if Zhao Xu chooses to continue leveling up his divine art abilities, but delays the Crusader path, he hasn't thought about what he wants to progress to.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a 1st-level "Divine Oracle" can obtain the "Prophecy Domain" and exchange it for other powerful domains using the "Exchange Domain" spell, but this requires a 1st-level "Religious Knowledge" skill. For Zhao Xuyu, this is too wasteful. Without any prerequisites, those who have touched certain entities such as gods or divine servants can access this domain, but Zhao Xuyu, with only 12th-level "Religious Knowledge", cannot progress and must wait until he reaches 11th level to choose.

Otherwise, this 1st-level can upgrade to a free domain, which is one of the best options for leveling up divine abilities.

In general, people do not have this option for profession advancement.

However, if you want to make your "Character Card" stronger, you need to start using low-cost but high-intensity "Profession Upgrades" or "Part-time Basic Professions".

The result is essentially trading "Character Card" "Distortion" for "Strength".

Aside from the initial players who can upgrade at a low threshold, in the current Arthurian environment, it's almost impossible to see the shadow of profession advancement without loyal dedication to the organization.

Profession Upgrades are essentially the privileges given to organization members.

Zhao Xuyu is still entangled in more than just this point.

This time, he was influenced by Ernest's 11th-level "Ring Law" spell, and he lost the ability to resist and was trapped in the mud. He also looks forward to the "Iron Heart Force" ability that can terminate all "uncomfortable" states.

However, this "Iron Heart Force" martial art requires a premise of mastering another "Iron Heart Flow" martial art, which means he needs to master two specialties and can only use it temporarily. The limitations are significant.

Alternatively, he can directly take on the 1st-level "Warrior of the Military Way" (Military Sword) to master the Iron Heart Flow, which is the most straightforward but will delay his divine ability route.
Here is the translation:

"When Zhao Xu finally reaches level 22, he can finally master the nine-ring magic. However, he is now 5 levels behind the expected path. His wife is already an elder, sighing in despair as he gazes at his character card. He is frustrated that his dual elite professions are so complicated, and he wonders how other players are managing."
