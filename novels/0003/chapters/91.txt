Chapter 092: Turning Corner

Zhao Xu looked at everyone as they rushed out, and hastily shouted, "Each of you, maintain a distance of two meters, and make sure you have enough time."

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already reacted, but his hasty thinking was still a bit lacking.

If there were still unknown pitfalls ahead, setting up like that would require the combined weight of two people to start, and if they all charged forward together, they would be instantly crushed.

Rainbow had already tested it, and a single person could safely pass through.

In this underground city filled with unknowns, it was indeed necessary to repeat this tested experience.

But as Zhao Xu watched everyone hastily opening up distances, advancing in batches, he didn't worry too much about the time.

Starting from the current 10th round, as long as they reached the destination within 5 rounds, it wouldn't affect Zhao Xu and Luo Ya's plan to leave at the 15th round - when the cannon would be recharged for the third time.

And the two paths were only 70-80 meters long, taking 30 seconds to pass through, which was crawling distance.

"Magic is truly mysterious," Luo Ya exclaimed as everyone had already passed the turning corner.

He opened his hand, as if wanting to touch the air filled with mysterious magical particles.

Zhao Xu glanced at Luo Ya, surprised that the other was still quite clever, knowing that it wasn't the outermost protective barrier that protected them, but the entire spherical magical effect that protected them.

These were the true reasons why low-level magic spells were suppressed.

This was also why fireballs launched into the boundary would have no special effects within the sphere, but the aftershocks would still appear outside the boundary.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If warriors could master this technique, wouldn't it be possible to suppress low-level mages?" Ro Ya thought for a moment and asked casually.

At this point, only Zhao Xu and Ro Ya were left in the room.

"This technique only suppresses the magical effect, and it's just a magical effect," Zhao Xu thought for a moment and said.

Anzhi Noya had told him as soon as they arrived, not to believe too much in these ineffective immune-type spells.

Their greater significance is that they can help him waste a high-level mage's spellcasting action.

"Can you explain?" Ro Ya, who had always been curious about mysterious things and couldn't get his questions answered, was full of curiosity.

Perhaps only when facing a life-and-death crisis can many questions be asked boldly.

"The physical objects created by magic can be destroyed. Second, mages can dispel this spell," Zhao Xu gave a simple example.

For instance, a certain anime's god's right hand can render all effects nullified, but it cannot block being hit by a flying stone and injuring oneself, which is the reason.

"Okay, I'll create some distance, wait for my signal, and then you can run. You don't need to worry about me," Zhao Xu said as he gazed at the curse cannon.

The small team had already reached their destination and had shouted at the door, but this time the voice was much lighter.

Zhao Xu's secondary spell shield had already blocked the third spell, and the time had reached the thirteenth round.

He took three or four meters away from Ro Ya, partly to create some distance to avoid some hidden risks and partly to get to a safe distance.

Only when he got to a safe distance could he free up his hands to cast spells.

In this way, he could cast spells to protect Ro Ya in time, even if Ro Ya didn't run out in time.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The secondary spell barrier is an unmovable and fixed barrier that makes it difficult for Zhao Xu to move around. However, the barrier has a range of three meters and can reverse many things. At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyebrows rose slightly - the demonic statue finally shot out the fourth spell "Vampire's Touch".

This spell was originally designed to take effect only when in close proximity, but for the spell tower, it was enough to hit the target from a distance. Until the light of the "Vampire's Touch" spell fell on the barrier, Zhao Xu suddenly shouted, "Run!" and then turned around and ran away without looking back.

Unfortunately, the damage from the "Vampire's Touch" spell was not enough to withstand, and Zhao Xu was thinking of letting the opponent take the spell instead. From the 14th round's "Vampire's Touch" to the 16th round's fireball spell, Zhao Xu had only 12 seconds of spare time.

However, they needed to run a distance of at least 70 meters. Even if the spell tower released the spell quickly, they might not even have 12 seconds. The only truly safe time was the 6 seconds in the 15th round.

As they rushed forward, they were not running a short sprint, but rather a marathon. Although Zhao Xu's strength was only 8 points, his agility was 13 points, and his endurance was 14 points, which still allowed him to run at a decent speed.

When he reached the end and arrived at the base of the spell tower, he had only spent half the time, and even the 15th round had not yet passed. After hearing the footsteps behind him, Zhao Xu took a deep breath of the underground air, turned sharply to the right, and ran towards the light of the torch.

There, a small team was waiting for them. "Hurry, we're almost there."

Finally, Zhao Xu burst into the estimated safe distance of the team's cry. At the same time, Luo Ya, who had just dropped his dagger from his waist, did not dare to look back. Zhao Xu sprinted to a halt, panting heavily, with his hands on his waist. He felt the scorching sensation in his lungs.

It was only the 15th round, but Zhao Xu had already arrived at the destination earlier than expected. The "devil statue" had not cast another fireball spell by the 16th round.

"Finally, I'm safe," Zhao Xu said with a sigh, releasing his tight grip on the staff. "Mr. Zhong Xue, you're really too powerful. When can I be like you?" the priest asked with admiration.

The wanderer, Rainbow, and the poet, South Pole Frog, also looked at him with admiration.

Zhao Xu tightened his grip on the staff in his hand.

"You should have learned more magic at the Magic Goddess's temple when you were younger," Zhao Xu smiled and replied.

"Yeah, I know," the novice priest said with a pout.

"It's too dangerous ahead, let's regroup and set out again," Zhao Xu said.

"Yes," Luo Ya, the team leader, said, pulling out his weapon from its scabbard.

"I'll cast a spell first, and then I'll take point, just got too passive," Zhao Xu said, starting to gesture and chant a spell.

"Shield of the Law!"
"Protect from Evil!"
"Divine Domain!"

Zhao Xu's spells followed one another, as if they were all freebies.

"It seems I just gave away my secret," a hoarse voice echoed.
At first, the team of six people who arrived first stood opposite, their faces twisted into cunning smiles, gazing at Zhao Xu and Luo Ya, their mouths uttering the same sound.
