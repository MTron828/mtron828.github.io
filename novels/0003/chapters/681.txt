Chapter 682: Judgment of the Demonic War

As an adventurer about to enter the depths, Zhao Xiu had spare time to randomly search for knowledge about demons.

Even during the night when others were sleeping, he utilized the time to read demonology books due to his ability as a citizen.

The moment he heard the "Mysterious Call", he analyzed that it was a type of ability related to demon summoning!

Most demons possess summoning abilities similar to this.

Although it's not a direct "summoning", it's just a projection of the opponent, and there would be no loss of life.

However, demons rarely use this ability unless necessary.

In some cases, it's even more difficult to recognize than the "true trump card of demons".

Therefore, when he heard the use of this ability, it meant one thing: there was a demon present.

Moreover, the opponent directly used a desperate move!

Zhao Xiu was not a blind mage who sat and waited for death; he immediately used a four-ring spell that could turn demons to dust - Ideal Summoning Field.

This four-ring transformation spell, which was an element of good, could convert a 12-meter (expanding to 24 meters) radius around him into a region where only benevolent beings could be summoned.

From then on, the summoned creatures would only be the benevolent versions of the original beings.

For example, the summoned Hellhound would automatically transform into a Heavenly Beast, or other benevolent beings of the same level.

As soon as the benevolent aura emitted from his side, Zhao Xiu also saw an unusual sight ahead...
Here is the translation of the text:

The demon in front of us has a simian body and a pig-like head, with a bizarre combination of a humanoid figure and a demonic head. This strange creature can stand upright on two legs and has a small pair of wings on its back.

Even more terrifying, there are over ten of these demons, occupying the entire area.

"Judge of Souls, level 14, giant demon from another dimension," Zhao Xu briefly introduced.

These demons are able to use the "summon" supernatural power, indicating that they are real entities.

Unlike the six-armed demon that Zhao Xu met in the painting earlier.

The teeth of these demons have burst out of their mouths, looking razor-sharp. Their noses and chins have also broken out of their skin, resembling small fangs.

These demons, over six meters tall and weighing over seven or eight tons, are tasked with waiting for souls who have been condemned to destruction and exile in the bottomless abyss. They will subject them to a brutal judgment.

Of course, these demons are also enjoying the opportunity to punish criminals.

Meanwhile, the three of them - Xu, Zheng Xin, and Lü Yu - saw the fifteen demons, as massive as small mountains, and were stunned into a state of numbness.

These demons, towering over three floors high, had arms as thick as their entire bodies, making it impossible to muster any resistance.

At the same time, the ground beneath their feet was affected by the summoning power of the demons, as if it had turned into molten lava, constantly bubbling up black bubbles.

"Is it the power of demon summoning?" Zheng Xin exclaimed involuntarily.

Zhao Xu had already briefed her on the demon's racial abilities on the road, and the "summon" was an unforgettable chapter.
Here is the translation:

"The Judge of the Soul can use the ability to summon monsters twice a day, each time summoning - 

1-4 level 9 Flare Demons, 1-4 level 11 War Demons, or 1 level 13 Deception Demons, with a success rate of 50%. Additionally, it can also summon another "Judge of the Soul" with a success rate of 20%.

This effect is considered a five-ring summoning spell, but is actually a simultaneous summoning of multiple Judge of the Soul. Even if the efficiency is general, they will be killed by a batch of demons in a few seconds.

Just thinking about this scene is enough to make people shiver.

At the moment when Zhao Xu's face turned white, the bubbles began to coalesce and the summoning power slowly reshaped their bodies.

The War Demons resembled giant toads, with long arms instead of legs. Their massive jaws contained powerful teeth, and their backs were covered in sharp spines.

"War Demons are the soldiers of the demon army, responsible for supervising troop formation and commanding small units during battles," Zhao Xu explained. "Unlike powerful demons, they are not cunning, but will use tactics during battles."

As he spoke, more Flare Demons also took shape.

They resembled the combination of a strong human and an eagle, with extremely muscular limbs and feathers on their bodies. Their necks were adorned with eagle heads, with beaks shaped like bird claws. Some Flare Demons also gripped skulls in their claw-like hands.

Zhao Xu glanced around and added, "Flare Demons are terrifying warriors in the demon world, skilled at swooping down on enemies from the air. Although they have an advantage in mobility, they also enjoy engaging in close combat with enemies."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As for the fewest number of seductive demons, they are as tall as giants. Their bodies are completely typical of demonic appearances, with a broad torso and four arms connected to weapons, two claws, and two powerful pincers. The head is dog-like, with a long horn on top, a sharp jawline, and icy cold eyes full of cunning and wisdom.

"Seductive demons are skilled at luring humans into temptation, but their methods are more about power and wealth. As long as there is a gap in one's heart, they can easily be caught off guard."

However, Zhao Xu's introduction only made Allow and Lü Yu's hearts feel increasingly uneasy.

No matter how one looks at these monsters, they all possess extraordinary combat power, completely unmatched by the original human-eating demons in the lair.

Although they are all referred to as demons, the gap between them is as vast as the difference between a chicken and an eagle.

"Captain, shall we flee?" Allow asked, troubled, as more and more demons were summoned out, leaving the three of them with limited space to stand.

The underground cave was no larger than the battlefield they had just fought on, making it difficult for Zhao Xu to avoid damaging himself with his AOE spell.

However, Zhao Xu was calm and composed, "Don't worry, I just released the 'Ideal Summoning Field' spell."

"The effect of this spell can turn these monsters into my allies."

Unexpectedly, the summoned "demon allies" suddenly turned against the judges and charged towards the front, completely ignoring Zhao Xu and the two of them.

Killing demons was no difficult task for Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

It's difficult to deal with these devils in a dignified manner, and yet, they are still able to summon them with ease. This is also the source of their confidence when they watch plays with their pants down.

However, this summoning spell cannot automatically dispel itself and will continue to last until the spell's effect wears off.

The moment before, the originally rigid soul judgment formation was suddenly dispersed by the devils summoned by them. However, the soul judges standing in the back row immediately targeted Zhao Xuan's position and unleashed their own devilish powers --- Jealousy!

These extremely evil powers enveloped their bodies like a rainbow-colored halo, and began to continuously increase their evil aura levels. They then spread to a 20-meter radius area, just enough to cover Zhao Xuan and his two companions.

Zhao Xuan's mind was clear at this moment. He knew that these soul judges could unleash three Jealousy attacks every day.

Any living being trapped in this state would fail their willpower check and see the most terrifying fear illusion in their minds, eventually falling into a dazed state for 1-10 rounds. This process would render these living beings unable to act and make them easy prey.

Only "devils" like Zhao Xuan would not be affected, which is also the reason he deliberately used the "Ideal Summoning Field". Otherwise, summoning new monsters might not even reach the soul judges' presence.

Zhao Xuan couldn't help but glance at his two teammates.

With his willpower ability, these 22nd-level willpower checks wouldn't be able to overwhelm him, not even for his teammates, Yu'er and Lu Yu.

These high-level battles were like a walk in the park for Zhao Xuan, but for them, they were a fatal blow. Zhao Xuan just shook his head.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, he didn't seem to be able to exempt the two of them from the influence of this evil light by any means. However, he could use his "elastic ball" or "sheltering wings" to quickly pull them out of the 20-meter range and avoid this situation. But Zhao Xu didn't do anything, and even his hands that were about to cast a spell were held back.

As soon as the evil light hit, the ring of light seamlessly attached to Airen and Luyu, and these two women who were not even 1st-level adventurers were completely controlled, as if they were wrapped in tight silk threads. Their faces turned white, as if they had fallen into a deep dream state.

The fear of being unable to escape or hide directly caused their bodies to tremble with fear.

However, Zhao Xu's "group healing" spell still landed on the two of them a second later, and the minor wounds on their bodies were instantly healed.

What's more important is that Zhao Xu had been maintaining the "medical knowledge" spell from the beginning to remove the aftereffects of his own rapid explosion. All the healing spells he cast had the added effect of removing dizziness.

In an instant, Airen and Luyu both regained consciousness and woke up, but they were already covered in cold sweat, as if they had just woken up from a long nightmare. Zhao Xu was sympathetic, but he understood that this tuition was not optional.

All he could do was coldly gaze at the group of demon souls.

I will give them punishment, and kill them mercilessly.
