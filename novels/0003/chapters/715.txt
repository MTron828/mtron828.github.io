"Starting bid: 20 gold coins!"

In a bustling underground auction hall, an enthusiastic auctioneer shouted loudly, behind him was a iron cage containing a half-elf girl who was shaking with fear.

"Her elf father disappeared when she was born, and her human mother passed away last night. You won't have to worry about anything if you buy her!"

The guests below couldn't help but glance at the half-elf girl locked in the cage.

Sheti is the largest slave trading center in the entire northern region, with countless powers and slave traders gathering there every day. This underground auction is no exception.

As for the auction of a half-elf girl, she looks pitiful and helpless, but she's just a small dish for these people.

When the auctioneer started describing the uses of the girl, a gray-haired old man finally raised his hand. His dull eyes were fixed on the girl with anticipation, and the guests around him were laughing.

Unlike the enthusiastic bidders, there was a black-robed wizard who had remained silent and still, waiting for the auction of an ancient staff that had been passed down through history.

As for the slaves?
He could enslave anyone in the room with a mere spell, without putting in much effort.

Everything that happened during the auction process was of no interest to him.

But this time, it was as if he felt something in his heart. The black-robed wizard opened his eyes that had been closed for a long time.

Suddenly, he saw the girl who had been imprisoned in the cage for just a day, looking dirty and unkempt.
A young girl is deeply immersed in her grief over her mother's passing, completely unaware of the cruel fate that awaits her. Her gaze becomes fixed and dull, but suddenly, a strange feeling stirs within her, and she raises her eyes to meet those of a black-robed sorcerer.

This fleeting glance seems to transcend time and space, transporting them to a vast expanse of time. The sorcerer's eyes widen as he gazes at the girl's pitiful smile, reminiscent of a sunflower standing tall amidst a torrential downpour. His heart skips a beat.

Could this girl possibly be connected to the memories I've lost? The sorcerer's hand instinctively rises, but just as he's about to bid, the master of ceremonies above him bangs the gavel.

"Congratulations to the winner of the auction, the black-robed sorcerer! However, it seems you're a bit too slow. Who gave you the right to hold up the proceedings?"

The sorcerer stands up, his eyes flashing with determination, and shakes his head. "I'm sorry, but I need to take her away."

This sudden declaration sparks a chorus of mocking laughter from the majority of the attendees. "Haha, does he think he's someone important?"

The supporters on the sidelines, tired of debating, simply wave their hands in dismissal, signaling the guards to escort the target away. The sorcerer, however, shakes his head, his eyes fixed on the ground. "I remember this land, where the biggest rule is that whoever has the strongest fist gets to rewrite the rules."

As he speaks, the surrounding area erupts in a cacophony of jeers and catcalls, with no shortage of people eager to participate in the commotion. However, their eyes hold no hint of compassion for life, only a desire for conflict.

The sorcerer's gaze lingers, and he sighs. "I have a question: how can we put an end to the slave trade between our nation and surrounding countries?"

"It's simple: just destroy this land," someone quips.

In other words, as long as this land exists, this trade will never be eradicated!

The next instant, the sorcerer nods thoughtfully. "Good idea."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he turned around, countless mysterious arcane symbols suddenly appeared in the air, and the destruction light burst forth from above and below, coming from all directions and corners. "Deathly Wilderness!"

Suddenly, a chilling wind swept around, extinguishing the breathing of the people who had just been scolding. The black-robed wizard silently walked to the stage, heading towards the iron cage.

The audience, who had just been startled, shouted, "Fake! You're just a trickster!" "I thought you were going to cast some magic, but it's just an illusion!"

The emcee on stage also tightened his grip on his staff, ready to educate this guest on what it means to be polite and respectful.

But the next moment, he realized that his hands had lost all sensation.

At the same time, the entire auction hall fell silent. Countless people felt their bodies begin to wither away, and they all let out painful cries.

"Open," the black-robed wizard said, looking at the lock on the door.

Instantly, the iron shackles on the half-elf girl's wrists fell apart, and the locks on the cage dropped to the ground like mud.

"I feel like we have a special connection," the black-robed wizard said with a mixture of familiarity and unfamiliarity. "What's your name?"

The girl in the cage hesitantly replied, "A, Annyoja."

The black-robed wizard raised an eyebrow slightly. "A very good name. Unfortunately, I don't have one."

The girl felt a bit embarrassed, not knowing what was happening outside, but knowing that the wizard in front of her was involved.

Meanwhile, outside the auction hall, all the land seemed to wither away like a dying plant, as if the life force was being drained from the earth.

With trepidation and shock, the half-elf girl finally managed to escape from the black-robed wizard's encouragement, but was still very nervous and tightly grasped his hand.

"Thank you for saving me, but do you want a name?" she asked.

"Yes?" the girl replied.

"Ernest? The big yellow dog in my family was beaten to death by those evil people, and it was also called this name. I miss it very much."

The black-robed wizard was taken aback and then smiled, saying, "Well, I'll use this name."

However, he looked down at his feet and began to transform, saying, "But I think you still need to give this new land a name."

"Yes," the girl replied quietly.

"Then let's call it the Wilderness of Death," she said.

The black-robed Ernest nodded happily.

... "Teacher, what is the birthday gift you sent me?"

Aniyia, the half-elf girl, was very excited and ran to the study room, where she shook off the wizard who had been reading magic books all night. Ernest, who had been sleeping with his eyes closed, looked at his loyal student of over ten years with a smile.

"Ah, silly girl, how do you know you'll definitely have a gift when you grow up?" he asked.

The girl lifted her chin slightly and her small nose ringed with a faint smile.

"Hmph, of course! The apostles who have followed you have all given gifts when they turned 18. You're my teacher's only disciple, so you must have one too," she said.

Ernest smiled slightly.

He quietly opened the desk drawer and pulled out a gold-plated pendant with a time-reversal amulet. "This is an amulet that can reverse time to a previous cycle after activation. I'm giving it to you as a birthday gift," he said, looking at the lively young disciple with a gentle gaze.

"I hope Aniyia, you will always have the opportunity to regret and change your mind."

Anzhiniya saw that she had received a gift and burst into laughter, her face beaming with joy as if a hundred flowers were blooming. She was thrilled.

"Compared to going back in time, I'd rather live forever with the teacher in this moment," she said with a sly hint.

Euernest, standing opposite her, remained silent and bowed his head.

Anzhiniya's face turned red as she gazed out the window, her heart racing like a fawn. The valley they were in was extremely quiet, with a stream winding its way through it. The stream dropped off sharply and formed a small waterfall, creating a breathtaking sight.

It was spring-like, a wonderful place to live.

Euernest only took out the necklace and stood in front of Anzhiniya after a long while.

"You said you wanted to live forever in this moment?" he asked, questioning.

Anzhiniya's lips curled up into a smile, and she said, "When you brought me back 10 years ago, you were still young and unchanged. I was afraid I'd grow old and grey, but you remained the same as ever."

Euernest listened to her teasing and suddenly reached out and stroked Anzhiniya's hairline, making her face turn bright red.

"Don't move," he said.

Anzhiniya's face flushed, and her heart skipped a beat.

Is he going to kiss her?

Ah?

We haven't even confirmed our relationship, yet he's being so reckless.

But Anzhiniya couldn't resist closing her eyes.

However, Euernest was holding the "Time Reversal Amulet" and directly activated the legendary "Chrono Kiss" spell.

Instantly, the emotional artifact released a powerful necromancy aura.

The next second, Anzhiniya felt a strange sensation at her neck, and she opened her eyes with a sense of loss.

It turns out it's not a kiss, oh, coward!
Ernest nodded slightly, seeming satisfied with his current masterpiece.

"Now that you wear this necklace, you have acquired infinite attributes," he said.

"You will remain at this node in the current life cycle. On the one hand, you will continue to childish behavior due to psychological stagnation. On the other hand, you will avoid all negative effects brought by aging, including death."

"Anny, you will forever be a girl now," Ernest said with a smile, looking at Anny's chubby face.

"I'm not childish," Anny defended herself, but noticed Ernest's face was slightly closer to hers.

Anny also automatically closed her eyes, and indeed, men are all pigs.

But a painful sensation came.

Ernest pinched her cheek.

However, Anny's inner heart was still delighted, thinking that since she had gained eternal life.

Then, they could live a carefree life in this valley forever.

...

The Magic Empire, the Celestial Tower!

This tower, which had consumed the empire's vast resources, was finally completed after numerous years of construction. The tower's intricate patterns were so elaborate that they had almost exhausted the empire's most powerful mages.

However, these originally pampered powerful mages showed no hint of resentment, as they served the greatest and most powerful Emperor of all time, Ernest.

"Teacher, are you really going?" Anny, dressed in a princess's gown, asked with tears in her eyes.

The Celestial Tower pierced the clouds, and thunder rumbled in the sky. Amidst the storm, Ernest remained unmoved, sitting cross-legged at the tower's peak, sensing and waiting.

As he listened to the student's inquiry, he smiled slightly.

"There are some things in our lives that we must face, or we will never know what we've lost," he said.

Anastasia's tone turned grave, "Teacher, are you going to challenge another terrifying world's god? The terror of the old rulers is something you told me about."

Days had repeated themselves for several days, and every day she trembled with fear, fearing that the man in front of her would suddenly disappear.

Ernest, on the other hand, reassured her, "Don't worry, silly girl. As long as I can recover my memories, even if I can't return to the current world node, I'll wait for you in the future."

"We will eventually meet again in the river of time."

"As for those old rulers, who is stronger, only to be determined by personal experience."

Anastasia's emotions, which had been temporarily suppressed, suddenly erupted again.

"Teacher, does a person really exist in your life thread who is so important to you that you would risk losing your life to regain the memory of being with her?" Anastasia lamented.

Ernest shook his head.

"I don't know."

"However, I have seen her shadowy figure through my dreams many times," he said.

"In a room filled with many magical books, she slowly taught me the principles of magic, step by step, even after that. I think she must be the most important bond in my life."

"I think she must be the most important bond in my life," Ernest said.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Anniya's eyes, which had been overflowing with tears, had finally dried up. She realized that she had lost in this battle about love, because she could never replace that position.

Suddenly, a thunderbolt flashed across the sky, as if billions of tons of explosives had exploded simultaneously!

Ernest also sprang up, realizing that he was about to leave this world.

He shouted at the vast expanse of the sky: "I've stolen all the wealth of the current node of King Arthur, using it as a wager to ensure the peace of Anniya for a lifetime!"
"Who can enter the secret realm and find the last 13 magical skills left by me - the end of the world - and become the master of King Arthur?"

At this moment, Ernest noticed that his body was beginning to fade away, as if he had just not enough chips. He took a deep breath, looking at the land of King Arthur.

He uttered his final, lifelong vow:

"Let her live!"

...

"The target has entered the teleportation gate."

After receiving this message, a mysterious girl with a cloak slightly nodded.

At this moment, she was in a dormitory, with a heavy wooden desk in the center, where simple alchemy tools were placed.

On the left was a neat bed, which she had just made by hand. On the other side was a bookshelf surrounding three walls, with books such as "Introduction to Simple Spells", "The Road to Magic: Beginner's Guide", "Exploration of Eight Major Magical Schools", and "Transformation Magic", each written by her one word at a time.

Suddenly, the door pushed open.

The mysterious girl looked at the young man who had entered, smiling slightly.

"Good day, Mr. Zhong Xia. I am your magic instructor, Anniya. From now on, I will assist you in completing your magic training."
The mysterious woman's voice is very clear and melodious.
