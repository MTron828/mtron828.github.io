Chapter 152: Arbitrary Magical Art

"Is this a bit exaggerated?" Rayan stood in the shadow, looking at the door of the 91st lecture hall.

Under the influence of the listening magical art, Zhao Xu described the magical art constructions on the blackboard, and Rayan listened intently without missing a word.

As a nine-ring mage, Rayan didn't need to explore the magical model Zhao Xu drew on the blackboard; he had already guessed about 90% of it in his heart.

Of course, he immediately understood how the 2nd-level mage, Tasi, had suddenly comprehended and upgraded to a 3rd-level mage.

Rayan found the content Zhao Xu was discussing not particularly astonishing.

How could it be like the Magic Goddess was teaching, allowing listeners to upgrade on the spot?

Rayan was standing next to An Ti Noya.

She seemed to look down on Rayan and kept a certain distance from him.

However, after hearing Rayan's question, An Ti Noya still explained: "In his understanding, magical arts are isolated and stagnant. Now, a low-level mage has broken this understanding, so he naturally has a breakthrough and upgrades."

"That's not right, you mean that this logic is only applicable to low-level mages like him, and not to top-level mages like me? It's a bit too intentional, isn't it?"

"Because you high-level mages who have it easy are unable to understand the mindset of ordinary mages who are struggling on the edge of a cliff."

An Ti Noya looked at Rayan with disdain: "You're just thinking that you're naturally talented and that everything goes well for you. Only someone like Zhong Xia, who is a 2nd or 3rd-level mage, can break his illusions. And what kind of high-level mage are you?"

Lai An was taken aback by An Ning's words and was unable to refute them. However, he could only shrug his shoulders and say, "Your Highness is indeed the most skilled mage in Mistral, isn't she?"

...Brook An's lecture notes, which Zhao Xu spent more than two hours writing, were completed in no time, and he felt refreshed throughout the process. Perhaps everyone has a deep-seated desire to become a mentor.

If Zhao Xu hadn't awakened to his knowledge and abilities during the day, he would probably be relying on mysterious knowledge to deliver this lecture. His main focus will be on the origins and development of various magical arts, which is also the reason why Brook An's lecture notes stretched to dozens of pages.

However, Zhao Xu has already obtained that ability, and this lecture has become an opportunity for him to integrate his magical arts. Every time he mentions the structure of a magical art, he is actually re-evaluating his own thought process.

Most mages only master a few dozen or a few levels of magical arts. However, Zhao Xu has mastered hundreds of first-level magical arts, and thousands of second-level arts. This accumulation has allowed his magical perspective to far exceed that of ordinary mages.

As Zhao Xu finished his lecture, he noticed that many people in the audience were eagerly waiting for him to reveal more secrets of the magical arts. Although it's impossible for them to deduce the entire magical model from the simple structures he drew on the blackboard, this lecture has still promoted their understanding and lowered the barrier for them to learn magical arts in the future.

"'I feel like I've grown stronger,' Wang Qingwei whispered to Aisvi."
Here is the translation:

As Esveiwi watched, Zhao Xu seemed to radiate light from behind him, as if he were a master of various magical arts. "It's mainly because senior magicians won't spend so much time studying these low-level spells, and they don't have the patience to explain them to us," Wang Qingwei whispered to Esveiwi.

At this point, Zhao Xu looked down at the audience, recalling the normal lecture procedure, and said straightforwardly: "That's all for the initial explanation. Now it's the Q&A session. Anyone with questions can raise their hand."

Instantly, about ten hands went up in the air.

Zhao Xu didn't hesitate, pointing to the first person who raised their hand, a female magician.

The female magician stood up, looking surprised and delighted, and said: "Thank you, sir, for bringing such a lively and entertaining lecture to us novice magicians who are still struggling to master magic. I---"

Zhao Xu interrupted, waving his hand: "Get to the point, just ask your question."

"Oh, I was wondering, sir, how magicians handle the situation where they need to prepare spells, but seem to be at a disadvantage?" the female magician asked, looking at Zhao Xu with expectation.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before responding.

This question had been answered by many magical texts long ago. The simplest way is to do intelligence work and planning, and there are also specialized techniques and various spells that can be adapted. For example, the simplest way to use a prayer spell is to simulate spells of the 9th level or lower.
Here is the translation:

It's a completely unqualified joke that the female mage slapped her thigh, saying "Ah, it's not up to standard." Eschwish whispered to Wang Qingwei, "She wants Zhong Xia to say the 'Larrio Arcane Conversion' spell, and even show it off. But she didn't expect that the Zhong Xia on stage wasn't an 11th-level mage." Larrio Arcane Conversion is a 6th-level spell that can convert a prepared spell from one mage to another. It's like trading a 6th-level arcane spell for a prepared spell. "Don't underestimate Zhong Xia," Wang Qingwei told Eschwish with a mysterious smile.

At this moment, Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then said directly to the female mage, "Just do some intelligence work."

Zhao Xu's answer was the most official and lacked technical content, equivalent to a formulaic response.

The female mage who was asked suddenly looked embarrassed. She didn't expect Zhao Xu to not follow the normal script.

As long as Zhao Xu said something that was unfamiliar to everyone, even something offbeat, she would naturally emit a surprised gaze and then stare at Zhao Xu with sparkling eyes.

In this way, after the lecture ended, she could naturally discuss the just-explained answer with Zhao Xu.

Who would have thought that the lecturer on stage would kill the question with just one sentence.

At this moment, Zhao Xu suddenly took a few steps forward, crossed the stage, and looked at the silent and attentive mage apprentices and new mages below, saying, "Just like I have prepared the spell you are about to ask today."

The female mage who stood up suddenly brightened her eyes, and immediately reacted.

She knew this was an opportunity left by Zhao Xu for her to cooperate, and she didn't expect to encounter a master today who understood her intentions.

The female mage quickly turned her brain on, recalling what Zhao Xu might have prepared.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xuguang finished explaining at least dozens of spells, many sorcerers in the audience had never heard of them, with no special emphasis or hinting.

The female sorcerer gritted her teeth, unable to bear so many, and decided to directly cast the "Invisibility Spell".

However, just as she was about to open her mouth, someone suddenly shouted from the audience: "Shape-shifting Spell".

The original expectation was met with a burst of laughter from the audience.

The "Shape-shifting Spell" was the first hurdle in the core four transformations, blocking countless people, including these low-level sorcerers who had only heard rumors.

Many sorcerers without the gift of shape-shifting, even if they could cast six-ring spells, were still unable to cast the "Shape-shifting Spell" at the second level.

Not to mention whether Zhao Xuguang had prepared it or not, even if he had prepared it, it was still likely that he would fail to cast the spell.

However, the one on stage, Zhao Xuguang, directly snapped his fingers.

He indeed hadn't prepared the "Shape-shifting Spell", but his "Precognition" had a reserved spell slot, and he could also combine two first-level spells to release a second-level spell through "Multitalented Spellcaster".

This was also the reason he deliberately said so at the beginning: no matter what spell the apprentices in the audience suggested, as long as it was a first-level or second-level spell, he could cast it.

This was Zhao Xuguang's external cheat.

At that moment, all the apprentices stared at Zhao Xuguang, who was casting the spell, wondering if it was real or just a trick to deceive them.

As Zhao Xuguang's body began to shrink, his facial features slowly transformed into those of another male.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "transformation technique" can transform into a biological creature of a similar species with a slight difference in body shape, and it can also transform into another human appearance. This is an extremely strong camouflage effect, and even people who don't know him well may not be able to detect it.

After Zhao Xu completed the transformation technique, the audience in the room cried out in amazement, staring at Zhao Xu and the apprentice who had called out to him to use the "transformation technique". Zhao Xu had transformed into the appearance of the apprentice who had called out to him.

The two of them looked like twins. Seeing that everyone had been impressed, Zhao Xu snapped his fingers to cancel the transformation technique and slowly returned to his original appearance.

Zhao Xu then gestured for the female wizard to sit down and continued to gesture for the audience to raise their hands. However, the following apprentices mostly played around, asking Zhao Xu to demonstrate their desired techniques.

The "smoke wall", "wizard's tremor", "dimensional leap", and "master's touch" - many of these unknown techniques were displayed by Zhao Xu in his hands.

The eyes of the apprentices in the audience gradually changed from expectation to shock.

Only those who were present knew how impossible it was for Zhao Xu to achieve these feats.

"This lecturer is actually a wizard, right?"
"How did you get in here, wizard? How did you master so many techniques?"
"Is it true that high-level wizards can do whatever they want?"

As Zhao Xu finished demonstrating, he directly put down the lecture notes and floated away.

Only later, when the audience rushed to the stage, did they realize that the lecture notes in Zhao Xu's hand were various sketches and paintings, with some ink still wet.

It was clear that these lecture notes had just been completed.
The most obvious line is where the lecturer's name "Buluan" was wiped out with a pen, and then rewritten, only to be wiped out again.
