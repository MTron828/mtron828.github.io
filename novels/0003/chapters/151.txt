Chapter 152 Arbitrary Spells
"Isn't this a bit exaggerated?" Lei An stood in the shadows, looking at the door of lecture hall number ninety-one.
Under the effect of the listening spell, Zhao Xu described the spell structures in the lecture hall, and Lei An listened to every word without missing a beat.
With Lei An's talent as a nine-ring mage, he didn't need to probe into the spell models outlined by Zhao Xu on the whiteboard to guess what they were.
Naturally, he immediately saw how the 2nd level mage, Tasi, had instantly enlightened and upgraded to a 3rd level mage.
Lei An didn't think that what Zhao Xu was saying was particularly earth-shattering.
How could it be like the teachings of the Magic Goddess, directly promoting the listeners on the spot?
Standing next to Lei An was Antinoya.
She obviously didn't think much of Lei An and always kept a certain distance from him.
But after hearing Lei An's question, Antinoya still explained, "In his understanding, spells are one-sided and static. Now that a low-level mage has broken his understanding, he naturally has a breakthrough and upgrades."
"No, what you mean is, this kind of reasoning is useless for me as a top-level mage, but only useful if a rookie like Zhongxia says it?" 
"Isn't that a bit deliberate?" Lei An said discontentedly.
"Because you high-level mages who have had it easy can't understand the mindset of ordinary mages who have struggled on the edge of a cliff."
Antinoya looked disdainfully at Lei An, "If you tell him, he will only think that your talent is so great, and anything is possible. Only someone like Zhongxia, who is only at level two or three, can break his illusions. And besides, what kind of high-level mage are you?"
Rean was instantly unable to refute Antinoya's words. But all he could do was curl his lips, "Miss, you're the most successful wizard in Misterlari."

It took Zhao Xu over two hours to finish Lecturer Bloan's lecture notes, and he felt exhilarated throughout the entire process. Perhaps everyone has a desire to be a teacher deep down. If Zhao Xu hadn't awakened his knowledge and mastery during the day, he would definitely be connecting this material to his knowledge of mysticism. His focus would lean towards the origins and development of various spells, which is the reason why Lecturer Bloan was able to stretch the lecture notes to dozens of pages. But now that Zhao Xu has gained that ability, this lecture has become an opportunity for him to fully understand his own spell list. Every time he mentioned the structure of a spell, he was actually re-evaluating his own thinking. Most wizards only master a dozen or so first-level spells. Zhao Xu, on the other hand, has mastered hundreds of first-level spells, and over a thousand second-level spells. With this level of accumulation, his understanding of spells far exceeds that of the average wizard. After finishing his explanation, Zhao Xu noticed that many people in the audience were eagerly waiting for him to reveal more secrets of spells. Although they couldn't deduce the entire spell model from the simple structures Zhao Xu drew on the whiteboard, this kind of explanation also helped to expand their knowledge and reduce the threshold for learning spells in the future. "Midsummer feels much stronger, doesn't she?" Wang Ningwei whispered to Aisweixi.
"Just by advancing to level 3 as a mage, it shouldn't lead to such a drastic change, right?" Aisweixi looked a bit puzzled as she gazed at Zhao Xu on the stage. For her, who liked to learn all kinds of spells, Zhao Xu at this moment was shining like a beacon.

"Mainly because most high-level mages wouldn't bother to study these low-level spells so thoroughly, and they don't have the patience to explain them to us either," Wang Ningwei whispered to Aisweixi.

At this point, Zhao Xu looked down at the audience, recalling the normal steps of a speech, and simply said, "That's the end of the preliminary explanation, next is the question and answer session. If you have any questions, please raise your hand."

Suddenly, about ten hands were raised in the audience.

Without much thought, Zhao Xu pointed to the fastest-raising female mage.

After being signaled by Zhao Xu to stand up, the female mage looked pleasantly surprised and said, "Thank you for bringing such a lively and interesting speech to us novice mage apprentices who are still struggling to understand spells."

Zhao Xu quickly waved his hand, "Cut to the chase, just ask your question."

"Oh, I just wanted to ask Mr. Mage how to deal with the passive disadvantage of needing to prepare spells," the female mage said in a coquettish voice, still looking expectantly at Zhao Xu.

After hearing this question, Zhao Xu pondered for a moment.

This question had various answers in many mage textbooks.

Doing good intelligence work and planning was the simplest way, and there were also specialties and various spells that could be used flexibly.

For example, the simplest use of the spell "Wish" can simulate spells of level nine or below.

Zhao Xugang just described at least dozens of spells, many of which the other mages had never heard of, and there was no special emphasis or hint. The female mage gritted her teeth, unable to care about so much, and decided to directly gamble on the "invisibility spell." But before she could even open her mouth, someone in the audience suddenly blurted out, "transformation spell." As soon as this voice came out, the originally expectant audience couldn't help but burst into laughter. The second-level spell "transformation spell," as the first level of the core four transformations, had stopped countless people, even these low-level mages had heard of it. Many mages without transformation talent, even if they could cast sixth-level spells, were still powerless against the second-level "transformation spell." Not to mention whether Zhao Xugang was prepared, even if he was prepared for this spell, there was still a great chance of failure. However, Zhao Xugang on the stage simply snapped his fingers. He indeed did not prepare the transformation spell, but his "bizarre foresight" had reserved extra slots for spells, and he could also use "multi-talented spellcasters" to combine two first-level spells into a second-level spell. This was also the reason why he deliberately said so at the beginning, no matter what spells the apprentices mentioned, as long as they were first or second-level spells, he could cast them. This was Zhao Xugang's cheat code. Suddenly, all the apprentices looked at Zhao Xugang casting the spell in disbelief, wondering if he was serious or just trying to fool them with a first-level "disguise spell." They saw Zhao Xugang's figure starting to shrink, while the details of his face were slowly reshaping, gradually transforming into the appearance of another male.
