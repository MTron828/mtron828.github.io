Chapter 648: The Abyssal Scroll

After the meeting, Zhao Xu used the "Short Message" technique to contact Anzhi Noya, expressing his willingness to have a face-to-face talk with her.

Fortunately, Anzhi Noya was in the world of King Arthur at the time, and after hearing his request, she directly used the Higher Transmission to appear before him.

Zhao Xu also recounted his entire adventure in the spirit wave and the subsequent mysterious cave exploration in detail.

The cave was strange, with Arthur's Dragon Crystal, the mysterious old man Wenhua, the mage's personality, the nine swords, the military sword, the white raven's iron heart flow, the mortal's heaven, the spirit god, and the god of death. He also recounted how he re-forged the sword, killed the artificial god of death, and guided the survivors to escape.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu also reorganized his journey through the cave.

In just a few days, he had experienced the thrill and terror that many players might not experience in seven or eight months of adventure.

However, unexpectedly, Anzhi Noya showed no surprise or excitement when she heard that he had obtained the "Iron Heart Power".

When he mentioned killing the artificial god of death, Anzhi Noya raised an eyebrow slightly.

Even when he mentioned that the cave's underground self-proclaimed to be the "Wenhua" of his father, Anzhi Noya looked down her nose, as if she had heard something disgusting.

However, when he mentioned that the "Mortal's Heaven" was originally owned by the "Spirit God Kurosuro", Anzhi Noya's body shook slightly.

Later, the high-level players who had been taken out of the cave also returned to explore under Zhao Xu's organization, following the route he had specified and found the dragon crystal vein.

At this time, over a thousand people were planning how to excavate the dragon crystals at the lowest cost and transport them to the surface.

Anseni also heard that he had such an idea after the heavy rain was about to fall and form a flood situation, and he was urging him to hurry and go together to take out the treasure that had been agreed upon earlier.

However, no matter how many times Zhao Xun calculated it, he couldn't have imagined that it was necessary to first enhance the static panel of his body before taking out the treasure.

At this time, Zhao Xun's six attributes had already broken through.

Power: 53 (8 innate, 6 enhanced by divine power, 5 internal, 30 unknown, 4 sacred)

Agility: 26 (13 innate, 4 enhanced by Siren, 5 internal, 4 sacred)

Physical Constitution: 17 (14 innate, 5 internal, -2 unknown)

Intelligence: 29 (16 innate, 6 enhanced by headgear, 5 internal, 2 unknown)

Perception: 19 (14 innate, 5 internal)

 Charm: 30 (13 innate, 4 enhanced by Siren, 5 internal, 4 sacred, 4 profane)

Although as a spellcaster who relies on divine power to eat, his perception and physical constitution are the lowest, this value, especially the power, is enough to make people suspect that it's too good to be true.

Since the same-name bonus cannot be stacked, the only way for Zhao Xun to enhance his attributes is to increase the "enhanced" bonus.

The power and intelligence are both 6-point enhanced, while the charm and agility rely on the blessing of Siren for 4-point enhancement, and the perception and physical constitution have no enhancements.

On the other hand, the player's most common "Bull's Strength" and "Fox's Cunning" skills, which enhance 4 attributes, are only available at the minute level. Zhao Xun, unless he shows off and uses the skill once an hour, has no practical use.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, for most players, unless they have the "persevering" ability and simultaneously possess the "Divine Power", "Blessing of the Siren", and other magic spells, the most direct way to enhance the value of equipment is still to equip it. However, since Zhao Xu already has the "Chrono-Reverse Amulet" and the "Arsen's Cross", he can't fit in any more equipment.

Therefore, he is extremely curious about how Anniya enhanced his attributes. Zhao Xu's knowledge (dimensional skills) directly searched for all the information about the "Underworld".

Most outer-dimensional planes have complex spatial structures, with multiple layers being common. This is a characteristic that differs from the world of King Arthur. Generally, dimensional transfers directly point to the first layer of the corresponding dimension.

The prefix "Underworld" itself means "infinite layers", and no one knows how many layers it has, not even the most famous demon lords like Gratz, Dimoggo, Ocus, and Flare, who only occupy one layer each. Some demon lords even have to share a layer with other powerful beings.

However, all the layers of the Underworld share a common feature: in the crossed and twisted world, from the air to the water source to the ground, a foul-smelling stench permeates the air. The terrain of each layer seems to be designed to cause infinite suffering and torment for any traveler who passes through. Unlike other dimensions, the Underworld does not have a main road connecting each layer; instead, each layer has a teleportation door or a narrow passageway leading to another layer.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, due to the "chaos" characteristics, these interconnected channels of layers are constantly changing, like a constantly reassembled clay sculpture.

Everything in the abyss follows the chaotic nature of change, even the demon lords do not know how many times they have changed.

The only eternal constant is the "Blood Gap" where the devilish beings of the underworld engage in "blood battles".

The Blood Gap is connected to the first layer of the nine-layer underworld, "Afanas", on one side, and to different layers of the bottomless abyss at different times, with the demon lords continuously deploying their "new recruits" into this eternal and continuous battle.

Anzimo noticed Zhao Xu's piercing gaze and couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong? You seem to be wary of the abyss."

Zhao Xu smiled wryly and shook his head, "Although I've had dealings with a few powerful demon lords of the abyss, I don't have any aversion to the abyss itself, even though I know this is the homeland of the devils."

"That's interesting," Anzimo suddenly said. "Do you know the history of the abyss?"

Zhao Xu looked at him with his over 40 levels of knowledge and skills, and searched for information about a demon lord of the abyss, which allowed him to retrieve some secret gossip, such as the fact that the mother of the 471st layer, Nightshade, lived in a terrifying form that even she couldn't accept, and that any creature who gazed upon her true form would immediately die.

For example, the demon lord "Dihmogren" with two heads, known as the "Double-Faced Monkey", each with its own personality, had a poor relationship with each other, but they could give the demon prince two biological advantages in battle.

As Zhao Xu searched for information about the abyss, he felt more and more fascinated by the magic of this realm.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, regardless of his knowledge (domain) or historical knowledge skills, when trying to retrieve information from the depths of the past, he only gets a foggy impression, and even with notes, it's just a few brief sentences.

Ordinary people often encounter difficulties in using their knowledge skills because the difficulty level of the knowledge is too high, while their knowledge level is too low, resulting in a mismatch.

As for Zhao Xu, he frequently encounters difficulties because the "knowledge" he retrieves, even from the vast repository of knowledge, is limited.

After all, knowledge itself requires "existence" - if Arthur doesn't know about a piece of knowledge and there's no record of it, then the knowledge skill cannot be retrieved.

At this point, Annie Noja looks at the fire and says directly.

"The chaotic nature of the abyss makes it capable of disrupting everything, and it's a power unmatched in its ability to resist."

Zhao Xu also laughs, saying, "Because this world is fundamentally 'entropic', heading towards chaos?"

"This is just a matter of how you think about it. This is the way the abyss exists and manifests the will of the abyss."

"At the summer solstice, remember that the abyss will be your greatest aid on some day in the future. Or, you may find out..."

As Annie Noja finishes speaking, she suddenly falls silent, but she doesn't seem surprised and continues to gaze at Zhao Xu.

"Even the lord of the abyss and the most ancient lords of the abyss don't know the specific layers and characteristics of each layer of the abyss."

Following this, a mysterious inscription appears before her.

The golden text flowing with light even hurts Zhao Xu's eyes, and he can barely keep them open.

"Now, I want you to memorize this inscription."

After listening, Zhao Xu's eyes widen in surprise, but he continues to gaze at the "golden inscription" exhibited by Annie Noja - the bottomless abyss.

First layer, Pazuonia, Lord of the Abyss, Papa Pazu.
Here is the translation of the text:

The second layer, the honeycomb, Lord Tarzax.
The third layer, the forgotten land, Lord Zeikzesia.
...
The 45th layer, Lowen, Lord Gratzte.
The 46th layer, Shadow Sky, Lord Gratzte.
The 47th layer, Vorts, Lord Gratzte.
...
The 66th layer, the abyssal pit of the magical network, Lord Spider Goddess Rosa.
...
The 600th layer, the endless labyrinth, Lord Beast Roar King Baffiment.
...
Zhao Xun looked down and finally realized that this was the specific name of each layer and its ruler, and even the mysterious symbols that followed the names of the rulers, which Zhao Xun couldn't recognize.

Annyoia also read Zhao Xun's confusion and explained, "Those lord names are their original names and the core inscription of the entire layer, which can be understood as the key to each layer."

At this moment, her mouth corner began to bleed slightly and drool down her chin to the ground.

"Teacher!"

Zhao Xun suddenly let out a shocked cry and took a step forward, leaning against her shoulder and staring at her pale face.

From her eyes to her original rosy cheeks, not a hint of blood color could be seen, as if she was a sleeping beauty frozen in an ice coffin.

Zhao Xun had never seen Annyoia so weak since the last time she ignored the old man's advice and went to the 9th hell alone.

Zhao Xun's healing spell suddenly popped up, but then subsided.

He already knew that this was no longer a problem that could be solved by magic.

"Teacher, did you pay a heavy price for that passage of text just now?" Zhao Xun asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the golden seal inscriptions that had appeared were slowly disappearing. However, both of them were clear that with Zhao Xu's intelligence of around 30 points, he could basically memorize any content after a glance, just like starting up a camera at the same time.

"Don't worry about me, I've released the secrets of the abyss. This shock is already the lightest," he said with a bitter smile.

As he spoke, Anzhi Noya revealed a wry smile, "This section of text is the opening of the 'Abyssal Scroll'."

"The Abyssal Scroll?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No mistake, it's a legendary book that records all secrets about the abyss. It's said to be placed at the bottom of the abyss, a place that no one can reach," Anzhi Noya replied.

Zhao Xu looked puzzled for a moment, "But isn't the abyss a place where chaos reigns? Wouldn't the contents of the book become outdated?"

Anzhi Noya shook her head, "It's not that simple. The book will faithfully record all secrets of the abyss. Once changes occur, it will update in real-time."

"Similarly, the 'Final Scroll' can record all the spells Arthur has used. Even if a mage discovers a new spell through research, it can accurately record it. This is one of its unparalleled abilities," Anzhi Noya explained.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, as if he had grasped a crucial thread.

"What's even more astonishing is that the moment the abyss changes, the memory of this opening section in your mind will also change."

"That's the true power of the book," Anzhi Noya said with a cough, her voice hoarse.

"The Abyssal Scroll was also placed later, so it's had readers who have even copied it – Ah'm's Dark Scroll. I'll say more about that later," she added.
Zhao Xu couldn't help but be astonished, "The content of this Deep Abyss Scroll won't have been spread out yet because of its inherent characteristics, and it's unlikely that there's any other knowledge that's superior to it."

However, Annyonja shook her head. "To understand the content recorded in the Deep Abyss Scroll, one must digest the unparalleled chaos of the dimensional forces, lest one be assimilated by it."

"One might become a mere ordinary soil of the Deep Abyss, or be reborn as the lowest-ranked Tan'el origin demon, or even approach the legendary Balor flame demon. It's all possible."

"However, it's undeniable that for most people, having a complete version of the Deep Abyss Scroll in front of them, even reading the first sentence is impossible. Not to mention reading it, just glancing at the title page will directly lead to chaos."

"It's rumored that some divine beings have died after reading it and are still floating in the starry expanse, serving as a warning to later comers."

As Annyonja spoke, she revealed a nostalgic expression. "Even with my exceptional talent, my teacher spent a lot of effort to summarize only a small part for me."

"The Deep Abyss energy that leaked out at the time has already been filtered out by more than 90%. I just showed you this text because I was affected by this segment of Deep Abyss energy and became so weak."

After listening, Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself, "Why didn't I encounter any obstacles when reading it?"
