Chapter 491: Crossing a Thousand Years

At the beginning, Zhao Xū had the "Soul Shield" bestowed upon him by Ana Ti Noya, so he didn't think about influencing his soul in that direction.

However, he still underestimated something.

The "sound" he heard might not be true.

Including the "don't look back" message he heard when Ana Ti Noya disappeared.

True or false meant two starkly different possibilities.

In that instant, Zhao Xū's mind flashed with hundreds of possibilities.

But after replaying the entire situation, he realized it was not difficult to choose.

If Ana Ti Noya had fallen into the pit, then Zhao Xū would feel safer if he fell into the same pit with her.

Or if Ana Ti Noya was knocked out by the Grazzite main king, then Zhao Xū would just be jumping for nothing.

So in that instant, Zhao Xū decided to turn back.

Subsequently, Zhao Xū saw the river of time in the mysterious object behind him.

In the midst of the fireworks explosion, he saw his past life.

In the hospital delivery room, he shook his tiny hands and cried, while the nurse rocking him in a rocking chair. The weak-looking mother on the bed was smiling contentedly. Outside the delivery room, his father was pacing back and forth anxiously.

On the other hand, in the era when humans crossed over, Zhao Xū, who was only two levels above, clenched his teeth and pulled out the giant sword in his hand, charging towards the wild beasts in the wilderness. After a bloody battle, he and his companions dragged back the corpses of the wild beasts, giving his hungry family a full meal for the first time. This was his first time taking care of the family.
In the Battle of Sealing the Demon, a young warrior who had been struck by a demon's punch and had his entire chest shattered lay beside Zhao Xu. At that time, Zhao Xu poured the remaining healing potion into his mouth, but it was too late to save his five viscera and six bowels. This person, who normally resembled Zhao Xu's companion, continued to shout to go back to avenge together, but ultimately fell asleep forever on that land.

The memories of the past flowed vaguely through Zhao Xu's mind.

He saw the changes of the years, the redistribution and accumulation of fate.

Finally, Zhao Xu was drawn into the vortex of time by the power of the light of the years, and he went back up the river of time in reverse.

...One thousand years ago.

Mistral.

Zhao Xu walked on the streets of Mistral again, still hard to imagine.

Everything in front of him and the memories in his mind was similar, yet different.

The search for knowledge and skills clearly told Zhao Xu.

He returned to Mistral one thousand years ago.

Zhao Xu looked down the stone steps, where the originally bustling street had become desolate, with strong winds blowing, scattering fallen leaves.

However, the number of mages among the people was more than in the current Mistral.

At first glance, it seemed like a city for mages to live in.

But there was one thing missing: Anniya.

Zhao Xu realized this.

As the gloomy king Grazz said, he had used the power of the God of Fate, Yegor, to see his "breaker" surpassing fate.

However, Grazz also collected some divine power related to time.

The manifestation of the divine power of time that Zhao Xu saw at that time was what brought him back to Mistral one thousand years ago.

And Anniya was probably also transported back to the river of history.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu was too late to turn around, and it was clear that he and Anniya were not allocated to the same era.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu gazed out in all directions, wondering if Anxi Noya was standing here, watching the passing of time, just like him. Suddenly, Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat.

A thousand years ago!

The era of the Great Disaster!

Zhao Xu immediately called out for a horse-drawn carriage, "Let's go!"

As he spoke, he hesitated and got off the carriage.

The Great Disaster was still a while away, and at this point, the magic goddess Silvina had not yet lit the divine fire, establishing her reputation as a magic goddess.

Or, to put it another way, the present-day Silvina was another form of Anxi Noya, a powerful sorceress.

"Sir?" The carriage driver looked at Zhao Xu's attire and knew that the other was a respected sorcerer from the city.

Pausing for a moment, the driver did not dare to disturb him loudly and instead asked quietly.

"Do you know Silvina's address?"

Zhao Xu asked with a hint of doubt.

This was his first time without any title or honorific addressing the goddess.

"Oh, definitely, I know," the driver replied. "She's a noble from Mistral, and still the most famous sorceress. Many people say she'll be appointed as a goddess's attendant. Shall I take you to her mansion now?"

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

Thus, with the driver driving the horse-drawn carriage at high speed, Zhao Xu soon arrived at a grand estate with a long and spacious courtyard.

"Sir, I can't go any further from here," the driver whispered to Zhao Xu, as if afraid of disturbing those inside the courtyard.

This estate was located in the center of Mistral, but passersby walked with a light step, as if tiptoeing.

Zhao Xu, however, remained silent and got off the carriage, walking straight to Silvina's front door.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

If King Arthur were here, who could help him send Mr. Mistralle back to the real world or send him to the era where Princess Anny is located? Then, it's likely that Xylia, one of the strongest wizards in King Arthur's court, would be his only choice at present.

Outside the door, there are already many visitors waiting, but most of them have been turned away. The maid at the door said calmly, "I'm sorry, but my master is currently entertaining guests. Regardless of your reason, today is not a good day for visitors."

One fat wizard protested, "I was previously scheduled to meet with your master, and I've come at a convenient time." However, he didn't dare to force his way in.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that he couldn't enter the Oath of the Law without the identification proof of the wizard association, and therefore couldn't easily reach the Floating City above.

He had thought that Xylia would be more convenient for communication and wouldn't be delayed by tardiness. Who would have thought that the doorstep of the other party was so unyielding?

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then walked straight up to the guards. The guards looked at the shining wizard badge on his robes and said, "Good day, Mr. Wizard, but the mistress is entertaining guests today and cannot receive outsiders."

The slaves at the mansion looked at the wizard badge on Zhao Xu's robes and said, "Although the style is a bit different, we can tell that you're a four-ring wizard. With your young appearance, you're almost a prodigy."

However, that was that.

Zhao Xu said, "I've come to pay my respects on behalf of the gods."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he spoke, he put another priest's holy emblem on his chest, as the holy emblems of the second and third generations of the magic goddess were somewhat similar, with many open books scattered about.

Zhao Xu's holy emblem, if not chosen by the church for this specific purpose, would be difficult for others to understand the differences between these versions.

"Is that so? I'll spread the word immediately."

The maid standing nearby heard this and didn't dare to raise any doubts, immediately bowing and leaving the place.

However, Zhao Xu didn't even notice, walking straight in.

If Sisilvina was communicating with the high-ranking priestess of the goddess, he would definitely be exposed after spreading the word.

"Sir, the wizard—"

Just then, the servant standing aside tried to stop Zhao Xu, but was intimidated by his demeanor and didn't dare to grab his sleeve.

Zhao Xu also knew what was going on.

Or, when one has read through a period of history, one can easily navigate any time point.

At this moment, a major disaster was about to occur, and the second-generation magic goddess seemed to have already sensed her own downfall in the future.

In the years leading up to this disaster, she had begun to extend an olive branch to Sisilvina, trying to recruit her as a divine being.

However, Sisilvina had always refused.

These servants naturally thought Zhao Xu was coming with the same mission, and didn't dare to speak out or even take a step forward, only able to follow Zhao Xu with small steps.

Zhao Xu looked at the mansion in front of him, and couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. Later, this place would be surrounded and become the "goddess's temple", and the land in front would be requisitioned and transformed into the headquarters of the goddess's church.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mistress is in the parlor, having a conversation with an important guest. A maid whispered to Zhao Xiu, "Master, would you like to go to your room first and have us treat you to a reception?" Meanwhile, the maid who had just delivered the message was approaching with a puzzled expression.

It was clear that she had just returned from delivering the message, unaware that Zhao Xiu had already entered. "Wait, the mistress said that the pastor just arrived yesterday, how can there be another one today?" The maid suddenly blocked Zhao Xiu's path, her eyes wide with suspicion, clearly thinking that he had just lied.

Just as Zhao Xiu was about to pull out some magical items to use as a substitute, another maid suddenly rushed over, panting.

"The mistress instructed that this priest should go directly to the parlor," she said, still gasping for air.

The blocking maid looked at Zhao Xiu with a suspicious gaze, but still followed her duties. The group walked around the two long corridors and arrived at a wooden door with a low-key setting. The maid lightly knocked on the door, and the door automatically opened.

Zhao Xiu didn't say a word and walked forward on his own.

As he entered, he saw a few small tea tables set up on the wooden floor, with two people inside, both barefoot and wearing socks. Zhao Xiu took a deep breath and looked around.

However, Zhao Xiu immediately recognized them from their aura and physical appearance.

The two were Anzhen Noya from a thousand years ago and Westervina from a thousand years ago.

Familiar and yet strange.

"Mr. Priest, you fabricated divine will, which is no small matter," Westervina said softly, striking at Zhao Xiu's heart.
