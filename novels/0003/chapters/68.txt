Chapter 69: The Last Day

After spending time with Ansilvam, Zhao Xu had come to realize a principle.

Whenever Ansilvam mentioned a term that he had no impression of from his past life, it usually referred to an extremely sharp and specialized skill.

He even heard the prompt "Congratulations, you have obtained a new external skill.".

Unbelievably, he was able to get another skill from Ansilvam before leaving the novice village.

Ansilvam then described the effects of this skill to him:

【Specialization: Multiclass Caster
Prerequisites: Ability to spontaneously cast spells.
Effects: Use two identical-level spell slots to cast a known high-level spell.】
"What's spontaneous? Known?" Zhao Xu was perplexed. "Teacher, isn't this a specialization for wizards?"

"Not at all," Ansilvam replied softly. "This was originally a specialization for mages."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, wondering why he had to be spontaneous.

Mages and wizards used the same or even more arcane tables, but they were always inferior to wizards.

Because they could only integrate a limited number of spells into their bloodline, they couldn't cope with most situations.

However, mages could spontaneously cast spells, which meant they could freely cast known spells without preparation.

"Teacher, wizards need to prepare spell slots, but they don't have spontaneous ability," Zhao Xu corrected.

However, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease in his heart.

Couldn't it be that Ansilvam could arrange for him to have spontaneous spellcasting ability?

If so, he wouldn't be a wizard, but a god.
Here is the translation of the text:

Essentially, every mage spends their daily thoughts on what spells to prepare for the day's adventure, often only preparing a few common spells to adapt to any situation. "You have the ability to cast spells spontaneously," Aniyia said as she began to conjure up ritual materials.

"But, teacher, I can't be a level 1 mage and a 1-star mage at the same time," Zhao Xu said, his two lines of 1-star occupations already taken.

"You guys, have you taken a good look at your character cards?" he asked.

Zhao Xu quickly scanned the character card and his pupils constricted slightly as he noticed his priest's abilities.

Zhao Xu brought up his doubts, "But this spontaneous casting ability only says I can convert any divine spell into a healing spell."

"That's the principle, but this kind of spontaneous casting has already met the prerequisite," Aniyia explained. "Since the cataclysmic era, many rules have changed, and accordingly, the priest's spontaneous casting ability has met the requirements."

"However, most mages only have one occupation line, so it's rare for someone to be a level 1 priest, and naturally, they wouldn't discover this point."

Aniyia had already used a mysterious material to create a pen and was drawing a ritual array on the ground.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that there were some things that hadn't been practiced by others who could know.

There was a specialized library in front of him, and he might miss the treasure.

After a while, the entire ritual setup was complete, and Zhao Xu sat directly on the key star position.

Aniyia lit the incense and began to chant the incantation behind him.

As the chanting sound resonated in Zhao Xu's ear, he slowly felt a sense of drowsiness creeping in.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu's entire head was about to nod slowly, the rotation of this joint suddenly woke him up. He suddenly came to, looked back, and saw that the rituals around him had already been erased by An Ti Nuo Ya.

"How long have I slept?" Zhao Xu asked, feeling his throat was a bit dry, as if he had slept for a long time.

"Not even a minute," An Ti Nuo Ya explained. "The specialty of the mage is like this. You have already obtained it."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu relaxed, thinking that if skills like this were common in the world, they would be very convenient.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu reacted, "Teacher, can I use the second-level magic spell now?"

According to the specialty, he could use two zero-level magic spells as a sacrifice to release a first-level magic spell. Or, he could use two first-level magic spells as a sacrifice to release a second-level magic spell. Moreover, the released magic spell could be freely specified, just like the mage.

This was the freedom he wanted.

"Well, but you won't have any second-level magic spells, so you can only use it to counter demons," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

"And don't even think about using it to meet the requirements for leveling up, as the rules of the entire Arthurian system are scattered and chaotic."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

Then, An Ti Nuo Ya directly handed Zhao Xu a small booklet. "Take it, this is your remaining specialty. You can learn it on your own, and there's no need for ritual awakening."

Zhao Xu took it and looked at it. The book was written in dragon language - "Permanence of Magic Specialty and How to Prepare Super Magic."

This was the invincible specialty that could keep magic spells going all day.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Just because I learned it doesn't mean it's useful. Even if it's a permanent spell, I won't be able to use it until I reach level 6."
"Teacher, I won't be able to use it even if I learn it. I won't be able to use it until I reach level 11."
"Just take it and use it. You can use it now. You can use instant cast or extreme effectiveness magic, just like you can't use it no matter what level you are."
"This book is very important. Go back and write a drop of blood on the top page. Only you will be able to see the text if you do this."
"The text will only appear once, so don't try to memorize it. If you flip through the pages, the content will disappear. There's some information on how to prepare for when you're about to cast a spell, you can take a look at it yourself."
Zhao Xu jotted down the teacher's reminders, which was his first time encountering a special magic book like this.

He went back to train his super magical specialization, although he couldn't use it temporarily. However, the teacher wouldn't deceive him.

From the teacher's tone, Zhao Xu was sure he wouldn't be able to use it even when he reached level 11, let alone lower levels.

So it was like having a small defect.

"Well, congratulations. You've completed your mage education already." the teacher suddenly took a deep breath.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu was taken aback. It had only been half an hour since he arrived here.

So he could leave the novice village now?

Zhao Xu was about to react, still planning to hang around here for a bit and get some inside information.

"The remaining skills, you can slowly improve them when you're on your own adventures."

"The members of the 'Final Scroll' organization have entrusted 'Summer' to me as a secret messenger. As the successor, I am now issuing you a task." Anzetta spoke to him with a serious expression.
