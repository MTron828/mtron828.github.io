Chapter 277 The Wrath of the Gods

At the moment when the "lament" was heard, the entire army of ghouls that had crowded the entire moon channel all rushed forward, with many of them jumping directly and trampling over the ghouls blocking the way in front, forcing their way through.

The entire passage turned into a large-scale trampling scene, as if there was a torrent of positive energy behind them that could extinguish everything.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but look back at the path he had come from, but found nothing.

After the undead "shadow departure", it had become empty.

Looking at the way ahead, the originally several meters high passage had been crowded with ghouls.

Seeing this scene, Zhao Xu also let go of the wall and jumped down, his boots landing in an inexplicable "puddle". But at this point, he had no time to spare, his attention entirely on the ghouls ahead.

"Master, should we keep up?" Lux suggested.

"Yeah." Zhao Xu had just come down from the wall for this reason, and immediately walked quickly behind the lagging ghouls, only ten meters away.

The lagging ghouls kept crawling over the ghouls in front, but couldn't squeeze through.

After walking for almost ten minutes, Zhao Xu finally noticed some light ahead in the passage, indicating that the end of the tunnel was approaching.

The distance he had followed allowed him to estimate that the passage was probably no less than a kilometer.

It was likely that there were tens of thousands of ghouls on this passage alone.

Without saying much else, just the army of ghouls on this passage alone, if placed on the "Falling Star Lake" battlefield, it was uncertain whether the players could win.
