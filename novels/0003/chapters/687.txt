Chapter 688: Ernest's Trial

For most biological creatures in Arthur's world, a high-level fighter is far more terrifying than a monster in a same-level battle. However, a monster that can cast spells is even more terrifying. When a monster's body is augmented with a fighter's static panel, the situation becomes insolvable.

Monsters like dragons, which are born with the ability to level up, can also become a sorcerer of a certain level and completely take on a sorcerer's role. The data panel of a monster is definite, and knowing the information allows for targeted strategies. However, a monster that can cast spells is unknown, and no one can guess its true trump card.

When I, Zhao Xu, finally realized that I was facing such an awkward situation. I was facing a "magician-type" or "sorcerer-type" living fossil that could simultaneously cast unpredictable spells while also resisting my magic. This was like a fire that no one was allowed to light.

Originally, I was the only one who could create a "Counter-Magic Zone" and then use my "Iron Heart's Strength" to dispel the restriction. However, I was now facing someone even more bizarre. Furthermore, looking at the over ten binding spells that could be cast in one round, it was clear that this "living fossil" was far beyond ordinary legendary monsters.

At this moment, I was truly grateful that I had been cautious enough to send Zheng Xin'ao and Lu Yu away, otherwise I would have been struck by lightning while trying to pretend to be something I was not.
Here is the translation:

Cautionary note: Zhao Xuwei gently touched the "Withdrawal Badge" he had placed earlier.
【Adventurer Zhongxia, you are currently in the dimensional lock area of the 8th circle, and the Withdrawal Badge cannot trigger the "Higher Transmission Technique".】
In the next second, the "Higher Flash Technique" that allowed him to switch between the material and spiritual states also lost its effect.
Another wave of attacks?

Zhao Xuwei was astonished, but he continued to manipulate his flying ability, directly crossing a distance of over 30-40 meters.

The trees died, the trees came back to life.
Arthur's super-vision spell was countable.
The touching distance of close combat was about 2-3 meters, but for 99% of the spells, a distance of over 1 kilometer would be enough to avoid detection.
Opening up hundreds of kilometers would make it almost impossible to detect.
However, the dynamic warning message on Zhao Xuwei's character panel remained clear.
The 8th circle's "Dimension Lock" spell could create a shimmering green barrier to block interdimensional travel.
Therefore, any door, transmission technique, or initial illusionary body, as well as flash techniques that could enter the spiritual realm would all be ineffective.
However, this 8th circle spell, with a radius of effect of only 6 meters, had been able to envelop Zhao Xuwei, who had crossed such a long distance, just like a solid mountain.

It seems that the body inside this activated cave is probably shrouded in such an effect.
Can the radius of effect of this spell be modified?

Zhao Xuwei thought about this, and his cautious heart became even more vigilant.

"It seems you have finally understood my strength?"

The voice in the void laughed even more triumphantly, "According to theory, even a god entering my body would be subject to my punishment."
"Otherwise, do you think that after Ernest left, the gods would die so easily? The gods are not stupid, they won't just fight to the death without caring." 
This living cellar seemed to return to its chatty mode, as if it had been unable to find someone to confide in for a thousand years. 
Now that Zhao Xu appeared, he explained to him on his own. 
Sometimes, if you don't confide in someone, it's hard to express how awesome you used to be. 
"Are you saying that Ernest's secret stash was essentially a trap, using treasure to lure the gods into your body and then destroy them?" Zhao Xu immediately reacted, asking cautiously. 
He began to slowly uncover the truth of that year! 
Especially in the process of dealing with Antinoya, she never once talked to him in detail, let alone take him there. 
"You finally smartened up. If it couldn't sweep up all of Arthur's wealth, how could it have attracted the gods to leave the divine realm in person?" 
"After many future gods suffered losses, everyone became more shrewd and knew that this treasury was essentially a place of god slaughter, so naturally they lost interest." 
After listening, Zhao Xu felt half of his heart grow cold. 
When he truly sensed the "divine" aura released by the walls around him for proof, the other half also grew cold. 
Because when the magic goddess Sisilvina appeared, he also felt this kind of "true god" aura. 
In other words, this living cellar either really slaughtered gods, hence the residual aura, or it was a true god itself. 
Or it was powerful enough to deceive his true knowledge. 
Regardless of which possibility, it meant that he was only going to be beaten. 
Especially since this "living cellar" honestly revealed these ancient secrets to him, it basically meant that he had no chance of leaving.
Does he have a chance to be reborn a second time?
Zhao Xu even considered this possibility at this moment.
"Hey, are you trying to escape? Let me tell you, I just don't want you to have too many illusions, so that you won't be able to escape after wasting your effort, and you'll end up unable to cope with it." 
"But I'm not trying to scare you, I'm not asking you to give up, young man, put in more effort, let's continue playing this game of chase and escape."
"Don't worry, as long as you make me happy, I can let you choose a comfortable way to die, such as opening a portal and bringing in a few succubus to let you enjoy yourself, and then end your current virgin status before dying."
Listening to this, Zhao Xu almost had three horizontal lines on his forehead.
He finally knew where those "Soul Judgement Demons" he had encountered initially came from!
Even in the abyss, only the blood battlefields would have so many gathered in such a narrow place.
If it were just an ordinary ogre underground city, hiding a dozen or so Soul Judgement Demons for guard duty, wouldn't that be a joke in the multiverse?
Faced with such a morbidly fascinating living pit, he couldn't help but wonder what tortures the gods had suffered before they died.
But Zhao Xu immediately remembered, didn't the other party mention a half-dragon female named "Mio"?
Is the other person leaving?
"I wonder, what is the price you want me to pay?"
People will always encounter stronger people, so it's only natural to be slapped in the face at that time.
Zhao Xu didn't have anything to hold onto, facing someone stronger than himself, it was best to sit down and open a path honestly.
After all, no matter how they looked at it, they seemed to have some connection, at least they both knew Antinoya.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Zhao Xu called out to Anniya-ji, he smoothly entered the lost treasure of the Wangchao.

If he could get out alive, he wouldn't mind temporarily acknowledging a mother.

"Ah?" Zhao Xu was surprised to see that Zhao Xu had suddenly become so fast, and exclaimed, "This is very simple."

"When Ernest created me, he considered the possibility of you, a group of Arthurian geniuses who haven't reached divinity, stumbling upon this treasure by chance."

"You're 20 years old, a dual-talented mage and scholar, and also a curse user and super-magical sculptor. Although you're not legendary, you're at the level of a minor noble. You're an object that needs to be protected and can't be taken lightly."

"Can we just leave?" Zhao Xu asked with a look of astonishment.

"What a great idea," responded the awakened cave.

According to Ernest's words, if you were to leave easily, you would definitely not cherish it, and who knows if you'll have to come back and try again someday."

"Who makes geniuses so confident?"

"However," Zhao Xu said before the other person appeared, "I'll give you a way out, but it's not easy. I'll toy with you like a cat playing with a mouse, and it may take several days or several years to finish this process, depending on your destiny."

"However, you can choose Ernest's trial. If you pass, you can escape safely and even get to choose one treasure from the treasure library."

"However, once this trial begins, it will be extremely swift and fierce, and it's impossible to stop it actively. There's always the possibility of death at any time."
At this time, the activated cellar continued to regain its tempting tone, "So you can play a game of cat and mouse with me first, and when I'm about to play you to death, then switch to normal mode, so you won't lose out."

Zhao Xu calmly asked, "How did the previous Miss Mio choose?"

"Oh? She didn't choose, I just sent her out directly."

"Hmm?"

"I like this saint who walks on the earth. I don't want to make things difficult for her. Is that not okay?" The treasure sneered.

It's okay, of course it's okay.

Faced with this unprincipled treasure, Zhao Xu could only smirk slightly.

Chaos, pure chaos.

"I choose the trial."

"Now?"

"Yes."

He had to be full before he could accompany this malicious activated cellar to play this "endurance battle" cat and mouse game!

And the difference between the two, it's almost like a dragon catching a chicken.

"Hmph, I take back my evaluation of you, boring, really boring."

As the activated cellar spoke, Zhao Xu noticed the surrounding buildings start to deform. The irregularly shattered walls seemed to be instantly polished as if they had undergone a high-quality renovation.

Slowly, the surroundings turned into a "square" secret room, not very spacious, the floor became incredibly smooth, paved with processed white stone slabs.

The room was empty, and in front of the door were two stone statues, carved with patterns of armor on their surface, holding a long spear in their hands, like terracotta warriors.

"Given your boring performance, I've decided to raise your difficulty and let you know that villains die from talking too much."

At this point, Zhao Xu couldn't be bothered to argue with the other party about who the real villain was, and just coldly asked, "What is the standard for passing the trial?"

"Very simple, kill the monsters in each room, and the door to pass through will be created. Keep going until you reach the secret room where my true form exists, then you will have passed the trial."
No wonder.
Even the "door" that he passed through was temporarily created after killing the monster.
It's clear that they're not giving him any loopholes to exploit.
The "phase through walls" of the fifth ring or the "phase gate" of the seventh ring, Zhao Xu can quietly give up.
Thinking of this, Zhao Xu also observed the two stone statue enemies in front of him.
Clay golems?
Zhao Xu had encountered this kind of golem before in the hidden palace of the artifact, but he easily solved it at that time and left no impact, just remembered it was weak.
As for the two stone statues in front of him now, they looked only medium-sized, not the super large size of golems.
Zhao Xu quietly activated "secret vision", but could not see any traces of magic on the stone statue.
The other party was like a black hole of magic, erasing all detection methods, and he even suspected that the other party had cast the "mind barrier" spell.
Completely targeting him.
While Zhao Xu was complaining, he quietly cast a "hand of flame" of the first ring, causing 1-6 points of fire damage.
Perfect probing.
If the same spell is really bounced back later, this damage is not a problem for him at all.
Facing a being capable of killing gods, Zhao Xu naturally wouldn't foolishly think that the other party would simply place two stone statue monsters here without setting some traps for him, he would be completely clueless.
However, when this magical flame fell on the stone statue, it left no trace at all, not even a hint of blackening.
The next second, Zhao Xu cast another "magic missile".
At this point, Zhao Xu had reached the limit of this first ring spell, and when he reached level 9, he could simultaneously cast 5 magic missiles.
Here is the translation of the passage:

Two of the projectiles landed on the outer shells of the two stone statues, while the other three flew towards the surrounding stone wall. Instantly, the magic missile that had been concentrating its power disappeared without a trace, leaving no cracks or marks. It was as if the magic had been nullified.

Zhao Xu slightly nodded his head, already understanding what was going on. However, Zhao Xu was not one to be surprised, and he didn't even raise an eyebrow as he drew his longsword and approached the statues. He deliberately used the minimum amount of force to thrust his sword forward.

As expected, Zhao Xu, who possessed the "Ghostly Strike" technique, easily broke through the statues' defense and his sword plunged into the stone statue's defense by more than three fingers' width.

When the mage encountered a statue, he couldn't use magic to bully it, so he had to think of a new approach.

He transformed into a melee monster and went for a physical attack.

Or, he could do it like this, being a melee expert.

However, the next second, Zhao Xu's face turned stiff.

This was because he had just realized that he had taken half the damage, and felt a stabbing pain in the same location as the statue, with blood flowing out.

It was as if he had just stabbed himself with his own sword.

After using the "Minor Healing" spell to treat the wound on his abdomen, Zhao Xu smiled slightly.

He had figured out some things.

He realized that the damage he inflicted on the statue had been transferred to himself.

At the same time, his Starlight Cloak automatically activated the effect of reducing magic damage by half, so he only took half of the damage.

However, since the damage was his own, he couldn't activate the reflexive counterattack to resist it.

It turned out that he had inflicted damage on the statue, and he would get hurt.

How interesting, truly interesting.

Zhao Xu laughed.
