Chapter 604: The Hermit of the Damned

The portal is essentially a form of magic or supernatural ability, and it is impossible for it to coexist with the "Anti-Demon Zone". This is also the reason why the Anti-Demon Zone cannot cover the "Transmission Lake" below.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and silently understood the course of events.

It is clear that when the "Wailing Tide of the Dead" broke out, countless spirits poured out of the transmission portal at the bottom of the lake and piled up at the entrance of the cave.

This may indicate that on the other side of the portal, it is the lair of the undead creatures that have been ravaging the wasteland.

The source of the "Wailing Tide of the Dead" is pinpointed.

In the past, the Wailing Tide of the Dead did not have the same scale as today's.

Therefore, at that time, the scale of this "cave" was not noticeable, although there were rumors that some powerful forces sent out teams to explore, but there was no subsequent response.

As a result, the matter was quietly dropped.

This time's explosion has almost completely eliminated the undead creatures, making it impossible for them to return to their lair.

As a result, even if Zhao Xu went to the other side of the portal, he would not fall into the predicament of losing his magic.

At least within a one-meter radius of the portal on the other side, he has magic, which means he is absolutely safe.

The magic is a sorcerer and scholar of the ancient tomes, with unwavering confidence in the face of difficulties.

However, Zhao Xu did not rush to enter; he had just been defeated, and now he was completely mentally prepared.

Zhao Xu decided to take his time and directly grasped the "High-Grade Super Magic Wand of Instant Transmission" in his hand, with over ten spells related to the portal flashing through his mind.

"Analyze the portal!"
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, his eyes transformed into a mysterious "law eye" filled with magical power, and his gaze, accompanied by a conical force field, spread away, allowing him to know the information about the transmission portal. It was as if he had once remembered it, and these reports suddenly flooded into his brain.

The first round: he knew that the lake in front of him was a "magic transmission portal" and not an "otherworldly door" spell.
The second round: he knew the opening portal password.
The third round: he knew it was a one-way or two-way passage.
The fourth round: he knew the special circumstances that affected the transmission portal's startup and shutdown.
The fifth round: he saw a glimpse of the domain where the transmission portal led to.

After completing this, Zhao Xu closed his eyes and dispelled the spell. At this moment, Zhao Xu was suspended in mid-air above the glowing transmission lake, as if he were surrounded by a vast, glowing mineral deposit. The light rays shot out continuously, illuminating him like the ripples on the lake's surface.

If Zhao Xu was not in a state of danger, he would have admired the beautiful scenery before him.

The next moment, he switched to the four-ring spell "Perception Transmission Portal".

Along with the spell's light, the transmission portal's surface became translucent and clear, and the scene he was aiming for suddenly spread out on the lake's surface, as if it had become a crystal-like mirror, directly telling Zhao Xu where the transmission portal led to.

However, the spell did not actually connect to this domain, so Zhao Xu could not establish an effective line. He could only see through the spell.

The place he was looking at was still pitch black, but he had already vaguely guessed the destination, which was deeper in the desolate wasteland.

Without hesitation, Zhao Xu directly cast the "Short Message Spell" to return to the designated personnel in "Yan Nan".
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, he cast the spell "Portal Guide" on the portal above, creating a spiritual message that sent the location of the portal to the six people he had designated. The others would always know the direction and distance of this portal.

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu continued to descend, entering the lake.

In an instant, Zhao Xu felt as if he had really jumped into the swimming pool, and the energy around him surged towards his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, covering everything all at once.

When he regained consciousness, he found himself in a dark place.

Using the "Dark Vision" spell from the "Magic Constant" spell, Zhao Xu discovered that he was suspended in mid-air using the flying spell, with the top of the cave behind him, which was smooth and humid.

He was only about four or five meters away from the completely sealed cave floor, equivalent to the height of a two-story apartment.

However, Zhao Xu did not relax and fell to the ground, but instead took out a small stone and waved his hand lightly.

"Light!" he said.

The small stone was infused with magical power and lit up like a torch, illuminating a radius of several meters.

At the same time, the stone, accompanied by Zhao Xu's power, fell freely to the ground.

"Thud." The small stone struck the ground with a stable and smooth sound, with no anomalies.

This showed that the space below did not exist in a "Magic-Resistant Area", otherwise the stone would lose its magical light.

As Zhao Xu walked on the flat surface, he could exit the Magic-Resistant Area at any time, unlike the initial free fall that could not be reversed.

However, his gaze was fixed on something.

At the same time, a clear and cold female voice came.

"Who?" she asked with surprise and inquiry.

It seemed that he had encountered an early arrival.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu raised his vigilance and slowly descended, shouting at the empty space in front of him: "Yan Ni, the solitary star, has been ordered to investigate this ruin."

It was clear that his "small ball" of light had just burst forth in the darkness, and even these people who were already familiar with the darkness had instantly recognized him.

"'Solitary star'? I've never heard of a famous player mage with that name."

At this moment, two women emerged from a concealed giant stone. One of them was dressed in a pure black robe, with purple patterns and golden seals embroidered on it. The other wore a black priestess's robe and held a small round shield and a finely crafted hammer in her hands. Her gaze was vigilant, and her demeanor was fierce.

"Oh?"

Zhao Xu, who possessed the secret eye, immediately saw that the female mage was around the level of a three-ring mage. In this era, she was considered one of the top players in the mage community.

However, the priestess beside her seemed strange, with no magical aura and no holy symbol around her neck, which was quite suspicious.

"Can you introduce yourselves?" Zhao Xu asked calmly, pointing to the position where the two women had just emerged from the wall crevice, including the forest guest lady.

Zhao Xu's question immediately sparked a sense of caution in the two female mages, especially the priestess, who tightened her grip on the hammer as if she was about to strike Zhao Xu at any moment.

"How did you know?" the leader of the female mages asked warily.

"This lady's breathing is too loud," Zhao Xu explained with a smile.

When venturing out, skills of surveillance and listening usually determine who gets the upper hand. If they discover each other at the same time, it's a matter of whose reaction is faster.
Here is the translation of the text:

Like the mage's ninth-ring spell "Preparation", it can prevent one from being caught off guard, giving a moment's delay, and allowing them to react after being hit. Even in the instant when both sides simultaneously strike, Zhao Xu can ensure that his spell will hit the opponent's face first.

Then, the next moment, he will cast a "Invalidation of Secondary Spells" on himself, taking advantage of the fact that the two mages can only cast spells up to the third ring.

The female priestess frowned and asked, "How can you say my little sister's breathing is too loud? What kind of joke is this?"

Zhao Xu just smiled silently and didn't explain.

He couldn't say that his "Listening" skill, after he had stacked it, was already the best in the game.

Plus, his perception wasn't bad, and he could detect people hiding around him, and he was confident he could detect people hiding around him.

At this moment, he was wearing the third-ring spell "Battle Insight", which allowed him to sense magic.

In addition to a 5-grade enhancement in spell identification, within a 30-meter range, he could identify the specific spells of any casters he could see.

He could also use the spell to directly counteract spells with the cost of ending the spell, regardless of the effectiveness.

Under the conditions of "Battle Insight" and "Invalidation of Secondary Spells", Zhao Xu had already defeated the two female mages.

Other players, including Arthur, would also face similar difficulties when facing Zhao Xu, and they would be helpless against him.

As for the other female ranger, she wouldn't even be able to penetrate his 53-grade defense ability and "Stellar Cloak".
Here is the translation of the text:

What's more important is that Zhao Xu still has the "friendly fire" on him, allowing him to use the "star shift" ability to deflect any remote attacks onto other targets within a 10-meter radius. In other words, any arrows flying towards him will only hit his two companions by his side.

As the female mage called out, a girl dressed in chain mail armor, with a face mask, emerged from the shadows behind her.

"Let me introduce myself first. I'm Qing Li, the leader of the 'Rose Sword' guild, a 5th-level mage," she said.

"I'm Qing Lu, a 4th-level priest," replied the female priest.

"And I'm Qing Yu, a 5th-level ranger," added the female ranger.

The two female priest and ranger were wary of Zhao Xu, and their introduction was also cautious.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly comprehended the situation.

It seems that this expedition to the underground cave is indeed a fierce battle, with even the legendary "Rose Sword" guild, which only recruits female players, making an appearance.

And, just like in the past, the three sisters of Rose, who have made a name for themselves, have all appeared at the same time.

"As an official investigator sent by Yánán, I don't remember Yánán assigning the Rose Sword guild to investigate these caves," Zhao Xu asked.

"This land belongs to Yánán, but the caves don't," replied Qing Li, shaking her head. "And besides, after crossing over, we've arrived in this desolate land, where whoever gets there first gets to say what's what."

"Well, that's true," Zhao Xu said, looking at the two sisters, including the female priest Qing Lu. "Is it for the sake of the lost priestess?"

The originally evil camp, which chose an evil deity as their faith in the game, and played the role of the evil camp, suddenly returned to their true nature, becoming good or neutral after crossing over.
However, because they are more than one level apart from the divine camp, they naturally lost all their pastoral abilities. The female pastor Qinglu, who is currently in front of us, is a tragic example of this.
