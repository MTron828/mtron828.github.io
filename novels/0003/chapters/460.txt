Chapter 461: Black Dragon!
After hearing Anzolino's threat, Zhao Xu also silently watched the white dragon Sereus, who was perplexed, and thought that his opponent had finally kicked over the iron plate.

Tiamat, the name of the divine being, was not unfamiliar to Zhao Xu.
Not to mention that he, as a mage who delves into mysterious knowledge, had a profound understanding of the subject.
In his past life, he had spent a great deal of time researching everything related to dragons, including the black dragon, in order to track down his ancient enemy.

Tiamat, the evil dragon god, and Bahamut, the good dragon god, were both ancient deities who had lived for thousands of years, and were considered to be the living fossils of the Arthurian pantheon. They were also one of the few divine beings who were born from dragons.

However, in the early days of the pantheon, they had not yet received the title of "main god," and their divine power was limited by the scale of the dragon species.

Since Ernest had taken control of the legendary dragon empire "Enser", the current "Enser" ruins have disappeared from view. As a result, the divine power of the two has become irreconcilable.

However, Tiamat's titles such as "Dragon Queen" and "Mischief Aftermath" had not been stripped away, and her five-colored dragon descendants were still thriving on the Arthurian continent.

Although most of the five-colored dragons currently treat Tiamat, the mother of the five-colored dragons, with a polite attitude, they do not necessarily believe in her. However, they are also reluctant to speak ill of her.

Now that the white dragon Sereus is saying that it will "swear to kill Tiamat", it's like putting a weak and powerless dragon like him in a hot pan and letting it simmer.
Here is the translation of the text:

Syrus wouldn't dare go back to the Ice Mountain Range to face its enemy, the Frost Giant, even if it meant making a vow of death. "What a stubborn and loyal white dragon, I'm impressed, it's not every day I see someone like you," An Ti Noya said with a hint of sarcasm, looking at Syrus with a mixture of admiration and disdain.

Syrus was taken aback, his face contorted in a mixture of anger and humiliation. "You, a 3rd-level mage, what gives you the right to talk about the same origin?" An Ti Noya sneered, pointing at Syrus. "If you were a legendary mage, I might give you some credit."

As a naturally born 3rd-level mage, Syrus was far inferior to the ancient dragons, who were like 13th-level mages. Compared to the ancient dragons, Syrus was like a mere mortal. In the world of magic, Syrus was like a child to the legendary mages.

Syrus's face turned red as he licked his lips and said, "Actually, I'm just a 5th-level mage, I'm just a bit stronger than ordinary white dragons."

"Level 2 mage?" An Ti Noya asked immediately.

Syrus nodded hesitantly, still looking embarrassed. "No," An Ti Noya said suddenly.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also began to scrutinize the "white dragon" in front of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu noticed that the other party looked puzzled and didn't know where they had slipped up, he opened his mouth and said, "It's not easy for the giant dragons to become 'magicians' before they evolve into ancient dragons. Because the power of magicians is inscribed in their blood vessels."

"So most giant dragons can easily take on other basic professions like warriors, but taking on the profession of magician is extremely difficult. Without the persistence and willpower, it's impossible. And you, with your lazy appearance, don't look like a bright spot in the giant dragon clan."

It was no wonder that the white dragon in front of him looked at him with an expression that was unlike that of a wild beast.

Magicians are said to be the innate profession of the giant dragon clan, but it's a profession that can only be obtained through age and experience. It's not possible to suddenly take on this profession.

The white dragon, Silurus, had already reached the age of maturity and was equivalent to a 3rd-level magician, combined with the level of a 2nd-level magician, making it equivalent to a 5th-level magician. Even when it reached the era of ancient dragons, it would be equivalent to a 15th-level magician, unlike the ordinary white dragons that would only reach a level of 13.

The dragon's face was contorted in a mixture of reluctance and hesitation, its scaly head adorned with wrinkles and creases.

This mouth could easily swallow a person whole and spit out frost to instantly freeze a group of soldiers. Silurus didn't dare to speak again, afraid of exposing more of their secrets.

It sat there motionless, like a stuffed toy cat.

"Logically, a white dragon like you, with no special talent and no innate ability, cannot possibly surpass the ordinary and become a magician. This suggests that you must have had some unusual experiences?"

As An Tiya said this, her face suddenly turned cold, and her eyes flashed with a hint of light. "I remember that there is a temple dedicated to Tiama in the Ice Mountain Range. Have you been there?"
When he heard this, Bai Longma immediately looked nervous and said, "I don't know what the adventurer is trying to say with his words, being so humble and all."

"You know that wizards have the ability to detect lies," Anzhiya said menacingly. "If I discover that you're lying, I'll make an example out of you and turn you into a specimen."

Her tone was surprisingly calm, as if she was simply proposing to create a specimen like a leaf specimen.

Hearing this, Serus's face turned pale, and his already pale complexion turned even whiter and more translucent, with the snowflakes falling on him unable to conceal it.

"I've dug up many tribes' nests in the Ice Mountain Range, but I don't know which one you're referring to, wizard," he whispered with a hint of luck.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile, clearly thinking that this white dragon was trying to brush off the topic.

However, Anzhiya could mention the shrine of the Ice Mountain Range, and there was no room for the other party to brush it off.

At this point, Zhao Xu also began to combine his mysterious knowledge and religious knowledge with local knowledge to retrieve information.

Although Tiemate's followers were mostly five-colored dragons, there were still some humans and humanoid beings who joined her church, worshiping the dragon goddess Artemis.

Anzhiya continued to ask, "Tiemate's shrine often chooses the nest of a giant dragon that has been dead for a long time. I'm asking you, have you ever entered a similar nest, or are you going to tell me that you're a pure and honest dragon who has never stolen or stolen?"

As Anzhiya's tone rose silently, the threatening implications in her tone became even more evident.
Here is the translation:

Even if snow is falling on them right now, it would immediately be dispelled by the "Endure Environment" spell and melt away the piercing cold, but the icy cold from Anzhi's words still lingered in the ears of the giant dragon for a long time.

The white dragon, Selsius, said with a sly glance at the two of them, "There are several nests of dead dragons, but I'm not sure if this is one of them?"

Anzhi let out a soft sigh and said, "Generally, there will be murals of the dragon queen in the inner sanctum of the temple. She is usually surrounded by various giant dragon offspring and revered by countless humans and humanoid beings."

Selsius, the white dragon, was taken aback by this, having not expected that the group of wizards who relied on knowledge as power would actually describe the temple's layout with such accuracy.

It hesitated and said, "It seems there is such a temple..."

"Deep within the temple, there will be several nests, where young dragons from five colors will live. However, they usually don't stay long before new residents arrive. You might have lived in the temple before."

Selsius suddenly shook his head in shock, "How dare I stay in the dragon god's temple? I was just... I was just..."

As soon as he finished speaking, he realized he had let slip, and his expression turned fearful as he gazed at the others.

According to the stories of human heroes, this is when the adventurers would ask him about the temple's whereabouts.

Then, they would contact the benevolent god's temple nearby, organize a force, and set out to destroy the temple.

At this point, Selsius could imagine how these human adventurers would raid the temple, plunder its riches, and then leave with a wink.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he Serus, he would definitely be caught as a second-rate dragon and taken away by the remnants of the dragon's forces, bound with five flowers and transformed into a "undead white dragon" or a "skeleton white dragon".

Thinking about this, Serus's fragile dragon heart began to tremble with fear.

Annie seemed to have read Serus's thoughts and couldn't help but laugh, saying, "We haven't been this boring."

"But what about the statue of Tiama, the one with the appearance of the 'Dark Lady', or the colorful dragon form, or even the aggregate body with multiple heads?"

Hearing this, Zhao Xiu recalled something.

Tiama's sacred emblem, which consisted of five colorful dragon heads surrounding a central circle, was the legendary five-headed dragon emblem.

Historical records showed that Tiama's true form was a dragon body with five necks and heads, which was why it was revered as the origin of the five-colored dragon.

At this moment, Serus the white dragon was also recalling something, and after a moment of contemplation, he spoke softly, "Reporting to the powerful and beautiful wizard, I accidentally entered the temple when I was young, and it seemed to have been abandoned for some time, with no sacrifices of magicians, red copper cups, or other positions."

"However, I saw a massive dragon-like statue inside the temple, and when I looked at it, I could even feel the divine power emanating from it, as if the great dragon god was gazing at me. After I escaped from there, I found that my mage level had increased by one level, and my IQ had also risen slightly."

"Its specific form was a single-headed 'black dragon'."

Black dragon!

In an instant, Zhao Xiu's heart was shaken, and he couldn't calm down for a long time.
