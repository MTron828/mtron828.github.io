Chapter 126: The Grand Magician

"'Are we at the final act?' Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise as he asked."

However, An Ti Noya didn't respond, her gaze fixed on the front as she whispered, "Let's lift the curtain."

"Teacher, which one is it?" Zhao Xu had already taken position at the center of the twelve-faced mirror.

He looked around, noticing that they were all basically identical, including the way the curtains were arranged and the distance from the ground floor, which were all consistent.

"It's as if someone deliberately used a measuring tape," Zhao Xu said.

"I don't know which one it is. Why don't you try to figure it out?" An Ti Noya stood outside the circle of mirrors, whispering.

Hearing An Ti Noya's words, Zhao Xu began to circle around, trying to find a clue.

"Idiot, you're really looking for it, but you'll only find something by chance. If you can find the difference, the setting for this grand magician will be so ashamed that they'll want to die. Hurry up and pick one randomly."

Zhao Xu quickly turned back around and explained, "Teacher, it's not that it will appear..."

But Zhao Xu didn't even finish speaking before he directly shut up and walked over to lift the curtain.
Here is the translation:

However, the duplicate mirror that was supposed to be his enemy's did not have any luxurious decorations, but was just an ordinary mirror. It looked like it was made with today's manufacturing technology, with no significant difference.

Zhao Xu gazed at his reflection in the mirror and thought to himself that he probably hadn't just got the right mirror that led to another world.

Suddenly, the Zhao Xu in the mirror laughed.

Immediately afterwards, the figure in the mirror began to cross over the mirror and approach him.

"Separation technique."

A black light flashed down, and the Zhao Xu in front of him, who looked just like him, suddenly disappeared, turning into nothingness.

Earlier, Ryne had also demonstrated a separation technique in creating an illusion, but he didn't know if the mages had a natural fondness for separation techniques.

Zhao Xu saw Anzino nodding in satisfaction with his operation, so he also continued to lift the second curtain.

"No need."

After stopping Zhao Xu, Anzino walked slowly in front of him, "I just taught you the way for beginners. Now I'll show you my way."

Zhao Xu said, "Teacher, actually, you just need to teach me and tell me. Don't waste a sixth-grade spell, it's too dangerous. If I accidentally hit me, I'll be done for. After all, I look exactly the same as my duplicate."

"You still have a revive stone, don't you?" Anzino said with a sweet voice.

"Teacher, that's a revive stone, right? Revive stone?" Zhao Xu emphasized strongly with a bite of his teeth.

"Revive stone, you know. I don't have one, but I have a similar method," Anzino explained, "I'm starting to cast the spell. Pay attention."

Zhao Xu smiled, but couldn't really take it seriously.

Suddenly, a mysterious energy emanated from Anzino's entire body.

The entire space was filled with a powerful repulsive force, making Zhao Xu feel extremely uncomfortable. His entire body felt empty and hollow.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xu reacted, he realized he had no magical powers at all. Along with that, the backpack behind him also felt lighter. Zhao Xu quickly stuck his hand into the bag's pocket, only to find that he had touched the true structure of the Howard convenience bag for the first time. It turned out that stretching his hand in wasn't a dimensional space. Suddenly, he realized - sixth-level reversal magic!

He was in the legendary "reversal field" and Anzhiyao had just finished casting the spell without giving him a glimpse, so he couldn't even activate the most basic spell recognition.

"Explain the effect of this spell," Anzhiyao asked.

"The barrier of the reversal field will cause the effects of spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and magical items to lose their effects," Zhao Xu said immediately according to what he had learned.

The reversal field is the only way out for warriors fighting mages.

Mages who are in the reversal field are indeed the weakest.

Therefore, a normal mage will never easily enter someone else's reversal field or give the enemy the opportunity to get close and cast a reversal spell.

Mages will even prepare countermeasures, and if someone tries to cast a reversal spell, they can suppress it.

The reversal field has a radius of 3.5 meters, which is the biggest flaw of this spell.

"You now know the effect, so hurry up and open all the mirrors," Anzhiyao said with a bad temper.

At this time, the enemy duplicates in the mirrors all turned into ordinary mirrors due to Anzhiyao's "reversal field" spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as An Ti Na was about to answer, the fourth mirror on the stage had already answered it. A faint glow was emanating from the mirror's surface. "You're right, but not including the sacred artifacts," An Ti Na said, while also walking up to observe the glowing mirror. Zhao Xu looked at the mirror and could only bitterly smile, thinking about the sacred artifacts in the floating city that would also inflate.

He had seen three of them in one day. At this moment, the repulsive pressure dissipated, and Zhao Xu suddenly felt his magical powers restored.

An Ti Na had removed the "Anti-Magic Field" spell. The feeling of regaining power also made Zhao Xu let out a deep breath.

It's no wonder that people say that a true man cannot be without power for a day.

Just now, he had lost many magical powers, and his body felt hollow and empty, with no abilities whatsoever. Although those magical powers were not strong, they had given Zhao Xu a sense of immense security.

But then Zhao Xu suddenly looked at the girl in front of him. An Ti Na had just dispelled the Anti-Magic Field, which meant she had also lost her magical powers.

But An Ti Na wouldn't be panicked, would she?

"Don't look at me with such passionate eyes, or I'll think you have some special intentions," An Ti Na said, looking at the copper mirror behind Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu was only forced to change the topic at this time. "Teacher, what are you doing?"

"Deciphering and casting legendary spells," An Ti Na explained.
Here is the translation of the text:

Immediately, Ana誰s began chanting incantations with precision, and Zhao Xu felt a sense of strangeness for the first time.

As he spent more time with Ana誰s, he sometimes felt that her magic didn't require incantations, poses, and other elements.

Suddenly, the mirror in front of him burst into a yellow light, and Zhao Xu was pulled by an immense gravitational force. In an instant, the two of them disappeared.

The curtain fell, and the room was plunged into darkness.

Then, the curtains began to move by themselves, erasing the slight differences Zhao Xu had noticed. The floor started rotating, like a clock, and the mirrors kept changing their positions.

Next, they waited for the arrival of the next visitor...

When Zhao Xu opened his eyes, he found himself in front of a massive circular library, with countless books stacked to the sky.

Above them, a giant wheel-like structure hung.

"What?"

Zhao Xu wouldn't forget this scene, even after half a month. He had previously sat on the throne of the Oracle King, crossed the river of time, and seen the third-generation magic goddess before she became a goddess. At the time, he had mistakenly misunderstood the female mage.

"Welcome to the final scroll," Ana誰s said, reciting her welcome words to Zhao Xu.

By this time, Zhao Xu had realized.

Ana誰s had brought him to the final scroll, which recorded all the magic in the world, but he didn't expect that the scroll would transform into a massive, gigantic library.

In other words, the books stacked to the sky were actually individual spellbooks.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In this place, all you need to do is say the names of those spells, and the corresponding spellbooks will fly to your face, available for you to learn."
"You can now write down in your mind all the spells you want to learn."
Anzhen smiled and said.

Zhao Xu was surprised to find that the extremely strict "Ultimate Scroll" that had been locked away was actually being allowed to be touched by him, and he could even copy these scrolls for free, which had never moved him before.

"Don't think about it, close your eyes, and the list of spells will appear in your field of vision," Anzhen urged.

Zhao Xu followed the other's instructions, closed his eyes, and indeed, a dark field of vision slowly revealed a few sparks, and gradually, the names of all the level one spells floated up.

"These level one spells are too many," Zhao Xu exclaimed in amazement.

As a gift from the goddess, he had originally only recognized the core level one spells.
Now, he was seeing an entire list of level one spells, which was equivalent to a huge reduction in restrictions.

"Not to mention, Paladin, Holy Warrior, and Druid, these professions' unique spells haven't appeared?" Anzhen asked again.

Zhao Xu smiled, "They have."

Just as he finished speaking, Zhao Xu said with an incredulous tone: "Are you telling me that I can also learn the unique spells of these professions?"

In the art of magic, basic spells of mages and sorcerers are similar, but there are still a few unique spells that are exclusive to sorcerers.

For example, the "Wings of Protection" spell that Anzhen had previously used to defend Zhao Xu is a level two sorcerer's exclusive spell that mages cannot learn.
Here is the translation:

Mysticism is the same, too. Most mysticisms are available to both mages and druids, but each has their own unique mysticism. Each profession has its own exclusive spellbook.

Anshenya told him now, "The spellbook of the Ancient Tome is not just that, it's all mysticism, all magic, and all spells that Ancient Tome scholars can learn, including those exclusive to each mage."

"So, we call them Ancient Tome scholars, all-around spellcasters," Anshenya continued with a clear and crisp laugh.

"This is what it means to be an Ancient Tome scholar, the true source of their strength."
