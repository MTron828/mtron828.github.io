Chapter 224: One Touch and Ignition

After obtaining the result of "Divination", Zhao Xu was lost in thought. Just a moment ago, he had divined the premise of his divination, which indicated that he would be sent to "Star Lake" by the horse.

The "Divination" itself could only predict the outcome of his actions within the next half hour. It was the "Prophecy" technique, which could only be used by advanced practitioners, that could predict the outcome of events within the next week.

The accuracy rate of the "Divination" was not 100%, but rather maintained at around 70% to 90%. The accuracy rate would increase by 1% for every level of mastery. The results could be classified into four categories: "auspicious", "inuspicious", "auspicious and inuspicious", and "neutral".

"Auspicious" meant that the outcome was beneficial, while "inuspicious" meant that the outcome was unfavorable. "Auspicious and inuspicious" meant that the outcome was a mix of both, and "neutral" meant that the outcome was neither good nor bad. If the prediction failed, the result would also be "neutral".

Zhao Xu had expected to get a result of "auspicious and inuspicious", indicating a mix of good and bad outcomes. However, the clear result he obtained was "auspicious", indicating that going to "Star Lake" would be beneficial to him. Although it did not mean that the transmission portal was located at "Star Lake", it was enough to suggest that he would have to go there.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and quickly made plans for the next few days. He thought to himself, "I'm not the younger brother I used to be in the floating city. Now, I'm the big brother. I've been the chief of Star Lake for a few years after its reconstruction."

At this moment, Zhao Xu walked back into the bedroom, where the three others looked at him with a nod, welcoming him to come and sit down.
Here is the translation of the text:

Nowadays, 1st-level mages who venture out in the world are no longer looked down upon as they were in the past, and have become a promising asset.

Zhao Xu's intention is to head to the "Star-Falling Lake" and he won't resist the arrangement in this regard.

After he sat down for a close observation, he noticed that the slender player was actually a "Half-Elf".

Compared to Arthur's Half-Elf, this player's Half-Elf has not yet felt the profound difference.

They just live in cities inhabited by humans or gathering places for Elves.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu rarely sees races other than humans in the surrounding towns.

Because Elves and Dwarves have their own towns, after all.

However, Half-Elves are naturally discriminated against, carrying a tragic tone.

Half-Elves are the offspring of humans and Elves, born from a 350-year-old species and a 70-year-old species. Love will fall like a shooting star due to the short lifespan of humans.

Additionally, Half-Elves can live up to half the lifespan of Elves, but due to their short growth period, they cannot quickly learn the profound culture of Elves.

When Half-Elves reach the age of 100 or more and enter old age, Elves are just entering adulthood at this time.

Zhao Xu had previously interacted with an Elf girl, and the only feeling he had was that the other party was slow.

Imagine a species that begins preparing for vocational training at the age of a hundred or so. They're hardly getting anywhere.

"What's strange about me?" the slender Half-Elf mage apprentice asked Zhao Xu, noticing that he was staring at him.

"No," Zhao Xu smiled and shook his head, having lost his train of thought.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, little brother, they say you're not a native mage. What are you doing here in Winter City, which is not very peaceful lately?" Rui Ye, a first-level mage, asked Zhao Xu.

"I have a task to find something," Zhao Xu replied.

"Old Brother, when will you reach level 2, and can you take us with you?" A chubby mage apprentice asked.

"Not that fast, actually, I haven't even finished adjusting my intelligence and haven't learned some spells yet," Rui Ye said, lowering his eyebrows.

When he said that, the other two mage apprentices also couldn't help but sigh.

"It's really tiring to learn a spell."

"I'm the same, I thought there was no limit to learning spells, especially with Arthur's magic. Who knew that after reaching zero-level magic, the time to learn other spells would be a day? I don't have that much time," the chubby apprentice complained, holding up his mage robe.

"Fortunately, I'm wearing a robe with no effect, and I don't need to find a blacksmith to repair my armor like a warrior. I can just sew it myself. I've never sewn clothes before, and now I've even reached level 1 in sewing just for this stupid game."

The chubby mage apprentice complained, but his eyes couldn't help but reveal a hint of pride.

"Don't complain, fat boy. We used to think this profession had no future, but now we have big brothers above us, which means it must have prospects," the half-elf apprentice, who was a classmate of Rui Ye, said.

"That's right," Rui Ye, the class leader, summarized.

"The 4th-level big brother has finally given us mages a chance to breathe a sigh of relief. Those warriors are always bragging about leveling up quickly, but next year they'll be 10th level and we'll be 2nd level. Who's eating whose tail?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu heard that there was a player who mentioned his 4th-level achievement, which made him think about it. However, Zhao Xu didn't pretend to be indifferent about it. He was lucky and had leveled up quickly, so he wouldn't deny it.

In reality, in a class, even if everyone scored 60% to 70%, the top scorer would score 80%. But then, a genius would suddenly appear, scoring 100% and leaving a gap of 20% compared to the second place. Compared to the gap between the top scorers and the underperformers, the gap was huge.

After that, the 100% scorer would become a legendary figure. "It's nothing, everyone will try harder and will eventually reach 4th level," Zhao Xu comforted the situation.

Just then, the chubby apprentice spoke up, saying, "But I'm not brave enough to think about it. However, at least we now have a glimmer of hope, knowing that someone has succeeded on this path. Before, many apprentices in the wizarding community were worried and felt hopeless, thinking that they couldn't master the skills."

The half-elf apprentice also put down the book he was reading and summarized, "I'm sure that the wizarding profession is not satisfied with a certain characteristic and will never reach 3rd level. This game, Arthur, is absolutely achievable."

"That's definitely the case, but I think the wizarding profession will rise in the future. You haven't noticed that, have you? The major profession associations, including the wizarding association, are the most luxurious and have the highest-quality receptionists. Even without a government official's identity, you can't get close to that kind of thing."

Zhao Xu was surprised by the three wizarding players in front of him. It seemed that he was still far away from the players' ecological circle, even when he understood them from the forum.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Arthur won't let players level up to level 3 mage.

But without 12 intelligence points, it's indeed impossible to cast a two-ring spell.

"Don't say it, at this moment, my most valuable possessions are these potions," the player Ruo Yu said, taking out three bottles of potions and placing them on the table.

The other two people stared at them with wide eyes.

As apprentices, they had heard of the abilities of magical potions.

Generally, magical potions correspond to the same-named spells, and drinking the potion is equivalent to casting that spell on oneself.

In the later stages, people usually only use potions like "heal x damage" in battles.

Potions are only used in emergency situations, and it's hard to part with them.

So, when they heard what the other said, they couldn't help but feel curious.

"Light wound potion, I've heard it can quickly restore 2-9 HP of life value," Ruo Yu said.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, as there was no time to rest for hours in the battlefield.

So, restorative potions can quickly restore life.

Each of the three bottles of light wound potions on the table costs 50 gold coins.

However, considering Arthur's lack of healing positions and the high price of potions, everyone has taken the approach of stacking defense and trying to take fewer wounds.

Therefore, the high defense armor that floated up as players entered.

"Ah, old instructor, you're really poor. I thought you'd take out a 750-gold flying spell potion," the chubby apprentice said with a snort.

"Hey, do you think magic items are that easy to get?" Ruo Yu said with a scowl.
Here is the translation:

"You see, the quality of this Zhongxia magician's cloak is quite good, isn't it?" Suddenly, the apprentice who had learned tailoring skills noticed Zhao Xu's outfit and said, "And where did you get this yellow copper single-lens glasses? They look really cool!"

Zhao Xu was about to explain when suddenly, loud noises echoed from the corridor.

The half-elf, who was sitting by the door, got up and opened the door to take a look outside. "The mine owners from Starfall Lake are involved in human trafficking. After the frontline players discovered this, they resisted their behavior, were killed, and then resurrected in the temple. Now we're going to take revenge!"

Instantly, the three of them stood up, filled with indignation. Even though they thought the residents of Arthur's village were just data, after spending time with them, they had become quite vivid and lifelike NPCs. Now, however, such a disgusting thing had happened. Who could bear it?

Zhao Xu, however, walked back to his original position and picked up the "Giant Scythe".

For a long time, he had been afraid of causing a butterfly effect, which would lead to the outbreak of the "Starfall Lake War" and make the evil deep in the Starfall Lake remain hidden.

Unexpectedly, he still had an impact and even accelerated the event by three days.
