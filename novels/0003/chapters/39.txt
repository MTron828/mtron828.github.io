Chapter 4: Invalid and Immunity

Hearing Anni's words, Zhao Xu's expression turned slightly bewildered.

Hit?

Talk about how easy it is?

Zhao Xu was just a 1st-level mage, and he thought he could hit Anni with a 1st-level spell?

He didn't take any reckless action, but instead raised his guard, looking at Anni with a serious expression, as if he was the defensive side.

If there were no spectators in the ring, it would be reasonable to think that he was the one on the defensive side.

Anni looked at Zhao Xu and nodded slightly, seemingly satisfied with his cautious behavior.

"Don't worry, there's a condition: every time you attack me, the method I use will not be repeated."

The entire ring-shaped arena was filled with Anni's echo, and the words "will not be repeated" were clear.

"Immunity?" Zhao Xu asked, following up.

Some negative spells that take effect are all subject to the caster's immunity (one of the three: resilience, reflexes, or willpower).

Anni was born with a high level of immunity, not something a 1st-level mage like Zhao Xu could pierce.

"We're not betting on whether it takes effect or not. If you make me use immunity, I'll count it as a hit."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu suddenly realized that Anni wasn't trying to show off his strength.

Instead, he was trying to let Zhao Xu feel the various ways a high-level mage can defend against an opponent's attack.

As Zhao Xu thought this, he no longer felt excited or anxious.

Suddenly, Anni remembered: "By the way, you just used a 1st-level spell, and you only have another 1st-level spell left. For fairness' sake, here's the scroll of the magic missile spell you just used."
Here is the translation of the text:

A scroll unfurled, drawing a beautiful parabola, and landed perfectly in Zhao Xu's palm.

Zhao Xu casually took it and took a deep breath.

He now possessed three zero-level spell slots, one first-level spell slot, and a magic missile scroll.

As he breathed evenly, Zhao Xu eliminated all emotions that affected his thinking, and any gain or loss seemed to disappear into thin air.

He stared intently at An Ti Nuoya, who was about 10 meters away from him.

In an instant, Zhao Xu had a fleeting thought, as if An Ti Nuoya was casting a spell.

He quickly blinked, but saw nothing.

In the eight major schools of magic, there are divisions into protection, shaping, incantation, necromancy, illusion, transformation, control, and prophecy.

Zhao Xu had covered all schools with zero-level spells and had only six first-level spell slots.

The spell he chose for An Ti Nuoya had limited options.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu directly pulled out a pouch of spell materials from his cloak and grabbed a handful of powder mixed with red, yellow, and blue colors.

As he grasped the spell materials, he raised his hand and began to chant the incantation.

Seven-colored spray!

A dazzling, multicolored beam of light, shaped like a cone, appeared in front of Zhao Xu.

This spell took only a standard action to cast, and Zhao Xu completed it before he even had time to pull out the materials.

The area covered by the spell, with a radius of nearly 5 meters, immediately enveloped An Ti Nuoya's body as well.

Although An Ti Nuoya had exceeded level 20, with a life total of over 20 HD.

However, the seven-colored spray spell could persist indefinitely because even a being with 5 HD or more could be stunned for a period of time.
Here is the translation of the text:

If one cannot move, it means that one has lost most of their defensive capabilities, and is in a state of "intimidation" that is extremely domineering. However, when the light scattered away, Anzhi Noya still showed no reaction, as if nothing had happened.

"The spell resistance has directly countered your spell. I will abandon spell resistance, and you can continue."

Anzhi Noya's words were very calm, as if nothing had happened at all.

Zhao Xu shook his head, trying to shake off the daze.

Spell resistance and immunity are two major siblings of Arthurian magic. Most controlling attack spells on enemies require first breaking through the enemy's spell resistance and then their immunity, in order to take effect.

However, spell resistance is generally only possessed by monsters or other species, and humans do not have inherent spell resistance.

Now it seems that Anzhi Noya has been given a spell resistance by Zhao Xu.

Or, she may have had spell resistance from the start.

Zhao Xu's actions did not pause, and he directly grasped the scroll given to him by Anzhi Noya and began chanting the incantation on the top.

Another magical projectile composed of magical energy appeared in his hand and flew straight at Anzhi Noya.

This time, he was already familiar with the spell.

The magical projectile could penetrate spell resistance but ignore immunity.

However, just as Zhao Xu was about to strike Anzhi Noya, a shapeless wall of energy gathered in front of her, and the magical projectile disappeared into thin air, not even touching the hem of her clothes.

"Fourth-level spell, secondary spell boundary, effective against spells up to level three. I will abandon this spell, and you can continue."
When he heard these words, Zhao Xu finally felt the suppression of a high-level mage against low-level magic.

Isn't this spell cast by An Ti Nia, who was unable to perform fourth-level magic even when he reached level 7, rendering him powerless?

However, Zhao Xu was not discouraged and did not say something like "oh well". Instead, he focused his attention and re-analyzed An Ti Nia, thinking of a way to proceed.

After using up all his level 1 spells, including scrolls, he now had only three level 0 spells left.

This also meant he had three more chances.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu continued to chant the spell directly.

Acid splash!

A small acid ball suddenly condensed from Zhao Xu's palm and flew towards An Ti Nia.

This level 0 spell could deal 1D3 acid damage to creatures within short range and did not require saving throws or resistance.

However, this projectile spell was subject to remote attack rolls, similar to Zhao Xu's projectiles, which could be dodged or blocked by the opponent's defense.

But An Ti Nia remained as still as a wooden carving, and the small acid ball was about to hit her when it suddenly dodged out of the way at the last moment.

It landed squarely on the ground with a faint splashing sound.

The surface of the competition arena, which had been corroded by the acid, quickly recovered to its original state.

An Ti Nia seemed to have never been the target of the spell.

"Makes no sense," Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

If the acid ball had simply disappeared, he wouldn't have said a word.

But why was this happening?
Here is the translation:

"The fourth-level magic beam is slanted, immune to remote contact attacks, including beam magic and biological beam attacks. I'll give up on this magic, and you continue."

Hearing Anzhiya's words, Zhao Xu could only surrender.

Other people don't even need to roll for it, and it's directly immune.

The next sentence is also advising him not to try to use beam-type magic again.

At this moment, Zhao Xu discovered that he was already sweating slightly, and his forehead was about to drip. Anzhiya's stance, waiting for him to launch an attack, gave him too much pressure.

Zhao Xu suddenly had an idea.

He wiped the sweat on his forehead with his hand and evenly spread it on his palm, using it as a magical material to cast the "Fatigue Touch" spell.

The blue light gathered on his palm until the spell was complete.

Zhao Xu immediately charged forward, and by the time he reached Anzhiya's reachable range, he swung his arm towards Anzhiya.

Anzhiya is immune to remote contact attacks.

So what about his close-range contact attack?
