Chapter 338: Divine Secrets

"Say, don't I seem like someone who keeps secrets?" Zhao Xuan consoled Lei An, saying, "At least I'm a priestess of the goddess, and I'm more trustworthy than you."

Lei An's face changed expression, and his words didn't quite sound convincing.

Initially, he didn't intend to say much, but Zhao Xuan's reaction was faster than usual, and he had already guessed a thread of clues.

"Still, the goddess cannot descend from the Holy Heart Cathedral?" Zhao Xuan suddenly said.

"What, the goddess told you?" Lei An was startled and almost turned his head to look at Zhao Xuan.

As a liaison officer, he had honed his "negotiation," "intimidation," and "deception" skills through magic, so his facial expression was automatically controlled.

"About a week ago, the goddess gave the Pope a revelation, and within this month, she will only descend from heaven in emergency situations. Although no one knows what's going on, the high-ranking officials of the church will not rashly ask the goddess for a miracle unless the situation is extremely urgent."

"And they won't dare to reveal this information, so no one knows that the goddess is currently in a state of semi-dormancy."

It seemed to make sense.

Just like before at the Star Lake, he could ask for "miracles" as easily as drinking water.

Although he had a "divine blessing," others like the Pope would not be weaker than him, and they would rather compensate him with another kind of "resurrection" instead of asking for miracles. They were already a bit out of sync.

It was only in situations like Lei An said that everything could be explained.

The more he knew, the more he worried.
Here is the translation of the text:

"And another reason is that the Abyss and Hell have been collecting information on divine power for many years, trying to take advantage of the gods. Therefore, if an event related to demons and devils is involved, and the other side has the backing of powerful god-like leaders, the gods will be cautious. Especially in a place like the temple, where resonance is easy to trigger.

As a result, the Abyss and Hell will send out more minions to gather more information on divine power, which will actually put the gods at a disadvantage in high-level battles.

By this time, Zhao Xiu had pieced together the entire picture of the event in his mind.

So, for the next hour, he just needed to stay outside and keep the "Devil's Pastor" from leaving or choosing other weak targets.

Meanwhile, many powerful individuals in the church had set a deadline to capture the Devil's Pastor.

If the deadline was exceeded, they would directly intervene with divine power.

"Ah, did you feel a strong sensation from the time we started to now?" suddenly Li An asked.

"Are you talking about the power of the Abyss?" "Yes, otherwise, I wouldn't have brought you along for a wild goose chase."

Zhao Xiu responded straightforwardly: "No."

"This is strange. Why would they deliberately disguise themselves as a novice pastor?" Li An was astonished.

At this moment, they were walking past some training rooms and lecture halls, where some junior pastors were also present. They were still unaware of the huge changes happening outside.

"Is there new intelligence?" Li An asked.

"You're clever. Guess which aspect?"

If Zhao Xiu's intelligence hadn't been improved, he would sometimes be confused and need to clear up the relationships between different clues. Now, with a 22-point intelligence, the overall framework of the connections in his mind was clear, and he was constantly analyzing the relationships between different clues."
After hearing Peter's question, he was speechless, saying, "So, it seems that the only thing that can be investigated is that 'Peter' thing, and it's the reason why that demon wanted to make him become a half-demon creature."

If that demon just wanted to cause a commotion, it would be reasonable. However, the other party was trying to do big business at the Holy Heart Cathedral, making a big deal about it, which was hard to justify. It's because that demon was carrying a divine artifact and the power of the Abyssal God, indicating that it was involved in a major event of the Abyssal Lord, Grazz't.

The demon clan had been waiting for thousands of years to climb the ranks, and after making a mistake, they would suffer a hundred-year punishment in the Abyss. Even without a brain, the demon would still act in accordance with the principle of maximizing benefits in Mistral.

At this point, Rayan explained, "Initial judgment suggests that the other party's teleportation method is to consume this 'half-demon creature', and it must be a half-demon creature with at least 1st-level magic."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly after listening.

This revealed that the demon's actions were not limited to just today.

Peter had thought he had transformed into a powerful "half-demon creature", but in reality, it was just the demon cleric's trick to replace his body with a teleportation fuel.

Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrowed in concern.

He noticed that the other party was from the same class as Zheng Xin'an and was a novice player on the cleric path.

This meant that Zheng Xin'an would be taking the same courses for the next few days, and the demon would be lurking in the shadows, following him to the same classes.

In the end, they would meet Zhao Xu, who would be giving them a lecture, just like the old cleric from today.

Could it be that he was waiting specifically for him?

No.

Zhao Xu immediately corrected his judgment.

It was better to set up an ambush at the Ministry of Culture.
Here is the translation:

It seems that the other party is waiting for him at Peter's home, and there is no need to wait for him at the most dangerous "Sacred Heart Cathedral". At this moment, the demon seems to be uncatchable, and it is lurking in the cathedral with ease.

In reality, the high-ranking officials of the entire organization have likely mobilized several legendary wizards to research and identify this demon.

If they are not misled by the intelligence of the "today" operation, and they continue to wait and ambush, there is already a probability of over 50% of successfully capturing this demon.

Or the church may not have realized that they will find this demon so quickly, and this has forced the other party to take action.

If Zhao Xu's speculation is accurate, the demon does not know who it is looking for, or it is just waiting for the "target" to appear on the lectern of the novice pastor.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu gripped his "Legendary Life Staff" more tightly.

If everything is as he speculated, the demon may not have recognized him as the target yet.

"Wait a minute," suddenly, Léa waved his hand to signal everyone to stop.

He lowered his head and listened to the feedback from the cathedral's upper echelons in his ear.

"Just a moment ago, we detected the demon's trail in the northwest corner of the cathedral. It seems that the target is not you," he said after a while.

Later, Léa reorganized the message he had just received.

"Now, the church has re-deployed its surrounding forces, and several legendary wizards have rushed to the scene. According to the current analysis, it is estimated that the opponent can be temporarily confined."

"Based on this, the church has rearranged its plans. You should return to a nearby secret base, where there are enough Rose Crusaders to ensure your safety."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Come on, I'll quickly escort you to wherever it is, and then I'll head to the battlefield," Lei An said, and then directly led Zhao Xu away from this building, while also giving orders to the two attendants behind him to go ahead and provide backup.

However, as Zhao Xu watched the two mages disappear into the distance, he couldn't help but feel puzzled.

Because he noticed that the two of them were only at the sixth ring, and they didn't seem to have an absolute advantage over the demon.

"They're going to provide magical positions," Lei An understood Zhao Xu's confusion and smiled with a hint of admiration.

"Next, we're going to perform a legendary spell, and we need these high-level mages to provide magical positions to reduce the difficulty of the spell."

Lei An said this as he took out a small, intricately carved wooden box from his pocket and opened it, revealing a small, glowing crystal inside.

Legendary spells, after all, are spells with no limits.

Whether it's power or magical range, or even the specific form of the spell's effects.

It's also the dream of many mages.

But legendary spells are inherently difficult to cast, so many times they need a team of assistants to provide magical positions to reduce the difficulty of casting.

At this point, Zhao Xu and Lei An walked into a small, circular chapel with walls covered in vines and no signs of human maintenance.

Then they walked upstairs, and Lei An led Zhao Xu to a secluded corner, where he lightly knocked on a blank ceramic tile.

Suddenly, the originally white wall slowly rose, revealing an internal alchemy ascension ladder.

"This is the hidden location of our Rose Cross, responsible for guarding some things, so it's set up a bit off the beaten path, and the entrance is not just one," Lei An said, and then directly operated the control panel on the ascension ladder, causing the metal gate to suddenly open, revealing a narrow, half-meter-wide space.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu stepped directly into the room, and when he turned around, he saw Lei An stumble and almost fall, but he managed to walk in steadily. Then, the door of the elevator slowly closed.

At this point, Lei An and Zhao Xu were standing side by side in the alchemy elevator, both looking at the floor panel numbers, which were flashing down one by one, all the way to the unknown depths of the underground.

Suddenly, Lei An turned around, with a benevolent smile on his face, and said to Zhao Xu, "Do you think I look like Lei An?"
