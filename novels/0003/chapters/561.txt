Chapter 562: The Sorcerer's Seed, the Saint Descends

As soon as these words were spoken, Zhao Xu's heart was shaken. It was as if he had been slapped in the face. He couldn't help but think that even the legendary wealth gathered by the ancient civilization of Atlantis, which was said to be hidden away, was just a mere facade. After all, it was nothing but a trap set by the powerful magic empire of Ernest to collapse from within.

Moreover, behind the "treasure" library, there was another "false" library. The treasures stored in it were only a fraction of the true library, which was once the lost inheritance of the Itel Kingdom.

Zhao Xu had followed Anzhenoia and called her "older sister" before passing the test of the "activated vault" to gain permission to enter. At that time, he obtained the "Star Cloak" within.

Zhao Xu still remembered being dazzled by the rows of magical artifacts in the treasure room, his eyes almost unable to open.

Now, Anzhenoia was telling him that even the true library was just a facade. The true value lay in the "Sorcerer's Association", which seemed powerful but was actually composed of individual strongholds, each with its own basic foundation, struggling to maintain its dominance under the supervision of the Sorcerer's Association.

This was also the reason why the Sorcerer's Association controlled almost 90% of the sorcerer practitioners in Artesia, but failed to establish a new magic empire.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unless otherwise, there won't be "Ultimate Scroll", "Mystic Alliance", "Spellguard", or "Rose Cross" and other independent organizations that are not under jurisdiction and have strong independence within the Association.

"Is there a secret of great importance within the Association that the mentor doesn't know about?" asked Zhao Xu.

Facing this question, Anniya Noya lightly shook her head and changed the subject, saying, "What do you think the common Arthurian magic power is, Zhong Xia?"

Zhao Xu didn't know why Anniya Noya had changed the subject, but continued to explain based on his own knowledge system, saying, "It's like five rings or above, and it's already very rare for someone to exceed that level. For some remote small countries, a seven-ring mage is already sufficient to influence the succession of power."

Zhao Xu spoke very straightforwardly, but in reality, it's only a few powers like the Eastern Empire, Northern Alliance, and Western Kingdom that have tens of cities. Most are small countries that occupy a region and have autonomous governments.

Many times, a small country may only have a temple with a few high-ranking gods, and the entire country's faith will converge on a single god.

Legendary mages are more like extraordinary individuals.

In their daily lives, they often experiment with magic in their mage towers or half-planar spaces, occasionally take in apprentices, or simply experience life, hiding in some small villages.

According to legend, there are two legendary mages and three nine-ring mages hiding in a village 100 kilometers away from the city of Mistralia. If someone recklessly breaks in, they may encounter an unforgettable and painful experience that they will never want to recall. Even a peaceful death would be a great blessing.
Here is the translation of the text:

Generally speaking, many powerful magical practitioners who have broken through the limitations of mortality are hiding in various places. They only appear when there is a significant change in dynasties.

"Teacher, as you said earlier, are you going to lend me the secret legacy of the Itter Kingdom to help me establish Yulan?" Zhao Xu returned to the center.

"That's natural," Annyon said with a nod, "but it's also conditional."

As Annyon said that, she gently pressed Zhao Xu's shoulder, as if conferring an honor.

"I need you to establish a magic academy in Yulan and begin recruiting students," Annyon said.

"And don't worry about the faculty issue, I will arrange for the secret forces of the Association to provide assistance. The key issue isâ€”"

"Source?" Zhao Xu quickly reacted.

"No mistake," Annyon stood on the small hill, with the wind blowing her cloak and rustling it loudly.

"This time, we need a seed."

"It concerns a crucial plan of ours, and we need to cultivate a batch of brand new, completely pure and untainted magic practitioners from scratch. The Earth's travelers are within our scope, and only they meet the condition of having no influence or infiltration from other forces."

As Annyon said that, her eyes seemed to gaze through the long river of time, looking at the same sky as Zhao Xu.

"Are you being cautious even when teaching in Mistral, not to mention representing the Association?" Zhao Xu asked with a serious tone.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's okay." Anzhi nodded slightly. "You once discovered a student who had taken a leave of absence from the Ministry of Magic in Mistral and was found to have become a half-demon after receiving training in floating city, and before entering the floating city, he had already become a target."

"The floating city is too big, and it's hard to block people's gazes and attention."

"Divine power is ultimately a more pure form of magic that can achieve many unimaginable miracles."

"Just one person among the tens of billions, selecting a seed for a wizard apprentice?" Zhao Xu asked.

He had already realized that there must be a massive plan behind this, requiring a batch of pure background wizards as backup forces.

Just like the components of legendary magic, the power and difficulty of a legendary spell are closely related. You can set up an "unbeatable" legendary spell, but this requires a tremendous amount of "magic recognition" level to cast.

If the recognition level is not enough, you need to manually reduce the difficulty of the spell, and there are ways to add mythical materials such as "cold fire" or increase the casting time.

There was once a legendary wizard who researched a doomsday-level legendary spell, but it took exactly one thousand years to cast, and no legendary wizard has been able to successfully cast it for one thousand years.

In the end, it can be concluded that the most useful and effective way for legendary wizards to improve their spellcasting success rate is to let wizards with a ring level of nine or above contribute to the spellcasting process and work together to cast spells.

The more people involved, the more stable the spellcasting process becomes, and eventually, a legendary ring magic is formed.

Therefore, Zhao Xu guessed that Anzhi needed something like a "spell" or "ritual" that involves a massive number of wizards.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That mentor, aren't you supposed to start earlier?" At this moment, Zhao Xu had already seen the group of Earth-crossing travelers who had gathered below because of their appearance, and they had already caused a commotion. Many people had turned to look in another direction.

On a distant mountain, a cavalry team had created a whirlwind of smoke and dust as they charged forward.

As the cavalry team raised their divine flags, it was clear that they were the Knights of the Divine Library of Justice and Retribution, dispatched to rescue the people. They had traversed thousands of miles through the transmission array to get here, bringing food and faith.

For Arthur's chief deity, they had already reached the point of immortality, unless it was a disaster of the level of the gods' twilight, in which case they would not fall.

However, deities below the chief deity would determine their own divine power based on the scope of their followers. For example, if Anzhiya didn't like a weak deity, she could easily define the scope of their followers and, with a single wave of her legendary magic, annihilate all of their followers, causing the weak deity's divine kingdom to collapse and its soul to scatter across the starry sky.

Therefore, this disaster on Earth was also a "feast of faith" for Arthur's deities.

As for who could reap more faith, it was up to individuals to rely on their own abilities.

This was also the reason why the deities did not hesitate to invest a considerable amount of strength and power to achieve their goals.

"I'm a little different," Anzhiya said confidently. "I need elite mages, not ordinary followers."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if you can only find one person, as long as they have unwavering faith and won't betray or be tempted by higher powers, that would be enough."

"So, you entrusted this task to me? And just me alone?" asked Zhao Xu.

"That's definitely not the case," said Anzhi Noya with a smile. "There are also trusted people who are searching, but you are undoubtedly the most crucial part."

"Because you can seamlessly connect and continuously transmit across this vast land. I also need your ability to sustain indefinitely."

"Moreover, this time the key to the mission is secrecy, and we cannot attract any attention. Some wizards are only entrusted to execute a specific task, or even just to act as a middleman, and they have no idea what the ultimate goal is from start to finish."

"Moreover, the Barren Land has also sent wizards from Mistral, and they are also selecting suitable magic apprentices for the Floating City. They will draw all attention to themselves."

"Only you know everything and will participate in the entire process for the next week."

At this point, Zhao Xu looked at the priest of the Just God and the Saint Warrior approaching, and realized that he and Anzhi Noya needed to leave this place.

He couldn't help but ask, "Teacher, you've gone to such great lengths to set up this isolation, making me even more curious - what kind of plan are these seed wizards working towards?"

"Don't regret it after you've heard," Anzhi Noya suddenly laughed with a joyful tone.

"How is that possible?" Zhao Xu was very confident.

"I told you that God is not in July, it's May's prophecy, but we didn't expect that the Gods' Kingdom had a problem."
Here are the translations:

"The gods are intervening in the chaotic wasteland for the first time this summer, and the power of those who have crossed over the earth may exceed your imagination."
"Sages will descend to the mortal realm, and it is almost here."
