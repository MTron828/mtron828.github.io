Chapter 111 The Third Method (Part 2)
When Zhao Xu heard the name "high-grade divine tool," he suddenly felt that nothing on the table was appetizing.
"Mentor, it can't be that serious." In theory, Antinoya was not that kind of petty character.
After spending these days together, he had already faintly felt that Antinoya, not to mention divine tools, even as the president of the Mage Association, she had little interest in the position of dominating countless resources above tens of thousands of people.
"I can't give this to you because I think you'd better not take it. But if you really want to play with it, I can let you have some fun."
With that, Antinoya's bright eyes under her cloak looked at Zhao Xu and leaned forward slightly, "Just, are you mentally prepared?"
"Such as?" Zhao Xu moved his butt back slightly.
"The anger of the dragon." Antinoya said word by word.
"Dragon balls can enslave dragons, so those who possess dragon balls will be seen as enemies of the dragon clan. There happens to be a golden dragon near the Tian Duan Mountains, which matches the properties of this dragon ball. It's possible that you will appear as a dragon knight in Mysterla, which doesn't sound too bad."
Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu could only take it in stride.
Originally, he could have returned to Mysterla smoothly, but now taking this dragon ball would truly prevent him from returning.
But he immediately realized that Antinoya, holding it, would also have to bear the consequences.
"Mentor, aren't you afraid of the dragon clan's hatred towards you for holding this dragon ball?"
Here is the translation:

As An Ti Nuo Ya sat back down on the sofa, facing Zhao Xu, she said, "I've killed the embodiment of Tyarma in the past on this continent. As for the evil dragon, you should be worrying about it, not me."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu finally had a clear concept of his mentor's strength for the first time.

Tyarma is the evil dragon god. Even in its embodiment, it's a top-tier combatant.

"That mentor, why don't you introduce me to these things and see which ones are suitable for me?" Zhao Xu looked at the items on the table, including a scepter, a shield, and even a one-meter-by-one-meter mirror, which was covered with a cloth and seemed to be quite cumbersome to carry.

If it weren't for the cloth covering the mirror, Zhao Xu was about to lift it up to take a look.

"Yes, I'll ask you, what methods do you want to use to protect yourself?" An Ti Nuo Ya asked directly.

Zhao Xu heard this and began to think deeply, and An Ti Nuo Ya remained calm, gazing at him without any impatience.

It wasn't until the incense smoke had burned halfway around that Zhao Xu finally spoke up slowly: "Mentor, is there a method that can be pulled out instantly and used to counterattack and sweep away all enemies?"

"And it should be able to adapt to various complex situations," An Ti Nuo Ya added.

"Yes, yes, yes," Zhao Xu replied enthusiastically.

"Oh," An Ti Nuo Ya thought for a moment and then took out something from her dimensional bag and handed it to Zhao Xu. "Here you go."

A second "Prayer Candle" appeared in An Ti Nuo Ya's palm.

Zhao Xu was suddenly overcome with a moment of awkward silence.

This thing can summon different creatures and meet various complex situations, and it can sweep away all enemies. The main issue is that he already has one...
"Mentor, no kidding." Zhao Xu knew that Antinoya was deliberately pretending to be silly to amuse himself.
"Okay then." At this point, Antinoya stood up and walked to the nearby bookshelf, pulling out a thick encyclopedia and handing it to Zhao Xu. "First, memorize the last few pages for me."
"Mentor, didn't you just give me the list after the candle prayer?" Zhao Xu flipped to the last few pages and asked in surprise.
"That was the list, this is the details. Otherwise, you won't be able to use the third method." Antinoya let out a light laugh.
After Zhao Xu had finished accepting Antinoya's third method, he felt a bit unreal the whole time.
Even when Antinoya deliberately used an acceleration spell to speed up time, Zhao Xu wasn't too surprised.
After Zhao Xu left, Antinoya took off her hood and revealed a look of distress on her face.
Through that legendary prophecy spell, the last image she saw was Zhao Xu appearing drenched in the reception hall of the Arcane Gate.
...
Looking at the middle-aged man in front of him, Zhao Xu suddenly understood after hearing the man's question.
The price for picking up the dragon ball back then had come.
Combined with the golden dragon soaring through the sky at that time, the answer was already obvious.
Zhao Xu couldn't help but lower his head and look at his right hand, wondering if he had only picked it up and not really owned it?
Thinking of the series of data about the golden dragon, Zhao Xu's scalp suddenly tingled.
The dragon race is the kind of race that automatically improves in strength as they age. After enduring 1200 years, a young dragon will evolve into an ancient dragon.
Here is the translation of the text:

An ancient golden dragon with a challenge rating of up to 27 levels is not to mention the various numerical values of that day. They themselves can cast spells comparable to a 19th-level mage and can also cast additional priest spells.

This is a more powerful mage who can also grasp divine magic.

The middle-aged man, with a faint mustache on his lower jaw, looked at Zhao Xun with a smile.

"Looks like you've recognized my identity?" he said.

"You, a low-level mage, should not be able to slaughter dragons?" he chuckled softly.

"Not dared," Zhao Xun said, his face awkward, but his heart began to think about the effectiveness of his prayer candle and how not to let it be extinguished by the torrential rain.

"This 'floating disc' effect is not bad, and it has already gained autonomy. I remember it was only able to follow the caster before," the middle-aged man said, despite being battered by the rain, he remained completely steady.

Even to the point where it seemed as if he was swimming in water.

"After the research association discovered the fourth-level spell 'Higher Floating Disc', they also upgraded this spell," Zhao Xun explained.

"Mages can continue to research and refine spells, pushing magic civilization to the extreme. It's no wonder you can secretly control the world behind the scenes," the middle-aged man said, as if recalling something.

"However, since we've met in this rain, how about we introduce ourselves?" he said with a smile.

Zhao Xun nodded slightly, but his face turned red, and he looked like he was about to die.

"Summer, Mister Strala, 2nd-level mage of the Mage Association."
The translation is: "Canchas, the Tian Duan mountain range, according to your human definition, should be a ancient golden dragon."

Note: The original text appears to be a poetic description of a mountain range in China, with "天断山脉" being the name of the mountain range, and "坎帕斯" possibly being a reference to the ancient city of Kanpas in China. The text is using a metaphor to describe the mountain range as an "ancient golden dragon", which is a poetic way of describing the grandeur and majesty of the mountain range.
