Chapter 678: Simultaneous Release of Ten Spells!

As the battle raged on, the battlefield was shrouded in chaos, with the sounds of screams and retching intermingling. The demons, covered by the spells, seemed to be paralyzed, some struggling to stay upright, while others clung to their comrades for support. The human side, however, was launching a more intense attack, but they were careful to avoid crossing the boundaries of the misty area.

"Team Leader, older brother!"

At this moment, Zheng Xin allowed a nearby demon to fall to the ground. Despite her face being smeared with demon blood, she looked resplendent in her heroic pose.

With the "Paradise for Humanity" in Zhao Xu's hand, she struck the demons with ease, as if chopping vegetables.

Zheng Xin tilted her head to the side and asked, "Why not just use fireball magic to take care of these demons?"

In theory, the coverage range of fireball magic was consistent with the spider web and stinky cloud spells. It could cause people to feel nauseous and demons to suffer from fiery injuries.

Zheng Xin was confident that Zhao Xu had ways to inflict massive damage, allowing them to take down these monsters with one hit.

Zhao Xu shook his head, saying, "You're thinking too much. Why would I let you fight these demons with your long sword?"

"You don't feel the thrill of being on the brink of life and death? I've already done enough by helping you guys take down these demons. If you keep going, you'll just be boasting. Do you really think you'll gain anything?"

Zheng Xin finally understood her team leader's intentions and couldn't help but lower her head in embarrassment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's undeniable that just now, I hacked away so wildly, making her feel incredibly exhilarated, chopping down anyone who got in the way, as if it were a game of relieving stress.

At this time, Zhao Xu also completed the "Magic Show" spell, helping to clean the bloodstains from Li Er's face.

"That team leader, can you make it even harder?" Li Er curiously asked, "These demonic creatures in the mist are not just waiting to be killed, they can still defend and dodge these attacks, right?"

"Of course," he replied.

Zhao Xu glanced at the battlefield ahead.

"Black Tentacles."

As the giant squid tentacle materialized as a spell material, it turned into a light mist.

The originally solid ground on the frontline battlefield suddenly erupted with countless dark, unyielding black tentacles.

They seemed to emerge directly from the target creature's feet and then wrapped tightly around the target like a snake.

On one hand, these demonic creatures were immediately bound by Zhao Xu's four-ring "Black Tentacles" spell, unable to move.

On the other hand, the black tentacles, once wrapped, would constrict the target creature, causing 5-10 (1D6+4) damage each round.

"Team leader, this setting is a bit too nasty," Li Er couldn't help but complain, watching the scene of the black tentacles.

These black tentacles looked like something from an ancient comic book, making her feel uneasy.

"This spell is not wrong," Zhao Xu justified, "This is to let you experience a few classic 'curse system' control spells, including the remaining fog and death cloud spells."

"This spell is very impressive?" Li Er asked again.

"It's definitely true," Zhao Xu explained, "No saving throw, no spell resistance, it's all about wrapping it up."
Here is the translation:

"Meanwhile, the basic attack power is equivalent to the spell level, and with 19 strength, it can be said to be unbeatable. These tentacles are also immune to damage, and even if they don't grab anything, they can limit movement, not to mention blunt damage. It's almost perfect."

"Sometimes, two groups of people fight each other, and you cast a fireball spell, but the opponent might just dodge it all, or directly absorb the damage. But this spell, it's a real-time grab and control of the enemy, even the strongest mages are afraid to be caught."

"The commander, are we waiting for them to be eliminated?" Zheng Xin allowed a nod, silently noting down this strategy.

"It's almost time, I'm planning to wrap up soon. Let's go on an adventure together, sneaking into the camp to see what kind of deity these demons worship, and how they managed to cultivate such a fierce demon army."

Zhou Xu said, his mouth not even paying attention to the deity being worshiped.

He's given these cavalry teams enough time to level up, now it's time for him to finish his tasks.

"What commander, do you plan to dispose of these monsters?" he asked.

A moment later, Xin allowed his eyes to narrow with excitement, saying, "As I said, we should first eliminate each of these flying 'two-legged dragons' one by one, and see how they scatter."

However, Zhou Xu just shook his head.

"Do you know how true mages clear the scene?" he asked.

"Yes?" Xin's eyes lit up with great interest.

"It's all over, once and for all."

Zhou Xu lightly waved his hand downward, as if giving a signal to start the game.

Suddenly, fragments seemed to fall from the sleeves of Zhou Xu's robe, as if he was giving a signal to start the game.

In an instant, these semi-transparent magical energy fragments flew to the designated area and exploded, as if all the windows of a building had shattered at the same time.
Here is the translation of the text:

These deadly energy fragments suddenly form a burst of tornado-like explosive force, sweeping across the entire magical area!

Even more exaggerated is that this explosion occurs simultaneously in ten locations!

It's as if ten mages had just cast their spells together!

In an instant, the entire battlefield's horde of devouring demons suddenly appears with countless lacerations all over their bodies, as if they had really gone through a fragmentation explosion.

Just as these devouring demons were on the brink of death, the entire battlefield suddenly erupts with ten "fragment storms" in a chain reaction.

This continues to happen.

Even mighty dragons and wild warriors among the devouring demons gradually become corpses as they are torn apart by the fragmentation explosion.

In the end, the battlefield is covered with a dense layer of corpses of devouring demons.

"How was this done?" many mages who know the limitations of magic ask, incredulous.

"How can there be ten simultaneous spells?"

Zhao Xu just smiled slightly.

"Fragment Storm is a five-ring molding spell, a continuous damage spell that affects a 3D6 area each time. However, under my twin sibling's extreme effect, the damage is increased to 36 points, enough to knock a devouring demon half-dead."

"But how did you achieve the simultaneous release of ten times?" the mages asked urgently.

"I also simulated a super-magic specialty - Delayed Spell, which can make spells take effect 1-5 rounds later. Therefore, I consecutively cast the Fragment Storm ten times, making them all detonate at the same moment."

"One round can cast one mark and one instantaneous spell, and there are two in total. After five rounds, there are ten in total."

"So, that's why you see ten five-ring spells 'Fragment Storm' occurring simultaneously on the battlefield."
