Chapter 655: Cursed Items, Portal to Another World

The name Diemo Highgin may be unfamiliar to many, but the fact that he is the leader of the 88-layer saltwater swamp beneath the earth is shocking enough to make one's hair stand on end.

A normal demon can cause a normal person to lose everything and become homeless, let alone one who claims to be the leader of the demons.

This demon's sudden appearance has ignited the deepest fears of everyone present.

However, Zhao Xu remained unfazed, and from the depths of his body, he unleashed a brilliant "silver flame"!

As the "silver flame" illuminated the dark blue light, the six-armed snake demon let out a pained cry.

"Lord of the Summer!"

"I'm just making contact with you through this method, not trying to offend you!"

"If you have any dissatisfaction, I can apologize and atone for my mistake afterwards. Please give me a chance to explain the promises and agreements made by my lord!"

However, Zhao Xu simply smiled coldly and shook his head.

At this moment, he finally realized that no matter what method, whether it's "expulsion magic" or "counter-curse," it is all a means to "exorcise" demons.

But only the "silver flame" originating from the goddess, the most fundamental source, is the most absolute guarantee of exorcism.

Before anyone could blink, Zhao Xu drove the "silver flame" surrounding himself to engulf the entire area within the force field.

The force field was equivalent to the strongest defense spell below the fourth ring.

However, it was also one of the most decisive restrictive spells!

At this moment, the six-armed snake demon's ethereal body, which could normally pass through the main material plane and the spiritual realm at will, was severely restricted.
At this moment, it finally realized that this thin layer of "force field" was indeed an insurmountable barrier.

"Ah!"

The people outside the barrier could only hear this mournful cry.

Tearing one's heart and lungs apart, a pitiful wail.

The silver flames' radiance reflected on each person's face, mirroring their different mental states.

Or, this was also the first time for them to see Zhao Xu, who had been silent for so long, display his true strength.

It is said that two nations will not attack each other unless it is absolutely necessary, and this is not purely a matter of morality, but rather means that if the messenger is killed, it means giving up the last channel of communication, resulting in a dead-end outcome.

Therefore, two powers of similar scale will not recklessly abandon the possibility of potential communication.

However, no one expected Zhao Xu to cut off the connection so abruptly.

Even the last words of the six-armed snake demon, "World Dominator," were still echoing in everyone's ears.

Finally, as the barrier's confining force dissipated.

The silver flames' warm energy also dissipated, slowly recondensing back into Zhao Xu's body.

At this moment, Zhao Xu said with a hint of coldness, "Let's talk business. Let Diemo GÃ¶gen come personally."

He then looked at the people who were shocked and trembling with fear, "The little warm one has undergone my silver flames purification and will no longer be affected. She will recover after a rest."

"Mom, let's find a room for her to rest and have the church pastor visit her every day to help her recover," he said with a nod.

Zhao's mother suddenly nodded in understanding.
Zhao Xu looked directly at Xiao Nuan's mother, Liu Aunt, and said, "Well, you have also crossed over, so you shouldn't have any commemorative items. Let's sort through all your belongings and see what we can find. My mom can help you supplement your recent living essentials."

After saying this, Zhao Xu quickly left.

Throughout the process, he seemed like a passing stranger.

However, everyone knew that this topic was closely related to what happened today.

...

Zhao Xu had agreed to meet Ai Nuo Ya at the Moon Above the Lychee Tree at midnight and then held a half-day meeting. After that, he had no other appointments.

He quietly stood in the room, lost in thought, signing off on some reports that had been pending for a while.

As people know, those who climb to great heights can see more smiling faces, but those who stay at the bottom can only see a red bottom.

Zhao Xu also realized what it means to have the power to make judgments and bear responsibility. As the highest authority, he even had the power to manipulate the "people's power" and the "authority of the people". However, he could only retreat three feet.

The rules of the Goddess Church state that the electors have significant power over the red-robed bishops of large dioceses.

At this moment, he didn't care what he said, as long as he could clap and cheer loudly.

Even if someone wanted to point out some imperfections, he would first need to set up a pile of evidence, and then point out some minor flaws that could be corrected. Finally, he would need to add a sentence of praise, saying that "the imperfections are not as important as the overall achievement".

Even the most ordinary person would think they are all-powerful if they occupy this position for a long time.

Zhao Xu thought about this and shook his head calmly, trying to clear his mind and return to the "difficult situation" at hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, he was standing on a soft, plush carpet, facing a tablecloth made of woven fabric that was several meters long. The table was placed with various household items that he had brought back from Liu's place.

It's undeniable that Zhao's mom was still quite considerate towards Zheng's aunt's family. She had provided them with essentials like winter coats, lamps, water bottles, and soap.

At present, the production level of Yaoming's factory was still struggling to produce, and the quantity was limited. Even if he wanted to buy something, there was no place to buy it.

Most of the items had been allocated to the most critical departments, and it was without a doubt that Zhao's mom had allocated her share.

At this moment, each item on the table had been labeled by people asking questions and making clear the source of each item.

Soon, Zhao walked to another table, where items were placed that were not gifts from his mom. They were actually obtained through trading with Zheng's aunt's family and others. The items were mostly obtained through game items.

A few weeks ago, all non-players, except for players, were basically naked, with only their clothes on. If not for Zhao's waste of the "Divine Power", people wouldn't have been able to even wear clothes to change and wear.

This was also the reason why countless people were grateful to Zhao.

But unexpectedly, Zheng's aunt's family had already had a surplus of goods to trade with. Zhao just smiled at this, and it was no wonder that everyone wanted to climb up. It was really a case of one person getting rich while others struggled.

After the priest of the temple inspected these items, the inspection should have been completed. However, Zhao couldn't help but think that the other party had secretly entered their home's headquarters. If not for the fact that he had caught a big fish, he would have been close enough to Zhao's parents, who were just a few meters away. Therefore, Zhao decided to personally inspect these items and try to find any clues.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entity attached to the body is not limited to possessing a human being. It can also possess an object. During the process of a person touching an object, the transfer takes place. Therefore, this "possession" effect is completely unstoppable.

Only then did the six-armed serpent demon, which Zhao Xu had introduced himself, reveal its true form. Although its name couldn't be spoken out loud, the serpent demon's true rank in the abyss was not low. It was a large-scale, otherworldly being with a body that looked like a beautiful human woman with six arms. At least up to the waist, this was true. As for the lower body, it was a spiral, scaly body with green scales, confirming its name as a "serpent demon".

As a 17th-level existence, the serpent demon had the identity of a general and a strategist, with wisdom and strategy comparable to that of the Great Devil Emperor Di Mo Gao Ren. Zhao Xu didn't even let the opponent say a single word before killing him, partly out of fear of Di Mo Gao Ren's arrival, who was relying on the serpent demon's power. Partly, he was worried that the opponent would say more seductive words, confusing the people listening nearby.

At this moment, Zhao Xu began to pick up some small, personal belongings. He wouldn't bother checking the close-fitting clothes, but rather looked at things like "goat hide paper" and "wooden box". These kinds of things often had the mark of evil, making it convenient for the two to possess each other.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on a painting. He finally remembered that Little Rou had changed majors to art in high school and then went on to art school. But he didn't expect the opponent to have actually crossed over and replaced the painting with one from King Arthur's time. Was this a technique for exchanging paintings between worlds?
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu held his doubts, lifted the oil painting in front of him, and looked at the female angel in the center of the painting, which was actually the highest-ranking angel in the heavenly hierarchy, "Fiendish God".

The painting depicted the angel's golden armbands on both arms and hands, with intricate details on the bow and arrow on her back. The painting was so realistic that it seemed to come alive.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's heartstrings were pulled.

Although the temptation was weak, he still couldn't help but look at the subtle "magical glow" hidden in the painting.

Zhao Xu immediately focused his attention, using his concentrated power, and his "secretive vision" began to unravel the painting before his eyes.

Then, Zhao Xu removed the sticky note on the painting:

"This painting was done a week ago and was exchanged with a wandering player. The other party lacked food and used this painting to exchange 10 pounds of meat with Zheng Nuan."

10 pounds of meat?

Zhao Xu immediately reacted to this information.

At this time, the player who was not carrying much food was also unable to find a channel to buy food. Therefore, most people relied on external supplies.

It was not unusual for players to exchange their own items and those with channels for food.

However, Yang'er did not have the industrialized level of the earth, and meat products were naturally cheap. Most people mainly lived on coarse grains.

In the Northern Alliance, one pound of meat cost 6 silver coins, and 10 pounds of meat could cost 6 gold coins.

This was not a painting by a famous artist, and 6 gold coins were enough to buy it.

Not to mention the "resource-strapped" Yang'er at this time.

Zheng Aixia's indulgence towards her daughter had reached this level?

Even if Zhao Xu's mom was extravagant, 20 pounds would definitely be a future quantity.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoxu suddenly unfolded the second note stuck to the paper, and it became clear to him.

Zheng auntie was willing to spend money to buy this pair of words, naturally, it would spread "magical light".

The player who carried the painting would also bring a piece of paper, because the painting possessed "magical light", although it was unclear what kind of magical item it was.

However, magical items like this painting can be said to be extraordinary, with prices ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of gold coins.

At this time, Zhaoxu silently opened the third note stuck to the painting roll, just as he had suspected.

It was like the snake catching the cricket, and Huang Ju was hiding in the back.

At that time, Zheng auntie wanted to take advantage of the fire to steal, and make a profit.

After all, temporary warmth is only temporary, so she was willing to take advantage of the high price of food to exchange for a pair of paintings that spread magical light.

Unfortunately, the painter who traded with them was not an easy-to-deal-with guy.

Zheng auntie and her family could use a week's time to rely on Zha's relationship to figure out the details of the painting.

Naturally, the player who carried the painting also had time to figure out the truth of the painting, and then took the opportunity to give it up.

One wants to hit, and one wants to block; both parties completed the transaction and said a fool's words, and it was impossible to blame anyone.

At this time, Zhaoxu looked at the painting that began to emit even stronger magical light, and couldn't help but laugh out loud.

This painting was just an ordinary painting that emitted magical light, not a magical item at all.

If you rely on "magic detection" to detect it, then there would be no legend of wizards buying fake magical items or detecting them.

The process of making magical items is inherently complex and precise, making it easy for mistakes to occur, so some "magical items" with defects are also intended.
Sometimes, it takes years of use to discover the true nature of an object. Even items that seem perfect when they leave the factory can undergo significant changes over time due to exposure to magical forces, dimensional portals, mysterious creatures, or effects. These items are often referred to as cursed objects, regardless of whether they were intentionally created to harm people or not.

Cursed objects can take many forms, including enchanted crystals, wands, and other magical items. For example, there is a legendary "Heart Crystal Ball" that appears to be a normal crystal ball at first glance. However, once used, it can induce a hypnotic effect, making the user see what they want to see. In reality, the crystal ball is controlled by a powerful mage, wizard, or extraterrestrial being, ultimately leading to the user's enslavement.

There are also enchanted brooms that appear to be ordinary brooms at first glance. However, once used, they can attack the user with a series of swift blows.

Zhao Xu has seen these cursed objects on the black market, including a "Flying Broom" that costs 5,200 gold coins. He wonders who would buy such an item.

Cursed objects can be categorized into six types: counterfeits, reverse effects, defects, additional requirements, side effects, and aberrations. The oil painting in front of him is an example of a counterfeit object. Although it has no magical powers, it can make people believe it's a magical item, and it may even trigger some magical effects when held.

Only the "Remove Curse" spell can reveal the true nature of a cursed object.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not hard to imagine the expression of joy and excitement on the face of the wanderer who received the painting, but unfortunately, he can only exchange it for six pounds of meat in the end.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to put down the painting.

Suddenly, the heavenly god on the oil painting opened its originally closed eyes, and began to wave its arms like a spell.

The next moment, a brilliant light burst forth from behind the angel in the painting, like a concentrated electric light - a "light gate" that shone like a portal to another world.

A hidden "interdimensional passage" within the painting!
