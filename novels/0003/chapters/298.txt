Chapter 299: The Deathly Pointing Finger

The goblin troops that have just arrived, with their gray-yellow exoskeletons, appear to be from the same tribe. These goblins, who have already formed a large squad, are paired with a career-level officer and accompanied by a goblin leader of level six or seven, who is stationed at the front of the squad. Behind them, there are about twenty pack wolves, including some ferocious ones. This force would be a formidable opponent for the Watchers' Guild to face in battle.

Most adventurer teams that have ventured outside the city have had encounters with goblin raiding parties. The weapons in most warriors' hands are those they've seen blood for the first time in battle against goblins.

Goblins have massive populations with extremely high birth rates, so even if they suffer heavy losses, their numbers can quickly recover and continue to attack travelers along the way.

However, when Zhao Xu simultaneously released two "fireball" spells, the goblin squad leader had already sounded the alarm and led the large team in evasive maneuvers.

However, the goblins' massive forward momentum made it impossible to dodge the rapidly approaching fireballs at first glance, making it seem like the goblins were determined to die.

By the time Zhao Xu cast the fireballs, they had already determined their landing points.

As a fireball spell with long-range capabilities, Zhao Xu's fireballs can directly hit enemies two hundred meters away, exceeding the range of a single-shot rocket launcher.
As the two fireballs landed on the ground, they stirred up a cloud of dust, and it was as if a grenade had exploded, suddenly filling the air with a massive firestorm. The sound of thunderous explosions echoed through the air, and the fireballs sprayed out in all directions.

Countless goblins, still bewildered, were directly engulfed by the flames, which wrapped around their entire bodies like a shroud, as if they were trapped in a sea of fire and unable to struggle free.

For a moment, the entire battlefield was filled with the piteous cries of the goblins, their cries of anguish piercing the air.

The basic damage of the fireball spell is 1-6 points of damage (1D6), but since Zhao Xiu's spellcaster level has reached level 7, all goblins caught in the flames suffered a total of 7 layers of damage, ranging from 7 to 42 points (7D6).

With a base life of 5 HP, the ordinary goblins were instantly incinerated by the high-temperature burns caused by the fireball.

As the flames from the fireball spell gradually dissipated, the once-mighty goblin army, which had been charging forward with valor, lay strewn across the battlefield, their bodies charred black.

Alas, the fireball spell was only a brief flash of flames, and otherwise, the sight would have been a sea of charred goblin corpses, making it impossible even for the ordinary "Revive the Dead" skill to save them.

However, in the eyes of the Watchers' Guild, this was the first time they had witnessed a complete fireball spell covering most of the enemy forces, causing actual casualties.

Anyone who saw more than a hundred goblin warriors, struggling to the death, being wiped out by two fireballs, would feel uneasy.

"It's brutal fireball magic, after all."

"It's the brutal mage, not to mention that even if there are still surviving goblins, they wouldn't dare move at this point and would pretend to be dead, lying on the ground."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"How is it that the goblin leader also died? Is the damage limit of the fireball spell so high?" an observant wanderer asked after noticing this point.

He had heard of the fame of the "fireball" spell, and he also knew that this spell could be reflected to dodge half of the damage. Even wanderers with the profession of rogue could obtain the ability "reflexive evasion" after completing the 2nd level training, which allowed them to completely avoid the damage of this spell.

According to his guess, even if the goblin leader did not successfully evade, it would not directly collapse to the ground. The goblin leader at the front of the goblin team was wearing a half-plate armor that had been looted, and holding a large sword in his hand. His combat power was not inferior to that of a human 5th-level warrior, but he had become a corpse lying on the ground, exposed to the wind and rain.

The goblin tribe, which had taken half a lifetime to develop, was also reduced to ashes by the two fireballs. Even if the leader was alive, he would be unable to accept this scene.

At this time, Chen Nuo explained to the surrounding companions, "The goblin leader was simultaneously covered by two fireballs."

The range of the fireball spell was a circular area with a radius of 6 meters, which was wider than a soccer goal. When two circular areas overlapped, there would naturally be a residual area. It was easy to cover the goblins with fireballs, but it was not easy to cover a specific person with overlapping areas. The larger the overlapping area, the narrower the range of coverage on the sides.

This also showed the combat experience of the crazy wind mage. At this time, including Frost sword in the higher-level group, everyone was lost in thought.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the three giant demons saw this scene, the primal fear of fire that originated from their instincts made them hesitate for a few moments. However, this hesitation was soon replaced by their own desires, and they continued to hold up their weapons and charge towards the waiting players.

"Kechi, lead your team of four to eliminate the surviving goblins who learned the fireball spell," Guild Master Frost Sword shouted his orders.

He immediately dispatched the players who were weak against giant demons to investigate the fallen goblins and confirm that they had indeed all died, so as to avoid being ambushed by the goblin marksmen from the rear during the battle with the giant demons.

As the warriors who were continuing the formation charged forward, holding up their tower shields to face the giant demons' attacks.

After two months of training, the players had realized that everyone's time was equal. The giant demons could only attack one or two players each round.

Without magical attacks, the players could even stand in line and let the giant demons kill them, but it would take at least 10 rounds.

The leading giant hunter saw this scene and immediately understood the players' plan, but didn't care and directly swung his war axe at the nearest player.

However, at close range, the arrows fired by the guard in the guild, which were half-empty, were mostly shot wide, and even those that hit were blocked by the giant demons' formidable defense.

The three giant demons, all wearing "Chain Armor", had a natural defense of 5 levels, and the armor itself provided an additional 5 levels of defense. When combined, the total defense exceeded 20 levels, directly imposing a significant psychological pressure on the players present.
Here is the translation:

While relying on the limited ring magic of the caster, even if damage is caused, it is directly recovered by the giant's 5HP regeneration ability. In the first round of combat against the giant, even the high-ranking officials of the guild, including the Frost Sword, realized this point, but they were at a loss for a while.

The Frost Sword could only cry out to the "Barbarian" player to take the lead as the main output force.

As for the Barbarian, as long as they have high strength and vitality at the start, combined with the "Frenzy" ability, they can guarantee a certain minimum output.

However, Zhao Xu did not release the fire-infused weapon to the Barbarian player, so even if they successfully pierce the defense, they can only deal non-fatal damage to the giant.

Players can wear armor, and the same monsters can wear armor too.

So, sometimes the same tactics, such as the "Control" spell, are unusable by players against monsters due to various immunities, while monsters with spellcast abilities can use them effectively against players.

At this time, Zhao Xu was watching the battle unfold and assessing the strength of the "Sentinel" guild itself.

The giants could knock down players every time they attacked, seemingly limited by weapon damage and the opponent not using full force. On the sidelines, the Cleric could use the "Healing Light" spell to recover fallen players, lifting their life lines from below 0HP to above 0HP.

This is the advantage of a 40-person guild team, where Clerics can continue to cast healing spells until their mana is depleted, as long as the giant does not unleash a critical hit. If Zhao Xu's team was a four-person squad, they would need only two rounds to wipe out the entire team, forcing them to wait for revival.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The frost sword, which has been observing the battle from the sidelines, preparing to replace anyone who falls, has already realized that the situation is out of control.

In the team, there are only two limited healers who must venture out to the fallen players, using healing spells that require physical contact. He knows that prolonging the battle will only make things worse for them.

Even if a player is revived by a healer, they are only barely pulled back from the brink of death, and it's not enough to guarantee their survival. If they don't receive full recovery, they will inevitably die in the next battle.

The number of Arthur's spellcasters is already limited, with only 40 people in the team, including three healers. It's already a luxury to revive fallen players, let alone restore them to full health.

As a result, the barbarian and ranger from the "Guardian" guild begin to take the initiative to restrain the giant demons.

Originally, players could defeat high-level monsters by relying on their own attacks, showcasing their skills and earning high praise, with a score of around 20. However, facing giant demons that can regenerate and recover their lives, this blood-letting strategy has lost its effectiveness.

"Wind Mage, do you have any second-tier spells left?" The frost sword, who has also been knocked back, asks Zhao Xu, who is standing beside him, although he finds it strange that the Wind Mage is not nervous at all.

In his heart, he knows that Zhao Xu has used two three-tier "Fireball" spells and is no longer possible to continue preparing fireball spells, let alone three-tier spells. He can only rely on the Mage having some kind of miraculous second-tier spell to lend a hand.
At this time, Zhao Xu also roughly estimated the strength of the Guardian Association and directly said, "Okay."

Just as Shang Jian thought that this crazy wind mage was about to cast some spell to weaken those three giant demons, he saw him pick up the staff that was originally attached to his waist, which was a long, thin staff made entirely of finger bones, with a tiny skull with a very strange expression at the top.

Zhao Xu held the "Legendary Death Soul Staff" in his hand, pointed at the giant demon hunter in front of him, and drove the seven-ring spell contained in the staff, whispering softly, "One finger of death."
