Chapter 336: The Million-Gold Coin

Suddenly, within the sacred and majestic cathedral, Zhao Xu's staff emitted a brilliant light representing the intent of death and destruction. Unlike the "Profaning God's Tongue" spell, which was part of the sound wave magic system, this "Death's Finger" spell could only be cast at close range and had a limited attack distance, but it could target only one enemy.

Furthermore, each time it was used, it was accompanied by the will of death, and it drew upon the most primal power of death from the heavens and the earth. Everyone present could feel the faint tremble of fear as they sensed the approaching death. Even the mighty Rean, a law wizard nearing legendary level, was unable to shatter the spell's resistance with his 20th-level magic.

Part of the reason was that the law wizard himself had increased his magical resistance, and another part was that he could summon the power of the abyss to defend against it. However, could a low-level mage still cast an effective spell against it?

However, the legendary staff of death wielded by Zhao Xu was worth a million gold coins because the "Death's Finger" spell itself had been upgraded to a whopping 16th circle, significantly increasing the difficulty of the spell's avoidance. Any opponent with a strength of 14 levels or above would essentially be guaranteed to die. With this staff, Zhao Xu's magical proficiency was equivalent to 27 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, he unleashed his inner potential, adding 1-6 points of bonus to all his performance tests for 1-20 levels. Instantly, he released this spell, equivalent to a 30th-level caster, with a 50% increase over a 20th-level Liena. The "Death Finger" spell's power was instantaneous, piercing through the "Mimi" creature's spell resistance without hesitation. Following this, a wave of death energy seeped into its body, from the exterior scales to the internal bones.

In a flash, the once-overwhelming "Mimi" creature had turned into countless bubbles, dispersing and seemingly never having existed in this world. When this happened, Matthew flew back, staring at the spot where the "Mimi" had just vanished.

He touched the bubbles, but couldn't detect the slightest hint of stench. It wasn't that he moved slowly; he had actually put in his all to rush back. The exchange between Zhao Xu and the "Mimi" had occurred in an instant.

Many novice priests barely blinked, and the battle was over. "Dead?" The old priest, with a slightly dry throat, asked humbly, as if not daring to believe it. The novice priests saw the old priest's humble tone and immediately understood that the man who had just killed the monster was probably the legendary strongman revered by players on the forum.

Meanwhile, Priest Blanch remained silent, lost in thought, gazing at the fading bubble shadow. "There was no death," Zhao Xu shook his head, "The opponent must have been an illusion."
Here is the translation:

"How is that possible?" Matthew asked, his attack feedback feeling completely real just moments ago.

Moreover, the opponent's "abomination words" had left him completely stunned.

"There's no residue," Zhao Xu simply described.

At that moment, a sudden cloud of dust swept in, and it was none other than Rayan, who was still flying in mid-air, with beads of sweat on his forehead.

Behind him, three sorcerers, each dressed in different attire, arrived, and the four of them gazed at the hall in wonder, carefully scanning their surroundings with their "true knowledge" abilities.

The demon, relying on its abyssal divine power, could evade detection by "true knowledge". However, it didn't mean it could hide its true form.

"Resolved?" Rayan asked, looking puzzled?

The two high-ranking wizards and priests behind him remained silent, watching Rayan with expectant expressions.

Matthew then recounted the events that had just transpired to Rayan in detail.

At this point, the novice priests who had been watching the scene unfold couldn't help but burst into a chorus of excited chatter.

They finally realized that something shocking had happened, and they had been brought back from the brink of death.

Rayan, having listened, began to recount his recent experience, "The demon was carrying a divine artifact, and the opponent's divine artifact allowed it to perform duplication and transmission."

"Haven't the Sacred Heart Cathedral prohibited long-range transmission, and even internal transmission is limited to a 9-meter range?" Zhao Xu quickly picked up on the loophole in Rayan's description.

The one who set up this lock was the former goddess of magic, Sylvina.
Even if the demon was carrying an artifact, Zhao Xu was not too sure if the opponent could really break through the restrictions set by Sylvia herself.

At this point, Le An's face turned red as he explained apologetically: "It was a mistake, actually a reverse summoning principle. It's equivalent to summoning oneself in a duplicate body, so it just happened to pass through the loophole. After all, they have come to the main material plane, and they themselves are in a special state."

Then Le An continued to say, "We just chased after them, and the demon was creating duplicates of itself, each fleeing on its own. This scenario played out repeatedly. However, the illusion created by the demon could be seen through by using the True Knowledge technique."

Although True Knowledge is only a 5th-level spell, Brandy can also use it. However, it is a minute-level spell, so unless there is enough magical energy or a spellcasting duration, high-level spellcasters will not use it in combat.

Therefore, in the instant that the demon created duplicates of itself, Le An could only see through it with the "True Knowledge" technique, so the whole process was actually carried out by him alone.

As long as he kept a close eye on the demon, no matter how many duplicates it created, it couldn't escape him.

It was unexpected that even after the demon created multiple duplicates, it could still transmit itself to another duplicate to replace it, ultimately evading his pursuit.

"So, starting from when you attacked the opponent, the demon had already switched back to its original body in this classroom. Then, just as Zhong Xia was about to kill the opponent, the demon was severely injured and directly switched to another duplicate." Le An thought through the whole process in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This demon is also cunning, it started by hiding among these novice players, relying on the fact that the players didn't know each other's past and had no familiar features to hide. It's unclear if the opponent is still hiding among these players now."

The words of Lei'an suddenly made the novice players in the audience all look at each other with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. "Don't mess with them," Zhao Xu said with a scowl.

His words were loud and reassuring, and the players in the audience felt a sense of relief, realizing that Lei'an was just joking with them. If that demon had actually disguised itself as one of them and was hiding, it would have been terrifying.

"This young apprentice looks like he's really got it together, he almost killed that demon priest, and then suddenly realized that the opponent hadn't actually died," Elderly Priest Blanch said to Lei'an, praising Zhao Xu's bravery.

Zhao Xu's quick thinking had just saved everyone in the room. Otherwise, by the time Lei'an returned, there might not have been a single person left alive in the classroom.

This also made Elderly Priest Blanch grateful that she had released "anti-death protection" magic on Zhao Xu beforehand.

"What's with this kid being able to hold the position of 'High-level Supervisor' at such a young age?" Lei'an said, looking at Zhao Xu with a mixture of surprise and admiration.

"Ah, I heard about a case where a deep prison demon was killed in battle?" Elderly Priest Blanch said, looking at Zhou Xia with a mixture of surprise and awe. The deep prison demon was an existence that even she couldn't match.

However, Zhao Xu didn't dare tell the other party that the "deep prison demon" that had been projected was in a blank state, unlike the demon that had appeared today with levels of around ten or so.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's with the deep prison refining demons?" A female pastor whispered, who had just entered the game and didn't quite understand the conversation between the high-ranking players in front of her. However, she knew that today's experience would definitely be recorded in the forum with great significance, so she listened carefully from start to finish, almost taking notes on the dialogue.

"A demon similar to Baal, the deep prison refining demon is a top-tier existence among ordinary demons in the underworld, and it's close to legendary power," a male player beside her answered.

"This isn't true, right? Every NPC's biography can be accurately traced back, and the pastor's face is just 20 years old. This is slaughtering the powerful demons in hell," someone said.

"Don't envy, work hard, and one day we'll be able to stand there and chat with the big guys," another player said.

At this moment, Ray didn't have any objections to the pastor's whispering, and he directly walked up to Zhao Xu's face, staring at the "Legendary Soul Wand" that Zhao Xu had just used to let the demon escape.

"This is the magic resistance of the demon that the wand just defeated?" Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

Suddenly, Ray's eyes widened in shock, and he exclaimed, "This is too unfair! I went on adventures and didn't touch a wand worth hundreds of thousands of gold coins!"

This sentence made the two people behind him, who had followed him, stare at Zhao Xu's wand.

Among the players, some heard the price and took a deep breath.

"What's the exchange rate for 100 gold coins?" another player asked.

"I'm not sure, but I might have some idea," another player said, feeling a bit numb about the number.
When did Arthur's magical items use millions as a unit of measurement, boasting about it?
