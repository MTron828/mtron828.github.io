Chapter 585: Trembling Exhale, Malicious Transformation

At this moment, Zhao Xu gazed at the giant dragon flapping its wings in front of him, his heart unshaken, with no hint of fear or intimidation. He had lost the blessing of the "Ten Thousand Laws Book" after arriving at the peak where the memories of the ancient being, Ansil, resided. However, after conducting an initial check-up, he confirmed that all his professional skills and magical abilities were still intact. He was still quite capable of fighting.

Zhao Xu then sprang up onto his toes and jumped lightly into the air, instantly utilizing the air pressure around him to lift himself up. He hovered in mid-air, momentarily flying over the head of a small girl.

"Hooo!"

Facing the red dragon, which had also taken to the skies, Zhao Xu let out a fierce cry, as if the sound of a speeding car, accompanied by a fierce and intimidating aura.

However, Zhao Xu showed no signs of weakness, despite his disheveled hair and hat falling off his head. His inner resolve remained unbroken.

He hovered above the burning town in the distance, calmly uttering a spell:

"Magical Extreme Effect: Dragon's Exhale!"

This spell allowed for a prolonged magical effect, but Zhao Xu had not taken the time to prepare it in advance, so he directly obtained the ability to spit out a weapon.

Meanwhile, his "Supreme Magic Wand" was also switched out by the storage pouch on his palm.

As for the people below, the Zhao Xu who had just created a miracle by flying into the air was now holding a stick no taller than a child's height, which looked far from being a weapon capable of challenging a giant dragon.
Here is the translation:

However, Zhao Xu's attention had already been fixed on his dynamic bar.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you use the Quaternary Arcane "Dragon's Breath" with the feature of Black Dragon, dealing 10-meter straight-line damage of 80 HP (10D8 critical hit) lasting for 32 turns.】

The red dragon in front of him, at least of the ancient dragon level, had already reached a damage level of 20-200 HP, and Zhao Xu's "Dragon's Breath" even with an extreme effect, was still slightly inferior to the opponent's 110 HP.

So he needed to strengthen it further.

The super magical staff suddenly emitted a bright blue magical glow on the tip of the metal iron ball——"Trembling Breath"!

A special five-ring spell designed to enhance the "breathing" weapon.

As the arcane power flooded in, Zhao Xu's original ability to produce acidic saliva was suddenly replaced by another mysterious energy that enveloped him.

During the time when Zhao Xu was completely focused on casting the spell, his natural combat instinct made him very confident, never stopping to evaluate the opponent's red dragon, which had spread its massive dragon body to charge towards Zhao Xu, clearly intending to get closer and breathe out a deathly fiery breath!

However, after resting for a while, Zhao Xu had recovered his magical combat strength by the next turn and moved even faster!

"Higher Arbitrary Port"!

Another five-ring spell was thrown out mercilessly, meaning that Zhao Xu could trigger the "Arbitrary Port" ability at any time within the next 16 turns (every 2 levels 1 turn), allowing him to teleport anywhere within a 500-meter radius at will!

He could easily complete a 400-meter dash.
Here is the translation of the text:

On this side, Zhao Xu had the same thought and suddenly disappeared from everyone's sight. At the same time, those who had barely managed to grab a plank and were floating on the river, trying to escape, all stared blankly at the strange phenomenon in the sky. This included the little girl who had just started looking for her parents.

However, another loud cry suddenly caught everyone's attention!

Zhao Xu had precisely calculated the spatial distance and used his teleportation ability to land behind the red dragon, which was rushing towards them. He turned around, facing the dragon's tail, preparing to launch an attack.

The evil red dragon, who was not stupid, looked at the crowd below with a startled expression and suddenly understood the situation.

However, it didn't try to waste time turning around, and instead swung its tail with incredible speed, drawing a huge arc!

The dragon's six styles of combat - biting, clawing, wing attack, tail attack, crushing, and tail sweep!

The last style, the tail sweep, immediately released an extremely powerful force, bringing with it a terrifying aura of around 40 points of power.

If ordinary people were hit, they would likely be smashed to pieces or even broken into four or five parts.

Zhao Xu, who was holding the "Quick Burst" technique in his hand, didn't rush forward. Instead, he puffed out his cheeks and blew out air, like a toad.

However, what came out of Zhao Xu's mouth was not a playful drool like a child!

A massive amount of acid mist burst out of Zhao Xu's mouth, accompanied by a continuous "psssst" sound. If it were poured onto a stone, it would likely produce a faint smoke.

But what was even more terrifying was that this acid liquid was mixed with a large amount of blue magical energy balls, which followed the 10-meter-long acid liquid stream and shot straight at the red dragon's back!

"It's too late!"
"Too bad!"
Here is the translation of the text:

As the people around them observed the celestial battle, they all had a haunting thought, and their primal instinct to survive and escape re-emerged. Even if the mysterious man in the sky could spit out a similar acidic liquid to attack his opponents, he himself was running out of luck, and most people couldn't imagine this kind of swift response.

This brief moment of time was only enough to let out a sigh of relief.

However!

When the blue light balls fell on the red dragon's body, the originally proud and powerful dragon suddenly revealed a stunned expression, its facial expression fixed in place.

As this gigantic red dragon lost all control of its movements, its massive body became stiff and rigid, its powerful wings unable to generate any lift, and it fell freely in mid-air!

The shock was palpable!

Zhao Xü injected the resonant energy field into the spitting device, capable of knocking out any living being hit by the energy blast, including the incredibly resilient giant dragon.

Everyone saw the incredibly cruel dragon being knocked down for the first time, and they all smiled joyfully.

However, the out-of-control red dragon was like a falling meteorite, its massive body plummeting towards the ground.

As the over-10-ton massive body crashed onto the ground, it could cause high-rise buildings to collapse, mountains to slide, city walls to crumble, and lake water to splash everywhere. The smoke and dust even shot up into the sky.

Zhao Xü was also unaware that the dragon, which had just been about to attack him, was still extremely cautious and continued to charge forward, so the momentum of the impact did not dissipate, and it fell towards the direction of the little girl.

Seeing this awkward scene, Zhao Xü's heart was not panicked, and he still managed to rescue the situation by pulling on the chain around his neck.
Here is the translation:

So he didn't rush to use any door to get to the ground first, rushing to appear in front of the little girl to shield her.

Zhao Xu then straightened up his own super magical instant staff, chanting the incantation again towards that evil red dragon in a low voice: "Malicious Transmutation!"

"Whoosh!"

"Ah!"

In the next instant, a sheep battered by Zhao Xu's magic let out a pained cry, looking at everything around it with a bewildered expression and its four sheep legs.

The first attempt at exemption failed, and the target would become a small animal with a life value of not more than 1 dice.

The second attempt at exemption failed, and the target would lose its special ability, supernatural ability, magical ability, and spellcasting ability, as well as its new body, new form, special ability, intelligence, perception, and charm attributes.

Only its profession and level (life dice) would be retained, along with the benefits brought by its attacks, exemptions, and life values.

As a result, this red dragon had turned into a sheep, retaining its powerful and ferocious strength while having an extremely high blood volume, but was still within the category of sheep.

"This little sheep, I give it to you."

Zhao Xu knelt down and patted the top of the little girl's head.

"It's been a long time, Miss May."
