Chapter 250: Exchanging Chips
Not the bottom of the lake, but the bottom of the earth?
The other party's statement made Zhao Xu's mouth slightly open, but he didn't continue to say anything.

As a top-level pastor, he naturally couldn't ask a series of questions like that.

Moreover, he had already figured out the sequence of events.

He suspected that it was the secret of the bottom of the Star Lake that caused the celestial bodies to fall from the sky, transforming the originally low-quality silver mine into a valuable silver mine worth millions of gold.

This ultimately led to the prosperity of Star Lake, with people flooding in.

"Looks like I'm talking to the right person?" Zhao Xu said.

He didn't lower his vigilance in his heart.

If he wasn't careful, he wouldn't be able to withstand the sudden changes.

However, as Frank, who was now a biological being of secret silver, had detached himself from the human body and retained some human nature, his gaze at Zhao Xu also became softer and no longer gave off a sense of sudden tension.

"Master, he should know your ins and outs," Lacis said to Zhao Xu at this time.

"Not that?" Zhao Xu thought to himself, "I just set up a stone wall just now."

"Master, think about it yourself," Lacis said. "You're not just setting up a simple stone wall, you're actually the last to arrive first!"

Zhao Xu's gaze changed several times.

He wasn't unaware, but a bit hazy.

When Lacis said this, he suddenly understood why the other party was being ambiguous.

No mistake, he had just used the "Stone Wall Technique" to swiftly release and block the opponent's attack.

He could also take a direct attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a swift and sudden move that outpaced Frank. Frank's nervousness wasn't the wall he had set up, but rather his ability to anticipate others' moves. Ordinary mages, even if they knew the opponent's opening move was "Martial Law", would still be no match. Once they cast their spell, the opponent would have already switched to another spell. If they delayed casting their spell, the opponent's "Martial Law" would have already taken effect before they could even react. Therefore, Zhao Xu's "Instinctive Wall" technique, which he executed on the spot, left the opponent stunned. What threat could possibly compare to someone who could use their spell, take a moment to think, and then respond even faster than the opponent's spell? Moreover, Zhao Xu's swift move had given him a few precious seconds of thinking time. Other mages might only be able to recognize the opponent's spell after it had already taken effect, leaving no room for a comeback.

As the car hurtling towards them, everyone knew they had to jump out of the way, but nobody had the reaction time to do so. "The secrets of magic usually require an equal exchange. What will you pay in return?" Frank, the mage, took a sip of the rich coffee, made from the coffee beans produced in the Luoyang Kingdom, and the fragrance of the coffee slowly spread. "What will you pay in return?" Zhao Xu asked when he heard the words of the "Emerald Star Master" or "Silver Star Master". With the secret silver mine being born from the earth, it was unlikely that they would lack funds. "What do you want me to pay?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As Frank the wizard spoke, his tone became softer, "Like you can instantly summon a stone wall technique?" This time, he was fully focused on Zhaos Xu's every move, waiting for a response.

Deep beneath the earth, only the two of them were present. However, their focus was never on the treasure trove of precious silver mines and jewels surrounding them.

"Lakshmi, you're being too greedy, and sly," Frank suddenly exclaimed, filled with indignation, "Dare to covet your master's magic?"

"Really?" Zhaos Xu asked curiously.

"No, just kidding," Frank replied.

"You know better," Zhaos Xu said with a hint of annoyance.

The "Emerald Star Master" before him had clearly lost 5 levels of magical ability and could still cast a 9-ring technique, which meant the opponent had at least reached the legendary level!

Although it was unclear whether the opponent had studied legendary magic, the legendary level could grant legendary feats, and the opponent's threat level had increased significantly.

Zhaos Xu, with only 20 levels of priest ability, had no corresponding specialization or profession ability. Lakshmi was unable to transform, and he dared not rush forward recklessly.

The opponent before him was even more dangerous than the giant demon.

"Secrets of magic usually require an equivalent exchange. What price are you willing to pay?" Zhaos Xu turned the opponent's words back to him.

In reality, he meant that the opponent's secrets were not worth so much and needed to be paid more.

Unfortunately, angels like Frank were not skilled in "deception" skills, and Zhaos Xu could only perform naturally.

Luckily, the wizard's own "reading between the lines" skills were not high-level either.

"Oh, tell me, what do I need to add?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Frank, as a nine-ring mage, didn't show any signs of anger when he heard Zhao Xu's words. Instead, he looked pleased and eager to conclude the deal.

"Master, do you have the 'Quick Explosion' spell with four rings or the 'High-Level Quick Explosion' spell with eight rings?" Lark asked.

"No," Zhao Xu replied.

He had already memorized all the spells with one to two rings.

The "Secondary Quick Explosion" spell is available, but the time gap is minimal, making it almost useless in battle. On the other hand, the "High-Level Quick Explosion" spell can slow down the enemy's action time by an additional 6 seconds, making it more effective in combat.

It's not like destroying the world, but it can still be effective in taking down a mid-level team.

Lark was puzzled by Zhao Xu's abilities. His style was indeed unconventional.

Even those who had synchronized with angels couldn't simulate the "Unbridled Hero's Spirit" using "Miracle Magic." This was because they had never experienced it before.

As a result, Lark was curious.

"I simulated most of the world's magic in the final scroll space. When I used 'Miracle Magic' or 'Prayer Magic,' I would recall the feeling of the time," Zhao Xu replied simply.

"Wow, Master, I..." Lark's voice trailed off, as if she had touched something incomprehensible.

However, she quickly switched to another topic. "Master, what should we do? We can't give him what he wants."

Zhao Xu just smiled and said, "I can't give it to him either. If I do, it would disrupt the balance of mage forces."
Here is the translation of the text:

"That master, you'd better be careful, oh, since the opponent has transformed into a constructed life form, it naturally has a fatal weakness. But just like an immortal being, it is immune to paralysis, intimidation, property damage, energy absorption, and instant death effects, and so on."

"It also means that the 'gigantic scythe' attack prepared by Zhao Xu is no longer effective."

Zhao Xu no longer pretends to be mysterious, his tone cold and detached as he looks at Frank, the ring wizard, saying, "You go first. If you don't want to say it, don't say it and look ridiculous. You're more familiar with the value of that spell than I am."

Frank at this moment also sensed Zhao Xu's intention to make a deal, even though he had already become a magical life form with centuries of experience. He was still filled with excitement.

Zhao Xu's answer meant that he was willing to give up that spell.

"I have a 'Silver Crystal' here," Frank said, pulling out a shimmering silver crystal from his dimensional bag.

"Luckily, I almost made a fortune," Lark said, unable to help herself.

"This should be familiar to you, sir. It's a treasure I found after searching for it in the stardust mine. As long as you put this crystal into any silver mine, it will automatically transform it into a secret silver mine. According to its size, you can produce tens of millions of gold coins."

"Even if the mineral composition is good and you have enough patience to extract it, you can easily produce hundreds of millions of gold coins."

Frank said this cautiously, still observing Zhao Xu's expression, afraid that the other party might not appreciate what he had brought out.

Zhao Xu was slightly stunned when he heard tens of millions of gold coins.

"Hmm, hmm, hmm," Zhao Xu shook his head directly afterwards.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, the time had already reached the next day, and Zhao Xu's spellcasting ability had also instantly refreshed.

He waved his hand directly and shouted, "I want 20,000 gold coins!"

Instantly, the will of the heavens and earth converged here, and Zhao Xu's wish began to influence the order of this world.

Suddenly, a dimensional portal opened above the "treasure vault," and crisp, new gold coins began to fall from the sky, accumulating into a pile.

20,000 gold coins, not a single one missing.

Then, Zhao Xu looked at Frank with a hint of disdain in his eyes.

The subtle implication was clear: "Do I look like I'm short of money?"

Seeing this scene, Frank almost felt his heart, which had been secretly silvered, racing.

No-cost spellcasting!

He couldn't imagine that the other party could display such a move.

Frank himself had also practiced the "wish spell" before.

He remembered the intense pain he felt when his life energy was drained from his body during the spellcasting.

The priest before him was actually just wasting his time to prove that he didn't lack money by casting the "wish spell".

Or perhaps, from the other party's perspective, it wasn't a waste.

It was just like casting a zero-ring magic trick.

Both to make him envious and to make him feel intimidated.

The original thought in his mind was crushed to the bottom.

Zhao Xu saw the other party's face change in expression.

He knew that the other party hadn't discovered that he was using the "wish spell" from the heavenly daily allowance, rather than the real "wish spell".

The underworld's deception, relying solely on words, couldn't deceive this group of high-ranking mages.

Only by using a move that they didn't know how to counter could one move them.
Zhao Xu also continued to probe, saying, "Can you bring out something of equal value to negotiate?"

"Ah!" Frank suddenly seemed to have made up his mind, biting his teeth and saying:
