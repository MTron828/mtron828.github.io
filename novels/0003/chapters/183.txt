Chapter 184: The Mysterious Watchtower

The next day, Zhao Xu relogged in and noticed that the entire landscape of the other side of the wilderness had changed dramatically, with many more guards patrolling the area, scrutinizing the situation.

Many priests and mages began to appear in Zhao Xu's line of sight, as if they were preparing for the invasion of the "Deep Furnace" in this moment of crisis.

By normal standards, a "Deep Furnace" would not be limited to this, but considering the hidden altar behind it, this situation had become even more profound.

The residents of Arthur faced this crisis with the appearance of demonic beings, and no matter how high the "Rose Cross" scale was raised, they would not be surprised.

In the depths of the abyss and hell, those creatures that could successfully migrate to the material plane of Arthur, facing the countless Arthurian souls, were ecstatic as if they were indulging in a divine delicacy.

Some demons could slaughter a batch of souls and leave, but still understood the importance of restraint.

Others aimed to expand their power directly by recruiting Arthurian native personnel, then sparking a war, and finally harvesting the souls from the war, which was also a common tactic used by demons.

Compared to random killing and chaos, the evil of order was more like a war strategist.

Therefore, every time the Holy Church of Goodness was prepared for these visitors from the depths of the abyss, they were always on high alert, ready for any situation.

In the past, the entire northern region was destroyed, leading to the final "Sealing War" outbreak, which was also caused by the appearance of a passage connecting the abyss and hell to the material plane of Arthur.
At the end of the war, both sides fought fiercely around that bottleneck, and the outcome was extremely brutal. Many villages were virtually wiped out, and males born in some years were almost extinct.

After Zhao Xu received his mission from Lei An, he immediately left with two women, leaving a group of new mages looking puzzled behind. "Why can they go ahead and execute the mission while we have to wait here?" Jiang Shan asked, standing up.

Although Lei An did not need to be responsible for arranging personnel, he was present on the scene and had to take charge. He had only come to give Zhao Xu instructions before leaving.

Lei An pulled out an evaluation sheet written by Zhao Xu from his pocket, with brief comments on the 18 members. He glanced at Jiang Shan's face, then matched the names on the paper, and asked, "Say it again?"

Jiang Shan thought the situation had taken a turn and quickly asked, "How can they go ahead and execute the search mission while we have to wait here? Isn't that unfair to them?"

Lei An had promised the team that as long as they could smoothly find the clues to the altar, they would receive magical items as rewards.

The mention of magical items shocked the new mages, who were already in high spirits. This was probably the most lucrative task they had heard of since entering the Arthur world.

As a result, the person in charge of assigning tasks naturally became the object of their inquiry.

"Because he's handsome," Lei An replied briefly. "And the two female mages are also very beautiful. I find them agreeable, so I arranged for them to go ahead and execute the mission."
Here is the translation of the text:

When he heard these words, Jiang Shan was about to swallow his tongue, and only after a great effort did he manage to calm down and regain his composure. Just as he was about to ask a question, he found that Lei An was smiling at him, and his heart suddenly closed his mouth shut.

On the other side, Zhao Xu was walking along the stream, and their goal was the watchtower ahead. After Zhao Xu used his knowledge and skills to make a thorough examination and read through the region's materials provided by Lei An, he roughly understood the situation.

This region was originally a military camp, and the watchtower was built based on this. However, later on, it was rumored that the military camp was haunted, and many soldiers who trained there fell seriously ill. The commander in charge of training new recruits ignored this and allowed the number of deserters to increase. Eventually, the commander died suddenly, and the soldiers fled, leaving the area abandoned. Only the watchtower remained, exposed to the wind and sun.

Zhao Xu led the way as the team leader, while Wang Qingwei and Eiswich followed behind, flipping through the documents. Eiswich was carefully studying the terrain map of the distant wilderness, and suddenly exclaimed, "The difference between the world is so great!"

"Captain, do you know the detailed information about the 'Deep Furnace Demon'?" Eiswich asked.

Zhao Xu, who was re-stringing his bow, was surprised by Eiswich's question and asked, "Isn't there a record on that paper?"

"That paper only contains simple data," Eiswich said. "I'm actually curious about its part-time job situation."

Indeed, an 18th-level Deep Furnace Demon and a 20th-level wizard who had also worked part-time were two completely different concepts.

"However, we would still be killed by it, and it would be meaningless even if it was stronger," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without mentioning anything else, the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" has a unique ability in its "Fear Spirit" that can intimidate many ordinary players and render them unable to move.

For example, Zhao Xu was so scared that he was trapped in a state of fear when he saw the Golden Dragon roaring in the sky.

Not to mention the opponent's various magical abilities, which could easily knock Zhao Xu back.

Even these demons have the ability to summon demons, and if they really show it off again, they would be beaten by the group.

The more demons on the battlefield, the more difficult the challenge becomes.

Even if it's just a small monster summoned by the demon, it's a huge challenge for this team.

So Zhao Xu didn't even think about how to deal with it, but he immediately found his target and went back to notify Rayan.

In his past life, he had seen the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" in action at the Seal of the Demon World and had witnessed how it cut down humans like cutting grass. It's not even on the same level.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, do you know the attack pattern of the 'Deep Prison Refining Demon'?" Wang Qingwei asked suddenly.

Zhao Xu was puzzled, wondering why they wouldn't fight.

However, he quickly explained: "Generally, the opponent will first use fear spirit to intimidate, then use crushing force spells, followed by fireball and meteorite explosions. After that, it's mostly harvesting time."

After hearing Zhao Xu's explanation, the two women nodded in agreement.

Zhao Xu also realized that the opponent was preparing for a potential encounter.

However, against these powerful extraterrestrial beings, their only option is to flee.

The "Deep Prison Refining Demon" has a 15% damage reduction to good damage, unless Zhao Xu and his team use good weapons, in which case all damage caused will be reduced by 15 HP.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

For those with low hit rates but high attack frequencies, they are extremely deadly. Therefore, most warriors have enough money to buy magical weapons on their own. However, the "Deep Furnace of Demons" has a feature that is very frustrating for them, which is that its magical resistance is as high as 32.

This means that even if Zhao Xu has a spellcaster level of 6, he is still unable to penetrate the opponent's magical resistance. However, Zhao Xu is very rational and has already thought about this point, saying, "I have prepared the 'Flash Dust' spell, which is really not right. I'll just throw this spell and then make a run for it."

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, Wang Qingwei also nodded slightly. "Mr. Zhongxia, the 'Flash Dust' spell is indeed effective. However, if you really run away, don't worry about us two."

As a famous two-circle spell, 'Flash Dust' not only breaks through stealth states but also does not consume magical resistance. Once the spell fails to succeed, the target will fall into a state of blindness.

After hearing Zhao Xu's preparation of this spell, the two women were clear that Zhao Xu had also thought about the possibility of running away if things didn't go well. Otherwise, leaving a revival stone here would be too expensive.

Slowly, Zhao Xu led the two women and finally arrived at the destination, a ruined watchtower.

The watchtower had five floors and was basically built using red bricks. After many years of history, the outer walls had almost fallen off.

At the same time, the wasteland in front of the watchtower was covered with a variety of grasses and trees, as if it had received more nourishment.

This made Zhao Xu's heart feel uneasy with bad guesses.

Even if it's a magical greenhouse, the energy supply is balanced and won't show any unusual signs.

The only explanation is that there must be a special energy transmission.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xuyi chose to come here precisely because of that special legend, which seemed to be a rumor about a mischievous devil that had caused chaos in the military camp and made it fall into disrepair.

At the same time, the place was empty and deserted, which was somewhat unexpected by Zhao Xuyi, who thought there would be many people paying attention to it.

"Shall we take a look inside?" Eswei hoped, looking at the already rotten and crumbling wooden doorframe.

Zhao Xuyi nodded slightly, "Let's start being cautious. I'll go in first."

At this point, Zhao Xuyi raised the wooden stick in his hand and slowly approached the watchtower that was too big for ten people to hold hands.
