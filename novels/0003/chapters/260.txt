Chapter 261: The Battle Erupts

"This is our combat plan for the next step?" Zhang Qi looked at the tactical route map handed to him by Cui Lu, gazing at the plain in front of the lake below the hill, and couldn't help but think deeply.

"Yes, everyone has made up their minds, regardless of the situation, we will definitely break through the enemy's defenses and enter the small town by tomorrow," Cui Lu said to Zhang Qi, as Feng Ge, Zhang Qi's girlfriend, also arrived on the battlefield and looked at the map drawn by Cui Lu.

"So, the 4th-level players are quite formidable, and they can directly overturn others' plans, making everyone follow their will," Zhang Qi said, looking at the map that made him a bit dizzy.

"The main point is that the plan is reasonable enough," Feng Ge said.

However, the players of the Antidote Alliance had also proposed suggestions in the plan.
However, due to the many opinions and voices in the alliance, they couldn't always execute their own will.

"In the end, it's still about level," Zhang Qi sighed. "Level is high, and regardless of whether it's reasonable or not, others will listen to what you say."

Half a minute later, the temporary base camp set up behind them suddenly echoed with the sound of charging drums.

Instantly, the numerous players gathered on the hill, all with serious expressions, knew that it was time to execute today's combat plan.

Zhang Qi gripped the hilt of his double-handed giant sword, adjusted the armor he had repaired, and gazed at the 30 professional players of varying professions who had reorganized according to the combat plan, shouting, "Let's go!"

At this moment, Starfall Town also noticed that the players had launched a new attack and simultaneously lit the beacon fire, continuously sending signals away.

Since yesterday afternoon, a cold wave has been falling over the Starfall Lake area, covering the ground with a thick layer of white "snow blanket". Besides, the players felt the coldness of the snow as they marched, which slowed down their pace.

In contrast, Starfall Town's unique "Heavy Armor Cavalry Regiment" had to transform into a heavy infantry due to the heavy snow.

From the sky, the entire plain in front of Starfall Lake appeared to be scattered with small teams of players, launching a pincer attack on the entire lake.

The frontline players' troops, with most following the plan, advanced steadily.

As if anticipating the empty battlefield of today, the plan had arranged high-level scouts to search ahead, searching for any hidden traps beneath the snow.

The majority of the rear forces also advanced according to their signals, pushing forward continuously.

In each team, the frontline warriors, abandoning their weapons, held only shields, facing the fierce winds, and advancing forward.

Snowflakes were falling on the players who had taken special measures to keep warm, but they didn't immediately melt away, instead slowly dyeing their armor with a white camouflage color.

The warriors holding the shields, meanwhile, were tightly holding half-human-high shields, trying to cover their entire body from potential attacks.

Most of them wore half-armor, consisting of chainmail and plate armor, protecting vital parts of their bodies.
Here is the translation of the text:

Behind them stood another batch of warriors, although they were only equipped with light armor, they were all equipped with long spears and lances, and as soon as combat broke out, they would take cover behind their shields and then strike out with their long weapons.

The barbarian players were also standing alongside them, except for a few human barbarians, most of them were half-elf barbarians. They were holding giant swords, heavy swords, and other powerful melee weapons, many of which they had just obtained that morning and had not yet been properly maintained.

According to the plan, these barbarians would launch a fierce charge towards the front lines as soon as combat broke out.

At the same time, the bards, who were scattered across the battlefield, began to sing the "War Song". This song, which was a professional skill, gave all players within its range a 1-level increase in attack power and damage output.

The rogue and ranger players were constantly on the lookout for aerial attacks from the enemy, ready to dodge any incoming arrow rain.

Meanwhile, the priests on the battlefield were preparing to cast their blessings according to the battle plan. This spell, similar to the bard's "War Song", increased the attack power of players within its range. Moreover, the spell's area of effect was 15 meters in radius, making it easy to affect a large number of people.

This was in line with the requirements of the battle plan. Alternatively, it could be said that only the 4th-level mage "Star Shadow" had enough reputation to convincingly persuade the high-ranking officials of the counter-attack alliance to release this group buff spell, rather than holding back a healing spell to treat emergencies.
Here's the translation of the text:

Regarding the profession of patrolling the forest, those who specialize in long-range shooting are generally stationed at the rear position.

Most of them re-equipped themselves with hundreds of brand new arrows in the morning.

According to the plan, their task is to maintain long-range arrow suppression during the battle.

Zhou Xu's battle plan yesterday was actually centered around a single concept -

Unleashing a massive force in a short period of time to crush the defense of Star Lake.

Players who died in the battle were revived and re-entered the battlefield. This is also the reason why Zhou Xu needs to unleash a powerful punch that can knock down the enemy.

It's not just a matter of exchanging blows and exhausting each other.

This is also the reason why the battle could not continue yesterday afternoon and was delayed until the next day.

His plan convinced the major guilds and studios to contribute their limited weapons and arrows, pooling their resources together.

After the battle, they will replenish their supplies by selling off the profits from the mines in Star Lake.

This is the high-stakes gamble he convinced everyone to take part in.

As the main force advanced, the soldiers at the front line were puzzled.

Their speed was not fast, but compared to yesterday, the obstacles on the battlefield seemed to have disappeared.

The snowstorms even slowed them down slightly.

The private guards, heavy-armed cavalry, winter wolves, and archer teams of Star Lake all disappeared.

"Everyone, be vigilant and slow down a bit," the commanders said.

Many commanders had already noticed that the distance they had advanced today was actually farther than yesterday's progress.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without any obstacles, it would take no more than 10-20 minutes for them to walk to the city gate of "Starfall Town" on foot. However, just as they were about to arrive, the ground in front of them turned into a vast expanse of white, with countless snowflakes swirling around, making it impossible to see what lay ahead.

"Scatter, there are giant stones!" Suddenly, a wandering member of the team stumbled upon something unusual in the wind and snow.

After hearing this, the players quickly raised their shields, which were locked onto their iron gloves, and looked warily at the danger lurking in the depths of the storm.

Just then, a giant stone, half as tall as a person, soared through the air and landed with a loud "Crash!" The sound of the stone hitting the ground was deafening, and it created a deep crater in the muddy soil.

However, Zhang Qi didn't see the stone's shadow again, but he heard more stones falling from the sky.

Even he could feel the ground shaking beneath his feet.

But before he could celebrate, he saw that the sky in front of him was filled with three or four giant stones hurtling towards him like cannonballs.

"How many catapults are there?" Zhang Qi exclaimed in disbelief.

"Take cover, there are too many stones!" one of the players cried out in distress.

At this moment, the sounds of the battle were interspersed with the cries of the wandering poets, and the stones' crashing sounds echoed across the battlefield.

The battlefield in front of Starfall Lake was blanketed in a hail of giant stones that had been unleashed from the stormy skies.

Each stone, half as tall as a person, weighed over a thousand catties, and even a slight touch would be enough to shatter one's bones into pieces.

The players reformed their formation, but before they could encounter the enemy, they were suddenly scattered by the surprise attack of the giant stone hail.

"Ah——"
Here is the translation of the text:

A wanderer clad in chainmail armor cried out in agony, thinking that this armor would allow him to move freely, but he failed to notice a massive stone coming his way and was struck down by the impact.

The surrounding players were shocked and frightened by the scene. The stone, which had been thrown, was still burning with fierce flames, making it difficult for them to dodge.

Suddenly, scouts from the front line of the wandering party let out a blood-curdling scream as they fell to their deaths. Meanwhile, a group of giants emerged from the snowy veil in the distance, their massive bodies towering over the players at around 3-4 meters tall.

These giants were mostly covered in half-armor or leather clothing and gazed at the player group with an unblinking stare, as if they were gazing at prey. The giants were mainly composed of "Fire Giants", "Glacial Giants", and a few "Mountain Giants". They wielded massive axes and swords, exuding a sense of ferocity.

The leader of the Fire Giants had a retinue of "Infernal Hounds" and "Two-Headed Giants" behind him, while the leader of the Glacial Giants was accompanied by a horde of Glacial Giants, "Winter Wolves", and "Man-Eaters". The players, who had never seen such a massive horde of monsters before, were frozen in shock.
