Chapter 661 - Counterattack and Strategy

It must be said that Zhao Xu's "Weakness Technique" is not a priority move in a magical battle, and even in this scenario, its greatest value lies in its ability to effortlessly bypass the "Invalidation Barrier" without any obstacles.

The "Weakness Technique" itself belongs to the category of "Coercive" magic in the "Control" system, with a psychological impact that makes it extremely susceptible to countermeasures.

If the opponent were to deploy a minute-level "Defense against Evil" or a 10-minute level "Anti-Good Law Array" beforehand, they would be able to directly immunize against Zhao Xu's magic.

However, Zhao Xu is uncertain about the specific situation of the opponent, but the magical aura emitted by the surrounding environment does not have any issues in this regard.

He is certain that there is no "Anti-Good/Chaos Array" targeting his team in this area.

Once the "Weakness Technique" hits the opponent, and they fail, the subsequent result of their intelligence and charm falling to 1 is an excessive gain.

A mage who has almost lost his intelligence would mean that he can no longer cast spells, understand language, or communicate, and can only rely on instinct to recognize allies and follow their actions.

Moreover, removal spells that can remove curses and negative states from within three layers cannot alleviate the effects of the "Weakness Technique", and at least a six-layer medical spell is required to have an effect.

Although this spell is targeting the willpower of the mage, who is a high-will mage, the "Weakness Technique" naturally has a 4-level negative effect on the mage's magical abilities.

When encountering a group of wizards, starting with a "chain spell" combination with "weakness spell" often allows you to defeat a batch of low-level wizards and avoid the possibility of being bitten to death by the ants.

Zhao Xu's thoughts in his mind are very clear.

A formidable opponent with high difficulty in casting spells first uses a defensive barrier like "spell invalidation" to represent their opponent's obvious "yield" and "steadiness" characteristics.

This opponent is waiting for his chance to strike, taking advantage of the fact that the alchemist has a large number of "spell slots" due to their high fallen value.

In the eyes of this deformed man, he thinks he can consume himself more than Zhao Xu, so he's not afraid to engage in a prolonged battle.

However, it is Zhao Xu with "potential points" who is best at engaging in prolonged battles, known as "unconquerable existence".

As for other attribute damage methods, considering that the opponent is an alchemist, he is naturally facing a blood-red devil's method, so there are certainly enough countermeasures.

So Zhao Xu decided to try it.

Only wizards who cannot think can say that they have eliminated the last bit of danger.

Even if Zhao Xu has the ability to dispel all negative states with "iron heart force", he cannot think of how to use it when he loses his intelligence.

This is the terrifying nature of bringing "intelligence" to the bottom, disintegrating all counterattacks and exploding again.

However, the alchemist on the other side made the same move as Zhao Xu, tightly grasping the "power wand" and waving it wildly, making people's eyes spin.

In the instant when Zhao Xu's "weakness spell" took shape.

Countering spell!

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that the energy of his "weakness spell" had dissipated, like autumn leaves falling.

Is there really no immune coercion effect?

Zhao Xu's mind was filled with extremely great doubts.
Here is the translation of the text:

He first used the "Weak Intelligence Technique", which is essentially a "deception" of a high level. He can only cast up to five-layer spells, and when he uses this technique, it is undoubtedly a "complete illusion" that gives opponents absolute despair.

Just as he was about to finish off his opponent with the "Three Iron Fists" and say "I'll commit suicide if I don't kill you", who would have thought that the opponent would use the simplest "Counter Spell" technique?

The Counter Spell technique is the first lesson taught to apprentices in the wizarding world and is truly remarkable in its effectiveness. This technique is often used in group battles, where three wizards can counter three spells with two counter spells.

For example, in a six-on-six battle, the Counter Spell technique can be used to "exchange" two spells for each opponent's spell, effectively reducing the number of spells to four. This is also the reason why the wizarding association rarely fails to capture rebellious wizards.

Specializing in the Counter Spell technique allows wizards to completely dominate opponents who are not familiar with it. For example, a wizard who specializes in the Counter Spell technique, like Anniya, can use this technique to cancel hundreds of spells in a single round.

The Counter Spell technique is also the biggest weakness of Zhao Xu at this moment. When facing a group of wizards, he is like a lone warrior with two fists against four hands. This is also the key reason why he needs to learn the "Red Jade Guard" technique. However, the opponent in front of him is actually a lone warrior? Little does he know that the Counter Spell technique is essentially using one spell to cancel out another.
Here is the translation of the text:

Desiring to counter with divine magic, "Mastery of Counter-Casting" is a specialty that can be learned, allowing for the use of higher-rank magic to counter. However, without exception, it is impossible to prepare an exact replica of the magic.

Even if the opponent's magical prowess far surpasses that of a general mage, relying on "Counter-Casting" to win is not a viable approach. Using the same magic, the opponent can employ dirty tactics to counterattack and gain an advantage.

As Zhao Xu became perplexed, he suddenly discovered that the "magical energy" that had just been shattered was recondensing.

Furthermore, the powerful energy was directed at him - it was none other than Su Mu's!

In this moment, Zhao Xu suddenly had an epiphany.

No wonder the opponent would waste a five-rank or higher magical technique to counterattack him.

The high-ranking mage's professional skills and advanced magical abilities, which can only be learned by sacrificing a seven-rank magical technique, allowed him to master "Counter-Casting"!

With this ability, the counter-casting magic will be influenced like a seven-rank magical technique "Counter-Conversion" and rebound back to the opponent.

Completely unreasonable tactics!

Instantly, Zhao Xu's "Mental Barrier" recovered after shedding the "Frenzied Mumbling" and directly blocked his own "Weakness Spell".

Even if he dodged, there were still "Anti-Evil Array" and "Merciful Blessing of the Martyrs" and other spells that could shield him from his own magic.

Moreover, compared to the counter-conversion point, the opponent might be a seven-rank mage, which made Zhao Xu's heart skip a beat.

This means that the opponent might be a seven-rank mage.
After mastering the "Limited Wish Art" at the level of seven rings, this spell, which consumes less life energy compared to the "Wish Art" of nine rings, can still produce remarkable effects. It is often a key factor in turning the tide of battle.

For example, a ordinary citizen, holding a "+1 Executioner's Sword" (+5 execution value), can, under the protection of the "Limited Wish Art", guarantee a hit with the next attack, regardless of the opponent's defense level. Combining it with the "Tears of Sorrow" to bring a devastating threat, it is almost certain to succeed, even if the opponent is a legendary "Huntress of the Giant" who has a nearly legendary level of around ten. This is also the value of the "Immunity to Death" effect.

So, facing a seven-ring mage, Zhao Xiu can hardly estimate the opponent's possibilities. However, he is still puzzled.

Why would the opponent use the "Wisdom Staff" to waste energy, when they could simply use a six-ring "Invalidation of Spell" with their bare hands? Moreover, the opponent could also use the seven-ring "Spell Reversal" to make Zhao Xiu's heart quiver with fear.

As Zhao Xiu was thinking this over, a flash of inspiration suddenly occurred to him.

No, it's not possible. Is it seven rings?

But the opponent, who seemed to have used the "Spell Reversal" effect, inadvertently revealed a small detail.

The opponent didn't know the extent of Zhao Xiu's abilities, otherwise they would have been clear that he wasn't afraid of "Weak Wisdom".

At this moment, the deformed man who had completed the spell reversal stared at Zhao Xiu's eyes with an increasingly sinister and crazy look.

His eyes were already filled with blood vessels, and they seemed to have a subtle, almost imperceptible, darkness, as if a small worm was crawling through them.

The stench of decay from the grave, which was even more intense than before, was emanating from the opponent's body. This was the same sensation Zhao Xiu had experienced when facing a half-god mummy.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xiu couldn't help but ask.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As the body technique's momentum waned, Zhao Xu also asked this question.

Even if he could slightly disrupt his opponent's thoughts, he had already gained something.

In a wizard battle, every detail counts, and he needed to be meticulous.

"You already know," the opponent, a chemist-turned-wizard, said with a smile, his mouth filled with rotten teeth that looked like corroded iron, making it impossible to see a single intact tooth.

Even as he spoke, he was constantly swallowing blood that had erupted from his lungs due to his violent movements.

Could he still be alive?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but doubt the opponent's "focus" level, which was terrifying just in this state.

"Prey, now it's my turn," the deformed, polluted wizard sneered, his eyes flashing with a completely crazy meaning.

He still couldn't see through it.

Zhao Xu shook his head, and since that was the case, he would have to hold on for another round.

He continued to swing his "Momentary Release Wand," activating the remaining power.

As someone with a specialization in "Momentary Release," Zhao Xu could undoubtedly combine this specialty with the "Momentary Release" technique to transform it into a "Quick Release" technique, effectively casting two spells in one round.

However, his "Over Magic Control" required more time, completely conflicting with "Momentary Release."

Therefore, he wanted to release the spell, and if he couldn't, he would have to rely on his 3rd-level Over Magic Master ability to reduce the spell's level by one ring, allowing him to release a 2-ring spell.

Note: Some sentences may need slight adjustments for better readability.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he held the pure metal staff, he could cast a high-level spell every day, and it has been in use until now. This time, Zhao Xushu waved the staff with a mere flick of his wrist, relying on the "instant release" effect to complete the compression of his spell. From the syllables to his posture, every movement was fluid and harmonious.

At this moment, Zhao Xushu finally felt the effect of the "Howard Convenience Bag" given to him by Anzhi. He could grab anything he wanted by simply reaching into the side pocket. Unlike the "Weak Magic" that required dirt, water crystals, glass, or mineral balls, which he might not be able to take out from his backpack even after rummaging through it for a few minutes. Even a skilled magician who had sewn and patched his robes to resemble a beggar's clothing would struggle to find the right materials during a battle.

As Zhao Xushu took out a perfectly polished gemstone, it was as smooth as silk. The five-ring spell, "Ling Bi!" was accompanied by a swirling, swirling ball of white-green color that surrounded Zhao Xushu.

On the outside, he let out a low, mournful sigh that seemed to pierce the very heart of the soul. Any living being that confronted Ling Bi would fail to withstand the temptation and eventually succumb to madness, fleeing wildly for 1-4 rounds. Any living being that dared to touch Ling Bi would suffer 1-10 points of damage due to life force disruption. If they attempted to cross through Ling Bi, they would receive negative levels.

More astonishingly, this gemstone exists in a half-physical, non-transparent form, capable of providing complete concealment effects. Moreover, it can block magical effects, including all kinds of spellcasting abilities and supernatural powers. This means that the opponent can only make magic effective by entering the sphere, and even then, they will be trapped in the "invalidation boundary" sphere, with both spheres unable to move. The opponent's magic will no longer be able to penetrate Zhao's "spirit gem," no matter how many layers it has, unless the gem is first dispelled. However, Zhao's five-layer magic can still break through the boundary. Zhao uses this magic to further probe the opponent's response.

It's as if a basketball game, where the three threats are decided by the opponent's subsequent response. As for the opponent, the chemist, at this moment, only shook his body slightly, revealing a deep-thinking expression. It's just as Zhao had expected, and the opponent has also wrapped himself in a higher-level flash technique. Instantly, he gains fourfold effects: physical attacks are 50% ineffective, single-target spells are 50% ineffective, area attacks deal 50% damage, and preparation actions are 100% evasive. However, this has no effect on Zhao, who is on the spiritual plane. Zhao continues to cast his magic with ease.

Then, he unleashes the five-layer spell "Thief of Magic!" to steal the opponent's magic for himself. Eventually, the deformed man's face turns pale, and he directly adopts a new approach: "Dispelling Magic!" The deformed man shouts loudly: "Is this not the six-layer 'Higher Dispelling Magic'?" Zhao's inner heart finally relaxes, and he shows a confident expression. In essence, dispelling magic is a competition between the "spellcasting levels" of both parties.
This item will never lose to anyone, not even the Nine Rings Master!
