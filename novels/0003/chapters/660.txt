Chapter 661: Counterattack and Tactics

It's undeniable that Zhao Xu's "Weak Intelligence" technique is not a primary strategy in the realm of magic warfare, and it's even more so in this scenario where it can effortlessly bypass the "Invalidation of Magic" boundary. This technique belongs to the "Coercion" category of magic and has a profound impact on the mind, making it extremely vulnerable to countermeasures.

If the opponent had used a minute-level "Protection of Good" or a ten-minute-level "Anti-Good Barrier" beforehand, they could directly immunize themselves against Zhao Xu's magic.

However, Zhao Xu is unaware of the specific circumstances surrounding his opponent, but the magical aura emanating from the surrounding environment does not pose a problem in this regard.

He is certain that there is no "Anti-Good/Hysteria Barrier" targeting his faction.

Once "Weak Intelligence" hits the opponent, causing them to fail, the resulting loss of intelligence and charm, with intelligence and charm plummeting to 1, is an excessive gain.

A mage who has almost lost his intelligence can no longer cast spells, understand language, or communicate, and can only recognize friends by instinct and follow their actions.

Moreover, even the most powerful spell to remove curses, which can eliminate negative states, cannot alleviate the effects of "Weak Intelligence," and at least a six-ringed healing spell is required to take effect.

Although this technique is directed at the opponent's will, and mages are known for their strong willpower, "Weak Intelligence" inherently has a negative effect on mages, reducing their willpower by 4 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

When encountering a group of mages, starting with a "chain spell" and combining it with "Weak Intellect", one can often defeat a batch of low-level mages and avoid the possibility of being bitten to death by ants.

Zhao Xun's thoughts are very clear in his mind.

A mage with a high degree of difficulty in spell immunity, who is also a master of "Ineffective Spell Boundary", represents the opponent's obvious surrender and stability. This opponent is waiting for an opportunity to strike, taking advantage of Zhao Xun's high potential points and the fact that he has a large number of spell slots.

In this deformed man's eyes, he himself is more capable of consuming Zhao Xun, so he is not afraid to engage in a prolonged battle.

However, Zhao Xun, who possesses "Potential Points", is the one who is most capable of engaging in a prolonged battle, and is known as a being that cannot be killed.

As for other attributes and damage methods, considering that the opponent is a toxic chemist, there is always a way to respond to the opponent's methods, such as the "Bloodthirsty Devil" technique.

So Zhao Xun decided to try it first.

Only a mage who cannot think can say that he has eliminated the last bit of danger.

Even if Zhao Xun has the ability to eliminate all negative states with "Iron Heart", he would not be able to think of how to use it when he loses his intelligence.

This is the terrifying aspect of "Intellectual Decline", which can dissolve all counterattacks and suddenly explode.

However, the opponent, a toxic chemist, made the same move as Zhao Xun, tightly gripping the "Powerful Staff" in his hand and waving it wildly, making it seem like a whirlwind.

In the instant when Zhao Xun's "Weak Intellect" spell was formed.

Counterspell!

Zhao Xun suddenly realized that the energy of his "Weak Intellect" spell was completely dispersed, like autumn leaves falling.

Is there really no immune coercion effect?

Zhao Xun's mind was flooded with extreme doubts.
Here is the translation of the text:

He first used the "Weakness Technique", which is essentially a "deception" or a "feint". At most, he could only cast five-ring magic, and only a few times, and then he would use this trick, which would undoubtedly create an "absolute illusion" for others.

Just as he was about to say "I'll finish off these three hammers, and if I can't kill you, I'll kill myself" on the public screen.

Who could have expected it?

It turned out that the opponent was using the "most primitive" "Counter Spell"?
As a fundamental lesson for apprentices, the Counter Spell is indeed extraordinary in effectiveness.

This is also a common method for wizards to defend themselves against multiple opponents.

For example, three against one, which is essentially using six spells to counter two spells (active + instant).

In the six-spell array, relying on the Counter Spell, it is possible to achieve "two for two", turning the six spells against two spells into four null spells.

This is also the reason why the Wizard's Association rarely fails to apprehend rebellious wizards who use enemy magic.

Regardless of how many specialized wizards combine their Counter Spell expertise, they can undoubtedly defeat these inexperienced wizards, making them cry and doubt themselves deeply.

Like Anniya, who masters the "Legendary Counter Spell" expertise, she can even cancel hundreds of spells in a single round.
The Counter Spell technique is also Zhao Xiu's greatest weakness at the moment.

Facing a group of wizards, he is no match for them, which is also the key reason why he needs to join the "Red Jade Guard".
However, the man in front of him seems to be a lone wolf?

It's worth noting that Counter Spell is essentially using one spell to cancel another spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Mastering the art of countering spells requires great skill and can be used to counter high-level spells. However, it's impossible to prepare a spell that is identical to the opponent's. Even if the opponent's spell is far beyond what a typical mage can cast, relying on the "countering spell" to win is not a viable strategy. If the opponent uses the same spell, they can counterattack with a higher-level spell, making it even more difficult to counter.

Zhao Xu was perplexed, but then suddenly realized that the "spell energy" that had been defeated by the opponent was recondensing. The powerful energy was now targeting him. It was Su Mu, the legendary mage, who was known for his unparalleled mastery of the arts.

Zhao Xu had an epiphany and understood why the opponent would waste a five-ring or higher spell to counter him. A high-level mage with advanced skills and the ability to master the "countering spell" can learn to control the spell. Once mastered, the spell can be used to turn the opponent's spell back against them.

The "mind shield" that Zhao Xu had regained after breaking free from the "crazy nonsense" had a direct impact on his "weakness spell". Even if he tried to dodge, the opponent's "evil barrier" and "merciful aid" spells could also be used to shield himself from the spell.

Compared to the spell countering, the opponent's information was likely that of a seven-ring mage, which made Zhao Xu feel uneasy. This meant that the opponent was likely a seven-ring mage.
After mastering the "Limited Wish Technique" at the seventh circle, this spell, which consumes less life energy compared to the "Wish Technique" at the ninth circle, can still create extraordinary effects. It often turns the tide of battle.

For example, a ordinary person, holding a "+1 Execution Sword" (+5 execution value) under the protection of the "Limited Wish Technique", can guarantee a hit with the next stroke, regardless of the opponent's defense level. Combining this with the crushing threat from "Lamentation Melody", the opponent will inevitably succumb to the attack, even if they are a legendary "Huntmaster" with nearly 10-level skill.

This is the value of the "Immune to Death" effect.

Therefore, facing a seventh-circle mage like Zhao Xu, it is impossible to predict the opponent's possibilities. However, he is still perplexed.

Why would the opponent waste energy using the "Powerful Wand" when they can use a sixth-circle "Ineffective Spell Barrier" with their bare hands? Moreover, the opponent can also use the seventh-circle "Spell Reversal" to make Zhao Xu retreat with fear.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking this, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck his mind.

No, it's not that the seventh circle is dubious.

However, the opponent's apparent use of spell reversal has revealed a flaw.

The opponent cannot clearly discern his true abilities, otherwise they would be aware that he is not afraid of "Weak Intelligence Techniques".

At this time, the deformed man who had completed the spell countermeasure looked at Zhao Xu with increasingly evil and mad eyes. His pupils were already filled with blood, and his eyes seemed to have fine, fine worms crawling through them. The stench of decay from the grave emanating from his body was even more intense, reminiscent of a half-divine mummy.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.
As the opponent's body manipulation art ebbed and flowed, Zhao Xu also asked this question.

No matter how slightly he could disrupt the opponent's thoughts, he would still gain an advantage.

In every duel of magic, every detail mattered.

"You already know," said the opposite party, a smile spreading across his face, his teeth like rotten iron and copper, completely unrecognizable. Even as he spoke, he was swallowing blood that had burst forth from his lungs due to his frantic movements.

Can he still be alive?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but doubt the opponent's "focus" level, which was terrifying. That he could still perfectly execute his magic in this state was extremely rare.

"The prey is now mine," said the deformed body of the corrupted mage, his eyes flashing with a completely insane meaning.

It was still hard to penetrate.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, since that was the case. Then he would just have to wait one more round.

He continued to swing his "Instant Release Rod", activating its remaining power.

As someone who had mastered the "Instant Release" specialty, Zhao Xu could undoubtedly combine his magic with this specialty to turn it into an instant-release magic, effectively converting "casting" to "swift".

As a result, he could cast two spells in one round of time.

However, his "Supernatural Control" required more time, completely conflicting with "Instant Release".

Therefore, he wanted to instant-release a spell, either by simply leveling up three circles or by using a five-circle spell to instant-release a two-circle spell.

This was still relying on his 3rd-level ability as a master of supernatural control, allowing the attached effects to decrease by one circle, otherwise he could only instant-release a one-circle spell.
Here is the translation:

Therefore, the staff in his hand, forged from pure metal, can release a ninth-level magic spell every day, and it has been fully utilized to this day.

This time, Zhao Xu only needs to swing the staff once, relying on the "instantaneous release" effect, and his spell is completed in the final compression.

From the syllable to the posture, and even the material, the entire action is seamless.

At this moment, Zhao Xu has finally felt the effect of the "Howard Convenience Bag" given to him by Anzini.

He can get whatever he wants by stretching his hand into the side pocket, and he can get whatever he wants.

Otherwise, the "Weakness Spell" requires materials such as clay, crystal, glass, or a small stone ball, which he may not be able to find in his backpack even after searching for a few minutes.

As for the robe made by the Beggar Clan, although each pocket contains corresponding spell materials, it will cause chaos during a battle, with people scrambling to take things from different pockets and trying to figure out how much to take.

Therefore, when Zhao Xu pulls out a perfectly polished gemstone at this moment, it is as smooth as a cloud and has no seams.

Five-ring spell--- "Spirit Jade!"

Surrounding Zhao Xu is a spiral-shaped, green-white ball of light, accompanied by a low, mournful sigh that sounds like a painful cry, piercing the heart.

Any living being that confronts the Spirit Jade will fail to resist its will and collapse in 1-4 rounds, followed by a frantic escape.

Any living creature that dares to touch the jade will receive 1-10 points of damage due to life force disruption, and if it dares to cross the jade, it will suffer from negative levels.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

More exaggeratedly, this crystal exists in a half-material, non-transparent form, providing a complete concealment effect. Moreover, it can block magical effects, including all kinds of magical and supernatural abilities. In other words, the opponent can only make their magic effective once they enter the sphere. However, the opponent is hiding within the "invalidation boundary" of the sphere, making it impossible for both spheres to move. The opponent's magic cannot penetrate Zhao's "spirit crystal", no matter how hard they try, unless they first dispel the crystal. However, Zhao's five-ring magic can bypass the boundary. Zhao uses this magic to probe the situation, like a basketball player making a shot, and decides to break through in a direction based on the opponent's response.

As for the opponent, a chemist, he merely twitched his body slightly, showing a thoughtful expression, as if he had anticipated Zhao's move. Zhao expected this and promptly cast another spell.

"Steal Magic!" Zhao exclaimed, taking control of the opponent's magic.

The deformed man suddenly let out a loud roar, "Is this not the six-ring 'Higher-level Magic Dispel'?"

Zhao's inner turmoil finally subsided, and he revealed a confident expression.

At its core, dispelling magic is a competition of "magician levels" between the two parties.
This phrase translates to: "This one has never lost to anyone, not even the Nine Rings Sorcerer!"
