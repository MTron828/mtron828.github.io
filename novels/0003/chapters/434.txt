Chapter 435: Harvesting Death

The higher-order artifact exudes an irresistible charm, making it impossible to discern who is responsible for the crime zone. The target's level is enormous, causing a massive gap between the general and the giant. Various factors converge to make it impossible for someone to speak up and negotiate with Zhao Xu, even opening their mouth. Suddenly, an arrow shoots towards the target "Zhong Xia" but misses and veers off course.

"How can he fly?"

"The Anti-Magic Zone has disappeared!" someone exclaims.

As a result, the entire asteroid crater area is instantly electrified, foreshadowing the return of magical power to this ordinary land within a 50-kilometer radius.

"Kill him first, and the artifact will choose its master. The shrine said that if the Earth player dies, the artifact will be dropped," someone shouts, taking advantage of the chaos to spread this rumor.

The faction advocating for a detailed discussion with Zhao Xu is instantly suppressed.

In the end, everything happens too quickly, disrupting everyone's preparation time.

Time suddenly compresses to just two days, leaving the true power holders behind the scenes no time to intervene, let alone make a decision regarding the exchange coupon for "Zhong Xia". Not even the basic verification of whether the other side has an artifact's authorization can be proposed, because conspiracy theorists know that the true negotiation will not fall to the weaker side.

Only by stirring up the present situation, making it unbearable, can one have a chance to catch their breath and seize the opportunity. Accompanied by the second arrow shot into the sky, even a warrior directly activates the "Flying Shoes" on their feet and takes off towards Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Flying Broom, the Flying Magic Carpet, the Bat Cape, and the Flying Mount - all kinds of flying methods are conjured up, as if they have reached the realm of the gods. It's not that people underestimate players, but rather that players are currently at the lowest level, only level 6, which is difficult to respect.

If Zhao Xiu were a legendary strongman to appear above, only a few would dare to come forward to join the fun, trying to get a share of the spoils. However, they would not think that Zhao Xiu could counterattack them.

"I haven't obtained a divine artifact," Zhao Xiu said, as an ordinary arrow passed by him without causing any harm. Then, he used the second-level magic spell "Majestic Sound" and shouted.

Under the effect of the spell, his voice became loud and clear, able to be transmitted over a long distance. The spell's range expanded by 30 meters per level, allowing Zhao Xiu's voice to spread to a radius of several hundred meters, equivalent to four or five soccer fields.

Suddenly, his voice directly suppressed the commotion and chaos below. Even those with ambitious intentions stopped in their tracks, trying to analyze his actions.

"Tomorrow, the major organizations will prove this point," Zhao Xiu said, his second sentence as concise as the first.

However, the noise below started to get loud, with people shouting, "I hope you can live until tomorrow!" "Take everything out of your backpack, and we'll believe you!" "Kid, we'll divide the divine artifact among us, and the Star Alliance will protect you!" "Lend us one month, and then return it, in exchange for the price of one month's protection!"

The various voices rose and fell, with everyone knowing that they had been compressed to just two days, giving them the chance to be "shrimp soldiers" and "crab generals." It's true that if they had dragged on for the original six days, at least eight-tenths of the people present would not have qualified to be here.
However, Zhao Xu continued to say, "These two sentences are not to explain to you. It's to tell you that anyone who enters the hundred-meter radius will die."

After saying that, he revealed a determined expression.

"Haha, this old hat still has the flair of my youth."
"I'm going in, no matter what happens."
"Don't waste time talking to him, let's kill him first," a burly bandit advised those around him.

At the same time, a larger number of arrows continued to fly towards Zhao Xu, but only occasionally hit, and even then, they were deflected by his stardust cloak.

Zhao Xu shook his head silently in response.

Anyway, he had already warned them, and now it was time to prove it with his fists.
"Fireball Technique!"
Zhao Xu swung out his eternal magic staff, which was not aimed at the ground but directly at the adventurers who were flying towards him.

Instantly, the small fireball paused in mid-air before exploding and sending a massive wave of flames that engulfed several adventurers who were caught off guard.
"Ahh——"
As these people screamed in pain, their entire bodies turned into a ball of fire and plummeted to the ground.

"That's the kid from the Three Circles School!"
"Don't make a fuss, that's the staff of the other party, what a fool," someone said.

As the black market hub, a group of people immediately recognized the magic Zhao Xu had just released and the technique he used.

However, they didn't know that the wooden stick that looked like a fireball technique was actually a permanent recovery method, used twice a day.

Zhao Xu didn't waste any time and immediately unleashed a second fireball technique, continuing to lay down a fire net in front of him.

At the same time, more and more adventurers gathered around his feet.

At this point, everyone could no longer see the adventurers who had gone in, but they could only emerge as corpses. Wealth is what can most move people's hearts. Meanwhile, Zhao Xiaoxu was controlling himself, slowly descending. Vivian had already raised the air shield in front of him, with the entire person shielding him.

"He's coming down, charging towards him," most of the people present couldn't fly, and could only envy the other adventurers rushing up.

Who would have thought that this Zhong Xia would be so foolish, flying down to the ground to engage in a real exchange of death with them.

As he looked out at the vast landscape before him, he couldn't see or count the people rushing forward, Zhao Xiaoxu glanced back at the corpses who had entered the Ai Duo Palace and lost their lives.

These were the best fuel for the soul reaping spell.

"Don't block the way, the two-ring Zhong Xia spell has clearly lost its effect."

"Get out of the way, that artifact is mine." A half-human, half-beast savage shouted loudly and flung a flying axe towards Zhao Xiaoxu.

At this moment, a wave of adventurers wielding sharp-edged weapons were approaching him from the direction of the crowd, and their eyes had become somewhat sinister due to their desire.

However, Zhao Xiaoxu simply shook his head.

Even Vivian remained still, only slightly lowering her sword tip, mourning the group of people before him.

Zhao Xiaoxu then faced the crowd and swung his legendary death spell staff—

The Death Array!

As Zhao Xiaoxu determined the center of the spell's effect, a dark and malevolent aura filled with death and slaughter erupted from the center.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, these adventurers who were still full of life, had their lives extinguished in an instant. They directly transformed into stiff corpses, fell to the ground, and stirred up dust on the ground.

"How—"

One of the adventurers, who was shouting in confusion, suddenly stopped speaking.

As a small-team leader who had reached level 8, he was only able to fulfill the team's requirements, so he had come to join the battle. At this moment, he was staring at the corpses of his teammates, who had all died in front of him. The whole process was cold and silent, without a single word spoken.

"It's the instant death spell!"

Suddenly, a spectral warrior, who had narrowly escaped death, knelt down, looking like he was about to faint. Originally, he had been very confident that he could completely dodge the damage from the fireball spell, but after seeing this spell, he almost fainted. 

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was calmly gazing at the corpses in front of him, which had fallen to the ground. The death array spell, which was a six-ring spell, could only kill adventurers below level 9, but Zhao Xu's staff, which was imbued with the power of death, released an output that was twice as powerful as usual. This spell could kill a living being with a total level of 160, and the adventurers who had just arrived, who were mostly level 2-3, were instantly slaughtered by Zhao Xu.

As the adventurers who had surrounded the battlefield gazed at the scene before them, they felt a chill in their hearts. They remembered what Zhan Xia had said, "Don't kill within a radius of 100 meters." "Come on, everyone! That's the power of a godly item. He won't be able to keep releasing it, and we'll get rich by taking it!" "Yeah, let's beat this evil player."
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the nearby forces, which had been mobilized, rushed to the front line.

Instantly, they unleashed a hail of arrows, raining down on Zhao Xu and his companions.

"Thud, thud."
Vivi's silver armor, adorned with intricate patterns, emitted a clear and crisp sound as it absorbed the brunt of the arrow attack.

However, she let out a soft sigh as one arrow pierced through the gap between her armor and her joints, causing her harm.

Zhao Xu let out a sigh in response.

He knew that these unknown forces, which could assemble over 50 people in a short time, were the ones he needed to focus on resolving tonight.

"Death Array!"
On the opposite side of the scene, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate and cast the spell again.

Instantly, the ground seemed to be struck by the Grim Reaper, and the well-equipped warrior team fell to the ground, half of them knocked out.

Although Zhao Xu's Death Array didn't have an overwhelmingly high degree of immunity, the instant death effect of this 29th-level spell would still be intimidating to even a 10th-level player.

"Death Array!"
"Death Array!"
This time, Zhao Xu seemed to show no mercy, using the Death Array spell without hesitation, even though each spell consumed 2 energy.

"Command, we can't hold on! That guy is crazy, we can't just rely on our manpower tactics to win!"

The vice commander of the allied forces, who was being surrounded by Zhao Xu, shouted loudly in front.

Their team was hastily assembled, with many of them being hastily summoned mercenaries. Commanding them was already challenging enough, let alone now that they had suffered heavy losses.

"His energy must not be infinite, quickly replenish it and make sure to achieve a decisive victory."
At this moment, several powerful warriors had already burst forth from the battlefield, charging towards Zhao Xu with a killing intent.

Vivian quickly approached, wielding her long sword and clashing with the enemies.

"It seems the pressure is greater now," she reminded Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu, however, noticed that the enemies surrounding him were growing in number, trampling over the corpses of fallen adventurers as they continued to advance towards them.

Zhao Xu's expression turned solemn, "Let's see who can last longer."

He continued to swing his staff, chanting, "Higher Summoning of the Dead."
