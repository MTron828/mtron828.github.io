Chapter 54: Official Priest

Zhao Xu didn't expect that he had already obtained divine power, and it was suddenly exposed. Fortunately, the other party was the Archbishop of the Order of the Law, with deep roots in the Order of the Law, so the issue wasn't too big.

Ordinarily, Zhao Xu had seen many people like Anniya and Rayan, who could cast spells with just a flick of their hand. This time, the Archbishop of the Order of the Law, an old and honest man, actually followed the proper procedure to cast a spell, bringing a ritual tool with him, which left Zhao Xu stunned.

As a result, he realized that he needed to accelerate his training in the "Divine Spell Identification" skill.

He didn't even recognize the detection of good spells that he himself possessed, which would be too embarrassing to reveal.

It's very difficult for someone to remain hidden as an evil person in the world of Arthur.

Unless one reaches the pinnacle of power, no one dares to casually cast a detection spell on someone.

For example, "Detection of Evil" is a basic ability of the Holy Warriors, which often leads them to constantly struggle against evil.

Many players now seek the Holy Warriors, but only until they get to know the truth, that "the Holy Warriors who sleep are the best" and only then will they understand the meaning of this phrase.

Too many teams have been entangled by the unwavering determination of the Holy Warriors to fight against evil.

This is also the reason why many people like the Holy Warriors as friends but not as teammates.

Zhao Xu, due to his kind and holy nature, has a more obvious effect on the detection of good spells.

Only holy beings with 11HD or above will emit a moderate light under the detection of good spells.

As a holy priest, Zhao Xu, a 1st-level priest is dimly lit, but by the 2nd level, his light will rise to moderate.

Zhao Xu thought this way, suddenly feeling a sense of discomfort.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, no, I chose the absolute neutral camp from the start," said Zhao Xu.

The absolute neutral camp is only one level away from the Magic Goddess, which he had carefully calculated.

The benevolent priest of the Holy Light cannot use those evil elements' spells, so he had to bleed out.

"You're playing it too clever, kiddo, don't you think the absolute neutral camp is that good? When you chose to heal yourself and also had the ability to dispel undead creatures, you chose to dispel," said Lei An with a hint of sarcasm.

"These choices you've made are a self-examination of your own camp, and combined with your behavior over the past half-month, it's natural that your camp has shifted to neutral benevolent," said Lei An.

"The benevolent deity's neutral priest can indeed dispel, but Mr. Zhongxia, you just thought of dispelling without the slightest hesitation, and your camp naturally follows your heart," said the Archbishop.

"Kiddo, since you were born with a benevolent heart, don't try to hide in the neutral camp all day," continued Lei An.

Zhao Xu looked at Lei An with a mixture of embarrassment and frustration.

Zhao Xu was helpless; he couldn't say that he knew the priest of the goddess could only dispel.

He also just realized that his character card had already changed to "neutral benevolent".

Just as he released the ability to dispel undead creatures.

"Hey," Zhao Xu could only let out a deep sigh.

"What's wrong, feeling like you can't use some spells later?" Lei An seemed to see through Zhao Xu's thoughts at a glance.

Zhao Xu suddenly became flustered, and the Holy Light's priest, who was standing beside him with a stern face, couldn't dare to say that he wanted to use those spells with "evil elements".
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't worry, the priest's divine power is given by God, so he won't give you divine power that goes against your faction. However, the spells you learn are yours, and you can use them as you like."

Lei An said this reassuringly.

Zhao Xu listened to this and suddenly thought of something.

Lei An's words were ambiguous, and on the surface, it seemed like he was saying that the priest's art was still free to use. However, in reality, he was referring to the divine power of the dual-attribute elite profession, which would not be restricted.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu realized that being a 1st-level priest was not a bad thing.

"Let's go, go to the training grounds in the backyard and find someone to teach you the basics of combat and weapon skills. Who knows what will happen later," Lei An said, urging Zhao Xu.

As Lei An spoke, Zhao Xu's hands holding the books also helped him put them away. There was no need to be polite to the Archdeacon anymore.

"That's it, then," the Archdeacon said quietly, standing up and disappearing like a gust of wind, leaving no trace.

However, his gaze remained fixed on Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu and Lei An walked to the corridor outside the door, and it was only 30 meters away when he asked quietly, "What did you mean by looking at the Archdeacon with an unexplainable gaze just now?"

"You're still quite observant after being so flamboyant," Lei An said, chewing on a sweet fruit he had just picked, "because he's the Archdeacon, after all."

"Strictly speaking, he's a high-ranking official, with only one or two layers of difference from the Pope and Cardinal in the Church. You just received divine power, and this high-ranking priest wouldn't be able to sense it."

"If God bestowed your ability right in front of him, it's like feeding you with a spoon, and he wouldn't even need to kneel down to pray and praise God."

Zhao Xu was taken aback for a moment. The road to the training grounds was still a distance away, and he continued to ask.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the point?" Zhao Xiu didn't dare to say it too directly, without pointing out that the Archbishop of the Holy See didn't kneel down about this matter.

"Because it wasn't face-to-face," Lai An said with a bad temper.

He turned his head and looked at Zhao Xiu, "I just understood, on the day of the divine birth, the goddess directly granted you all the abilities, it's just that you didn't know. So the goddess didn't come in person, so he definitely wouldn't kneel down."

Zhao Xiu finally understood.

He realized yesterday that he had directly used his own initiative to cast spells and wasn't without a reason, and that he could even find a priest to ask about the realm and the ability to dispel undead creatures. He would automatically obtain these abilities.

He would become a priest by default, whereas others would have to study for years to become one.

This disparity in treatment is indeed a bit exaggerated.

No wonder he was watched by the Archbishop of the Holy See when he left.

The talented and diligent people are not jealous.

However, he had struggled for years to achieve what he wanted, only to see others receive it easily, like getting a pie in the face, including the tablecloth and dishes.

Even a priest who has spent decades cultivating his spirit would feel that fate is unfair.

Not long after, Zhao Xiu and Lai An walked into the training ground.

Many novice priests were here, comparing their skills with each other, holding their weapons, from wooden sticks to hammer handles.

Some novice priests were even wearing heavy armor, feeling how to avoid attacks while wearing armor.

Lai An glanced at the training ground and whispered, "The old man in charge of training probably slacked off again, you wait, he'll probably come back soon."

Zhao Xiu listened silently and didn't say anything, and then walked to an empty space and took a wooden stick from the weapon rack.

"You're not good enough yet, don't play with fire," Lai An said.
Zhao Xu just smiled slightly, holding the wooden staff in his hand, and a familiar feeling surged up his heart. At the same time, he also touched the leather armor hanging on the side.

These are all his old friends from his previous life.

[Adventurer Zhong Xia obtained the skill of expertise in simple weapons (equivalent to the same name specialization)]
[Adventurer Zhong Xia obtained the skill of expertise in light armor (equivalent to the same name specialization)]
[Adventurer Zhong Xia officially promoted to 1st level cleric]

"Hey, hey, don't say you've mastered this too?" Lei An came over and patted Zhao Xu's shoulder, "The divine blessing doesn't include expertise in weapons and armor, it's all about practicing and improving."

"I'm now a 1st level cleric, let's go back to Floating Cloud City," Zhao Xu said with a bad mood.

"..."

In his previous life, he was a 5th level warrior, and under the premise of providing spiritual sustenance for the cleric profession, all these abilities naturally surged up his heart.
