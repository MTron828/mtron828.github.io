Chapter 001 Returning to the Past
"Hey, hey, have you pre-ordered 'Arthur'?"
"Of course, I pre-ordered it half a year ago."
"The game is said to be fully AI-managed, with players leading the world line. Everyone says it's the most free game ever."
"I felt the VR in the trailer was super realistic."
"Didn't they say you can play for more than 4 hours while sleeping? The longest I've played is only 3 hours."
"It's going online tonight, hurry up and invite me, everyone."
Zhao Xu looked at his university classmates discussing enthusiastically with a bewildered look on his face.
The faces of these youthful years in front of him were all memories from 10 years ago.
This scene seemed familiar.
His heart tightened, and countless memories scattered in his mind like flying fluff.
10 years ago, "Arthur" opened today.
Unnoticed, the curtain of the new era quietly opened on this day, ushering in a true great era.
On the first anniversary of Arthur's opening, the earth was suddenly hit by a devastating meteor shower, and all life turned to ashes.
However, humans found themselves crossing into the world of Arthur after the meteor shower.
Former Arthur players perfectly inherited everything from the game.
The upper-level players in the game became the elite among the people of Earth in Arthur, and the original power on Earth was also reshuffled.
In his previous life, Zhao Xu didn't pay attention to this game. It wasn't until almost eight months after it opened that his classmates forcibly dragged him into it to join their class guild.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had an online frequency of three days of playing and two days of idle time in the game until he crossed over. At that time, players who had been playing since the game's launch had already reached an average level of nearly 5, with some even reaching over 10 levels. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who was slow to enter the game, was only at level 2.

As one of the lucky ones who had played this game before its release, Zhao Xu had undoubtedly joined the elite of earth's forces. With his professional level and the help of his classmates, he quickly provided for his family's livelihood.

However, his luck ran out in the end. The small town where he was stationed was attacked by a black dragon that suddenly appeared three years after he crossed over. The casualties numbered in the hundreds, and his family members, including his newlywed wife, all perished in that crisis.

Zhao Xu's life had lost its color from that moment on. He was then summoned by the lord to go to war, narrowly escaping death but carrying the burden of revenge.

For the next six years, he devoted himself to avenging his family's death.

Even until the end of his memories, Zhao Xu joined an expedition team to讨黑龙. However, before they could enter the black dragon's lair, the team was ambushed.

The last impression left in Zhao Xu's mind was the black dragon's approaching breath as he died.

With a sense of regret, Zhao Xu was reborn back in the classroom 10 years ago.

He was back to the moment when the game was launched.

No one, including the game development company, except for Zhao Xu, knew that Aria was an actual parallel world.

After crossing over, countless people regretted not playing this game in the first place.
Even the employees of the game development company, as long as they have not played the game in their spare time after a year, they are still considered as novices.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu woke up and quickly took out his phone to log in to the TC game store to pre-order this game.

"Arthur" as a paid pre-order game, is quite expensive. However, even after the game is launched, there are no additional paid items.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the pre-order packages in the store.

Arthur Standard Edition, 299 RMB.
Arthur Deluxe Edition, 599 RMB.

The standard edition goes without saying, in fact, most players buy the standard edition. The deluxe edition includes an extra set of clothing for the player, essentially paying 300 RMB for a skin, and the bonus clothing does not improve any combat power.

But Zhao Xu's focus was not on this. A year later, the earth will be destroyed, and all the wealth will turn to ashes. At this point, paying an extra 300 RMB for a piece of clothing from another world is simply a windfall, only a fool wouldn't exchange it.

Without hesitation, Zhao Xu clicked on the pre-order interface for the deluxe edition. However, just as he was about to undergo iris verification to make the payment, his whole body suddenly shook.

He remembered something. Many years ago, he once came into contact with a high-level player and heard a legend from the envy in the other person's expression.

In this game, there are dual elites, meaning dual professions. Dual professions allow players to simultaneously have two parallel career paths without adding levels together.

If a regular player is a level 3 warrior and a level 7 mage, then he is a level 10 character.
Here is the translation:

For dual-profession players, when they reach level 10, they can choose to become a level 10 mage or a level 10 priest on one career path, and a level 10 mage or a level 10 priest on another career path. Essentially, they are still level 10 characters, but they have the abilities of two level 10 careers. They still have the same life value, attack power, and expertise as before, but they have acquired additional resources from another career path. This allows them to become top players in the game.

According to a certain big shot, dual-profession careers are actually a system that will be fully open in the future, serving as an upgrade to a certain version of the game. The system was initially tested with a small number of accounts to test its intensity and make adjustments. As a test account, its greatest advantage is that it allows players to experience the game for free. However, the cost is that the account will be reclaimed after a year.

This move is also intended to prevent imbalance among players, as these test accounts will be reclaimed after a year. Even players who participated in the test and witnessed the growing popularity of the game simply gave up their reclaimed accounts and purchased the game again.

What no one knew was that before the accounts were reclaimed, the entire community suddenly crossed over and became real characters in the game, and it was impossible to reclaim them. The one-year period was thus extended to permanent.

These accounts are also a batch of privileged accounts in the Arthurian world, and according to the big shot, very few test accounts persisted until the late period. However, as long as these account holders survived and entered the real Arthurian world, they all became top-notch players.
Thinking of this, Zhao Xu stood up directly, turned around and prepared to walk out of the classroom door. If he waited a few more minutes for the bell to ring, it would be too late for him to run.

"Hey, Xu ge, last time in the Marxist-Leninist class, Lao Huang said he would take attendance. You're really asking for trouble," his roommate Zhang Qi quickly called out to him.

Zhao Xu didn't even bring his textbook, just waved his hand and said, "I have something to do first."

Before he finished speaking, his figure flashed out the door, just as some students were coming into the classroom for class.

After turning out the door, Zhao Xu found a flower bed nearby and sat down. He immediately picked up his phone and called the TC game customer service to inquire about the test account for Double Elite.

Before he could talk for a few minutes on the phone, Zhao Xu's face slowly became serious.

He hadn't even tried to persuade them, but the customer service politely and formally refused him.

The other party stated that the distribution of test accounts had been completed half a month ago.

Those participating in the test were invited players, and the test was not planned to be open to the general public in the short term.

In other words, he had no chance, and it was pointless to keep thinking about it.

Thinking about it, even if he got a test account for Double Elite, at best it was just a free trial, and he would still be stronger than regular players.

If it were open to everyone, everyone would have an account to experience, and there wouldn't be a 2-hour time limit for refund services.

This response made Zhao Xu frown.

He was well aware that he was not a high-level player.

He had only started playing the game seven or eight months after it launched, and even though he didn't play much, it was still under the guidance of experienced players and with a mature leveling route. Despite this, it took him four months to reach level 2.

This was the most precious year in the virtual world.

After entering the real world of Arthur, everyone's leveling speed had slowed down significantly.

It's not an exaggeration to say that one year in the game is equivalent to ten years in the real world.
Zhao Xu also adheres to the concept of revenge. He has narrowly escaped death several times and has even overdrawn his future life span in order to barely reach level 5. Otherwise, following his ordinary trajectory of life, it's possible that he would only be at level 3 or 4 after 10 years.

If it weren't for the blessing of his dual elite account, even with 10 years of experience, he would only be in the first tier of players.

Encountering the black dragon from his past life, who killed him as easily as killing a chicken, would be a problem.

He must reach a high enough level to have the ability to protect his family.

After calming down slightly, Zhao Xu immediately opened the X Fish platform.

On X Fish, in addition to being able to sell second-hand items, many people have also been selling various services and even brand new products. They can also request to buy certain goods.

Zhao Xu directly stated that he was looking to purchase a one-year dual elite test account for "Arthur."

When it came time to fill in the price, he didn't want to negotiate, so he just filled in the game's price of 599.

This meant that the other person would be exchanging a one-year test account for a permanent deluxe private account, with the only difference being that they wouldn't be able to experience the features of the dual elite account.

Currently, there are not only dual elite test accounts, but also many other types of test accounts that are no different from regular accounts.

So he specifically requested a one-year dual elite test account, which is the longest-lasting test account.

Sure enough, after Zhao Xu posted his request, someone immediately sent him a private message, taking into account his good credit score.

"Do you want a six-month test account for a powerful race?"

Zhao Xu naturally knew about the powerful race, which was actually a late-game feature that everyone knew about.

The feature of the powerful race is that they provide more abilities, and it's not unusual for characters to reach level four or five. This can help new players bridge the gap with older players.
Arthur's biggest selling point is the global cross-server. However, an account reclaimed six months later has no meaning. The duration of the account is not based on the activation time, but on the opening time of the server. Otherwise, he could reclaim it and give it to his friends to use. After Zhao Xu refused, several private messages came in. There were even 24-hour test accounts for 10 yuan. Zhao Xu didn't even bother to reply, and just moved on to the next message. "Brother, do you want a six-month double elite test account? 299 is fine for you." After Zhao Xu accidentally clicked on a message, he was initially happy to see the words "double elite," but when the six-month period appeared, he felt disappointed. There are even six-month double elite accounts. "This price is very cost-effective. Even experienced players like you can't get this invitation account. Mine is considered long for six months, many are only three months." Seeing the other person's reply, Zhao Xu, although not interested, still patiently tried to gather information from the other person. The other person sells for 299, actually because the strength of the double elite account is only evident in the later stages. The shorter the time, the lower the level, and it cannot truly reflect the strength of the double elite profession. If it can last for three or four years, covering the entire lifecycle of a game, then large guilds are willing to invest tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands in these accounts. After some communication, the other person felt that Zhao Xu didn't want to buy, and his replies became less and less frequent. So, until the evening, half an hour before the opening of the server at 8 o'clock, Zhao Xu had not received a one-year double elite test account. According to the current information, it seems that there are far fewer double elite test accounts than he had imagined.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's phone vibrated, indicating that he had a private chat from an x fish user.

"I have a dual elite system account for one year, along with the潜能点 test results."

潜能点? Zhao Xu's expression froze, as he had never heard of this ability before. However, he didn't care, as long as he had the dual elite system.

As he looked at the opponent's message, he realized it was an implicit suggestion to pay more money.

In actuality, no matter how much money was involved, he would find a way to convince his parents to lend him the money.

This wasn't buying a game account; it was buying his life.

"How much?" Zhao Xu didn't immediately reveal his price.

"1000." The opponent directly doubled Zhao Xu's desired price.

"You're being too outrageous," Zhao Xu quickly typed back.

Although he had already felt an overwhelming sense of excitement in his heart, he still tried to negotiate the price.

Agreeing too easily would only make the other party suspect that he was selling at a low price and might cause trouble.

After some haggling, the final price was 800. The process exhausted Zhao Xu's body and mind, like solving a math problem.

After the opponent agreed, Zhao Xu asked him to post the item on x fish using his title and then paid the payment immediately.

The entire process went smoothly without any unexpected events.

As he looked at the game activation code sent by the opponent, Zhao Xu, even at his advanced age of over thirty, couldn't help but feel thrilled.

The code was a simple sequence of numbers, but it was the key to his future.
