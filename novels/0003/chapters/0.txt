Chapter 001 Return to the Past
"Hey, hey, did you pre-order 'Arthur'?"
"Of course, I pre-ordered it six months ago."
"The game is said to be fully AI-managed, with players leading the world line. Everyone says it's the most free game ever."
"I saw the simulation footage in the trailer before, and the VR felt super realistic."
"Didn't they say you can play for more than 4 hours while sleeping? The longest I've played is only 3 hours."
"It's going online tonight, hurry up and invite me, you guys."
Zhao Xu looked blankly at the enthusiastic discussion of his college classmates.
The faces of these youthful years in front of him are all memories from 10 years ago.
This scene seemed familiar.
His heart tightened, and countless memories scattered like flying cotton in his mind.
10 years ago, 'Arthur' opened today.
Unnoticed, the curtain of the new era was quietly drawn on this day, ushering in a real great era.
On the first anniversary of Arthur's opening, the earth was suddenly struck by a devastating meteor shower, and all life turned to ashes.
However, humans found themselves crossing over to the world of Arthur after the meteor shower.
Former Arthur players perfectly inherited everything from the game.
The upper-level players in the game became the elite of the earth in Arthur's world, and the original forces on earth were reshuffled.
In his previous life, Zhao Xu didn't care about this game. It wasn't until almost eight months after it opened that his classmates forcibly dragged him into it, just to join their class's guild.
He only logs in to the game every three days, and just reached level 2 before the crossover. Meanwhile, most players who entered the game from the beginning are already close to level 5, with some advanced players even surpassing level 10. Zhao Xu, who joined the game late, is only at level 2. However, as one of the lucky few who played the game before the crossover, he undoubtedly belongs to the upper echelons of Earth's power. In the world of Arthur, with the help of his classmates and his professional level, Zhao Xu quickly provided a decent living for his family. Unfortunately, his luck ran out when his town was attacked by a sudden black dragon three years after the crossover. His entire family perished in the crisis, including his newlywed wife. From that moment on, Zhao Xu's life lost all color. He narrowly escaped being conscripted by the lord, but was burdened with the shackles of revenge. For the next six years, he worked tirelessly for vengeance. Eventually, he joined an adventure team to hunt down the black dragon, but the team was ambushed before they could enter the dragon's lair. The last thing Zhao Xu remembered was the dragon's breath coming towards him. With the regret of death, Zhao Xu was reborn in the classroom ten years earlier. He returned to the moment just before the game was launched. The entire world, including the game development company, had no knowledge that Arthur was actually a real parallel universe. After the crossover, countless people regretted not playing the game earlier.
Even the employees of the game development company, as long as they have not played the game in their spare time, will still be novices after a year.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu woke up and quickly took out his phone to log in to TC's game mall and pre-order this game.

"Arthur" as a paid pre-order game, is quite expensive. However, even after the game is launched, there are no additional paid items available.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the pre-order packages in the mall. 

Arthur Standard Edition, 299rmb. 
Arthur Deluxe Edition, 599rmb. 

Naturally, most players purchase the standard edition. The deluxe edition includes an extra set of clothing for the player, essentially paying 300rmb for a skin, as the clothing does not improve any combat capabilities.

But Zhao Xu's focus was not on this. A year later, the earth will be destroyed, and all the wealth will turn to ashes. At this time, spending an additional 300rmb to get a piece of clothing from another world is like a gift from the heavens, only a fool would not change.

Without hesitation, Zhao Xu directly clicked on the pre-order interface for the deluxe edition. However, just as he was about to undergo iris verification to make the payment, he suddenly shook.

He remembered something. Many years later, he had once encountered a high-level player, and from the envy in the other person's eyes, he heard a legend.

In this game, there exist dual elites, also known as dual professions. Dual professions allow players to simultaneously have two parallel career paths, with their levels not stacking. If an ordinary player is a level 3 warrior and a level 7 mage, then he is a level 10 character.
Here is the translation:

For dual-profession players, when they reach level 10, they can choose between level 10 mage and level 10 priest. Essentially, they are still level 10 characters, but they possess the abilities of two level 10 professions. They still have the same life value, attack power, and expertise as level 10 characters. However, they have an additional career path with additional resources, which allows them to become the best players in the game.

According to the senior, dual-profession is a system that will be fully opened in the future, as a version upgrade to attract players. When the game is launched, only a limited number of accounts are opened for testing dual-profession mode, which is to test the intensity and make adjustments later. As a testing account, the biggest advantage is that it allows players to experience the game for free. However, the account will be reclaimed after a year.

This is also to prevent large-scale players from becoming unbalanced, as a reclaimed account will not be able to be recovered even if it is strong. Many players who participated in the test even gave up their reclaimed accounts and purchased the game again. However, no one knows that before the account is reclaimed, a strange phenomenon occurred, and players' characters became permanent.

These accounts are the only special batch of privileged accounts in the Arthur world. According to the senior, the number of testing accounts that persisted to the later period is extremely small. However, as long as they survive until the real Arthur world, the owners of these accounts are all powerful players.
Thinking of this, Zhao Xu stood up directly, turned and prepared to walk out of the classroom door. If he waited a few more minutes for the bell to ring, it would be hard for him to leave.

"Hey, Xu Ge, the last time we had this Marxist-Leninist class, the teacher said he was going to take attendance. Are you trying to get in trouble?" his roommate Zhang Qi hurriedly called out to him.

Zhao Xu didn't even bring his textbook, he just waved his hand and said, "I have something to take care of first."

Before he could finish speaking, he dashed out, just as a few students who were coming to class were passing by.

After he left the classroom, Zhao Xu found a flowerbed nearby and sat down. He immediately picked up his phone and called the customer service for TC's game, inquiring about the test account for Double Elite.

After only a few words on the phone, Zhao Xu's face slowly became serious.

Before he could even try to persuade them, the customer service politely and formally refused him.

They said that the distribution of test accounts had been completed half a month ago.

The participants in the test were all invited players, and the test was not planned to be open to the general public in the short term.

In short, he had no chance, and shouldn't think about it anymore.

He thought about it. Even if he got a test account for Double Elite, at best it would be a free trial, and he would still be weaker than regular players.

If it were open to everyone, everyone would have an account to try out, and they wouldn't be limited by the 2-hour refund policy.

This response made Zhao Xu frown.

He knew very well that he wasn't a high-level player.

He had only started playing the game seven or eight months after it was released, and even though he didn't play much, he only reached level 2 after four months, thanks to the mature leveling strategies and guidance from others. This was a precious year in the virtual world.

Once he entered the real world of Arthur, everyone's leveling speed slowed down significantly.

It's not an exaggeration to say that one year in the game is equivalent to ten years in real life.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also adhered to the concept of revenge, risking his life multiple times and exhausting his future lifespan to barely reach level 5. If he hadn't had his dual elite account, even with 10 years of experience, he would have barely made it to the top 10% of players. Moreover, he would have had to face the black dragon that had killed him like a chicken in his past life.

He had to have enough level to protect his family. After calming down a bit, Zhao Xu immediately opened the Xyu platform.

On Xyu, besides releasing his own second-hand goods, many people also sold various services and new products, and even bought some goods. Zhao Xu directly specified that he wanted to buy a one-year dual elite account for "Arthur".

When filling in the price, he didn't say a word, and directly filled in the game price of 599.

It was equivalent to exchanging a one-year test account for a permanent luxurious private account, with only one difference: it couldn't experience the features of dual elite accounts. The test account now had many types, including ones that were no different from ordinary accounts. Therefore, he specifically emphasized wanting a one-year dual elite test account, which was also the longest-lasting test account.

As expected, after Zhao Xu published his post, private messages poured in. "Do you want a strong breed test account for half a year?"

Zhao Xu naturally knew that the strong breed was actually a known late-stage open content. The strong breed's feature was that it provided more abilities, and even top-level players with levels of four or five were not unusual, allowing new players to catch up with old players.
One of Arthur's major selling points is the global server. However, the account he took back six months later was meaningless. The duration of the account is not based on the activation time, but on the opening time of the server. Otherwise, he could take it back and give it to his friends to use. After Zhao Xu refused, several private messages came in. Even the 10 yuan 24-hour test account, Zhao Xu didn't even bother to reply, and just moved on to the next message. "Brother, do you want a half-year double elite test account? I'll sell it to you for 299." After Zhao Xu accidentally clicked on a message and saw the words "double elite," he felt happy, but when he saw "half-year," he felt disappointed. There are even half-year double elite accounts. "This price is very cost-effective. If you're not a senior player, you won't be able to get this invitation account. My half-year period is considered long, many are only three months." Seeing the other party's reply, Zhao Xu, although not wanting to buy, still patiently tried to gather information from the other party. The other party sells for 299, actually because the strength of the double elite account is only evident in the later stages. The shorter the time, the lower the level, and it cannot truly reflect the strength of the double elite profession. If it can last for three to four years, covering the entire lifecycle of a game, then large guilds are willing to invest tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands in this type of account. After some communication, the other party felt that Zhao Xu also didn't want to buy, and replied with only a few words. So, until the evening, half an hour before the opening of the server at eight o'clock, Zhao Xu had not received a one-year double elite test account. According to the current information, it seems that there are far fewer double elite test accounts than he had imagined.
Here's the translation:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's phone vibrated, indicating that an X game user was privately chatting with him.

"I'm holding an elite system account that's valid for a year, along with a potential point test."

Potential point? Zhao Xu froze, as he had never heard of this ability before. However, he didn't care, as having an elite system was enough.

As he read the opponent's message, he realized it was actually a hint to add money.

In reality, Zhao Xu would buy it regardless of the price, even if it cost tens of thousands of yuan. He would persuade his parents to lend him the money.

"This isn't buying a game account; it's buying his life."

Zhao Xu didn't immediately give his price. "1000," the opponent directly doubled Zhao Xu's demand.

"You're being too exaggerated," Zhao Xu quickly typed back.

Although he was already overflowing with joy inside, he still tried to negotiate the price.

If he agreed too easily, the opponent would likely suspect that he was selling cheaply and cause trouble.

Zhao Xu pretended to cut the price and didn't dare to actually cut it too much, fearing that the opponent would ignore him.

After several rounds of negotiation, they finally settled on a price of 800 yuan. The process left Zhao Xu physically and mentally exhausted.

After the opponent agreed, Zhao Xu instructed him to post the product on X game according to the platform's process, then paid immediately.

The entire process was smooth, with no unexpected twists.

As he looked at the game activation code sent by the opponent, Zhao Xu, even though his mental age was already over thirty, couldn't help but feel excited.

The activation code, a simple sequence of numbers, was his future.
