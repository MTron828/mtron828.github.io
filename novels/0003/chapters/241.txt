Chapter 242: Spell Combination

The giant of dark arts stabbed Zhao Xu with a sword, with a force exceeding a thousand catties!
But the sword's momentum was like a wave that never receded, and it kept coming.

Just a few seconds later, the opponent launched a flurry of four consecutive attacks on Zhao Xu, each one striking him directly.

Like a tide of waves, each sword stroke struck Zhao Xu's body, with the last one still strong enough to crush the opponent.

The onlookers were left staring in awe, and this was the first time they had seen this monster unleash its legendary "rapid strike"!

Saint Warrior saw Zhao Xu's unyielding determination and felt a mix of bitterness and disappointment, lamenting his own powerlessness and the opponent's impending doom.

For warriors, saint warriors, barbarians, and rangers, the key to leveling up is to master the next level of attack depth.

These four major combat classes are the benchmarks for physical output, and the number of levels determines the number of attack depths they possess!

Ordinary people usually exhaust their sword momentum after a single strike, making it difficult to launch another attack in a short time.
However, once they reach the 6th level, they can master the "rapid strike" technique, unleashing a two-strike combo in a single attack.

Although the second strike's attack power is significantly reduced, the first strike has a 6th-level power, and the second strike falls to around 1st level. This is an ability that few combat classes can maintain in the mid-to-late stages.
Here is the translation of the text:

When attacking simultaneously reaches the 11th level, it will trigger the "Three-Strike" ability, and when attacking reaches the 16th level, it will trigger the "Four-Strike" ability. From then on, the seal is complete, and it's impossible to swing a sword weighing seven or eight catties with both hands, thrusting out ten swords filled with power and capable of breaking through defenses.

The "Evil Giant" in front of us is a 18th-level warrior with a natural talent for attacking, directly comparable to an 18th-level warrior. Naturally, the "Four-Strike" technique is no exception.

Moreover, although the opponent's basic attack level is only 18, with the 42-point blessing of the Evil Giant's own power, its own attack power directly soars to above 30 levels. Even the weakest strike in the sequence has a power above 18 levels.

This is also the reason why everyone feels hopeless about Zhao Xu.

Everyone has undergone swordsmanship training, and the basic attack power is not necessarily visible, but by looking at the attack power of a single sword, one can judge it to be about 80-90% accurate.

However, unexpectedly, when the four swords are applied to Zhao Xu, the sword that is even higher than Zhao Xu's height fails to penetrate his body, which is less than two meters tall.

Zhao Xu's cloak flashes four times, emitting a blinding flash of light, and then he simply jumps to the rear, about half a meter away.

At the same time, the four dull sounds come from the position where Zhao Xu originally stood.

It seems that the four swords have just struck the copper wall and iron shield.

Zhao Xu only slightly relaxed his breath, canceling the emergency spell he was about to release.

Just then, he verified that the "Star-Cloth Cloak" is effective against magical weapons.

From the moment Zhao Xu obtained the Star-Cloth Cloak, he knew that he had already become fearless against ordinary weapons.
Here is the translation:

As for magical weapons, the Starry Cloak will intercept the incoming attacks and convert them into an impact on itself. As long as he can successfully dodge, he will only take half the damage. Most importantly, regardless of the opponent's high attack threat, the Cloak will convert it into a roughly 15-level difficulty reflectability. Even dodging a 5th-level mage's "Fireball" spell requires a difficulty level greater than 15. The Cloak had just converted the four consecutive attacks on Zhao Xu's body into four shockwaves. No one on the scene could see what was happening, but Zhao Xu knew he had already undergone a test of continuous four-reflection dodges while leaping to the rear. If he failed once, he would take the full damage of the heavy sword. When the first sword of the giant mage Tiāo fell, he had already realized that Zhao Xu's Cloak was as hard as steel. However, the arrow was already on the bowstring, and he would finish his attack sequence before speaking. But the result was still beyond his expectations. The giant mage Tiāo immediately understood what had happened and muttered to himself, "The Starry Cloak, a seven-ring spell, can only dodge half the damage from magical weapons." The giant mage Tiāo did not make another move, but instead thought deeply on the battlefield, as if this was a truth worth pursuing. Through the flash of light that fell like a meteor, he recognized the corresponding spell, but it didn't match his memories. "How did you do it? You didn't take any damage at all?" he wondered, looking at Zhao Xu. Zhao Xu naturally smiled without speaking.
Here is the translation of the text:

Generally speaking, monsters are not as powerful as the Fiendish Servant, born with a "+5 Dance in the Sky" giant sword and a "+2 Instant Kill Compound Longbow".

These two weapons are "+10" value super-large weapons, and picking up either one is worth over 200,000 gold.

As a result, many monsters have been unable to defeat Zhao Xu (the protagonist) before, unless they have the gift of reducing magical damage taken.

It was only the Fearful Binding Spirit, which had a "+1 Underworld" giant scythe, that was Zhao Xu's first encounter with a monster that came with magical weapons.

However, the outcome was self-evident, and Zhao Xu ended up equipping himself with the magical weapons.

When a monster has magical weapons, its own danger level will increase dramatically.

To others, this is the same.

Holding a broken weapon worth a few gold coins is of no interest to anyone, but holding a magical weapon worth tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of gold coins is a declaration to the world: "Come and take my equipment!"

Undead creatures and elementals are extremely hated because, when killed, they usually yield no loot, except for some gray ash used as spell materials.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was able to completely dodge the giant's attacks.

This is the reason why the "Star Cloak" was placed in the first treasury by the Emperor Ernest - it can be combined with the spell "Legacy Explorer's Fortune", which allows the caster to sustain spells.

With the blessing of the spell, Zhao Xu obtained the "Evasion" ability of a 2nd-level Acrobat.

For those who originally received only half the damage from a successful evasive maneuver, Zhao Xu, with this ability, could evade attacks and receive no damage at all.

In addition, the spell also gave him a "+7 Luck" bonus equal to his Charisma adjustment value, which was already higher than 7 due to his stacking.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's reflex evasion value has been added to the stacking effect of the two skills, exceeding 14 levels. In other words, his reflex evasion ability is strong enough, even if he performs poorly, it's unlikely to fail. With the effect of the "pick destiny" skill, he can see two results each time he uses reflex evasion and can implement the better one.

He's equivalent to being able to take two final exams and choose the better result. His probability of failing reflex evasion is only 5%, making it almost impossible for him to take damage.

Normally, Zhao Xu's reflex evasion failure rate is less than 1/300, making it difficult for him to take damage. Even in this state, he will still have a way to counterattack.

This is based on Zhao Xu just abandoning his defense and relying solely on his Starlight Cloak. If an ordinary person attacked him, they might not even be able to break through his basic defense, let alone trigger the damage of his cloak.

Later, after Zhao Xu tries to stack his defensive power, his physical defense will become as solid as a fortress.

At that time, it will be a pure magical battle. In the instant Zhao Xu thought, his spellcasting action did not slow down at all, and he had already seen that the giant mage on the other side was about to cast "Higher Dispelling Magic".

The opponent's thinking is correct, and he won't remove the "Legacy of the Treasure Hunter" skill from Zhao Xu's body, making it impossible for the giant mage Tazio to deal damage to him smoothly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu has just discovered the "Demonic Giant" and its magical abilities, including:

* Instantaneous Dispel Magic (6th circle)
* Magic Missile (1st circle)
* Nullification of Magic (6th circle)

The "Random Door" (4th circle) can be used three times a day.

Zhao Xu is also under the effect of "Magic Endurance" and has a shield on him, making him completely immune to Magic Missile.

Unless the "Demonic Giant" uses its Instantaneous Dispel Magic or produces another magical item, Zhao Xu is not afraid of the giant at all.

At this moment, Zhao Xu has completed his first swift action:

* "Classical Magic Ability Instant Release: Prayer."

The simulation is an 8th circle divine magic "Higher Integration."

The integration is the first: the Hammer of Justice.

The integration is the second: the Supreme Effect of Justice.

The second standard action is:

* "Classical Magic Ability: Command."

Zhao Xu has compressed five magical spells in one turn and has released this set of spells.

In reality, each player typically uses only one spell per turn.

Suddenly, two force fields collide, forming a devastating attack that is directly aimed at the Demonic Giant.

The massive damage enters the giant's body and directly tears at his torso. The giant suddenly realizes the danger and is about to use the Random Door to escape.

However, Zhao Xu's two simple words "Command" have already entered the Demonic Giant's ears.

It's as if the morning bell and evening drum are striking, directly striking at his heart.

"Crash!" The heavy sword falls to the ground, stirring up endless dust.

The Demonic Giant Taoli has become a statue, unable to make any further movements.
