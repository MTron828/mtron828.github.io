Chapter 642: The Secret of the God of Death

"What's going on? The sky is suddenly darkening again?"

"Hurry up and retreat, take shelter from the rain!"

The countless civilians in the wilderness, seeing this scene, all showed panic on their faces, and no one could imagine how the heavy rain that had finally stopped would suddenly resume.

At this time, only the camps with enough players could mobilize enough labor to build houses. Otherwise, most people were still struggling to survive and obtain food.

Suddenly, the rainclouds looming above seemed to be about to pour down, and the earth was flooded. The countless earthlings who had crossed over were shocked, and they were thinking about how to solve the problem.

Even a single banana leaf that could slightly block the rain became a highly sought-after precious resource.

The makeshift houses that had not been built yet began to leak when the rain came, and those that had been built were too flimsy to withstand the rain. Unless a player had a high-ranking family member, they were not even qualified to live in them, and the roofs were even broken.

More powerless civilians could only tightly pack the second cotton shirt given to them by Zhao Xuan, along with the waterproof oilcloth, and wait for the rain to pass before changing.

In this desolate wilderness, a simple cold could take away a fresh life.

At this moment, even players busy rescuing and high-level priests from the rescue team couldn't understand what was happening above the sky - this heavy rain that was about to fall, seemingly unrelated to any divine prophecy.
The players who were hunting in the wild suddenly found that the "undead creatures" such as skeleton soldiers and zombies, which were originally fierce and had not had time to escape back to the caves, suddenly fell into a precarious situation.
It's as if they had lost their most fundamental strength.
Meanwhile, in the mysterious cave underground, Zhao Xu was silently watching the front, where a dazzling starlight was constantly emanating, surrounded by a divine light like a condensed star diamond - the godly aura of death.
The last time he had direct contact with it, he was instantly killed by a semi-god mummy.
This time, some of the contents of the amber stone coffin, combined with the parts originally possessed by the artificial death god, suddenly emitted a more radiant light.
The colorful glassy colors, so bright that people couldn't look away, also made all the legendary undead creatures around him kneel on the ground, showing their submission to him.
Arthur's legendary undead creatures are also divided into several levels, just like demons have different ranks.
The "lava evil spirits" and "frosty corpse demons" in front of them are more submissive to more powerful legendary undead creatures, such as the semi-god witch and the godly withered.
Therefore, their natural ambition is also the lowest, and their first reaction is to submit to Zhao Xu.
"Zhong Xia, now almost half of the godly aura of death belongs to you." The heavenly man finally let out a sigh of relief and finally showed a tired tone.
"Don't underestimate it."
"Oh?" Zhao Xu was slightly surprised, but he didn't reach out to touch it.
Knowledge about gods is ultimately too mysterious, not within the scope of the knowledge system. Religious knowledge can occasionally be seen, but it mostly relies on careful consideration and speculation to glimpse the truth in the historical fog.
"The divinity of this power, even if given to an ordinary person, could turn them into a demigod on the spot. If a legendary strongman were able to successfully digest the power of divinity, it is not impossible for them to possess a weak divine power."

"So the opportunity is right in front of you now, do you want to give it a try?"

Although the voice of the person speaking sounded tempting, Zhao Xu remained calm, not showing any hint of evil even when looking at the "star-like" divinity.

If they were a team of adventurers at this moment, they would surely be unable to resist the temptation and would act recklessly.

It's not about moral corruption or lack of self-control.

It's just that the opportunity to become a god is simply too tempting!

This kind of temptation is irresistible to anyone with a normal sense of reason.

Even for Zhao Xu at the moment, the chance to become a true "death god" was a rare and extremely precious opportunity.

With a gentle gaze, Zhao Xu continued to observe the divinity in front of him, but he never made a move.

"What's wrong?" the person asked, surprised.

"Do you not know the power of divinity? Or should I explain to you the immortality of transcendent divine power?"

"Such as the legendary 'taking of life and giving of death'!"

"This transcendent divine power can penetrate the boundaries of dimensions and even break through all protective barriers outside of the 'divine power shield'. Even if the opponent cannot be sensed, just by relying on detailed descriptions of characteristics such as what they have done, it can enable the killing or resurrection of a mortal being."

"Except for the effects of the 'gift of life' or the 'taking of life and giving of death' performed by higher-level divine beings. There are even more terrifying abilities, such as the 'area taking of life and giving of death', which can take away any number of lives or perform resurrections."
"The relevant elements of killing and seizing life are the divine professions of 'death' or 'supremacy.' Only the gods of death use this method and do not need to rest. Even you know why I can easily manipulate the undead creatures in the cave depths? The extraordinary divine power related to the profession of death is beyond your imagination. The human paradise at this time clearly saw that Zhao Xu did not have the desire to become a god of death, so he chose to cooperate with him. Who knows, looking at Zhao Xu's carefree appearance, he instead felt a bit resentful, and immediately listed the strengths of the profession of death. No matter how powerful Arthur's divine power is, the god of death is always an indelible part. The profession implies having the highest dominance in the corresponding field. Life, old age, sickness, and death are the destiny that every creature in Arthur cannot escape, even if they become gods. So any creature in Arthur cannot escape the gaze of the god of death. 'No, I know everything you said,' Zhao Xu shook his head. 'In the land of the sleepers, I passed the trial of the former god of slaughter and activated three opportunities to use extraordinary divine power from its legacy statue. Otherwise, I would not have been able to approach the amber stone coffin and seize the divine fragment.' 'In that case, how can you remain so calm at this moment?' 'This is the divine fragment? It's much more precious than you becoming a legendary mage on the spot!' The human paradise was even more excited at this point. 'I can even guarantee that all the countless gifts from fate you have received since entering Arthur cannot compare to this piece in front of you, which can make you a demigod or even a weak god.'"
Here is the translation:

"Even with the 'friendship' you and the magical goddess have in the depths of the underworld, you can become a middle-ranking god by borrowing her power, and it's not a difficult task."

However, without realizing it, as the personification of the heavenly paradise became more generous and enthusiastic, Zhao Xu's expression remained calm and indifferent.

"If the gods were truly eternal, the god of death would not have died, and even his later successors, who have all fallen one by one, would not have numbered in the thousands over the past thousand years."

"A cautious legendary mage may not have even mastered the legendary magic in a thousand years," Zhao Xu said.

"What's your reason?" the personification of the heavenly paradise seemed to read Zhao Xu's intentions, "It sounds reasonable, but it's definitely not the real reason you're refusing."

"Can you tell me?" Zhao Xu just kept smiling, without saying a word.

And then, there was actually a—

Saintly Catastrophe!
Within a hundred years, it would inevitably happen. What was the point of rushing through this mess within this hundred-year period?

At that time, the gods would fall to the mortal world, losing all their divine power, and could only rely on their own professional abilities, although most of them were legendary strongmen with levels of three or four decades. However, they would not be able to withstand the pressure of bearing the divine aura and the target was too big.

Zhao Xu would not choose to become a god within a hundred years.

"Ah, well," the personification of the heavenly paradise sighed, "I just finished rebuilding myself and was about to fall asleep. I'm curious, but there's no need to continue lying in this mess. You didn't say anything, but I could sense a catastrophe about the gods was about to arrive."

"And I'll tell you the true secret of the god of death's aura."

As the personification of the heavenly paradise spoke, it revealed a voice of utmost seriousness for the first time, "This is the true secret of why the god of death died."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Also included are the reasons why subsequent generations of successors were unable to become true gods of death, as well as the causes of artificial gods of death."

"Are you prepared to take on this responsibility?"

"Just knowing is impossible to escape this fate. If you don't want to inherit this divine authority, I don't need to drag you into it. You can just pass it on to the magic goddess or Anzetta, and they will naturally have a reasonable way to resolve the issue."

Zhao Xu, however, was tightly grasping the "Human Haven" in his hand, which had transformed back into a long sword, and was transmitting his firm conviction to himself.

He didn't want to become a god of death, but that didn't mean he couldn't let someone else inherit the opportunity.

For him, getting entangled in a fate that couldn't be escaped might not be worth it.

However, for many people, if they despise the divine authority due to the "Saint's Calamity," it's not unlike a joke about not eating meat.

But he really wanted to give someone the authority, so he had to clarify the entire cause-and-effect of the divine authority before making a true decision.

"That's it, the next chapter of history I've been waiting for, finally someone to talk to."

As he spoke, the Human Haven slowly transmitted its years of experience to him.

"I can tell you that the 'death' of Death God Nala itself is a game!"

"including artificial gods of death, various divine fragments, and various gods devouring death, all of which are a huge 'checkmate' set up by Death God Nala before his death."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but catch his breath.

"This is actually a sign revealed in the prophecies of the seven main gods."

When Zhao Xu heard this, his heart rate increased slightly.
"Those who are aware of the prophecy know that the god of death is one of the seven major gods, but the chosen one for the final god of death is not Hades, but—"
"But what?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.
"A female, I don't know the specifics. Because the prophecy of the seven major gods does not specify who it is, it leaves a vague space for fate, so many people could become the god of death and it does not point to a single target."
"But one thing is certain, the future god of death will be a woman."
At this point, Zhao Xu also realized, "So when Hades realized that he was not the final god of death, but in the situation where the death of the god of death represents the eternal destiny, he took special measures?"
"That's right," Ren Dao Tian said seriously, "From the artificial god of death, the god of slaughter, to the few death-related gods that emerged later, all of them were part of the 'mist' laid down by the original god of death, Hades."
"Used to conceal his true resurrection plan."
"Can the fate of the god of death really be broken, and can he be resurrected?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.
"I'm not sure of the specific plan, because I only learned about these secrets by following him. And because I knew too much, he arranged for me to be sealed in the depths of this mysterious cave."
"The true purpose of the one hundred demon king devices buried in this mysterious cave is to deal with the gods!"
"The original intention was to prevent a powerful deity from retrieving a part of their consciousness. This last resort left behind by the Emperor Ernesto ensures that even the death god Nalaku can rest assured. In other words, if you were to greedily absorb this divine fragment directly into your being, the demonic king's device underground would launch a full-scale attack on you, leading to your immediate demise."

"How was it able to come alive then?" Zhao Xu pointed to the artificial death god body lying on the ground.

"Because it is not a true deity," the artificial heaven said sarcastically, "you really think you've killed a demigod, don't you?"

"There is one crucial rule, that ordinary weapons and magic cannot truly harm a deity."

"You don't count as an ordinary weapon, do you?" Zhao Xu pointed out.

"After I was reforged, I became an ordinary weapon, otherwise how could I trust you to take me out? And I didn't return to being ordinary, how could I transcend reincarnation?" the artificial heaven said, rolling its eyes.

"Then continue, what is the death god's plan?"

"I told you, I'm not sure, I only know that there are two artifacts that are the key to the death god's resurrection. Whoever wears them will lose their own consciousness and become a true death god, allowing Nalaku to return. And Nalaku has definitely chosen a female target to fulfill the final prophecy."

"So, when I had the thought of becoming a death god just now, I didn't actually have a chance," Zhao Xu realized.

A female, is the final hurdle.
Even the mighty death gods have fallen at this step.

"That's right, but fortunately you passed the test just now. The two artifacts are the eye and the arm."
