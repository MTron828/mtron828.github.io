Chapter 170: Mechanism of Human Shield

As time passed, the concentration of magical energy in the air gradually increased.

The "secret visual" that was always present on Anzhenia's body could only perceive the effects of formed spells.

However, with her legendary mage's keen senses, she had already felt the formation of a vortex of energy around Zhāo Xù, with him at its center, slowly gathering and accumulating.

The magical energy that flowed through Zhāo Xù's body after being processed and then resonated, ultimately falling on another important star position on the altar.

The star position was where Zhāo Xù's "Starlight Cloak" was placed.

There are two types of thinking when it comes to selecting ritual items.

One is the risk-spreading type, where various magical items have corresponding uses, so even if some are lost, the damage will not be catastrophic.

The other is the risk-concentrating type, where Zhāo Xù chose the "Starlight Cloak" as the item, which is an indispensable item in itself.

Zhāo Xù was fearless and continued to add to the cloak, making it the medium for the ritual.

This way, Zhāo Xù only needed to worry about the safety of this cloak in the future.

Many players even think that they can die, but they cannot part with their equipment.

Anzhenia breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the "Starlight Cloak" emitting a crystal-clear light.

She knew that Zhāo Xù had finally not caused any trouble this time.

After exhaling, Anzhenia's hand, which had been holding the "Time Reversal Amulet", relaxed.

Finally, the sand in the hourglass dripped and fell, then was turned over and started falling again, repeating this process four times.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's eyes slowly opened, and the "Stellar Cloak" in front of him also returned to its original state. Zhao Xu directly grabbed the cloak and put it on, feeling the mysterious powers emanating from it again.

【The adventurer Zhong Xia equips the Stellar Cloak, increasing the magic level by 1.】

Zhao Xu then released the Eien Stone, and he saw that his character panel showed that his magic level as an Arcane Mage was now 5, as a Cleric it was 3, and as a Monk it was 4. His magic levels had all increased by 2 due to the Eien Stone and the ritual.

This time, Zhao Xu's self-directed ritual had finally succeeded.

"Alright," Anniya said with a yawn, having sat for eight hours. She also looked a bit tired.

"That's all for now, Teacher," Zhao Xu estimated that it was almost 3-4 am. He needed to prepare his spells for the next day, but it wasn't too many.

He just needed to go to the location designated by Anniya to receive another magical item.

"Okay, wait a minute," Anniya said, walking in front of Zhao Xu.

"Stretch out your hand," she said.

Zhao Xu, who was used to Anniya's habits, followed her instructions and rolled up his sleeve.

"What pattern do you want?" Anniya asked.

"Any pattern," Zhao Xu replied.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, thinking that Anniya wouldn't actually draw a picture on his hand like a child.

Anniya then stretched out her white-tipped fingers and lightly touched Zhao Xu's arm.

Instantly, a warm current surged through him, and Zhao Xu felt a slight burning sensation mixed with numbness.

After finishing, Anniya turned around and left, leaving the whole process smooth and effortless.
Here is the translation:

At that moment, a small flower with six petals appeared on Zhao Xu's wrist, where people usually wear watches. This was a mark added by Anniya, a magical item she usually gave to her.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but rub his wrist gently, and to his surprise, the pattern had already penetrated deeply into his skin like a tattoo.

He thought to himself that if he showed this adorable flower to Aisvi, she would surely laugh to death. However, Zhao Xu quickly regained his composure and thought for a moment.

"Guess what I just did," he said. "If you can guess it correctly within 10 seconds, I can lend you this talisman for a while before you return."

As he spoke, Anniya removed the talisman from her chest and held it up for Zhao Xu to see. The talisman had a yellow copper chain and a narrow mouthed hourglass at the bottom, with a golden base on both ends.

However, Zhao Xu didn't have time to examine it further.

Anniya could wear it on her person, not in her bag. Its value was beyond his imagination, and he wouldn't dare underestimate it by a factor of ten.

But one thing was certain: it was powerful enough for Anniya to think it was useful.

As soon as Zhao Xu's flower appeared, he surveyed his entire body's state. Therefore, he didn't hesitate at all and immediately said, "Create a magical tattoo."

After hearing Zhao Xu's response, Anniya's eyes lit up, seemingly satisfied with his reaction.

Creating a magical tattoo was a second-level spell, with a limit of three tattoos on each person's body. The power of a tattoo had three levels, with eight varieties, depending on the caster's level.

Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xiu was looking at himself, who had become a 6-level mage, and realized that this was the strongest level of effect chosen by An Ti Nuo Ya.

In the past, Zhou Xiu had learned this spell in the final scroll space and had even cast it on himself.

However, the effect "Mage Level +1" requires a mage level of 13 or above. Although this is not a requirement for a 13-level mage, Zhou Xiu had never thought of using this spell to upgrade. Unexpectedly, An Ti Nuo Ya had just cast this spell on him.

However, An Ti Nuo Ya's question was not just about the name of the spell. Zhou Xiu quickly added, "Teacher, you used the 'supernatural skill' ability and combined it with the spell delay effect."

"Now I've made progress," Zhou Xiu said with a smile.

Zhou Xiu wiped the sweat from his forehead and noticed that the countdown time for this spell was 48 hours.

After the time was up, the tattoo would disappear, and the natural spell effect would disappear along with it.

The spellcasting time for creating a magic tattoo was 10 minutes, and the process of implementing the spell was the same as the process of tattooing. The duration of the spell was 24 hours.

Moreover, this spell required a tattoo needle and special ink materials. However, An Ti Nuo Ya had just pressed it lightly, taking only a few seconds to do so, without using any materials.

So Zhou Xiu suspected that the other party had used the same "supernatural skill" as when they used the prayer spell.
Here is the translation:

This ability allows one to convert spells into supernatural abilities, compressing the spellcasting time to within 6 seconds in one aspect, and eliminating the need for spellcasting materials such as needles and ink in another aspect.

As for this point, Zhao Xu can only envy it, as he can only obtain this ability at level 9.

When he casts spells, he no longer needs to carry around a bunch of unnecessary spellcasting materials.

Especially in the case of the "Web Art" spell in the second level, which requires the spellcaster to swallow a spider to gain the ability to climb vertically.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that he could not achieve this level of spellcasting, so he decided to consume 1 point of potential to simulate the "Spellcasting Without Materials" specialization, or use a magic scroll to cast spells.

As for the "Magic Tattoo" spell, the duration of which was extended from 24 hours to 48 hours, which is naturally due to the combination of "Spellcasting Delay" by An Ti Nuo Ya, doubling the duration.

For the next two days, Zhao Xu became a "Level 6 Ring Mage" with spellcasting effects.

After finishing his speech, Zhao Xu also took over the unknown talisman from An Ti Nuo Ya.

"What is the effect of this talisman?" Zhao Xu asked, unfolding the yellow copper chain of the talisman.

"It's really troublesome, every time I feed you, I have to explain to you what you're eating," An Ti Nuo Ya complained, directly pulling out a pair of glasses from her backpack and tossing them to Zhao Xu.

"In the future, you can identify the effects of magical items yourself," An Ti Nuo Ya said.

Zhao Xu looked at the glasses that were thrown to him, consisting of two parts: one part was a gold-framed mirror frame with lenses, and the other part was connected by a chain to a earpiece.

Zhao Xu immediately put on the glasses and looked at the talisman in front of him, but there was no reaction.
Here is the translation:

"This thing is called the Mechanism Person's Eye Mirror, 1500 gold coins, and you can deduct it from your apprentice's salary later." After Ahntinoja simply calculated the bill for Zhao Xu, she directly sat down on a soft sofa, clearly showing signs of fatigue.

"'By using the Mechanism Person's Eye Mirror, you can obtain the effect of identification through the 'Detection Magic' spell,'" Ahntinoja explained simply, and Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise.

The Identification Magic is a first-level spell that can detect the properties of magical items, and it requires a precious pearl worth 100 gold coins as a spell material. On the other hand, Detection Magic is a first-level spell that does not require any spell materials.

In other words, through this 1500-gold-coin magical item, all future identifications will be essentially free. Although Zhao Xu will master the "Supernatural Magic" in the future and won't have to spend 100 GP, it's still a "future" thing.

Zhao Xu suddenly thought of setting up a stall on the streets of Mistral to charge for identifying magical items for 100 gold coins each. As for the 25-gold-coin service fee, he considered it a kind gift from Ahntinoja.

However, Zhao Xu still honestly used the Mechanism Person's Eye Mirror to cast the "Detection Magic" spell.

The effect of the magical item appeared directly in front of him, and Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed slightly.

A quick action could rewind the surrounding time to 1 round (6 seconds) ago? Is this a divine artifact?
