Chapter 238: The Apex Giant Scythe

On a hill overlooking a secluded spot near the "Falling Star Lake", a sudden burst of glowing clouds appeared, startling a rabbit that was previously grazing and causing it to hastily scurry away.

About a second or two later, countless particles began to gather in mid-air, slowly taking shape to form a human figure.

Zhao Xu slowly shook off the dizziness caused by the "Higher Transmission Technique" spell, which was part of the "Higher Transmission" system. However, this sensation was not unfamiliar to him, and he gradually gained control over his body.

Only after the transmission spell was completed did his entire body stabilize, and he felt the weight of gravity once again.

At this moment, Zhao Xu gazed out at the unexplored hillside, where strange rocks and boulders were scattered about, and suddenly a flood of memories came rushing back.

The Higher Transmission Technique, as part of the Seventh Ring Arcane, had no distance limitations and allowed for precise targeting of the destination.

Zhao Xu therefore chose this hillside, which had a good view but was not suitable for battle, as his transmission destination.

Gazing into the distance, his exceptional intuition suddenly detected a battle unfolding over a thousand meters away.

About a hundred people were engaged in combat, with one side consisting of players equipped with minimal gear, while the other side was comprised of privately employed bodyguards fully armed.

As the sun began to set, the battlefield was bathed in a reddish glow, with the scent of blood lingering in the air. From time to time, players would fall to the ground, only to transform into a ball of light and disappear.

After a morning of intense battle, the mining guilds had begun to deploy their resources to counterattack the players.
When Zhao Xu saw this scene, he let out a deep sigh.

From the perspective of his classmates, they were already advanced players, possessing basic equipment and skills. They could even combine their abilities to form simple formations.

However, on the battlefield, players would wildly swing their weapons, unable to coordinate their attacks. Most group battles were small-scale, with only large guilds able to plan their compositions, personnel, and battlefield positions.

It was unrealistic to expect a team of 20 people to form a cohesive unit without months of training. As a result, they were easily defeated by the personal guards trained by the mining associations from a young age.

Zhao Xu possessed the supernatural abilities and spells granted by the Fēi Tiān Shì, including the attributes of the three attributes. However, he did not inherit the Fēi Tiān Shì's overwhelming attack power. Even if he didn't open his shield, he would only be a 4th-level mage with slightly higher attributes.

Therefore, Zhao Xu needed to find a shortcut to enhance his attack power. Otherwise, he could only rely on spells to deal damage, which would not activate his massive warhammer.

After observing the battlefield situation from a kilometer away, Zhao Xu began to prepare for his next spell. He needed to use spells to enhance his warhammer to an intimidating level.

Most buffs did not meet the requirements for "spell endurance," unless they were hourly-level spells. Otherwise, he would need to cast them on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the dormitory of the academy, Zhao Xu had already mastered the "Unbridled Hero's Aura" and had been casting it continuously since the beginning. From the moment he finished casting the spell, he would have a potential point every 20 rounds until 24 hours later.

In this 14400-round period, he would always have one potential point per round. Zhao Xu did not need to recast the "Unbridled Hero's Aura" every 20 rounds after the spell's duration expired.

This was the true meaning of the perpetual potential point. Non-casters, who owned the potential points, had only 5 points per level and could not stir up a big wave. Only casters like Zhao Xu, who had learned the "Unbridled Hero's Aura", would have a potential point to waste per round.

As Zhao Xu held the massive scythe in his hand, he felt the powerful energy transmitted from the weapon itself.

He had released the four-ring spell "Higher Magical Weapon" in his dormitory earlier. This spell, which lasted for one hour per caster level, made the massive scythe in his hand a "+5 Shadow" scythe for the next 20 hours.

He used the four-ring spell to temporarily bridge the gap between the "+5" weapon and the "+1" weapon. The price of a "+5 Shadow" scythe was over 70,000 gold coins, more expensive than a "+1 Shadow" scythe by over 50,000 gold coins.

However, Zhao Xu was not satisfied with this.

He directly used the nine-ring spell "Miracle" to simulate another six-ring spell "Higher Enchantment Weapon" from another multiverse.

This unique spell, exclusive to the academy, could grant special abilities to weapons, such as the "Shadow" ability that allowed Zhao Xu's scythe to kill ghostly bodies.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoxu's "+1 Shadow" great scythe itself has a price equivalent to "+2" magical weapons, as the "Shadow" attribute is valued at "+1" enhancement value.

This spell can temporarily provide an ability enhancement of "+5" value, or a total of 200,000 gold coins.

Zhaoxu instantly completes the attribute selection, and a powerful energy is absorbed onto the scythe, making it transform into a legendary weapon overnight.

At least during the duration of the spell, which lasts for 200 minutes.

This spell can only be customized through the use of the spell.

At this moment, after Zhaoxu supplements the spell, he suddenly flashes and teleports 300 meters away in an instant.

The four-ring spell "Arbitrary Door" allows for long-distance teleportation.

With Zhaoxu's 20th-level spellcasting level, he can teleport 360 meters in an instant, almost breaking the 400-meter world record of 43 seconds on Earth.

Moreover, Zhaoxu uses the higher-level five-ring spell "Higher Arbitrary Door", which allows him to activate the "Arbitrary Door" once every round for the next 10 rounds, without needing to simulate.

After three consecutive "Arbitrary Doors", Zhaoxu directly charges into the battlefield.

As a 20th-level cleric, Zhaoxu also uses spells to travel like Anniya.

After yesterday's forum initiative, players are wearing black cloth on their arms, symbolizing silent marching.

However, the equipment gap between the two sides is enormous, making it unnecessary for Zhaoxu to use "black cloth" to judge.

This time, Zhaoxu's flash teleportation startles the five people in the midst of battle.
Here is the translation of the text:

After half a day of battling, even if the mage has a spellbook, they have basically exhausted their abilities.

The mage in front of me, holding a wooden staff, is struggling to hold his own against a few enemy guards. Luckily, there's another priest in front of him, using up all his spells, holding up a heavy steel shield to defend himself.

The result is self-evident. The mage has even run out of ammunition for his long-range attacks.

All that's left is a wooden staff to rely on.

As for Zhao Xu, he directly lifted his massive scythe and charged forward with a fierce cry.

The leader of the warriors looked at Zhao Xu's massive scythe and couldn't help but sneer.

He had originally been inwardly afraid of Zhao Xu, who was a mage capable of casting "Arbitrary Doors".

Little did he know that the mage wasn't going to use his magic to kill him.

Facing this attack, he didn't hesitate to hold up the shield tied to his arm and take a step back to avoid the attack.

Although the mage's low-level attack didn't penetrate his full-body armor, he wasn't afraid at all.

However, after Zhao Xu swung his massive scythe with all his might, a sense of impending death washed over the warrior just as he was about to be struck.

But the warrior didn't sense any magical aura on his body, nor did he have any secret vision abilities, otherwise he would have seen that Zhao Xu's massive scythe was surrounded by a massive glowing aura.

It seemed that the scythe in Zhao Xu's hand had grown to enormous size, like a giant's weapon.

The scythe flashed through the air.

The warrior leader, with a shocked expression, suffered a massive wound that instantly depleted his life force, causing him to collapse to the ground and die on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text:

Two other warriors who were searching for an opportunity to attack were also shocked by this strange murder scene. Their team leader's life value was over 20!
Their team leader had previously withstood two fireballs and was not killed, and had even counterattacked the fifth-level mage. How did he just fall down like that?
Even the two players behind Zhao Xufang didn't understand what was happening.
It's not like they didn't get hit by a giant scythe, right?
Moreover, the team leader's entire body armor showed no signs of damage.
This was an air strike?
Recalling the mage who was fully covered in a cloak and wore a mask, and combined with the image of wielding a scythe of death, everyone's heart suddenly felt a chill.
Death is not scary.
What's scary is dying without even getting hit by a sword.
However, the players around Zhao Xufang were stunned, but Zhao Xufang did not stop.
He still lacked the sense of attack power and had not yet unleashed the "連擊" (chain attack) technique.
However, this did not affect his ability to directly use the warrior's exclusive skill "順勢斬" (taking advantage of the momentum to strike).
Taking advantage of the momentum of the scythe, Zhao Xufang directly struck the warrior who was holding two swords beside him.
A double kill, and blood splattered everywhere.
"Ah, the Grim Reaper has come!"
The other warrior finally felt his legs go weak, having just witnessed his teammate being beheaded before he even had a chance to react.
This gruesome scene shocked all the players and warriors involved in the battle.
Although many people had fallen to the ground, most of them had died from accumulated injuries rather than a single critical hit.
It's rare to see a human with over 20,000 life value being instantly killed by a beheading attack!
Just then, those who were paying attention to the battle on this side felt a chill run down their spines. They saw that the giant scythe was sliding across the opponent's chest, and then a formless knife energy was unleashed to decapitate the opponent. Who would have thought that Arthur's warriors' battles would become this fantastical...
