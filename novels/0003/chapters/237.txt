Chapter 238: Top-grade Celestial Scythe

On the hillside of the "Falling Star Lake", a mysterious, cloud-like glow suddenly emerged from a hidden location, startling a rabbit that was previously grazing. The rabbit hastily scurried away.

About a second or two later, countless particles gathered in mid-air, slowly coming together to form a person-like shape. Zhao Xun was slowly shaking off the disorienting feeling caused by the "High-Speed Transmission" spell, which was a part of the "Higher Transmission" technique.

However, this feeling was not unfamiliar to him, and he gradually gained control over his body. It wasn't until the transmission spell was complete that his physical state stabilized, and he felt the binding force of gravity once more.

At this moment, Zhao Xun gazed out at the unexplored, rugged hillside in front of him, and suddenly a flood of memories from his past came rushing back.

The "Higher Transmission" technique, which was a part of the Seven Ring Magic, had no limitations on the distance of transmission and could precisely locate the destination. Therefore, Zhao Xun directly chose this hillside, which had a good view but was not suitable for battle, as his transmission destination.

He gazed out into the distance, using his exceptional observational skills to suddenly discover a battle unfolding on the original terrain over a thousand meters away.

About a hundred people were engaged in combat, with one side consisting of players equipped with extremely simple gear, and the other side consisting of private bodyguards fully armed from head to toe.

As the sun began to set, the battlefield was bathed in a warm glow, with the scent of blood and the setting sun's afterglow mingling together. Periodically, players would fall to the ground, only to dissipate into a burst of light.

After the intense battle earlier in the day, the mine owners had begun to mobilize their resources to counterattack the players.

Upon seeing this scene, Zhao Xu let out a slight sigh. For his classmates who are also players of King Arthur's Waist, they have already mastered the basics of armor equipment and can even combine simple formations according to instructions. However, it's like a scene on the open plain where several players are wildly swinging their swords, completely unable to organize a battle plan. In their usual team compositions, most players are in small groups and only guilds can plan professional ratios, personnel deployment, and battlefield arrangements. It's impossible for a team of 20 people to form a cohesive unit without a month of training. As a result, they are easily defeated by the private guards raised by the mining associations since childhood.

Zhao Xu has obtained the supernatural abilities and spells of the Holy Servant of the Blazing Heaven, as well as the attributes of the three surrounding elements. However, he has not obtained the Holy Servant's extremely powerful attack power. Even if he doesn't open his shield, he is just a 4th-level mage with slightly higher attributes. Therefore, Zhao Xu needs to find a shortcut to enhance his own attack power. Otherwise, he can only use spells to cause damage, but that would not activate the giant scythe in his hand. Therefore, after observing the battlefield situation 10 kilometers away, Zhao Xu began to prepare to continue casting spells. He needs to use spells to enhance the giant scythe to a terrifying level. Generally, spells that enhance weapons do not meet the "spell endurance" requirements, unless they have a duration of several hours, in which case he would have to cast them on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the dormitory of the academy, the "Unbridled Hero's Spirit" had already been mastered by Zhao Xu in the format of "Perpetual Durability" before the spell was completed.

From the moment the spell was completed to 24 hours later, Zhao Xu would have a potential point every 20 rounds.

Zhao Xu did not need to cast the "Unbridled Hero's Spirit" again every 20 rounds after the spell's duration had expired.

This is the true meaning of perpetual potential points.

Non-casters who own potential points have only 5 points per level and cannot create a large impact.

Only those who have learned the "Unbridled Hero's Spirit" spell, like Zhao Xu, have a wasted potential point every round that they can use.

At that time, Zhao Xu was holding the massive scythe in his hand, feeling the powerful energy transmitted from the weapon itself.

He had already released the four-ring spell "Higher Magical Weapons" in the dormitory beforehand.

This spell, which lasts for one hour per caster level, made Zhao Xu's "+1 Shadow" scythe into a "+5 Shadow" scythe for the next 20 hours.

He used a four-ring spell to temporarily compensate for the difference between "+5" weapons and "+1" weapons.

The price of a "+5 Shadow" scythe is over 70,000 gold coins, which is much more expensive than a "+1 Shadow" scythe.

However, Zhao Xu was not satisfied with this.

He needed a legendary weapon!

Zhao Xu directly used the nine-ring spell "Miracle" to simulate another six-ring spell "Higher Enchantment" from another multidimensional world.

This unique spell can give weapons common special abilities, such as the ability for Zhao Xu's scythe to kill ghostly bodies.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's "+1 Shadow" giant scythe is equivalent to a "+2" magical weapon in terms of price, as the "Shadow" attribute is worth "+1" in terms of enhancement value.

This spell can temporarily provide an ability enhancement of "+5" in value, or a total enhancement limit of 200,000 gold coins.

Zhao Xu also instantly completes the attribute selection, and a powerful energy is absorbed onto the scythe, making it transform into a legendary weapon.

At least during the duration of the spell, which lasts for 200 minutes.

This spell can only be used to customize the weapon.

Now, Zhao Xu supplements the spell with multiple others and suddenly flashes, teleporting directly to a distance of over 300 meters in an instant.

The four-ring spell "Arbitrary Gate" allows for long-distance teleportation.

With Zhao Xu's 20th-level spellcasting ability, he can teleport a distance of 360 meters with just a thought.

The world record for 400 meters on Earth is around 43 seconds.

Moreover, Zhao Xu uses a higher-level five-ring spell "Higher Arbitrary Gate" that allows him to activate the "Arbitrary Gate" spell once every round for the next 10 rounds without needing to simulate.

Therefore, after Zhao Xu uses the "Arbitrary Gate" spell three times in a row, he directly charges into the battlefield.

After becoming a 20th-level priest, Zhao Xu also uses spells to travel, just like Anzhiya.

Following yesterday's forum initiative, players are currently all wearing black cloth on their arms, symbolizing silent marching.

However, the huge gap in equipment between the two sides means that Zhao Xu has no need to judge through "black cloth".

He suddenly flashes and frightens the five people who were in the midst of battle.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

After half a day of battling, even if the wizard has a scroll, they've basically used up most of their spells. The wizard on the battlefield is now holding a wooden staff and fighting alongside a few other enemy guards, with a priest standing in front of him, wielding a heavy steel shield to defend against the enemy. The outcome is clear, and the wizard has even exhausted their arrows. All that's left is a wooden staff to rely on.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, is holding a massive scythe in his hand, charging forward with a fierce cry. The leader of the warriors looks at Zhao Xu's scythe and can't help but sneer.

He had originally been wary of Zhao Xu, who was a wizard capable of casting "any door" spells. But who would have thought that the scythe would be the one to deal the fatal blow? The wizards are not just swordsmen, after all.

The warrior leader took Zhao Xu's scythe head-on, holding up the shield on his arm to block the attack and retreating slightly to avoid the blow. Despite being struck by the scythe, he didn't feel any pain, but he did sense a crushing sense of death approaching.

However, he didn't sense any magical aura on his body, nor did he have any secret vision abilities, or he would have seen that Zhao Xu's scythe was surrounded by a huge ring of light. It seemed that Zhao Xu's scythe had grown to enormous size, like a giant's weapon. The swordlight flashed over.

The warrior leader's face turned white with terror, and a massive wound suddenly drained his life force, causing him to collapse to the ground and die on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two warriors who were searching for an opportunity to attack were also shocked by this bizarre murder scene. Their leader's life force, which was over 20, was still intact.

Their leader had previously been hit by two fireballs and was severely injured but not killed. He had even counterattacked against a level 5 mage.

How could he just fall down like that?

Even the two players behind Zhao Xufang were unable to understand what was happening.

It's not like they hadn't taken any damage, right?

Moreover, the leader's entire body armor didn't have any signs of damage.

This must have been an instant kill attack.

Recalling the mage who was shrouded in a cloak and hiding his face, and the image of him swinging a giant scythe, everyone's heart was filled with a chill.

Death is not scary.

What's scary is dying without even taking a scratch.

However, the players around him were in a state of shock, but Zhao Xufang didn't stop. He was still not able to unleash the full potential of his "chain attack" due to his low attack power.

However, he didn't let that stop him from using his warrior's exclusive skill "follow the flow"!

Taking advantage of the momentum of the giant scythe, Zhao Xufang directly slashed at the warrior who was holding two swords.

One strike, two kills. Fresh blood splattered everywhere.

"Ah, the Grim Reaper has arrived!"

The other warrior finally felt his legs go weak. He had just witnessed his teammate being beheaded without even having time to react.

This gruesome scene was enough to stun the players and warriors who were involved in the battle.

Although many people had fallen to the ground, most of them had died from accumulated injuries.

It's rare to see a human, even with over 20,000 life force, die from a single beheading attack!
Just now, those who fought alongside him were shocked to the core, their hearts trembling with fear as they saw - the giant scythe was sliding across the opponent's chest, and then a formless blade of energy beheaded the opponent.

Who would have thought that Arthur's warrior's fight had become this kind of fantasy...
