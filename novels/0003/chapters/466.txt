Chapter 467: Legendary Magic Dragon Tribe Assault

Zhao Xu, who was standing beside, had already shifted his attention to An Tiya. "The ancient magical empire" had been buried since Ernest collected all of Arthur's treasures and formed the "Treasure Vault". However, after Ernest disappeared from this world, the entire nation collapsed.

It wasn't occupied by a certain power, but because it had exhausted its resources and naturally collapsed. Alternatively, when Arthur's numerous gods and legendary strongmen could no longer tolerate the sword of Damocles hanging above their heads.

Later, the "Mage Association" organization inherited the entire organizational structure and system passed down from the ancient magical empire, but it was far from recovering its former glory, not even one percent.

As for the "Ancient Alliance Covenant" mentioned by An Tiya, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh in awe.

Although giant dragons really flew overhead, even when the people of the magical empire were numerous, few people had the ability to verify this claim. However, the moment this covenant was established, it meant that the giant dragon had effectively given up its air superiority, which was an unbearable thing.

The ancient white dragon in front of him didn't even bother to refute the mention of this covenant, and instead directly asked for mercy, which made Zhao Xu realize that An Tiya's "Heir to the Magical Empire" identity still exerted an unspeakable influence.

It wasn't just her legendary mage identity.

"What do you want?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Anzhenoia didn't pay attention to the ancient white dragon's question, but instead turned around and asked Zhao Xu about something on the side. At this moment, the white dragon Sereus was also looking at Zhao Xu with a hopeful expression, wanting to give some advice, but was afraid to speak up because he didn't want to be rejected and have himself beaten. Not to mention, looking at this zhongxiao shifu, who seemed to be a decent person, and estimated that he wouldn't like to see such a despicable dragon.

The white dragons in front, bathing in the snow-white snow, were staring at Zhao Xu with their eyes wide open, as if they were waiting for something to happen. From the moment their ancestor, the ancient white dragon, submitted, these young white dragons' lives were no longer in their own hands.

"What?" Zhao Xu hesitated, "what are my options?"

"Break their bones and scatter their ashes, or let them accept the task, but it's probably just once," Anzhenoia offered her options.

The word "break their bones and scatter their ashes," which looked extremely brutal, came out of Anzhenoia's mouth, and the ancient white dragon's breath fluctuated, as if it was about to burst out and attack at any moment.

It had lived for over a thousand years, and this was the first time it had been subjected to such humiliation.

The frost giants in the Glacier Mountain range would usually kill white dragons just for armor or food, and only use them as guards. It was unlike the current female shifu, who had come up with the option to break their bones and scatter their ashes.

Zhao Xu heard this and was slightly stunned.

After a pause, he spoke up, "But how can I guarantee they'll help me this one time?"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ten or so giant dragons, even if they are all white dragons, can cause a significant impact by following Zhao Xu's "order" and directly attacking the city. The dragons have already become the "top-tier tanks" of King Arthur's existence, crushing the "infantry" and "cavalry" and achieving a dimensional strike effect. Like the fortress town of Zhaotian, which lacks defensive power, it's not even necessary to launch a sneak attack, and they can directly crush the enemy.

Having a team of white dragons that follow orders is equivalent to having a powerful "air strike" capability in the "Northern Alliance", which is enough to let Zhao Xu start a snowball effect.

Just as Anzhi Nikola nodded and was about to provide a solution, the ancient white dragon suddenly spoke up: "Impossible!"

As he said this, he glared at several people, "Dragons will not submit to the orders of the weak!"

Zhao Xu couldn't help but turn around and look at the white dragon, Serus, by his side.

It seemed a bit off.

The ancient white dragon was clearly unwilling to submit to the orders of the weak. It seemed that this was a more serious "loss" to them than death.

Only Serus quickly clarified, "The orders of the strong will still be obeyed."

However, Zhao Xu's gaze remained unchanged.

His meaning was clear: Serus was listening to Anzhi Nikola's orders as his reason for being a bodyguard.

According to reason, the ancient white dragon should also follow Anzhi Nikola's orders and listen to him once. How could there be such a difference?
At that moment, Serus also wore an embarrassed expression, understanding and explaining, "Because the extremely powerful fireball spell you released cleared the winter wolves, I have already considered you to be a powerful mage, and it's not embarrassing to take orders from you."

Zhao Xu listened and nodded slightly.

He had reached the "strong one" line in Serus's heart, making it possible for him to convince himself to take orders.

It seemed that there was a lot of room for maneuvering here.

"Miss Anniya, you want us to take orders from this young mage, which goes against the ancient covenant," said the ancient dragon, almost apologetically explaining a few sentences.

If they could kill them, they would have them accept slavery, and once this news spread, the dragon clan would have no peaceful days.

"So, what's the hurry? I've made this decision with complete preparation. The covenant has half its contents written by me, can't I forget it?" Anniya said, and then confirmed with Zhao Xu again: "It seems you're asking for the aid of a giant dragon?"

Zhao Xu nodded.

In reality, the difficulty lay in ensuring that these giant dragons could fulfill their obligations.

The method of controlling Serus was because Anniya had used a "tight binding curse" that required the support of a "must-die spell". As for the ancient dragon, it had already entered the scope of attention of the evil god Tyramet. If you really wanted to take its life, it was very likely to be intervened by Tyramet and dissolved.

"That's it."

Anniya then gazed ahead, lightly lifting her hand with a faint greenish tint, and began to draw an invisible magical array in the air.

What kind of spell is this?

Zhao Xu was stunned as he looked at the mysterious symbols drawn by Anniya in the air.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Time had already exceeded the usual duration, and Anzhiya's gestures and incantations had also exceeded the usual time. This spellcasting time directly led to the appearance of a completely new hypothesis.

Even the ancient white dragon couldn't help but exclaim in surprise: "How is this spell?"

As soon as he finished speaking, a mysterious glow flashed, and a mysterious arcane script fluttered in, as if it had come to life, beginning to hover in the sky.

In an instant, a powerful force descended upon the many white dragons gathered around Orus, including the ancient white dragon, causing them to float in the air, surrounded by unstable teleportation energy.

Each of them had an intangible, hard-to-see aura around them.

Then, Anzhiya handed a gemstone to Zhao Xu, saying, "Take it, and when the time comes, crush this gemstone, and the ability inside will be released. These white dragons will be summoned to launch an attack."

As she spoke, she cast a satisfied glance at the ancient white dragon, who had just spoken up, saying, "This is my summoning channel, and it doesn't violate the rules. However, I'm asking you to delay your response indefinitely."

Hearing this, the white dragon also nodded slightly, and then it scanned Zhao Xu with a gaze that was half sharp and half murky.

But after looking at Zhao Xu's magical equipment, the white dragon took a deep breath and seemed to be a bit troubled.

"Then, let's retreat first," Anzhiya said, looking at the guards on the side who were about to recover, and ordering the white dragons before her.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, the ancient white dragons within included, numbering over ten giant dragons, as if they had engines installed, and even didn't need to communicate, directly taking off and flying around the same spot.

It was as if the snow-covered land before them was a formless fiery pit, baking the white dragons to an unbearable extent.

"This is that legendary spell?" Suddenly, the white dragon Serus beside him spoke up.

"Not wrong, the legendary spell of the dragon tribe's attack." Anistia said.

"When the ancient alliance was determined, two legendary spells for summoning the dragon tribe were determined and recorded in the alliance. One was the 'Dragon Knight' legendary spell, which summons a single giant dragon. The other, the 'Dragon Tribe's Attack' spell, is what I just cast."

"This spell can summon over ten giant dragons, and in a short time, it can significantly impact the balance of power in the Northern Alliance."

Anistia said, "And actually, I only half-cast this spell, directing these half-filled, water-filled white dragons. It won't be complete until you shatter that gemstone."

"Teacher," Xu Shou glanced at Serus beside him and then at Anistia, "I understand the principle, but I'm a bit curious, will the journey ahead be very dangerous?"

Seeing the white dragon Serus was like grabbing a seat for a ride.

Seeing the white dragon army was also using the legendary spell to grab some help once.

It seemed like he wanted to stage a rebellion within the city of Auror, so Anistia was working hard to implant strength in him.

"You can understand it that way too," Anistia said.

"Even now, you'll have to be prepared to pay the price of several revival stones."
