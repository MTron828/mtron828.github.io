Chapter 582: The Secret of Magic, Anniya's Memories

Zhao Xu finally looked up, guessing the underlying waves, but he didn't expect such intense consequences.

It turned out that no matter what he did, it was impossible to add more players to the small boat that had already been "loaded" with players.

Fate had already chosen each lucky winner and allocated rewards, and everything was predetermined.

The notification caused by "Wang Congwei" was still manageable, and the impact on the material energy channel was minimal.

Because the other party was someone who could keep secrets, even their own parents. Wang Congwei didn't say anything.

If he had brought up the "seven prophecies" earlier and referred to a higher level, it would have been fine.

But if he had presented crucial evidence, such as retelling the "prophecies" like before.

Then only one thing would happen: the secret would no longer be a secret.

Instantly, the material energy channel of "Arthur" would be cut off, and players would face the harsh reality of the wilderness earlier.

And the only ones who would benefit would be those who were earliest to "leak" the information.

"As for your other confusion, I can also guess what it is - that you feel too far removed from ordinary people, is that it?" Anniya said, bringing the conversation back on track.

"You once entered the game as a projection, but your body was still on Earth. Although you had some influence in Arthur, you were still just an ordinary, unknown person on Earth, so you didn't experience this immense difference."
Here is the translation of the text:

Until all the people crossed over and saw their old friends, family, and classmates struggling for survival in this desolate land. They saw people they had walked alongside in their lives, now with different social status, and this feeling of unreality, this emptiness, suddenly emerged.

It's like a merchant who becomes rich in a foreign land, and only feels the value of their wealth when they return to their hometown. Only then do they realize the value of their wealth.

Zhao Xu nodded in confusion, realizing that An Ti Nuo Ya had accurately described his inner thoughts with great detail. Even this point he had never mentioned to her, and An Ti Nuo Ya wanted to read his heart, having previously removed his "psychic barrier" and cast the "Control" spell on himself. This was the rule of Arthur, unless a new rule challenged it.

"I understand you because we are fellow travelers," An Ti Nuo Ya said with a sigh.

As she spoke, she gazed out at the distant horizon, as if the answer to life lay there.

"I was once a war orphan, a small girl with no one to rely on, living in the dark era. I saw countless blood and fire in that era. In the era when the old country was on the verge of collapse, waiting for the rise of a new country, I didn't know where I would eat from day to day. It wasn't until I met him that I was adopted without any reason."

"It seems that I am the luckiest person in the world. After all, like May, I had to kneel down to show respect."

"At that time, I was like the mud under this land, jumping directly to the heavenly clouds. That's what you feel, this unreality."

An Ti Nuo Ya's voice became low and somber, "This is also the reason I just asked you to describe 'memory'."

Here is the translation of the text:

"When you, with some questions about the morality of some talented young people, cast this spell to reconstruct their correct personalities, planning to let it become an indispensable part of them after more than ten years."

"No matter how you think, you will feel that humans are not much different."

"Through the art of memory manipulation, you can manipulate personalities with ease."

"Through the resurrection and death manipulation arts, you can control life and death at will."

"Time can be stopped, reversed, and even controlled by you, just like the power that cannot be reached."

"In the winter of Fenrir, you can control the weather, and even the natural seasons will obey your commands."

"Therefore, as some mages gradually reach the peak of their abilities, some of them will develop an inflated sense of self-importance, thinking that they can become all-powerful rulers with their magic."

As Anzuo Niya spoke, her gaze deepened, looking at Zhao Xu, "I'm delighted that you have realized this difference and have allowed this lesson to come earlier."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath at this moment, feeling that the air blown by the original summer breeze had become a cold and biting wind, gently urging him forward.

He muttered to himself, "The divine magic given by the gods is naturally all glory to the gods, and not to themselves who are immortal."

"A mage can only grasp a limited number of spells and can only dig up the remaining power of magic from their own bloodlines. They cannot be all-powerful, and even if they want to jump, there will be other mages who use the same spells to suppress them."

"The only way to bridge this gap is for mages to accept the entire magical education system from the beginning and gradually derive the truth of the magical world."

"This gap will lead to their deep faith in magic. Therefore, powerful mages will have already reached the limit of believing in the goddess of magic, and few will continue to believe in other gods, unless the other party is also a powerful mage."
Here is the translation:

"If I really feel like I can do anything in the magical dimension and feel like I can compare to the gods, what kind of consequences would it lead to?"

"It's simple, you'll become a 'source of trouble' for magic," Anniya said. "Just like in some celestial worlds, powerful mages who abuse magic have led to the downfall of the entire magical empire."

"July, remember that in most aspects of this world, including your every spell, there are residual effects left behind."

"Even though everyone thinks that the spell of prayer is all-powerful, it's actually the same."

"The 'golden' you create through prayer is actually just moving it from an unseen, unexplored gold mine area where no one can see. Because the way magic is implemented is always towards the path of least resistance. This is also the reason why prayer spells are often misunderstood."

Anniya's accidental mention of this sentence immediately caught Zhao Xu's inner heart.

He spoke with a faint tremble in his voice, "Path of least resistance?"

"No mistake, July, this is what my mentor Ernest told me, and it's also the deepest secret of prayer spells."

"I'm telling you now, with your intelligence, you can naturally infer the edge of prayer spell power from this point. From now on, how to use this spell will no longer be a secret or a puzzle for you. However, you should know the true reason why I'm telling you this. We mages are not all-powerful."

"It's just that our magic can find the shortest path of least resistance in all things and achieve it."

Today, Anniya's words, like the morning bell and evening drum, struck Zhao Xu's heart once again.

It's not an increase in magical knowledge, but rather a revelation of the entire magical system's "worldview".

What is the true nature of Arthur's magic?
Here is the translation of the text:

"Upon seeing the people below and begging for a spot in the magic learning program, I felt I owed you even more after that," said Zhao Xu with a wry smile.

Anastasia revealed the secrets he had uncovered, which even legendary wizards would treasure.

This had transcended technique and reached the level of the Way.

"Hmph, it's not that I didn't appreciate your painstaking education all these years," Anastasia nodded in satisfaction, "but now I have something to ask of you."

"Please watch a segment of my memory and let me know if it has been edited," Anastasia said sternly.
