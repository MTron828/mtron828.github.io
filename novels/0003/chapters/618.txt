Chapter 619: The Secret of the Nine Swords, Unveiling the System

"Unbelievable, I'm back so quickly," said the old man Wén Bǎi, looking at Zhao Xu with a hint of incredulity.

"The ultimate scroll indeed lives up to its reputation as the strongest divine artifact. I've only approached it, and my entire knowledge has been grasped by it."

As the old man Wén Bǎi spoke, he lifted his head and continued to gaze at the distant starry sky.

"The result is that you've just obtained the secret of 'Iron Heart Power' from it. It's as if destiny has brought you together. Since that's the case, you should cherish some time and tell me what you want to learn."

At this point, the old man Wén Bǎi seemed to be more melancholy than his initial demeanor.

"I can't guarantee when I'll wake up again or who will take over," he said.

"That's why, sir, when you became conscious, there was no problem, but when you woke up, this space became extremely chaotic, with hidden dangers lurking everywhere."

In truth, Zhao Xu had just barely woken up before being torn apart by these cutting forces. He had only just realized that the corpses suspended above were all entangled like spider silk. If not for this method, he would have been torn into pieces like a piece of dried meat.

"Because this place is where Ernest targeted me, not the current me. Naturally, when I was alive, everything was fine," said Wén Bǎi, pushing Zhao Xu, who was still in thought.

"You youngster, hurry up! Is what you're saying true or false? You can say it's Wén Bǎi who taught you, and Anzhi Noja will verify it again. What's the point of all this fuss?"

As he spoke, he seemed like he was about to explode with anger.

Zhao Xu hastily bowed, not expecting that he would also have his day to be pushed to the wall.

"Go ahead, tell me about your initial plan first," Ying bu Bai took back the ancient weapon "Transmission" and directly inserted it into the ground, leaning against it as a backrest.

Zhao Xu also understood that time was pressing, and the next time Ying bu Bai awakened, he might not be able to forcefully awaken the old version of "Nine Swords Master" Win two Gou.

At this time, the more he understood about the Nine Swords, the greater his confidence would be when facing the future.

Zhao Xu also immediately explained his future career plan on the spot.

Suddenly, the old man Ying bu Bai stroked his scattered beard and nodded, saying, "It seems that the 'Red Jade Guard' is indeed a greedy and arrogant one, and it's no wonder that he has a strong and unyielding spirit."

As he spoke, Ying bu Bai pointed and said, "You're learning the Nine Swords to make up for the fact that you're not as skilled as a 'Heart Sorcerer' in terms of movement and flexibility. And the divine system of the 'Nine Swords' is also unable to compensate for this. So, you've indeed chosen the right path."

As he spoke, he seemed a bit troubled, "But the question is, who can defeat you now? Even the true gods might not be able to surround you."

"Anyway, heaven will fall, and I'll be the one stuck at the bottom," Ying bu Bai's expression changed, and he entered a teaching mode, with his eyes shining brighter.

"So, your current question is, which direction should you choose?"

The topic returned to the Nine Swords, and Ying bu Bai's entire body seemed to radiate a golden glow, with the ancient weapon behind him also emitting a pulse.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu said, "I'm about to ask Old Master for guidance." As he spoke, he sat down.

Wen Bufei stroked his long beard and said, "It looks simple. To advance to the Red Jade Guard, you need to become a 'Ten-Cross Sword' (十字军) first, and master 'Iron Heart Power' to smoothly exit this trap. First, become a 'Warrior's Sword' (战刃)."

"What do you plan to do?" Wen Bufei asked.

Unbeknownst to Wen Bufei, Zhao Xu shook his head, "I know this much, but I've always been unclear about the Nine Swords. I've always been familiar with the surface but not the depths. I'm hoping to rely on this opportunity to learn from your teachings."

It seemed like a magical book, with various notes and summaries from previous researchers.

However, the Nine Swords system seemed to maintain the traditional one-on-one transmission of master and apprentice, adhering to the rule that "law does not transmit six ears" and "secret books do not fall into words."

Unless one could forcefully grasp a "Nine Swords" professional, it would be difficult to learn easily.

This closed-off nature also led to the various schools within the Nine Swords system becoming fragmented and disconnected, making it difficult to integrate.

Without investigative power, there was no speaking power, so no matter who Zhao Xu sought guidance from, he could only see a glimpse of the framework from the other's "Nine Swords System", and it was impossible to see the overall picture, let alone integrate it.

However, the present Wen Bufei, who claimed to be the "Founder of Nine Swords", was the most suitable person for this comprehensive overview.

When he heard Zhao Xu's request, Wen Bufei burst out laughing, "Really, he can't even walk and wants to fly."

"Then I'll give you an outline of the key points of several professions," Wen Bufei said.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As the old man raised his finger in the air, a few small, glowing people suddenly appeared, dancing around Zhao Xu. The little people's movements, however, did not seem like random dancing.

Zhao Xu quickly exerted his own actual intelligence, preparing to remember these movement elements.

"Say a thousand, speak a ten thousand, but I'll tell you about the martial arts level first."

"Martial arts level determines how high a level you can learn a technique, such as the White Swan Hammer at the eighth level. You need to be a 15th-level martial artist to learn it. However, don't worry, our Nine Swords are not as rigid as your wizarding schools."

"Theoretically, the foundation professions and advancements in the Nine Swords system are all 1st-level, while non- Nine Swords professions are 2nd-level. Therefore, as a 10th-level wizard, your martial arts level is 5th-level, allowing you to learn third-level techniques and steps."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, "So, after becoming legendary, I can just promote to a Nine Swords foundation profession and start with a Nine Swords technique from the beginning."

"Not necessarily, but the problem is that they usually require mastering three to four techniques within the same system, so you're still stuck."

"What about the three major foundation professions, Ten Thousand Swords (Heavenly Judgment), Battle Edge (Military Way), and Swordsmanship (Wise Sage)?"

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Nine Swords advancements, including the Jade Phoenix, Eternal Blade, Shadow Day, Blood Claw Master, Nine Swords Master, Red Jade Guard, and Deep Stone Sentinel?"

"Let me tell you one by one."

As the old man finished speaking, he suddenly pulled out a cigarette from nowhere, took a deep drag, and looked completely different from his refined and dignified appearance just moments before.

"However, before that, I have to ask you one question."

"What kind of weapon do you want to use?"
