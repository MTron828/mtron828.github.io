Chapter 687: The Activated Pit of the Mage Type

Oh, truly!

As rumored, Ernest directly absorbed the vast potential of the entire empire when he realized he was about to leave this world, amassing treasures like a tyrant collecting all the treasures in the world. At that moment, Ernest became like the final boss in a fantasy novel, absorbing all the spiritual energy in the world and gathering it within himself.

This extreme method also led to the empire's downfall within a decade after Ernest's death, losing its eternal monarch's position. Originally, Anzhenya, who could continue to enjoy a thousand years of peace, lost her "princess" title and returned to a ordinary role. She even hid her identity as a legendary mage and witnessed the rise and fall of gods for millennia as an onlooker.

Ernest's first disciple, May, became angry and parted ways with Anzhenya due to their disagreement. Each had their own plans.

According to Anzhenya's words at the time, this treasure trove was intended to be used to negotiate for the "safety" of a person with the gods. It was like buying one's life.

Undoubtedly, there was only one choice - Anzhenya, Ernest's closest disciple.

It was this enormous treasure trove that prompted the gods, who had been suppressed by Ernest for so long, to give up their idea of joint revenge.

The treasury, which was astonishing, could, even if only half of it was obtained, be used to infinitely expand Anzhenya's faith and achieve divine power, allowing her to ascend to the peak of the gods. If Anzhenya continued to hold Ernest's empire, she could also use it to achieve the highest level of divinity.
Here is the translation of the text:

As she was like a girl who possessed a heavenly inheritance, she gazed out at the scene before her, filled with relatives who eyed her greedily. She could resist one or two of them, but she couldn't resist all of them.

So Ernest suddenly cut off the lifeblood of the empire, handing it over to God.

It was because of this "treasure contract" that the magic empire's first divine war was triggered, causing the entire divine system to reshuffle, eliminating the possibility of threatening Anzhi.

She had remained peaceful ever since.

Zhao Xu suddenly thought about how Anzhi had always been willing to give him the "treasure".

Just like the previous queen, Congwei, who had obtained a vast fortune with her modest appearance, successfully ruling over a global empire with billions of people.

Anzhi had always seemed completely unconcerned about the issue of transporting the treasure's wealth.

It turned out that she had been hiding in the wilderness all along?

At that moment, a wave of historical significance washed over Zhao Xu's mind, leaving him feeling astonished, wondering if he had really encountered the "true treasure"?

Just like that, so easily?

Zhao Xu's mind suddenly felt hot, but he quickly regained his composure.

No!

Anzhi had previously said that when Ernest was setting up the plan, he had made a distinction between the "true treasure" and the "false treasure", with the value of the two exceeding tenfold!

Later, the "false treasure" was given to the coachman "Matthew" by Anzhi, who inherited Anzhi's surname "Itler" and went on to establish the Itler dynasty.

That "false treasure" was also the famous "lost heritage of the Itler dynasty" that appeared later. After the dynasty was overthrown, it was returned to Anzhi's hands.

The treasure that the previous queen Congwei obtained, as well as the one that Anzhi had promised to give him, was actually this same "treasure".
Here is the translation of the text:

The "True Repository" - "The Secret Hoard of King Ernest of Avalon" - was unknown to anyone, unseen by anyone, and yet to be discovered. This reminded me of the time I met the eight-ring wizard, Ryan, who had been guarding a hidden underground chamber in his pursuit of treasure, only to find that the result was worthless to Anya. He was so naive that he didn't know the world.

Zhao Xu had already calmed down and was maintaining his extraordinary vigilance and tranquility, watching the stone chamber before him.

As for the opponent's ambiguous words, they were insufficient to become crucial evidence.

Especially in this instant observation, he had already detected some clues.

The "Nine Rings" "Living City" naturally lacked the ability to give the city arbitrary freedom to cast the "Restraining Spell". The greater possibility was that the "Puppet Master" before him was another kind of "Living Vault".

A legendary being of extraordinary power above the standard.

Thinking of the ability of the Living Vault, he was also a bit troubled.

The opponent was completely immune to all magic and supernatural influences, which meant that Zhao Xu's attempt to break through the spell resistance with the "Supernatural Spell" would be futile.

The only effective thing was to cast the opposing spell "Release" to suppress the opponent's ability to use the "Restraining Spell" for 10 turns, as well as ignore spell resistance spells.

It was better than nothing.

"Why, if you are the embodiment of the True Repository, how can you still become the primitive deity worshiped by the cannibalistic demons?" Zhao Xu asked with a calm tone.

"What primitive deity, where did you get such a disgusting vocabulary?" The voice in the void responded, and after revealing his identity, he also exuded a hint of smugness.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Providing shelter and harvesting faith is what Old Europe taught me to do." The existence in the void replied, "Their value is that they got the opportunity to live." "As for you, there's no utilization value whatsoever." "Unlike the interesting Miss Qi I met before, who is a half-dragon girl with a beautiful appearance and a pleasant voice..."

Just as the other party seemed to be lost in thought, they suddenly stopped speaking. "But you've destroyed my army of believers, and the old, weak, and sick ones who are left are completely meaningless. Even if I just ate them all, it's hard to make up for the losses I've suffered." "How are you going to compensate me?" the existence in the void said with a belch.

Eat?

Could this existence possibly be a chaotic evil demon?

Zhao Xuyu's mind was filled with various thoughts, and he looked astonished.

Although a demon-eating demon was eaten by another existence, it was still a cruel act.

But Zhao Xuyu's face changed in an instant, as he suddenly thought of the "survivors" he had seen when he first arrived.

He suddenly turned around, with only a stone wall behind him.

The rough wall was covered in fine cracks and was home to many fungi, but the mud applied to it emitted a sense of danger, as if touching it would bring disaster. At the same time, the stone wall continued to vibrate with a loud, rumbling sound, as if a bulldozer was mercilessly devouring Zhao Xuyu!

Having just failed to use his strength to resist, Zhao Xuyu had lost the illusion of fighting back bare-handed.

This thing really will crush him like an ant!

"Turn to dust!" Zhao Xuyu instinctively cast the "Change" spell from the "Five Rings" set.
Here is the translation of the text:

According to his current level of magical ability, he can already transform thousands of cubic meters of stone into a liquid of the same volume, equivalent to the capacity of a cement mixer truck that runs on the hundreds of roads on Earth.

More importantly, this spell can ignore resistance, unaffected by magical immunity.

However, Zhao Xu instantly saw the spell's brilliance merge with the wall and then disappear without a trace!
The cow entered the sea, leaving no shadow.

However, Zhao Xu saw this scene and didn't lose a shred of confidence.
This had verified his judgment.
"The stone becomes mud" can only affect unworked natural stone, and stone imbued with magic is unaffected.
So, there's no need to think about using this spell to dig someone else's nest, but Zhao Xu's magical ability is already high enough to simply affect the foundation, and it's extremely powerful, but unable to resolve the current situation.

Moreover, the characteristics of this land are not natural, which has ruled out his ability to use the "Soul Stone" spell afterwards.
This five-ring spell can only be used in natural soil and rocks like the Soul Stone, leaving no trace of excavation.

As Zhao Xu controlled the flight force and retreated backwards, he also took out a scroll case and performed a spell.
"Phantom Body!"
Divine Seven-Ring Spell.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's entire body and equipment transformed into a phantom body, and he immediately disappeared into the spiritual realm, making everything around him hazy, and gravity also disappeared.
He couldn't touch, observe, or traverse solid objects, including living beings.
Moreover, he could still see and hear the real main material plane, and he was in an extremely advantageous position.

When the old witch transformed into a phantom and fled, Zhao Xu had already lost track of the opponent.

"Trickster, you wizards, can only use such low-level tricks?" a mocking voice jeered from the void.
Here is the translation:

"The Display Method."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt as if he had been kicked in the leg, and his entire being was dragged back to the physical plane from the spiritual realm!

Are you a mage or am I a mage?
Two large question marks popped up in Zhao Xu's mind.

This cold and mysterious four-ring spell, which he almost couldn't recall, was experienced by him under the hands of a being suspected to be a "living fossil".
