Chapter 66: Countermeasures

"That's fine," said Wang Congwei, and she directly grasped the pearl in her hand, slowly allowing the magical energy to recover. The pearl, which had lost its luster, gradually regained its original brightness.

It took until the next day for the pearl to fully recover its energy. After recovering her magical abilities, Wang Congwei's complexion also turned slightly redder. She directly walked in front of Zhao Xu and handed him the "Recovery Pearl".

"This is too valuable, a reward of recovering one magical ability is enough," she said, before slowly backing away from Zhao Xu until they reached a suitable distance for the battle.

At the same time, Wang Congwei took off the silver necklace with a shining pendant from around her neck and put it in her pocket.

The players around them, except for a few ambitious ones, all quickly backed away. From the first day of their training, they had been warned that if they used their magic to attack their comrades without permission, they would be expelled from the Floating City. This was also the reason why everyone was excited to see a battle between two magicians tonight.

"Looks like you're really afraid of hurting me," said Anzhi Noya's voice, which had been approved by Zhao Xu and entered his mind.

"Yes?" Zhao Xu replied.

"That necklace she's wearing can increase the level of a spellcaster by one level," Anzhi Noya explained.

"Can it be used to increase the level of a spellcaster by one level?" Wang Congwei realized that she was intentionally reducing her magic bullet damage, but Zhao Xu was still astonished by this ritual.

"Yes, my intelligence hat has been blessed with this ritual," Anzhi Noya said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's heart suddenly couldn't help but complain, "Teacher, why don't you just give me a boost directly? I'm not very good at bringing out this Aria stone." 

"I'll give you a ritual, and you won't be able to estimate its value. But I'll give you a similar effect Aria stone, and you'll know what's going on, and you'll be grateful to me." Anzhi Noya gave Zhao Xu a subtle smile.

Zhao Xu almost let out a cry.

However, he noticed that Wang Qingwei had already stood up, ready to wait for his declaration to begin.

Zhao Xu only reacted to realize that he still didn't know what to do, and he hastily called out to Anzhi Noya.

"Teacher, what do I need to do?"

"Oh, you just acted so confidently a moment ago, I thought you had it all figured out."

"Anzhi Noya, you're going to kill me."

"Well, get ready to cast a spell. Just figure out the opponent's spell and cast a similar one to cancel it out. That's it."

"Is that it?" Zhao Xu didn't understand the logic behind it at all.

"If you can kill him, I'll give you another magical equipment. Now, start!" Anzhi Noya said directly.

The people around suddenly felt a sense of tension in their hearts, and many were uneasy due to the magical equipment.

A large circle had already attracted a lot of attention, and several managers were staring in this direction from afar.

The entire underground plaza's stone floor was so bright that it could reflect Zhao Xu's silhouette.

Wang Qingwei had entered a different state at this moment, her eyes focused intently on Zhao Xu as she began to chant incantations.

Zhao Xu had already deciphered the opponent's incantations, and he didn't need to listen to know that Wang Qingwei was about to release the "Magic Missile".
Here is the translation of the text:

Magic Missile 1D4+1 damage (2-5) could not even scratch King Congwei after she removed her necklace. However, Zhao Xū was unable to do anything about it, and all he could do was stare at his character information panel.

He realized that the spell was ineffective and that he needed the system's recognition and connection to the magic source to be useful. It wasn't until King Congwei finished speaking that the Magic Missile began to charge.

King Congwei's expression showed a hint of surprise.

She had originally thought that Zhao Xū was about to cast a shield spell to block her Magic Missile in a high-stakes battle situation. However, to her surprise, no shield appeared in front of Zhao Xū.

Most mages in Mistral have a minimum intelligence of 16, which means they won't have too many attributes left over for their physique. Unless, of course, they're a first-day 32-point starter.

As King Congwei's thoughts turned this way, she directly changed her target.

Zhao Xū didn't panic, but he didn't feel any pain when the Magic Missile hit him either.

The feeling of impending doom was crushing his heart and eroding his will. Suddenly, he felt the residual strength in his body surge back.

The magic field formed a connection between the source and him once more, and Zhao Xū seized the opportunity.

"Uh?"
"What's going on?"
"How is this possible?"
The audience erupted in shock.

King Congwei was equally astonished, staring at the Magic Missile that had already disappeared from her palm.

Before the bird had even left a trail in the sky, it had vanished.

Along with it, Anzhi and Zhao Xū also disappeared.

The only thing left floating in the air was a "Level 1 Magic Recovery Pearl" slowly falling to the ground.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As he finally fell into Wang Qingwei's hands, he landed on the spot where the original magic missile was condensed.

...The night sky of the floating city was quite desolate, with many towers around still shining with lights.

However, from the highest vantage point of the floating city, which occupied a large area of the view, the starry sky and the three-quarter moon, full of mysterious power, were still the main attraction.

The air was filled with the scent of rain, although they couldn't break through the barrier of the floating city, providing some moisture to this land.

"What just happened?" Zhao Xu suddenly felt a blank in his mind, and the "magic missile" spell prepared by An Ti Nia disappeared.

"You know," he said with a hint of speculation.

"It's so annoying that you people are so clear in your hearts, yet you still want others to congratulate you again."

Zhao Xu was already accustomed to his teacher's straightforward language and didn't feel anything unusual.

After receiving confirmation from An Ti Nia, it meant that he had also learned another ability of a mage.

The "anti-magic" spell, which was successful in identifying and countering magic, could absorb the same amount of preparation magic and cancel out the opponent's magic.

This meant that he would soon be leaving the floating city.

"As long as I have the same spell, can I cancel out the opponent's spell?" Zhao Xu confirmed with An Ti Nia.

"No, anti-magic is very strong and can cancel out someone else's spell, but if used poorly, it will only make things worse."

In this world, there was no such thing as having so many identical prepared spells.

"What if there's no way to compensate?" Zhao Xu asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

The book barely touches on this topic, as if it's not very willing to discuss the methods of this mage battle.

"Ah, specializing."
"That's it?"
"That's it."
When Zhao Xu heard this, he began to imagine the scene where he was in front of a mage who couldn't cast spells.

Suddenly, he thought of another weakness of spell reflection, and hurriedly asked:

"Teacher, spell reflection can only be used once. What if two mages release spells at the same time? Is there any way to compensate?"

"Ah, specializing."
"That's it?"
"That's not possible."
Zhao Xu was taken aback.

"Why?"
"This requires legendary specialization."
