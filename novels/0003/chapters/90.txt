Chapter 091: Locking in the Target

Maple Leaf was thinking in his mind that even the first-level spell "Enchantment of Humanity" could only increase affection, and he had never heard of it making NPCs generously hand over their wealth.

There are usually several forms of adventure teams. One is the long-term team form, where equipment is distributed as needed. Another is the temporary team form, where equipment is auctioned off individually, with the highest bidder getting it and others sharing the auction gold. The third form is the hired team form, where Loa is paid a salary, weapons, and various consumable items, and all the gains belong to Loa, unless otherwise agreed upon.

Even if Zhao Xu puts in a lot of effort, he can be compensated afterwards, or even take a share of the gains. However, he won't be allowed to choose beforehand.

The Starlight Underground Force can thrive in the Stormwind City under the leadership of the Merchant Alliance, and even possibly rise to become a partner of the Alliance. It's not just about martial arts.

Isis has never wronged anyone who has helped her. This sentence Maple Leaf heard when he completed his warrior training in Stormwind City, and Rainbow experienced it during his wanderer graduation trial.

The four of them are all clear about Isis's power in the entire Stormwind City.

So after hearing that this task was Isis's order, they were willing to participate.

However, Zhao Xu somehow made Loa think that there was a mighty force behind him?

Maple Leaf felt a bit tense, hoping that Zhao Xu could leave after taking his gains before Loa woke up to realize there was no force behind him.

Meanwhile, Loa was sweating nervously, grateful that he hadn't done anything to offend the present spellcaster.
Here is the translation of the text:

It is clear to everyone in the underground organization that a law-enforcement officer is unable to move, unless they have another law-enforcer to conceal or resist on their behalf. Even the most covert assassination cannot escape the prediction and magic of law-enforcers, which is a lesson summarized in blood and tears by the underground organization.

In a gang battle, Luo Ya and his party were already in a dominant position, when a high-level law-enforcer's relative suddenly appeared and demanded the return of the power share Luo Ya had gained. Even afterwards, the leader, Yi Si, had to smile and hand over another share.

This is the deterrent power of the Arthurian law-enforcers.

"Don't be dazed," Zhao Xu noticed the fourth spell "Vampire's Touch" being nullified after falling on the boundary. At this moment, the four spells have finally completed, and the next round is the cannon's charge and storage time, which is also their opportunity.

"Everyone, move to the back, except for Mr. Luo Ya, who will stand at the left edge of the corridor and stick to the magical boundary, but don't go out," Zhao Xu instructed before taking up a position to the right.

"Remember to pull me in when the fireball is launched," Zhao Xu bound the rope he had just pulled and handed the other end to the people standing at the back.

At this moment, he is the closest person to the curse cannon from a positional standpoint.

The curse cannon always locks onto a target each time, and just after Luo Ya passed through the pit, he stood at the front and raised his shield to protect them, so the curse cannon was triggered first.

Luo Ya also became the target locked by the curse cannon's first to fourth spells, and the fireball was shot directly at his initial position.
Here is the translation of the text:

Generally speaking, after the fireball technique lands, the flames directly cover a range of 7 meters. It's impossible for ordinary people to quickly move away from this distance, so only Zhao Xu's spell shield can resist it, allowing Luo Ya and the others to escape danger.

As the fifth round of silence came to an end, time stepped into the sixth round. The curse script tower began to condense its energy again, and another fireball was brewing in the mouth of the devil's head sculpture.

"Be careful," Zhao Xu warned.

Just as the fireball was released from the tower's mouth, Zhao Xu was suddenly pulled back by everyone's intense pulling.

However, the trajectory of the fireball did not target him, but instead flew straight at Luo Ya.

As the fireball approached, even though Luo Ya was standing behind a protective barrier, he still couldn't help but take a step back.

No matter how hot the fireball was, it immediately turned into nothingness when it touched the shield, as if it had never existed.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

However, in an instant, a massive wave of flames erupted outside the spherical shield.

Countless fiery flames directly covered the field of vision in front of them, burning the surrounding air.

"The fireball technique hasn't disappeared," Zhao Xu explained calmly. "It's just that it's ineffective within the shield's range."

Then Zhao Xu turned to Luo Ya and said, "I was afraid the spell would block the curse script tower's recognition, so I intentionally stepped out and got closer. However, the curse script tower's spell still locked onto you, which means you were the target from the very beginning. Unless you move at least 40 meters away from the curse script tower, you will remain locked as a target."

As everyone looked puzzled, Zhao Xu knew they still didn't understand. He pointed to the far end and said, "So, as long as Luo Ya stays here, if someone rushes to the tower, he won't become the target of the curse script tower."
Here is the translation of the text:

"As long as Luo Ya doesn't leave or die," Zhao Xu said with a smile, "we should send someone to scout ahead and see what's around the corner. If the path is safe, Luo Ya can then sprint over to grab the fifth interval of time. We'll understand the situation and make a decision."

The team finally understood Zhao Xu's plan.

"I'll go scout ahead," Maple Leaf said, stepping forward.

Zhao Xu looked at Maple Leaf and said, "Your physical condition is damaged, and your skills are affected too. Don't bother coming along. Someone with higher agility skills should go."

"I will," Rainbow said, standing up.

Seeing Rainbow volunteer, Zhao Xu nodded slightly and whispered a few words in his ear before patting his shoulder and sending him off.

Zhao Xu's "Invalid Spell Boundary" can last for 20 rounds, which is fortunate because the original version of the protection staff is only level 13 and would run out of time quickly.

Rainbow knew time was urgent and didn't dare to dawdle, quickly making his way forward.

Zhao Xu sent Rainbow, who has high agility skills, to scout ahead, which was also to make him face the trap again and take a risk to get through.

Fortunately, there were no more traps along the corridor, and Rainbow smoothly reached the end.

At this point, he was standing under the curse tower below the demon sculpture's head, with a slight sweat on his forehead. After lighting a fire to illuminate the road ahead, he couldn't help but laugh.

The road ahead was also a long corridor over 100 meters long, although the risk was unknown, but it was enough to give them a 40-meter safe distance from the cannon.

"A safe distance of 40 meters," Rainbow called out after a while.

At this time, the time had just reached the ninth round, and the fourth spell had disappeared from the boundary.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Codename is Rainbow, you guys charge forward," Zhao Xu continued to arrange. "Everyone is stunned, Zhao Xu quickly yelled, 'Hurry up, rush forward 7 meters, and then you can take your time outside the fireball range.'"

At this moment, the team members rushed forward in a hurry towards the corridor.
