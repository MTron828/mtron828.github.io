Chapter 059: Reading Magic
The next day, Zhao Xu got up early, finished preparing his magic, and arrived at the "Knowledge Library" in the floating city before dawn. This library is a popular destination for mages who want to improve their knowledge and skills, with over a dozen bookshelves divided into categories corresponding to different knowledge and skills.

The library is very large, but most mages prefer to find a quiet corner to sit and read, looking like they're not disturbing anyone. Since yesterday, Zhao Xu has been diligently reading according to Anniya's requirements, setting his skill orientation on the character card and focusing on reading.

When he finally finishes reading all the knowledge and skills at the 1st level, he can leave. This is something that Zhao Xu can't help but be surprised about when he hears Anniya's words. Even though knowledge and skills are a kind of divine technique in adventure, he can't resist reading so much.

After upgrading his knowledge and skills, he can search for related information on the information panel. By passing a test, he can obtain partial information, depending on his skill level.

It's equivalent to a academic search engine like Google Scholar. However, many warriors still won't invest in knowledge skills. Each profession has its own specialized skills, and knowledge is a mage's specialty. He can exchange 1 skill point for a 1st-level skill. However, for warriors, knowledge is a cross-profession skill, requiring 2 skill points to upgrade to the 1st level, which is a double-edged sword.

Zhao Xu had just cast a zero-level spell "Reading Magic" and immediately opened the mysterious book he had borrowed, reading it with relish, cherishing every second. This was something he had complained about countless times yesterday.

The authors of these popular science books on mysticism just couldn't use simple, common language to write. They had to use magical script with encryption, as if they couldn't emphasize their wizardry identity otherwise.

Zhao Xu's knowledge (mysticism) skills and spell recognition skills were all zero-level, and it was risky to read mysticism books without preparation. Therefore, he could only use the "Reading Magic" spell to decode the text.

As a result, his reading efficiency was extremely low, and he could only maintain a reading speed of about one minute per page. The duration of the "Reading Magic" spell was 10 minutes per caster level. As a 1st-level wizard, Zhao Xu's caster level was only 1, which meant he could only maintain the spell for 10 minutes.

After using up the two-hour reading time, he would have to switch to a slower reading method. Many spell effects were determined by the caster level.

If Zhao Xu waited until he became a 2nd-level wizard, he would be able to maintain the "Reading Magic" spell for 20 minutes, which would be much more convenient.

The library's transparent glass ceiling and the many eternal magic lamps surrounding him seemed to be mocking him, as his 17-point intelligence attribute was still unrealized. He was constantly struggling to stay awake while reading these mysticism classics.

Compared to learning spells, the motivation for upgrading knowledge and skills was much lower.

This was also the reason why few players would gather in the library, as most would congregate at the spellcasting hall instead.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu saw An Ti Nuo Ya holding a book with mysterious symbols on its cover, sitting across from him. Zhao Xu was taken aback and asked, "Teacher, are you also reading a book?"

Although Zhao Xu had never seen An Ti Nuo Ya's true face, he could only recognize him through the faint outline of his features under the dim light.

However, after spending some time together, Zhao Xu could still recognize An Ti Nuo Ya even if he changed his clothes.

"I still have some skill points left, so I'll use them up by reading this book," An Ti Nuo Ya said carelessly, flipping through the pages of the book in his hand.

The book cover had three warning stickers attached to it. The day before, An Ti Nuo Ya had been warned by the administrator not to read books with warning stickers.

The number of warning stickers on the book An Ti Nuo Ya was holding was probably only accessible to legendary-level individuals.

"What's going on, teacher?" Zhao Xu wondered.

An Ti Nuo Ya glanced at Zhao Xu and said, "You don't know?"

"What don't I know?" Zhao Xu looked around to make sure there were no people around.

In a public place like the floating city, most of the surveillance systems were disabled, making it difficult to eavesdrop.

"This isn't a secret," An Ti Nuo Ya said. "It's just that you want to become a legendary mage, and there are requirements for knowledge of the mysterious arts. This also determines the number of legendary spells you can cast."

"What requirements?" Zhao Xu's ears perked up.

"Can you cast a level 9 spell?" An Ti Nuo Ya asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head. "Not yet."

"Why are you asking so many questions?" An Ti Nuo Ya asked.

"It's not a secret, right?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It's not a secret for a 20th-level mage, but it is for someone like you, a 1st-level mage."

When he heard this, Zhao Xu directly returned to his mysterious books and began to read.

However, after discovering that it was connected to the legendary mage, the magical words in the book became much more vivid.

As he read each sentence, he felt that the "legendary mage's progress bar" behind him was constantly displaying "experience +1".

Ten minutes later, the "reading magic" that had been cast on Zhao Xu's body officially came to an end.

The originally gentle and affectionate magical words suddenly changed into a complex pattern, and his eyes couldn't focus.

Zhao Xu quickly closed the book and was about to pick up the transparent crystal on the desk to cast the "reading magic" again.

He suddenly remembered that Anzhiya, the legendary mage, seemed to have never cast any spells.

As a legendary mage, Anzhiya must have over 20 levels.

Wouldn't she be able to cast a zero-level spell, "reading magic", for 200 minutes, that is, 3-4 hours?

Zhao Xu hurriedly approached Anzhiya and said, "Let's discuss this."

"Go ahead," Anzhiya looked at the book with a good mood.

"Can you, teacher, release a 'reading magic' for me?"

"I'm sure you can continue for 4 hours, while I can only continue for 10 minutes, which is too short. How about we compromise? It's just a zero-level spell slot," Zhao Xu hoped to ask.

Anzhiya turned her head back and looked at Zhao Xu.

"You're not familiar with the 'spell extension' specialized skill that allows you to continue for 20 minutes."

Zhao Xu could only look at the other person with a helpless expression.

"Oh, I didn't mention it to you yesterday, so you shouldn't randomly combine this specialized skill."

"It's okay, since I'm going to teach you the remaining specialized skills, let's do it together later," Anzhiya said.
However, I have to tell you a few things. Anzha continued to say.

"I haven't prepared the 'Reading Magic' spell today."

"That means you don't need the ability to read magic?" Zhao Xu was suddenly puzzled.

"No, I have already stabilized this spell."

(Note: "恒定" is a verb that means to stabilize or to consolidate, in this context, it refers to the spell being stabilized, meaning it's no longer unstable or prone to failure.)
