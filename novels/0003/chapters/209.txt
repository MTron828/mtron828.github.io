Chapter 210 Negative Energy Combo
The spell "Pre-sight of Fortune" itself is a spell with a duration of 1 minute per caster level, and it will only be activated when Zhao Xu decides to use the spell's effect.
It is equivalent to giving Zhao Xu two chances to try, and then taking the best one.
Although it may also fail, it invisibly flattens the entire probability curve.
Attacks, skills, saves, and attributes basically cover the four most common types of checks for adventurers.
Usually, even an experienced person would worry about a moment when the horse stumbles. Especially for an adventurer, once stumbled, it means death.
But for Zhao Xu, who has this spell, it's different.
Whenever he casts this spell, if his check "performance evaluation" is still "1st level", then he will only be unlucky to have both times be at the 1st level.
This is equivalent to reducing the probability of the worst level 1 performance from one in twenty to nearly one in four hundred.
At the same time, the probability of the best level 20 performance is raised from one in twenty to one in ten.
Once, Zhao Xu used the bard's arcane "Immediate Cooperation" to overturn the current check result and check again.
The principle is different, but it is equally domineering.
It is also from these spells that the mage slowly embarked on the path of manipulating fate.
The starting point of the battle between the two sides is no longer limited to just the amount of numbers, and has even reached the level of involving the world's mechanisms.
As Zhao Xu thought about this, he walked towards the bright light at the entrance of the passage.
As he walked to the end, he finally saw the breathtaking view ahead of the new entrance.

From his current position on the high platform, he looked down and saw a vast graveyard filled with numerous skeletons, with bones scattered all over the ground, resembling a newly excavated cemetery.

In the middle of the graveyard, there were hundreds of skeletal warriors, their eyeballs glowing with a fiery flame as if their souls were burning. The skeletons held iron shields and curved swords, patrolling continuously, preparing to hunt down any living being that appeared.

However, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on a stone monument beside him, inscribed with a cryptic religious text. Zhao Xu didn't find it too complicated, so he directly used his religious knowledge to decipher the meaning.

After successfully connecting the dots, Zhao Xu's expression turned puzzled as he read the content. It mentioned that, opposite the high platform, there was another platform that could be reached by climbing down a rope hanging from the graveyard below.

After climbing up the platform, he would enter a tunnel that led to the "Carrion Cave" in the half-plane. However, to activate the portal, he needed a customized key. The key was hidden among the countless bones in the graveyard.

So, he had to risk being chased by undead creatures and endure the unpleasantness of searching through the bones to find the portal key.

This was just the appetizer before reaching the half-plane. However, Zhao Xu understood that to achieve "Steel Will" expertise and gain a +2 bonus to his willpower, he had to demonstrate exceptional determination and perseverance.
According to what Luo Duo said, that half plane is the incarnation of the resentment of the god of death, so it's understandable that the test involves undead creatures. In his previous life, Zhao Xu experienced many battlefields of corpses and blood, so he didn't feel much about these dried-up skeletons. The main problem is that the text mentions that the square below has a negative energy field. It's similar to when Zhao Xu used to shoot down the skeleton warriors in the power test field. If one arrow doesn't kill them, the skeletons will be rapidly healed and restored to full health under the effect of the "negative energy field." Arthur has six inner planes, including the elemental planes of earth, air, fire, water, and positive and negative energy planes. The square below has an interface to the negative energy plane, and the energy that permeates from that plane can continuously heal these skeletons. The six-ring divine art "Harm Art" that Zhao Xu obtained from the underground shrine's fighting cabinet is the purest form of negative energy. Even severely wounded undead creatures can be revived and restored to their original state by Zhao Xu using the "Serious Injury Art." This negative energy is healing for the undead creatures, but it is harmful to Zhao Xu. The strength of the negative energy is maintained at about 10 points per round. At this moment, Zhao Xu has reached level 4, and his HP has only increased from 18HP to 23HP. Even if the skeletons don't attack him, he can't stand for more than 3 rounds. Finding the key is not something that can be done in just a few tries. At this moment, Zhao Xu looks at the dozens of undead creatures and thinks slowly. Even if these undead creatures die, they will be revived and summoned back under the effect of the energy field in the next round, so he doesn't plan to eliminate them.
Here is the translation of the text:

Thanks to the fact that he is a mage, even if a warrior came here, no matter how strong they are, they would still be bothered by the constant 10-point damage every round. Unless he has enough life points and sufficient healing methods. With the high-value "Healing Belt" in Queen Wei's hand, which provides 40 HP of healing every three rounds.

However, Zhao Xu didn't seem too anxious after some thought. Although his single- or two-ring spells have limited strength, he can still come up with many variations with sufficient support. Just like how he can cast spells to resist fire elemental damage, he can also cast the two-ring spell "Protect from Negative Energy" to counter negative energy.

No matter how much negative energy he receives, Zhao Xu can absorb 10 HP of damage every round, and the spell itself can last for 10 minutes per caster level, adding up to nearly an hour of usage.

Then he combined his Invisibility Ring with some trash talk, which can also work under the noses of the undead creatures. However, Zhao Xu didn't plan to use this spell.

In the final round in the final space, he learned all the two-ring spells, from arcane to divine, and naturally understood how to deal with undead creatures. This is also where Zhao Xu's strength lies - he has more options.

Moreover, thanks to his multi-talented caster and precognition, he can utilize these options and won't be stuck with a bunch of useless spells. That's the two-ring spell "Undead Shroud"!

At this moment, Zhao Xu took out some bone fragments from his backpack, which were obtained from the destroyed undead creatures.
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, dust can also be used, and even Zhao Xu can take materials directly from the scene. However, Zhao Xu is so meticulous about learning the skill "Exempt Materials" that he has to carry various materials with him at all times, or be prepared to cast the "Summoning Material" spell at any moment.

On the other hand, other players who don't have a few skills will only have a few materials to choose from, making it easy to spot.

After completing the spell, a faint white glow envelops Zhao Xu's body.

The flashes of light continue to bombard Zhao Xu's body, instantly turning his physical body pale and ancient-looking, before returning to its normal state.

Zhao Xu immediately performs a leap of faith.

As he's suspended in mid-air, he hastily recites the incantation "Feather Falling"!

Suddenly, his entire body becomes weightless, and gravity only takes effect for a brief moment before losing its impact.

His speed is comparable to jumping from a one-meter platform, with a certain velocity, but eventually, he falls to the ground at a constant speed.

Although he emits a dull sound, the rebound effect is insufficient to cause him harm.

After the sound resonates, only the nearby undead skeletons with no intelligence or hearing turn their heads to look at Zhao Xu before continuing to drag their curved swords forward.

Zhao Xu also lets out a sigh of relief.

This proves that his spell has no problems.

【Adventurer Zhongxia is affected by the "Undead Cloak" and gains rapid healing 10】
Immediately, his dynamic panel flashes with this prompt.

This is the power of the spell, which wraps Zhao Xu in an invisible negative energy shield, causing unintelligent undead creatures like skeletons to regard Zhao Xu as one of their own.
At the same time, Zhao Xu's body has been affected by the magic, and during the nearly one-hour duration of the magic, he will be considered as an undead creature. Healing magic will harm him, while damaging magic will heal him, completely reversing the effects. So, because of the presence of negative energy, he will receive 10 points of rapid healing, equivalent to receiving 10HP of healing every round. Suddenly, Zhao Xu's whole body felt a stronger surge of negative energy, tightly enveloping and pressing against him. "Adventurer Zhongxia, you are affected by 'causing minor injury', 'causing moderate injury', 'causing severe injury', 'causing fatal injury', 'severe injury spell', current status normal." This message suddenly appeared, causing Zhao Xu to tremble. He cursed the stone tablet in his heart, almost dying here. In addition to his own negative energy field, there are also hidden special magic attack methods here! Once a creature enters the field, they will receive a series of damaging spells. However, before he could reflect on this, he suddenly felt a special force approaching from behind.
