Chapter 506: Anniya's Half-Face

"Buy."
Facing Anniya's inquiry, Zhao Xu did not hesitate at all.
Even if Anniya asked him to send something, he would do it just like that.
After all, Zhao Xu's mind was not thinking about putting things into his pocket unless it was truly his.
But once something was put into his pocket, unless it was Anniya, the white dragon would demand it back, and he would have to see who had the hardest fist among men.

"Very good."
Anniya couldn't help but let out a clear, silver-bell-like laugh, and the white dragon, which had been so fearful just a moment ago, looked somewhat dazed and didn't even notice.

"Do you know how you would handle people coming from elsewhere, Zhongxue?"

"I would use the ban on teleportation, such as the Interstice Domain," Zhao Xu replied.

However, the Interstice Domain spell he couldn't cast right now.

"The Interstice Domain's effective range is too small, you can't cover this area," Anniya explained.

"In fact, you just need to move everything here in an instant," she said, snapping her fingers lightly.

As she did so, the interior of the snowy mountain body, which had been accumulating snow for years, was suddenly emptied, and the surrounding area became a dreamlike scene, like a fleeting shadow.

The wall above, where the treasure chest had been moved, began to shimmer with lapis lazuli colors, flashing with a flowing light.

In the end, all these strange phenomena slowly faded away, revealing the true scenery of the surrounding area.

"Wow."
"What is this place?"
Saint Warrior Vivian took off her helmet, revealing her shoulder-length hair.
Here is the translation of the text:

After spending some time in the snowy world, I suddenly found myself in front of a lush, verdant green plain, surrounded by the sweet songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers. Everyone seemed a bit disoriented.

At that moment, Anniya was sitting on a swing suspended from a giant ancient tree, her bare feet resting on the woven seat. She was gently swaying back and forth.

"Welcome to one of my created half-planes, summer," she said, revealing her true face and gazing at the few people before her. "Usually, I prepare my spells here, completing a standardized daily routine and preparing various spells to be cast behind me before I leave."

"So, the time here is slowed down by a factor of one hundred times faster than the outside world, so you don't need to worry about changes in the outside world," she added.

Zhao Xu was too preoccupied to watch the vast treasure that had accompanied them.

He looked around at the world with a mixture of curiosity and wonder, even gazing at the distant white herons flying overhead, with smoke rising from chimneys as if someone was actually living there.

However, Anniya had to prepare her spells, so she teleported to her own half-plane.

She had deliberately created a world that looked very relaxing and comfortable.

"Ah, the legendary spell 'Creation'?" Zhao Xu tried to ask the Emperor, using a gold plow.

"This legendary spell is actually a small problem," the Emperor replied. "The main thing is to stabilize it and integrate various energy systems to make this world come alive. That's much harder."

"After all, this world is heading towards chaos and disorder," he added.

As Anniya's gaze deepened, she looked at Zhao Xu, her eyes filled with concern. "Without external intervention, everything will eventually decay."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're legendary, and I can teach you about this spell and subsequent plans," Anzhi said with great interest.

It seemed that the legendary mages she had met before were all like worthless stones.

"That's it, let's do it," Zhao Xu said with a faint smile.

"Alright, I just used the legendary spell to teleport all of you, including the live creatures, over here. This time, I'll take responsibility for our actions," Anzhi said with a smug tone.

As expected, Zhao Xu thought to himself that Anzhi had been flaunting her legendary spell lately.

Just then, the white dragon beside him began to shiver.

Anzhi proudly raised her chin, "Hmph, legendary spells are child's play."

"I can make you take the treasure without any consequences, and even Duke Carlo won't know it's us who did it. This is my true ability," Anzhi said with a sly grin.

She then cast her gaze at the pile of treasure in front of Zhao Xu.

"Teacher, divide it up," Zhao Xu said.

But Anzhi just raised an eyebrow slightly and remained silent.

"This...," he finally realized why Ernest could gather all the treasure of the Magic Empire, having a disciple like Anzhi who was so gifted. It was no wonder that the "Lost Heritage" of the Itzel Kingdom had been preserved for a thousand years, with Anzhi, the true owner, keeping it safe.

"Take everything out of the dimensional bag," Zhao Xu ordered.

"This old man has never encountered an opponent as formidable as you," White Dragon Serus said, wrinkling his brow, and directly dumped the magical items from the dimensional bag.

Under Anzhi's threat, he also secretly pulled out one magical weapon after another, a total of over ten items, and dumped them out.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You... are also staring at the actions of this White Dragon in awe.

It's true that just a moment ago, you glanced at the White Dragon from time to time, but this White Dragon can actually hide things secretly.

'Next time, I'll make you, this greedy dragon, pay for it. I'm really stupid,' Zhao Xu couldn't help but say.

However, this time the White Dragon also felt a sense of guilt and embarrassment, and looked down with a sheepish expression.

'Ning Zhong, didn't you just use that legendary technique? Didn't you take these artworks for a pretty penny?' An Ti Nuo Ya said with a sparkling eye.

Zhao Xu was also a bit stupid at this time.

It was as if he had seen An Ti Nuo Ya fall from her pedestal.

She gave him not just tens of millions of gold coins, but also showed interest in hundreds of millions of gold coins.

But it's no wonder that An Ti Nuo Ya needs to explain herself, as she has taken responsibility for this.

'That teacher, except for the artworks left over, I'll take everything,' Zhao Xu asked.

'No,' An Ti Nuo Ya replied, waving her hand.

The White Dragon beside him also quietly approached, 'You use your charm to entangle her, and then I'll secretly use a dimensional bag to store things, and we'll divide the remaining nine parts. How's that?' The White Dragon even showed a pained expression.

'Ah,' Zhao Xu finally couldn't take the absurdity of this White Dragon and secretly punched it.

Everything is his, and with his and An Ti Nuo Ya's relationship, it's like exchanging left for right.

He's eaten his fill and is now full, and wants to divide the rest with this White Dragon? Moreover, he's the least of the nine parts?"
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Anniya seems to be very pleased, "Zhou Xia, it's because this is my treasure room. You see, when you were studying at Mistral, I also gave you a few treasures before."
"Back then, you were poor and couldn't afford to buy anything, but now you don't have capital anymore. How about using the treasures here to offset the price?"
"Honestly, the magic items in Duka's treasure room are there, but the ones that are truly useful are the ones they've equipped themselves with. Most of the magic items are of low quality.
Now, it's hard for Anniya to give him the "purchase list".
Then, Zhao Xu will also arrive at the peak of his strength.
At least, before, he didn't need to worry too much about his equipment issues.
At this time, Zhao Xu is silently thinking about his needs, thinking about how to maximize his vision.
Meanwhile, Anniya is getting lively, "Do you want some advice?"
"What?"
"You didn't use the 'wish spell' to increase your intelligence by 5 points, did you?" Anniya said.
"No, I didn't," Zhao Xu replied, still stunned.
Now, everyone basically knows that each 1 point of attribute value is extremely rare.
So, the extra 4 points of talent granted at the first registration the next day is extremely valuable.
Even relying on equipment, because of the non-overlapping effect, even if you wear a bunch of strength-enhancing equipment, it will only increase the effectiveness of the strongest item.
"So, the benefits are now generous."
Here is the translation of the text:

Anzhi Noya suddenly suspended the six shape-shifting magic tomes in mid-air, each with a unique appearance. "These are all one-time magic items that can increase internal attributes. Once you finish reading the book, you'll lose the power, and they're all the strongest +5 version. Reading one book is equivalent to consecutively casting five 'attribute +1' spells."

Anzhi Noya introduced, "However, the internal increase limit is 5 points, which you've already obtained through prayer. Reading the 'Quiet Thoughts' manual is pointless, and you can only keep it to give to someone else."

At this point, Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a deep breath as he gazed at these "manuals" that could drive players crazy. "Teacher, how much do these things cost?"

"13,500 gold coins, no bargaining," Anzhi Noya said with a sly smile.

"Wait for the future or choose now, it's up to you, Zhongxia," Anzhi Noya continued to tempt him.

It seemed like she was hinting that he couldn't afford it or was being taken advantage of.

Undeniably, Zhao Xu was 9th level when he didn't need to pay for spells, and the same went for prayer. However, he wanted to cast a prayer that could increase intelligence, which he wouldn't be able to do until he reached 17th level.

After some thought, Zhao Xu finally opened his mouth and said, "Teacher, can you give me two of each?"

From the next day on, he became a man with multiple attributes, with a total of over 25 points.
