Chapter 676: The Power of Debuff Spells

In reality, when a warrior of average build, approximately 1.8 meters tall, fights a giant, three-meter-tall ogre, the height difference can cause significant psychological pressure. It's as if a grown adult were fighting a student.

As a result, the "Transformation" spell, which is a minute-level skill, is considered a crucial ability for warriors.
Although this transformation process reduces defense and attack power by one level and agility by two points, it is difficult to resist the advantage brought by the increased strength and ability to wield large weapons.

On the other hand, the key skill "Divine Favor" (one level, attack damage +1-3 luck) and "Divine Power" (four levels, strength +6, attack equivalent to level) can only be used on oneself, so Zhao Xu cannot transfer the spell to others before reaching the 4th level of spellcasting ability.

Unless he gives the spell to someone else and has them activate it, which is the only way non-casters can enjoy the benefits of these spells.

These ogres, lacking a mature alchemy system, usually only use "Giant Axe" skills, while ordinary ogres often only have a large wooden club that costs 5 gold coins. According to the warrior's association damage curve table, this club deals 1-8 points of damage. Human wielded medium-sized clubs can deal 1-10 points of damage, while ogres wielding large clubs can deal 2-16 points of damage.

At the same time, these giant wooden clubs held by both hands are usually adorned with nails, needles, iron rings, or wrapped in iron plates, and in terms of intimidation, they are no less impressive than a hammerhead. Zheng Xin'an was also feeling an unparalleled sense of trepidation as he watched the battlefield, where blood and flesh were flying, and the sounds of clashing armor and iron nails were echoing.

Just the embedded needles alone could cause a player to be instantly killed if they were to be touched carelessly. Therefore, while there are still many players who choose to play the warrior, in reality, very few players actually take this path. Most mages are old-fashioned and straightforward in their approach, using their powerful life force to heal wounds and restore health. However, Zhao Xuan would not be so cruel, and he had a secret plan.

As soon as Zheng Xin'an entered the battlefield, she instantly became the primary target for these evil creatures, which were born with a tendency to destroy beautiful things.

Finally, when Zhao Xuan activated the "Sacrificial Blessing" with his supernatural ability, a misty aura burst forth, swirling upwards in a spiral motion, as if a dragon was sucking up water. The blessing, imbued with faith, caused Zheng Xin'an's character panel to display a new data:

* Damage reduction: 20%
* Resistance to fire, acid, electric, cold, and sonic energy: 15%
* Magic resistance: 43%

This effect far exceeded that of a typical three-ring spell, and the duration was a staggering 33 hours, making it a high-level spell, not a low-level one.

"Captain!"

At this moment, Yu'er's face lit up with surprise as she turned to gaze at Zhao Xu, clearly she had not expected to receive such a generous gift.

However, Zhao Xu just shrugged his shoulders and said, "Look behind you."

Just as Yu'er was distracted for a moment, her back of the head was hit by a giant wooden club, almost sending her tumbling into the depths of the earth.

She fell to the ground in a sprawling position.

Luckily, the light of the law instantaneously negated this damage.

Players can quickly level up by relying on the "Revival" means, repeatedly taking losses and learning from their mistakes, and then growing up as Arthur.

Other ordinary Arthur residents, without the blessing of the Revival Stone, would naturally return to the heavenly realm with their souls.

"Pay attention!" Zhao Xu shouted, thinking to himself that he knew it would be a disaster if he didn't give Yu'er this spell first.

Yu'er also quickly got up from the ground, looked down sheepishly, and then turned around to join the battle.

Zhao Xu's "Sacrificial Hymn" spell, which had three layers, was based on the consumption of 250 gold coins, 1000 gold coins, and 10,000 gold coins to obtain different effects.

The lowest 250 gold coins only provided a 5/10 magical damage reduction effect and 10 points of energy resistance, with magic resistance equal to the caster's level.

As Zhao Xu was under the ability "Supernatural Spell", naturally he chose the most expensive "10,000 gold coins" tier.

Instantly, Yu'er felt the 20/10 magical damage reduction effect of this level.

At this level, no one could buy magic weapons without money, naturally couldn't deal more than 20 points of damage, and couldn't penetrate Yu'er's defense.
Here is the translation:

Like the renowned "Stone Skin" spell in the four-ring system, which allows for a 10% reduction in damage taken in exchange for 250 gold coins, but only up to a maximum of 150 points of damage. However, Zhao Xu did not take it lightly.

He had already noticed that the Allowance was being attacked by several level 3 giants at the same time, and was showing signs of being overwhelmed. Occasionally, some giants with explosive damage would leave shallow wounds on the Allowance.

Zhao Xu glanced at these giants and immediately activated his "Super Magical Control" ability - the "Flash of Malice" spell.

This four-ring change spell, which only requires verbal components, has a duration of one round but can ignore resistance and only targets a single individual. However, it can only affect spells that target a single individual at a distance.

Therefore, it cannot be combined with healing spells, but it does fit the situation perfectly.

Immediately, Zhao Xu selected an additional 20 extra targets, and the spell enveloped the group of giants around the Allowance. The giants suddenly felt a strange sensation, as if they were about to disappear from the main material plane at any moment, just like an airplane taking off and landing suddenly.

Just as one of the giants, a wild man, failed to make progress, he suddenly went berserk, grasped his massive axe, and swung it with all his might, as if he was about to split the mountains and rivers.

Even if the Allowance was wearing armor with a defense level of +7, it would not be able to withstand this attack.

One misstep would mean certain death.

Just as the wild man was about to complete his attack, his silhouette and axe disappeared, and he was forcibly pulled to the edge of the spiritual realm, completely losing his influence over the main material plane.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the other 20 flesh-eating demons surrounding them were going to meet the same fate. They swung their weapons to attack, but would suddenly appear and disappear, making it seem like they were completely invisible to their targets.

Their hit rate was immediately reduced by 50%!

However, Xiao Er's iron ball continued to hit without missing, and the battlefield was soon covered in blood.

Malice flash technique.

The attack rate was 50% for them, but 100% for the attacked.

This was a real malice.

Moreover, due to their brief disappearance, they were unable to complete their soul transfer in the spirit realm and therefore could not teleport through walls in the real world.

"What's going on?"

"Who is this?"

"What lowly creature is hiding around?"

The flesh-eating demons roared in giant language, brandishing their giant wooden clubs as if they were about to vent their anger at being hit and then disappearing. However, they only managed to disappear by another meter or two, missing their attacks.

However, Zhao Xu, who was enraged, had already used the "Advanced Invisibility Technique" of the four rings, hiding himself away.

This technique was more powerful than the "Invisibility Technique" of the two rings, and even if he attacked, he would not disappear.

Zhao Xu's original intention was to give Xiao Er a buff, but he suddenly got excited and poured out a drop of sugar syrup as a spell material - Slow Technique!

Compared to Malice Flash, Slow Technique could affect up to three targets of the same level, making it a kind of group Debuff.

As for the "Acceleration Technique", it was a powerful positive buff, and the reputation of Slow Technique was no weaker.

The 30 demons closest to Xiao Er suddenly realized that their movement and attack speeds had become extremely slow. Originally, they could complete their attack and retreat in one go, but now they could only do one thing in one turn.

At the same time, they all realized that their dash and jump distances had decreased by at least half.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's as if we've been cursed by a turtle. "There's a wizard here, he's the companion of the one who just came," at this moment, a savage man-eating demon finally came to his senses, shouting with rage, "Scatter quickly, this woman is strange, let the wizard come."

However, the army of man-eating demons led by the demon wizard had already rushed to the front lines of the battlefield with the double-winged dragon, completely unaware that a commotion had erupted behind them.

As for the iron hammer in Li Ru's hand, it could cause both "blunt" and "pierce" types of damage.

However, its power was still too small, and even when man-eating demons could be replaced at any time, Li Ru was still unable to knock down a single one.

Zhao Xu then used his mental link to communicate with Li Ru:

"Li Ru, don't you remember that you're in the domain of war?"

"Yes, team leader," Li Ru nodded immediately.

After getting up from the battlefield, Li Ru's combat instincts slowly recovered, and he began to enjoy the thrill of battle, relentlessly chasing after the man-eating demons who couldn't dodge.

It was just like playing the old game of beating a mole.

"What are you not using military weapons?" Zhao Xu was puzzled.

Priests are skilled in all simple weapons, and compared to wizards, they are more likely to use "iron hammers" like this.

However, the divine ability of the "domain of war" is to make priests skilled in divine and military weapons, and gain corresponding weapon expertise.

Li Ru suddenly puffed out his mouth, "To begin with, my corresponding weapon is a long sword, who knew that after coming into contact with the existence of that dead god, it would suddenly turn into a giant sickle."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The long sword was originally around 3-4 pounds, but suddenly it turned into a massive scythe weighing 10 pounds, which is quite cumbersome, so I won't use it anymore."

"...Ah..."

The scythe girl Zheng Yun'er, isn't this nickname uncool?

Indeed, she was pampered too much by him, and even a 10-pound weapon seemed too heavy. How could she wear a suit of armor weighing less than 20 pounds without flinching?

However, Zhao Xu didn't say much.

In the end, it's still his responsibility.

Initially, the camp's cleric had no restrictions, and the "domains" they could choose from were very extensive. From a pure combat strength perspective, the camp's cleric was better.

However, Zhao Xu chose the "War Domain" which was suitable for his natural talent.

Who would have thought that Zhao Xu used divine fragments to approach Yun'er, naturally changing her inclination.

The weapon used by the god of death at that time was the "Scythe of the God of Death", which was now in his hand, "Heavenly Paradise".

However, now that Heavenly Paradise had returned to its original form, Yun'er should also change back to her original specialty.

Zhao Xu immediately cast the spell "Higher Magic Weapon" on the long sword in his hand, then casually tossed it, sending a mental message, "Catch it, and get rid of that hammer."

At this moment, Heavenly Paradise was suspended in mid-air, waiting for Yun'er to grasp it.

"What's this weapon, Brother Zhongxia?"

At that moment, Yun'er felt that her "specialty" and "specialized long sword" had both lit up, and the long sword was sending waves of heat to her.

She felt that her small hand was getting hot and couldn't hold it.

"+5 Unwavering Flowing Frenzy Sword"."

Zhao Xu's cut was quite good, and he could recite the full name of the long sword in under two seconds.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's this?" Allow allowed a stunned expression.

"Use your mental abilities, and the password is 'handsome summer brother.' Then, it can change your physical form,"

"...".

Allow felt embarrassed, but still muttered the password, which was an actual phrase.

Zhao Xu then gave a silent order to the long sword, which changed its form.

The mental abilities themselves added 5000 gold coins, not just a simple "+1" or "+2" increase. They could make weapons change from "microscopic" to "enormous".

Zhao Xu had tried to transform into a toothpick-like shape to clean his teeth, but it almost woke up the spirit of the Heavenly Realm and got scolded.

This seemingly ordinary "mental ability" could change in countless ways, just like a Golden Cudgel.

In an instant, the "medium-sized" long sword transformed into a "large" one.

But it didn't stop there; it continued to grow, becoming "enormous".

"Ah?" Allow was taken aback.

"Don't just stand there, a single-handed weapon can be upgraded to a larger size, becoming a two-handed weapon," Zhao Xu said.

For example, a medium-sized human could wield a large long sword with one hand or a medium-sized long sword and a small shield with one hand.

The original 1-8 (1D8) damage of the medium-sized long sword suddenly transformed into 3-18 (3D6) damage of the enormous long sword, making it a deadly weapon.

At this point, Allow began to swing the sword effortlessly, taking down the rebellious demonic beasts.

What was once only capable of piercing wounds now could cut off an arm.

Not only did Allow enjoy wielding the sword, but Zhao Xu also nodded in approval in silence.
As expected, a high-grade weapon significantly enhances the damage curve, which is why many warriors are willing to risk their lives to acquire a "Brave Gauntlet".

With this magical item, one can use weapons as if they were one level higher than normal biological beings.

However, even with this, the speed of cutting vegetables is still relatively slow. At this moment, Zhao Xu is gazing at the distant border, it seems that the cavalry team and the player adventurer have not gained any advantages.

Apparently, he needs to lend a helping hand.
