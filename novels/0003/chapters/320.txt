Chapter 321: Encountering the Masses

The next morning, Zhao Xu prepared himself in his scholar attire and stood in the central street of Mistral, gazing at the crowd of people streaming by.

He was dressed in a high-collared woolen coat, with crisp, ironed shirts and a tie. He also carried a cane, which would be perfect if he had a butler. Zhao Xu's first stop was the academic department of Mistral's academy, where he would be teaching.

The specific arrangement of this stop made Zhao Xu feel that there must be some secrets hidden within the academy. Therefore, he would investigate the information about Andy, who had once been here, and also prepare for battle.

For him, it was impossible to give up his own defense just to disguise himself. He would directly use the "Transformation Technique" and "Shape-shifting Technique" to disguise himself.

If he went to teach as a wizard, his identity and status as a wizard in Mistral would make everyone show him respect. This way, he would see fewer truths.

This would also mean that Zhao Xu had lost the intention to deeply interact with people of all levels.

When the clock tower rang out the tenth bell, the entire central street began to appear, with players from Arthur's login appearing one by one.

Many people carefully examined their surroundings, confirming that it was indeed Mistral, the familiar world they had logged out of yesterday. They let out a sigh of relief.

From the posts on the forum last night, many people had worried that when they logged back in, the entire world of Arthur would have undergone significant changes, and even time might have passed multiple years.
Here is the translation of the text:

The native residents of Mistral looked at the suddenly appearing player projections, seemingly unimpressed. They thought it was just that today's events had unfolded in a more organized manner.

At this moment, Zhao Xu, who was leaning on his staff, also heard the discussion among the players who had appeared beside him. "Oh, it's good that it's still the familiar Mistral," a cleric player exclaimed, patting his chest and making a prayer gesture towards the city center's Holy Heart Cathedral, as if it had become a habit for him in the game.

Meanwhile, a female player who was familiar with the cleric, who was located in the city of the goddess, looked at him with excitement and asked, "Do you think the online player could be in Mistral?"

Zhao Xu reacted immediately after hearing this term. He had forgotten about the login interface of the game, which displayed the number of online players, because he had rushed to log in after meeting Zheng Xin'an last night.

As a result, he was the only one online, naturally attracting a lot of attention.

However, Zhao Xu didn't think much of it, as long as he didn't acknowledge it, no one could prove a thing.

The cleric player, on the other hand, didn't take his companion's words seriously, saying, "Perhaps a warrior who has discovered the location of the witch's treasure box could create a miracle and eliminate the witch."

"But the wizard's association and the gods' church have too many leaders above, and there's no way they would leave room for someone to create a miracle."

The cleric player's implication was that the online player was unlikely to be a wizard or cleric.

This line of reasoning suddenly made the female player realize something.
Here is the translation:

She also didn't expect her companion to be so perceptive, "Ah, Brother Qiu, I didn't see this kind of statement on the forum. It's your own thought." Meanwhile, the pastor shook his head modestly, "Although it's my idea, after experiencing the strength of the Mage Association and the Church of the Gods, it's clear to any spellcaster that this is the case. We didn't need to mention it explicitly last night. Therefore, the subsequent rumors about that player being Dong Cheng Xiaoye came to nothing."

As the main character, Zhao Xu, was also a bit embarrassed. The player who was online at the time, a mage, happened to be standing right in front of them. At this moment, numerous players who had successfully logged in were discussing this topic. If Zhao Xu approached the player at this time, he would probably hear similar conversations.

The brief exchange of words between the two also reminded Zhao Xu of the controversy on the forum the night before. He directly stopped a rickshaw and sat down, instructing the driver about the destination. Zhao Xu was clear that the pastor was right; a legendary warrior was stronger in terms of attack, life, and combat skills compared to a level 1 warrior. He was simply more "fight-worthy".

However, a legendary mage was stronger than a level 1 mage by an entire era of magical civilization. He could turn the impossible into possible, so he would never leave any gaps in history for the other side to exploit. As the two players watched a scholar with a cane and noble bearing sit down in the rickshaw, they didn't react too strongly and continued discussing their opinions. Rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages were still the preferred mode of transportation for the upper class in each town.
Here is the translation of the text:

In general, people in the city mostly prefer to walk, but when they go out to the countryside, they may have to take a horse-drawn carriage. Those who can afford to hire a horse-drawn carriage are usually wealthy merchants or nobles who can afford to pay for the horse-drawn carriage expenses. Those who are middle-class may choose to rent a horse-drawn carriage. Those who are even more impoverished may choose to hire a human-powered rickshaw. After walking for over twenty minutes, Zhao Xiu finally arrived at the Civil Affairs College, where he tipped the rickshaw puller with two copper coins, which was even higher than the market price. The rickshaw puller was thrilled, as the extra earnings would improve his family's dinner that night. As Zhao Xiu turned to leave, the rickshaw puller kept looking at him. "What's wrong?" Zhao Xiu, who was holding an "overdrive" (a fictional device), pretended to be a nobleman who couldn't inherit his title and was forced to take the civil service route. Seeing the rickshaw puller's innocent gaze, Zhao Xiu thought he had let his guard down and couldn't help but ask. The rickshaw puller, taken aback by Zhao Xiu's question, felt embarrassed and explained, "No, no, sir, I just thought you didn't look like the nobles outside."
Here is the translation of the text:

"How did you figure it out?" Zhao Xu was taken aback when he hadn't even stepped inside yet and had already let his guard down.

"The look in your eyes, looking at us, doesn't seem like the condescending gaze of the nobility or the pitying gaze of an academic, but rather the gaze of a colleague looking at someone who does different work," the coach said, as if realizing he had said something wrong and quickly covering his mouth.

Zhao Xu immediately understood and smiled, saying, "Thank you for the reminder. It's true that referring to others' behavior can help us find areas for self-improvement."

The coach's words had awakened Zhao Xu, and even the dusty old memories had loosened up a bit.

He had indeed brought the habits of Earth to the Arthurian world, which would become a hindrance or a help at some point.

Zhao Xu immediately handed over a silver coin with a mark to the coach as a token of gratitude.

He gave away a thousand gold coins, but it would only harm the other person, so Zhao Xu chose a balance.

However, even a silver coin that was insignificant to Zhao Xu made the coach jump in surprise, hesitating for a moment before taking it.

But Zhao Xu had honed his skills, and with a flick of his hand, he popped the silver coin into the other person's pocket.

Then, he turned around and walked towards the entrance of the Ministry of Culture, his original warm and friendly demeanor replaced by a different aura.

At first glance, it seemed contradictory, with a sense of familiarity from years of friendship and a sense of distance that kept people at arm's length.

It was as if he had become a god-like figure, like a divine statue.

After registering at the entrance of the Ministry of Culture, Zhao Xu followed the staff to the dean's office.
As the important talent reserve institution of the Mistral administrative system, the Textile Academy has a prestigious reputation. Many "apprentice" spellcasters who failed to become official wizards and priests have entered the academy to prepare for a career in the bureaucracy before joining the system.

The Textile Academy is located in a prime area of Mistral, occupying a large plot of land with over 10 buildings and a spacious auditorium that can accommodate hundreds of people. The city hall often borrows this auditorium for events.

After waiting for about 10 minutes, Zhao Xun was led to the dean's office, where he met the highest-ranking leader of the academy. However, Zhao Xun was surprised to find that the dean was a middle-aged man with a stern face, who looked like someone with a strong sense of justice. The dean's mustache, which was neatly trimmed, added to his dignified appearance.

What caught Zhao Xun's attention was the badge on the dean's chest, featuring three concentric circles. This was the same badge worn by the same three-ring wizard who was once the vice president of the Moonlight Town Wizarding Association and a "wizard apprentice".

The dean, M端ller, seemed to be unaware of Zhao Xun's true identity and introduced himself with a simple and courteous tone. After a brief conversation, M端ller handed Zhao Xun a thick stack of documents.

"Mr. Zhongxia, you will be responsible for leading a class of 30 students, with 25 from the Arther Kingdom and 5 from Earth," M端ller said with a hint of seriousness.

"This is a rather tricky class," M端ller said with a deep smile as Zhao Xun took the thick stack of documents.
