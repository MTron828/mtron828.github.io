Chapter 586: Ernest!

As soon as Zhao Xu's words left his mouth, it was clear that the little girl in front of him was still unable to understand what was happening at this moment.

She was staring blankly at the big brother who had just made the evil dragon disappear.

Zhao Xu smiled and reacted after a moment.

In the past, when Ernest met May in the prehistoric era, he had already become a shepherdess. It was clear that the dragon's invasion of the small town had made May lose her parents' reliance.

Under such conditions, where there was no reliance on parents and the family's property had been burned to ashes, it was already very difficult for May to grow up into a girl through herding sheep.

In fact, the historical May had not met Zhao Xu, and it was very likely that she had been knocked unconscious by the dragon's dive and spew, and was fortunate not to have died.

Zhao Xu sighed when he saw this scene.

Even a strong warrior like May, who had once stood at the peak of Arthur, had a fragile and unwilling past that he did not want to remember.

However, Zhao Xu's thought was interrupted by another suspicion - why did he see the original May in Anzhi Noya's memory line?

Where is Anzhi Noya in reality?

According to reason, May's appearance as a six-year-old or less should still be seven or eight years old before she meets the rumored Ernest.

That is also the key time node when Ernest appears in Arthur's legend.

Therefore, many ancient historians who specialize in ancient esoteric history and theology have proposed a hypothesis - that is, Ernest is a powerful wizard from another "heavenly" universe.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, the other party had transferred an enormous amount of magical knowledge that was impossible for one person to complete. Before Ernest, Arthur had already had magic, but the knowledge was not systematic and was scattered without taking shape.

Therefore, Ernest the Great was not the inventor of magic. Strictly speaking, magic itself was an imitation of the abilities of powerful mythological beings. This is also the reason why many spells and incantations in today's magic are based on the Dragon Language.

However, after Ernest appeared, he supplemented a large number of spells and even sorted out the eight major schools of magic. He gave magic a position similar to creating a language.

Instantly, Zhao Xu connected with Anzhiya, who became a legendary mage at the age of 20. Logically, she became a legendary mage after touching Ernest's magic within a short period of 10-odd years. It is very possible that the other party had not yet been born at that time.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu unfolded his palm and clenched his fist towards the void!

Suddenly, the arcane energy burst forth, and then it was like the goddess scattering flowers, surrounding Zhao Xu's entire body.

The four-ring spell "Biological Location"!
The intangible exploration ring pushed outward in all directions, and Zhao Xu slowly turned his body towards the direction of Arthur's current location.

As long as Anzhiya is within the range of the spell, he can successfully sense the presence of the other party at the moment he faces them.

This spell material is a hunting dog's fur spell, which can locate a specific biological group or even a specific individual, as long as the caster has observed the other party from close range. However, Zhao Xu, who had been in close proximity to Anzhiya for several months, did not encounter any feedback from the spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ainonoja is not in this world.

Or, to say, she is being protected by a spell that predicts and prevents detection, such as "avoidance detection" or "transformation" or "illusion", which can deceive this spell.

Even flowing water can obstruct the effect of the spell, so if Ainonoja is swimming in the stream at this moment, Zhao Xu can't do anything about it.

However, since Zhao Xu has already made a preliminary judgment, he doesn't care. He slightly stands up and looks up at the distance.

The sun's rays on the lake's surface are like a transparent mirror, and the already harvested wheat field is like a serene and beautiful garden, emitting a golden glow. The mountains in the distance are shrouded in a mysterious haze, and the clouds in the sky are intertwined and spread out in all directions, like a silk fabric.

All of this contrasts sharply with the blazing flames burning in the small town ahead, where the fields of golden wheat are piled up, and the air seems to be mourning. With the collapse of the buildings, the earth also starts to shake and tremble, and the town's bridge collapses, becoming a ruin.

Zhao Xu witnessed the tragic history of the May Lady's family being destroyed and her people being killed.

So he can also wait for the May Lady's life-changing history to unfold.

Although he doesn't understand why he entered this world, it's possible that Ainonoja has not yet been born.

But he doesn't care.

Magic is like the wind, accompanying him wherever he goes, and he is fearless in any world.

Thinking about it, Zhao Xu slightly bends down and says to the little girl, "May, I'm sorry, but I have to go to the future to see what happened, and I can't stay here to witness your growth."
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, he gently adjusted the minute hand on his wristwatch. Instantly, everything around him seemed to move forward rapidly, like a fast-forwarding video. The ruins of the small town in front of him gradually disappeared, and the rubble was cleared away. New buildings, foundations, and houses began to rise again. Over a period of ten years, Zhao Xu witnessed the rebirth of this town that had been destroyed in history.

During this process, he observed everything, including the fact that May's family's farmland was sold due to the betrayal of the family's servants. Eventually, the farm was taken over by a childless couple living outside the town. When the couple had a child, May's living standards in the family began to decline, from rice porridge to black hard bread, and annual new clothes were no longer received.

May, who had helped her adoptive mother with needlework for the town's wealthy families, also began to help the rancher with sheep herding. In a few years, May would be given to the rancher's 40-year-old dairy worker as his wife, all for a few gold coins as a dowry.

Zhao Xu watched all this unfold with an iron heart, afraid to miss the arrival of Ernest, and even hesitated to use his wristwatch to skip time. He silently observed everything, like a statue. During this period, Zhao Xu lived in a nearby hill covered with green grass, with his "Eagle Eye" technique constantly monitoring the area where May would graze the sheep, like a closed-circuit television.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu was quietly sitting in a wooden house on top of an oak tree near the forest, where he would often lounge on a hammock tied to a branch. As he thought deeply about the mysteries of magic, he would observe his surroundings.

As he touched the tree, Zhao Xu could use his unique Druidic ability, "Forest's Eye," to see the scenery around any oak tree, no matter the distance. It was as if he was watching from beside the selected plant.

This spell was more secure and would not disturb various detection spells. However, since May was not protected by magic at the moment, Zhao Xu observed her more directly using his "Divination" spell.

Even Zhao Xu, who often used his abilities, didn't bother to use supernatural magic to save material costs. His shoes were already filled with the eyes of hawks, and he had sprinkled sulfur, copper powder, and zinc powder inside.

In his treehouse, there was also a 1.2-meter-tall, highly polished silver mirror. Once the spell was complete, the mirror would display the three-meter details of May's surroundings.

If a priest used this spell, they would need to use at least 100 gold coins of holy water in a silver bowl to watch. As for Druids, they would use natural water to watch.

The "Divination" spell could allow Zhao Xu to see and hear the specified creatures, but only if the targeted consciousness waived the exemption. However, May had not had the possibility of waiving the exemption before Zhao Xu.

Especially, Zhao Xu understood the level of the person being affected and whether he had the person's property, which would affect the difficulty of waiving the exemption. If he knew nothing, the difficulty would definitely decrease by 10 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some second-hand information, such as having heard from someone else, would result in a 5-grade decrease; direct information, such as having seen it with one's own eyes, would have no effect. As for familiar-level information, it would be a 5-grade difficulty.

Even pictures could increase the level by 2 grades, having someone's belongings or clothes could increase it by 4 grades, and having a body part such as hair or nails could increase it by 10 grades.

Therefore, the practitioners of King Arthur, who actually pay close attention to the residual effects and leftover materials, will be constantly monitored by others if they leave a trace. It's like there's no protection against premonitions.

Zhao Xu, who has almost become numb, is routine monitoring the sheep-herding process on May 1st using a silver mirror.

The four-ring secret art has already been spread out by him, doing directional patrol work.

As for the area where May 1st is less present, he has used the "Peeping Eye" secret art of the five-ring "Gaze" to lay down over 30 half-real magic balls.

These balls follow his instructions to patrol, and as soon as they encounter a specified condition, they will immediately return to report to him.

However, today seems to be a peaceful day, and May 1st has driven the sheep flock to the north-facing slope of the hill early in the morning, repeating the daily routine of work.

May 1st, who has grown up for over a decade, has seen the ups and downs of the world and is aware that beauty can be a curse to oneself. Therefore, she rarely takes care of her appearance and always looks dull, which makes her even more unpopular.

At this time, May 1st is repeatedly driving the sheep, and Zhao Xu is also repeatedly watching her do so.

Even when the sun sets, May 1st will drive the sheep back to the sheep pen, and Zhao Xu will signal the next day's dawn.

On one hand, this long and tedious wait is tormenting Zhao Xu's inner self.
On the other hand, he had a feeling that Ernest's arrival in Arthur's day was not far off, so he basically couldn't miss any shots every month.

Suddenly, the silver mirror's flashing white light passed through the scene of yesterday's painting.

Zhou Xu's eyes immediately felt a stabbing pain, and he couldn't help but cry.

Is he blind?

Zhou Xu's mind flashed this thought, although he couldn't imagine what kind of impact it would be to make himself blind on the other side of the mirror, but he didn't care at all. He immediately started to take measures to save himself.

"Remove blindness!"

The wide-range removal of negative buffs, which was quietly waiting in the three-ring divine list, was a spell that could remove various diseases.

As a result, once a priest reached the three-ring level, they could become an excellent doctor, relying on removing diseases to heal all diseases.

In an instant, the gentle recovery energy beam pierced through Zhou Xu's "touch" and continuously penetrated into his eyelids, causing the previously painful sensation to gradually disappear.

The removal of blindness and the removal of deafness had the same effect, but it could not restore sight to the blind, but it could remove damaged parts.

Zhou Xu's vision suddenly recovered, and the surrounding light curtain was projected back into his eyeballs, allowing him to clearly see everything around him.

The originally clear and transparent mirror appeared with a snowflake-like crack, accompanied by a "ding-ding-ding" sound.

The shadow of May in the mirror also shattered into countless small pieces.

"Boom!"

The thunderous thunder-like sound suddenly erupted, shaking Zhou Xu's eardrums like an earthquake, almost prompting him to apply the removal of deafness spell to himself again.

What had happened?

Was it the gods descending from heaven?

Zhou Xu's inner heart was constantly screaming.

Because when he looked up, the entire sky had turned dark, as if the twilight phase had been directly jumped over.
Here is the translation:

Meanwhile, the wind kept howling and whipping around, causing the one on the tree top to sway precariously, and the illusion covering the small hut had already been dispelled.

Suddenly, a series of mysterious whispers echoed through the surroundings, sounding as if they were coming from a desolate mountain valley, and harmonizing with the thunderous voice in the sky.

In this mountainous region, enveloped in the darkness of night, the atmosphere was filled with an air of unease.

"Teleportation!"

Even the cautious Zhao Xu at this moment couldn't help but suppress his inner turmoil and curiosity, and immediately activated the teleportation, heading straight for the place he had discovered was May's location.

Within a second, the post-teleportation discomfort and familiar bodily sensations gradually returned to Zhao Xu's body.

Zhao Xu appeared in front of May, who was standing on the mountainous terrain where she was herding sheep.

The sheep had already been startled by the previous thunderous sound and were all cowering on the ground, unable to move.

Moreover, despite having a difficult and arduous life, May, who had always maintained a noble and pure heart, was now lying on the ground, as if she were kissing the earth.

However, the surrounding creatures all knew that she was kneeling down to worship the king who had descended upon this world.

Zhao Xu also slightly lifted his head, mustering all his courage to try to gaze upon the man, who was destined to leave a chapter in the history of Arthurian magic, exceeding a fifth of the book - Ernest.
