Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the man who stood up. Compared to the luxurious clothing of most people present, the man was also wearing a large and simple outer robe in this winter, covering his somewhat thin figure, but also standing out from the people around him.
Even the poorest of the five wizard players could still match the adventurer's set given by Arthur's deluxe edition.
Zhao Xu also noticed that the man was one of the few who did not secretly sneer.
Apart from the five absentees, Zhao Xu remembered the expressions of the remaining twenty-five people from just now until now, thanks to the effects of his enhanced intelligence.
He especially noticed the apologetic tone of the man, which was very calm, as if he were standing up to recite something.
It was not the kind of insincere apology with a hint of resentment, nor the kind of worried apology out of fear of severe consequences.
It was as if he had resigned himself to it, standing up, reciting, and then accepting the punishment.
Seeing this scene, Zhao Xu also understood.
It turned out that this class of thirty people had also formed a strict enough society.
And the seemingly indifferent and handsome student standing up meant that he was the scapegoat chosen by the "class" organization.
After recalling the man's name from the data, Zhao Xu silently stood still for more than ten seconds, until someone started to wonder, then Zhao Xu gestured for the man to come forward.
But as he looked at the restless students, he directly said, "If you have nothing to do, sit here quietly, otherwise there will be another spell later."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xun waved his hand with a blank scroll, an intangible pressure fell silent on everyone in the room. For a moment, no one could grasp the depths of Zhao Xun's hand, which was as tough as a few hundred gold coins. Everyone was cautious in their dealings with him.

After Zhao Xun gave his instructions, the student who was cold and distant remained silent for a moment before following him out of the room and into the next classroom.

"Are you really not being bullied?" Zhao Xun asked the student, whose name was Elliot, looking at him.

Zhao Xun had already memorized the class roster, including the brief introductions of each student, as well as the family backgrounds and the relationships between each student. Even the special requests made by Mister Stra or Pastor Stra, not to mention the great figures who had entrusted them with important tasks, were all clear to him.

Usually, people who are bullied tend to have a weak aura and often walk with their heads down. However, Zhao Xun saw something different in Elliot - a sense of detachment from life and death. Even a player with five resurrection stones in a game would not have such a mentality.

"Mhm, I've just admitted it," Elliot said, slightly lowering his head and speaking softly, unwilling to look Zhao Xun straight in the eye.

Zhao Xun immediately regained the mental state of the novice warrior he had once taught. Seeing Elliot's uncooperative attitude, he began to "attack" him directly, saying, "You look like someone who's been bullied to the point of being blackmailed? Come on, tell me."

However, Elliot, with his black hair and pale face due to malnutrition, remained silent and did not respond directly to Zhao Xun's question.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xia was also only able to let out a faint smile, and he didn't expect that he would one day become a dedicated counselor, engaging in persuasive conversations.

Unfortunately, he didn't have any good options, otherwise, he wouldn't be wasting his time here.

Looking at Elliot alone in front of him, he could see the anxious atmosphere emanating from him, combined with his already handsome facial features. In their underfunded university, it was only possible to earn the right to change girlfriends once a week by relying on one's physical appearance and temperament.

"You think the group of people who are relying on their ancestors' legacies to live off their parents in the neighboring class can help you take revenge? Even they can't become wizards, let alone help you."

Suddenly, Zhou Xia's tone began to take on a sharp edge, slowly piercing Elliot's heart, and causing his face to flush slightly.

"How do you know I want to take revenge?" Elliot said, his voice trembling slightly, "The school's student records won't publish such information. It's not something that shines. The secretary of the dean is just new, and she may have heard about it, but she doesn't know the details."

"Besides, she's talking to you, and I'm someone with no value, completely unworthy of being mentioned."

As Elliot deeply gazed at Zhou Xia, his tone was slightly high-pitched.

He couldn't help but notice that this man, who was currently leaning on his cane, seemed to be waiting for the afternoon tea date. Because, no matter how you looked at it, this man was very similar to a scholar who was born into a noble family and received a good education.

So, the man's decisive attitude had created a huge contrast, making it easy to shock everyone. When honest people fight with their lives, they will become even more ruthless.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Suddenly, Elyton thought of some noble families' strange hobbies and connected them to their current situation of being stuck in a classroom together, causing a shiver to run down his spine.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu looked at Elyton, who was recalling his painful memories, and was calm and analytical in his thinking, nodding slightly and showing understanding. Elyton was a wizard from a mage family in Mistral, and he had finally become a mage in his third generation, meeting the minimum standards set by Mistral for the mage family.

However, it was also that year that Elyton's family was brutally murdered. His grandfather, grandmother, father, and older brother, all of whom were mages, totaling three people, and seven or eight servants, were all killed. On that day, Elyton and his mother happened to be visiting his mother's family, narrowly avoiding the tragedy and subsequently becoming an orphan with his mother.

Knowing the circumstances of that year, Zhao Xu looked at Elyton without showing any sympathetic expression, saying, "You know, the major cities in Aethereia collect local information every year and feed it back to 'Knowledge Origin.' Cases like the brutal murder of your family, local knowledge, and historical knowledge can be found by tracing the connections."

At this point, Zhao Xu did not acknowledge that his knowledge check had failed.

However, as a 1st-level ability of "Scholarship" in the Cleric job, he could search for some local legends and secret information like a wandering bard.

At this point, Zhao Xu already had many rich skills, and even if one failed, he could achieve his goal through another channel.

This was also the strong advantage of the dual-elite professionals, with two career paths, which also meant more possibilities.

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, Elyton's face turned red.
Here is the translation:

After realizing it wasn't as simple as that, he sighed and said, "Just relying on knowledge and skills alone can't accomplish these things, right?"

"Although it's a bit far-fetched, if your level is high enough, you can even retrieve the truth about some past events through knowledge and skills."

At this point, Elliot himself fell into thought, saying, "Can't magic achieve even more powerful effects?"

"Are you suggesting there's a hidden agenda behind those old events?" Zhao Xu subtly picked up on the tone in his opponent's words.

But Elliot avoided answering.

"While I haven't reviewed the archives, I can make a judgment based on the knowledge I've searched. But I can tell you responsibly that any murder case involving wizards, especially one that has formed a family-scale organization, is an absolute collaboration between the Mistral Department. Unless the Seven Titans intervene, no one can cover it up by themselves. You can still learn smoothly here, which means the case from that year has been conclusively settled. The motive may have other possibilities, but the fact that someone was murdered is an undeniable and irrefutable evidence. So the killer is absolutely the killer."

Zhao Xu spoke calmly, "If you think the killer from that year is someone else, I advise you not to waste your effort. After all, it's a one-in-a-million chance to fabricate such a thing, and even with your mentor's ability, you can't uncover it."

Zhao Xu's tone was confident at first, but he left a small opening at the end to avoid being proven wrong.

He believed that the Elliot in front of him was not the kind of stubborn fool who would shout "I'll investigate to the end!" without a care.

But Elliot shook his head directly and said, "I'm certain the killer is him."
After finishing speaking, he raised his eyes and looked at Zhao Xu with a longing gaze, "But I know I can't take revenge. When my mage assessment declared failure, I knew my path was cut off."
"Even if I rely on the sympathy and shelter of other mage families to enter here and receive the next level of 'tutor' professional training, I know that my revenge is hopeless. At level 16, I can only cast a few limited five-ring spells. How can I succeed in revenge with the 'tutor' profession that doesn't even have the ability to harm arcane arts!"
Eridon's voice carried a hint of crying.
"Hey hey, why are you crying, you big man?" Zhao Xu had no sympathy, if it was a girl crying, he could still comfort her a little.
But when Eridon heard Zhao Xu's sarcasm, he didn't get angry. He quickly wiped away his tears, as he had done for the past decade.
"Midsummer Mage, I know you are a mage, and you and those big shots in the Floating City give me the same dangerous feeling," Eridon said, panting with excitement.
"Just now, although you pretended to cast a spell with a scroll, I still saw it. You actually secretly touched the dust on the scroll first, this extra action should be some kind of spell material. And I heard them say that you cast the three-ring spell 'Rain, Snow, and Wind Storm', so you are a three-ring mage."
At this moment, Eridon suddenly stood up and bowed deeply to Zhao Xu, "If you can help me take revenge, I will sell my life to you."
Zhao Xu couldn't help but be surprised. It was a pity not to become a priest with such powers of observation and perception.
But it's not easy to become a priest with deep grievances. When one's own obsession conflicts with devotion to the gods, it often leads to uncontrollable developments.
"Revenge is something you have to do yourself. It's meaningless if someone else does it for you," Zhao Xu refused. 
Eridon, on the other hand, did not lift his head and continued to bow. "In this lifetime, I can only be a 'mentor.' With each passing day, the gap between me and my enemy grows larger. There is no hope left." 
Eridon gritted his teeth, refusing to let the tears fall from his eyes. 
Only when he reached a certain level of despair did he convince himself to accept this fact. 
Zhao Xu just smiled lightly, thinking to himself, why waste so much time talking to the other party if he's going to be so stubborn. 
In the spacious sewer of Mysteria, there were many unfortunate souls who could not see the light of day. 
"What if I could make you a wizard?"
