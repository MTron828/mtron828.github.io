Chapter 176: Deep Night Shadows

As Zhao Xu and the others continued on their journey, the trip was very calm until night fell. The three crescent moons slowly rose into the sky, and it was getting difficult to continue traveling. They finally stopped to set up camp.

This time, the new recruit from the floating city was sent to eliminate bandits. Most of them had never ventured out before. The stories about Arthur's wilderness were mostly based on online forums and descriptions from other Arthur wizards.

This time, they managed to get out, and everyone cleared a flat area. They piled up stones to form a furnace shape, and then lit it with flint and tinder from nearby withered branches. Suddenly, a warm bonfire appeared before them.

Although two players had to log off early, the remaining 18 people were still too crowded, so they divided into two groups and sat around each bonfire.

As players sat around the bonfire, they started chatting about their experiences, from the mysterious background of the floating city to the entire game's mystique. "What a shame we're too remote to join the main team," said a new recruit. "We've been delayed until today."

"Don't think that way," replied someone. "Maybe you weren't born in Mistral, and you haven't become a wizard yet."

"Not that bad," countered the original speaker.

"Who says not that bad?" Jiang Shan interjected from the corner. "Look at the conditions provided by Mistral. Even the wizard academy in the capital city can't compare. It's just that the test vouchers and lecture vouchers are too expensive. I hope I'll have some left over one day."

"What do you mean by powerful wizards?" Jiang Shan asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

Satre, a relatively lively player, said, "According to my understanding of the lectures I've attended, those high-level spells are very strong, saying nothing of destroying the heavens and earth, but with one against ten, it's more than enough."

Another player immediately countered, "With one against ten, that's what ordinary players would say, but you've been in Mistral for so long, and you're only saying this? You haven't even reached the level of understanding this yet."

Just then, the relatively quiet Lao Lei opened his mouth and said, "Based on my understanding of those high-level mages, I'm afraid you can flip ten and flip it again."

"Twenty?"

"100."

The other novice mages looked at him in surprise. After all, how could they compare to those one-level spells in their hands? Even the relatively outstanding "Seven-Colored Spray" was not a surefire tactic.

Zhao Xun, who was squatting in the corner, looked at the group of chatting mages with a strange expression.

Even the first-level mages who had graduated from the Magic Academy in Mistral did not have a clear understanding of their own profession's strength. It was no wonder that the number of mage players was so small.

Currently, players and adventurers in Mistral were not too busy with their tasks, so there were not many high-level mages to see.

Even when they saw mages casting spells that seemed to destroy the heavens and earth, they thought it was just a special effect unique to NPCs.

"Against a hundred with one," a player mage in a blue robe said with admiration, "Does TC really allow their game to reach this level?"

"Will warriors and barbarians not protest when the time comes? Even if it's true that mages are difficult to practice in the early stages."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, TC is still managing so many things, and look at all the protesting posts on the forum. Especially in cases where some players are being kidnapped and slaughtered like prisoners of war, and people delete the game to protest, but TC hasn't responded yet."

"It's as if this game isn't even theirs to manage."

"You're right, especially since it's a buyout game, and players can only make money by buying accounts and creating high-level characters. This is indeed opposite to TC's usual style."

"So, what do you think? Are we just living in a real world?"

Suddenly, Esvihi spoke up, sitting beside Wang Qingwei.

The fire pit was filled with joyful laughter, and people from another fire pit couldn't help but lean over to see what was going on.

"Moreover, a mage's strength is not just about a few spells. They can kill efficiently."

Esvihi suddenly spoke up, her expression serious. "You guys haven't discovered yet that the mage system, life value, skill bonuses, attack levels, and evasion levels are all controlled by numbers in this game."

"So, once a mage reaches a certain level, they can stack these numbers to an unimaginable extent. At that time, a high-level player will be able to attack a low-level player, but with their own numerical attributes, the high-level player will never take damage."

At this point, Zhao Xu nodded, finally saying something right.

Unfortunately, it was only that little bit.

It's as if the genius of the era is still limited by the imagination of this era.
Maybe Esvihi knows that mages have other aspects that can be expanded, especially flying spells and stealth spells, which are strategically significant.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, Esveil couldn't imagine that there existed spells like "Swift Explosion" that combined speed and action, as well as "Shield of Protection" that could deflect one attack, equivalent to conceptual defense.

As for defense, warriors were still striving for stronger armor, while mages had already transcended "stat-based defense" and reached "conceptual defense".

After chatting for over an hour, someone finally needed to log off, and Wang Qingshi suggested that everyone log off together and wait until tomorrow to log back on.

At that moment, no one was enthusiastic about setting up camp outside and spending the night, so everyone followed Wang Qingshi's suggestion and logged off.

Zhao Xu sighed and stood up.

Although it was unlikely to encounter any major risks after dawn, Zhao Xu felt that it was best for him to patrol the surrounding area and clear any potential risks before the new players arrived.

Anshino had only asked him to intervene when the new players were unable to defend against bandits, but he didn't say he couldn't intervene before encountering bandits.

Zhao Xu successfully completed the task, helping to clear the surroundings and not counting it as helping the players complete their task.

Zhao Xu then walked to the fire pit, gazing at the stone that was still hot from the extinguished flames. He couldn't help but shake his head.

Most people had logged off directly by the fire pit without even thinking about it.

It's not that it's impossible; at least, the fire pit needed to be extinguished before leaving.

Otherwise, with two stones still radiating heat, and the surrounding area deserted, anyone who passed by or had been secretly observing would know that a player had logged off.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If he has the intention to do so, with just a few more people, they can set up a large-scale trap around this area. Then, when these people go online the next day, they will fall into these traps one by one. Only Wang Qingwei and Eisweiss a few people will be able to consciously keep a distance from each other, avoiding a major incident. However, with Zhao Xu's presence, the problem is not that big. As long as he finds a good place to go offline and comes online early tomorrow to guard this area, there won't be any unexpected incidents.

At this moment, the entire sky is shrouded in a thick, dark night, and without a flashlight, it's impossible to see the details of anything more than a few meters away. Occasionally, animal cries can be heard in the night sky.

Zhao Xu didn't think much and directly took out some black gemstone powder from his backpack. This is the powder he helped Anzinoja grind from the black gemstones he helped her polish. The black gemstone powder is not worth much money, but it is a material for the first-level magic "Eye of Ebony".

Zhao Xu held the gemstone powder and gently applied it to his forehead, feeling the cool sensation of the powder as he began to chant the incantation. Suddenly, his forehead felt hot, and the powder directly disappeared, turning into pure energy that permeated his eyes.

The next moment, Zhao Xu opened his eyes again, and he directly obtained "Dark Vision". "Eye of Ebony" cannot expand Zhao Xu's field of vision, but it allows him to see through darkness, including the darkness created by magic.

If he had learned this spell earlier, he would have been able to see through the darkness created by Leyen's magic.

The scenery around the path became gray-white, and Zhao Xu could clearly see the outlines of the trees and grass."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu could only do so. If he didn't, the fire torch he was holding under the influence of the invisible art would be invisible, but the light source wouldn't. Others would see a bright light moving around, and the unknown ones would surely be terrified to death.

In general, people walking in the wilderness would feel uneasy, even with a lot of courage.

However, Zhao Xu had the invisible art on his body, and for other living beings, he was an even more terrifying existence.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu noticed a flash of shadow on a thicket of bushes, even with his dark vision, it was hard to accurately grasp.

Zhao Xu immediately took out the "Eternal Magic Wand of Fireball" and used it, as using it too little would make it expire.

He used it tonight, and he didn't feel any discomfort.

Including his entire set of magical skills.

Zhao Xu tightened his star-studded cloak and touched the pendant on his chest, reconfirming the effects of his equipment.

He took one step at a time, slowly approaching the dark shadow.
