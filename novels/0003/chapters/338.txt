Chapter 339: Transaction

The momentary pause in "Lei An"'s question sent a chill down Zhao Xu's spine, as if he was staring at a mirror in the dead of night and saw someone in the mirror doing something different from himself.

Zhao Xu directly activated his "mental link" communication ability, constantly conveying information to Lei An.

He needed to determine when Lei An was replaced.

Was it when he returned to the classroom?
Or just when he almost tripped on the elevator door?

This was crucial, as it concerned whether others knew about his predicament.

If the Lei An who returned to the classroom was a fake, Zhao Xu would be consumed by deep fear and might as well take his own life.

But if it happened just a moment ago, there was still hope.

After the feedback, Zhao Xu's mind received no response, and the fake person beside him didn't mock him for his foolishness.

This also eased his anxiety to some extent.

At that moment, the metal mirror surface surrounding the Golden Furnace, made of thick steel plates, faintly reflected their silhouettes.

However, Lei An, who was originally about the same height as Zhao Xu, seemed to have grown a pair of bat wings in the reflection, and the floor numbers on the control panel were stuck, no longer changing.

Zhao Xu didn't feel the sense of weightlessness that came with descending.

He and the being pretending to be "Lei An" were trapped in a sealed space.

Zhao Xu even doubted whether this place was the same Golden Furnace he had entered initially.
"Let me introduce myself first." The person next to Zhao Xu spoke with an elegant tone, "I have many titles, but for convenience, you can call me the immortal lord 'Grazt'."

At the sound of the last syllable, Zhao Xu felt a sense of familiarity the moment the other person spoke, confirming his suspicion.

He turned his head and saw that Lei An's originally unrestrained face had blurred into a different appearance, with angular features and a handsome, soul-piercing charm, exuding an irresistible dark allure.

Although his skin appeared somewhat dark, his eyes shone with a strange green light, and his sharp ears and prominent yellow fangs revealed his demonic identity.

"A projection?"

At this point, Zhao Xu remained calm.

He hadn't expected that the demon lord "Grazt," who had always wanted to conquer the other layers of the abyss and become the sole lord, would suddenly appear in the "Cathedral of the Sacred Heart" in Mistrala.

The initial "succubus priest" could still be considered a kind of private provocation.

Now, this kind of visit was a direct affront, enough to provoke a divine war.

Having already used the "time rewind talisman" and unable to teleport elsewhere, Zhao Xu pondered over at least ten different thoughts in his mind, but ultimately decided to feign submission to the abyss lord, rather than recklessly using the "super magic instant empowerment staff" to activate the "gaseous form" and gamble on whether he could escape through the alchemical elevator's "ventilation shaft."

"Heh, what does it matter?" Grazt suddenly spoke with a sinister tone, "Especially for you, right now."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You've sacrificed your beloved followers, the Sorceress, just to chat with me, didn't you?" Zhao Xu suddenly changed the subject, trying to regain the initiative.

"Oh, it seems you've reacted too quickly. 'The Sacred Heart Cathedral' is indeed not like anywhere else. I wanted to get close to you without being disturbed, so I had to sacrifice my little followers to distract everyone's attention around you."

Gratzte spoke calmly about his experience of sending his legend-level Sorcerer to his death, his tone completely unemotional.

"A legendary pawn, at our level, is nothing more than that."

"It's only natural that I came here to visit you," Gratzte said. "Last time, you took back the soul of his wife from me, and ultimately lost a legendary Sorcerer-level slave."

"This debt is indeed clear to you," Zhao Xu replied, showing no excitement, his emotions remaining calm and unperturbed, and not attempting to correct the fact that Frank himself was already a nine-ring wizard.

On the contrary, he was very clear.

As long as Rayan wasn't defeated, it was only a matter of time before they found this mysterious space.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had noticed that the steel plate of the alchemy ascension ladder was beginning to distort like waves.

Clearly, it wasn't just the mysterious power that was distorted, but the space itself was becoming fuzzy.

That is, he might not even be in Mistral anymore.

This was something Zhao Xu had judged from the beginning, as he hadn't received Rayan's "Soul Link" response.

The Soul Link was a five-ring skill that allowed for mental communication within a group, and Zhao Xu, with his three rings, could already cast a secondary Soul Link.

The skill itself could cross any distance, whether near or far.
Here is the translation:

"Uniquely, it's impossible to transcend dimensions."
"To make a call that transcends dimensions, you need to use the six-ring 'Larrius Interdimensional Spirit Link'."
"Rae doesn't have the ability to use 'Potential Points' to recover his magical abilities like Anni no Ya, so he has to allocate his magic according to his needs, and he won't use more rings than necessary."
"'You wouldn't think that getting back one's soul from a great abyssal lord is as easy as pie without any aftereffects, would you?' Glatz continued to say with pride."

At this point, he had turned around and was looking directly at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu was aware of what the other person had said, so when he first used the five extraordinary miracles to guarantee that the other person would fulfill their promise, he had used the divine power of Altoria, the divine servant of the fiery heaven, to suppress the other person's divine power.

This was also the reason why he had obtained the million-dollar spirit staff and the crystal of secret silver in a peaceful and rational manner.

"When you complete the task, you also bear the consequences."

"'Can't you just kill me and take revenge here?' Zhao Xu asked back."

Ultimately, the agreement he had with Glatz was only to ensure that the other person would return the soul of Frank, the master of the jade star, to his wife.

As for whether the other person could continue to act or continue to pursue various agreements, there was no detailed agreement.

For demons, breaking an agreement is just a momentary thing, and even Glatz, who was like a "devil" who followed the order, could not change his own "chaotic" camp.

So Zhao Xu had never thought that he was relying on guessing the other person's identity to get back his soul.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This isn't necessary, and as for you players who have come from the projection, you also share some characteristics with us, the Abyssals. After death, you can revive. So, taking your life doesn't have too much significance."

"However, mortal."

Grazzt's tone suddenly became stern.

"Are you satisfied with your current identity as a three-ring mage? Do you feel you've surpassed many other players and are starting to feel complacent?"

"Don't you want to become stronger? Have boundless wealth? And occupy vast territories, becoming the master of Arthur?"

Grazzt's tone carried a hint of insinuation.

Even if players like Zhao Xu had divine protection, they could still be affected by spells that influenced the mind, but Grazzt's "deception", "intimidation", and "negotiation" skills remained unaffected.

The short, plain dialogue seemed to have a mysterious, magical power, slowly seeping into his ears and heart.

In Zhao Xu's mind, a scene he had dreamed of in his past life began to take shape.

He finally understood that the same words, spoken by different people, would have different effects.

"Don't you want to govern your own life? We Abyssals will never leave the Abyss. We only need a proxy for Arthur, a great existence that can manifest our will."

"Do you want to bribe me?" Zhao Xu asked in response.

Although he didn't know why Grazzt's tone was different from usual, as if he was trying to entice him to accept the other's "gift" like a trap.

But why had he become the "bait" again?

Everyone was trying to curry favor and send gifts wherever he went?

"Grazzt, sir, I'm sorry, but I'm the priest of the goddess," Zhao Xu refused firmly.
The trade between mages and demons or devils is not uncommon. In fact, there are unlucky guys like Frank, but that is not the norm. After all, most of the ordinary mages trade with ordinary demons or devils, such as the Balor, Abyssal, and Six-Armed Snake demons, which can be considered the cream of the crop.

Many of these demons and devils have climbed up from the lower levels, having endured centuries of torment, and have collected a considerable number of arcane spell notes and treasures. They often provide tempting trades for mages.

Even someone like Frank, who has reached the level of Grazt, as long as he can muster the courage to give up his wife's soul and allow the other party to become a demon, is not easy to handle before signing an actual contract.

It is not that Grazt's power cannot reach him, but it projected its power to the Arthurian world to conquer a nine-ring mage. The cost incurred is far higher than what he gains or killing a nine-ring mage. This is also why Zhao Xu does not dare to act rashly.

For Grazt to meet him here, the price he has already given exceeds directly seizing the soul of that "Frank" at the time. When Grazt heard the lines of the priestess Zhao Xu, he suddenly couldn't help but burst into laughter.

At this point, an endless black mist emanated from him, revealing a deep and brilliant divine power. "If you give up your priestess identity, I can grant you a legend."
