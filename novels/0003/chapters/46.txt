Chapter 47: Preparing the Stage

After the entire population crossed over, even though the number of people wasn't the largest, the forces they formed still became a crucial power in the later Earth Federation.

"Let's browse some forums casually," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

In an era where players went out to rely on their legs and outdoor areas were especially dangerous, Zhao Xu wouldn't even think about gathering with them before reaching level 3.5.

A magic wand with 50 times the level of the secondary spring technique, priced at 750 GP, would basically become a must-have strategic material for the guild in the future.

Zhao Xu didn't explain much and continued to brush his phone.

Therefore, Zhao Xu needed a proxy representative to manage some of the guild's powers, making it easier for him to prepare the stage and intervene in the Earth Federation in the future.

In the past, he had heard Zhang Qi complain about the mess numerous times during the school's large-scale event. He was afraid that he would appear at the ceremony and something miraculous would happen, causing a sensation.

"Xu Ge, do you know that the South's Shi Nai has been crazy lately?" Zhang Qi said, sitting in the chair he had modified, drinking ice cola while speaking.

Later, he became a non-combat expert and took on the profession of a teacher, but unfortunately, he died in the Seventh Year's Seal War and was defeated.

The Saint Warrior in the past was a straightforward and honest guardian, facing evil behavior with a strong punch and no mercy.

The secondary spring technique has been mentioned on the forum, and it's a level 1 divine technique that is not included in the standard list of level 1 priest techniques. It can only be obtained through special channels.
Here is the translation of the text:

The only effect is to allow players to obtain the "Quick Healing 1" ability, which is equivalent to recovering 1 HP per round, and can last for tens of rounds.

Unlike starting a half-dead and half-alive business like Zhao Xu's, looking up at the sky for a stable income is too many.

After Liu Hanqiang started university, he directly planned to take the research student exam at his alma mater and pursue a career as a civil servant.

The average quality of university students is high, and they have ample time, and their level in Arthur's world is mostly upper-middle-class.

After simple experimentation with the remaining spells, Zhao Xu directly logged off.

"Ah, Xu Shen, your reaction is too fast," Zhang Qi said with a hint of amazement.

"Is it the Revival Spell? Wand?" Zhang Qi asked curiously.

It's already hard to make players truly believe in the gods, and it's even harder to get the gods' recognition.

"Wait for me to have money," Zhao Xu continued to chat, still sitting on the bed, but constantly scrolling through the Arthur forum.

Zhao Xu nodded, and after half a month, the number of people who had officially graduated from the Ministry of Magic was not much better than that of the Wizards.

"What's taking you so long to get back, Xu Shen?" Zhang Qi complained.

"Don't rush, wait until later when everyone has money to buy the Revival Spell and Wand, and this situation will be much better," Zhao Xu said.

In the thoughts of the three people in their dormitory, Liu Hanqiang, who had a background and was willing to work hard, was definitely the one who would take the most stable path in the future.

He didn't want to become the main character of the forum.

Even if he didn't know anyone around him, the people in the church were too busy arranging today's grand ceremony to have time for him.

Moreover, some departmental positions his family had already helped him prepare, with everything ready.

"Oh no, big brother, I've been struggling to get online every day and it's already so tiring."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu became a mage and was able to arrange his parents and relatives very well. Liu Hanqiang came from a good family and his whole family was made up of state-owned enterprise officials. "What about the Great Alliance?" Zhao Xu asked.

At the same time, another roommate, Chen Sennan, who had been wearing a pair of glasses, was considered the most compatible with Zhao Xu in the dormitory. The Saint Warrior at level 2 can obtain the ability to heal, which can heal HP equal to the charisma adjustment value multiplied by the profession level.

Although it cannot restore full HP at once, the healing amount exceeds the amount of Zhao Xu's "Light Wound Treatment" spell, making it a mainstream recovery method after the battle. The common people of Arthur's land will all hold up their thumbs to praise the Saint Warrior.

"Xu, how fast are you today?" Zhang Qi asked, who had just returned from class in the afternoon and saw Zhao Xu busy waving at him.

"What's going on in the class guild?" Zhao Xu asked.

Chen Sennan, who was usually not very talkative, was considered a "mushroom" by Zhao Xu, who usually asked Zhang Qi about the guild.

"Is Saint Healing not a level 2 ability of the Saint Warrior?" Zhao Xu asked, who was very sensitive about this aspect.

However, no one expected that a seemingly idle game would become the master of the fate of countless people.

In his previous life, Liu Hanqiang looked at the target he had been working towards for ten years disappear after the crisis, and he became depressed for a long time.

The Saint Warrior in Arthur's land is actually a very mysterious profession. Their team requires extremely strict requirements.

However, as long as one has a strong sense of faith and character, they can quickly complete the promotion of the Saint Warrior.

In his previous life, Zhao Xu was pulled into Arthur's land by Zhang Qi, but Liu Hanqiang insisted on his own will.

However, humans are social beings, and arranging them to ascend to the floating heavenly city is meaningless.
Here is the translation of the text:

Druids who can serve as substitutes in healing can be found squatting in the forest, fighting against those who destroy the forest, and undergoing the same grueling training.

Zhang Qi's eyes widened in surprise as he asked, "Brother, how do you know this? I'm the backbone of the team, and you're more clear-headed than me."

But Chen Siren just pushed Zhang Qi aside, telling him to stop talking nonsense.

In their previous life, Zhao Xiu had already succeeded in his advancement and became a powerful force in the temple of the just god.

While believing in the divine, they became even more strict with their own beliefs.

"Ah, it's already been a few battles since the revival stone was used up, and we're starting to register new characters. The spell-casting professions are almost all unselected, and those who can't see the effect of their spells are almost no one chooses," Zhang Qi complained about the current miserable state of Arther.

Zhao Xiu's current top priority is to be honest and make a fortune, at least he has a solid route now.

In such a lack of healing circumstances, warriors with some healing abilities have become the target of "seeking medical attention in a hurry".

This is also the only profession that Arthur cannot refuse to play.

"Xiu god, Siren is now the most popular team in our class, everyone is waiting for him to reach level 2 to lead the team," Zhang Qi added as he noticed the other two in the dorm room had also returned and greeted him.

Zhang Qi and his friends had known that Zhao Xiu was born in the southern town of Arthur, and they were far from the winter town players like them.

But now, they are all poor, with only a few gold coins on their bodies, and they can't even buy anything.

Liu Hanqiang, a scholar from the province of Lu, is the top student in their dormitory, and he is the only one who has never played games in his previous life.
Here is the translation of the text:

The pastor who chooses to take sides needs to get the recognition of the entire team, and even Arthur is rare in this regard.

Although it's not enough, but for the current players, it's better to expect the Holy Warrior to reach level 2 than to wait for the pastors to be trained.

Even ordinary players who form a team to level up will buy a sword collectively, and the number of player pastors is very few in their school.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, "Qi Shen, how's it been lately?"
