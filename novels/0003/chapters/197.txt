Chapter 198: Post-War Harvest

The so-called "good" descriptor means that evil clergymen cannot cast this spell. Just like Zhao Xu, a good cleric, cannot cast the "Omni-Seeing" spell with an evil descriptor.

"God's Hammer" is a "sacred magic" above the good descriptor.

This type of spell can be used by both mages and clerics, but casting it will come with a price! It's not just a material cost, but a sacrifice made for the sake of good.

"God's Hammer" is a damage-dealing spell that Zhao Xu has been paying close attention to in the final scroll space. Another spell he has been paying close attention to is "Infernal Blaze".

Casting "God's Hammer" requires sacrificing one's own life force, resulting in 1-3 points of damage.

The solution is, naturally, to cast a recovery spell immediately to compensate.

It's just like releasing a spell that drains life force and then using a healing spell to recover.

Even without relying on the "Omni-Book", Zhao Xu has mastered the "Secondary Recovery Technique" of the Ring of Saint Warrior, which can restore attribute damage.

At this moment, Zhao Xu is also preparing to cast the spell to rescue himself, as his original strength is only 8 points.

Generally, the cost of magic items is borne by the manufacturer, but the cost of sacred magic is borne by the user.

After all, fighting for the sake of good is a noble cause, and the cost is indeed someone else's words. However, this is not a very good thing.

However, after casting the spell, Zhao Xu discovered that he had not suffered any damage.

"Master, praise me,"

Larx's voice suddenly cut in at this time.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Zhao Xu heard these words, he immediately understood that the item in his hand was a divine artifact, which couldn't be judged by ordinary logic.

At the same time, his attention was focused on the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" that had just been subjected to his two "Justice Hammer" spells.

The "Justice Hammer" is a force-based spell that shares the same nature as the "Magic Missile", or can be considered an enhanced version of it.

Compared to the 2-5 HP damage of "Magic Missile", the damage of "Justice Hammer" is 1D6 (1-6) damage per spellcaster level, while facing evil enemies, it increases to 1D8 (1-8) damage.

The "Tome of All Laws" has a 20-level spellcaster level, so the natural damage curve will increase to 20D8 (20-160) points of damage.

From the perspective of the spell's structure, this is equivalent to stacking 20 layers of 1-8 point damage, so the final damage curve will present a normal distribution, with a maximum probability of around 90 points of damage, rather than a uniform distribution of 20-160 points of damage.

Low-level mages love using "Magic Missile" because the force field is difficult to resist, and it doesn't require aiming like a shot, so there's no situation where the spell fails to hit.

The "Deep Prison Refining Demon" itself is immune to fire and poison damage, and has 10 points of resistance to acid and cold damage, and can only withstand two blows from Zhao Xu's "Justice Hammer" spells.

As the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" was startled by the two "Justice Hammer" spells, it finally showed a look of anger or terror.

The force energy still stirred up inside its body, destroying half of its life force.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This 'Deep Furnace Refiner' has lost the divine assistance of the underworld and has only 225 HP, which is the standard value in the material plane. Despite this, it is still troubled and unable to understand why low-level spells can be so powerful. For example, its own three-ring spell, Fireball, deals 1D6 (1-6) damage per caster level, with a maximum damage of 10-60 points. Even with nearly 18th-level spellcasting ability, it is unable to cause significant damage. This is the "Injustice of the Hammer" - the higher the caster level, the higher the damage, with no limit. At this point, the 'Deep Furnace Refiner' has awakened to its previous "Law and Order" being ineffective. It immediately began to use the ancient language of the furnace to call out the names of other demons. At this point, Zhao Xu was still in the stage of casting a spell and had only a few seconds to continue casting. However, he saw that the demon did not continue to use the "Group Monster Binding Spell" or even try to dispel the protective methods on its body. Zhao Xu knew that the other party had awakened and was calling for help. The "Summon Demon" ability is a super-natural ability of the demon tribe, allowing it to summon demons of higher levels as its own level increases. At this moment, a series of six crimson and eerie portal rings appeared above the altar platform. "Who summoned me? Oh, it's the material plane?"
Here is the translation:

As a faint and joyful phrase echoed, a massive "Deep Furnace Demon" with a body entirely covered in crimson scales and wings emerged from the portal, its flames still crackling. The remaining portal energy circles began to vibrate violently, as if ready to replay.

Suddenly, the portal vibrated at an excessively high frequency, like it was about to overload, and a thick smoke burst out, momentarily obscuring the scene ahead.

However, Zhao Xu's gaze still managed to see through the smoke, and he saw the "Deep Furnace Demons" continuing to emerge from the portal.

When the smoke dissipated, the originally empty altar square was now occupied by seven "Deep Furnace Demons" that stood at four meters tall, making them appear somewhat short.

The demons, however, did not take action immediately. Instead, they began to summon others, just like the first "Deep Furnace Demon" had done.

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed slightly, but he did not turn the page of the "Treatise on the Laws of the Universe". Instead, he continued to use the third-time fusion spell!

The two "Judgment Hammer" spells that had appeared earlier were activated simultaneously by Zhao Xu. However, the target of the spells was not any of the "Deep Furnace Demons" present, nor was it the first one.

Instead, the spells flew towards the corner of the square, and suddenly, a low, mournful cry echoed through the empty space.

A "Deep Furnace Demon" suddenly appeared on the ground, its life force already zeroed out, indicating that it had died as an otherworldly being.

Slowly, its body began to bubble with foam, and its scales began to dissolve, its once-hard body gradually decomposing into mush.
After losing control, the altar hall in the grand plaza suddenly became quiet. The seven "Deep Furnace Demons" that were originally there had turned to dust and disappeared.

The molten lava and sulfur on the ground, which was suffocatingly pungent, suddenly dissipated.

"Wow, this demon is really pathetic. Instead of summoning a demon, it's using illusions," Lark said, looking at Zhao Xuan, who was now safe.

Zhao Xuan slowly walked to the pile of decaying, rotten flesh that was once the "Deep Furnace Demons", having witnessed the death scenes of demons in his past life. He was not surprised by this scene.

He kept a safe distance to avoid feeling nauseous.

"This 'Deep Furnace Demon' is really incompetent. If it had the ability to directly summon six demons of the same level, it could have unleashed an infinite chain reaction and defeated Arthur," Zhao Xuan said.

Lark coughed and said, "Master, you've clearly used the 'True Knowledge' spell to see through the fact that the seven 'Deep Furnace Demons' were illusions."

Zhao Xuan had regained some of his composure from his past life and didn't feel embarrassed.

In fact, he knew that he didn't have the 'True Knowledge' spell.

The "Deep Furnace Demons" could only summon demons twice a day, summoning demons of level 10-15, and only one at a time.

It was impossible for them to perform such a feat, directly summoning six demons, creating a smoke screen, and then hiding and using a teleportation spell to escape.

It's not like they didn't read the books of magic.

Zhao Xuan directly unleashed the "Justice Hammer" at the invisible "Deep Furnace Demon" that was hiding in the corner, ready to use a teleportation spell to escape.
Here's the translation:

"Chief, you intentionally released the 'Noble' spell, right?" Zhao Xu asked.

"To erase the trace, you know. After being struck by the noble energy, the corpse of the 'Deep Furnace' will disintegrate faster. If not, the residual fragments will linger for several years, and your previous release of those spells may be exposed," Lark said, reminding him.

"Besides, don't you want to search for treasures in that filthy mess?" Zhao Xu replied.

At this point, Zhao Xu nodded to indicate he understood.

This also meant that Ray and his party were getting close, and Zhao Xu had indeed been gone for a while.

"No, 'Justice Hammer' is a three-ring spell, and 'The Book of the Universe' should at least record four-ring spells," Zhao Xu pointed out immediately after the battle, when he suddenly noticed this point.

"Ah, ah, chief, I'm a divine artifact within a divine artifact, and it's difficult to transcend the original divine artifact. But I can still downgrade a bit," Lark explained.

"Ah, Lark," Zhao Xu said suddenly, with a smile.

He had already realized that the remaining time for "The Book of the Universe" was running out.

"Ah? Chief, do you have any orders?" Lark asked.

"Prayer spell," Zhao Xu issued a new spell page instruction.
