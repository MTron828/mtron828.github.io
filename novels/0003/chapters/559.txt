Chapter 560: The Millionaire Mount, Treasure Trove Whence

No matter who, no one could have thought that they would hear the name "Zhōng Xià" for the third time in just a day.

The followers of the Magic Goddess among the players immediately sensed that this was the will of the goddess. Those who had already believed in the goddess knelt down with utmost devotion to listen to this teaching.

As for the players who had realized their true identities after crossing over, they were astonished and envious to hear such a high-level blessing. This was truly a "crown" bestowed by the gods.

Even if they were to surpass Zhōng Xià in the future, it would be meaningless. The most crucial "first place" had already been obtained by him.

The ordinary players, on the other hand, couldn't help but smile bitterly as they thought about the one-month hiatus. The name "Zhōng Xià" had fallen from the pedestal, and now entered a new world, only to find that it had reached a higher level, directly entering the realm of the gods, and receiving protection and recognition.

Recalling the words spoken by Zhōng Xià, which seemed to imply that this land was a "promised land" bestowed upon him. Not the countless refugees who had lost their homeland and wandered to this new world.

This news stirred up a huge wave, although it wasn't explicitly discussed, it deeply buried itself in the hearts of the people, and also made countless ordinary people remember the name "Yǎn Nǎn".
Here is the translation of the text:

In the minds of the intelligent and resourceful individuals among humanity, there are many who are aware of the boundaries of the desolate dead land, which have been sealed off, allowing neither entry nor exit. The representatives of the major powers have not been slow to respond, having shifted the key regions of the fallen star town. However, with the promise and allure of "other forces," "Yan Nan" has deeply penetrated the hearts of many, able to provide food and do things that even the gods cannot. Who has the strongest backing is easy to imagine.

The "Sacred Residence" spell, which has a five-ring effect, was originally designed for deployment in key areas, such as churches, temples, and royal palaces.

To deploy this spell, it requires 24 hours of concentration and will take effect immediately, with a range of only 12 meters. Additionally, it can be combined with basic divine magic, such as eliminating invisibility, detecting magic, and detecting evil. These effects can last for a year, making it an excellent area protection spell.

However, saying a thousand times over, "cannot be transformed into an undead being" is the most direct and pressing concern for humans. After death, one must be urgently cremated, otherwise, they will become zombies, causing immense suffering in the hearts of the living. Many people are crying and struggling to see their elderly relatives, who are already struggling to survive. Not to mention the funeral, not even a single day's worth of mourning can be waited for, and one must immediately burn the body where it lies.

At the moment, the desolate dead land is barely able to find a few withered branches and rotten leaves to burn. This is because, within a day, many people with weak physical constitutions have been affected by the waves of energy emanating from this place, and many have been transformed into zombies.
As information dissemination spreads, the public comes to realize that the so-called "zombies" are not contagious and do not pose a threat of infection. The entire process of elimination is extremely rapid.

At this time, the profession of "pastor" has become one of the most sought-after careers in Ares.

Even ordinary and inconspicuous people in their daily lives have become a beacon of hope for the people in each block.

"Let's go! Head to Ares!"
"That's right, that's where the living are."
"Don't distribute food yet, hurry and prepare to depart."
As Zhao Xu receives the divine blessing from the heavens, a column of light radiating with supernatural power breaks through the clouds and directly hits the roof of the high tower of the Mage Association.

It becomes the most eye-catching "beacon" guiding the entire desolate land.

Anyone can see this column of light by simply looking up at the sky, and by judging the sense of distance in space, they can estimate the distance between the two places.

After obtaining the title of "Ares," Zhao Xu did not stop, immediately opening the storage room that had been prepared in advance, and transporting emergency food to the surrounding areas.

At the same time, he arranged the people he had recruited to cultivate the land that had been converted for a long time within a radius of a hundred miles.

Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei are clear that they cannot rely solely on their own strength to supply everyone and also cannot accommodate everyone at once.

They can initially cope with the population of tens of millions to hundreds of millions in the surrounding area, which is already an extremely outstanding achievement. The transportation force alone is the true key to Ares.

Meanwhile, other blocks also have various powerful forces intervening, providing help and recruiting outstanding personnel.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is also something that cannot be stopped by Zhao Xu at the moment. He can only continue to hold up this banner, letting these interstellar travelers know that there is a place to return to, and he can slowly absorb power in this way.

"Behind me, I have spent hours using the 'Warfare Technique: Food Creation' to produce a large quantity of temporary food. You can use these emergency rations, although the taste is general, but it's enough to get by."

As people continued to travel through the wormhole, "food", "water", and "sleep" became the three essential elements that were taken seriously.

Zhao Xu instructed Wang Qingwei, "First, open up the food supply, and wait until everything is stable before people start to understand how to dig up food from the ground themselves."

"After each region has experienced a few hours of chaos, it has now stabilized and order has been restored. Therefore, we need to make contact with them first."

Zhao Xu said this, also hoping for the best.

He had analyzed two shipwreck incidents in the past, where the number of people on board was similar, and the composition of the passengers was the same. However, the outcome was vastly different. One ship had a majority of young people, while the other had a majority of the elderly and those with disabilities.

It wasn't until the difference was discovered that it was realized that the time difference was the key factor.

If it was a catastrophic disaster, the instinct to survive would make the young people survive. However, if there was enough time, giving people enough time to think would leave the opportunity for survival to the weak and vulnerable.

Zhao Xu didn't think he could save everyone, so he believed that each region could rely on its own resources and the support of the many gods and various transmission resources to get through the initial period.

However, it's not like adding flowers to a jade pendant; it's more like sending coal in the snow.

Unless he was certain that he was in a territory with a population of tens of millions, he would have to prioritize establishing connections in the initial period."
Here is the translation of the text:

At the time, there were guards stationed around the storage room located behind the association's base, where an endless sea of food and water was piled up. One of the stacks, created by Zhao Xu with a two-hour spellcasting time, contained 1.8 million rations.

Zhao Xu then flew to the plain behind.

As the divine blessing descended, the original crossers' eyes looked at Zhao Xu with reverence, as if they were in the presence of a saint. In an instant, many people's inner hearts realized that they had crossed over again, and the crossers had unknowingly re-divided themselves.

Everyone's eyes were fixed on Zhao Xu, eagerly anticipating his next move.

Slowly, under the blessing of the divine pillar of light, the civilians from the nearby mountains and plains arrived, but Zhao Xu's aura of no wind or breeze, combined with the explanations of others, made people dare not approach him.

At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

He had prepared the food for half a year, although there were some setbacks, but he had still managed to recover a significant amount.

Now, he needed to radiate these food supplies and send them out.

As a 8th-level divine spellcaster, Zhao Xu had long since risen to 33rd level after completing a set of decaying domain spells.

At this moment, he directly pulled out a bundle of prayer beads from the dimensional bag, with 144 beads tightly packed inside.

Each bead was a magical bead that could once a day, for 10 minutes, increase the level of a divine spellcaster by 4 levels, covering a 24-hour period without interruption. With 33 levels, the beads activated, reaching 37 levels.

"The War Spell: Royal Cavalry", a four-ring spell, took 1 minute to cast, summoning 25 light horses per level, lasting 2 hours per level, with a casting cost of 1500 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Royal Cavalry is an upgraded version of the Summoning Mount spell, which this time summons a heavy-duty horse that can carry a large amount of cargo, in addition to being equipped with a bridle, reins, saddle, saddle pad, decorative elements, and a banner. On the banner is the latest emblem of Yan Nan.

Using the "Position of the Spells" with the "Mysterious Premonition" property, the spellcasting time is compressed to one round.

At level 37, a total of 925 light horses were summoned.

After using the "Three-Ring Spell" to delay the spellcasting, it took 148 hours and 6 days for level 37.

The supernatural spell cancelled out the 1,500 gold coin spellcasting fee.

The "First-Round Potential Point Recovery" and "Second-Round Supernatural Ability Recovery" spells were used.

After the entire process, Zhao Xu averaged 12 seconds per round to create 925 horses that could last for 6 days.

As a result, all the passersby, including Zhao Xu's parents and relatives, were amazed to see the flat land in front of them, with 925 horses suddenly appearing, overwhelming in number.

However, the horses that appeared were not wild horses, but rather decorated horses that could be used as an honor guard.

Esveia, who had previously been confident in her progress, was taken aback by Zhao Xu's antics and couldn't help but lose her composure.

Because she realized that the core spell of these horses was the one-ring "Summon Mount" spell, but it was only one horse, and far from the thousands of horses in front of her.

"The key is, can it last long?" Esveia was troubled, "Don't tell me it's just an illusion!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't worry, Xiao Xi." Wang Congwei smiled and hugged Aisvi.
"Our future begins from here."
No one could have imagined that Zhao Xu would spend so much effort to achieve this. He used "Premonition of the Future", "War Magic", "Potential Points", "Spell Delay", "Supernatural Magic", and other key methods, except for delaying time, which would cause chaos if released. The key to success lay in his leveling up as a mage, relying on a series of spells and magical items such as "Domain of Decline", "Physical Sacrifice", "Arson Cross", "Magic Crystal", "Ritual", "Magical Tattoo", "Holy Scripture", "Strength of Magic", and "Enchanting Melody", which ultimately led to his peak 37th-level mage level.

After cultivating for half a year in this dual-elite account, Zhao Xu finally achieved his breakthrough at this moment of transcendence.

As the horses in front of him appeared, the onlookers' initial shock gradually turned to numbness, and some even knelt down in awe, stunned by this miracle.

In one hour, 280,000 horses were generated. In ten hours, 2.8 million horses were generated.

These horses, loaded with food and water, began to set off from the center of the continent, spreading out in all directions.

Gradually, the entire continent began to spread the legend of creating a million heavy horses on the summer solstice, as if bestowing divine blessings.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu began to use teleportation magic, constantly moving to each region to coordinate and create food and horses, providing transportation for these regions to alleviate the initial crisis.

He was like an unstoppable train, racing towards the horizon.
Until then, he gently completed the transmission and descended in front of the astonished crowd, suddenly hearing a voice that had been absent for a long time at his ear - "Journey, you didn't come to find me even though you crossed the summer solstice? Has the treasure house been abandoned?"
