Chapter 563: The Legendary Cleric's Junior

The Holy One descended from heaven, which is a beautiful phrase coined by Annethinoja.

However, Zhao Xu could already sense the presence of "bloody stench" from it.

To put it bluntly, the Holy One's descent from heaven means "Holy Catastrophe".

This implies that the gods have lost their divine power and descended to the mortal realm, having a profound impact on the cleric profession.

Some weak clerics directly became former clerics, losing all their power.

It's like the historical legend Zhao Xu once read about a world where, after the loss of the Magic Goddess, all mages lost their magic, and the floating cities fell to the ground, resulting in countless casualties.

Zhao Xu could only be grateful that his cleric level was only 1.

If this were to happen, the impact would be even more exaggerated.

Clerics may be fake, but their followers will be real.

Therefore, the gods may unleash even stronger powers to accumulate strength, striving for a larger foundation to gain the opportunity for reincarnation.

The Holy Catastrophe is terrifying, as the gods walk on earth, transforming into ants-like powers.

Like the ancient history recorded on Earth, when Qin lost its deer, the world followed to chase after it.

When the gods descend, they will be like a pig roaming the earth, leaving a trail of bloody rain wherever they go. Even those who have been hiding for years will suddenly take action to seize divine power.

After Annethinoja and Zhao Xu emerged from the ancient temple in the bottom of the Star Lake, they told him about the Holy One's descent from heaven.
When she specifically mentioned it, she pointed out that 99% of humans on Earth may not encounter this event before they die, so Zhao Xu didn't worry too much about it.

However, in the July without God, it seemed that a massive upheaval had indeed occurred, so severe that it was like a holy war of the gods, and it had come early.

As Zhao Xu thought about the entire northern region having to endure another wave of demon-quelling battles, he suddenly felt that this mortal world was indeed unbearable.

After parting with Anzhi Noya, Zhao Xu hid his whereabouts and transmitted himself to the Holy Warrior Corps of the Just God.

At the same time, a crystal that replaced the "mirror" on his forehead was still floating. This crystal, given to him by Anzhi Noya, was worth a total of 120,000 gold coins in terms of production costs, and it was an extremely rare item that even Arthur's wealth could not buy.

Every time this crystal appeared on the market, even before it reached the auction house, it was already snatched away by someone at a high price.

This crystal, known as the "Hidden Eye", had the largest effect of being able to detect, influence, or read the emotions or thoughts of magical items, spells, or spiritual powers, including any spells with the description of "influencing the heart" or "searching", and it could protect the owner.

Even if one tried to achieve this through limited wish spells, divine miracles, reality reversals, or wish spells, it would be of no use. However, Zhao Xu, who possessed the crystal, was like a non-existent being, even when the region he was in was searched by secret law, exploration, and other spells.

This was the "Hidden Eye", and wearing it would be like having the 8-ring spell "Mind Shield" for 24 hours.
Here is the translation of the text:

According to what Anzha said, this is a magical artifact created by the goddess Sylvia, who is said to possess magical powers. Even if the magical powers intervene, it can protect the secret innermost thoughts. However, since Zhao Xu's thoughts are now easily accessible, even a slight thought can trigger a strong earthquake in Arthur.

This is also the reason why Anzha needs to seamlessly connect the timeline during this period to find this magical equipment for him. Even if it conflicts with Zhao Xu's previous magical glasses, he will have to remove the hidden eye and leave a gap in his mind. Therefore, the magical glasses, which had saved Zhao Xu countless gold coins, can now exit the stage after he has acquired the potential points and supernatural powers.

On top of Zhao Xu's head, there are several Ayn stones floating, including the orange-colored prism Ayn stone, which increases the mage's level by one. The transparent Ayn stone does not require water and food to sustain life. The seven-colored Ayn stone does not require air to survive. The pearl-white Ayn stone automatically recovers 1 point of damage per hour.

With these Ayn stones, Zhao Xu can be considered a survival master in the wilderness. Moreover, the magical equipment on his head is comparable to a small, unstable star system in rotation, but without the green hat-shaped magic. The "Hidden Eye" is a magical item that all kingdoms in Arthur's kingdom must have. Otherwise, any wizard who specializes in controlling systems can easily overthrow the entire country.

For example, Zhao Xu is now using the "Control Humans" spell, making even strong warriors difficult to resist.
Here is the translation of the text:

What's more crucial is that this concealed eye was also utilized by Xisilvana to unleash a temporary special ability.

It can see through a "commoner's" magical aptitude.

In fact, he doesn't even need to approach her personally to see the "light pillar" connecting to the magic domain above each person's head from a distant location.

Just before Anniya disappeared, Zhao Xu took a snapshot of her.

Instantly, his field of vision turned white, like snow blindness, and he couldn't see a single detail for a while, almost like a visual attack.

After returning to Ya Nan, Zhao Xu met the mage team sent by Mistral.

This team even included Reid, a mage who had boasted about breaking through the legendary barrier and had almost reached the ceremony of legend.

However, Reid had not yet officially become a legend.

Without a doubt, Mistral sent a team of over a hundred mages to Ya Nan.

In addition to bringing a large number of resources, these mages also brought Zhao Xu's team to nearby areas to provide emergency humanitarian aid in the name of Ya Nan.

Compared to the teams of gods and saints, this was impressive.

At this time, Zhao Xu continued to use the special ability of his concealed eye to scan the aptitude light pillar in front of Reid, only to find that it was actually not much different from that of some outstanding six-ring mages in the team.

"Strange." Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a closer look at Reid, even putting aside the urgent need to find excellent and reliable mage seeds.

"What's wrong? Did I become more dashing because I'm getting close to being a legend?"
Here is the translation:

Lai An couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, intentionally curling his eyebrows, and said with a smile, "However, I must declare that I have no interest in men."

As he spoke, his gaze couldn't help but glance at the women who had been summoned to take on administrative work on the scene.

After crossing into the Arthurian era, these outstanding women had experienced half a day and a night of witnessing the dangers of the world, understanding that unless there was a major change, Arthur would be their future.

Having seen their friends and family turn against each other for a small amount of resources, they cherished this precious opportunity to enter the core area of Jianan.

As he spoke, they were exaggerating, but they were indeed worthy of being the first batch of pioneers in Jianan.

These women, who had excellent school and work experiences and emotional intelligence, didn't need to be reminded by their families or friends, and knew they had to grasp this rare opportunity.

With a large group of magicians accompanying Lai An, they knew that he was definitely a big shot, and didn't have the thought of passing small notes.

However, it was suddenly Zhao Xu who appeared, and after exchanging a few words with Lai An, he became the new focus of attention for the women.

Even a few of the more beautiful women, after a round of "struggle", got the opportunity to receive documents, but none of them caught the attention of the two men.

However, Zhao Xu used his light column judgment and saw a beautiful woman with a low profile, who was writing documents, and decided to wait and observe for a while, wondering if she could be included in the seed sequence.

Just then, Zhao Xu snapped back to reality, heard Lai An's question, and smiled, saying, "I think your talent is a bit ordinary, strange, and almost doubted myself."
Here is the translation of the text:

Rein, who had been smiling and carefree, suddenly looked at Zhao Xu with a serious expression, as if he had just regained his senses, and said, "How could you think my talent is average?"

"Yes, I'm also confused," Zhao Xu replied. "You said you could break through the limits quickly, but the Archbishop of the Holy See was stuck in the pastor's ability, so I thought you had a lot of talent, which is why I'm puzzled."

Rein had entered the core sequence in the past half-year since he entered the game, and had gained the basic trust of Anzelina, the guardian of the hidden eye. This time, he had also revealed the temporary effects of the hidden eye to Zhao Xu, who knew more about the content and the people working with him.

However, without expecting it, there was no rebuttal.

Rein lowered his eyebrows and said, "Ah, it seems I'm really stupid."

"In the past, I was a prodigy at the small magic academy, so I was recommended to continue my studies at the floating city. But after that, I realized that even a noble young master who had been stuck at the apprentice level for five or six years had talent that was no weaker than mine."

"So from then on, I worked extremely hard, using all my free time to study magic, and eventually achieved the breakthrough to today's nine rings."

As Rein finished speaking, he looked up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, revealing a hint of nostalgia.

A girl who had just brought over a new pot of hot tea stood there, staring at the scene in a daze.

"Rein, big brother, you're talking nonsense without knowing the background," Zhao Xu said helplessly, flipping through the files of the wizarding team in his hand, which detailed the situation of the wizards sent to Yann, including Rein's.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In your file, it is recorded that you broke through the fifth circle by taking advantage of the situation and pleasing the seven leaders of the association, including Master Caspius, and as a reward, you were given permission to read a mysterious magical notebook.

Breaking through the sixth circle is because you got injured during your mission and then decided to dedicate your life to the Rose Cross, and the association gave you a reward. Breaking through the seventh circle is because your tutor, Anniya, purchased a treasure from you and gave you compensation.

As for breaking through the eighth circle..."

"Enough!" Li An waved his hand hastily, "I don't know how it was recorded so clearly."

In general, Li An's every step of breaking through was a wild ride of good luck, and his strength directly rebounded to his position in the Rose Cross, making him the one who held the upper hand.

So Li An wanted to show off in front of Zhao Xu, but that was definitely not possible.

"Hey, let me take a look at this thing," Li An suddenly became curious.

Zhao Xu hesitated for a moment before handing it over.

With a legendary nine-circle mage like Li An, his question wasn't a big deal.

As Li An looked at the crystal, he was very excited and quickly said, "Let me take a look at their ordinary level and I'll hand it over to you right away."

At this moment, Li An quickly put on the crystal and glanced at the distant new mage, trying to judge according to this.

After getting the answer, he turned around and looked at Zhao Xu.

However, before he could say anything, he suddenly took off the crystal and handed it to Zhao Xu.

"You can perform well enough, but I'm not the right audience," Zhao Xu said, already judging Li An's acting as over-the-top.

"No, you'll never see what I've seen."

At this moment, Li An was still nervous.

Zhao Xu couldn't see his innate talent pillar, which made him even more curious."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I saw that on your body, there are four books spread out, and a colossal light beam shoots straight up to the sky."

"Moreover, everyone else's is straight up, but yours is spiraling upwards. You said you would become a goddess and walk the path of the legendary magicians, and I believe you."

At this moment, Zhao Xu slightly lowered his head.

He happened to have four notebooks on his body, which he called "Summer's Magical Notes".

This means that these things are helping him develop his innate talent?

Because they have helped him level up before, but he just didn't see those things that helped him level up on the light beam of Rai'an.

As he hesitated, Rai'an couldn't help but shake his head, "It seems I also have to bow down to you on this side and ask for your help, and who knows if I can rely on you to level up."

Zhao Xu almost laughed out loud when he heard this, "You're taking a wrong remedy in a critical situation."

"That's it, I have to go and get some work done," he said, standing up and preparing to fulfill Anthea's task.

Suddenly, he hesitated and turned around to look at Rai'an, "Why can't you break through to become a legendary?"

"I'd know if I knew, I'd already be a legendary magician," Rai'an said with a bad mood.

"If I could make you become a legendary magician," Zhao Xu said with a whimsical tone.

"That I would definitely serve you, the lord of the land, with my life," Rai'an said, using a colloquialism he had just learned from the girls.

"You said that," Zhao Xu suddenly smiled without good intentions.

He happened to know of a place where he could level up without using his notebooks.

Summer Team, Legendary Stronger +1.
