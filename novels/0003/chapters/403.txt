Chapter 404: Bead Necklace

"It's because they're too valuable, so it's only possible to summon them if you're interested," said the vendor.

Zhou Xu didn't express any opinion and asked instead.

Magic items can be roughly categorized into several types: weapons and armor, rings, potions and elixirs, wands, staffs, scrolls, and miscellaneous items.

This categorization is based on the expertise in manufacturing magic items. To manufacture a ring, for example, one needs to have the expertise in "ring crafting".

As a result, most people choose to specialize in "manufacturing miscellaneous items", which covers a wide range of equipment and can directly cover the manufacturing of about 90% of the items.

He also noticed the layout in front of him, which consisted mainly of miscellaneous items, categorized into "level 1", "level 2", and "level 3" based on their prices.

Arthur's classification of miscellaneous items is based on their prices, with items priced above 7,500 gold coins being considered level 2 and those above 28,000 gold coins being considered level 3.

The room brought by Sara Zhi was not like other ordinary black market stalls, with most of the items being level 2 and level 3 miscellaneous items.

If someone were to loot this place, they would likely become instantly wealthy.

Even Zhou Xu, a good-natured person, felt a strong temptation, let alone others.

"Can I cast a spell?" Zhou Xu asked.

Sara Zhi took a deep breath and asked calmly, "What kind of spell?"

"Divination of secrets," Zhou Xu replied.

"It's possible," Sara Zhi thought for a moment before agreeing.

This is ultimately about buying things, not relying on luck.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoxu directly assumes a spellcasting pose, accompanied by a incantation, and in an instant, his eyes burst forth with a blue light. Within a 40-meter range, all magical items will reveal their magical auras before him. Compared to the "Detection Magic" of the zero-ring, "Secret Vision" does not require Zhaoxu to focus intentionally and will not take a long time to judge the type, quantity, and intensity of the magic. All magical items in his field of vision will clearly reflect their intensity and position in his eyes. He can even perform a simple "Spell Identification" to determine the specific magical affiliation. This illusion is too evil, deceiving many people, making everyone cautious when buying magical items. If Zhaoxu focuses on a specific person, he can also see if they are a divine or occult practitioner and their specific ring number. He glanced at a rosary on the table, "It's a divine item, isn't it?" Sara Ji cleared her throat, thinking she shouldn't speak to customers. However, she couldn't help but speak out loud. "Yes?" "Okay." Sara quickly recalled the rule not to ask customers questions and hastily pushed her cart away, then climbed up the stairs to open the cabinet door and take down the rosary, placing it on the cart in front of Zhaoxu. At this moment, Zhaoxu took out a yellow bronze magnifying glass and carefully examined the rosary in front of him. Meanwhile, above the high platform, something was being observed that they could not see.

"What's the point of that?" an older man exclaimed in surprise.

"Or is it some unknown magical item?"

At this moment, he was also holding a string of beads similar to those held by Zhao Xu in his hand. The man wore a simple white robe, with the emblem of the Commercial Goddess embroidered on the hem.

The elderly wizard beside him looked down, thinking for a long time before speaking with a hint of doubt, "Shouldn't it?"

"What shouldn't it?" the middle-aged man immediately sensed something was off.

As the night's duty officer of the black market, he had extremely high authority and even had the power to set prices for items worth over 50,000 gold coins.

"If there's a magical item that can allow you to use the identification spell without spending 100 gold coins, how would you react?" the elderly wizard asked.

"Haha, I would definitely wake up laughing in my sleep," the middle-aged man laughed loudly.

He was completely at ease with the glass soundproofing effect and didn't worry about being overheard by others.

Magical items couldn't be priced openly, and there was a risk of overlooking or misjudging them, as not every item was worth spending 100 gold coins to identify.

There was also the possibility of a failed identification due to damage to the item.

"That copper mirror tube might be such an item," the elderly wizard said, "I only read about it in an ancient text. If the opponent has a shining silver badge, it might actually be that thing."

"A mage's protective eyewear, worth less than 1,000 gold coins, but extremely meaningful to our profession."

When he heard this, the middle-aged man couldn't help but take a deep breath.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu gazed down at the item being inspected by him, saying, "Can I buy this item from the other party for tens of thousands of gold coins?"

I advise you to be cautious," the old wizard said with a sigh. "You can't grasp the opponent's true intentions before that."

"Alright, I'll wait a few days and contact him again. Tonight's item, I'll buy it at the cost price if it's not too late," Zhao Xu said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also smiled satisfactorily.

The effects of this rosary are indeed consistent with the magical item abilities recorded on the sheepskin paper beside it.

This is a "Rosary Necklace" with rosaries that can be used once a day, except for the legendary "Summoning Rosary". The number of rosaries in the necklace is not fixed and is priced according to the specific rosary and type.

Once a rosary is taken out of the necklace, it will lose its unique abilities.

The advantage of carrying this rosary necklace is that it does not occupy a slot in the equipment, and can be used by carrying it with you.

Zhao Xu quickly calculated the price. According to the normal price, the mysterious gemstone of the rosary necklace is worth 1000 gold coins, a magic rosary is worth 9000 gold coins, a wind-riding rosary is worth 20,000 gold coins, and a summoning rosary is worth 4000 gold coins, totaling 43,000 gold coins.

"This rosary necklace is for you, Zhong Xiaofa, our honored guest here. I can give you a discounted price of 86,000 gold coins," Salariz smiled and said.

Zhao Xu's stomach almost churned.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This kind of thing, in the market for magical items, is considered a divine artifact. However, selling it at a price that's double the standard price is a bit too expensive.

He doesn't look like someone who is foolish with money.

'Give me a reasonable price.'

Zhao Xu didn't bother to argue with the other party about how many times he could see.

The sheepskin paper in his hand already had the clear mark of the black market and a description of the actual abilities of this string of rosary beads.

The difference wasn't big, indicating that it was a genuine sale with no false advertising. Even if there were any questions, he could use this marked sheepskin paper to trace it back.

This is also the highest-end black market, with everything priced clearly.

Of course, Zhao Xu couldn't get the "discount" price.

If this were an untested and unguaranteed rosary, he might be able to sell it for over 40,000 gold coins.

However, to him, the 43,000 gold coins premium was too expensive.

The main reason was that this string of rosary beads held special meaning for him.

The two magic rosaries, each worth 9,000 gold coins, could activate his divine magic and increase his spellcasting level by 4 levels for 10 minutes.

Originally level 7 in spellcasting, he could activate the rosary and reach level 11, then sacrifice his physical body to increase his level by 5 levels.

With a level 16 spellcasting level, he could meet the requirements for tattooing and increase his level to 17.

At level 17, he could cast spells that would last for an entire day.

One rosary was for morning buff, and the other was for random response during battle.

This 4-level magic rosary was truly worth its price."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

While the wind-running pearl allows him to possess the ability of "wind-running", a seventh-level spell that enables him to move at a speed of 3 meters per round, approximately, with perfect maneuverability.

Additionally, he can also use another method of movement, which is a super magical wind with a speed of 108 kilometers per hour, every 180 meters.

Currently, he is able to fly, but not too quickly. He can continue to switch between his physical and steam states for 17 hours with a 5-round time cost.

With his quick flight technique and divine footsteps, Zhao Xu's flight method has been greatly supplemented.

The "calling pearl" at the end is used to summon the assistance of his divine spirit. Without a suitable reason, his divine spirit will take away his belongings and he will be punished, possibly with a "compulsion spell" that cannot be resisted.

However, it seems that he and the goddess of magic, Sylvia, have a deep connection, indicating a direct divine assistance. Even after a certain period of time has passed, he still maintains a 13th-level spellcaster level.

"Ah, the magic items here are very affordable, no need to bargain," said Sarazhi, noticing that this mage has no consumption history and therefore cannot get a discounted price.

The black market can provide a loan of 600,000 yuan without interest, and there are ways for him to earn it back.
Here is the translated text:

Just as he was about to use his traditional negotiation skills to convince the other party to accept the price, a sudden thought came to him from the old wizard behind the scenes, who was monitoring their conversation in real-time.

He was taken aback and quickly changed his tone: "However, Mr. Zhongxia, you said it, and it's four thousand three hundred gold coins, okay?"

The rules of the trade, the VIP price, and all the other details were suddenly forgotten in an instant, replaced by the sudden flash of the price cut by Salariz.

Salariz, who had just quoted the price, immediately followed up with a half-price offer.

It was clear that he had just taken the other party for a ride, which was a form of provocation. But the person who sent the message was someone he would never be able to catch up to in ten lifetimes.

Zhao Xu listened in surprise and then smiled.

"It's interesting, can you help me pack it up? Let's settle the bill together."

It seemed that only by sacrificing oneself could one catch a wolf. It appeared that this "magic item" that added value of millions of gold coins to the black market had finally taken effect.
