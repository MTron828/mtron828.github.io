Chapter 234, Third Notebook

After witnessing this scene, everyone couldn't help but converge on the spot, and some even suspected that the ghost had only vanished for a moment. This was because everyone still remembered Crui Lu's words. Even if it was a level 1 monster, once it became a ghost, it would automatically level up to level 5 due to the ghost's inherent abilities.

But no matter how unbelievable it was, the fact remained that Zhang Qi had killed a level 5 monster with a single sword strike. It was as if he had easily dispatched a level 5 monster. However, some people suspected that the ghost might have been eliminated by Pastor Feng, who was present at the scene. After some private discussion, everyone agreed that Pastor Feng was unlikely to have cast a spell at the time.

Then, Zhao Xu's classmates, with his consent, happily took turns to grab a "non-extinguishable torch" each. After the ghost's attack, everyone's anxious thoughts about rushing back to the camp were alleviated. The player team from Winter City, which was heading to "Star Lake", mostly brought along citizens of Arthur. Therefore, it was not advisable for players to log off on their own, leaving them to fend for themselves in the wilderness. As a result, most teams chose to set up camp.

After Crui Lu arranged for the roster of night watchmen, everyone returned to their own tents, and no campfire gathering was held. However, it seemed that the other player team, which was camping about a hundred meters away, was having a singing party all night, with their songs drifting over to our side, as if they were on a leisurely outing.
Although Zhao Xu initially issued the task, most people didn't contribute much during the battle, and some even remained motionless from start to finish, completely intimidated by the ghost. It wasn't until Zhang Qi finally killed the ghost that the scene's atmosphere changed. As for Zhao Xu, he had deliberately set up a separate tent for himself, and he didn't need to take turns with others at midnight.

After entering the tent, Zhao Xu lit the oil lamp hanging from above and finally relaxed. It wasn't Zhang Qi who actually killed the ghost with one sword strike.

In reality, Zhao Xu realized that after he reached level 20 as a priest, making a decision became more complicated. He had more options, but he had to deliberate on which technique to use to eliminate the ghost. As a result, he spent most of his time observing his classmates' true reactions.

When facing a crisis, the ghost demonstrated its power and dared to challenge players who were not afraid to provoke the ghost's wrath. Even those who were not as strong knew they had to shoot a few arrows at the ghost.

So Zhao Xu decided to forgo observing and evaluating his classmates and instead chose to reward Zhang Qi directly. Zhao Xu had completed his evaluation of his classmates, which turned out to be consistent with their future achievements. When Zhang Qi struck the sword, Zhao Xu immediately cancelled his plan to continue observing and evaluating his classmates and chose to reward Zhang Qi directly.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhaoxu was given a 20th-level priest ability by the celestial being, not a scroll ability, so his spell range is limited to priest spells only.

However, he has a bridge in the form of the "Miracle" spell, which is equivalent to the mage's "Blessing" spell.

As a 9th-circle priest spell, "Miracle" can not only summon miracles, such as saving a city from a flood disaster or reviving fallen comrades, but also requires a substantial cost.

Like simulating an 8th-circle priest spell or any 7th-circle spell, it is easy to do so.

Therefore, with five 9th-circle spell slots, Zhaoxu can directly simulate a 6th-circle spell, "Trigger", using "Miracle".

The significance of "Trigger" is that it can compress a spell of no more than 6 circles, allowing Zhaoxu to release the spell with just a thought.

This is also comparable to the mage's "Multitasking" and another stone monument.

However, Zhaoxu used "Trigger" to trigger the 4th-circle spell "Quick Burst".

Naturally, "Quick Burst" is also a mage spell that Zhaoxu simulated using his priest spells.

So, after feeling the ivory carving on his chest, he triggered the prepared "Quick Burst" spell.

In an instant, he entered a state of slow time flow, equivalent to a standard action time.

At that time, he also saw Zhang Qi's sword moving slowly towards the front.

Zhaoxu naturally wouldn't waste the time gained by "Quick Burst".
Here is the translation:

He didn't say a word and simply summoned the limitless, three-ring, holy magic "Justice Hammer" and hurled it at them.

The depths of hell's fiend had eaten three or four "Justice Hammers" from 20-level spellcasters, and they all turned to dust.

As for the original 3rd-level warrior's soul, it took a direct hit and suffered 90 HP in damage, leaving nothing but ashes.

It's like a father beating his son, and that's how powerful the force is.

Therefore, even if someone was observing Zhao Xu at the time, they would not have known that he had just touched the statue on his chest, obtained a moment of time, and completed the spell.

The main reason is that "Rapid Release" is a spell, so Zhao Xu couldn't directly cast it, but could only compress it through "Trigger Art" to cast later.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu wouldn't need to overuse "Trigger Art" and could simply release "Rapid Release" and end the battle immediately.

At this moment, Zhao Xu thought deeply.

Without the specialization in instant spellcasting, he was too passive.

Tomorrow, he would be a warrior-priest, holding a giant scythe and swinging it around.

At that time, he wouldn't be able to casually cast spells like "Time Stop" and then slowly buff himself.

So, he had to go to the legendary library tonight to find a way.

As for Zhao Xu now, when he encounters a problem, his first reaction is to think that he needs to read more books.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's scouting skill alerted him that someone was standing outside the tent.

"Come in?" Zhao Xu whispered softly.

Just then, Florence lightly grasped the curtain of the tent and quietly walked in, having already removed her leather armor and revealing her original beautiful figure.

"You can't tell that you're a priest, we rogues' stealth skills are useless now?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu just smiled and said nothing, as his stealth skill could only reach around 10 levels and would not be effective at all. When she approached the legendary level, with 30 levels of stealth, she would probably be able to rival him now.

"Florence, didn't you say to come to your place at midnight?" Florence asked.

"Yes, Florence Miss," Zhao Xu replied.

Zhao Xu didn't expect Florence to be so bold, with no concern about the previous soul attack and directly entering the main topic.

"The leader asked me to come over to protect you, and also to ask, how much longer will you be staying?"

Zhao Xu was curious about the mysterious tomb located near the "Falling Star Lake" where Florence had been lingering in her past life, and was afraid to get involved in the battle of big shots or entangle herself in the mysterious world. So, he didn't ask Florence about it at the time.

In this life, Zhao Xu had gained the qualification for adventure and naturally had curiosity about Florence's purpose.

"Not true, my father knows that place," Florence exclaimed in surprise.

Zhao Xu had the "Discerning Deception" spell from the Heaven's Servant, which allowed him to detect whether Florence was telling the truth or not, including her intentional attempts to probe him.

Moreover, his skills in reading people and observing expressions could help him constantly infer Florence's intentions.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu dared to come to Florence's place without any information. Zhao Xu paused for a moment, finding that neither the spell nor his skills showed any unusual results, indicating that the leader of the Tangde tribe indeed knew about this matter.

He continued to ask: "The tomb is too mysterious, the leader is worried that you will be delayed."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Furei heard Zhao Xu mention the tomb, and her doubts were dispelled, and she lowered her head to think deeply.

"However, it's also okay. Since you can come to protect me, you're also a core member, so can you take a look?" she said, directly pulling out a piece of paper from her clothes and handing it to Zhao Xu.

"After that, when you're in 'Star Lake' for a day, please pay attention to where this emblem pattern has appeared," she said.

Zhao Xu also smiled slightly, and his goal was finally achieved.

In reality, Furei would do this too, because she would rely on these people to find clues later, and this was just a prelude.

Zhao Xu, as the priest of the goddess, didn't need to be too polite, and he took the paper from her hand and slowly unfolded it.

However, his gaze had already frozen on the paper the moment it fell on it.

This pattern, he had seen it before in the notebook of his ancestor Andi.

He had also seen it in the notebook of his ancestor, the spirit of the dead.

The two notebooks had merged into one, becoming the "Magic Notebook" in his hand.

This was the third time he had seen the mysterious tomb pattern - Thunder strikes the earth, waves of flames.
