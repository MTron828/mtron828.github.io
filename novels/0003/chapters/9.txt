Chapter 10: The Threshold

Zhao Xu found it difficult to describe the thoughts running through his mind as he passed through the transmission portal.

According to his estimation, after obtaining two badges, players would directly receive a job document for the position of a scroll scholar at the Myststrath Mage Association headquarters and continue on this path.

However, when the black-robed mage uttered the words "scroll scholar", Zhao Xu's heart was deeply shaken.

Before this, he had never thought that this profession, which was not inferior to mages and priests, would allow players to interact with it on their first day.

Arthur, this game, is indeed a hot game on earth.

In a more valuable environment, many live streaming players are not stingy about revealing game content and publishing it.

These contents also rely on the internet, without any restrictions on transmission, allowing Zhao Xu, an outsider, to understand.

The main difference between basic professions and advanced professions is that the level of spellcasting of advanced professions can be stacked, but not for basic professions.

Listening to the black-robed mage's words, he was certain that the mage's path would continue uninterrupted.

The question is, as a scroll scholar, would he need to first take on the role of a 1st-level priest and then become a repetitive divine spellcaster?

Taking on a 1st-level priest would mean that his main path as a scroll scholar would forever be one level behind others.

1st-level mages can learn 1st-level spells, 3rd-level mages can learn 2nd-level spells, and so on, with 5th-level mages able to learn 3rd-level spells. Most spellcasting professions follow this pattern.

For example, a 9th-level priest can cast a 5th-level divine revival spell, but he can only play 4th-level spells.

Until Zhao Xu's time passed, he appeared in the floating city, and his entire person had already returned to a state of calm. He had roughly figured out some things.

The goddess's will was said to be very subtle. It was the goddess's will that he become a scholar of the ancient tomes, and it was also the goddess's will that he become a 1st-level cleric.

After Zhao Xu understood this point, he instantly switched his character's faith orientation to the magic goddess Sylvia in an instant.

He was 90% certain that the goddess was watching him from the moment he created his character to the time he selected his profession.

The statues did indeed possess divine power, just as he had suspected.

The gods were planning to select their own followers, and the creation of the sacred hall was underway.

Zhao Xu was chosen, perhaps because of his dual-elite qualifications or maybe for deeper reasons.

Regardless, the goddess needed him to become a cleric, and it was undoubtedly necessary to strengthen their bond.

The clerics in the Arthurian world, due to the reason of the true god, could be said to be practitioners of the divine concept. However, even if someone is a cleric of a god, their devotion is not necessarily unquestionable.

Because their cleric level is a testament given by the gods.

Clerics can be directly granted their profession by the gods.

Therefore, the churches and temples in Arthur's world are deeply trusted by their followers, and their actions are entirely consistent, almost like a true utopia.

Zhao Xu faced this situation and naturally switched his faith to the goddess.

Faith is a very serious matter.

However, the gods are still very lenient towards shallow believers, but they are very strict when it comes to the selection of clerics.
Here is the translation of the text:

With each promotion of a cleric's level, divine recognition is required. If a cleric is rejected by the deity they have faith in, they will lose most of their abilities, including their divine magic. At that time, only the demons from the Abyss and the depths of Hell will accept such apostates. To them, the souls of treacherous clerics are the greatest delicacy. However, there are always exceptions. If a cleric was not absolutely devoted to their deity, they would not have become a high-level cleric. But even giving a 1-level cleric rank might be acceptable for someone who is considered worthy. This is also the reason why he boldly decided to have faith. Otherwise, he might as well have become a scholar of the ancient tomes and forgotten about becoming a 1-level cleric. The deity needs its 1-level cleric to be an anchor, and he needs the deity's blessings to achieve success in the future. As for whether he is a devout believer or not, it depends on the deity's benevolence. If not, he might as well convert to the army of faith. At least four years later, the Northern Region will begin to stir, and the Abyss and Hell will invade again. At that time, Zhao Xu does not dare say he can ensure the safety of his family. It was in a previous era that Zhao Xu was summoned away during a similar turmoil. As a result, his hometown was destroyed by a passing black dragon. The great turmoil that occurred in that era resulted in the deaths of countless people. Many people who had crossed over from Earth, who were only ordinary civilians, were wiped out by that turmoil.

It was then that the entire Earth crossed the population, finally joining the adventurous profession. The non-adventurous professions such as mentors, aristocrats, and experts cooled down to near-freezing temperatures. When Zhao Xu finished these thoughts, his transmission just completed. He slowly walked out and saw that the hall had expanded to ten times its original size. The hall was filled with multiple identical transmission portals, resembling a mausoleum. On one side of the hall, a row of magical guards stood at attention, guarding the order of the hall. Transmission portals occasionally had people emerging from them. On the wall facing the transmission portals, a group of staff members were busy setting up tables. Before Zhao Xu could ask a question, a maid approached him, her appearance refined, causing Zhao Xu to recall the aesthetic standards he had cultivated for eight or nine years. "Respected Magician, please come with me to re-register," she said, standing beside him, waiting for Zhao Xu to make a move. Each portal was accompanied by a guide maid waiting to receive. Thinking about it, it seemed that even a black-robed magician might have come specifically for him, wondering what he looked like. Zhao Xu thought this and felt a chill run down his spine. The maid in front of him was still waiting patiently, without a hint of annoyance. Zhao Xu didn't want to keep people waiting and hurried to follow. As he walked, he asked, "Are those high-ranking magicians also entering through this portal?" Zhao Xu knew that entering through the portal was the safest option, whether for magicians or the defense of the floating city.
Here is the translation of the text:

Misterla spent a huge price to build these floating cities, which, besides serving as satellite cities to the capital, might also be the last bastion of existence.

Magic teleportation is an unattainable existence for others.

However, in high-level battles, it is impossible to ignore.

Zhao Xu had experienced it in a battle once, where a group of high-level adventurers teleported from the sky using the teleportation spell.

The floating city that Zhao Xu knew was extremely vast, but the projection did not fully cover the entire Misterla, and it was said that these floating cities were too high, even for flying creatures to reach.

Naturally, the only way to break through was through teleportation.

"These cities are all trapped in a maze," the maid said, her voice not too loud, just loud enough for Zhao Xu to hear, but not disturbing anyone else.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, as he had never heard of this concept before.

As a player born in Misterla, there were too few of them, and this group was at the pinnacle of the social hierarchy.

He suddenly realized that the explanation in the post about the upgrading of the spell guard was referring to this mark, which served no practical purpose but was used to prove something.

It turned out that a profession's ability could be used to pass through the floating city's maze, which was much more secure.

Because each spell guard was a carefully selected person, especially traitors who would lose their profession's ability.

Zhao Xu sobered up, thinking about this.

It was natural that ancient cities that had been passed down for thousands of years would have their own unique foundation.

Finally, Zhao Xu finally reached the desk in front.

The other party simply verified the authenticity of the recommendation letter and the badge above and handed him a keychain, instructing the maid to take him to his future dormitory and then turn around to greet others.

Zhao Xu listened and followed the maid with a puzzled expression.

Throughout the process, he was wandering around the castle, not even taking a breath of fresh air outside, and had already arrived at the dormitory.

The maid didn't say much and left, leaving Zhao Xu even more confused.

In his past life, he had received warrior training, where he was directly taken to the training ground. A group of muscular men started training, correcting each other's combat positions, and learning how to dodge and counterattack.

Then, after choosing a specialty, they began practicing and activating it.

One after another, it was very compact, and some players could even complete the training and go on a solo adventure outside before sleeping.

It's like Zhao Xu, who didn't explain any courses, was simply taken to his dormitory.

He didn't sleep like Arthur, and what's the point of having a dormitory?

Zhao Xu shook his head, still pushing open his dormitory door and taking a step inside.

Then he stood still.
