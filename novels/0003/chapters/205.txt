Chapter 206: Pursuing Stars

"Is this a clause for jumping levels?" Zhao Xu scanned the content and immediately understood what was going on.

He couldn't help but spit out some sarcastic remarks, "Why didn't they call it the Zhao Xu clause?"

He had never heard of this before in his past life. It was no wonder it was like this.

In general, players would usually advance a level or two ahead, maintaining a one-level gap, and then get caught up by others, and the gap would be eliminated.

After all, this was a real game, and it was impossible to stay ahead for too long.

Even Zhao Xu had to obtain a notebook with effects comparable to a divine artifact to get the effect of jumping a level.

However, he was stunned to find that the post below was even more infuriating.

Undoubtedly, the post from the ID "East City Rong" on the forum, which was suspected to be from a 4th-level player, had already topped the hot topic list, with the heat value constantly approaching the current jumping level clause report.

Moreover, all the posts Zhao Xu had written under the ID "East City Rong" had been re-topped to the hot topic list, including the third and fourth lists.

This also led to a flood of likes, rewards, and forwards for his articles "The Ten Commandments for Newbies" and "The Path of the Mage".

"What's the matter with me? I used to be blind to the mountain, not knowing the game's number one player, and sacrificing my time to write this strategy, and now it's just placed in front of me without being cherished."

"Aren't you talking anymore? Let the ones in front go ahead."

"What is it? That's my position, move away."

Zhao Xu looked at his historical old posts, and most of the latest replies were filled with exaggerated language.
Zhao Xu's original intention was also to leave a source of vitality for future Earth players, so that they could die less. Unexpectedly, when he turned back, he ended up exposing himself.

It was those few words from the young lady that sounded a bit harsh to him. Did she not realize that he was quoting a character's name?

And the posts behind the hot post list were all related to him, such as "The Deeds of the 'Dongcheng Ling' Forum God", "Starting from the Time and Content of Dongcheng Ling's Replies", "The Time of the Ten Commandments and How to Prove Them"...

Zhao Xu shook his head as he watched the scene where he was blown out of proportion.

He directly typed a title on the post - "I am Zhong Xia".

But thinking about it, it was too pretentious, and he didn't have any plans to take players flying recently, so it was basically useless.

After a while, Zhao Xu directly rethought it and started typing on the keyboard - "The Road of the Priest", "The Road of the Warrior".

Although his experience as a priest was not extensive, he was still one of the most knowledgeable among the people present when it came to priests.

On the one hand, his wife in his previous life was an apprentice priest, and on the other hand, after experiencing an adventurous career, Zhao Xu, who also held a high position, had expanded his horizons on the material of priests.

When Zhao Xu posted these two threads, the entire forum was shaken, and countless QQ groups were notifying each other about the new posts from the suspected level 4 high-level player.

However, when everyone suddenly saw Zhao Xu's two posts, they couldn't help but raise huge question marks.

But when they saw the specific content, they couldn't help but take a deep breath.

Priest?
Warrior?
When did the "Dongcheng Ling" God also learn to speak about things he didn't have control over?

The reason why everyone was able to successfully suspect the target of the level 4 mage was precisely because the post "The Road of the Mage" was so amazing.
Here is the translation of the text:

The post has already introduced the details of the 2nd circle of the mage, and many specific operations have been explained in detail. However, at the time, many people thought that there were no 2nd circle mage players, so the content was half-true and half-false.

However, with many mage players leaving comments and thanking the post, and combining it with the reputation of "Dongcheng Luo" beforehand, "Dongcheng Luo" became a symbol of faith.

No one dared to question it. In the previous post, Zhao Xu had read it at least three times, and when someone asked a question, a group of forum mage players would explain it, and even educate those who spoke out of line.

So when Dongcheng Luo posted two new posts, even the old masters of the forum were hesitant to speak up.

As a result, Zhao Xu looked at his two new posts, which were all re-posts and replies. He couldn't help but mutter to himself, "Can I doubt it?"

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile to himself, thinking that the plan to pretend to be a pig to eat a tiger had succeeded, and he was about to select the opponent and start typing. He was going to explain his thoughts and experiences, which were so reasonable.

However, just as Zhao Xu was about to type, he saw a reply from the opponent, saying "Sorry, your post has been deleted."

Zhao Xu was taken aback and immediately went to check the original post, only to find that the person who had questioned him had deleted the post.

Shortly after, the opponent sent a follow-up reply with a thumbs-up, saying that he had re-read the post and found that it was a masterpiece, so he had transformed from a doubter to a believer.

"So what?"
Upon seeing this scene, Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself. Since no one dared to refute, he just continued writing. Half an hour later, he had roughly completed and posted "Nine Ring Spell Certification" on the forum.

"Hey, where did I get the courage to click on this post just now?"

"Same here, Lady Dongcheng just wanted us to know how amazing the mage spells can be, not for us to use them ourselves in the future."

"Excuse me, where did you get this information from? Last time I wanted to borrow a book on third-level spells, I was criticized by the administrator for being too ambitious."

At this point, as the number of replies to the three posts began to steadily increase, there were hardly any comments about him being a level 4 player. As the forum's first major force, warriors were the first to respond to posts by "Lady Dongcheng," eagerly absorbing information without wasting time on pointless discussions.

As for the "Nine Ring Spell" post, it targeted the curiosity of onlookers, giving them another topic to gossip about with their friends who also played Arthur.

After Zhao Xu had successfully changed the rhythm of the conversation, he chose a popular question and answered it based on his personal situation.

"I am male," Zhao Xu wrote without hesitation.

Instantly, numerous players who had been following this question received a notification that "Lady Dongcheng" had personally answered the question. A group of people immediately took out their phones and replied to his answer:

"I understand, there are too many flies around lately."

"Every time I think about the fact that the first mage is a female player, I feel much better."

"Please, great master, take me with you. I'm really dying here."

Seeing the topic veering off track again, Zhao Xu could only stand up and give up on continuing the conversation.
Here is the translation of the text:

In this world, there are always some people who can talk a topic to death. However, he was quite satisfied with the effect tonight, and basically listed the shortcomings and points to be noted of the warriors.

This way, I can save several people. If the warriors can reach level 7 or 8, they can actually present some value and barely get resurrected.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh.

Seeking help from others is less effective than seeking help from oneself. Even if he's not level 10 yet, he won't bother saving anyone.

At this time, Zhao Xu reopened his account information list and was about to clear the series of invitations and add friends.

Suddenly, he noticed an account with a avatar hanging above it, which was none other than his classmate, Cui Lu.

Zhao Xu was stunned and agreed without hesitation, then quickly cleared the rest.

"Ahh, ahh. East City's sister-in-law, you're actually adding me? I'm so excited!" The person on the other side immediately sent a message.

It was clear that she had set East City's account information to special attention.

"Ah, okay."

Zhao Xu felt a bit uncomfortable with the other person's enthusiastic emotion. In his previous life, he had never seen Cui Lu's private side.

When he saw the other person's fan-like behavior, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of broken impressions.

"Miss, Miss, can I ask you a question?" Cui Lu further said directly.

Zhao Xu saw these words and felt a bit allergic, but he didn't say much and just replied with a "?".
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It seemed like a rumor, but Zhao Xu immediately typed out "Not true." Just as he was about to send it, he suddenly deleted it. "Oh, I'll keep it a secret," said Liu Lu, although she didn't know why the other party was unwilling to acknowledge it on the forum. However, as a fan, supporting the other party's decision was something that fans could do.

"East City Sister, are you having a hard time living?" Liu Lu thought for a moment. In theory, reaching level 4 meant that they would spend most of their time playing games, 24 hours a day. This kind of reversal of day and night was extremely damaging to women's skin, so she was worried that the other party might be struggling financially.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu replied, a bit taken aback.

"Ha ha, I'm just supporting you," Liu Lu typed.

Ah? Zhao Xu felt a sense of confusion. He had already vaguely heard the phrase "Your sugar baby has been completed" whispered in his ear.

At this point, Zhao Xu also thought back to the time he sent Liu Lu to school in a luxurious car and the rumors about her wealthy family background.

He struggled to suppress his smile as he typed on the keyboard: "Elementary school students should focus on studying and not blindly chase celebrities."

At this point, Liu Lu, sitting in front of the screen, looked at Zhao Xu's expression and couldn't help but reveal a worried look, knowing that Feng Xiao Yue and she had said that as fans and idols, they were "complete strangers, relying on me to spend money" on their relationship.

How did it suddenly become this dramatic?

After doing all these things, Zhao Xu also climbed back into bed.

Legend has it that there are still books waiting for him to read in the library.
