Although Eriton's family still had a considerable fortune, his fingertips trembled slightly when he heard that, almost losing his grip. The shield pin, which had a limited use and could only resist magic missiles, cost 1500 gold coins, far beyond what the two of them had imagined.

"This pin naturally has its own significance. The normal shield spell only lasts for 1 minute per level," explained Zhao Xu.

For the current players, with a general level of 1st level mage, if they cast the "shield spell," it would only last for 1 minute. Zhao Xu, a 12th level spellcaster, could make the spell last for 12 minutes, still very short. However, he could make the spell last for a whole day if the range was limited to "self."

It was precisely because the "shield spell" was limited to mages being able to cast it on themselves, unlike mage armor which could be cast on teammates, that Zhao Xu had to provide these items.

After listening to Zhao Xu's explanation, Eriton pondered for a moment and said, "Then I choose to use scrolls."

“Why?” Zhao Xu immediately asked.

Eriton awkwardly scratched his head and said, "On one hand, scrolls are the cheapest option. Compared to using energy spells with a staff, the one-time cost is more worthwhile than using up the 'shield pin.'"

“On the other hand, I think you, as the captain, also want to test us. If you cast immunity spells on us, then it loses its meaning,” Eriton added.

Zhao Xu remained silent and turned to look at Zheng Xinyun.

"Me?"

Although Zheng Xinyun had not been exposed to the game content for a long time, through the introduction of her close friend, she began to understand that this was probably the "test" from an NPC as spoken in the legend.
It even concerns whether the players can unlock the "advanced" and "expertise" and obtain the key to inheritance.
Players who cannot rely on any blood relationship can only unlock more content by relying on the appreciation of the Arthur NPC.
At this time, her thoughts in her mind kept bursting and recombining.
Zheng Xinyun already wanted to play this game "Arthur" well, and the resilience in her nature began to sprout.
She didn't want to waste this opportunity to answer easily.
Zhao Xu looked at Zheng Xinyun's contemplation and felt a little strange.
Because no matter what Zheng Xinyun answered, she would not be vetoed by Zhao Xu.
Compared to Eliot next to her, Zheng Xinyun could be considered his "own person," so her treatment was naturally different.
Just as Zhao Xu was ready to give a hint, Zheng Xinyun slowly said, "I will choose 'Minor Spell Immunity'."
As she said this, she looked up at Zhao Xu, as if her eyes were shimmering, "To be honest, I'm not confident that I can successfully use the 'Shield Spell' scroll, and in terms of value, the Shield Spell itself is an arcane magic for mages, and now it appears in the form of a divine spell scroll, which is probably quite expensive."
"The duration of the spell is also very important. Besides the needle that can be worn continuously, the core of the scroll and the wand is still the Shield Spell, so it cannot escape the restriction of the duration in minutes. The introduction of the 'Minor Spell Immunity' written on this paper states that the duration is 10 minutes per level, so with you as the captain at level 12, it can last for a full two hours, enough to cover the time we come into contact with that old witch."
Zhao Xu nodded as he listened to this analysis.
The scroll of divine magic "Shield Spell" was transcribed by Zhao Xu at noon in a quiet room nearby. After reaching level 6, coupled with the "Life Energy" feedback from the "Item Magic Pet" cloak, he transcribed the scroll without any hesitation. He could afford to burn it, and since he didn't have to transcribe it himself, he could use the "Automatic Stenography Quill" to help. Recently, Zhao Xu would transcribe a scroll from time to time to enrich his own reserves and avoid being left powerless due to the exhaustion of spell slots.

Zhao Xu was quite satisfied with Zheng Xinyun's current response. In his past life, Zheng Xinyun had obtained abilities during his probationary period as a priest, but lost his professional support and gradually faded away. After the two met and got together, Zheng Xinyun focused more on managing the family's business, planning to help Zhao Xu develop a family with a solid foundation.

In terms of combat, she had never expressed any opinions. However, Zhao Xu understood that her pre-combat analysis was basically satisfactory.

Although Zheng Xinyun's current analysis was still very simple, in reality, mages and priests had to make countless such analytical decisions in the blink of an eye.

Compared to the warrior profession, the kind of momentum they had, charging forward without hesitation, was different. Mages and priests had to consider many more combat details and make many more combat decisions.

"Alright, when we're almost at our destination, I'll cast 'Minor Spell Immunity' on you," Zhao Xu made his next arrangement, "and at the same time, make sure to bring that pin with you."

"Huh?"

Seeing the two's surprised looks, Zhao Xu explained, "You have to bring it, life is always worth more than 1500 gold coins."
The Arthurian indigenous people, like Elidon, only have one life, which goes without saying. 
Zheng Xinyun, who can be resurrected, has not yet realized this. If there were other players present, they would definitely scoff at Zhao Xu's words. They would be willing to sacrifice their lives to keep the 1500 gold coin shield pin. 
Based on the current poverty line of players, they would rather sacrifice five resurrection stones from their accounts than waste 1500 gold coins. 
Even if their accounts were permanently banned, it would still be worth it for this transaction. 
In reality, the duration of the shield spell is too short. Otherwise, Zhao Xu would have suggested that they both use a wand to cast "Shield" on themselves. The defense boost from a 4th-level shield spell is substantial. 
Like him, Zhao Xu had already cast the spell "Shield" on himself before leaving. Coupled with the recent "Mage Armor," he had a total of 8 levels of defense. Zhao Xu was quite sturdy. 
Ordinary players, unless wearing magical armor, would only have a 7th-level defense at most with top-notch full-body armor, and there were restrictions on wearing and armor flexibility. 
Moreover, under Zhao Xu's influence, the duration of these two spells was extremely long, making Zhao Xu's current defense capabilities among the best in the player community. 
Even a normal level 1 player who just entered the game would have little chance of success in attacking Zhao Xu with a "thin sword." 
Because any random stab would be blocked by Zhao Xu's force field armor and force field shield. 
At this moment, Zhao Xu, after obtaining the professional ability of "Super Magic Control," finally began to stack his "static defense" ability.
Leaving aside the rest, at least "Mage Armor" and "Shield Spell" can be considered as his morning buffs. The duration of this static defense has been long enough to cover most of his time. Meanwhile, the carriage rolled on with its wheels clattering, continuously moving towards its destination. Zhao Xu reached out and pushed aside the curtain, the coachman was concentrating on handling the horses in front of him, without paying attention to him. "Is there anything unusual?" Zhao Xu keenly sensed the coachman's condition and asked quietly. "Sir, nothing, just feels like there are fewer people on this post road than usual," the coachman frowned. "Really?" Elidon immediately added, "Mistral is very safe, generally powerful monsters don't dare to approach easily." Thinking of the two previous encounters with the first major breeding species of goblins, Zhao Xu just sneered and did not argue. Well, those experiences could be considered his bad luck. "However, my lord mage, there have been rumors of haunting in the town of Frost Dew recently. The church has sent priests to investigate, but they haven't found anything unusual. However, there have been fewer people traveling to exchange goods recently, I don't know if it's because of this reason," the coachman immediately chatted about his usual observations. Hearing this, Zhao Xu subconsciously signaled for his "Soul Imprisonment" undead creature to come closer.
