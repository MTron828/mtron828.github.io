Chapter 353: Battle Choice

"This golden pin is a 'Shield Pin', and it can absorb 101 MP magic bullet energy when attached to the chest."
"This protective staff can be held in hand to cast the 'Shield' spell."
"This paper with the 'Secondary Magic Immunity' spell has no magical properties at all. It's just to help you understand this spell, because I can cast this spell to make you immune to 'Magic Bullets'."
"As for the 'Shield' spell scroll, it allows you to cast this spell yourself."
Zhao Xuzhi explained the usage and significance of these items in just a few words.

Ultimately, the 'Shield' spell can increase the defense value of the caster by four levels, similar to Zheng Xin'an's 'Scaly Shirt' or Zhao Xuzhi's 'Mage Armor' spell.
It also has another powerful use, allowing the caster to be immune to the 'Magic Bullet' spell.

Under the threat of the four magic bullets fired by the Old Witch, which can knock out any 1st-level civilian, this has crucial significance.

"What method do you plan to choose?" Zhao Xuzhi asked.

"How much does this pin cost?" Elliot stretched out his hand and picked up one of the pins, holding it up in front of the window to observe it carefully.

"1,500 gold coins," Zhao Xuzhi estimated the price of the pin when he borrowed it from the Mage Association. If he returned it in its original state, he would naturally not have to pay any compensation as a member of the Shining Secret Silver Badge.
Although Elon's family had a significant amount of wealth, he still trembled slightly when he heard the words, and almost couldn't hold on.

The magical shield needle that could only resist magic bullets and had a limited range was surprisingly priced at 1500 gold coins, far exceeding the imagination of the two.

"This magical needle has its own significance," Zhao Xu explained.

For ordinary wizards, the duration of a basic shield spell was only one minute per level. However, as a 12th-level wizard like Zhao Xu, he could keep the spell going for 12 minutes, which was still relatively short.

However, he could make the spell last all day by using the "Spell Duration" skill directly.

It was because the shield spell was limited to the wizard only being able to cast it on themselves, unlike the wizard's armor that could be cast on teammates, that Zhao Xu provided these items.

After hearing Zhao Xu's question, Elon hesitated for a moment, "I'll choose the scroll instead."

"Why?" Zhao Xu asked immediately.

Elon looked embarrassed and scratched his head, "On one hand, scrolls are the cheapest option, and the cost of using a spellbook is much higher than the cost of using a shield needle."

"On the other hand, I think you're testing us. If you cast an immunity spell on us, it would negate the significance of our own shields."

Zhao Xu listened without comment, then turned to Zheng Xin Yu.

"I?" Zheng Xin Yu, although she had not played the game for a long time, had a basic understanding of the game content through her friend's introduction, and suspected that this was the legendary "test" from an NPC.
The translation of the text is as follows:

It's crucial for players to unlock "advanced" and "specialized" skills to obtain the key to inheritance. Without any blood ties, players can only rely on Arthur NPCs to unlock more content. At this moment, her thoughts are constantly bursting and recombining in her mind.

Zheng Xin'an has already decided to play this "Arthur" game, and her innate resilience is starting to emerge. She doesn't want to waste this opportunity to answer.

As Zhao Xu watched Zheng Xin'an's contemplation, he felt a strange sensation. No matter what Zheng Xin'an answered, he wouldn't reject it. Compared to Ellenton beside him, Zheng Xin'an could be considered his "own person", and therefore treated differently.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to give some hints, Zheng Xin'an slowly opened her mouth and said, "I'll choose 'Secondary Magic Immunity'."

As she spoke, she raised her head to look at Zhao Xu, as if her eyes were rippling with waves of blue, "To be honest, I don't have confidence in using 'Shield Magic' smoothly, and from a value perspective, Shield Magic is a high-level spell. Now it's appearing as a divine scroll, which is likely to have a high cost."

"Moreover, the duration of the spell is also crucial. Besides being able to wear it continuously, the scroll and staff core are still Shield Magic, so they can't be separated from minute-level duration limits. As for the 'Secondary Magic Immunity' introduction on this paper, the duration is 10 minutes per level, and by the time you reach level 12, you can maintain it for two hours, which is enough to cover the time period we encounter the old witch."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu took out the "Shield Technique" scroll and sat down in a quiet room. After reaching level 6, he added the "Life Force" from the "Treasure of the Magical Creatures" cloak and began to transcribe the scroll with ease.

He was able to transcribe the scroll quickly and effortlessly, without any hesitation. With the help of his "Automatic Quill", Zhao Xu was able to transcribe multiple scrolls, enriching his own reserves and avoiding the depletion of his magical energy.

Zheng Xin, who had previously lost his purpose as a clergyman, had spent his apprenticeship gaining abilities that gradually disappeared over time. After meeting again, Zheng Xin focused more on managing his family's business and planned to help Zhao Xu develop a family with a solid foundation.

In terms of combat, Zheng Xin had not expressed any opinions. However, Zhao Xu had already understood that Zheng Xin's combat analysis was basically qualified.

Although Zheng Xin's analysis was still simple, it was necessary for a mage or clergyman to make countless such decisions. Compared to warriors, mages and clergy needed to consider many combat details and make many decisions.

"Ah, we're almost there, I'll cast 'Secondary Magic Immunity' on you," Zhao Xu said, making his next move. "And bring that needle along."

"Ah?" Zheng Xin and the other person looked at each other in surprise.

Zhao Xu explained, "Don't bring it; life is worth more than 1500 gold coins."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Eliot's kind of reincarnation only happens once, and it's obvious that the native inhabitants of the land of Arthur wouldn't need to say anything. However, Zheng Xin, who can be revived, has not yet realized this moment, and if there are other players present, they will definitely ridicule Zhao Xu's words and choose not to waste 1500 gold coins for the shield needle. From the current player's poverty line, it's basically too expensive for most players to sacrifice their account's five revival stones for the sake of 1500 gold coins.

Even if their account is permanently banned, they can still get this money. In fact, the duration of the shield spell is too short, and Zhao Xu would also suggest that the two use the staff to cast the shield spell on themselves, with a 4-level boost in shield defense. Like him, he had already cast the shield spell on himself before leaving, and combined with the recent "Mage Armor", Zhao Xu's defense has increased by 8 levels.

Except for players who wear magical armor, even the top-tier full-body armor can only provide 7 levels of defense, with limitations in terms of wearability and flexibility. Moreover, these two spells under Zhao Xu's influence have an extremely long duration, making Zhao Xu's current defense ability a standout among players. Even a 1-level player who just started playing the game, wielding a "Fine Sword", would have a hard time defeating Zhao Xu.

Because Zhao Xu's power field armor and power shield can easily block any attack from the opponent. At this moment, Zhao Xu, who has mastered the "Super Magic Control" profession skill, has finally begun to stack his own "Static Defense" ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without saying anything else, let's just say that "Magician's Shield" and "Shield Spell" are at least a decent morning buff for him.

The maintenance time for this static defense has already been long enough to cover most of his time.

Meanwhile, the carriage is rolling along, constantly moving towards its destination.

Zhao Xu pushed open the carriage curtain and found the coachman in front, seriously arranging the horses in front of him, without a moment's distraction to ask him.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu sensed the coachman's situation and asked quietly.

"No, nothing's wrong, it just feels like there are fewer people on this road compared to usual," the coachman frowned and said.

"Not that bad?" Elton immediately followed up and said, "Mistra is generally very safe, and powerful monsters wouldn't dare to approach easily."

Remembering the previous two times he went out and encountered the attacks of the goblins, Zhao Xu just shrugged his shoulders and didn't refute.

Well, those experiences were just his bad luck.

"However, Magician Sir, there have been rumors of ghostly disturbances in Frosty Town recently. The Church has sent a bishop to investigate, but they didn't find anything unusual. However, it's true that fewer people have been passing through the town, and I don't know if it's related to this."

As soon as he heard these words, Zhao Xu subconsciously signaled for his "undead creature" to get closer.
