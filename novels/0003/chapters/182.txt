Chapter 183 Target Altar
At this time, the middle-aged mage who had advanced to become a "spell guardian" also looked puzzled, his gaze lingering on Reian and Zhao Xu, secretly wondering if the young mage in front of him had really deduced it himself, rather than being revealed by Reian.
By now, Zhao Xu's eyes had become even brighter, and the entire logical chain in his mind had connected in an instant.
The dopamine secreted from successfully deducing the result instantly swept away the feeling of frustration he had when witnessing the deaths of the four young men and women.
"Let's go back to the beginning of the problem. It's understandable that the 'Abyssal Forge' didn't go back to Mysteria, but why did they act here, and even after killing four people, there are no traces left."
Ordinary people might not be able to handle it, but with devilish means, even if it were hundreds of people, the other party would have the ability to conceal those bodies.
"Chaotic evil demons cannot be predicted in their choices, but when a lawful devil does this, it can only be attributed to the fact that they have no choice."
At this point, Zhao Xu's eyes were full of confidence, and the other priests and the three floating city spell guardians present were all looking at him, waiting for his next words.
At this time, Reian was slightly lowering his head, pondering Zhao Xu's words.
"It could have easily controlled Andy and chosen to escape directly using 'advanced teleportation'. But with these four people present, and with me witnessing, it couldn't hide its tracks and take Andy away. Even if, as per my request, they all went to the church of the goddess, it would pose a great risk for the devil. Even if it secretly killed those four people, one of them is the son of the secretary of the Mysterla Government Office, which would definitely attract an investigation."

"So it simply used the four people as sacrifices, creating a massacre that would be discovered, spreading fear to unleash the power to support this ritual that could hide its location. As for choosing the area near the stream, I guess it's to expand the range of the ritual."

"This also indicates that the range covered by this ritual is definitely limited, and the 'Abyssal Demon' is hidden in the surrounding area," Zhao Xuduo said confidently.

At this point, Lei An deliberately shook his head, "Not necessarily, this kind of hidden ritual can only last for a period of time. As time passes, that hidden power will eventually disappear, and then the 'Abyssal Demon' will no longer have the power to shield its 'perception of location'."

"This just delays its exposure time by ten days or half a month."

Zhao Xuduo smiled when he heard this. If he hadn't realized that the duration of the ritual was limited, he might have questioned himself. But he had already seen through this from the beginning, and this would also be a strong piece of evidence for his speculation.

"This means that there must be a relevant demon altar nearby," Zhao Xuduo said, but he noticed that everyone around him remained calm.

At this moment, with a clear mind, he suddenly understood.

The 'Rose Cross' had experienced similar cases!

"Clap, clap, clap." Lei An couldn't help but clap his hands, and at this moment, he looked at Zhao Xuduo with a serious expression, no longer the casual look he had at the beginning.
"In the dawn era of 1724, the prince of the Casa Empire disappeared. At the time, it was discovered that the twenty attendants who were following him had all been brutally murdered, and their blood had stained the nearby stream red. It was also the time when a 'deep prison demon' used slaughter as a ritual, hiding in the underground altar nest of the hunting ground. It was only after the intervention of the legendary mage that the existence of the 'deep prison demon' was captured."

Lei An looked satisfied as he gazed at Zhao Xu, "Now your performance is coming to a temporary end, and it's up to me from here on."

After saying this, he looked at his subordinates with determination, "Contact the Mistral City Guards. Search a 20-mile radius centered around this stream for me."

...

Zhao Xu gently took off the VR simulation helmet and got out of bed.

It was almost two or three in the morning, and the power lights on Zhang Qi and Chen Sinan's VR helmets had already gone out, flashing standby lights.

This indicated that they were also asleep at the moment, just without taking off their helmets. Another roommate, Liu Hanqiang, was making a slight snoring sound.

Zhao Xu tiptoed to the balcony of the dormitory, turned on the tap to allow a small amount of water to flow, and splashed some on his face to wake himself up.

The balcony of the dormitory was not large, with a sink and a washing machine purchased jointly by Zhao Xu and his three roommates on the left, and the door to the toilet and bathroom on the right. The open space in the middle was about three square meters.

Zhao Xu leaned gently on the balcony's stone railing, looking through the lush branches of the front banyan tree. The female dormitory opposite was all dark, immersed in darkness.

The world was filled with silence.

Zhao Xu recalled that in the next two days, the "Rose Cross" would gather forces to search the entire area. Even Wang Ningwei's mage team, which had originally gone to kill bandits, would be called back online tomorrow and directly participate in the search for the devil's altar.

Of course, they were not going to participate in hunting the devil, only to find traces of the altar.
