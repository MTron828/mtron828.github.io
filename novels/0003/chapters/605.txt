Chapter 606: Adventure Status, Yana's Future Framework

Although Zhao Xu had pulled his hat down, covering most of his face, the half-exposed facial features were still tightly bound to the three sisters.

They were well aware that they were not the type of inexperienced, naive high school girls who didn't know much about the world.

They didn't have a strong sense of beauty and couldn't understand why they were attracted to the other party.

Because they didn't know that Zhao Xu had applied the "Devil's Pride" and "Beautiful Soul" and "Siren's Blessing" three major spells, boosting his charm by 12 points.

Not to mention that the "Beautiful Soul" spell was essentially a massive beautification of Zhao Xu's appearance, and his good looks were already insufficient to describe his facial features.

Although Zhao Xu didn't rely on his looks to eat, he wouldn't resist such things, and he could even subtly sense the power of his current appearance from the sisters' attitudes.

Looking good is indeed the first key to social mobility.

After the official crossover of all people in the next dimension, the attributes of the three dimensions and the invisible exemption will officially manifest their true strength to everyone.

"Have you not heard of the Law of the Mage?" the female mage asked, raising her head as if borrowing light to look around.

"This is a summary of our mage players' experience, one of which is that - unless unnecessary, do not waste spell slots."

"Oh, and what's next? Please prepare multiple copies, okay?"

"Yes, the next one is the East City's strategy post, oh, should I say, the lord of the current era, Yana, who has just published a supplementary strategy post related to this topic."
Here is the translation of the text:

Lady Clearwater mentioned the name "Zhongxia" with a hint of pride.

Players are not like ordinary Earthlings who are cut off from information. They naturally understand that the living environment in Zhongxia is far better than that of other camps.

At this time, people living in Zhongxia are aware that if Zhongxia really becomes the dominant force in the wilderness, it will unify all human beings on Earth under its control. In that case, Zhongxia would definitely be the "capital".

As for what kind of treatment one could expect under the emperor's rule, that's self-evident.

Zhao Xu was also reminded of this.

This is a strategy post that was voted on by players later on. It can be said that the entire post is a chronicle of the bitter struggles of a low-level mage.

At the time, Zhao Xu had already reached level 9 and mastered the "latent potential" skill. The post was no longer relevant to him, or rather, it was not suitable for his situation.

However, he still wrote a special guide on "what to prepare" for the skill "using magical devices" shared by mages, druids, and warlocks. This guide would help players think about which scrolls to prepare when facing expensive ones.

For example, spells like "dispel" are extremely important when facing negative status effects. Players may not get to use them for 10-20 days, so it's better to prepare a few crucial scrolls to save one's life.

As for defensive spells, even from an adventurer's perspective, it's necessary to always carry a magic wand.

However, all of this has nothing to do with Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

He didn't need to choose what magic to remember, and his magic reserve was endless. This was also the reason why he couldn't summarize the "essence of a mage" in such a loud and boastful post.

"Don't bother with these things, I've brought enough scrolls and wands to consume," Zhao Xu said, then continued walking forward.

At this moment, it was not just his appearance that exuded a certain charm, but also the quiet determination that drove the three sisters to follow his pace.

"Although considering the danger of carrying torches, you wouldn't even bring one?" Zhao Xu joked.

"Usually, we go on adventures in teams, so we don't bother preparing individually," the smallest of the three sisters, Qingyu, explained awkwardly.

As a wilderness survival expert, Qingyu was used to using magic to improvise, and without it, she was just like a warrior without a weapon.

Zhao Xu didn't bother explaining and just understood that these three sisters, with their outstanding physical appearance, must have had their share of "tongue-wagging" fans during their daily gaming.

Some groups even had a significant number of "tongue-wagging" fans, who would send direct messages with provocative photos, trying to stir up a storm, and then boasting about their worthiness to be tongue-wagged.

This made Zhao Xu feel a bit uncomfortable when brushing through the group comments.

"That means you're prepared with sleeping bags, bronze bells, and winter woolen blankets?" Zhao Xu asked, referring to the simplest three items for a night's rest without a tent, which were also the most basic necessities.

The three sisters remained silent.

Now, players can return to Earth and sleep without logging off.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the past, players who refused to venture out at night and stayed indoors, now have to accept the risk of being ambushed at night. Without the "Magic Alarm" spell, setting up a simple bell alarm to ward off wild beasts is still necessary, but it's essential to disassemble it to prevent noise during walking.

Zhao Xū felt that it was inconvenient to turn his head occasionally and used the "Turtle Vision" spell to get a 360-degree view. However, the cost was that he couldn't turn away from the attack and had to face it head-on.

"You say that things like pulleys, iron hooks, and iron bars are unnecessary, but things like flintstones, steel mirrors, and ropes are still essential to bring," Zhao Xū advised.

He even brought along unusual items like fishing nets, manacles, and whetstones.

After obtaining the "Four-dimensional Bag" and distributing a large amount of weight, Zhao Xū basically had a complete set of adventure gear, including climbing tools, disguise tools, and medical bags. Although magic could replace some of these items, he still brought them all.

"We want to, but in this desolate land, all resources have been unified and collected, and even money can't buy adventure supplies, let alone many of them," Patrol Guest Qingyu said.

Hearing this, Zhao Xū couldn't help but smile, because the collection order was one he had signed and issued.

At present, except for player-owned items, other produced goods have no chance to be sold on the market, and only some secret black markets are still in operation.

This is also the price Zhao Xū paid to raise the livelihood of tens of millions of people in Ailanan.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, without replenishing supplies, relying on previously accumulated resources would not last long.

After exploring this underground area, he needs to focus on managing the territory besides mastering the "Nine Swords".

But he thought that, before crossing the border, the three sisters behind him had prepared no supplies, and even after crossing, it was all due to his sister's reason. As a result, they had brought no adventure supplies.

As for the former game items, they were separated by heaven and earth, and everyone was facing the need to consume real gold and silver. The items that were once insignificant had become priceless, and it was impossible to give them up easily.

It was only later that he realized why the other side had not applied for official supplies. As the nominal leader of the Niu family, he wanted to go and apply for supplies, but he was hesitant.

The crossing had only occurred two or three weeks ago, and everything was in a state of utter chaos, making it impossible to make rational predictions.

"Ah?" Suddenly, the elder sister, Qing Li, asked curiously, "Mr. Lone Star, you seem to be deeply moved."

"No," he replied with a smile.

"I'm just thinking that we need to do some homework to realize the gap," he said vaguely, but in reality, he was preparing to start preparing for the "market" and limitedly releasing all supplies to the outside world.

When the ships he had ordered arrived at the edge of the wilderness via the Eternal Winter River, Niu would be able to sell the goods produced in the camp and purchase food seeds from the outside world.

As it's almost autumn harvest season, it's too late to plant crops, so Niu's food supply will have to be delayed until next year.

The idea that Zhao Xu had previously held was naturally based on the power of the gods, allowing the humans on the earth to disperse and grow wild in the wilderness.
Here is the translation:

After enduring the unimaginable hardships for a year, he finally managed to reunite the majority of the original planetary forces, just like King Qiandu Wang from the previous era. Of course, what he didn't say was that he was using the "difficult environment" to quietly eliminate the burden of population. He then used the "federal" framework to wrap around people of different skin colors and ethnic groups, just like a cart that's about to collapse can still manage to drive on the road. Now that he has received the blessing of the goddess and has a fertile piece of land, he, who previously sheltered millions of people, is now thinking of building a powerful city and gradually expanding it. What he wants is a land that has preserved a vast number of Earth humans to be a wilderness.
