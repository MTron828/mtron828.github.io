Chapter 540 Assessment of Spell Guard
At the mention of this, Zheng Xinyun, who was sitting on the small boat, also turned her pretty face and looked back at Zhao Xu. Under her curved eyelashes were sparkling eyes.
She didn't expect that the speculation of when Zhong Xia could break through to level 9 and reach the fifth ring, which was being discussed by many players, would be witnessed by herself on the spot.
Players who speculated that Zhong Xia would break through this month had already lined up in the forum.
Many even speculated that Zhong Xia had already used up all five of her resurrection stones and dared not take the risk again, so naturally she couldn't level up.
But did the other party really break through so easily while flipping through the books?
Zheng Xinyun stared at the book "Mystela's Spell Guard: A Secret History, Song of Blood and Fire" in Zhao Xu's hand with wide eyes.
Is it really so magical?
Could it be the legendary blessing book that can level up people on the spot?
But as Zheng Xinyun silently repeated the name of the book, she couldn't sense any mystery about it.
She was a priest trained by Mystela and knew very well that she could only join the town guard organization after undergoing a sufficient amount of time for assessment in the local area.
Mystela, as the most magnificent jewel south of the Tianduan Mountains, was home to countless legendary mages.
But once it showed a vulnerability that could be invaded, even the immensely powerful gods would be tempted by it.
Even the gods understood this, and to shake the magic system of the Siservina, Mystela was an absolute immovable rock.
There were even rumors in the streets that Siservina had left behind a precious "magic god fragment" deep in the floating city, which was extremely valuable to mages.
As long as they obtain it, the wizard spellcasters do not need to prepare spells anymore, they can use what they have learned. The mysteries after the legend will also be revealed. Therefore, in the realm of power under the gods, there are many malicious eyes focused on Mysteria. Evil dragons, exiled demigods, and undead kings buried deep underground constantly seek to bring down the most brilliant gem on the magic crown. However, the clever Zheng Xinyun immediately realized. The spell guard is the advanced route chosen by Zhong Xia. At this time, Sisylvina's whole body was in a virtual state, appearing and disappearing as if in another dimension. "Goddess, you didn't just come to the mortal world to say hello to us, did you?" Zhao Xu asked. The last time he was forced to the end by the demon lord Grazt, and was trapped in that cramped space, the goddess only appeared to block him with her divine grace. At that time, Zhao Xu was still in the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, and he had such a unique treatment. "Is it strange?" Sisylvina smiled slightly, her voice ethereal and enchanting, making people involuntarily intoxicated. "Isn't the answer in the book in your hand?" Zhao Xu's gaze fell on the book in his hand, and he had already turned to the last page. After the author of the book explained the glorious history of the spell guard, he finally revealed the advanced requirements. [Faction: Any non-evil Skill: Concentration level 8, Spell identification level 5 Specialization: Combat casting, any super magic specialization Casting: Able to cast fourth-level arcane spells Special: Candidates must pass the training assessment of the spell guard organization and have a guarantor].
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu flipped through the page, but couldn't find any necessity for the goddess Sylvia to appear.

He only saw Sylvia laughing, "Isn't the guarantor mentioned above?"

Zhao Xu didn't react yet, but Zheng Xinan was taken aback, looking at Zhao Xu's eyes with a strange expression.

It was unexpected for the goddess to come personally to act as the guarantor.

This mom is not bad at all.

After a long time, Zhao Xu finally answered with difficulty: "Not necessary, Your Highness. I'm just joining a regular guardian organization."

"Regular?"

Sylvia's gentle and melodious laughter suddenly turned cold. "You look down on my 'Magical Guardian' organization?"

Zhao Xu almost slapped his thigh in surprise, pointing at the monk and cursing.

However, the final scroll was unclear, and Zhao Xu was confused.

Sitting across from the goddess Sylvia, Zhao Xu's inner thoughts were instantly revealed. "Idiot."

"The final scroll has been preserved since ancient times by Anniya, and this organization can't be mine, since I'm only the third goddess in my current form."

"The 'Magical Guardian' organization I founded to protect the safety of Mistral is indeed my own creation."

Sylvia said with a smile, covering her mouth.

"Since you want to join a guardian organization, I, the founder of this organization, will examine you. Isn't that only natural?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu finally raised his head, surprised.

No wonder Sylvia's reputation surpasses the second-generation goddess. This person has directly established an organization, created a profession, and combined the legendary magic of "Mistral" with the defensive magic of "Locking Mechanism".
Becoming an "Arcane Guardian" gives you the opportunity to synchronize with the "Barrier" guarding Mysteria. This allows you to cast spells within the city that involve magic (teleportation), magic (summoning), evil descriptions, and death descriptions. Otherwise, even powerful mages in Mysteria can only travel on foot or by carriage.

"Your Highness, this is my honor," Zhao Xuxu humbly nodded.

As he spoke, he raised his eyes and curiously asked, "Your Highness, have you also joined the Final Scroll?"

"Of course, the 'Secret Keeper' of the Final Scroll is me," Silvina said.

"Hmm?" Zheng Xinyun, who had excellent perception attributes, noticed Zhao Xuxu's slight tremor without him deliberately disguising it, and couldn't help but look at him with concern.

Zhao Xuxu cast a comforting look at Zheng Xinyun and said, "I am also the 'Secret Keeper' of this generation's Final Scroll."

"Oh."

An invisible thread seemed to have connected all the clues from the very beginning.

After the lingering emotions in Zhao Xuxu's heart had calmed down, he glanced at his character card panel, which had already reached level 9.

However, he hadn't yet decided on the specific advanced career choice for reaching level 9.

If he didn't decide soon, he would inadvertently advance the levels of the mage and scroll scholar, wasting the additional advantages of the advanced career.

This was the reason why Zhao Xuxu had been accumulating strength and waiting patiently, rather than hastily reading spell books to ascend quickly.

It was just like the story of the old man losing his horse - several months of effort had allowed Zhao Xuxu to directly avoid the cost of upgrading his notebook.

"Your Highness, when will my assessment begin?" Zhao Xuxu humbly asked, even though he felt he should be a guaranteed pass.
But if you give yourself a continuous one or two months of assessment, it will be extremely painful.
Where can he break free now.
It's also his fault for not realizing that the ground under his feet has already been stepped on very solidly.
As a result, he shot up like a rocket.
Don't want anything, just want something, that's Zhao Xu's true portrayal at the moment.
Level 4 spell guardian on the side of divine magic, he can basically pass through without obstacles.
But on the arcane side, after reaching level 5 as a mage and level 3 as a super magic sculptor, he must seek a new advancement.
After considering various options, Zhao Xu decided to choose "Spell Guardian".
After all, among the abilities of the spell guardian, there are two that are too good to pass up.
If Zhao Xu cannot immediately consolidate this level of advancement, he will have to do something funny like using energy absorption technique to lower himself by 1 level back to level 8.
"The assessment is linked to your time at Mister Labor. For someone like you who hasn't stayed for even two months in half a year, don't bother thinking about it, it's definitely the most difficult level." Siservina looked at Zhao Xu with a smile that wasn't a smile.
It turns out it's not that you've already passed.
Zhao Xu sighed inwardly.
But when he turned around, he noticed that Zheng Xinyun beside him was also trying to suppress a smile, looking like she was clearly watching a good show.
Zhao Xu almost wanted to knock on her head and say something sarcastic.
"Goddess, let's get on with it," Zhao Xu said.
It seems that being personally assessed by the founder is not necessarily a good thing.
In any case, after the advancement is successful, everyone's professional abilities are the same, and there will be no discount because of this.
If someone like Lei An, a mage close to being a legend, were to assess him, it's possible that they would become good friends and he would pass the assessment by entertaining him at a pleasure establishment.
At the same time, Zhao Xu also noticed the increasingly dense crowd of people kneeling around the Fallen Star Lake.
Here is the translation:

"If we continue to delay, it may lead to disaster.

As the goddess descends with her aura, these devout believers have basically received enlightenment without even lifting their heads. If someone were to forcefully pull them up, it would only lead to grudges.

Believers can only demonstrate their devotion to the goddess by kneeling humbly.

"What's that?" Xisilvina said with a hint of hesitation.

"Capturing five different demonic beings?"

"...?" Zhao Xu detected a sense of unease.

"Repairing the boundary of Arthur's territory, or else the life energy will flow towards nothingness, causing Arthur to become inferior and perish?"

Is this referring to the ancient lake spirits?

"Or, escaping from the pursuit of a weak, awakened divine power's demonic catcher?"

"Cough cough." Zhao Xu couldn't help but cough twice, "Your Highness, please give me a legendary scope of assessment."

"Alright, recently a forest was destroyed by a mysterious plague, find the mastermind behind it and stop it from spreading."

"Or it's the soul of a kind queen being pulled towards the depths, go and retrieve it."

"There's also one, stopping a malevolent organization from dumping mind-controlling medication into the town's water source."

The ones after that may have decreased in difficulty, but the problems are still challenging and may last for a long time.

"Or, traversing time and space to meet someone from my past."

"I choose this."

The familiar feeling came, and Zhao Xu made a swift decision.

"Very well, you've passed." Goddess Xisilvina said.

At the same time, she lightly tapped her finger."
In an instant, the scenery around Zhao Xu and Zheng Xinyun's boat began to change, from blurry to clear.
"Welcome to my kingdom,"
