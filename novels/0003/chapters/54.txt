Chapter 55: Registration

Arthas's weapons are categorized into three types: basic, military, and special. To fully utilize the power of these weapons, one must reach a state of "expertise". Ordinary people can achieve this state through prolonged training, but at the cost of sacrificing their "specialization". This is also what makes specialization precious.

Unless one's profession inherently possesses this ability, it can be compensated by leveling up the profession, without sacrificing specialization.

Zhao Xu's warrior profession has the basic abilities of "expertise in basic weapons" and "expertise in military weapons". Therefore, this time, it was relatively easy for him to activate his abilities as a monk, including "expertise in basic weapons" and "expertise in light armor".

As for ordinary civilians who are not yet 1st-level adventurers, they do not receive such spiritual compensation.

Next to Zhao Xu, Le'an finally couldn't help but approach him, scrutinizing him carefully.

"Do you mean you've become an expert in using those basic weapons?"

"It's obvious you haven't received any related training beforehand. You wouldn't even know what basic weapons are. Not to mention, God's blessing has never heard of someone improving their weapon proficiency."

Zhao Xu looked at Le'an with a natural expression, as if he didn't need to explain anything. The goddess was his greatest shield at this moment.

Le'an's thoughts only led him to extend his imagination to the goddess's potential applications.

Zhao Xu just wanted to level up as quickly as possible. With someone like Le'an, who was like a half-self, he didn't bother to pretend too much.

"Alright, it's said that some divine children can indeed possess various special abilities, born with that kind of knowledge." Lián ān paused for a moment and then consoled himself, taking Zhao Xǔ to another place.

The shorter Zhao Xǔ stayed here, the less attention he received, which was in line with the will of the association.

It wouldn't be like this unless Lián ān, a liaison officer, was so closely following Zhao Xǔ.

"Lián ān, are we not returning to the floating city?" Zhao Xǔ looked at Lián ān, still being led by him in the church, and couldn't help but ask in a loud voice.

"You little one, do you want to become a wandering pastor?" Lián ān glanced at Zhao Xǔ with a bad mood.

"Nomadic?" Zhao Xǔ suddenly didn't react.

"Although you players from Earth don't need to be so formal, waiting for a batch of people to ascend and receive a title. However, it's basically necessary to register, otherwise, even if you go to another goddess's church in the future, you'll rely on your own pastor level?"

Lián ān said this, and Zhao Xǔ reacted.

Pastors also need to be registered.

Once he gets this registration, he can gradually ascend in his religious affairs.

If he likes adventure, he'll find that all pastors and goddess followers will see him struggling and help him out.

This is the implicit deterrent power of pastors compared to mages.

Not long after, Zhao Xǔ and Lián ān arrived at a hidden church cottage that was far from the surrounding buildings.

"This is the storage place for the personnel records of the goddess church," Lián ān explained briefly.

"So small?" Zhao Xǔ exclaimed, surprised that this small room couldn't hold many documents?

"This is the church of the magic goddess; you don't need to worry about such small things." Lián ān didn't bother to explain.

"Some daily affairs of pastors are indeed recorded and handled in the administrative office, aren't they?"

Zhao Xǔ continued to ask, wondering if everything was done in this way, the place would be congested.
Here is the translation:

"It's not been a few days since a batch of new priests were promoted, and there are many people talking. If someone recognizes you as having just arrived yesterday, it will cause trouble. The priest has not appeared for many years, and the Pope has not seen him since he was ordained."

However, Le An did not reveal that the Pope had known about his existence even before Zhao Xu arrived.

"The registration records at the Affairs Department are all sent here to be archived. I'll let you register here directly, so that it won't be spread out."

As a liaison official, Le An's level is high enough, and the association chairman has not instructed him. He is the association's full-time responsible person for the Goddess Church.

Zhao Xu could only mutter to himself, "If this were the Justice God Church, Le An would have to bring me to the Affairs Department in an orderly manner."

Le An's face was finally familiar with the entire church, and he exchanged a few words with the guards at the entrance. They were then allowed to enter.

After passing through a corridor, they entered a living door and Zhao Xu was suddenly at a loss.

The entire small room was a space almost as large as a basketball court, with countless document cabinets stacked to the ceiling.

People were continuously sitting on flying couches, storing documents, and the clergy on the ground floor were busy pushing documents.

"Don't look around, there are other routes here, this is a specially modified space," Le An reminded Zhao Xu.

Too much curiosity would attract attention from others.

Le An directly led Zhao Xu to a desk, where several clerics in ritual robes were busy with their work.

He then gave a few instructions to the leader and indicated for Zhao Xu to come over.

After receiving the instructions from the head, a young-looking female clerk came over to register Zhao Xu.

Throughout the process, Le An was constantly talking, instructing the woman to fill out the form according to his instructions.

Zhao Xu, the person involved, said not a single word.
Here is the translation of the text:

The supervisor didn't say a word as she watched, and the female clerk could only harden her heart and record it.

The entire process was very simple, and even some verification and data verification were skipped.

It wasn't until the end that the female clerk realized she hadn't obtained much information from the male in front of her.

"Alright, I'll take the remaining ritual tools and give them to you. There's no need to take the saint's seal again, just use the one we had before." Li An nodded in satisfaction.

As Li An and the two prepared to leave, the female clerk also organized the documents in her hand and prepared to hand them over to the next process.

"A miracle, I've never seen a player like this before," she muttered to herself.

When she heard this ordinary-sounding voice, Zhao Xu was taken aback and looked at her in surprise. He didn't expect to meet a player in this heavily guarded place.

Can't emotions exploit players? Exploit them to the point where they have to work part-time in the game?

As Zhao Xu's gaze met the female clerk's, she looked up and was suddenly enlightened, exclaiming, "Oh, you're a player too? How come I've never seen you in the church?"

"Let's go," Li An urged Zhao Xu to leave.

...

"Hey, do you know that today I saw a player who has been promoted to a pastor in the record?" the girl exclaimed.

The girl looked up in surprise, "Pepa, no, aren't those who entered the 300-person list still a few days away?"

"Not at all," said the female clerk, whose name was Pepa. "As a player in the Goddess Church, I know everyone, so I'm curious. The entire process was with another mage, and that guy didn't say a word."
Here is the translation of the text:

Xiǎo kě suddenly lowered his head, and a thought flashed in his mind about a person who had come and gone in a hurry without leaving a trace.

He remembered the words of that man, and it was hard to believe he said, "He's a 1st-level priest?"

"That's definitely true," he said, "it's all because the superior gave me the task to fill it out, who would dare to lie about something like this?"

Xiǎo kě could only bring a shocked expression and slowly describe the appearance of a man.

After finishing, he looked at Pé Pé, who kept nodding and said urgently, "Do you know where he is?"

"Let's go, this is clearly the route of adventure."

"Good grief, he taught me how to understand the domain during the day, and yet he has such a big secret and eats it all by himself."

...

That night, Zhao Xu went offline early and officially became a 1st-level priest, and it can be said that his progress was not behind the current top players.

He believed that he would definitely level up faster than other players.

"Xu, come and take a look, there's a hot post on the forum, and today's top one!" Zhang Qi looked at Zhao Xu and hurriedly urged him.

Zhao Xu quickly got out of bed and walked to Zhang Qi's side, looking over his head, and his expression suddenly became stiff.

"Surprise! A priest training player who completed the task in one day! He has brushed all the career records online!!"
