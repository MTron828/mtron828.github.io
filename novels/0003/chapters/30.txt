Chapter 31: Against the Tide

As Zhao Xu heard Anzheni's tone, he slowly reacted, realizing that everything that had just happened might not have been as simple as he thought.

He hastily recounted the scenes he had witnessed, from the transformation into a female mage to the demon's charm, and finally, how he had firmly recited the incantation.

"Wow!"

Zhao Xu was interrupted by Anzheni's stifled laughter.

"Let me remind you of one thing: whatever you say today, you'd better not tell anyone else about it. Otherwise, you'll be remembered as a legendary mage with a dark history, hahaha...".

Anzheni's smile grew wider, and she could no longer contain her laughter.

"Hey, self-respect is a player's right, isn't it?" Zhao Xu retorted.

"The first point is that there is no magical position, and reciting incantations has no effect. If you ever encounter a demon, you'd better run away rather than sitting there reciting useless incantations."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, realizing that the incantations he had recited were just his own emotional response.

"However, you didn't acquire any information about demons in the past few days, and your instinct to avoid being kissed by a demon is quite keen."

Zhao Xu could only take this as a compliment and try to salvage some face.

"However, don't you think the place you saw had a giant wheel-like disk on the ceiling, like some kind of mechanical clock?"

As Anzheni asked her question, Zhao Xu suddenly became lost in thought, with his full attention drawn to the female mage. Under the intense impact of their first meeting, Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed, and his pupils constricted.
Here is the translation:

"It's not wrong, it's not a transparent screen, but a circular plate, with a scale pattern like a clock on the outside, and I can't remember the rest."

Annie heard this and almost scratched her forehead.

She waved her hand and struck a pose, muttering incantations with her mouth.

Zhao's eyes widened, staring straight at her.

This was the first time Annie had openly used magic in front of him.

Last time, she had cast the "Wish spell," a nine-level spell, without making a sound, and he hadn't noticed.
Now, she was casting magic with such intensity that it couldn't be a legend-level spell?

Zhao's heart counted silently for more than six seconds before a mysterious ball of light burst out from the tip of Annie's finger.

The ball of light gently fell to the ground, turning into dust.

The ground where they stood seemed to shatter into fragments, and Zhao's heart skipped a beat. He thought to himself, "I won't fall from a great height, I won't fall from a great height."

However, flying magic was a three-level spell that he couldn't master.
Moreover, Annie was currently maintaining the spell with a seal, completely unaware of his thoughts.

But after a moment, Zhao realized he was still standing in the same place, as if held by an invisible glass.

The ground continued to evolve, cracking open and then merging back together, even affecting the surrounding space.

After half a month of exposure, Zhao had finally reacted, realizing that this was Annie's illusion magic.

It wasn't that she had directly shattered the land.
The illusion was taking shape slowly and rapidly evolving.

Zhao's mouth opened, and in front of him, he saw the endless rows of books stretching up to the sky, layer upon layer of overlapping bookshelves, and staircases leading up to higher levels.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

There's also the giant wheel on top, and this time, Zhao Xu finally understands that this is the 27th main map of the Arthurian world. From the hero domain of Joseph's Garden to the gray wilderness of Hades, and from the deep abyss of the stormy void to the empty tunnel, they are all situated on top of it. It indicates how this world operates.

Suddenly, like a dream shattered, the fake curtain surrounding them no longer holds together, and one point after another begins to tear apart. Like a vast dust storm, it is washed away by a sudden torrential rain.

The illusions have stopped, and Anzhiya stands at her original position as a young mage, looking at him. Zhao Xu has also understood that what just happened is not a test for him.

That young woman is not a fake spirit either. Zhao Xu's expression reveals a deep sense of solemnity.

"Five-level magic, Mirage City, it seems that the restoration effect is quite good, and it matches what you saw just now," Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.

"That lady is?" Zhao Xu's tone became slightly more polite.

He had been worried that a sudden divine lightning might strike.

"Legendary Mage Sylvaina, Lady." Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise.

He had truly expected this.

Sylvaina, goddess of magic and knowledge.

However, at this moment, her title was still that of a legendary mage. Wasn't it said that the three-in-one was the ultimate form?

"That throne is the throne of the King of the Ancient Magic Empire, which has been crafted with countless resources. You see that seat is only a part of it, and over 80% of its volume is buried beneath it, which is also the core of the binding spell."
Here is the translation:

"So, what you see as those silver on the board is just the outermost material that's worth the least. A suitable person to become a mage will activate their own arcane circuit by sitting down, and condense a magical site as a result."

"However, those with special talents will exhibit extraordinary powers when they sit down. We will arrange our future research and progress direction based on this."

Ansitina paused and gazed deeply at Zhao Xu, trying to read something from his face.

"You have potential, so you'll be different from ordinary people."

"I also have potential, and when I sit down, all the mages present will automatically recover one magical site, including the apprentices."

"As for me today, I want you to experience the same thing, so that all the mages-in-training this term will submit to you and become your future disciples."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, unable to comprehend the reason.

Even Ansitina was surprised by this, and he couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

"Just remember, when you sit down, what happens?"

"What?"

"You disappear."

Zhao Xu was stunned for a moment before pinching himself and regaining his composure.

"Do you mean I'm gone? But I didn't feel any sense of transmission."

"It's not transmission; you've crossed the river of time. You went back to the era before the Third Generation of Sisylvia became a goddess, in the reality temple of the final scroll. You saw her there."

"She walked towards you, naturally curious about someone who had traveled back in time, not some kind of demon trying to kiss you. You'd better forget this thought, or you'll never become a 1st-level priest."

"So I'm curious, what's the biggest characteristic of yours that's not even your potential? What's your greatest trait?"

Note: I've translated the dialogue as accurately as possible, but please note that the original text may contain nuances and subtleties that may not be fully conveyed in translation.
The text translates to:

"Anniya's words were filled with smiling intentions as she looked at him. Zhao Xu's face was tranquil, looking back at her. The reason was very simple, because he was a reborn person."

Note: "重生者" (zhong sheng zhe) refers to a reborn or reincarnated person in Chinese mythology and fiction.
