Chapter 36: Eternal Life?

If players hear that Zhao Xu has obtained the blessings of the prayer technique, they would definitely protest. They won't care about the qualifications Zhao Xu obtained this blessing. In reality, the TC family has no influence on Arthur's abilities.

This is well-known to the public, even the test account's origin is unclear to the high-level officials. Currently, Arthur is still maintaining balance between players, with no players obtaining extremely unbalanced items.

The main reason is that Arthur's elders, the big bosses, don't really care about the players.

Moreover, Arthur's magical items are all mass-produced. The only exception is the divine artifacts, which the big bosses don't have any left.

In the past, from the previous era to 10 years later, there has never been a player from Earth who obtained a divine artifact.

Magic is indeed terrifying, but magic will also reason with you within its own range.

It's just that divine artifacts don't reason with you.

When Zhao Xu heard An Ti Noya's proposal, his first thought was that he should just give her 25,000 GP and then he could use that money to run his business in Arthur.

In the past, there have been players who did this business, mainly due to the initial capital constraints that troubled most people, players were all poor.

25,000 GP is actually half of the price of the intelligence headband that increases intelligence by +6, which is 36,000 GP.

The +4 intelligence headband only costs 16,000 GP, leaving some extra, and can also be exchanged for two more +2 attribute equipment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Currently, Anzhi Noya's proposal to him is to add +1 intelligence, which is far more superior to +4 and +6. However, it's not that simple. The same-name effect does not stack, and if Zhao Xu wears a +6 intelligence headgear in the future, even if he finds a +6 intelligence necklace, it won't work. The equipment provides additive bonuses, with the highest effect. However, the "+1" intelligence bonus provided by the prayer spell can be stacked, as it is an internal bonus.

To obtain internal bonuses, one needs to have corresponding growth attribute books, such as "Clear Mind" and "Prayer Spell". However, the cost is eternal life. Arthur's 9th-level spell, which is famous and well-known, has been rumored about by players, but Zhao Xu has never heard of the "Ageless" 9th-level spell.

This shows that it is a secret that is not transmitted, and even if one tries to copy it, there is no place to copy from. Perhaps this time he has missed his chance, and in the future, he will just have to wait until he dies at the age of 70 or 80.

Anzhi Noya may not give him another chance. It's not easy to make a choice when there are 6 attributes and 36 9th-level prayer spells that need to be fulfilled to achieve eternal life.

After the crossing, this event becomes a true and real story.

Even the immortal elves will eventually have to see the Elf God at the age of 800. After the crossing, Zhao Xu hid in the Floating City, pretending to study magic, and may just stay there until the Floating City is destroyed.

Zhao Xu lowered his head, thinking about the benefits and losses.

Eternal life.

1 point of intelligence.

Others may not be troubled by this choice, but Zhao Xu is deeply puzzled.

Slowly, in Anzhi Noya's eyes, Zhao Xu's eyes gradually became brighter.

As the fish swims all his life, he is just a fish.
Here is the translation of the text:

He would rather burn out in an instant of glory.
Zhao Xu chose the second option---"
Just as he was about to finish this, Zhao Xu suddenly stopped and asked with a somewhat awkward expression: "Teacher, if I were to read 'The Book of Clarity of Thought' or receive the effect of the prayer again in the future, can I stack them?"

Anastya Noria wasn't unaware, but some things Zhao Xu didn't say, and she wouldn't supplement them.

This key, Zhao Xu had to ask clearly.

"All won't work," Anastya Noria directly rejected.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu almost felt like he had lost half his vitality.

Unless he was content with having only 1 point of internal value for the rest of his life, he would have to start over again.

The 1 point of intelligence he had obtained with eternal life would be rendered useless.

"Internal attribute value enhancement requires continuous casting of prayer, that is, five consecutive prayers, otherwise, there would be countless adventurers with 36 points of internal value wandering the streets."

Anastya Noria couldn't help but say this.

Zhao Xu's determination, which had taken him a lot of effort to make up his mind, was suddenly crushed halfway.

It was too late now, and he could only do this.

He continued to look at Anastya Noria: "The second option."

Anastya Noria raised an eyebrow and looked at Zhao Xu, saying, "It's easy to learn the 'Sihou' technique, but the number of people who can receive the technique is limited. We need to go through approval and review to apply it to someone."

"So, if you miss this opportunity this time, there's no guarantee you'll get another chance in the future, otherwise, the old man you saw today wouldn't have aged to this extent."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The greed for power brought about by aging increases mental abilities, so he should accept this technique once he's done enjoying it, but unfortunately, he doesn't have the qualification for it."

"So, you won't regret it?"

Zhou Xu shook his head.

He needs to quickly enhance his abilities and strive to achieve this within a year of crossing over.

If he were a local native of Arthur, he would naturally choose to live forever and slowly improve his abilities.

But he isn't.

And besides, Zhou Xu also has confidence that he can definitely earn the opportunity for eternal life after becoming stronger.

After a while, Zhou Xu thought for a moment and said, "To die with honor, rather than to live with shame."

He knew that these magicians all had many constant spells, including "Cunning Speech", which could allow them to understand the languages of other beings and facilitate communication.

Annie Noja definitely translated what he said, but the meaning got through.

Living boldly or dying bravely.

But Zhou Xu's intention was actually to strengthen himself and protect his family, and as for achieving some extraordinary accomplishments, he would deal with it later.

If he equips himself with various triggering, defensive, reviving, teleporting, and immunizing spells, he definitely won't go on adventures.

But he needs to tell Annie Noja that he's not a loser, he has a strong desire to rise to the top.

"What are you waiting for then?" Annie Noja said with a completely uninterested tone.

Hearing this, Zhou Xu felt awkward and almost punched himself in the thigh, muttering to himself, "I'm not mistaken about the emotions, I'm mistaken about the person."
Here is the translation:

Ansenia, this legendary mage, even without leveling up her "read people" skill, won't hinder her from casually using a spell to raise the skill level to a point where she can see through someone's true intentions at a glance.

It seems that dealing with these high-level mages like Arthur in the future will require being straightforward and honest, without trying to play tricks.

Just as Zhao Xu had made up his mind not to play along anymore, he saw Ansenia lift her hand, pointing straight at him.

There was no incantation, no magical stance.

It was the same as last time, with a flash of spiritual energy passing through.

The sky and earth remained serene and peaceful.

However, Zhao Xu saw the attribute of her character card.

[Intelligence: 17 (+3) = 16 (natural) + 1 (inherent)]

She really had gained a bit of intelligence.

"And, by the way, the approval for the eternal name is fake. I'll teach you this spell when you reach level 17, and you can cast it on anyone you want."

Oh my god, who said that female mages can't deceive people?
