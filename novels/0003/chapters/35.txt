Chapter 36: Eternal Life?

If players heard that Zhao Xu was able to enjoy the benefits of prayer magic, they would definitely stand out to protest. They wouldn't care about why Zhao Xu obtained this benefit. In fact, TC family has no influence on Arthur's abilities. This has been widely known since ancient times, and even the creators of the test account couldn't explain the source of Arthur's abilities. Currently, Arthur is still maintaining balance for players, and no player has obtained an item that disrupts balance. The main reason is that Arthur's nobles don't really care about players. Moreover, Arthur's magical items can be mass-produced, and only the nobles don't have any excess supplies. In the past until 10 years ago, no Earth player had obtained a divine item.

Magic is indeed frightening, but magic also has its limits. It can only reason within its own range. It can be pierced, but it can also be immune. Except for divine items, it can't reason.

Zhao Xu thought to himself after hearing Anni's proposal: why not just give him 25,000 GP and let him take care of Arthur? In the past, there were players who did this business, mainly due to the initial capital constraints, which made most people poor. 25,000 GP is actually equivalent to half the price of the +6 intelligence helmet - 36,000 GP. The +4 intelligence helmet is only 16,000 GP, leaving a surplus, and can also exchange for multiple +2 attribute equipment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Currently, Anzheniya's proposal of +1 intelligence is far beyond +4 and +6. However, it's not as simple as just adding numbers. Same-name items do not stack, and even if Zhao Xu finds a +6 intelligence headband, it won't work. Equipment provides only enhanced values, with the highest effective value. However, the "+1" intelligence boost provided by the prayer spell can stack because it is an internal value. To obtain internal values, one needs to have corresponding growth attribute books, such as "Clear Mind" and "Prayer".

But the price is eternal life? Arthur's Level 9 Spell, because of its great name, players may never have heard of it, but as soon as they do, they'll talk about it. However, Zhao Xu has never heard of the "Indelible Time" Level 9 Spell that grants eternal life. It seems that this is a secret that has never been passed down, and even if someone wants to copy it, there's no place to copy from.

Perhaps this time, Zhao Xu will miss his chance. Anzheniya might not give him another opportunity. Really, it's not that easy to talk about, considering the six attributes and 36 Level 9 Prayer Spells needed to fulfill the requirements.

After everyone crosses over, this event will become the truth. Even long-lived elves, who live for about 800 years, will eventually meet their gods. After crossing over, Zhao Xu hid in the Floating City, pretending to be researching spells, and might just stay there until the city is destroyed.

Zhao Xu lowered his head, thinking about the benefits and losses. Eternal life. 1 point of intelligence. While others wouldn't hesitate, Zhao Xu is trapped in deep contemplation.

Slowly, in Anzheniya's playful eyes, Zhao Xu's eyes gradually brightened. As a fish, he will be a fish for a lifetime.
Here is the translation of the text:

He'd rather blaze in that instant of glory.
Zhao Xu said, "I'll take the second option—"
Just as he was about to finish this, Zhao Xu suddenly stopped and asked with a hint of awkwardness, "Teacher, if I were to read 'The Book of Clarity of Mind' or receive the effects of the prayer again in the future, can I stack them?"

Anny Noir didn't know, but Zhao Xu didn't say it, so she wouldn't supplement it.
This key point, Zhao Xu still had to ask clearly.
"It won't work," Anny Noir directly rejected it.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu almost felt like he'd lost half his soul.
Unless he was content with only gaining one point of internal value in his lifetime, he would have to start over again.
The one point of intelligence he had gained through eternal life was worthless.
"Internal attribute enhancement requires consecutive use of prayer, that is, five consecutive prayers, otherwise, there would be countless adventurers with 36 internal value buffs on the streets," Anny Noir said without hesitation.

Zhao Xu's determination, which had been hard-won, was suddenly crushed in half.

Now that it's come to this, there's nothing to do but continue.

He looked at Anny Noir again, "The second option."
Anny Noir raised an eyebrow and looked at Zhao Xu, saying, "It's easy to learn the 'No Trace of Time' technique, but the number of recipients is limited, and we need to apply for permission and approval before casting it on someone."
"So, if you miss this opportunity this time, you may not have another chance in the future, and even the old man you saw today, Marcal, won't be as old as this."
Here is the translation of the text:

"True greed, brought about by the aging process, adds value to one's intelligence. He should accept this technique once he's finished enjoying it. However, he doesn't have the qualifications for it."

"So, you won't regret it?"

Zhao Xu shook his head.

He needs to quickly enhance his abilities and strive to do so within the year of his reincarnation.

If he were a native of this land, he would naturally choose to live forever, gradually improving his abilities.

However, he is not.

Moreover, Zhao Xu has confidence that he can, in the future, become strong enough to negotiate for the opportunity to live forever for himself.

After a while, Zhao Xu thought for a moment before saying:

"Rather die with honor, than live in shame."

He knew that these wizards all possessed many fixed spells, including the "Art of Deception", which could allow them to understand and communicate with other beings.

Anny pointedly translated his words, but the meaning was conveyed.

Living a vibrant life or dying a glorious death.

However, Zhao Xu's true intention was to strengthen himself and protect his family, and he would worry about achieving great achievements later.

If he had put on various activating, defensive, reviving, teleporting, and immunizing spells, he would definitely not venture out.

But he needed to tell Anny that he was not a mediocre person and had an upward striving desire.

What kind of extraordinary ability would he be given?

"That's it, then. Good luck," Anny said with a completely unmoved expression.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, and he almost wanted to slap his thigh in frustration. He cursed himself silently, thinking that he had mistaken his emotions for someone else.
Here is the translation:

Anenonia, the legendary mage, could even use a skill like "察言观色" without leveling it up at all, but that wouldn't hinder her from casually upgrading the skill to a high level with a spell.
High enough to see through someone's true intentions at a glance.
It seems that in the future, dealing with these high-level mages like Arthur, I'll have to be honest and straightforward, without trying to deceive them.
Just as Zhao Xu had made up his mind not to play tricks anymore, he saw Anenonia lift her hand, pointing straight at him.
No incantation, no magical stance.
It was the same as last time, a flash of spiritual energy.
The sky and earth were still serene and gentle.
But Zhao Xu saw her character card's attributes.
【Intelligence: 17 (+3) = 16 (natural) + 1 (inherent)】
She really had gained some intelligence.
"And by the way, you were deceived about the eternal name approval. I'll teach you this spell when I'm level 17, and you can cast it on whoever you want."
Damn it, who said a female mage couldn't deceive people.
