Chapter 38: The First Battle

The next day, Zhao Xun logged back into the game as Arthur, feeling refreshed and energized. It had been two weeks since he'd slept for eight hours straight, and he finally felt rested. As a mage, it was crucial to get at least eight hours of sleep, regardless of whether it was shallow or deep sleep. Many players had complained about this in the past.

Zhao Xun had logged off at the Apex Tower yesterday and logged back in at the same location. However, if he died, he would be revived at the nearest temple to the last city he'd visited. In the past, some players had gotten lost in the wilderness and couldn't find their way back, forcing them to pay a dear price to revive.

After learning the value of revival stones, players had begun to prioritize skills like "survival" and mapping.

As Zhao Xun logged in, Anzhen Niya was already standing there, looking at him and saying, "Sit down and start preparing your spells."

Zhao Xun followed her instructions, sitting down and assuming a meditative posture, as if contemplating the intricacies of spellcasting. He had already pre-studied the spells the day before.

Although Anzhen Niya pointed out a few things about his state, Zhao Xun was confident in his abilities. As a mage, he didn't need to frantically flip through spellbooks like some players did. Instead, he could rely on his internalized spell models to guide him.

At present, he was in the process of pre-casting his spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This hour, I've prepared my spells. Next, I'll use which spell? As long as I consume the corresponding 'swift', 'standard', 'full circle', or even more time to cast the spell, it's fine. Most of Arther's spells are 'standard' time-based.

Only a few spells are naturally 'swift' time-based. For example, spells like 'Feather Falling' that can be released with just a thought will be compressed into 'swift' time.

In actual combat, 'full circle' spells are too long and easy to target, so wizards usually don't use them. If you release a 'swift' time spell and then another 'standard' time spell, the latter will be delayed to almost a full circle.

So, generally, in a low-level wizard's battle, it's common to take turns casting spells.

After a few hours, Zhao Xu finally found that his spell slots were all ready.

He woke up and found that these spell slots were on his character card.

All he needed to do was spend an hour filling in the blank spell slots with specific spells.

Fortunately, he had three extra spell slots available for 'Precognition', so he didn't need to prepare.

At this moment, Zhao Xu stood up directly and looked at Anniya, saying, "Teacher, I'm ready."
Anniya looked at him and said, "Are you sure?"
Zhao Xu nodded.

This time, Anniya flashed directly in front of him, grabbed his hand, and teleported him away again.

"You're about to be teleported. Do you agree?"
This time, Zhao Xu finally saw the dynamic panel at the bottom of his character card, which appeared in his mind."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

This is also a privilege of being a 1st-class professional for them.

The entire world has become informationized towards them.

However, after he completed the ritual yesterday, he only asked if he agreed to the action the other side was about to take, and he didn't say it was transmission.

Because this panel is the source of information, and he thinks it's transmission, so it will be displayed as transmission.

He can't use this information panel as evidence.

Zhao Xu also didn't make a choice, and everything was decided according to the consistent behavior of yesterday - he defaulted to agreeing.

Zhao Xu suddenly transported from the pinnacle tower to a vast and confined area.

The surroundings were empty and desolate, with a high wall stretching all the way to the periphery, like a gigantic prison.

Torches that never went out were inserted all around, illuminating him and Anniya, making it impossible to hide even their shadows.

"This is the original arena where mages usually perform magical duels," Anniya said.

"Your task is to eliminate the summoned creatures that will appear next."

"Don't worry about psychological pressure; it's just a projection. However, if you can't bring yourself to do it, I suggest you just go back to doing research."

Zhao Xu didn't pay any attention to Anniya's words, having slaughtered more goblins than Anniya had ever seen.

Blood was also relatively sensitive for the first time.

Suddenly, Anniya pointed at something - "Level 1 Undead Summoning".

A middle-sized human skeleton warrior appeared directly in front of Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire body emitted an aura of evil, with a large iron shield directly covering the front, blocking the main assault. The other hand was wielding a curved sword, and the hollow-eyed sockets were focused intently on Zhao Xü.

Zhao Xü gazed at the skeletal warrior in front of him and suddenly felt his heart calm down.

He had participated in battles against the undead army in his previous life.

As a civilian, fighting a skeleton was quite challenging, but as a first-class warrior, it was not a problem at all.

At the moment Zhao Xü judged, the mindless skeletal warrior directly followed An Ti Nia's orders and charged towards him as an enemy.

Zhao Xü took a deep breath.

He repeatedly recalled the data of the opponent in his mind.

The medium-sized skeleton had a life value of 1D12, which meant its life value ranged from 1 to 12 (with an average of 6 HP).

Its attack power was only 1 level, and it had a 5/6 chance of evading attacks. However, its defense level was 15 levels, almost 5 levels higher than the natural defense of 10 points, making it a challenging opponent for Zhao Xü, who was currently unarmed.

The advantage was that Zhao Xü had expertise in the "First Strike" skill, allowing him to strike the enemy first and often hit before the enemy could react.

Just as he was considering this, the skeleton had closed in on him.

It was uncertain whether he could complete his spellcasting before the skeleton attacked him.

Zhao Xü had to decide which first-level spell to release.

This was a test set by An Ti Nia, and his choice would determine his score.

Should he choose "Protect Evil", "Rainbow Spraying", "Magic Missile", "Mage's Armor", "Weakening Ray", or "Shape Shift"?

Six first-level spells surged through his mind.

But which one to choose?

The "Magic Missile" could release a single force missile, causing 1D4+1 (2-5 points) of damage, but it was uncertain whether it would be fatal.

"Protect Evil" was perfectly suited to counter the skeleton's evil array, but it was only treating the symptoms, not the root cause.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mage's shield armor is boosted by 4 points of shield defense, ensuring that the skeleton's hit rate decreases to 40%?
Finally, Zhao Xu gritted his teeth and directly chanted the incantation.
A concentrated energy projectile burst forth from his hand."
