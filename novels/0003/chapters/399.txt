Chapter 400: The Black Market

Zhao Xu didn't directly head to the Wizards' Association in the town, but instead relied on his memory to go to a nearby magic material store first.

"Why is it called the Black Market?" Vivia was still having trouble understanding.

"It's because it can't be displayed in the sunlight. The sources of those magical items are not very clear."

"Stealing? Deception?" As a Saint Warrior, Vivia felt a sense of discomfort when she heard such behavior.

"There are both, but more are dug up from beneath the earth," Zhao Xu said vaguely, looking at Vivia with a hint of mischief.

Vivia suddenly stopped in her tracks.

She turned around, looking around at the surroundings like Zhao Xu, her eyes like autumn water on her mask.

"Robbing tombs and ruins?"

As she spoke, Vivia nodded to herself, "The Northern Alliance is close to the Ice Mountain Range, and I'm sure there was a magic alliance that lasted over five hundred years. However, it was destroyed during the Great Calamity period. It's true that treasures can be dug up from beneath the earth."

Zhao Xu didn't expect Vivia to have a good grasp of geography and history.

He also relied on his own knowledge of the region and history to guess and connect the information, leading him to conclude the main reason for the Black Market's existence.

As a demon, it's rare for someone to have expertise in multiple skills, let alone reaching the level of over ten ranks. It's even more unusual for someone like Zhao Xu to have mastered almost all knowledge.
Here is the translation of the text:

With his intelligence reaching 28 points, he can get at least 9 skill points from intelligence, which can cover both knowledge and skill upgrades.

"Let's go."

Zhao Xu had already walked up to the entrance of a materials store with a clock on the door. The store looked worn out and hadn't been renovated in years.

"This kind of store won't have magical items," Viola seemed unsure.

"This kind of shop is definitely worth tens of thousands of gold coins, and they won't sell it here," Zhao Xu smiled.

"We have to go in first and prove that we're customers, then they'll take us to those underground residences."

"That clock on the door means this store is the entrance?" Viola seemed confused.

"No, it means the opponent is selling antique art. These things are often mixed with magical items that can last for many eras, and they're basically from the same channel."

"Antique?"

As an immortal being, Viola found it difficult to understand the concept of "antique". For them, even a stone coin could be stored for thousands of years without any issues.

Moreover, demons might have interacted with a family for seven or eight generations and even collected the souls of each generation.

"Antique can be understood as old art. As for your stone brooms that have been used for thousands of years without getting old, that's just old inventory, not the same thing," Zhao Xu corrected quickly.

As he spoke, he pushed open the door curtain and walked into the store.

Unlike the small storefront outside, Zhao Xu entered and found a row of glass bottles and jars on the counter that touched the ceiling, filled with various magical materials.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu had many reasons for owning a full set of goods, and most of the materials were not unfamiliar to him. On the other hand, there was a shelf that was stacked with a lot of old and peculiar items, including ancient long swords like those worn by aristocrats, shields with scratches and dents, and various small items like magical tools, accessories, and vases. They looked like a miscellaneous goods shop.

Behind the counter sat an old man wearing a fur hat, his cheeks sunken, and his body leaning against a chair. "What do you want to buy?" he asked.

"Let me take a look at the old stuff," Zhao Xu replied in a cryptic tone.

"How many of those can you get?" the old man asked.

"Break a hundred, no problem," Zhao Xu replied.

The old man's eyes lit up slightly. "Can you choose one item from my shelf?"

At this time, Zhao Xu was not far from the shelf, but he stopped and scanned the items on the shelf repeatedly.

"What do you mean by 'one'?" asked Vivi, who had noticed that Zhao Xu's tone had changed since she entered.

"This is to avoid outsiders interrupting our price negotiation," Zhao Xu explained. "The prices of these items are not fixed and vary depending on the value of the magical items. They can be as high as 10,000 gold coins or as low as one gold coin."

"I just meant one hundred gold coins in my previous sentence," Zhao Xu added.

Vivi nodded this time, and Zhao Xu said that he had broken a hundred, implying that he had brought a budget of over 10,000 gold coins and was setting the direction for the old man.
Here is the translation of the text:

Actually, he can now cast the minute-level spell "Secret Vision" that can emit a radar-like detection magic similar to "Detection Magic", but with a wider range of up to tens of meters. However, the spell cannot be maintained due to its ability to be dispelled.

But when he reaches level 7, the 2nd-level ability "Secret Vision" of the Curse Guardian will be available, so it's not a big problem.

"What does this old man want us to pick something?" Vivian asked curiously.

"It's to prove our abilities. If we buy something from him, it's a guarantee that we'll enter the black market, otherwise, as outsiders, we can't easily enter," Zhao Xu said.

Before becoming the vice president of the Starfall Association, Zhao Xu deliberately came to the black market, fearing that if he delayed it, his actions would be too conspicuous and might be noticed or even blocked.

"So we need to choose something that's not too expensive and won't cause too much loss," Vivian quickly reacted.

"We should choose something genuine," Zhao Xu said.

"If we pick the wrong thing, it means we're completely inexperienced and don't understand the market. Whatever we choose, he'll take it, but he'll take advantage of those who don't know the market and can't tell the difference between genuine and fake products," Zhao Xu said, still having a sense of unease.

He had experienced this kind of loss in his past life.

Luckily, in this life, he wouldn't suffer such a loss unless it was absolutely necessary. Zhao Xu wouldn't do something so foolish.

It's not worth the risk, and he's not willing to take the loss.

Looking at Zhao Xu's intense focus as he carefully examined the values, even Vivian, who didn't have the ability to estimate prices, couldn't help but use her mind-reading: "Why don't you let me negotiate with him instead?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian, born with exceptional charm, is actually just 12 steps ahead in her negotiations. What's truly astonishing is her 19-step deception and intimidation skills.

"Everything follows the rules, and you won't fall into the trap of breaking the rules," said Zhao Xu.

At this moment, Vivian from the "Orderly Good" faction looked at Zhao Xu, who belonged to the "Neutral Good" faction, and it was clear that she was the more orderly one.

Although she had previously been a chaotic evil imp, Zhao Xu hesitated for a moment before pointing to a book on the bottom shelf, saying, "How much is this?"

The old man laughed and took a puff on his cigar, almost choking, before saying, "This is an ancient tome of magic, worth 100 gold coins."

"May I take a look?" Zhao Xu asked.

However, Zhao Xu didn't move a muscle, standing still in front of the bookshelf.

The old man's eyes sparkled with excitement, and he slowly walked towards the book, his pace deliberately slow, as if trying to test the patience of the two of them.

However, Zhao Xu waited patiently until the old man picked up the book and placed it on a velvet-covered redwood box.

Only then did Zhao Xu take the book.

"I'm worried something might happen?" Vivian said, now starting to understand the implications of Zhao Xu's actions.

"That is, if I take it, the entire book might scatter, including the jade stones, and I don't even know the price," Zhao Xu said.

This transaction can be a once-in-a-lifetime deal or a lifetime investment.

In his previous life, Zhao Xu had also helped his friend, Zhang Qi, by using egg whites to deceive people into buying fake goods.

"You humans are too complicated," Vivian commented, unable to help but touch her waist, only to realize that her Holy Avenger and the entire set of secret silver armor had already been put away in the dimension bag.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu flipped through a few pages with patience, his own max-level "Spell Identification" skill, stacked with his 9th-grade intelligence attribute, reaching a total of 18 grades of spell identification, which can be said to be outstanding.

Currently, the player is ranked first.

In an instant, he looked at some unusual places from this random magical tome.

"This book, I can only see up to 70," Zhao Xu immediately gave his own price with expectation.

Without needing to say more, at this point, the "individual" referred to by "his" meant a single gold coin.

"Will you make a deal?" Vi Vi asked, somewhat unable to understand, in their depths, meeting and making a concession was the most basic courtesy.

"In this place, making a concession exceeding half means you think the other party is intentionally killing you, and the next second, you'll be chased away," Zhao Xu said with no good temper.

The prices of magical items and magical tomes in their eyes, professional experts, estimated calculation errors were basically not more than 10%.

"What is this book?" Vi Vi struggled to recognize the mysterious characters on the cover.
