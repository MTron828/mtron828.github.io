Chapter 597: I'm Not a Savage

"Have the casualty statistics been finalized?" asked Zhao Xu, standing atop the tower and gazing out at the vast expanse of land before him.

Next to him, Wang Qingwei was shaking her head, her face stern. "The overall number of wounded is still being tallied, but I'm afraid it's likely to be over 10%."

Wang Qingwei had been working non-stop since yesterday, coordinating the various departments and distributing resources. As the head of the "Granny Department", she had to mediate disputes between the various factions.

Wrinkling her brow, she said, "Although those heavenly beings did cast restorative spells on the people of Yina before they left, it's still not enough. Those with temporary attribute damage can recover with some rest, but those infected with poison or who have suffered permanent attribute loss will need our help."

Zhao Xu nodded, "Let's distribute the magical supplies we've stockpiled first, and I'll do my best to procure the scarce ones."

Mentioned in this passage is the "Treasure Trove" referred to by Anzinoja, which is also time to put on the agenda.

"Then there are the latest developments - on one hand, the gods' temples have increased their efforts, sending more priests to the wilderness to spread the word and even establishing temples."
Here is the translation:

"On the other hand, our entire Shangri-La framework also needs your decision-making. As Wang Congwei said, he handed over a stack of sheepskin papers to Zhao Xu. Zhao Xu took it and looked at it, realizing that Wang Congwei had mobilized nearly 50 million people from the Huaxia region in just two weeks. It's almost as if we've caught up with South Korea, and even surpassed some European countries. According to the latest planning book, which was painstakingly prepared by numerous elites, the current progress of Shangri-La is still inadequate. Zhao Xu didn't have any selfish desires to gather an entire 10 billion people, but even now, we're still short of reaching a quarter of that number. Moreover, Shangri-La is now in a unique position, with the ability to absorb the entire wasteland without any obstacles.

"We were originally discussing the merger of other regions, and the scale is usually not exponential growth. But this unexpected crisis has disrupted our plans. I estimate that each major region will need to take a few days to reorganize. Wang Congwei also nodded in agreement, "Fortunately, this time the Goddess has given us a helping hand, further solidifying your reputation. Initially, those forces not affiliated with Shangri-La could only offer you a simple favor. Now, it's almost like a lifesaving favor, and our future negotiations and intimidation will be much easier. Especially, everyone knows that the Ghost Wave is a periodic disaster that will occur every few years in the wasteland, so more forces will want to join us."

At this time, Wang Qingwei also reveals a hint of difficulty, "The key issue is whether we can rapidly expand the entire team, including the entire management team." 

Conquering the world and governing it are two different things; otherwise, there would be no stories about releasing troops and wine cups.

In non-fundamental professional systems, there are non-combat-oriented professions such as civilians, nobles, and experts.

Even former authority holders can seamlessly enter new management positions, and they can quickly become level 4 or 5 civilians, nobles, or experts.

Some non-player mercenaries have even reached level 2 after this round of battles, and some civilians have also reached level 2. Although they still lack combat power, their vitality has increased, indicating that their overall quality is still improving.

They can also enjoy the benefits of leveling up every three levels, such as gaining a new skill or attribute point.

"This is going to give you a headache,"

Although Zhao Xuyu's "negotiation" skill can be relied upon to construct a high-level spell, he can also get along with each person as smoothly as a spring breeze. However, he is naturally a lone wolf.

He is a perfect embodiment of a nerd who can play with his own interests for a lifetime. If it's not necessary, he won't bother with external communication.

If he has to take on various arbitration management roles, he will naturally be hesitant to face the messy situation at hand.

At this time, the management staff who have been absorbed are still doing well, but in the face of survival crises, most people are basically honest and cooperative.

However, this world will always have its quirks, and there will always be people with character flaws in the talented team.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the old days, China was already a society with a strong sense of morality, and after crossing over, it's even more complicated, with who is related to whom, who is friends with whom, and who is from the same hometown, and so on.

Just look at the first batch of management personnel who have been selected to form the basic framework of the entire organization, and you'll see that many of them are gossiping and spreading rumors behind the scenes.

For two weeks, he barely got to go home a few times, and even people with extraordinary abilities could convey messages to his parents and then pass them on to him.

Some of his relatives even came to ask him, "What's going on? Why did you give all the administrative power to Wang Congwei? Are you planning to marry her off to him?"

Luckily, Zhao Xu has a halo of authority, and when he smiles at Wang Congwei, she will immediately shut up.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu still patiently opens up the latest version of the "organizational structure" in front of him, also known as the "power white paper".

He and Wang Congwei were both students before they crossed over, and even though they are both intelligent now, they still need to respect "experience" and "profession".

So, they adopted the template of the country before they crossed over, with some minor adjustments. However, the departments are greatly simplified, and there are no too many layers.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu looks at the "management team" who have been selected this time, and many of them are well-known figures from before they crossed over, including elites from various industries, who have been incorporated into the entire organization.

Similarly, some powerful players who Zhao Xu had no contact with before have also appeared on the list.

Including some villains who were born with a talent for betrayal, who want to rebel and become independent, but Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't plan to do much, as the organization doesn't tolerate thought crimes.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The entire Yànán, he was planning to raise sheep, adding fuel to the fire from time to time.

He really fell, and then he slapped his buttocks and became a legendary wizard.

"Let's publish this document and let them take office quickly, and start working on the compensation and vocational training for this war, as there are still too few professionals in Yànán."

"The next month's ghost tide, although it won't be as spectacular as this time, we should still be cautious."

King Wei nodded, saying, "Well, several player guilds have sent elite teams to investigate the reason why this ghost tide is so large."

As King Wei spoke, he pointed to the deep and bottomless caves that had been excavated on the plains, from which the undead army emerged, and then multiplied, spreading all over the mountains.

"Yes, I'll go take a look later."

Zhao Xu also felt the convenience of the boss, who didn't need to spend too much thought on it, and roughly understood how the entire system worked. It was no wonder that everyone wanted to be a leader.

The first commander's authority was unmatched, let alone the subsequent financial and personnel powers, which also ensured the smooth operation of the previous ones.

Then Zhao Xu's figure disappeared into the high tower.

Only King Wei was left with a dazed expression, gazing at the location where Zhao Xu's figure had disappeared, with a hint of admiration in her eyes.

However, she wanted to break through the five rings to cast the teleportation spell, which would take some time until the entire Yànán stabilized.

It's undeniable that the title of the construction wizard of the Chinese district is not just empty words.

Zhao Xu, who was rarely idle during the battle's maintenance time in Yànán, saw countless people busy, trying to repair the road and build buildings.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mage players couldn't even cast the "petrification" and "de-petrification" spells, so the entire process relied on manual labor. Fortunately, within two weeks, the carriages were pushed by hand and the process was replicated. As for the nearby area, it was divided into a research facility, where they were trying to verify which technologies on Earth could be replicated.

As for the steam engine, once the steel materials were refined, it would take no more than half a day to replicate it. There were already dozens of design diagrams stacked in the warehouse. And at this moment, Yǎnán was almost fully invested in the large-scale production and construction process, leaving no time for leisure.

Zhāo Xù saw this scene and couldn't help but shake his head. If humans from Earth were to travel to an environment similar to Earth, they would be able to replicate all the technologies from the previous era within half a century.

The numerous technical talents and skilled personnel, combined with the unquantifiable literacy rate, released an industrial power that was truly miraculous. In the previous era, Zhāo Xù was at a lower level and couldn't sense this point, but this time he stood tall, naturally able to clearly understand Yǎnán's true growth.

Suddenly, he noticed a group of people gathered together in a corner, away from the busy crowds. At this moment, a loud voice echoed inside - "From the icy mountain ranges to the tropical rainforests of the south, there are groups of brave warriors who are feared by all. Some people call them crazy warriors, believing they represent destruction, evil, and brutality. However, I can tell you that these people have proved their courage and perseverance to their allies, and their inner strength is unyielding, but they will not tolerate anyone's disrespect."
Here is the translation:

"While I prefer to refer to this group as 'savages', it is also one of the most common occupations of Arthur, and one of the strongest melee occupations as well. At this moment, a robust man stood on a high platform, addressing the students below who were struggling to maintain a plank position. He still wore the wounds left by his recent battle with the undead.

It was clear that this savage warrior had just finished a brutal battle and had rushed back to train the students below. Meanwhile, Arthur had not built many buildings yet, but there were already over 800 people who wanted to become professionals.

Therefore, Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei decided to invite top-ranked players to serve as professional mentors, with no distinction or refusal, and gradually select and teach them. Once students obtained the "student certification", they could receive "student rations" from Arthur, ensuring they had enough food and did not need to work for labor points. They could even support their families.

The mentors, who were actually the "savages", also received rewards such as "gold coins" and "magic items" based on the number of "1st-level professionals" they taught.

At this moment, the savage mentor was making the students below maintain the same training posture, naturally testing their willpower.

"You all started with basic camp tests, at least not belonging to the lawful alignment. Those who are lawful and powerful were sent to the adjacent warrior team by me," the savage mentor shouted loudly.

"Are we savages who don't follow the rules and like to cause trouble?""
Here is the translation of the text:

The workers who were busy repairing roads and building buildings gazed curiously at the barbarians' intense training, and after hearing this self-deprecating joke, they couldn't help but laugh. "I can tell you this, this sentence is neither right nor wrong. Indeed, the wild power is the source of our strength, so we may have abundant creative expression power, but we may also become a source of thoughtless destruction. So, I hope you can, like my mentor said, be wild but not crazy."

As the barbarian finished speaking, he jumped down from the stage, silently walking past the students who were lying on the ground, exhausted, with heavy loads on their backs. Their parents looked on, both joyful and worried, at the sight.

"Before the first lesson, I naturally have to boast about our barbarian skills, so that your sweat today will have some value."

"The first aspect is that our barbarian skills include climbing, craftsmanship, animal husbandry, intimidation, jumping, listening, riding, survival, and swimming. On this scale of skills, barbarians can achieve half the effect with twice the effort, and these skills can be seen as essential survival skills in this wilderness."

"So, to become a barbarian, it's all about excelling in these skills. You don't need to worry about not being able to survive, and you may even get the qualification to go hunting outside soon."

After the barbarian finished speaking, the students' eyes lit up.

The wilderness is both a dead land and a treasure land. In just a few short days, many stories have spread about people who went out to hunt and found treasure, turning their fortunes around. However, the outside world is too treacherous, and without a guaranteed means of survival, going out is equivalent to a death sentence.
Here is the translation:

"Of course, our barbarians' greatest reliance on fame and the most crucial power is the frenzied state that can be obtained at level 1. In this state, we are invincible!"

"And people with the ability to go frenzied all share a common trait, which can be seen at a glance."

Just then, this barbarian directly pointed at Zhao Xu, "For example, that robust gentleman, I can tell he's also a barbarian."

"What?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at the lively scene in front of him with a dazed expression.

He couldn't help but glance at the permanent magic on his body.

This cursed mage profession is really like a performance, making him even more barbaric than a barbarian.
