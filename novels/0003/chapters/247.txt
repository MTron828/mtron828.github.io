Chapter 248: The Mage's Shattering Technique

Is it impossible for Death to revive?

What about the thirteen coffins of the high-ranking mages in the underground temple? And what about the "artificial Death God" that Larissa mentioned, which can escape?

Suddenly, a multitude of questions rushed into Zhao Xu's mind, making him feel overwhelmed, like a tangled thread that was hard to unravel.

Unfortunately, Larissa was still in a state of deep sleep due to the exhaustion of her earlier usage, making it impossible for him to ask her questions.

If not, he could have played a game of poker with three players in his mind.

"The reason we cannot enter that half-plane is mainly because it has been contaminated by the aura of Death, and also carries the wrath of Death's previous existence."

"The stronger the living being, the greater the danger once it reaches the internal core area. Therefore, after losing the three avatars of the gods, our exploration of that half-plane was put on hold, and we used it to observe the aftermath left by Death."

It turned out that danger and strength were out of balance.

In the peripheral area of that half-plane, everyone was the same.

But once you entered the core area, the danger increased with the level.

Perhaps this was also one of the considerations for him to obtain the additional specialization now.

After asking Altoira, the other party continued to fall into a deep sleep, as if they were taking a rare and precious vacation, cherishing every moment of sleep.

Zhao Xu also walked out of the "Lawyer's Mansion" space, standing on the hilltop and gazing out at the entire tranquil and rippling Star Lake, just like he had done nine years ago on the night he went out on patrol.

The duration of the mansion's magic was two hours per level, which means it could sustain for 60 hours, enough to last until the end of this battle. Zhao Xu planned to return here late at night to rest.

After communicating with Artesia, he felt the need to modify his previous infiltration plan.

For Zhao Xu, the greatest advantage was that he knew the location he was going to infiltrate intimately, thanks to his past life. He didn't need to conduct any preliminary reconnaissance work.

Zhao Xu took out a map of the "Starfall Town" at this moment, and all the treasures of the town had converged to the central "Government Office" in the underground treasure vault.

In reality, the miners knew that if their brains weren't burned, they would focus on guarding the treasure vault. If they really lost, the treasure vault would contain the accumulated wealth over several decades, which would be the capital for their future resurgence.

Zhao Xu now had the "Mental Barrier" with eight rings, which made all detection methods and devices completely ineffective. The only question was that most of the transmission detection methods were equipped with transmission alarm systems, so he couldn't use the "High-Level Transmission Technique" to directly reach the core.

Like transmission spells, they would be restricted by the "Dimension Anchor" and "Dimension Lock" spells, which would block transmission. However, Zhao Xu's methods went beyond this.

The strong reason for a mage was that, in order to achieve a goal, there were often multiple options available.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu first cast the "High-Level Invisibility" spell, and regardless of whether he launched an attack, he would not become visible. Meanwhile, this spell, which lasts for one round at each level, can be sustained for 24 hours after being cast using the "Divine Magic: Spell Duration" spell. After this operation, he obtained the effect of the "Invisibility Ring", which was worth more than 20,000 gold coins in his hand.

Then, Zhao Xu simulated the Druid's seven-ring spell, "Earth's Grasp". The land beneath his feet suddenly became transparent and empty. The entire terrain looked as if it had collapsed into a pit, and Zhao Xu directly fell into it. Until his figure disappeared, the hillside returned to its original hardness, and even the dirt was not disturbed, with wild grasses still firmly rooted. Zhao Xu was now effortlessly moving through the soil and rocks underground, as if he were soaring through the sky like a bird in flight. His speed was also increasing rapidly, comparable to lightning.

"You said we won't be breached this time?" said one young guard standing at the entrance to the treasure room, looking tired around midnight. He was chatting with his partner, who was standing guard alongside him. "Impossible, have you ever seen a sandcastle that can withstand a flood? With our years of training, we can set up an array that will leave them lost," said another guard who had fought on the battlefield. He was a former soldier of the Northern Alliance who had retired due to injury and later married a woman from the Star Lake area and joined her family. As a result of his connections with the mining association, he was able to get this lucrative job of guarding the treasure room.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Huh, what's the point of guarding this treasure trove? We've been monitoring the dimensional fluctuations and someone's been listening in on the ground floor. Even someone inside has appeared. We all know what's going on. How can we possibly need to stay here and guard it? It's better to head into battle and earn some extra gold."

The veteran guard shook his head and said, "Hey, I'm not as young as you. I'm happy to just stay here and die old and peacefully."

"Yeah, big brother, have you heard?" one of the younger guards whispered, looking around nervously. "I heard those slaves have been dealt with?"

The older guard turned back and looked at the younger one, then leaned in and whispered, "Yes, they've been dealt with. We just throw whatever we find into the furnace. Otherwise, when the temple's investigation team comes, we won't be able to explain the extra people."

"That's ruthless enough," the younger guard said, surprised that the guild could be so merciless.

"Well, you think they squeezed out all the other mine owners," the older guard sneered.

However, just as they were talking, a door suddenly opened on the ground floor, and Zhao Xu burst out of the ground, using his "Terra Dominus" spell.

Unfortunately, the scanning devices on Zhao Xu's body were blocked by his "Soul Shield" after a quick scan.

Zhao Xu relied on his "Soul Shield" and "Terra Dominus" spells to complete the feat that countless adventurers could not, and he successfully entered the treasure trove in Starfall Town.

However, he didn't immediately start searching through the dusty bookshelves for mineral distribution records and hidden information. Instead, he looked at a dark corner of the treasure trove.

Because the records on the bookshelves may not be comprehensive, Zhao Xu thought to himself.

"Ah, true knowledge?" Just then, a man with a silver-white aura walked out of the shadows, looking at Zhao Xu with a hint of surprise.
Here is the translation:

"The priest of the magical goddess has been staying here for decades. It's as if he just remembered the significance of the symbol on the man before him.

"'Master of the Jade Star'?" Zhao Xu asked hesitantly.

Although he had already had an answer in his heart, he still had to correct him. "Oh, although you can recall my profession's origin, I still must correct you - you should address me as Master of the Silver Star instead."

The man smiled, his body seeming to be made entirely of silver, with a mechanical stiffness to it.

Zhao Xu had been seeking this man, who was the target of his visit and the reason he came to this treasure library.

Recalling the legend of players who had rushed into this treasure library and been defeated by the Master of the Silver Star, Zhao Xu took it seriously.

He learned from the legend library and knowledge skills that "Master of the Jade Star" was an intermediate-level advancement, considered half-arcane.

The reason it was considered half-arcane was that this advancement had 10 levels in total, but only the odd-numbered levels would enhance one's arcane abilities.

So, even though the man before him was a 20-level master, it would only be equivalent to a 15-level mage.

This advancement required finding corresponding metal star mines and then absorbing their energy.

The star mines referred to the original stones brought down from the sky after meteorites fell.

This was also the reason why the other party appeared at "Falling Star Lake", which was the secret silver mine of the Northern Alliance.

"As I gaze at your eyes, it seems like you're familiar with our profession's abilities."

The man suddenly revealed a thoughtful expression, saying, "It seems that after eternal life, many things lose their sensitivity."

"I'll introduce myself first - I'm Ferguson, a seven-ring mage." The man, calling himself Ferguson, spoke to Zhao Xu."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Immortal!
Seven rings!
Zhao Xiu immediately reacted, realizing that the man in front of him had already reached level 10.
When the Jade Star Master reaches level 10, they will resemble metal sculptures. At this time, they also become "constructs".
And just like the golems, they will receive eternal life.
This means that the man in front of him, Ferguson, is an 18-level strong being, with the abilities of an 8-level mage and a 10-level Jade Star Master.
Because he wasted 5 levels of spellcasting ability, he is actually weaker than a 18-level mage who can only cast nine rings.
"'Magic God, Wind,' Zhao Xiu whispered.
'Yes, I've been waiting here since the meteor fell. So, strictly speaking, the miners who came after me are not considered to have trespassed.'
'That's what you're here for?' Ferguson slowly said, his voice filled with a sense of metal and a hint of nostalgia.
'Mainly to investigate the inner workings of the Star Lake,' Zhao Xiu said, looking calmly at the man in front of him.
He had learned that the mysterious tomb of the ancient civilization might be hidden at the bottom of the Star Lake.
He then focused his target on the man who had witnessed the development of the Star Lake.
High-level professionals will not take rash actions, even if they have a grudge to settle.
This is also the reason why he dared to come here, knowing that the other person was present.
'Oh, it seems you're here to ask me something,' Ferguson suddenly shook his head, 'I have to deal with a few unexpected guests every year. I'll have to collect fees from the miners, too.'"

His tone suddenly became cold and icy, "Defeat me, and I'll tell you everything." "Master, he's not just a seven-ring mage, oh." Suddenly, Lux's soft and gentle voice came from afar. "Spell of Shattering." But Frigga's spell had already been charged and was ready to be unleashed.
