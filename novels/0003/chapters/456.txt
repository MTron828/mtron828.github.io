Chapter 457: The White Dragon's Rest

After Zhao Xu and the "Legendary Mage" who suddenly appeared won against Gou Ruo, they continued to play the role of coachmen, driving the horse-drawn carriage carrying An Ti Nuo Ya and Wei Wei An, and continued to drive through the snow-covered terrain.

Although they could easily reach the capital city of the Northern Alliance by using the "Higher Transmission Technique" that allowed them to teleport, An Ti Nuo Ya, as a magician, could also cast the Higher Transmission Technique on her own, and Wei Wei An, as a demon, had the ability to cast the Higher Transmission Technique. Even Zhao Xu had a "Passage Rod" that allowed him to cast the Higher Transmission Technique.

However, they refused to use it and instead chose to drive through the snow-covered terrain.

As Zhao Xu cast the "Endurance" spell on himself, the temperature around him stabilized, and the cold wind that had been piercing through his clothes was no longer unbearable.

As they journeyed from the Winter City to Oulu, it seemed that the snow had suppressed the travel wishes of countless travelers.

The monsters, too, were preoccupied with the thought of winter, and their activities were affected by the continuous blizzard. They could only start distributing the food they had stockpiled earlier, and as a result, they did not encounter many monster ambushes along the way.

The monsters were lucky to have escaped disaster.

On the second day, after Wei Wei An opened the carriage curtain and cast a spell to block the cold wind, she began to gaze at Zhao Xu's back, re-casting the "Follow-up Magic Course" for him.
The process was mostly a question-and-answer session between two people. After Zhao Xu achieved 28 wisdom, Anniya could finally relax and ask Zhao Xu questions. The two began to discuss topics with each other, moving from a one-way inquiry to a mutual discussion. Zhao Xu also realized that Anniya's questions were not very profound, but required him to have a deep understanding of the entire magical system. It was like a test of whether he was qualified as a "setter" of questions.

As the head of the small town branch of the Mage Association, Zhao Xu received supervision from the Winter's Capital Mage Association and the Northern Alliance Mage Department above him. Below him, he had to complete the basic "apprentice training" work. At the same time, he also had to organize the few mages in the small town and help them answer some academic questions related to magic.

From this moment on, Zhao Xu felt that some problems needed him to take personal responsibility and solve them personally, just like when he was a justice officer in his past life. In this process, the idle time during the year brought a surge in new players entering the game, according to the messages on the forum.

However, when the fifth month of the game's operation arrived, most players had completed their professional training and begun their game journey. This led to the first wave of "complete death" in the game. Complete death refers to a situation where a player has used up all five resurrection stones and has no other means of revival, ultimately leading to the tragic demise of the game character.

On the forum, the protests against the game have increased, with many players expressing their dissatisfaction and frustration. Some players have even deleted their characters in response, citing the game's "absolute death" mechanism as the reason. The game company has yet to issue a formal response to these concerns.

Zhao Xu, the protagonist, has been trying to encourage and guide the players who have posted their concerns, but many of them have ignored his responses. As the year-end holiday is approaching, Zhao Xu's horse-drawn carriage is slowly approaching the city of Orlo, which is located near the northern border of the frozen wilderness.

In reality, the northern alliance, including the entire northern region, has been severely affected by the harsh winter weather since the winter began. If it weren't for the fact that the horses can fly, the carriage would not have been able to withstand the harsh weather and would not have been able to reach Orlo quickly.

The northern alliance, which is able to claim the title of "North" due to its close proximity to the ice mountain range, is also the most affected by the monstrous creatures that inhabit the ice mountain range. As a result, the northern alliance has become the dominant force in the region, with a strong military presence.

As Zhao Xu and An Ti Niya were discussing the legendary mage's "Star Boundary Projection" technique, which allowed him to split himself, suddenly, Zhao Xu heard a faint strange sound.

He listened more closely.

At that moment, a loud, long howl echoed from in front of them, through the ice and snow, unashamedly expressing the emotions of the monster.

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat, and he gazed into the distance.

However, his vision was affected by the countless, soft, and fluffy snowflakes that fell from the sky, and the gusts of wind that blew by, making it seem like a mist.

If he hadn't worn black-tinted glasses, he would have suffered from snow blindness.

"Let's take a look," An Ti Niya said.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied.

Apparently, good Samaritans who hear strange noises in the wilderness usually start a fire or quickly pack up and leave. But not Zhao Xu and An Ti Niya, who knew that the mountain had tigers and decided to venture forth.

Zhao Xu didn't know if An Ti Niya was interested in the white wolf skin rug on the ice or if she was just enthusiastic about exploring. However, he didn't hesitate, and with a shout, he urged his warhorse forward, heading in the direction indicated by An Ti Niya's pointing.

With Zhao Xu's three-legged cat-like hearing skills, unless he used magic to enhance his hearing, he could only hear the sound of the wind in the icy wilderness, which remained unchanged, no matter how hard he tried to listen.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, for someone like Anniya who has piled up the "listening" skill to an unprecedented level, even if the conversation is as quiet as a whisper a hundred meters away, she can still hear it as clearly as if it were being whispered into her ear.

"Eagle's Eye Technique."

With Anniya's spellcasting ability exceeding level 70, the Eagle's Eye Technique, a long-distance spell, has a direct range of over a thousand meters.

She had already used her listening skill to directly and clearly obtain the source and distance of the sound, without any obstacles, and then used the Eagle's Eye Technique to sense and transmit everything that had happened a hundred meters away to Zhao Xu.

After understanding the situation, Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrowed in surprise.

It really was an encounter with a monster.

In an instant, Zhao Xu charged into the center of the sound's origin area on his fast-moving shadow steed.

At that moment, a merchant party of about twenty people was desperately resisting an attack by over thirty winter wolves on the other side.

On the ground, ten guards lay motionless, their armor stained with blood, their faces pale and stiff from the cold. These winter wolves, over two meters tall, were prolific breeders in the ice wilderness and hunted in groups. With their cunning and terrifying spittle weapons, they could easily overwhelming their opponents through repeated attacks.

The leader of the group, a man with a lion's tail helmet, looked relieved when he saw someone approaching through the snowstorm, thinking that reinforcements had arrived.

However, his smile froze when he saw a ordinary horse-drawn carriage instead of the expected reinforcements.

It was as if he had won the lottery, only to be told that he hadn't bought a ticket. His emotions were a mix of excitement and disappointment.

He had just sent out a distress call for reinforcements, but where were they?
Here is the translation:

"What's going on with this result?

At that time, the other guards who had been smiling and cheerful because of the snowstorm couldn't clearly see the details of Zhao Xu's carriage because of the wind and snow. However, they could clearly judge that the carriage in front of them was a wagon that had ventured out into the harsh winter weather, with no fighting power at all.

"Damn it, how can this be? Am I really going to die here?" one of the young guards, who had been biting his teeth and persevering until now, suddenly broke down and began to cry uncontrollably.

"Stop crying and hurry up and assemble!" a warrior dressed in full armor shouted loudly, seemingly dissatisfied with his companion's emotional outburst.

"As a player, you can revive, of course. I'm just a bodyguard, after all. I never thought I'd encounter something like this. I haven't even settled down yet," the emotional man cried even louder.

Zhao Xu was holding the reins lightly, slowing down the carriage, but the words of the other party were clear and audible to him, making him feel a bit puzzled.

During the New Year's holiday, players had time to play games, but it was impossible to guarantee continuous online time.

So he was wondering why someone would send players on a mission at this time.

Moreover, looking at their appearance, which was covered in dust and mud, it was clear that they were not prepared for this massive snowstorm, implying that they had left before the New Year.

"Kill those wolves, and I'll change the carpet in my bedroom," Anzhenya instructed directly."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu heard it and couldn't help but smile awkwardly, and it actually came true. In an instant, he looked at the wolves in front of him, revealing a warm and amiable smile. "However, you still need to be careful behind you, because a young white dragon is hiding there," Anzhiya whispered softly, as if she was unaware that the creature she was referring to was a powerful being like a dragon. "Forget it, winter wolf fur isn't very good, and I don't want it anyway. Just take down that white dragon for me."
