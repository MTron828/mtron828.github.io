Chapter 213: Fearful Binding Spirit

The Fearful Binding Spirit's entire body resembled a delicate silk fabric piled up in mid-air, floating and drifting like a ghostly apparition. However, its essence was entirely composed of darkness, with red eyes fixed on Zhao Xu, regarding him as prey.

Zhao Xu immediately activated his "Darkness Knowledge (Tactics)" ability, attempting to find the weaknesses of this creature before him.

Zhao Xu's only impression of this Fearful Binding Spirit was its name and that its challenge level exceeded level 10. He had also heard of its weakened version, the "Binding Spirit", which had a challenge level of 5, from his past life.

From the floating body, it was clear that this Fearful Binding Spirit was similar to a ghost, a type of undead being.

In the past, the ghost had left Zhao Xu's team utterly helpless, with half the reason being the ghost's immense power, which came with several supernatural abilities.

The ghost could actively emit a "Fearsome Wail" sonic attack within a certain range, as well as the "Corrosive Gaze" visual attack, and even the "Corrosive Touch" attack that could take effect upon contact.

These special attacks that could erode properties had made the ghost's "Spear" (矛) formidable.

The "Virtual Body" trait, on the other hand, was the ghost's "Shield", which was also the Fearful Binding Spirit's shield.

To counter the Virtual Body, only magical weapons could take effect, with a 50% success rate, similar to magical attacks.

As Zhao Xu was still searching for knowledge and analyzing the situation, the Fearful Binding Spirit suddenly swooped down, pouncing on him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's entire attention was fully concentrated at this moment, and his years of combat experience allowed him to judge that the opponent's attack power was at least above 15 levels.

Even with the stacking mage armor and shield spell, it was uncertain whether he could block it.

As Zhao Xu was thinking, the "Fearful Binding Spirit" had already extended a ghostly, eerie hand from the mist-like body, touching him.

At this moment, his cloak burst into a starlight at the point of contact, shining brightly.

[The adventurer Zhong Xia received the "Fearful Binding Spirit"'s "Body Touch" attack, and the Starlight Cloak triggered its effect, making him immune to the attack.]

Zhao Xu's heart rate accelerated slightly, but his face remained calm.

Originally, he would prioritize survival above all else, but now, in this situation, he had to judge things based on his own guesses, rather than seeking complete victory.

Zhao Xu judged that the "Fearful Binding Spirit" did not have magical weapons.

As long as the opponent's innate weapon did not possess magical weapon characteristics, it would not be able to penetrate his starlight cloak's defense.

At this moment, his knowledge of dark arts (tactics) and religious knowledge fed back to him, allowing him to instantly understand the characteristics of the "Fearful Binding Spirit".

The effect of the attack Zhao Xu just dodged was called "Body Touch", and if successful, it would absorb 1-8 points from his physical constitution.

The key point was that the super natural ability had a high difficulty of 25 levels.

Zhao Xu, with his 14 physical constitution, would definitely be hit and killed by this attack, unable to withstand even two or three rounds before dying.

Then, according to the feedback from his knowledge skills, any living being killed by the "Fearful Binding Spirit" would be transformed into a derivative, becoming an ordinary "Binding Spirit" and being enslaved by the opponent after death.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, the ancient and terrifying 'Feng Ling' entity, which usually only appears in forgotten temples and abandoned tombs deep within, is generally unable to attack actively. However, even if the mummies behind him have already risen up, Zhao Xu still doesn't take the initiative to attack. The negative energy field around him causes 10 points of negative energy damage per round. Once he takes action, the effect of the "Inescapable Curtain" spell will cease, and Zhao Xu's life force will be on the brink of collapse. Instead, he relies on the protection of the Stellar Cloak and feels safer. The undead creatures surrounding him mostly have effects that can harm his physical body, but their supernatural abilities won't take effect unless they hit him. Therefore, Zhao Xu is in a state of immunity to damage before the undead creatures cast spells or use magical weapons. This is also why Zhao Xu is unwilling to give up the Stellar Cloak. When the mummies rush towards him, they see the 'Feng Ling' entity attacking Zhao Xu without any reaction and are all confused. Alternatively, the fear of higher-level undead creatures causes them to learn to be patient and wait. The 'Feng Ling' entity that attacked Zhao Xu became angry and let out a loud roar after realizing its attack had failed. Unfortunately, its roar had no supernatural effects, and Zhao Xu just heard a terrifying sound effect. On the other hand, the ghostly entities with a challenge level of 5-6, which have supernatural abilities, still require Zhao Xu to be cautious. These creatures with a single type of attack, from the 'Super Small Variant Spider' with a challenge level of less than 1 to the 'Feng Ling' entity with a challenge level of 11, are all unable to threaten Zhao Xu."
Here is the translation of the text:

This is also the effect of the team, everyone's abilities are not much different, but when combined, they become comprehensive and can overcome various difficulties. When facing a powerful creature with strong magic resistance, Zhao Xu would find it challenging before he had successfully enhanced his melee abilities. It's like dealing with ordinary undead creatures that only have basic attacks.

At this moment, the "Fearful Spirit" creatures from afar have also noticed the situation and are flying over. Zhao Xu was startled when he saw the silhouette of one of them and was about to flee, even considering using his "Teleportation Boots" to create some distance.

Suddenly, a "Fearful Spirit" with a more robust body floated into view, its hands not retracted into its body, but holding a faintly visible giant scythe.

Last night, Zhao Xu used the "Mystical Enhancement" spell to imbue the giant sword in Qian Ye's hand with magic, making it possible to deal damage to the ghostly body because magical weapons are effective against ghostly bodies.

However, the effectiveness of this method is only an increase from 0% to 50%, and there is still a 50% chance of failure. This is because ghostly bodies are between the spiritual realm and the material world.

No one knows when you swing your weapon, whether the opponent is in the material world or the spiritual realm. This is the legendary Schrödinger state of the ghostly body.

However, when the "Ghostly" feature appears, all problems are solved. The "Ghostly" feature, unless the entire world is filled with ghosts and spirits, is a rare and unusual feature that Zhao Xu has never seen a powerful warrior wield. Normally, ghostly bodies cannot hold magical weapons. However, when magical weapons have the "Ghostly" feature, ghostly bodies can use them.
Here is the translation of the text:

This also means that the "Fearful Entwined Spirit" is holding a "magical weapon" that can cause harm to Zhao Xu. Although Zhao Xu successfully dodges the attack and can avoid half of the damage, the problem is that the "Fearful Entwined Spirit" can cause harm to Zhao Xu's supernatural abilities, which is the most troublesome aspect.

Zhao Xu has entered a state of mind where he is as calm as still water. He knows that this battle has exceeded the normal level of difficulty. Even if there are mages with the same conditions, they would not be able to come here without his exceptional equipment, and they would all die.

The Mage Association is not like the cliché stories where a genius appears and is then eliminated. It welcomes geniuses and even expects their appearance. Therefore, this level of difficulty is a bit strange.

Or, when the gardener who takes care of the flowers and plants in the manor pointed him in the direction here, it implies that he is special, and the difficulty is higher.

This difficulty also makes Zhao Xu think that the people, including Wang Qingwei, did not enter from here. There are multiple entrances to the "semi-dimensional realm". It's possible that they appeared at a different location in the "carnivorous beast semi-dimensional realm".

After Zhao Xu's mind becomes calm, numerous associations about this challenge begin to scatter in his mind. The "Fearful Entwined Spirit" holding the giant scythe also gets closer to him.

When Zhao Xu performs a knowledge check, he receives a perfect score of 20, and he gains a lot of knowledge about the "Fearful Entwined Spirit". One of the points reveals the weakness of the "Fearful Entwined Spirit" - it will lose its ability and flee in the sunlight.
Here's the translation:

Unfortunately, it's "sunlight" rather than "firelight", otherwise Zhao Xu would have pulled out the fire torch from his backpack.

The "daylight technique" that can create a "sunlight effect" is the Three-Ring Technique.

One level down from a dead person, that's Zhao Xu's current situation.

Who would have thought that facing a challenge of level 11, with a life die directly approaching 16HD, Zhao Xu can still suppress it with just a "daylight technique".

This is the power of knowledge.

Slowly, the "Fearful Spirit" has crept up to a distance of less than six or seven meters away from Zhao Xu.
Zhao Xu smiled calmly, looking at the opponent as if he didn't care about his own life or death.
Until the "Fearful Spirit" approached Zhao Xu, reaching the giant scythe's attack range, it directly swung its scythe.

The followers of Death God consider the giant scythe with the "beheading" magical feature to be a sacred instrument. Because once they successfully strike, the scythe is not only the highest fourfold critical hit among all weapons, but also has the "beheading" effect of instantly killing - harvesting death.
However, everything was too late.

Zhao Xu's entire body suddenly burst forth with a powerful light, like the sun descending upon the square.

The holy magic "Radiant Shield"!
