Chapter 503, Level 8

"Die!" the woman on the platform exclaimed in anger, drawing back her composite longbow and shouting, "Crimson Blaze!"

Instantly, the arrow in her hand burst into flames, clearly due to the fiery aura weapon she possessed, which also granted the arrow 1-6 additional fire damage.

However, Zhao Xiu remained calm and said, "Lanaia, withdraw!"

"Whoosh!" Another arrow flew through the air, serving as a response to Zhao Xiu.

This arrow was aimed at Zhao Xiu's chest, but the invisible force field in front of him resisted it, causing the arrow to graze his shoulder and then fall to the ground behind him. The arrow then exploded, transforming into a burning flame.

"What do you know about my name?" the girl asked, looking at Zhao Xiu with a puzzled expression.

At the same time, the passageways surrounding the cave began to emerge, with people slowly pouring in to provide support. Most of them wore ferocious expressions.

One particularly burly half-human male, wearing only a loincloth and leggings, was struggling to break free from the iron chain that bound him to a winter wolf. The wolf's jaws were constantly snapping, and its saliva dripped to the ground as it tried to break free and charge at Zhao Xiu.

"Sorry."

"One-ring spell, self-buff, 'Fear Not', double the charge damage."

As Zhao Xiu finished speaking, "Swift Speed" and "Swift Flight" two-ring spells took effect, allowing him to simultaneously possess the abilities of acceleration and flight, just like a cannonball shooting out.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu hovered in mid-air like a ghostly shadow, his entire body twisting 135 degrees, but the wooden rod in his hand remained unwavering. As he charged towards the half-human, he struck the half-human's head with immense force, sending the half-human flying.

The impact of the charge, amplified by the three abilities "Fearless", "Unusual Strike", and "Ghostly Technique", sent the half-human's head spinning, and the entire person was knocked flying away.

The winter wolf, originally intended to spew out icy mist energy, instead stood up straight, its snow-white fur standing on end, and its limbs kicked towards the other side of the person tide. This intimidation was only seen on the body of the Wolf King.

However, looking at the direction in which it was fleeing, the mouth of the cave where over 20 people had gathered, with many of them holding long spears, ready to throw them at it.

" Extreme Magic: Fireball Technique."
In an instant, a fireball carrying the scent of burning and destruction shot forward.

"It's a mage, run!" exclaimed Lanyia, the youngest sister, standing on the high platform.

But before her voice could reach the ears of the crowd, the fireball had exploded like fireworks, releasing a blinding flash of fire that could kill on the spot.

The strong gust of wind even knocked down Lanyia, who was about to jump off the high platform.

She could only stare blankly at the scene before her, where the ground, stained with the blood of captives, had turned dark red and was now blackened. The original bloodstains had also faded significantly.

The tribe members and subordinates of the six sisters lay scattered on the ground, their bodies charred and unrecognizable, their limbs stiff and their hands clawing like paws, as if they had suffered immense pain before death.

"Boom."
"Boom."
"Boom."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhou Xu in the cave below was like a bird flying freely in a cage, darting back and forth in all directions, only to retreat every time, his wooden staff crashing down onto the fish that had just slipped through his grasp.

These mercenaries guarding the entrance noticed that no matter what defensive posture they adopted, they were unable to withstand the attacks of this mage, who would strike them with a "head-on blow" at any moment.

Even as they raised their iron shields, the wooden staff's shadow seemed to disappear into thin air, only to reappear on the other side of the shield, striking with incredible force.

When Lanaia regained her composure after the shock of the fireball attack, she found that the mage had already slaughtered the second wave of reinforcements that had arrived to support them.

"Devil, you devil," Lanaia shouted, knowing that something was amiss, and with incredible speed, she drew out the dagger she had concealed in her leg, using a cunning and agile stance to strike at Zhou Xu.

"Biggie's rush punch."
In an instant, Zhou Xu let out a short, sharp cry, and before Lanaia could even fully raise her dagger, she felt a massive, blazing "force fist" hurtling towards her.

It was like a hammer blow, striking every inch of her body with incredible force.

Her slender figure, already somewhat frail, was sent flying backward, crashing into the stone wall behind her, causing even the wall to crumble and send dust flying everywhere.

The attack power of Biggie's rush punch, adjusted by the mage's level and intelligence, and further adjusted by the force of the punch, reached an incredible 39 levels, making it a generally unbeatable attack.

Zhou Xu knelt down, gazing at the familiar features before him, shaking his head in disapproval.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although he had just swung his bat, as long as he paid attention to the method, he could easily knock down Lanaia and cause non-fatal injuries. However, he couldn't resist the temptation of her unparalleled one-punch knockout.

In his previous life, he had met Lanaia in a bar during his adventurous journey after his family was destroyed. He had to admit that her unusual black hair and similar facial features to Zheng Xin Yu's made him lose his senses for a moment.

As a result, he, who seemed powerful and could roam freely in the tavern as a 5th-level warrior, was instead taught a lesson and had to flee in a humiliating manner. However, due to a surprise ambush by bandits outside the city, the two of them eventually became acquainted and traveled together for a while.

At that time, Lanaia had already advanced to 9th-level Ranger Lin Zai Shen, naturally surpassing Zhao Xu. When it was time to part ways, Lanaia invited Zhao Xu to her old home, saying that she had some famous wine from her hometown. Zhao Xu agreed to go.

However, when he arrived at the hideout, Zhao Xu discovered that his former companion was actually one of the notorious "Six Sisters" who secretly worked for some powerful figures behind the scenes. Zhao Xu ultimately chose to cut off his ties with Lanaia, who would not leave her sister's side.

When faced with the Six Sisters who wanted to kill him, Zhao Xu had prepared to sacrifice himself, but he was saved by Lanaia's desperate defense. Now, Lanaia is still in a state of unconsciousness, and Zhao Xu can end her life with a single blow to the temple with his wooden stick.

He, however, had no idea of taking action.

Later, he dragged Lyra's body and took her to a secluded spot on the high platform.

Zhou Xu directly lifted his hand and cast a spell, throwing a thick rope from his backpack and scattering grain and igniting a scroll of written curses on sheepskin paper.

"Time Extension: Binding Spell."

A spell that Zhou Xu knew for a long time but had never used before was suddenly cast.

Instantly, the rope seemed to come to life, like a snake, and rose into the air.

Then, a rift appeared in the void, and the rope climbed up to a dimension outside the multiverse.

Zhou Xu immediately bound the other end to Lyra's waist, gave her a pack of dry rations and water, and then pulled the rope back into space.

Just as the rope was about to be completely retracted, the rift was about to be sealed at the moment.

Zhou Xu suddenly lifted his hand and cast a spell, "Detect Evil."

No light appeared.

Then, the rift in space was completely sealed.

This rift in space, to the outside world, was invisible, unless one had true knowledge, and could not be seen otherwise. But after Lyra woke up, she could observe the outside world through a one-meter-square window of the invisible rift.

Meanwhile, this hour-level spell, which Zhou Xu extended in time, could last for two days.

"Well, live well," Zhou Xu said, just like Lyra had said goodbye to Zhou Xu in the previous life.

No matter what, he ultimately found it difficult to take Lyra's life.

Perhaps he was born without the ability to hate and kill like a snake, and could not reach the level of doing great justice.
Here is the translation of the text:

As it seems now, Lana has not yet fully joined the "evil camp" and has not become the "Death Archer" among the six sisters in the later world. This is also because her level is not high enough compared to the opponent, and she can only stay in her den.

Just then, Zhao Xu mocked himself with a sentence.

Even if he had just discovered that the opponent was evil, would he really take action?

At this time, his eyes slowly cleared up.

In the void, an intangible energy seemed to scatter around him, slowly condensing.

On the coordinate axis of Zhao Xu's character card array, the scale of the chaotic camp became increasingly profound.

Immediately, he jumped down from this high platform, his eyes looking at the black shadow in the cave ahead, gradually growing cold.

The other five sisters, I'm sorry.

"Ah." The sound of a hand slapping a wooden stick echoed through the air. The top of the stick was stuck to the wall.

He walked towards the incredibly dark depths.
