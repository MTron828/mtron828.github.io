Chapter 056: Shock

"You're saying this title is funny?" Zhang Qi laughed as he opened this post, "In this day and age, title parties that seek to please the crowd can even make it to the top of the forum, I don't know what the administrators think."

Zhao Xu's eyes widened as he read the title.

In Arthur's church, these players who have no connection to Arthur's homeland are not good at being bought. Initially, they can be placed in lower-level positions that may allow them to access confidential information, without worrying about their relationship with the families in Mistral City. Players can sometimes be the most innocent people.

However, when secrets fall into the hands of players, one must prepare oneself mentally for the possibility that the secret may be known to all players.

Internet communication is always zero-distance.

Zhao Xu believed that the female clerk who stored the secret was absolutely trained in confidentiality by the temple. She even underwent a rigorous examination before being assigned to that internal position.

He also believed that this title was definitely not from that female clerk.

However, humans have a natural tendency to share and exchange with friends.

A screenshot of five people's group chat was posted, which could spread to the entire network if it was forwarded again.

At this point, he realized that the few priests he had contacted yesterday afternoon had indirectly confirmed that he was a novice priest at the Saint Heart Cathedral.

This is what sparked the explosive post.

"Xu Brother, look at the comments in this post, I'm dying laughing."

Zhao Xu did not want to attract attention and trouble, and he didn't need the kind of fame.

However, he was curious about how people would comment on this event online. He saw some comments saying things like:

"Oh, another player went crazy during training and went down, and the next one will."

"The previous fastest priest record was how long? Oh, 9 days, which is only achievable by a weak player."

"This year, even people don't know how to do their homework before making things up."

"Editor of XX News, welcome to join us!"

"If this is really true, please come out and prove it? If it's true, I'll do a backflip and eat my words."

"Don't rush to eat hot pot, saying that someone has completed the training in one day? What if they have used up their five resurrection stones and started a new character?"

"Hey, the average IQ of the forum is being dragged down by people like these. Other professions might be possible, but priests need to master their skills and wait in line, okay?"

"I finally got all the necessary skills after half a month of effort, and I was waiting to level up. But then I heard someone completed the training in one day? If it's true, I'll cancel my account and stop bothering me with this nonsense."

As Zhao Xu looked at these comments, he couldn't help but chuckle. It seemed that everyone didn't believe the original poster's claim.

So he felt relieved.

After going through the intense training, which still required a lot of time and effort, every player, from physical to mental, had to go through a test.

In general, everyone acknowledged that players who could complete the training quickly were indeed talented.

However, when he saw someone who had reached the top, he suddenly realized that the "ceiling" he had seen before was just the first floor's ceiling. Someone had already climbed to the fifth floor.
Here is the translation:

"Hey, if it's really possible to become a level 1 priest in just one day, I'd definitely delete my account and switch to a new one. No, I don't just mean one day, I'd accept it even if it takes a week," Zhang Qi complained.

"Is it that difficult?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

In his past life, he had joined the game just eight months ago, and his teammates had all been equipped with priests from the start. Any healing spell could fill him up from zero health to full health instantly. At that time, he had no idea how difficult leveling up really was.

"You don't know the hardships of the outside world," Zhang Qi glared at Zhao Xu, who looked unimpressed.

Zhang Qi knew Zhao Xu was a mage who had just started his journey and didn't know when he would graduate. "If someone could guarantee that I could level up to become a priest in two weeks, or a month, I dare say that the team of priests would line up at the city gate."

"There's a huge shortage of healers. In previous online games, priests would drink blue potions to recover health, or give players back their health. Or players would drink red potions to recover health."

"This broken game, Arthur, is too cruel. Priests use up their divine spells by the end of the day and can't recover. As a result, many people pretend to be followers and go to church to scrounge for healing."

"Can't you buy them?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

"Xu, a bottle of light wound potion costs 50 gold coins, who can afford it?" Zhang Qi said.

Zhao Xu finally snapped out of it, thinking that the healing potions used in battles were not something to be taken lightly.

In his past life, he had been a justice officer and had connections and could buy cheap and effective potions from the temple. However, for the current player community, even just buying recovery items was a luxury. Many players had already spent all their initial funds on equipment and armor.

It's not that Arthur is being serious, players only have a projection relationship and don't need to prepare food and drink. However, various adventure materials, from backpacks to flint stones, iron plates, and iron lotus, have no bottom line in terms of cost. Recently, the most popular post on the forum has changed from monster strategy to part-time job strategy. Even players who haven't completed their professional training are upgrading their skills and doing part-time jobs to earn money.

"Buy a bunch of nonsense," Zhang Qi said. "If anyone can bring out medical supplies, the guild will likely elect them as chairman. Ah, even a priest may be able to become chairman."

When he heard this, Zhao Xu nodded slightly and ignored the next sentence.

He leaned against the wizard's association and the church, and it wasn't difficult to get those materials. However, sending them away was a long way, and he had an idea, but could only say it later.

Arthur's first month was still in its infancy, and most players were still struggling, with only a few successfully graduating from their profession. He didn't rush to set up a plan, and what was more important was his own leveling up.

...

The next day, Zhao Xu deliberately logged in to the game early and reappeared in his room in the floating city.

Before An Ti Noya arrived, he started preparing an hour of magic and divine magic.

He didn't stop until two hours later, when An Ti Noya arrived as scheduled, holding something in her hand.

"What do we learn next?" Zhao Xu asked.

He hadn't seen An Ti Noya since the night before, and Zhao Xu didn't have much to chat about, so he got straight to the point.

"Not in a hurry," he said. "The reward you won last time, I brought it with me today." An Ti Noya spoke briefly and to the point.
Zhao Xu suddenly regained his composure, still thinking about how to hint at it, but unexpectedly, An Tianya directly opened her mouth.

"Take it," An Tianya directly handed over the thing she was holding in her hand.

"What backpack?" Zhao Xu's face was blank as he looked at the thing in his hand.
