Chapter 530: Give Me an Explanation!

For the next half a month, Zhao Xu also boarded the train back to school, with the rotating wheels like the shadow of a setting sun, stretching and moving away from his hometown.

Before leaving, he glanced at the city's last glow, and then turned around and walked into the carriage without looking back.

Sometimes, the last glance can occur unintentionally, and no one knows that it's a goodbye.

On the train, Zhao Xu gazed at fellow students who were also heading back to school, everyone except for the initial reluctance to leave home, also had excitement to meet familiar classmates.

He remained silent the whole time, gazing out the window like a solitary wanderer, passing through this fleeting time.

On the other hand, as time passed, the progress of the players in Azeroth also accelerated, with the places they explored extending from the outskirts of the city to some mysterious caves in the wilderness, which were difficult to design for ordinary people.

Azeroth's grandeur and vastness also gradually unfolded before the eyes of the people, as these adventurers bravely explored and expanded.

The "Spring Tour Observation Team" that charged ordinary leisure players to participate also began to become a hot business for Azeroth.

After the basic demolition of the closed-off area was completed, the foundation of the guild's residence was rebuilt.

Numerous large-scale heavy machinery kept moving back and forth between the city gate and the closed-off residential area.

Players and town residents also gradually got used to the idea that the "Mage Guild" would become a part of their lives.
Here is the translation:

At this time, the players are gradually discovering the allure of "Wang Congwei", the famous figure in the Mistralla player circle. They are all uncertain about why, but it seems that anyone can become friends with her. Even the town's high-ranking officials, who were previously extremely cautious around Zhao Xu, have begun to lower their guard due to Wang Congwei's influence, and the two have started to interact with each other. The "Resist Alliance" that first settled in the town also began to make contact with Wang Congwei. This has allowed Zhao Xu to no longer need to log out of his account "Star Shadow" to suppress others.

This has also piqued Zhao Xu's curiosity about the mysterious powers of "Leadership".

The sound of the construction site's construction drumbeat, which came with the cock's crowing at dawn, has become another alarm clock that wakes people up from their sleep. Moreover, due to the urgent need to speed up construction, the numerous craftsmen summoned have turned this site into another bustling area outside the mine.

Many civilians have come to set up small stalls along the perimeter.

As for Zhao Xu, he has continued to maintain his mysterious demeanor, becoming a sword of intimidation hovering above the town. Except for the few times he has appeared in public after the explosion that occurred after the thieves broke into his room, he has spent most of his time hiding in a temporary wooden tower he built, reading books and enjoying the peaceful scenery of the town.

As for Anniya, her whereabouts are unpredictable, appearing and disappearing at random times, as if she is conducting some kind of investigation. Zhao Xu has seen her a few times, and each time she has been in a hurry.

Sometimes, after pointing out some academic difficulties to Zhao Xu, Anniya would activate higher-level transmission or interdimensional transmission and leave for other places. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu has continued to accumulate his strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

After solidifying his knowledge and skills, he began to feel that the 9th level was not far off. He was waiting for the right opportunity to directly read the fourth "notebook". Suddenly, Zhao Xu discovered that he had flipped to the last page of "Arthas' Simplified Map", and he felt that his geographical skills had become more solid.

He lightly activated his invisible technique, and quietly left the tower. The "eyes" watching from afar had not noticed anything.

After walking through several streets, Zhao Xu finally removed his invisible technique in a shady corner, revealing his original appearance.

However, his entire body was already disguised, and passersby could barely tell that he was a mage, but couldn't be sure if he was indeed Zhong Xia.

Zhao Xu pulled his hat down further to cover his forehead, and began to stroll through the bustling market.

"Come quickly, come quickly! Just caught a very realistic dragon skin material, which can greatly enhance the defensive ability of the armor!"
"From the ancient scroll excavated from the mysterious depths, it seems that you and the noble mage are just one step away from reaching the peak!"
"Double-handed giant sword, innocent and trustworthy, the swordsmith's latest product, limited to three pieces, once it's gone, it's gone forever..."
"Adventurer's set, for sale!"
The loud cries echoed through the streets from head to tail, reminding Zhao Xu of his distant memories.

However, when he was here before, he mainly came to collect taxes from these stalls.

As for him now, he could collect a huge sum of money from taxes every month, thanks to his lordship's authority.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze swept over an old man's stall, and he noticed that the opponent's table was filled with bottles and jars that looked like medicinal liquids.

His curiosity piqued, he quickly walked over.

The term "药水" (yào shuǐ) in itself implies that it's a valuable item.

Players want to enjoy the convenience of magic, and aside from seeking the help of a mage, the only other option is to rely on magical items.

These items include scrolls, rings, strange items, wands, magic wands, authority wands, weapons, armor, and "药水" (yào shuǐ), which represents the remaining channels to enjoy magic.

Among these items, the usage condition of scrolls is the highest, while "药水" is the lowest, requiring only that one can drink it.

Magic potions and divine oil are both one-time consumable items that can reproduce effects of magic spells with a duration of less than one minute and a maximum level of three.

Arthur, who consumes the most, and has the largest quantity, is "治疗药水" (zhì liáo yào shuǐ), a type of healing potion.

However, this traditional online game's "red elixir" in Arthur's eyes is a rather expensive resource.

Even high-end players will only consider drinking a healing potion in times of extreme urgency to urgently recover their health.

For instance, a light-healing potion costs 50 gold coins, while a heavy-healing potion requires 750 gold coins.

At this point, it's not just drinking a potion, but drinking a concentrated liquid made of pure gold.

So Zhao Xu was deeply curious about this ordinary stall selling potions.

However, upon taking a closer look at these bottles, which were clearly not cleaned before being put on display, Zhao Xu realized that they were actually looted grave goods.

"These potions, are they still usable?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.
Here is the translation of the text:

If it's a medicine that's been developed in recent years, then it's obvious that it won't expire even after decades of storage. However, when it comes to medicines that have been buried for hundreds or even thousands of years, it's impossible to predict their effectiveness.

The old man, with a sly smile on his face, said, "It's a small-scale business, and each customer gets what they pay for. No refunds or exchanges." Zhao Xu asked tentatively, "Can I try some?"

Even without using his detection magic or wearing his goggles, Zhao Xu could sense that some of the bottles contained unusual substances. The old man chuckled, as if he had caught his prey, and said, "Of course, you can try some, but you can't taste it."

In reality, it would be safer to just take a sip. However, who knows what consequences would arise from drinking a medicine that's been buried for unknown numbers of years?

Zhao Xu was already confident in his analysis and quietly observed the medicine, putting on his goggles and pretending to analyze the liquid's composition. After a while, Zhao Xu put down the bottle of pale blue medicine and reached for another one with a pure red liquid.

After wasting one of his diagnostic spell slots, Zhao Xu had analyzed the blue medicine and found that it was essentially just a bottle of blue-tinted water.

Zhao Xu carefully observed the shallow red medicine in the glass bottle, which shone brightly in the sunlight. The color was identical to the legendary healing medicine.

Zhao Xu used his diagnostic magic again. However, his expression changed slightly soon after.
Here is the translation of the text:

Due to the conclusion drawn by the law of magic, it is completely consistent with the power of the fake medicine. This is just a useless medicine with no effect.

Zhou Xu, who couldn't help but be curious, directly opened the bottle cap and gently stirred it as if to feel the inner breath. Seeing this scene, the old man also smiled with his teeth, as if very satisfied.

Zhou Xu also smiled.

The bitter almond flavor was the same as the treatment medicine, with the same color, but completely without any effect.

Zhou Xu already understood what had happened, and he immediately took out a copper coin from his pocket, as if to wipe away the dirt on the bottle cap.

Just as the copper coin "dang" flew up and fell back into his palm.

Detection of thoughts!

This two-ring "influence of the heart" prophecy is a magical spell, and Zhou Xu casually performed it.

After three turns, Zhou Xu noticed the old man's superficial thoughts.

As expected.

He unexpectedly encountered a group of swindlers selling fake medicine.

If it's really because it's been too long, the smell or color should also disappear. But it won't be like that, where the taste and color are fine, but it doesn't work.

If adventurers really take this medicine as a lifesaver, they will really be scammed.

At this time, Zhou Xu's face also darkened.

In his previous life, he had led a group selling fake medicine.

But he had previously arrested the entire group, and then they obtained a protection letter from a high-ranking official and walked out of prison with impunity.

At this time, Zhou Xu quietly put down the medicine and shook his head, saying, "These medicines are all fake and useless."
Here is the translation of the text:

The old man's face suddenly turned red with rage as he exclaimed, "Young man, you're not going to buy it even? Fine, but how dare you slander me like this!"

"We Northerners won't take any nonsense and won't stay quiet about it," the old man's voice became more intense.

The surrounding customers and vendors all turned to look.

However, Zhao Xu remained calm and said, "I believe I'm not the first person to see through your fake medicines. But before, the knowledgeable ones would rather not get involved and just walk away when they see it's all fake medicines."

"But I'm different," Zhao Xu smiled mischievously.

Just then, two burly men appeared behind Zhao Xu, looking menacing.

"What's going on?"

At this point, two law enforcement officers who maintained order in the area walked over, one of whom had a piece of grass in the corner of his mouth and looked bored.

The old man who sold fake medicines took the opportunity to recount what had just happened.

As the crowd watched, they began to understand what was going on.

"This medicine, it's not very convincing," said the head of the patrol team with a smile.

"This is simple, just take a sip and you can try it out," Zhao Xu stated confidently.

"How so?" the patrol team member turned to look at the old man.

Unbeknownst to the old man, he was trembling with rage and said, "I sell only genuine medicines passed down through my family, and I won't let this outsider tarnish our family's honor. I agree to your proposal, but I request that the team leader verify it."

"However, if everyone has to taste a small amount to verify it, I won't be able to bear the loss of my medicines."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also came to the point, "As long as it's true, there's a bottle of what I bought one bottle here."
"Good," the old man smiled, with a satisfied expression on his face.

He began to examine Zhao Xu's whole outfit, as if pondering something.

At the same time, he handed over the blue-colored medicine water that Zhao Xu had just observed, deliberately covering the label on the bottle: "Sir, this is the fake medicine water he said. To avoid your psychological suggestion, you take a sip first and then talk."

The patrol officer looked puzzled, but still nodded, and then took a sip under the old man's assistance.

Suddenly, the patrol officer's face changed, "I feel like my strength has increased slightly."
The old man smiled with satisfaction and released his grasp on the bottle cap.

The audience around them looked at Zhao Xu with evil eyes.

In reality, from the moment the word "outsider" came out, Zhao Xu became aware of the existence of the "script".

When this scene was completely performed in front of him, Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head and laugh.

"This is what you said, there's a bottle of true medicine here, you can buy one bottle," the old man with yellow teeth smiled, "The bottle in my hand is already 300 gold coins, this price is the standard price."

At this moment, Zhao Xu seemed like a young man who couldn't believe what was happening before his eyes. He casually took the blue-colored bottle from the opponent and carefully examined the composition of the medicine water inside.

Then, he lightly "tapped" the bottle body, making it sway.

"Young man, I'll bet you can't beat me, this is how we people from the north do things."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's okay. Even if I have to take on multiple years of debt for this, I won't hesitate."

"If you're a coward, then don't start bragging from the beginning."

The people around him looked at his actions, unable to hold back their mockery.

However, Zhao Xu took out three coupons from his pocket and said, "These are commercial coupons endorsed by the Goddess of Commerce, each worth 100 gold coins, exactly matching the 300 gold coins price of this bottle of 'Bull Strength' medicine."

The old man's eyes lit up as he took the coupons and examined them before realizing they were genuine.

However, he still refused to give up and said, "You just said there's a real one here, and you're buying one bottle."

But Zhao Xu just smiled and said, "Don't rush."

He then lightly waved his hand in a mysterious gesture and chanted a seemingly simple incantation.

This action, which looked ordinary, seemed to make the onlookers nervous.

Especially when the last faint light appeared on Zhao Xu's palm and then disappeared into the medicine.

"I just used the 'Transmutation of Medicine' spell, which can convert magical medicine into explosive materials, usable as explosive remote ammunition."

"The blast radius is 3 meters, causing 2-12 points of damage, enough to injure civilians who get caught in the blast."

As Zhao Xu finished speaking, he relaxed his hand, and the bottle of medicine fell to the ground with a "pop."

The old man's face turned pale as he stared at the scene in shock.

However, nothing happened.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was amusedly looking at the old man and the patrol officers with stiff faces.
Here is the translation:

"Originally, when I saw this scene, I felt like if I were a stranger, I would be so helpless."

"But who says Arthur can just change the script of the world as a strong one?"

"I still quite like this point."

"Now it's your turn to explain it to me."
