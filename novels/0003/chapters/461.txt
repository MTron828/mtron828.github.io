Chapter 462: Heading to the Capital

As White Dragon Serus recounted his experience in the temple, Zhao Xuan felt a buzzing sound in his ears, making it impossible for him to focus on what Serus was saying.

Black Dragon! Tiama!

Zhao Xuan had doubted many times why they, a small town in the cold and snowy north, would encounter a black dragon that liked to live in warm and swampy areas.

After that, the black dragon seemed to have vanished without a trace, and they couldn't find any trace of it until they received a message again that the black dragon had reappeared in "Fallen Star Town".

With the help of the Earth's strong warriors from the Northern Alliance, they finally pinpointed the new lair of the black dragon.

At that time, they formed a team of around 50 people, known as the "Dragon Slaying Team". As a 5-level warrior, Zhao Xuan was considered average, belonging to the lower level of the team.

Initially, the team leader, Feng Xun, looked at Zhao Xuan with a mixture of annoyance and disgust, but he didn't dare to refuse him, so he brought Zhao Xuan along for this dragon-slaying battle.

From the time they received the message to the team being ambushed by the dragon, it took less than a week.

Throughout the process, Zhao Xuan was in a state of excitement and anticipation, feeling a sense of revenge and satisfaction after years of grudge.

It's worth noting that many Earth players in the Northern Alliance have become a force to be reckoned with over the past decade, and under the leadership of Wang Qingwei, the Earth's remaining forces have grown and developed after experiencing the Seal of Magic War, becoming an important force on the continent of Arthur.

The players of Winter City's game gathered to slay a black dragon, which was no easy feat. They had been searching for it for nine years, but even with the help of mages, they couldn't find its trail. The dragon seemed to have emerged from a stone, and it killed people without any mercy. After killing, it would hide for years. Therefore, the survivors, including Zhao Xu, were trapped in a state of helplessness, unable to take revenge with their lives.

After crossing over, Zhao Xu realized that he couldn't bring his past experiences into the present or use prophecy magic to find the dragon. He had to wait for the day of the past attack to find the dragon again. During his time at Mistral, Zhao Xu kept this matter hidden in his heart, not thinking about it intentionally.

In the past, Zhao Xu had been waiting for seven years for news. In this life, he had to wait for three more years, which was not an obstacle for him. However, at the moment when White Dragon Serus connected the "black dragon" and "Tyamatus", it seemed that the mysterious appearance and disappearance of the black dragon over the past seven years were all explained.

Perhaps Zhao Xu had participated in the legendary campaign to surround and kill the demigod "Tyamatus" in its black dragon form. Originally, he thought that slaying the black dragon was an easy task for him. However, in the instant he suspected the truth, Zhao Xu's calm heart suddenly ignited with passion again.
Here is the translation of the text:

If this is all true, then he would have to pay the price to the god of evil, Tyamata.

Zhao Xu's originally relaxed fists tightened involuntarily.

This caused Serus, who was secretly observing the three people's posture, to feel a sudden sense of unease, not knowing where he had gone wrong, and inadvertently triggered the young man's appetite.

Suddenly, the wind around them grew stronger, mixed with flying snow, and seemed to be howling like a storm eye.

Like a bag of freshly shoveled snow suddenly unwinding its rope and falling directly onto the ground, it made it difficult for several people to open their eyes.

However, the white dragon Serus remained motionless, not daring to move.

Escape, death.

Don't run, be enslaved.

As he thought, the dragon that lived was still a good dragon, while the dead dragon was nothing but a skeleton.

"This is it," said Annyoja, breaking the silence. "To redeem your sins, you will now serve as Vivian's mount from now on."

As she spoke, she pointed to the nearby sword-wielding demon knight standing beside her, who also nodded lightly at the white dragon.

For her, turning an evil white dragon into a benevolent one that could help the elderly and children was a greater achievement.

"Time?" the white dragon Serus opened his mouth, unconsciously revealing that he had accepted this proposal.

However, his mind was already calculating the odds of deceiving the demon knight, who would certainly be long gone by the time he became a 400-year-old old dragon in his eighth stage of life.

The great white dragon Serus estimated that he would not be able to report this humiliation, so he would have to redirect his anger and educate the descendants of the demon knight's daughter.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it time?" Anniya Nori raised her chin and thought deeply with a low brow.

"Alright, after Zhongxia completes his mission in the capital, he will return to the town to take up the post of director of the Earth Methodist Association and participate in the construction of the association's engineering projects. At that time, you can participate in building the building as well, even though you may not have any magical abilities like transforming rocks into mud. You can just be a carrier for transporting earth."

At this moment, Serus the White Dragon listened as if he had become a "transportation creature" used for carrying heavy loads and didn't dare to speak up, only able to swallow his words and nod his head.

"This esteemed master, can I leave once the building is completed?"

"Yes?"

Anniya Nori stretched out her voice and said, "Almost, Zhongxia will organize a team to explore that Tiama's 'Temple' later, and you can lead the team there."

At this moment, Serus the White Dragon was also stunned.

He thought he had barely escaped death.

He had to work hard to finish his sentence, and now he was about to die.

Really, dragons are not afraid to die, but Serus the White Dragon shouted loudly on the spot: "I accept!"

"Not bad, you're a very perceptive white dragon, it seems you have some cultivation value."

Anniya Nori waved her arm with a satisfied expression, starting to chant incantations and perform hand gestures to cast a spell.

Anniya Nori had previously cast several nine-ring spells, and it was only a brief pause between breaths. Seeing her seriously prepared to cast a spell, Zhao Xu also carefully observed her spellcasting process.

And Serus the White Dragon watched the mystical woman's movements with great anticipation, wondering if she would release a permanent strengthening spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Is this the legendary strategy of giving a dragon a gift and then a date?

The wise and intelligent white dragon, Serus, couldn't help but analyze the specific benefits, and his inner expectations were constantly rising.

At the moment when Anzhiya stopped speaking, only to see the light of the spell transform into a seven-colored, silky thread that continuously wrapped around the white dragon's body, rotating around it, and eventually merging into the dragon's scales.

"Alright," Anzhiya said, looking at her masterpiece, satisfied with a nod, "I've cast a death curse on this white dragon. If it disobeys your orders, you can use the dragon language to chant my name as the trigger command, and it will die on the spot."

"Then it will turn into a skeleton dragon."

As Anzhiya said this, she couldn't help but feel proud and nodded her head, "I never thought that this legendary spell, 'Dragon Death Slave,' would actually be useful one day."

As the leader of the alliance, Tang De, and the giant of the Frosty Mountains, Frey, who had seen it all, looked at the four people in front of him with utmost astonishment.

His three saviors, who had just gone to chase the white dragon that had sent the winter wolves to attack them, were now returning with an extra person?

However, Frey didn't dwell on this for long and immediately approached Zhao Xu with a smile, thanking them one by one for their recent assistance.

Noticing that Zhao Xu wore no cotton clothing at all, Frey directly took off his own woolen cloak and was about to put it on Zhao Xu to keep him warm, but Zhao Xu politely declined.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the white dragon "Syrus" who had transformed into a middle-aged man's appearance, stood beside him, looking bored and worn out, his face expressing a bitter taste of life.

"I don't know what our benefactor has planned next," he said. "Although my abilities are weak, I do have some connections in the capital, and even the general forces will give me some face."

Frell spoke with confidence, but his tone was polite, not at all arrogant, despite having just been rescued and the city's aid was arriving slowly. "We do have something important to discuss regarding the alliance with Orol."

At this, Frrell and the guards behind him couldn't help but smile, and even the sorrowful emotions that had been suppressed by the recently deceased brothers began to fade away.

Frell thought to himself that as long as the mysterious mage in front of him was willing to speak, he, Frrell, could confidently take care of the matter. Even if the other party wanted to join the official forces of the Association, he could use his connections to help facilitate introductions to the high-ranking officials of the Northern Alliance branch.

"That would be great," he said.

Zhao Xuan smiled warmly, "I was planning to visit the Northern Alliance branch of the Association."

Frell nodded immediately, although the fireballs in front of him looked formidable, but it was not an easy task for an outsider to meet with the high-ranking officials of the association. He had seen several failed attempts by mages before. He quickly thought of a few names he had previously interacted with, and he could ask the secretary to make an appointment for him to meet with them. He was confident that he would not delay his benefactor's plans for more than three days.
Before he could even start speaking, Zhao Xu went on to say, "This is about preparing for the Starfall Town Mage Association branch. In the next summer, I will take office as the chairman of the Starfall Town Mage Association branch."

"...…"
Suddenly, everyone in the scene was as silent as a grave. Even the group of city guards who had come to rescue, were now just staring blankly at Zhao Xu and the others.
