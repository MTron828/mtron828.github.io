Chapter 231: Illumination Class

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, Fu Lei was about to realize that the other person was her bodyguard, and even shout out her father's name. Otherwise, she would have suspected the other person's intentions.

However, this was not a problem, as she had grown up following a female thief and had learned how to use her beauty to her advantage without losing.

"Can I go back at night?" Fu Lei whispered.

"Yes, you can."

From then on, the journey was like what Zhao Xu had experienced before. A group of people traveled together at night, with Zhang Qi and others taking out simple torches made of wood and cloth.

This torch was basically a wooden stick with a shape carved out and wrapped with a cloth soaked in oil, which could be bought for one copper coin on the market. However, the brightness of this torch was general, and the thick smoke it produced also affected the holder's feelings.

On the other hand, it was easy to extinguish or set the surrounding grass on fire, which could cause burns. Therefore, once adventurers had the money, they would replace this torch with a lamp.

Moreover, the oil limit of this torch was limited, and it could only last for one hour.

As a graduate of Winter City's first law school, the player Law Master Mu Tian took out a cow's eye lantern.

This lantern had undergone processing and had a small opening on the inside. After lighting the lamp oil, it could emit a conical illumination area of 20 meters through the cow's eye. The oil seal was another supplement to the illuminating effect.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Huh, Wood Elm, how much does this lantern cost?" asked the mage player from Zhao Xu's class.

"Twelve gold coins," replied the mage Wood Elm. "It's because it takes about six hours to burn a small lamp oil, and it costs around one silver coin."

When people heard this, they suddenly became interested. "It's just that it provides a wider illumination range, allowing us to see the dark area earlier, which is better," Wood Elm explained with a smile.

"Anyway, it's always worth it," the barbarian profession's Dou Nan said with a laugh, proudly surveying the surrounding wilderness at night.

The half-orc species has the ability of dark vision, and they can also gain two points of strength enhancement.

"If you have a torch, use it. If you have dark vision, use it. This road is where players who die every day, so be careful," Zhang Qi shouted loudly.

Zhao Xu looked at Dou Nan with a headache.

Dou Nan had registered two accounts in his previous life and had always played as a half-orc species with a barbarian profession. It was also suitable for his personality, as he would suddenly go into a rage and increase his attributes.

However, this species is not very suitable for now, as players have no idea what to do.

When Dou Nan thought about getting married and having children, he would have to find a half-orc.

Although Dou Nan himself didn't care much about it.

In reality, people who give themselves a game ID like this usually don't care about it.

However, Dou Nan really wanted to be human, and Zhao Xu had a way to help him.
This is also the reason why magicians and priests become increasingly helpless after reaching a high level. Because most of the problems that exist in time have already been solved by previous generations using corresponding spells. At least Du Nan is now enjoying the benefits brought by the half-orc race, such as dark vision, which allows them to see in the dark without torches and to see the darkness ahead. They only struggle when encountering darkness caused by magic. And Frey probably also wants a little more illumination for added safety. At this point, she took out an alchemical item from her package - the "Illumination Staff." Then, after tapping the top of the staff lightly, it emitted a soft light like a glowing magic wand. It provided enough dim visibility even in areas exceeding the range of torch illumination, from 10 to 20 meters away. "Wow, someone actually bought this thing," exclaimed a player who noticed what Frey was holding. The Illumination Staff is a slender iron rod with a gold-plated top. Once tapped, it consumes the gold layer and emits light until the gold is used up, at which point the light stops. A small Illumination Staff, providing 6 hours of illumination, sells for 2 gold coins, which is indeed not something an ordinary person would use. Although it is more convenient and less likely to cause a fire compared to torches and lanterns. Zhao Xu didn't expect that just a lighting tool could reveal the status of the people present. Thinking back to his past life, he could only use a torch while watching other players use lanterns. As he thought about it, he also took out his "Everlasting Torch."
When he took it out, several pairs of eyes immediately glanced over, but since everyone saw that he was also taking out a torch, they didn't pay much attention.

"Honey," suddenly Feng Ge said softly to Zhang Qi, "that priest's torch is strange."

"What's strange about it?" Zhang Qi was a bit puzzled.

Feng Ge lowered his voice and said, "He didn't light it, it's already lit when he took it out."

At this point, Zhang Qi couldn't help but feel a tingling sensation in his back.

If things are abnormal, then half of them have special problems.

He said to Feng Ge in a low voice, "Go and inform Lulu, I'll go see what's going on."

After handing the torch back to Feng Ge, he walked lightly towards Zhao Xu.

According to their plan, they still had to walk for another two hours before setting up camp.

When Zhang Qi got closer and looked at the torch in Zhao Xu's hand, he didn't feel anything strange, the flame was still burning.

It wasn't until he stopped for a while that he realized the torch wasn't hot.

He couldn't help but walk over and ask in a low voice, "Brother Priest, why does your torch look different from ours?"

Zhao Xu smiled slightly, "Many of the lighting in the temple are actually like this."

Hearing this reply, Zhang Qi was a bit confused, as he had never been to a temple.

But he didn't expect that Zhao Xu's listening skills were too advanced, and he couldn't hide anything from him.

After Zhao Xu noticed that Feng Ge's topic was related to him through his high-level listening skills, he started paying attention.

So even if Feng Ge's voice was low, under Zhao Xu's listening skills of level 30 or above, it was basically the same as if he was speaking right next to his ear.

He didn't even need to use "Sharp Ear Technique" as a spy spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had naturally heard Feng Ge's question, so he answered Zhang Qi, and also told Feng Ge - there are many such fire torches in the temple, but they only exist as lanterns. As a pastor who relies on intuition, it's easy for him to stagnate without observing his surroundings thoroughly.

At this time, Zhang Qi had already returned to his original position, and Feng Ge had also returned from Cui Lu's side, biting his ear and saying, "Embarrassing, that fire torch is the non-extinguishing fire torch, worth 110 gold coins."

"I'm going, you're saying the non-extinguishing fire torch is worth 110 gold coins?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but shout out loud.

He was shocked by it.

He had spent a lot of money to buy the "board armor" similar to Zhao Xu's the day before, which provided 6 layers of armor defense and only cost 200 gold coins.

Is it really worth 110 gold coins? This is not worth it, so why not solve the equipment problem first?

Zhao Xu looked at Zhang Qi, who had shouted out, and many players in the scene turned to look at him, clearly reacting to the fire torch that Zhang Qi had mentioned, which was the one in Zhao Xu's hand?

110 gold coins?

Isn't it said that it's not worth it? So why not buy this thing and solve the equipment problem first?

Zhao Xu looked at everyone's attention and explained, "This non-extinguishing fire torch is made by adding the 'non-extinguishing enlightenment' spell to it, so the torch can emit light forever without heat."

"Is it really 110 gold coins?" Zhang Qi asked with a hint of doubt.

Zhao Xu shook his head slightly, "Not that much, the material cost is just 50 gold coins of red gemstone powder."

"I'm going, isn't it making a 60 gold coin profit by buying this on the market?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but continue to shout out loud.

He still wore the board armor on his body, which was earned by Feng Ge's pastor ability.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At this moment, Pastor Feng Ge was helpless and nudged Zhang Qi's shoulder, indicating him to shut up.

"You can find a mage to cast a two-ring spell, and the service fee is 60 gold coins," he said.

The two-ring spell has a base cost of 20 gold coins, and when multiplied by the 3rd-level mage's level, it becomes 60 gold coins.

This is also the reason why the nine-ring spell requires a service fee of 90*17=1530 gold coins.

The nearby crowd also heard Pastor Feng Ge's words and couldn't help but gaze at Zhao Xu's torch in his hand.

Spend thousands of gold coins to buy a powerful armor, and they won't feel extravagant.

However, a seemingly insignificant light can cost hundreds of gold coins, which is really astonishing.

" Xiao Ge, suddenly I feel that mages who cast spells for others can also make a fortune," Zhang Qi couldn't help but envy.

Pastor Feng Ge then explained, "The divine magic of the clergy is all derived from God. Don't think about it, we can't collect service fees like mages, we have to serve the faithful."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's classmates also couldn't help but look at the copper coin torch in their hand, and then glance at the silver coin lantern that could be used once.

Then they looked at the illumination rod in Feng Li's hand, and immediately their gaze returned to the torch in Zhao Xu's hand.

At what point, playing with lighting, everyone could see the stark class divisions.

Originally, Zhao Xu was about to comfort everyone, but suddenly he stopped in his tracks.

He had a puzzled expression and turned his head, looking at the pile of rocks in the distance.

The ghost that had been buried in the depths of the Star Lake, had it appeared ahead of time?

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu was no longer the same as he was during his first adventure.

No matter who came, Zhao Xu's current abilities had not yet reached that level.
