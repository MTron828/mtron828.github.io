Chapter 60: Mysterious Reward
As soon as Zhao Xu heard An'tinoja's response, he was taken aback and had a glimpse of the mischievous smile under her hood. However, considering her legendary mage identity, it was almost impossible for Zhao Xu to even approach An'tinoja with malicious intentions, let alone lift up her hood. He didn't dare to speculate about the buffs she had on her body.

Zhao Xu had experienced high-level mages in his past life and had a deep understanding of the situation. Even a 5th-level mage could take the battle to another dimension. However, Zhao Xu was humble and asked An'tinoja to teach him.

A year later, people who wanted to learn from a legendary mage like An'tinoja lined up from the church to the gates of Mistral City, but Zhao Xu was one of the few who had the opportunity to learn from her.

"Teacher, I've heard of the 'Constant Spell' spell, but isn't there a price to pay?" Zhao Xu asked softly, being humble and modest.

The 5th-level spell "Magic Constant" allowed Zhao Xu to know that it could stabilize 10-15 common spells. However, he had also heard that the price of the spell was that it consumed one's profession ability and two spell slots.

When An'tinoja said this, Zhao Xu's teeth almost dropped, and he found it too ridiculous. Using the spell that recovered profession ability and spell slots daily was what he considered a price? He was already consuming his lifespan every day.

He had to prepare the corresponding magical tools, such as "transparent crystal", to cast the "reading magic". Before casting the spell, he had to take out the tools from the side pocket of his backpack and then put them back in after releasing the magic. This was thanks to the "Howard convenience bag" given to him by Anziniya, which allowed him to retrieve whatever he wanted from another dimension.

Without such equipment, mages had to wear an outer robe with countless inner pockets to store their magic materials, making them look like beggar wizards to those who didn't know. Zhao Xiu was almost drooling at the thought of having such a convenient spell.

However, as a disciple of Anziniya and not her son, he couldn't ask for too much. "The second point is that your estimated time for casting the 'reading magic' is quite off. This is a huge taboo in the world of magic."

Zhao Xiu nodded, knowing that the level of a mage determined the power, duration, and effects of a spell. Guessing incorrectly would lead to vastly different conclusions.

Anziniya mentioned that even 40-level mages, such as the legendary magic goddesses, had appeared only a few times.

"8 hours?" Zhao Xiu reacted quickly, guessing that it would take that long.

If he combined the "spell duration" with a higher-level spell, he could increase the duration by one fold.

"You know nothing about the strength of a mage," Anziniya said.

Zhao Xiu almost didn't react, wondering what Anziniya meant by such a cheesy line.

"If you combine 'spell persistence', you can make the spell last for a whole day, even if the target is at a non-natural distance," Anziniya said calmly.

When he heard this, Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

But he suddenly widened his eyes in disbelief, looking at An Ti Nuo Ya in shock, and whispered softly: "Isn't that impossible?"

"Ha, do I need to deceive you?"

As it turned out, the mage was really strong here!

The "Reading Magic" spell that lasts for 10 minutes, with each level of spellcasting, doesn't have much strategic significance, as it's a 10-minute spell.

However, there are some spells that last for as long as the caster's level, and some that only last for one turn, which are extremely powerful spells, so the duration is short.

Once these spells can last all day, the mage is really capable of outputting more damage than a warrior.

Moreover, such a mage, due to the spell's constant presence, no longer needs to rush to buff themselves in the heat of battle.

When Zhao Xu saw this mage, the other party was already in the peak state of battle readiness.

An Ti Nuo Ya was looking at Zhao Xu's shocked expression with a calm tone, knowing that he had already reacted to it.

However, An Ti Nuo Ya didn't intend to tell Zhao Xu that this was just one aspect of the mage's strength.

The mage's true strength lies elsewhere.

"That's a big price to pay," Zhao Xu said, his expression returning to clarity. He was clear that this was the path he had been striving for.

It was mentioned very little in the previous forum, and it seemed that few players in the community had mastered this skill.

If he combined this skill with the "Spell Delay" specialization, the mage's power was something Zhao Xu couldn't even imagine.

"The premise is that you have mastered the 'Spell Delay' specialization, which is also the reason for choosing a domain to focus on."

"Ah, the price to pay is simply a matter of preparing with a sixth-level spell," said Anniya as if the price were nothing.

Hearing these words, Zhao Xu suddenly felt like he was waking up from a dream.

He felt like Anniya was teasing him.

Sixth-level? What does that mean?

This means that Zhao Xu's "reading magic" needs to use a sixth-level spell to prepare for this zero-level spell.

A sixth-level spell is something only a level 11 mage can possess.

Even if he reaches level 17, he can only use a third-level spell to maintain a ninth-level spell.

The significance has already lost its strategic value.

"Take it easy, our progress as mages can compress this price. Otherwise, how can I maintain a ninth-level spell like 'The Master of the Underground' on my body?"

"Good luck, as long as you study hard, we will give you that kind of progress."

Anniya's words left Zhao Xu stunned.

He took a deep breath, knowing his mind was already in chaos.

He felt like he was back in his childhood, using various cheats to play games.

Zhao Xu could only constantly mutter incantations, using his habitual focus to suppress the sense of turmoil.

"That's fine, you can keep guessing. How long does my 'reading magic' last?"

"Yesterday, you guessed correctly, and I promised you a reward. I brought it with me, wrapped in this blue cloth. If you guess correctly now, the reward can be upgraded to something wrapped in green cloth. However, we've reached this point, and there's a price to pay. If you guess incorrectly, I'll take back the reward in the blue cloth."
Zhao Xu gazed at the two packages on the table, one blue and one green, each small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. However, he had not received everything he expected. He had only upgraded to a green-wrapped package, not the entire thing.

He wondered if his guess was correct or not. "How can I tell if it's correct or not?" he asked.

"I think it is correct. I think it's not. Even if it's off by one turn, it's still a mistake," someone replied.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu's expression turned calm.

An Ni Nuoya was indeed what he wanted to bet on - whether it was 24 hours.

However, it was actually very easy to guess.

If he used "Perpetual Magic," it would be a standard 24 hours.

If he used "Time Extension" to double the time, the caster would need to be over level 72, and the magic would need to last more than 24 hours.

How could An Ni Nuoya possibly have a caster of that level? Even the Magic Goddess wouldn't be able to do it.

After a moment of silence, Zhao Xu spoke directly - "Over 24 hours."
