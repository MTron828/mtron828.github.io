Chapter 42: Farewell to a Familiar Person

Zhao Xu didn't expect that in this competition arena, there was another mage hiding. The male mage's appearance was not particularly impressive, with a face that seemed to be around 30 years old and with Eastern features.

However, Zhao Xu's attention was focused on the other party, who seemed to be behaving strangely. Zhao Xu was still feeling a bit stunned from the previous situation.

He didn't expect that he had actually used two spells in a row without a moment's rest.

"Hey, I haven't transferred it to you yet, what's it to you?" Anniya, the goddess, frowned at the young mage.

"Hey, I'll get it from you later in the summer, but can you explain it to me first?" the mage replied.

"Why can he use the 'Instant Release' spell to cast the 'Frost Ray' spell?"

"Moreover, the specialized application of the spell is impossible to learn, so he should not have been able to use the 'Instant Release' spell in the first place."

"Furthermore, I've calculated that his spell slot should be exhausted by now."

The mage looked very impatient and asked several questions in a row.

"It's rare to see someone like you," Anniya said sarcastically, "who can't even understand the application of our innate abilities, let alone legendary ones."

However, the mage didn't seem to be the slightest bit embarrassed.

He turned his head to look at Zhao Xu and asked again, "I'm bringing my student, I need to understand the situation. Can you tell me about it? Your innate abilities are not limited to simply recovering spell slots, are they?"

"That's possible. However, Anniya, the information involves a secret. If you leak it out, you'll be responsible for the consequences."

Anniya looked at the opponent with a hint of annoyance.

At this moment, Rayan, the law wizard, became even more curious than Zhao Xu, like a beginner. He nodded hastily, "I understand, I understand. You can rest assured, after satisfying my curiosity, I will delete the memory."

After finishing his sentence, Rayan hurried towards Anniya, walking all the way to within three meters. At the same time, he also waved at Zhao Xu, gesturing for him to come over. Zhao Xu walked over with a bewildered expression, reaching within three meters of Rayan.

Rayan's expression suddenly changed, and he began to chant an incantation.

The incantation was short and ended abruptly, before Zhao Xu could take another breath. A translucent, glowing ball appeared around them, with a seven-colored, iridescent sheen, like a very inflated bubble.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu took a deep breath, and memories from his past life flooded back.

He looked at Rayan in surprise and asked, "Rainbow sphere?"

"Don't be so presumptuous, you're just a beginner, and you're already trying to understand these nine-level spells?" Rayan replied with a smile.

The nine-level spells, including the Rainbow Sphere, were renowned in the player community. The spell was unbreakable, like a turtle shell.

But what did they need to reach this level? Rayan immediately understood that Zhao Xu didn't know why he was releasing the spell.

Rayan smiled and said, "It seems you're just half-baked. All the conditions inside the Rainbow Sphere are impossible to detect, track, or predict."

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow, realizing that it was a secret, but the cost was too high.

In his past life, he had never seen many high-level spells. This time, the game had started, and he was already experiencing a series of high-level spells.

As for the gap in magical prowess, it's like a drought or a flood. Seeing Lei'an complete this magic, Annethnoja's mouth suddenly opened, saying, "The potential points can simulate super magical expertise."

"He used one potential point to restore a magic slot. He used one to simulate the Instant Magic specialty, and then used three potential points to reduce the magic slot from level 4 to level 1."

Lei'an heard this and almost widened his eyes, saying, "You owners of potential points are too tyrannical! Not only can you have unlimited magic slots, but you can also simulate unlimited super magical expertise? You've got all the benefits under the heavens!"

"Don't you dare?" Annethnoja replied coldly.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also felt that Annethnoja had a cold and unfriendly attitude towards him, whether it was in front of the old mage Morcal or the young mage Lei'an.

She showed no warmth or friendliness, as if she had never interacted with him before.

"That's not it, he really is, to hand over the task, at least let me know the details," Lei'an said, complaining.

"Can this kid be entrusted to you?"

At this moment, the transparent barrier of the rainbow-colored magic sphere that had been set up around them began to dissipate.

"Yes, Zhongxiao, your preliminary mage course has come to an end, and you will follow Lei'an from now on."

"He is our and the temple's liaison officer, and he will take you to your duty as a priest. And your potential points are now exhausted, don't worry about it, there will be more in the future."

Zhao Xu's body suddenly stiffened, and he hastily asked, "Teacher, are you no longer going to guide me?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"You've beaten up a few old men at the neighboring temple, so the relationship isn't very good. So, I'll take you to the temple to work as a pastor, and then we'll come back," Lei An said.

An Ning Yao didn't explain much, gave Lei An a piercing look, and then directly disappeared.

Zhao Xu knew that they would meet again in the future, and he felt a sense of detachment as a child of the Jianghu.

As An Ning Yao disappeared, Lei An turned around, looked at Zhao Xu with a serious expression, and asked, "Let me introduce myself first."

"My name is Lei An, a 20th-level mage. As a first-class identity, I am the liaison officer of the Magic Goddess Temple of the Arthurian Mage Association. As a second-class identity, I am also a liaison officer of the Final Scroll."

Listening to Lei An's words, Zhao Xu nodded slightly. An Ning Yao didn't say anything and handed him over to Lei An.

Actually, there was only one sentence that was left unsaid, which could be inferred by the other party.

"'Zhong Xia, 1st-level mage, double elite, member of the Arthurian Mage Association, and member of the Final Scroll."
"Yes, hello, Zhong Xia, let's clarify your current progress first," Lei An said, looking at Zhao Xu.

"Next, the organization will arrange for you to go to the temple to work as a pastor. Your mage course is actually lacking in weapon proficiency and skills. These skills are also included in the pastor's training, especially in the mastery of pastor's weapons and armor, and skills will be arranged later."

"Do you have any questions about your future progress?"

Zhao Xu shook his head, "No."

"However, Mr. Lei An, I have a question."

"What is it?"

"The battle just now, was it set up for what reason?"

Lei An raised an eyebrow, and his usual carefree expression turned serious.

"It's just a little exercise, isn't it?"

"I think it's not that simple," Zhao Xu persisted.
Here is the translation:

"Good, but you have to keep this a secret, okay?" Lei An looked around with various probes surrounding him.

He relied solely on his naked eye to survey the surroundings, as if he had forgotten he was a mage.

"This secret is also what led me to become the leader of the organization, ah, forget it, to avoid you exposing me. In fact, only the middle-level members know. We will eventually execute this ritual, and all the battle forces will participate."

"Mainly to let you know that high-level mages have many more ways to kill you. So, when you encounter a high-level mage, the farther you run, the better. Go back and call someone higher-ranking than him to beat him up."

Note: Lei An is likely a character in a fantasy story, and the context is a conversation between him and someone else, possibly a novice mage.
