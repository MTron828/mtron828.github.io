Chapter 343: Crossing

The voice that was right in front of him, now sounded distant and wavering. It had a natural magical power that emitted an irresistible charm, capable of unwrapping the film-like membrane on the tip of one's heart.

Zhao Xu had his eyes closed, unable to directly gaze at the god. However, it was as if he had truly witnessed the divine, filling him with a sense of tears welling up in his eyes, as if the scene above him was the most moving scene in his life, prompting a feeling of awe and reverence.

All the memories of warmth and sweetness from his past life, which had been sealed away for many years, were suddenly recalled, flooding his mind and body, and constantly stirring his suppressed emotions.

His emotions burst forth from within.

Zhao Xu finally understood.

The divine charm was truly terrifying to what extent.

If he hadn't previously touched the unscaled gods in the River of Time, and "seen" the third-generation magic goddess of the mortal world, and if he hadn't just touched the demon king Glazet, and if the goddess before him had descended through him, he would have been completely assimilated into a devout priestess.

After calming his inner turmoil for a long time, Zhao Xu slowly opened his mouth and said, "Just two months, soon."

"For you, it's just two months. But for us, it's a history that spans a thousand years."

Sisylveina sighed, her voice like a gentle whisper in Zhao Xu's ear.

Zhao Xu immediately understood the meaning of the goddess's words.
Here is the translation of the text:

For him, the two months that had passed were almost nothing, but to Silvina, it was a period that could be traced back to before she became a goddess. He had once mistaken the goddess in front of him for a demon and had fiercely resisted her approach, feeling embarrassed.

It was likely that the goddess had intentionally appeared in the same outfit as she had back then, implying that she was making fun of him. However, he also noticed that Silvina's tone and attitude towards him were slightly different from what they had been before she became a goddess.

The Silvina from back then might not have recognized him. Zhao Xu's heart was tangled with a thousand threads, and he didn't know where to start.

Before him was Arthur, who was currently the strongest mage and one of the most powerful gods. "Don't worry, Gralz, after I intervene, at least he won't touch your mind," Silvina explained.

Zhao Xu was also a bit confused. As the three generations of goddesses, they had been carrying on the history of magic and had more accurate records than the Church. Compared to the first and second generations of goddesses, the current third-generation goddess was even more distant and aloof, not even responding to major events of the Church.

Therefore, Silvina's explanation to Zhao Xu was quite detailed.

"That's why she sent a demon and intercepted me?" Zhao Xu asked in time.

"Ahah."

Suddenly, the goddess laughed with a clear and melodious laugh, and the air seemed to be filled with a fragrance that was pleasing to the heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's just about some small details, barely understood, half-recognized, and unable to achieve great things."

When the goddess evaluated Glazet, a powerful force in the abyss, as "unable to achieve great things", Zhao Xu remained silent.

Although he was also curious, he wondered what level of immortal achievement would make him worthy in the goddess's eyes, who considered it a "great thing".

"You just let what happened to you today with Glazet go, and don't try to retaliate. I'll send you a divine decree later."

Sisylvina's tone was gentle, like a gentle brook flowing into people's hearts.

Zhao Xu didn't even nod slightly, as he had never thought of retaliation. It was already futile.

For countless people, not being remembered by the abyss and hell was already a great fortune.

"By the way, how do you plan to leave this world? Just execute your next orders now. You'll be back in Mistral tomorrow."

"Your Highness, is that so?" Zhao Xu asked, having already activated the "logout" option.

However, there was no response this time.

For a full minute, the air was silent, with only the sweet fragrance seeping into Zhao Xu's breathing.

Until the last second, just as Zhao Xu's body was about to leave the space.

He suddenly heard the goddess's whispered words.

"Zhong Xia, be careful of Asmodiels."

...Zhao Xu didn't come back to his senses until he removed his helmet.
Here is the translation of the text:

He couldn't react in time, and to his surprise, the magical goddess Sylvia, instead of giving him advice about the demon king "Grazzit", was actually talking about the highest ruler of the entire underworld, "Asmorthys". Compared to the infinitely complex and layered abyss, occupying just one layer is enough to raise the flag and become the "Abyssal King", also known as the ruler of the abyss. However, most strong individuals can only occupy one layer.

Even the spider goddess, who possesses great divine power, occupies only one layer of the underworld. For the underworld, which is governed by order, the nine layers are clearly defined, and occupying other layers means being under the control of Asmorthys, with the title of "Underworld Lord" being equivalent to a military position.

Only Asmorthys, the ruler of the nine-layer underworld, dominates everything in the underworld, and it is one of the few immortal existences that has existed since the ancient elemental gods. It has witnessed the evolution of divine history, and the records of its existence are sparse and fragmented.

Even fewer people have a clear impression of it, with only occasional mentions in ancient texts. At this moment, Zhao Xu noticed that his dormitory had entered the final exam period, and everyone was diligently studying for the exam.

Even Zhang Qi, who was usually obsessed with gaming, was diligently reading books and logging in online at night, with much less online time. Zhao Xu's offline time was also limited, and he would only go online again tomorrow.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he extracted a folder containing his exam materials, he directly copied it to a USB drive and went to the print shop on the floor below to print out his review materials.

Although Zhao Xu now has the ability to memorize about 80% of the material, he still insists on keeping a printed copy of his review materials, a habit he's maintained until the last minute before the exam.

It's a common phenomenon among university students to cram at the last minute.

After returning to his dormitory, he began to review the exam materials for the upcoming exam.

As he flipped through the pages, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh at the vastness of his 22-point intelligence.

In general, he didn't attend classes much throughout the semester, but when he looked back at these knowledge points that he hadn't touched in ten years, he found it surprisingly easy.

He felt a mix of nostalgia and regret.

It's true that scholars like him saw knowledge points differently from ordinary people.

Zhao Xu's innate talent was sufficient to support him throughout high school.

However, when he entered a prestigious university, he encountered classmates who were all top scorers in their respective provinces, and naturally, he began to feel inferior.

Now that he has improved his level and made significant progress in logical thinking, calculation, and memory, he can quickly scan through his review materials without getting stuck at any point.

Just then, Zhang Qi stretched and walked over to Zhao Xu, taking a glance at the printed materials on his desk.

"You've been idle for two months, and you're still struggling to keep up?" Zhang Qi asked, eyes widening in surprise.

"Ah, you've put in some effort. Could it be that you've been secretly studying through games?" Zhang Qi couldn't help but ask in amazement.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu heard this, he didn't bother to respond to the other person and continued working on his task.

"Hey, hey, let me tell you, Xu Ge," suddenly Zhang Qi pulled over a stool, "Recently, the small town wants to apply for a branch of the 'Mage Association' and several well-known organizations to set up shop."

"Now, all the reports have been submitted, and I heard that the possibility of approval is at least 5-6%. As the secret silver production capacity of Starfall Town is very important, mages also desperately need this material."

Originally, Zhao Xu didn't care much about the organization's takeover, but when Lei An mentioned it to him, saying that if he performed well in the demon-capturing action, he might be able to be stationed in Starfall Town as the vice chairman of the "Mage Association".

Holding the third "notebook", Zhao Xu had already become a 6th-level mage, "What's wrong? Is there an introduction?" Zhao Xu asked directly.

"Heh heh, you're not at the Mage Association headquarters, Mistral, so the class guild also wants to use you to see if you can get any information," Zhang Qi smiled.

"Ah?"
