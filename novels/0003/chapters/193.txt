Chapter 194: The Chosen One of Prophecy

"Ah, Lixia, I think we should just take care of ourselves," said Zhao Xu in a gentle tone.

"Impossible, master. The 'Starlight Cloak' you're wearing can repel any non-magical attacks," Lixia replied.

At this point, Lixia had already entered professional mode and analyzed, "That's right, the 'Deep Furnace Magician' doesn't have magical weapons, and its natural weapons can't be considered magical either."

Lixia's implication was that Zhao Xu didn't need to worry too much about the opponent's close-range attacks.

Generally speaking, most monsters only have natural weapons and can't cause harm to Zhao Xu unless their natural weapons can be considered magical.

It's rare for monsters like the Heavenly God Servant to have a +5 Dancing Giant Sword and a +2 Killing and Longbow Combination that can be considered magical weapons.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu had looked over the entire set of data on the "Deep Furnace Magician" from Lei An the night before, and didn't flinch, instead looking at his own hand with a fierce gaze.

"Hey, master, what are you looking at me like that for? It's embarrassing," Lixia protested immediately.

"I think that the 'Deep Furnace Magician' might not have a hard time finding a magical weapon. As long as they give up their natural weapon attack power, it's enough to pierce my defense. And the opponent also has a special attack like 'Tightening', which can deal more than 30 points of damage if I struggle to break free."

Zhou Xu was about to say more, but then he noticed that there was a series of magical abilities that could blow him up to pieces, no matter which one he chose.

"Hey, Laksis, your attitude of not saying half of what you mean is very dangerous," Zhou Xu scolded his artifact spirit.

"Is that so? Ah, poor thing, it's hard to find a strong point of the master. How can it be rejected like this?" Laksis suddenly felt sorry for herself.

"That's your ritual, can't you change the way it is done, like going to 'Cursed Demons' or something like that?" Zhou Xu suggested.

At this moment, he had already thought of the "Cursed Demon" he had tested in the testing grounds, which he had defeated with a single arrow.

"Master, I think your face is thick enough," Laksis sarcastically said.

Zhou Xu thought so too, that a level 1 "Cursed Demon" and a level 20 "Deep Furnace Refining Demon" did have a certain gap.

"That's it, I'm definitely going to die now," Zhou Xu said. "Or maybe you can transform into a plot device?"

"What kind of plot device?"

"Just like that. I go over, say a few words, and then the other party kneels down, says 'Ah, I'm dead', and then commits suicide. It's like that kind of plot," Zhou Xu remembered vaguely.

"Master, I suggest you don't watch too many modified 'King Arthur's Fantasy Epic', or your intelligence may be damaged," Laksis weakly suggested.

"Seven Ring Profanity, Six Ring Summoning the Dead, Three Ring Fireball, Nine Ring Group Monster Binding, Eight Ring Evil Spirit Light, Eight Ring Commandment Shock, Seven Ring High-Level Teleport, Six Ring High-Level Spell Break,"

Zhou Xu recited the "Deep Furnace Refining Demon" magical abilities that could be used at will, no matter which one, and they all sounded incredibly brutal.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Lysander usually laughs with a gentle melody whenever she names a spell. How to do it? Deep in the abyss, without hesitation, she simply says 'Profane Language'. This means that within a 12-meter radius, all non-evil creatures with less than 10 life dice will die instantly without exception.

"Ah, master, how about this?" Lysander seems to know that she's being too strong-willed, "I'll transform into a divine tool to help you, master."

"Not necessary," Zhao Xiu immediately caught the opponent's slip-up.

Lysander explained to Zhao Xiu to avoid misunderstanding: "The ritual of connection allows you to use me for free once a day in the future."

"But since you haven't activated the ritual and my usage count is zero, you can only use another method to pre-emptively use me."

"The cost is that I'll be in a state of energy depletion for the next week, unable to transform into a divine tool again."

Lysander's every word Zhao Xiu understood, albeit a bit strange.

However, Zhao Xiu thought for a moment and realized that this was a one-way deal.

This divine tool was impossible to use except in a life-or-death situation.

In ordinary times, Lysander's greatest value was chatting with him.

Especially in the legendary city of floating, even an ordinary divine tool was nothing.

The divine tool also involved Yeg's first prophecy."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Other people will speculate, is it because he killed Zhao Xiu and obtained the "Eternal Holy Artifact" to find a way to add some time-related objects, so that they can meet the conditions and become the protagonist of the prophecy?

Yeg's prophecy is that the "Eternal Holy Artifact" follows him as the reason.

However, it is also Zhao Xiu's doomsday symbol.

So in this situation, it doesn't make much difference whether it is used once a week or once a day.

As long as Zhao Xiu can use it at the most critical moment, he can turn the tide with a single move.

This also means that in his most urgent moment, he actually has two opportunities to use the artifact.

"Is it because I gave up the union ritual with you that I won't become the person in the prophecy?" Zhao Xiu suddenly asked.

Originally, Lakshmi was still chattering nonstop, but she suddenly fell silent.

"No," she said after a long time.

"Abandoning one's identity can break free from the prophecy, and the person predicted by the prophecy is not the only one. History is a mutual creation."

Lakshmi spoke slowly.

Zhao Xiu looked at the curtain above the stone coffin, feeling a sense of sorrow.

Under the influence of the solemn will, the curtain, which had been here for a hundred years, looked as new as it was when it first started, as long as the magical power of the hall remained, it would always be like this.

But fate was different.

If another person who has the ability to "reverse the flow of time" came here and gained Lakshmi's recognition, then it would be the other person's turn to hear the prophecy and feel joyful.

This also means that if Zhao Xiu fails to challenge, he may not be the first person predicted by the prophecy.

Strictly speaking, he is Lakshmi's fifth-choice candidate.

Regardless of whether he dies or fails to complete the basic union ritual, Lakshmi will find someone else and wait for a new candidate to appear.

 Failure is what Lakshmi calls "abandoning one's identity".

"That's it, let's prepare to challenge," Zhao Xiu said.

"Hehe, I knew the master was indeed a brave and talented individual," Luxion said hastily, presenting a rainbow-colored bomb.

One revival stone could possibly exchange for the opportunity to obtain a "divine tool within a divine tool," which looked like a profitable deal no matter how you looked at it.

Moreover, this was Zhao Xu's first opportunity to obtain a new route outside of the Floating City.

Before, everything he had was mostly acquired from the Floating City, with more serving as cultivation targets, and he had been focused on cultivating them step by step.

This time, with the shielding power of the "altar," he had broken free from the Floating City's influence and entered the shadows for the first time.

He gained a new route's power.

Next, Zhao Xu began discussing the battle plan with Luxion, focusing on their coordination.

Then he left the stone coffin hall, preparing to head to the place where the "Deep Prison of the Infernal" was located.

"Ah, by the way, there's something I need to tell you, master," Luxion said suddenly just before they left the isolated gate.

"What?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It's about Yeg's zeroth prophecy, which is also a prophecy related to the seven major prophecies," Luxion said in a tense tone for the first time.

"7+1? Well, there are five people in the Four Heavenly Kings, and it's not uncommon," Zhao Xu said.

The seven major prophecies have an extra one, which isn't a problem.

Zhao Xu gestured for Luxion to continue.

"This prophecy is the true beginning of the seven major prophecies, and its content is as follows: 'When the seven great and immortal existences ascend to the divine throne and achieve the status of the supreme god, the Arthurian god system will be forever unchanging.'"

Zhao Xu froze in his steps at this moment.

It turned out that each prophecy represented seven new powerful gods?
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthurian divine order is organized according to divine systems, with each system having a main deity and multiple subordinate deities. As long as the main deity does not perish, the system will not disappear.

After the demise of the god of death, Nala, the subordinate deities under his control, such as the gods of slaughter and sin, were unable to ascend to the position of the main deity, and they gradually disappeared along with the faithful.

The main deity's divine power is determined by its own divine nature, while the power of subordinate deities is determined by the number of faithful in the divine system.

As a result, even the seven main deities will fight fiercely for their positions, and other subordinate deities, as well as numerous legendary adventurers and powerful beings in Arthur, will not be spared.

Raksha explained that the fourth prophecy's three magic goddesses, including Sislyvina, and the fifth prophecy's just god, Kuper, have already taken their positions.

Zhao Xu immediately understood that the previous major disaster period was also a time when the divine order was being formed.

At that time, at least two main deities had changed, but most of them were gods who had died before the prophecy, and were not within the scope of the prophecy.

After the prophecy, only the magic goddess and the just god had achieved the position of main deity.

This means that there are still five main deity positions remaining, and the divine order will stabilize and no longer change, without the chaotic battles that occurred during the previous major disaster period.

As for Zhao Xu, he was not one of them.

Zhao Xu was clear that this was just a possibility, as he had not heard the complete prophecy.

However, this also means that the people involved in the prophecy will be of great interest to various powers.

Achieving the gods, eternal and unchanging.

What could be more profitable than this deal?

At this moment, Zhao Xu also vaguely understood that when people on Earth crossed over to Arthur, they would receive corresponding help.
Because the seventh prophecy points to a future supreme deity!
