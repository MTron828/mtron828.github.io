Chapter 306: Unable to Revive

Glacier saw this scene and waved her hand, signaling the warriors to move forward. Within seconds, the entire guild had taken up the basic attacking formation.

After crossing the grassy mound in front, they discovered that four players were being surrounded by over a dozen goblins.

The mage was already wounded and leaned against a tree trunk, while the other three players were barely holding on.

Glacier didn't hesitate, waving her hand to signal her companions to take action.

"Whoosh!" a sound echoed.

Instantly, the red-skinned goblin that had been about to swing its axe was struck by an arrow shot from Glacier's snow-covered bow, piercing its heart.

The remaining over a dozen goblins were shocked and began to shout in their language, their bodies moving rapidly as they prepared to flee.

However, the guards of the guild were faster, firing a barrage of arrows that would knock down any goblin that was hit, given their low HP.

Meanwhile, the melee fighters and barbarians charged forward at lightning speed, swinging their giant swords and cleaving down their opponents.

After just one round of combat, over a dozen goblins had fallen, with the remaining few being surrounded and blocked by wandering nomads.

Even the poets, clergy, and mages, who were support classes, didn't need to lift a finger, as the over a dozen goblins were wiped out within three rounds.

The guards of the guild looked exhausted after fighting the giant, but when it came to fighting low-level goblins, they were relentless, crushing their opponents with ease.
Here is the translation:

As the four-person team that had survived the attack was looking at Zhao Xun and his team in surprise, a poet in the lead said, "Thank you, you wouldn't have made it if we hadn't arrived." 

Glacier, who had not expected to encounter players in this place, asked curiously, "What's the point of running so far? Have new players become so reckless now?"

At this moment, everyone's gaze fell on the few players who had just been surrounded. They had also roughly figured it out.

The four people did not even have basic armor, and their swords were even missing handles. It seemed like they were new players who had just started leveling up.

In an instant, the contrast between Glacier's elite team and the four people became stark.

"We took on a task to find Moonlight Grass," the team leader, the poet, said. "We've been traveling for a few days, and we thought it was safe, but who would have expected to run into something like this?"

Glacier listened, his face turning white, and began to explain the specific location of Moonlight Grass. As he spoke, the faces of the four people opposite him grew increasingly dark.

For Glacier, who was used to being a big fish in a small pond, two months had been long enough for them to figure out the distribution of basic resource collection points around Mistral.

These four novice players, however, seemed to have gone off track.

After a long time, the poet spoke up again, "Thank you for your guidance. What's your business?"

Glacier, who had been interacting with Zhao Xun for a few days, was almost skeptical, but eventually met a player. He said directly, "Mistral, Guardian's Guild, Glacier."

"Wow, it seems we've met a master. You're all from the Guardian's Guild, which is one of the top three guilds in Mistral."

At that moment, the four players who had also been born in Mistral looked up at them with admiration.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, a few people started to chat casually, slowly shifting the topic to people they both knew. Standing far away, Zhao Xu saw this situation and couldn't help but laugh. Even though the Guardian Association, which was almost wiped out by his two spells, had already become a prominent existence among Mistrals players, its strength far surpassed ordinary players.

When Zhao Xu encountered ordinary players in the wild, his sword became an object of reverence. This made Zhao Xu ponder the obvious talent gap between players of the same level.

Later, the four players noticed Zhao Xu and the "soul of the cursed" on his body and asked curious questions. Although the sword didn't want to say much, it revealed that Zhao Xu was an NPC mage.

The players from the Guardian Association relaxed their guard and exchanged a few words with the sword, learning that he had at least ten magical equipment on him, making their eyes shine with excitement.

At this time, the sword glanced at the sky and the surrounding environment and nodded to the four people to leave. The team leader, the poet, said, "Hey, our team's mage has hit a bottleneck. Can we give him a chance to ask the mage a question, please?"

As the poet requested, the sword thought about the powerful mages and didn't say much, just allowing the four people to go. After getting permission, the poet led his other three companions to go. "Mr. Mage, excuse me, but we're bothering you," the four players said as they approached Zhao Xu's face.
Here is the translation of the text:

The adventurers who were surrounding Zhao Xu, led by a cool and calm expression, slightly relaxed their vigilance and turned their attention to the surroundings. Zhao Xu didn't say much, just nodded calmly, looking like a typical NPC mage from Arthur.

Just then, the wandering soul walked over, pulled out a scroll from their pouch, and was about to hand it over to Zhao Xu.

But in the blink of an eye, the other party member's wrist flicked, causing the original scroll to fall apart, revealing a shining dagger inside, which was then thrust directly at Zhao Xu.

At the same time, the poet pulled out a lightweight crossbow and fired an arrow directly at Zhao Xu, while the mage began to chant a magic spell from a scroll, and the warrior swung their sword to strike Zhao Xu.

In an instant, the four of them launched a simultaneous attack on Zhao Xu.

However, Zhao Xu's hand was still holding the "Super Magic Instant Release Staff" on his lap, and he immediately grasped it without hesitation. With a wave of his hand, he released a spell, unleashing a magical attack - the Two-Ring Mirror Illusion.

Instantly, Zhao Xu's entire body was surrounded by ten illusory projections, creating chaos and disrupting everyone's judgment.

These illusory projections seemed like real people, making instinctive dodging movements. The thief's dagger struck, piercing the fake projection in front of him, and similarly, the warrior's powerful sword strike also hit the illusion. The poet's arrow shot from the crossbow also hit another illusory projection.

Meanwhile, the mage finally managed to release a magic spell that he thought was guaranteed to hit, but it also landed on a fake projection.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu's illusions merged with his real body, resulting in 11 "others," of which four were eliminated immediately, leaving seven. At this moment, the adventurers from the Adventurer's Guild and the wild men had already rushed over, pinning down several people and taking them into custody. With the help of ropes, they bound the four players they had encountered on the road, securing them tightly.

Just then, Shao Jian exclaimed, "Are you exacting revenge for an injustice?" On the opposite side, the wanderer's face turned slightly pale, and he couldn't help but say, "Shao Jian, I'll take care of it for you. In this wilderness, killing these NPCs is as simple as killing a few low-level mages. I've killed over three or four novice mages with this trick before. If you cooperate, even if the mages have multiple illusions, they'll all die."

However, he found it strange that the members of the Guardian's Guild were staring at him with a foolish expression. As for Zhao Xu, who had become the target, he sat on his horse, flipping through the magic tome just pulled out from his backpack, as if he didn't care at all about the other party's intentions to kill him.

The wanderer also realized that the Guardian's Guild did not accept his suggestion, and he shook his head: "Although I don't know what kind of person this Zhao Xu is, can you really get tens of magic equipment for more gains? I'm doing this for you guys, think about it, one magic equipment can sell for how many yuan?"

"It's not possible, you're just joking, thinking that NPCs are the same as players. You're colluding with NPCs to bind us, that's adultery." The wanderer sneered.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Frost Sword looked at Zhao Xu, "How did you handle them, Wind Mage?"

Zhao Xu also gently closed the book in his hand and looked at the wanderer who was not a poet, "It seems that you are the true team leader. You seem to be very proficient in doing this. You didn't even need to communicate with your teammates, you just took action. You're very skilled."

The wanderer also spat out some saliva on the ground, "Because everyone's attention was focused on the poet who was talking, it was convenient for me to secretly give orders. I've done something like this about ten times, but unfortunately, this time it didn't work out."

As he looked down at everyone with disdain, "If you're going to kill, just kill. I've been waiting for my five Revive Stones to go bad. Ah, it's really annoying that you people are so foolish. One Revive Stone can bring in millions of yuan in benefits, but you're not willing to take the risk."

Zhao Xu also shook his head. This kind of player who was stuck on the evil path was indeed not worth talking to.

Anyway, let him learn a lesson.

He knows that there are some mistakes, and the price is not just one Revive Stone.

"Frost Sword, can you give me a region?" Zhao Xu said with a smile, revealing a kind expression.

Frost Sword could only nod silently, not understanding what this Wind Mage meant. In fact, they were just retaliating against the opponent and killing them directly.

...

The forum topic about being unable to revive was pushed to the top, and everyone discovered that the several posts describing the same thing were all about players being killed and unable to use Revive Stones.
