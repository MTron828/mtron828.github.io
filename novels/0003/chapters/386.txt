Chapter 387: Reunion
Zhao Xu suddenly felt that he couldn't betray Wang Qingwei.

Although they rarely interacted with each other due to their tasks, Zhao Xu still remembered that he, Wang Qingwei, and Esveiski had left a half-finished copy in the "True Illusion" of the 7th floor of the Hall of Knowledge.

Every time he thought about it, he felt a subtle sense of direction in his heart, which was clearly not a small matter.

Arthur didn't behave like other online games, where opening a window could instantly communicate with each other. Therefore, Zhao Xu often communicated with Esveiski and Wang Qingwei offline.

As his intelligence increased, he gradually became able to suppress the level of the two people.

One thing he was sure of was that without external enhancement, 18 points of intelligence would likely be the limit for ordinary people.

This also made their group chat gradually lose its restraint.

Especially when Zhao Xu was assigned to be the vice chairman of the Starlight City, both of them silently expressed their admiration and even joked about becoming personal secretaries.

However, Zhao Xu could only "helplessly" express that the secretary's position had already been taken.

As a result, he naturally felt embarrassed to let his classmates from Nan Xiu see such private topics.

In fact, no one had expected that in the later period, the one who started the car in the group was not the relatively open Esveiski, but Wang Qingwei.

This directly shattered his idealized expectations of the goddess, although she was someone who was kind and warm-hearted, and had sacrificed herself to some extent.

It's natural for girls who like two-dimensional characters to each have their own unique features. However, at this moment, he naturally couldn't reveal the fact that Wang Qingwei was on the same side as him. So, he just flashed the phone and disappeared. This also made the classmates who had been intimidated by him suddenly full of doubts.

"Personal chat, don't make it public, okay?" Zhao Xu explained.

"Ah, Qingwei Sister will send you emoticons like that," Xiaola laughed directly and lightly, "What's there to hide?"

"Did she send you one?" Zhao Xu was surprised.

Xiaola's face turned red, "Qingwei Sister is very refined, but you don't know that, she's not unfamiliar with men's QQ. I can add him, and we've met in real life."

"So you're definitely lying, especially since you're such a big pig's feet," Xiaola said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu felt that the other party was getting a bit ridiculous.

He didn't care about crushing the girl's good-hearted thinking and directly went to Wang Qingwei's QQ profile page in front of Xiaola.

"You think you can just open the group chat and......" Xiaola said halfway before falling silent.

At first, she noticed Wang Qingwei's QQ number showing the group chat level Lv9, which was obviously opened from the Q group chat. However, the "Add Friend" option was replaced by "Audio and Video Chat" at the bottom left corner, indicating that they were already friends. At this time, Zhao Xu didn't notice that he had accidentally pressed the back button, and the chat interface disappeared, with the "3" character in the group chat number appearing like a red seal on her mind.

How many times can you chat to get a three-person group to Lv9?

As Zhao Xu didn't wait for Xiaola to continue looking at the content, he had already put his phone away.

He looked at the girl's face, which was filled with loss and hard to believe, and genuinely believed that Wang Qingwei was probably not going to add a stranger as a friend.

He didn't expect that he had even added Wang Qingwei as a friend. It turned out that this was the key to defeating the opponent's momentum.

He realized that it was probably Wang Qingwei who had offended Xiaoli, the girl in front of him, and that Xiaoli needed him to take Wang Qingwei down.

As he thought about his idol, who was chatting with a man who didn't look like a typical handsome and charming type, even to the point of revealing their true feelings, he couldn't help but feel heartbroken.

It was as if his long-held beliefs had been directly shattered.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to speak, he found that the original waiter knocked on the door. His whole body was filled with excitement, and his face turned red as he asked the crowd, "Who is Mr. Zhao Xu?"

The attention of most people fell on Zhao Xu.

He was the only one with this unfamiliar name.

Zhao Xu then quietly stood up, wondering if his mom thought he had brought Xiaoli to sing K-pop and had specifically come knocking on the door?

The waiter, panting for breath, said, "Two ladies are waiting for you at the door."

Zhao Xu walked out with a bewildered expression.

The waiter, who had found him, looked cold and stiff, like a duck taking steps.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was nothing for Zhao Xu to scheme about, nor did he have much to worry about. He quietly reached into his pocket, relying on his tactile memory to directly switch the phone to the dialing interface and input the number 110, waiting for an unexpected call to go through.

His eyes were constantly scanning the surrounding buildings, thinking about the best escape route and what weapons he could grab quickly.

Since taking on the role of "hunter" in Aur√©lien, Zhao Xu no longer approached problems mechanically.

When he entered the new scene, he would instinctively think about escape routes and methods, no longer waiting for death.

As he walked in front of the top-level VIP rooms at the KTV, Zhao Xu noticed that the entire floor was empty, with no guards in sight.

He glanced at the waiter who had led him to the door and restored his expression to a stiff one, and then pushed the door open and walked in.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's entire body seemed to be under control, as if he had been "human-freezing" spellbound.

His breath seemed to be stuck in his chest, and his throat was hoarse, unable to make a sound. His head spun around, repeatedly circulating various strange and mixed emotions.

"Teacher?"

Zhao Xu thought that everything was just a secret understanding between him and An Niya.

But he didn't expect that An Niya would eventually come to Earth and appear before him.

At this time, An Niya had no longer worn a mask, with her long hair flowing down, and her lovely face was beyond the limitation of time.

She stood near the door, waiting and looking at Zhao Xu as if recalling past memories.

"Surprise?" An Niya said with a hint of playfulness.

"I don't know if I'm happy, but it's definitely surprising," Zhao Xu joked.

This time, he could only make a bitter smile.
Here is the translation of the text:

The appearance of Anniya, indicating that the opponent had torn open the fact that Arthur was a real person in this world.

Zhou Xu, who had been silent and pretending not to know, was forced to face this issue again.

"However, teacher, is everything okay after you arrived on Earth?" Zhou Xu asked.

"Don't get excited, we're just projections here," Anniya said, as if it were a trivial matter.

"Just our projection is a legend-level magic, and you can't use it now," Anniya said, as if it were a trivial matter.

Zhou Xu only noticed that there was another woman in the room, but she had a hood up and her face was not visible.

"What's the reason for you guys coming here?" Zhou Xu asked, pulling Anniya back into the room.

"We're going to send you something," Anniya said softly.

"You're so calm, it seems like you've guessed that Arthur is real, and the magic you've learned is also real and unparalleled," the mysterious woman said.

Zhou Xu asked, "Are there others who are aware of this?"

The mysterious woman didn't answer again.

"Okay," Anniya said, pulling Zhou Xu along. "Want to sing together?"

The two people with clever language skills, who basically carried a built-in simultaneous translation device, spoke and sang in Earth languages without any problems.

Zhou Xu looked up and saw that the three songs above were "Grasp the Heart", "No One", and "Remember Not to Forget", which were all songs he had sung in his high school's top 10 songs.

It was really too coincidental.

"Let's just skip the singing," Zhou Xu said.

These backup songs were not very suitable for his current mood.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Alright then," An Xi Niya said, taking out a needle from her pocket and handing it to Zhao Xu, "keep it with you at all times."
"What's this for?" Zhao Xu asked, having lost his magical abilities and unable to identify the needle.

"It's a lifesaver in emergency situations," An Xi Niya explained. "You're in more danger now that you're on Earth."

This statement made Zhao Xu's heart tighten.

Did this mean that Earth would have unexpected changes?

An Xi Niya was worried about his life and safety, and even more so about the people around him.

"Where are we going next?" Zhao Xu asked, "Why don't I book a hotel for us to rest?"

The two of them suddenly used a luxurious house spell on the street, which would surely shock everyone.

"No need, we can just go to your place," An Xi Niya said with a sudden smile.

"?" Zhao Xu's face was filled with question marks.

"You mean, like the custom of bringing a girlfriend to your home?" An Xi Niya explained. "We can stay at your place for a night, and then we'll leave. You can just say goodbye and save your money."

Zhao Xu shook his head, unable to bear his instructor's unrealistic joke.

"I've had enough of your jokes," he said.

Just then, An Xi Niya's expression turned serious as she spoke to Zhao Xu, "You have four months left."

Not a moment later, another elegant woman suddenly appeared beside him, whispering in his ear, "Remember this incantation, I can only tell you this incantation on Earth."
