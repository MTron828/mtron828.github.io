Chapter 421: Elemental Seal

When South Xiaoyu heard Zhao Xu's response, she was about to tell Zhao Xu not to joke around. However, looking at the other party's calm expression, her previous doubts suddenly had nowhere to go.

The suspicion born from her curiosity gradually dissipated.

The term "Zhong Xia" echoed in her mind, bringing with it a sense of joy. It was a mixture of admiration and the kind of excitement one feels when reuniting with an old friend.

"Ah! Zhao Xu, you've actually entered the internal mechanism of the artifact! Are you, are you..."

Like a girl in her teenage years, South Xiaoyu has always had a sense of longing for powerful characters in games.

The name "Zhong Xia" had already caused a stir after the first announcement, with many people searching for clues about the profession training venue. Even some studios and investors were secretly inquiring about the price of the "artifact", hoping to get a head start by placing a deposit.

Some people claimed to have heard of such a person, but the description didn't quite fit, and it was rare to hear of players being able to perform such long-distance teleportation.

The distance from Mistral to the Northern Alliance is so great that even if you rode a horse from the moment the game started, you wouldn't be able to complete half the journey.

Unless it's a teleportation.

It was only after the second announcement that the news about the breakthrough in the first seal of the demon prison became a hot topic on the forum, with the name "Zhong Xia" becoming a hot topic once again.
Here is the translation:

The other adventurers continued to struggle for a whole day, unable to break through any of the five locks, while the opponent had already broken the "Illusion Seal" and was about to enter the final countdown. The adventurer team that had entered the castle had already discovered that the site had 12 large doors, a significant increase from the six seals.

As a result, the team was eager to ask the first player to successfully clear the game about the correct doors and the specific level format. At this time, many online forum players were constantly refreshing the live post and following the development of the "Higher God Tool".

South Yuan couldn't help but say, "Are you now among the elite players?" Her eyes sparkled with a flash of light. South Yuan had not played much during school time, but after the holiday, she had a deeper understanding of the game.

In Arthur, even the poorest people couldn't afford a basic suit of armor. It was only the exceptional players who could equip special-effect magic items. If Zhao Xu could get the "Godly Tool" smoothly, it would mean he would definitely rank among the top 10 players in Arthur.

South Yuan let out a sigh of relief and her voice was tinged with a hint of sadness. Zhao Xu looked puzzled and didn't know what had triggered South Yuan's emotional response. Although he hadn't obtained the "Holy Breath", it was the current top existence in the game. Even he now had such a tool in his hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu asked, "What's wrong? Have you been bullied?"

Little Yu sighed and said, "It's just that in the birthplace of Arthur, we're a small town without a complete vocational training system. It's really a poor and dirty place. Some players who leveled up quickly started bullying us new players, making us pay protection fees and so on. It's infuriating."

As Little Yu described the experience, her eyes flashed with anger, but not a single spark was diminished.

Zhao Xu knew that Little Yu's description must have some exaggerated parts, but he couldn't have imagined that "old players" would start bullying new players, taking advantage of their low levels, just four months after the game started.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "If it weren't for Zhang Qi and others helping me, I would have been exploited by those old players who already occupied good positions."

He said, "I'll take care of it."

Little Yu snorted and said, "I'm almost leaving that dump anyway. It's not just the students from our high school; everyone's level is low, and we're too scared to fight, so we got exploited. Anyway, I'll come find you after a while, Xu Gege."

As she spoke, Little Yu flashed a smile that was a perfect blend of green tea and awkwardness, which didn't quite match her current short hair and baby fat.

Zhao Xu just lightly tapped his opponent's forehead and said, "Your hairband is too ugly. If you really come to the Northern Alliance, I'll definitely take you."

As he spoke, Zhao Xu put away the chopsticks and went to the kitchen.

Meanwhile, his mind was still thinking about Zheng Xin Yu's situation, and he could basically get Zheng Xin Yu's current information from the information he had collected from his follower, Elliot, earlier.
Here is the translation of the text:

The other person is far away from him, and the spiritual power signal is also intermittent. It's unknown whether she can complete the priest training on time.

..."Let's choose this door then." Zhao Xu gazed at the door that was several meters high and said.

"Yes." Vivian also raised her sacred avenger and tightened her body.

After Zhao Xu's introduction, she already knew everything.

From now on, they will enter rooms where they might encounter the same adventure team that has entered the Aizhou Palace.

After the critical point of six hours ago, the entire Aizhou Palace had sunk into the earth.

Only the "Anti-Magic Zone" on the surface still existed, intimidating the mages, preventing them from rushing in.

This means that over the next few days, even if the Northern Alliance sends a team to search for the Aizhou Palace, it will be difficult to detect its existence.

Unless they can dig deep into the earth, which is a tedious and unrewarding task.

"If we encounter other adventure teams when we enter, it means we will be enemies," Zhao Xu asked.

"I understand," Vivian nodded. "I'll complete my task well, and I won't go against my conscience. I'm not a mindless machine."

Zhao Xu forced a smile, but Zhao Xu didn't believe it.

As the sound of a mechanical device echoed, Zhao Xu's expression tightened.

Besides Vivian's floating shield in front of them, Zhao Xu's magic was also accumulated and ready to be released.

The next person to attack them would not just be the monsters hidden in the Aizhou Palace, but even live players.
Here is the translation of the text:

Due to the existence of the anti-magic field, the ratio of mages in this team is significantly lower than the usual configuration.

As the "bang-bang-bang" sound of the rotation stopped.

Everything was calm and quiet.

Zhao Xiu and Wei Wei looked at the empty stone room before them, with walls made of yellow mud bricks covered in cement, and no cracks or crevices to be found.

The small lamp above emitted a dim, yellowish light, casting an eerie glow on their faces.

"Four doors, four objects," Wei Wei murmured to herself.

Zhao Xiu nodded in agreement.

This was a challenge he had intentionally chosen after analyzing the forum discussions.

In front of the stone room was a hidden door that was seamlessly integrated into the surrounding walls, the only way to the next stone room.

Of course, Zhao Xiu now held a "Passage Spellstaff" that could also cast the "Pass Through" spell.

However, this room had a twist.

As soon as you touched the door and walls, the coal fire pot, green gemstone water cup, gilded alchemy furnace, and rough-hewn stone head would simultaneously summon four small elements.

In the next stone room, four medium-sized elements would be summoned, and so on.

The previous adventure team's strength was not bad, but they still failed at the stage of summoning large elements.

The opponent team, which carried two players, used the revival stone to revive and successfully spread the content of this challenge on the forum.

Originally, Zhao Xiu didn't care who went first or second.

However, after experiencing the first stage, he realized that he was carrying five golden bronze treasure boxes, one of which had absorbed the mysterious symbol through the process and transformed into the "Legendary Secret Silver Golem" and "Legendary Fine Gold Golem".
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's strength surged several times over. To avoid the difficulty of the next stage, Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then decided to trigger the "Element Seal" that was controllable in difficulty.

At this point, Zhao Xu stood in front of the door to the next chamber and whispered, "Shall I begin?"

"Go ahead," came the response.

Vivian's eyes flashed with a fierce aura, reminiscent of her training in the depths of the underworld.

"Snap!" Zhao Xu lightly tapped the door.

In an instant, the four corners of the room, which had originally been plain and unadorned, suddenly connected to the powers of the four elements, setting off a wave of elemental energy in the air. Then, a thick fog burst forth. The fire, wind, water, and earth elements crawled out of the vessels, like they had just experienced a summoning spell.

The four elements, now standing in the corners, gazed malevolently at Zhao Xu and Vivian, who stood before the stone door.

"Cut it short," Zhao Xu said directly.

The four elements, small creatures about a meter tall, weighed less than a kilogram, with the fire and wind elements being even lighter. Their challenge level was around level 1, far from being a match for Zhao Xu and his party.

Even without Zhao Xu's intervention, these small elements with a mere 11 HP would be no match for Vivian's casual sword strike.

The only thing Zhao Xu and his party needed to pay attention to was that they had to kill all four elements within one round. If they failed, the elements would continue to resurrect, and the next time, there would be double the number. This was the rule of the chamber.
