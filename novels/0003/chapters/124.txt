Chapter 125: The Path

When Zhao Xu walked out of the door, he found an old man waiting for him. It's not unusual to see many elderly people in Floating City, as most wizards' abilities are closely tied to the accumulation of time.

Most wizards choose to extend their lifespan through various means, rather than resorting to the costly and risky method of reversing their aging process. Let alone the option of achieving immortality by transforming into another species.

"What do you want?" the old man asked, his wizard's robe immaculate, with not a single wrinkle. This was not the attire of a novice or a legendary wizard, but rather someone who didn't bother to dress up to flaunt their identity, like someone like Rai An.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, this is your prize, as you were the first to complete the trial." The old man, whose withered body stood at an angle, had a face weathered by the passage of time.

But when he turned to face Zhao Xu, his eyes, which had been narrowed to slits, opened wide, radiating an aura of superiority. Zhao Xu, who had once served as the guardian of the Northern Lord, almost felt a sense of disorientation, as if he was facing a monarch.

However, this was not too unrealistic, as Arthur's monarch was someone he could still recognize. At this moment, the old man extended his gnarled hand, holding a "automatic recording feather pen" identical to the one Zhao Xu had received earlier.

Zhao Xu was curious: "Didn't I already receive one?"

"No, Mr. Zhong Xia, this one is your reward for winning over all the apprentices, while the one given by Miss Anxinyue is a special gift just for you. The two do not conflict."

Zhao Xu wouldn't refuse a gift from someone else, but he would definitely take it back to Anxinyue to verify it before using it.

After Zhao Xu took the package, he noticed that the old man was still standing, unaffected. He didn't hesitate or ask any questions, and directly walked down the corridor. At that time, Zhao Xu didn't notice that the old man was slightly bowing his waist, showing respect towards him.

After returning, Zhao Xu followed Anis Noa's instructions and moved his luggage to the Octagonal Tower. This was also a tradition in Float City, where any apprentice wizard who became a licensed wizard would have to move out of their dormitory after three months. It wasn't that the wizards didn't have a place to live, but rather it was a way to encourage new wizards to find their own homes quickly.

Zhao Xu's new home was naturally the "Final Scroll", so his dormitory was reassigned to the sixth floor of the Octagonal Tower. The Octagonal Tower was basically a renovated space, so it was rare for wizards to have problems with housing.

Zhao Xu's luggage was not extensive, mainly consisting of some magic books he had left behind during his previous outings. As he was packing, he also thought back to the events that occurred when he was copying the scroll. Originally, he thought it would be very difficult, but when he actually started writing, he found that the powers of the symbols automatically flowed from his mind onto the scroll.

It was as if he had practiced it countless times before. This extraordinary familiarity made Zhao Xu realize that he must have already become a 1st-level wizard, and it was natural for him to have mastered the skill of copying scrolls. After all, most new wizards would first master the skills of copying scrolls and summoning familiars before copying enough spells to become a licensed wizard.
At this moment, Zhao Xu didn't know how he had performed at that time, completely shocking those who had started learning the expertise with him at the same time. It wasn't until Zhao Xu finished moving his things that he had a chance to catch his breath. At this time, he placed the quill given to him by Antinoya, and the old man's quill, side by side on the table. They looked almost identical, with no special markings. It was fortunate, otherwise wouldn't it mean that both quills were products of Antinoya? According to Antinoya's personality, she didn't like her things being touched by strangers. Wouldn't this mean that Antinoya had long been certain that he would be the first to successfully transcribe the scroll? If so, the prophecy spell was too overbearing. After a while, Antinoya also came to his new dorm. She was already aware of Zhao Xu's recent experience, but she didn't praise him much, instead saying to him, "Let's go, I'll take you to see why the Scroll Scholar is so powerful." When Zhao Xu heard this, he immediately thought of it. He envied the profession of the Scroll Scholar, thinking that it was no less than that of a mage, mainly due to the discussions on the Scroll Scholar on the forum in his previous life. At that time, the Scroll Scholar was no longer a secret, and many people knew that there was still such a profession as a spellcaster. He was essentially a mirror image of a mage, similar in that both required studying spells, transcribing them into prayer books, and the strength of the spells was determined by intelligence. So in the future, Zhao Xu would focus on improving as a Scroll Scholar, and he wouldn't have to worry about the problem of dispersed attributes, just focusing on increasing his intelligence. The only difference from a mage was that the Scroll Scholar released divine spells, not arcane ones. Spells are mainly divided into two categories, arcane and divine.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some spells are both arcane and divine, such as detection magic, which allows both mages and clerics to cast spells. For example, the mage's shield that Zhao Xu likes to use is pure arcane magic, and clerics can't use it. If the scroll is that simple, it won't be blown away by the scroll masters.

In terms of professional skills, mages have only three skills at level 1, including copying scrolls and summoning pets. They can only gain one advanced skill every five levels. Among the scroll masters, only two levels from 1 to 20 are empty and have no skill upgrades. The rest are occupied by various skill upgrades. As for what skills the scroll masters have, it's very mysterious and not revealed too much.

However, everyone is very enthusiastic about it.

At this time, Zhao Xu and Annabella sat in the automatic elevator of the octagonal tower, sitting in the furnace driven by magic, going down.

Annabella, relying on her latent ability, can recover unlimitedly, and basically exceed 300 meters. She will choose to teleport. For 20 meters, she will flash away. Zhao Xu now understands that the other side is using the "Higher-Dimensional Leap" spell, a nine-level spell that lasts for a long time.

However, the octagonal tower is shielded from teleportation except for the top, so Annabella can only bring Zhao Xu along the way.

"Teacher, are we going to practice 'Dark Knowledge'?" Zhao Xu asked.

Although the abilities of the scroll masters are mysterious, the first ability, Dark Knowledge (Combat), has been revealed to increase attack power when facing monsters, making warriors want to team up with scroll masters.
Here is the translation of the text:

The scholars of the ancient tome are useless, with only the terrifying secret of the 11th level that can intimidate others and barely allow them to fight. Anzuo Noya, as always, answered Zhao Xu's childish questions.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood what was going on.

The ancient tome of the forum was blown, and the angle was wrong.

It's not that they have strong professional skills, but rather that they have strong magic, right?

Even the priests have similar divine powers, and they're given to them for free by the gods.

Magicians have to copy spells at a cost, and ancient tomes have to copy spells at a cost as well.

If Zhao Xu hadn't been able to hold onto Anzuo Noya's thigh, he would have had to go to the floating city to work as a service worker to earn the costs of copying spells.

However, Anzuo Noya pulled Zhao Xu out of the second floor and led him around a few bends before arriving at a dead end.

Zhao Xu looked at the dead end and thought about whether there was a secret door.

However, Anzuo Noya simply muttered a spell and it was over in an instant, just like a whisper.

Zhao Xu knew that Anzuo Noya had cast a spell, but he didn't know what kind of spell it was.

"Let's go," Anzuo Noya said.

Zhao Xu looked around, but he didn't see Anzuo Noya open any secret door.

Then, Anzuo Noya pulled Zhao Xu's sleeve and led him towards the wall in front of him.

Just as they were about to collide, the entire wall seemed to be an illusion, offering no resistance to them.

After a slight dizziness, Zhao Xu found himself in a sealed room with no windows or doors, like a box.

If there hadn't been a ceiling light, he would have had psychological trauma.

"Just now, it was the 7th-level spell 'Relative Position', which opens the spiritual channel and allows us to pass through that wall to get here," Anzuo Noya said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu finally understood why there was no door or window in this room. In the situation where the shielding transmission technique was applied, the mage's position transfer spell was the one-time key to entering here. It was a bit luxurious.

At this time, Zhao Xu began to observe the things in the room. There were 12 identical classical mirrors, standing upright at the 12-hour intervals on the clock face. The mirrors were mostly 1.2 meters high and 1 meter wide, all covered with a deep-colored curtain.

"What is this?" Zhao Xu asked, once he had seen similar mirrors in the treasure trove of the legendary mage, Anastasia, but they were much larger. Otherwise, he would definitely be interested in the mirrors.

"This is a mirror of the enemy's soul," someone said. "If you pull back the curtain and gaze at the mirror, you will summon a duplicate of yourself, with the same equipment, abilities, and spells as yours. Then it will attack you with all its might."

"Are you kidding me?" Zhao Xu's heart, which had long been tempered like steel, began to shake with surprise.

A legendary mage, summoning a legendary mage? It was impossible.

"These mirrors were all made by King Ernest, the Ouroboros King, using the principle of cloning," Anastasia explained. "However, the method and craftsmanship have been lost for a long time. The remaining ones are stored here. There is a way to break these mirrors, but it's too dangerous, so they're just left here to be discarded."

Zhao Xu gazed at the 12 mirrors, which were more terrifying than a horror movie.

If a ghost came out, Anastasia would definitely solve it easily. But if a duplicate of Anastasia came out, she should be able to fight back, and Zhao Xu wouldn't be able to withstand the aftereffects of the spell.

"What should we do?"
"There is a mirror among them that serves as a passage, find it and that will be enough."
"Where does it lead?" Zhao Xu turned to look at Antinoya.
"To the original scroll."
