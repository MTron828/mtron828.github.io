Chapter 094, Level 2

"Ah, what a rare encounter! A person who is both a mage and a pastor, how can I not take care of him?" Magician Rayne said, maintaining his elegant posture like a noble.

Zhao Xu was not surprised; just a moment ago, he had unleashed the spell "Holy Domain" and had no intention of hiding it from the mysterious person in front of him.

Magician Rayne looked up at the dark tunnel above, his neck already completely wrapped in black scales, resembling a block of cooled, molten lava.

"I once longed to be a part-time pastor, level 1, so I could smoothly advance to 'Curse Text Guardian'." Magician Rayne suddenly looked down at Zhao Xu with a sinister gaze.

"Why didn't the goddess give me this opportunity? Is my faith not devout enough? Why did you, with ease, become the goddess's pastor?"

Zhao Xu, who had been planning to use his trump card, was not the slightest bit nervous, even though the magician in front of him looked like half a demon.

"What do you ask me? I'll ask someone else," Zhao Xu said carelessly, sensing that Magician Rayne's mental state was a bit off.

A calm mage is far more frightening than a crazy one.

"Ah, it seems no one has taught you about the advancement to 'Curse Text Guardian'." Magician Rayne suddenly looked down, his hands buried in his hair, tightly grasping them.

His originally slender, mage-like hands, which had been invaded by the power of the underworld, had swollen into long, black-scaled muscles.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why do people like you, who are utterly ignorant and clueless, become 'Incantation Guardians' candidates, while I, who kneel night and day in front of the gods, begging for their mercy, can't even get a chance to enter the door?"

Lawyer Ray suddenly lifted his head and let out a furious roar.

Zhao Xu was about to unleash his energy, but his magical detection skills remained completely still until the roar subsided.

This is the reason he needs to level up to a 1st-level priest?

Zhao Xu thought to himself, but he also had some reservations about whether he should spit it out or not.

Just then, Ray's gaze fell on the staff in Zhao Xu's hand.

"Is this really a protective staff? It's ridiculous that even a couple of low-level novice priests can carry such a valuable item? Which school of magic or church has the means to afford such an item?"

Zhao Xu had already silently confirmed that this priest must be a bit crazy.

He didn't know whether it was due to the influence of dark powers or if he had gone mad from staying here for too long.

Even a proud priest like Ray shouldn't be acting this way.

According to the intelligence level of a typical priest, it's impossible for someone to notice all these things and react instantly. That's just ridiculous.

This is also one of the reasons why Arthur is so difficult to deal with. In battle, not only does he suppress his opponents with his magic, but also with his intelligence.

"You're relying on this staff to bring these newbies on an adventure?" Ray nodded and surveyed him.

"You dare to enter the outside altar, relying on the 'Exorcism' spell from this staff, even if there are demons inside. Unfortunately, you're facing me..."
Here is the translation of the text:

When he heard this, Zhào Xù couldn't help but smile wryly. The Exorcism spell is effective against demons, but this half-demon creature is a local monster outside the scope of the spell. However, Zhào Xù's confidence was no longer based on his defensive wand. He was a bit unclear about the thoughts of the mage in front of him.

Is he going to try to crush his confidence with words? That wouldn't be necessary, since he's already at a disadvantage. But Zhào Xù still needed to figure out the mage's thoughts before taking action.

At this point, Zhào Xù also made up his mind to go back and study hard. He really couldn't afford to meet someone like this high-level mage without being able to put up a fight.

"Mages can also use the 'Protective Barrier' spell to ensure that except for undead creatures, no one can touch or attack you. And since I'm a mage, I can cast spells above the 4th level without entering the barrier. I can eliminate you without needing to enter the barrier. This is a mockery of fate, as if the goddess has arranged for me to kill one of her priests to vent my anger," the mage Lyen suddenly became lost in thought.

"Then try it," Zhào Xù said.

He would wait to see if the mage Lyen was a 17th-level mage.

The benefits given by An Ti Noya were too strong, and he didn't dare to use them carelessly. If he had only a wand like this, he would have slapped the mage's face long ago.

As for the Pray Candle artifact, he had no confidence in using it successfully in front of this high-level mage.

"Although I want to kill you," Lyen suddenly whispered, "I can also spare your life."

"Condition?" Zhào Xù directly responded.

This encounter made him suspect that the mage had some secrets behind him, but he lacked the clues to uncover them.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There are seven people lying on the ground in total, and you only need to kill three of them. I can let you and the remaining four people go, and I'll also give you a precious magical item as a gift." Lyra smiled lowly, her voice hoarse.

Zhao Xun chuckled coldly and said, "What a great idea!"

Among the seven people lying on the ground, four were players and three were local natives from Arthur's hometown. Killing players would just lead to them being revived, and they might even get a magical item. It's a good deal, after all.

"You're probably adventurers from Earth, right? I've been stuck here for too long, and I have no idea what's been happening outside." Lyra continued, "It's interesting, you see. You have five chances to revive, which makes it even less of a concern."

"Entering here means someone has to die, and I can't break this rule. You don't need to worry about the anger of the three people who will die. I can give you some treasures, and you can distribute them to calm them down."

Zhao Xun gazed at the Lyra mage in front of him, becoming increasingly perplexed.

Lyra had said too much, and Zhao Xun had almost caught a hint.

At this point, Zhao Xun focused on Lyra's attire, "Being stuck here for a long time" reminded him of something. Perhaps the mage Lyra in front of him wasn't as free as he had imagined.

But where was the weakness?

Could he defeat a restricted high-level mage like Lyra? He would have to take a shortcut and go directly to level 9.

Lyra's robe was unfortunately not the same as his own, and it didn't look like the robes he had seen on high-level mages in Floating City. It was only similar. Otherwise, he almost thought that Lyra and himself came from the same source.

Oh well, he would just try some spells carelessly and see what happened. If he really took down the opponent, he would have really gotten away with it.
Zhao Xu directly starts casting the spell, but an information panel suddenly flashes a message - "Adventurer Zhongxia, you can now level up to level 2. Please allocate your skill points and unlearned expertise as soon as possible."
