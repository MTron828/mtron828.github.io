Chapter 380 Ruins Legend
With Vivian's extraordinary sword "Evil-Breaking Slash," everyone was immediately silenced on the spot.
For civilians without combat power, being able to stab a professional wearing leather armor with a sword was already incredibly powerful.
But for other Arthurs or player adventurers, they knew that killing a level one or two adventurer with a single sword was not difficult.
The difficult part was being able to make such a stunning sword strike.
No one present had the confidence to block that sword in the same situation.
This directly made Zhao Xu's next journey much quieter, with fewer flies to disturb him.
As they entered the desolate ruins, the surrounding mist slowly emerged, like thick gauze, cutting off the light in this area.
Even looking up at the sky, it was difficult to see Arthur's huge and extremely hot sun.
At the same time, the ground of the desolate ruins was not like the gravel roads or flat stone surfaces of previous scenes. Although it also had a hard surface for carriages to travel on, the top layer was like a layer of desolate gray soil.
When a large number of people walked on this desolate gray soil, the dust they kicked up deeply suppressed everyone's vision.
At this moment, even without using fog-type spells, Zhao Xu's visible range ahead did not exceed ten meters.
And when night fell, the surroundings became so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, accompanied by occasional wild animal howls.
Even if the civilians wanted to keep moving, at this moment they all obediently set up a simple camp for the night.
Although Vivian, a succubus, usually does not have the habit of camping, this time traveling with Zhao Xu, she deliberately brought camping supplies and quickly set up a tent. At this time, everyone sat around the campfire, silently roasting in the winter. In the darkness, Zhao Xu could barely make out the glimmer of more than ten other campfires, while the further ones were difficult to see due to the thick fog of the ruins. Zhao Xu and Vivian sat side by side at the tent entrance, sheltered from the snowflakes by the canopy. He read the scriptures by the light of the fire, while Vivian used the clean water created by Zhao Xu's "water-making technique" for simple washing. As for the others on the journey, they were not so lucky. After entering the desolate ruins, they could not replenish their water supply, so the water they brought in was precious. Zhao Xu's water-making technique could produce 4 liters of water each time, more than a bucket of water, so there was no problem with drinking water. This was also the reason why Vivian could comfortably wash her hair in a basin, while most of the others looked dusty and exhausted. Several children played recklessly in the ashes, getting dirty and being scolded by their parents. At that moment, the other players who had set up their tent opposite Zhao Xu and the others began to tell ghost stories. They reorganized some common ghost stories from Earth with Arthur's background, and with the backdrop of the bone-chilling snow, they told the stories in a way that made everyone shiver. Zhao Xu had heard most of the stories before and was fine, but it was Vivian who was now listening with interest, even leaving her comb half in her hair and getting completely absorbed in the stories.
The group of people huddled together, watching the beautiful ViViAn and listening carefully to their descriptions, their interest grew even more. At this time, the manager of this caravan, also the steward of the Ailaxi family, the old Mr. Gode, cleared his throat and slowly spoke, "Do you know how this desolate wasteland was formed?"
This question, which concerned their own practical interests, immediately aroused everyone's interest. Several guards eating dry bread and a few caravanners stared at him intently.
After dinner, there weren't many entertainment options for Arthur and his group, so sitting together and boasting to each other was the most common pastime.
They even put out a round of coarse brew beer in front of them, and then brought in an atmosphere master to demonstrate martial arts, making it seem just like a bar on Earth.
Zhao Xu did indeed have his "knowledge and skills" tested initially, and in fact, he had heard the legend of this ruin in his previous life.
"Let me tell you," the steward Gode quietly opened the aluminum can of wine he carried with him, took a sip, and said, "This is the site of a great war after all."
"Tch." Immediately, the surrounding audience made disdainful noises.
Including Zhao Xu, his curiosity plummeted.
In his previous life, he knew about this rumor, and he had even been in close contact with it.
"Hmph." At this point, the steward Gode, sensing everyone's dissatisfaction, immediately emphasized, "What I'm about to say is certainly not that simple."
"The reason this land became a ruin actually involves the gods," the steward Gode said in a hushed voice.
Suddenly, everyone present showed a pensive expression.
"At first, it was said that an immortal strongman blocked a blow from an ancient deity. However, the power of that blow was too immense, and although it was deflected, the energy still seeped into the land beneath our feet."
"This ultimately caused this land to lose its original brilliance, and everything died, as if all life force had been completely drained."
The butler then recounted a legend he had heard at the dining table, word by word.
After his dramatic retelling, everyone's hearts couldn't help but be filled with wonder.
Just the overflow of energy alone turned this vast expanse of land into nothingness.
The terror of that blow back then, to what extent did it reach? If the target had been a town, wouldn't the entire town have been annihilated?
Vivian also showed curiosity, whispering to Zhao Xu, "It's like negative energy overflowing and erasing life. But strangely, we can't feel it now."
Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu also nodded.
It's not uncommon for all life force to be erased in a short time, but the fact that the life force of this land has been erased for who knows how many years is a bit unusual.
In general, in such situations, there must be a continuous overflow of negative energy core nearby.
But Zhao Xu and his group have not been affected by negative energy at all.
"Hey, hey, your explanation doesn't explain why there's this kind of unbearable mist," someone suddenly spoke up, not addressing the question Zhao Xu had in mind, but touching on another aspect.
What exactly is the mist that has lingered for years?
At this moment, the butler, Gode, smiled generously, "I don't know about that, but since I can remember, both the West and the North have organized exploration teams no less than ten times in an attempt to uncover the origins of this desolate wasteland."

The road was chaotic, and they hastily performed the sacrifice, leaving others who hadn't done it to wonder. Without prior preparation, everyone only brought dry rations, so where would there be live poultry?
However, at this moment, Zhao Xu's face was slightly stiff.
"President?"
Vivian keenly noticed this and couldn't help but lean close to Zhao Xu, while her hand went directly to the hilt of the holy avenger behind her.
"What's wrong?"
Zhao Xu listened to Vivian's concerned inquiry, but his expression was somewhat serious, "Sometimes, it's better not to give."
"It's a big problem if what's given is not enough."
"Under a toppled nest, how can there be any unbroken eggs."
Saying this, Zhao Xu looked at the tents that were set up like small hills in the continuous darkness.
"Hey, if you're tired, just go back and sleep." At this time, a woman opposite the campfire leaned over and patted her companion's shoulder. Since just now, the other person had been hanging their head, as if they were asleep.
Who knew that with just a gentle pat,
The poet didn't startle awake, but instead just fell over, their whole body tumbling into the campfire.
The flames instantly spread to the poet's body.
But he never woke up again.
