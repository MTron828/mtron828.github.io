Chapter 611: Seizing the Initiative!

The premise of creating "Aurora Crystal" is to possess a "magic crystal" the size of a fist, which is essentially a "Asterion Crystal" that only records magical models. However, most of the Asterion Crystals obtained by Arthur's surface mining are too small, which is why "Aurora Crystal" has not been widely promoted.

Once this path is cleared by Zhao Xu, it may mean that the entire Arthur region's mages can eliminate the "copying fee" to the extreme.

"Xing Star Mage, what do you think?" asked Zhao Xu, looking at the silent gaze of the surrounding members, who couldn't help but urge him on a few times.

This matter couldn't help but stir up their emotions, as mages are perpetually oscillating between "poverty" and "wealth". On the one hand, they need to spend a large amount of gold coins for magical experimentation and research, and on the other hand, magic is Arthur's productive force, so mages effectively control the production resources. Once they manufacture magical items, they reap a bountiful harvest.

"Indeed, the essence of the magic crystal is Asterion Crystal," Zhao Xu said, looking at the group of excited adventurers.

"That means that if we can find that vein, we can mass-produce 'Aurora Crystal'?" asked the female mage, Fly Su, who couldn't help but clench her fist and become ecstatic, her entire body radiating excitement under the allure of money.

Natalia similarly grasped her hand, as if sharing in this joy.

"Don't get too excited, you guys," said Zhao Xu, feeling that he should clarify the difficulties in the face of this seemingly shared excitement.

"Generally, dragon crystal veins are found in dimly lit, humid areas, such as shallow inner bays of swamps. The original dragon crystal is wrapped in a rock shell. At this moment, Zhao Xu is completely unmoved and continues to consume "lucky points" to add to the mystery knowledge check.

Instantly, all knowledge related to dragon crystals is revealed at the 86th level of knowledge (mystery).

If Arthur had knowledge (physics), Nobel laureates would only have a 40+ skill bonus in this field.

Especially after linking knowledge (geography) skills, the search results would be more extensive.

"The first dragon crystal vein discovered by Arthur is located in the Kova swamp, where the dragon crystal is wrapped in rock. Over time, due to the erosion of warm, bubbly water, the rock has cracked and exposed the dragon crystal.

"The last farmer who passed by happened to see the dragon crystal shining faintly through the cracks on the water's surface and discovered it. However, even in the largest swamp collection area on the west bank of the Mud River, finding dragon crystal rocks is still an extremely difficult task, not to mention mining.

"Only experienced explorers can find them, and the rocks wrapped around the dragon crystal are very hard, making it impossible to extract the dragon crystal like opening an eggshell. Often, mining will cause the internal dragon crystal to break apart."

As Zhao Xu finished speaking, he looked at the crowd as their faces slowly returned to normal, "When collecting in the muddy water at or below waist level, the surroundings are also fraught with danger. The most famous family in the area, the Sakru family, collects one or two blocks of rock crystals per month, and the average yield is dozens of fragments."

In addition to following Zhao Xu's Rose Sisters, most of the others who dared to descend at this time were experienced players with two pairs of brushes, as evident from the various adventure tools on their bodies. Zhao Xu's words were also telling them.

If they really discovered dragon crystals in this underground area, the difficulty of mining would be beyond their imagination.

"Regardless of whether we can mine, we must try our best. This might just be the hope of humanity on Earth," said a warrior player named "勠力," who was also an extremely powerful warrior over level 7 and seemed to possess a strong sense of justice.

Zhao Xu remained non-committal.

This mysterious cave, to exaggerate, might be the boundary of "Arthur's" dimension, situated at the intersection of other planes, such as the "negative energy plane," which was why there were so many undead creatures here.

After he finished speaking, he suddenly established himself as a dragon crystal expert, and from then on, he had the final say on all matters related to dragon crystals.

"According to this, just searching for the portal's exit is a daunting task, and if we're not lucky enough to find a portal on-site, it's unimaginable," said the younger sister, Qing Lu, who rarely spoke up.

At this point, Zhao Xu also gradually realized that the other person was a devout follower of the powerful force "Spider Rear" Ross, a former priest.

"But who has the ability to build a portal in this desolate wasteland now?" the young mage asked in a muddled tone.

Instantly, everyone's gaze converged on Zhao Xu.

The largest portal network in the entire Arthur world was hidden within the Mage Association, but players had only passed through it a few times due to the "mission" reason.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although "the Portal" has spread its fame throughout the player community, Linkeia suddenly asked, "Isn't it said that Starfall Town has been granted permission to build a 'Portal'?" It was clear that her gaze had never left Starfall Town.

If one had to evaluate what kind of magical item the guilds most desire to possess, a "Portal" that can save countless transportation costs and avoid dangers by teleporting, would undoubtedly be at the top of the list.

In a society with limited resources, transportation costs can account for a significant portion of the cost of a commodity. This is also the reason why farmers would rather pour milk down the drain during economic crises, as the cost of transportation would be higher than the selling price of a bottle of milk, making it more profitable to just give it away.

"No, the Portal is a complex magical item. Even someone with a 'Creator of Wonders' specialization and formula cannot manufacture it," said the female wizard, Qingli.

Moreover, the Portal is not just a matter of moving a large door to change the teleportation location. Therefore, the original Portal built at Starfall Town still retains its original location.

For some reason, Qingli, who stood behind Zhao Xu without directly facing the crowd, felt that Linkeia's words had an underlying tone. As a member of the Azure Guild, Qingli had to clarify the situation.

"But it's undeniable that if someone can establish a 'Portal' at a discovered mine site, Zhao Xu would be the only one who can do it," Linkeia said confidently, with Qingli's nodding in agreement.

It was as if they were the official representatives of Zhao Xu at that moment.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, just smiled faintly. When the Goddess moved the entire Starfall Town Wizard's Association to Azure, she also relocated the coordinates.
Here is the translation:

Zhang Xiaosu had exhausted himself, spending a huge amount of time and effort, just to establish a teleportation portal, connecting the "Starfall Town" with the "Barren Death Ground".

However, ironically, they needed to run around, doing nothing, just for the goddess to say something.

During this time, Yang Nian was able to sustain a population of over 50 million people, relying on this teleportation portal to transport materials continuously for 24 hours.

However, the benefit was that Zhang Xiaosu left behind a brand new teleportation portal, hidden in the Barren Death Ground.

If the ore vein could be found, he would also use special methods to directly move the teleportation portal, saving the construction time of several tens of days.

Even more so, he had a "Teleportation Array" scroll in his pocket, combined with the "Magic Constant Technique", which would be a miniature one-way teleportation portal, reducing the carrying capacity, but could be completed in just three rounds of time.

So, Na Liru was still not accurate enough, Yang Nian could actually achieve this, and there were even more ways to do it.

Just in an instant, Zhang Xiaosu's heart tightened.

His powerful listening skills allowed him to perceive the gentle footsteps slowly spreading through the air.

Like a drop of dew that had just fallen, it resonated with a slight echo in his eardrum.

No! Zhang Xiaosu reacted immediately, launching a surprise attack!

However, everyone's expression remained calm, with not a hint of panic.

Only Zhang Xiaosu entered the "Surprise Round"!

After this critical moment of confrontation, the team would only realize the attack had come.

This was a high-level exchange, enough to determine the outcome of life and death.
Here is the translation of the text:

The troops led by Arthur like to use "archer teams" to ambush, which means that after a round of "arrow rain" surprise attack, the attacked team may lose half of its strength and be unable to form a fighting force.

A direct surprise attack can kill the enemy before they even have a chance to engage in a head-on confrontation.

As a result, countless adventurer teams place great emphasis on "surprise" attacks. If both sides simultaneously discover each other, both will be in a state of unpreparedness, and direct confrontation will ensue.

Therefore, skills such as "scouting" and "listening" that can detect enemy forces are considered essential skills, and are also the primary responsibilities of wanderers and rangers.

However, there are some creatures like the Minotaur that are not susceptible to surprise attacks.

Mages also have the "Warning" spell, which can ensure that they respond simultaneously and are not caught off guard.

If Zhao Xiu shouts "enemy attack" and waits for everyone to react, the remote attack phase will be about to begin.

In an instant, Zhao Xiu makes up his mind to take action.

Generally speaking, when two opponents meet at a corner and simultaneously detect each other's enemy forces, without a "time difference" advantage, the one who can react faster will be determined by reaction speed - "first strike"!

This involves many factors, from reaction nerves to physical control, and is a test of who can run faster from the starting line.

In other words, it is a competition between the two sides' agility, with adjustments made to agility and actual performance.

If Zhao Xiu's reaction speed is faster, he can ensure that his instantaneous spell hits the enemy first.

Otherwise, regardless of what happens, he will suffer no loss, but his teammates behind him may not be so lucky - this is where Zhao Xiu is tested.

However, magic is a system that is unreliable.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's agility adjustment reached 8 points, and the original spell combination increased his original instinct by 5 levels, allowing him to react like an ancestor.

Additionally, the concept of "attribute judgment" is essentially the "agility judgment" of "improvisational magic", so Zhao Xu's "improvisational magic" luck points can take effect.

At this moment, Zhao Xu nonchalantly discarded the last 16 luck points to his "first strike" pile.

The next instant, Zhao Xu directly triggered the "intuition" spell - a rare spell that can automatically release when reacting to instinct.

This spell, "foresight", directly amplifies Zhao Xu's 1-20 level reaction performance to 20 levels!

This means that no matter how many times he starts, he can guarantee that each time is his perfect state, with no error or fluctuation.

If the world's neural reflex time had an infinitely small value, then 20 levels would be this infinitely small value!

【Adventure Seeker, your first strike bonus is 39 = 8 (agility) + 5 (performance) + 16 (luck), and your first strike judgment is 39 + 1D20 = 39 + 20 (foresight) = 59】

This means that even if internal reflex nerves do not exceed 39, no matter how perfect the performance, it cannot surpass Zhao Xu's reaction speed!

Moreover, relying on the power of the "foresight" spell, Zhao Xu instantaneously knew the sequence of everyone's next actions!

This is the art of magic, where mages are battling in every dimension that can be calculated!
