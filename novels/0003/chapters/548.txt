Chapter 549: The Imminent World Transformation

After receiving the hefty reward from the underground alliance, Zhao Xu suddenly took an interest in the "bounty hunter" business. However, he was not interested in the financial rewards, but rather in acquiring materials, land, magical tomes, and mysterious items.

As someone who could use his detection skill at any time, he could identify any treasure without exception. Moreover, with the "teleportation" skill, he could reach any destination without any distance limitations. In contrast, ordinary five-ring mages could only use teleportation to reach a destination after waiting for their magic points to recover, which might take a day or two.

Zhao Xu, with his potential points allowing for continuous use, did not have to worry about this constraint. Even when combining his teleportation skill with the higher-level arbitrary door, he could kill off most of the external forces of the Arthurian world with sufficient confidence.

The teleportation skill had a "familiarity level" system, ranging from "very familiar" to "occasionally seen" to "seen once" to "unfamiliar". The corresponding "target accuracy" results were also varied, including "target correct", "target incorrect", "similar region", and "obstacle". Zhao Xu, at present, would usually use his four-ring "investigation" skill to first investigate the details of the destination.

By doing so, he could be considered to have researched the destination, and the target accuracy probability would already be around 94%, with only a 1% chance of encountering an obstacle.

So, Zhao Xu can instantly teleport to and from multiple places within an hour. The power of the law is also at his fingertips, with no restrictions on amplification. In fact, it can be said that the current Zhao Xu is no longer like the traditional wizard of King Arthur, but a superpower holder who can do as he pleases.

Just then, he, who was still attending a meeting at the town hall, might have received a trigger message for a certain seal, and instantly transmitted away. Then, within a few minutes, he returned and continued the meeting, faster than going to the restroom.

No one knew that he had crossed thousands of miles in an instant.

In the following period, Zhao Xu also silently transmitted power to his old friends from his past life, including several attribute books, and distributed them accordingly.

Some "magical equipment" that seemed not too excessive was also implemented through task-oriented means.

As the completion of the "Starfall Wizard's Association" drew near, the people of the town seemed to feel a solemn atmosphere.

Near the mining area of the town, a massive warehouse was mysteriously rebuilt to store supplies, and players and local guards were hired for 24-hour patrols.

Including various assets in the entire northern region, Zhao Xu's assets continued to increase, with various lands and supplies being collected under his name.

Even causing fluctuations in the food prices throughout the entire northern region.

It eventually led to an investigation by the goddess of the harvest temple, and it was only through the intervention of the temple that the issue was settled.

This also prompted Zhao Xu to expand the scope of his food distribution, and the treasure funds received from the six sisters were gradually depleted.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu was still quietly accumulating everything. Even on the forum, players from the northern region had already raised doubts several times, suspecting that there was a powerful force secretly accumulating strength and preparing for war.

Meanwhile, the powerful alliance formed by several top players, including "Shan Yao Jin Bi" (), "Guang Hui Bei Fang" (), and "Joint Commercial Alliance" (), was gradually approaching Zhao Xu, trying to clarify his intentions and negotiate a trade.

At the same time, Zhao Xu was hosting a meeting in the reception room, entertaining high-ranking players from Shan Yao Jin Bi, and discussing a grain trade agreement.

"Mr. Zhong Xia," the leading lady, gently lifted her jade-carved ceramic teacup and took a sip before saying, "You should believe in the strength of Shan Yao Jin Bi."

"As long as we wait until this autumn harvest, we can use our capital manipulation to provide you with the grain you're looking for in the black market at a stable and low price," she said.

This lady was one of the key leaders of Shan Yao Jin Bi, a young woman from a wealthy family who had entered the game by investing in ship goods trading. In just six months, she had expanded her business alliance into a major commercial giant in the northern region.

However, Zhao Xu was aware that the commercial alliance formed by Yang Shi players could also maintain their scale by using the characteristics of "player" to revive and maintain their strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

The players under the merchant guild, who are even more fearless, will take advantage of their excessive exploitation to attract the sympathy of neutral players, who will then join forces to counterattack.

The advantages of "Revival Stones" and "registered accounts" have been fully utilized by players, allowing them to flex their skills within the rules. As a result, the major powers in the north have suddenly realized that their usual methods of dealing with ordinary merchant guilds have lost their effectiveness, especially since players are no longer susceptible to mental control.

This is also the reason why these merchant guilds have been able to quickly develop and avoid being swallowed up by stronger forces. Alternatively, these guilds have also realized the barrier above and have used internet financial methods to rapidly expand their scale.

However, it appears that the natural risks are not small, and if this expansion were to stop, the subsequent consequences could be catastrophic for the entire guild.

Zhao Xu also understands that these guilds can thrive for now, but once they cross over, they will eventually be consumed by the major powers.

Because all players have become living Artesians, just like they will die, and cannot buy their way back into the game. As a result, the methods that the guilds originally relied on have become mere illusions in the scorching sun.

"An Qi'er, my requirements are simple: provide this batch of food before July, and if you can't, I'll find someone else," Zhao Xu said politely.

As for the delivery after crossing over, the food prices in the north have skyrocketed, and the gold coins are another matter. The contract we've made is meaningless.

"However, Mr. Zhong Xia, you also need to understand us," Zhao Xu said. "You need to know that the market has already been drained of a large amount of food over the past few months, and even forced the major powers to open their granaries to stabilize food prices."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If we don't have confidence that we can establish a connection with the upper echelons of power, we won't dare to make any guarantees, and the autumn harvest will definitely provide a certain amount of grain," said An Qi'er, his expression stern as he stood beside two secretaries who were busy sorting through a stack of papers. At the same time, four high-ranking officials, including two from the current player and two local experts, were waiting outside, clearly hired to protect the negotiation.

As for Zhao Xu, he had only brought Zheng Xin-yuan to assist him. Zheng Xin-yuan had been serving as Zhao Xu's personal secretary in addition to her pastoral duties, and was receiving a monthly salary from Zhao Xu.

The conversation between the two parties was being recorded by an "automatic note-taking quill" on the side, and several people couldn't help but glance at the pen as it wrote down the contents of the records.

"Now, Madam An Qi'er, you're asking me to hand over a magic item worth half the value of the grain to balance out the price, and the delivery is being delayed until autumn. Isn't that a bit unreasonable?" Zhao Xu pointed out.

It's undeniable that the model of providing a channel for the two parties to negotiate has indeed brought about many opportunities, which has contributed to the rapid development of the player's guild. However, at this moment, Zhao Xu is facing a stronger negotiator.

"Mr. Zhongxia, according to my intelligence, the magic weapons and magic armor in your possession have not been planned for use before July, and the small town needs to replace its equipment. So, we can transfer them to us first, and you won't lose anything. Moreover, we can offer an additional 5% discount on the grain price."
Here is the translation:

As soon as these words were spoken, Zhao Xu also realized that there must be an insider among the players under his control, which is why he revealed all these messages and let the other side get to the bottom of things.

"Don't bother."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu stood up.

"I have only one sentence to say to you. As long as you can complete the delivery by the time summer arrives, at the current food price, I'll take in as much as you have. As for the remaining commitments, let's just forget about them."

After saying this, Zhao Xu prepared to leave.

"What is it that's causing Mr. Zhongxia to insist on completing these deliveries by July?"

Player Anqi stood up at this time, her originally gentle and elegant demeanor having disappeared for the first time. "It can't be, Mr. Zhongxia, you've received rumors that the Beast Empire next door can cross the Ice Mountain Range and launch an attack?"

"It's already June, and there's only about a month left."

As she spoke, Player Anqi shook her head, even doubting herself.

"No."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's tone paused, his expression calm as he looked at the other side.

"This is a matter that involves both you and me, and a major shift in the era."
