Chapter 613: The Name of the Mage, Summer Solstice

As the mage girl hesitated, her expression revealed doubts. She was not willing to give up the "Olin Crystal" and the "Magical Crystal", which might represent valuable clues to the treasure.

The key question was: was this "Talisman of Life" really a life-or-death situation?

The mage girl's tone was urgent: "We can just abandon these dragon crystals if these undead creatures continue to pursue us. We can reassess our plan later."

"Exactly!" someone agreed.

"It makes sense. We don't have to waste our lives," another person said.

For a moment, everyone was in an uproar, not wanting the mage to sacrifice his life.

At that moment, endless hordes of undead creatures were pouring in from all directions, even iron-hard ones would be overwhelmed and eventually die from exhaustion.

"The current Earth is not tolerant of any high-level player's waste," someone said.

The warrior who initially agreed to give up also said, "If there's a way, we should preserve our lives and not waste them for the sake of a single breath."

The mage girl said, "This plan is feasible."

The three sisters, led by Zhao Xu, also came to comfort the mage girl.

"No," the mage girl refused.

Zhao Xu shook his head: "In this critical moment, three of the paths have been temporarily sealed by me, leaving only two paths. If we abandon the dragon crystals here, it's easy to imagine the situation we'll face."

Although his voice was not loud, his words pierced deep into the hearts of everyone present.

Everyone's face turned white, understanding the implications.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If there are undead creatures in the distant branches that are not yet exhausted, then they must be heading towards this place, so no matter which route the players choose, they are likely to encounter them face-to-face. Alternatively, they will undoubtedly meet.

"Can we use the magic rope of the two rings to create a space to hide?" someone suddenly proposed.

"No, a two-ring spell can accommodate 8 people inside," another wanderer exclaimed with excitement.

In the face of death, everyone clings to every straw. And after arriving at Arthur, they also began to think like Arthur to solve the problem.

However, after the wanderers carefully counted the number of wizards on the scene, they discovered that there were only 5 wizards who could cast this spell, and one person could accommodate 40 people.

The key question is whether they have learned this spell, whether they have prepared, and if not, whether they have scrolls.

At this point, two wizards looked puzzled.

Zhao Xu was not surprised.

He relied on the "final scroll" to bypass the wizards and scroll scholars, the most difficult hurdle - copying spells.

In fact, he could be so powerful at this moment, and a small part of the reason was due to the comprehensive tables of the scroll scholars.

The strength of a scroll scholar does not lie in their dense professional skills.

But rather, it depends on how many "magic tables" they can learn, such as the "pastor's magic table", the "patrol officer's magic table", the "saintly warrior's magic table", the "poet's occult table", the "wizard's occult table", and the "magician's occult table".

The more they learn, the stronger their combat power will become.

Because a scroll-wielding patrol officer and a scroll-wielding saintly warrior are like two towering mountains, and finding magic scrolls and copying spells are the two biggest hurdles for scroll scholars."
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though the mages know that "magical rope" is effective, they might not learn it, mainly due to the high cost of learning. "This isn't my fault," a mage who has not learned said, looking at the disappointed eyes of the crowd. "I used to be able to survive by digging a hole in the ground; I didn't need to find a space to conceal myself."

"Let's take a look at the magical rope scrolls and see if we have any preparedness reports. Let's count the number first," the wanderer said, and the atmosphere in the room grew tense.

The crowd could only take cover by squeezing into a half-meter-wide gap. At the same time, new undead creatures had arrived at the fork in the road, waiting to pass through the force wall and the cave crevices.

This was the tyrannical behavior of the undead creatures, unless they could be blocked by spiritual forces.

Unbeknownst to everyone, Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "This is useless."

"What?" someone asked, curious.

Zhao Xu immediately explained, "The magical rope connects to a different dimension, and its essence will leave a window of one to two meters in size. It's just invisible. Creatures like the giant worm nightshade can break the invisibility at will."

At that moment, everyone suddenly remembered the undead wave from before, where the giant worm with a purple body could swallow a high-level player whole.

"So, using the magical rope is just waiting to die in place," Zhao Xu said quietly, revealing the cruelest truth in the world.

Meanwhile, the undead creatures were slowly squeezing out of the wall at a visible speed.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the dimension of the afterlife, everything around was desolate and empty. This was also a place where immortal beings were extremely terrifying. Only by possessing a method to strike the afterlife from another dimension could one target these immortal beings.

"No time to hesitate," Zhao Xu waved his hand, "hand them over to me. I'll take them on a different path. If I can run fast enough, it's possible that the immortal beings ahead of us on the other path will be lured away."

"Wait," the female pastor, Qing Lu, suddenly spoke up, "I think you, the lone star wizard, mean more to Aina, so let me take these dragon crystals on a different path. As long as I remove my armor, my running speed won't be slow."

Hearing Qing Lu's selfless offer, the few male players around her also stood up, expressing their willingness to take on this responsibility.

Zhao Xu suddenly had a fleeting thought, as if the dragon crystals in his hand were not deadly, but the only chance to survive.

He burst out laughing, "You're all being too enthusiastic. On one hand, I'm confident that I can survive in the encirclement of these immortal beings. On the other hand, I'm also curious about this dragon crystal mine and plan to explore it firsthand."

Zhao Xu said this, and the few people surrounding him took a deep breath.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was holding a dragon crystal and was receiving such treatment, while in the dragon crystal mine nearby, legendary immortal beings were probably scattered everywhere.

"The lone star wizard, it's really not necessary to be so reckless..." Qing Lu couldn't help but grab his sleeve.

Originally, escaping was already a 9-to-1 chance of death, and adding the dragon crystal mine was a 10-to-1 chance of death.

"Don't worry," Zhao Xu joked, "I won't joke about my life. Believe me, if there's anyone in the team who can survive, I'll definitely be one of them."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, the female mage, Fly, also handed over the "dragon crystal" she had just extracted to her. "Solo Star Mage," suddenly Naviya spoke up, "Can you tell me where your family is in Yulan, what their names are, and what their characteristics are?"

The warriors on the side heard this and exclaimed, "No mistake, big brother! If this time is truly irreversible, then we will take care of your parents!" Originally on Earth, taking care of friends' parents was not something that would be easily said, even if said, it would be difficult to believe whether it could be done.

However, at this moment, the players did not have a single doubt. For them, taking care of one or two more people was not a big deal. This was the confidence the players had in the world of Arthus.

"Ah, no need, thank you," Zhao Xu also nodded slightly and took over the dragon crystal package from the female mage, Fly. Then, he looked around and fixed his eyes on the countless undead creatures being blocked by the force wall he had created.

Through the invisible wall, he could see the undead creatures piled up on top of each other, already reaching the ceiling. "You'd better hurry up and leave, this force field won't last for much longer," Zhao Xu said, then turned around and walked away, not looking back, into the completely dark and unrecognizable abyss.

This parting figure also made the female players shed tears, and many emotions that could not be spoken were stirred up. The eyes of the crowd seemed to hide a death god, waving a scythe to harvest the brave warriors who dared to enter.
Here is the translation:

As he walks away quickly, he is destined to encounter the unkillable creatures rushing in from all directions.

Suddenly, looking at him just about to be swallowed by the darkness, the female wizard Qingli suddenly shouted out loud—

"Mr. Wizard, I registered as a wizard in Ayan before, I know there's no one called Lone Star, what's your real name?"
But Zhao Xu didn't stop his footsteps, and it wasn't until his figure completely disappeared into the terrifying darkness that his echo came back—

"Zhongxia."
