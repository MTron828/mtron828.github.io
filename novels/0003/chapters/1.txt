Chapter 002: The Birth of a Legend

Zhao Xu spent a lot of time studying in the afternoon, and all his accounts were linked to his iris scan. Once he logged in, the seller couldn't back out.

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu returned directly to his dormitory.

VR simulation headsets have completely dominated the market in recent years, replacing laptops as the must-have item for college students.

Not to mention that VR headsets can allow people to engage in activities for a few hours while sleeping, leading to a significant surge in sales.

Zhao Xu bought one for the reason that he could utilize his sleep time.

With his mind fully focused on the game content, he finished his meal in just a few mouthfuls and was completely absorbed in the online strategy guide, recalling his past gaming experiences.

By the time it was almost 8 pm, his two friends who liked to play games had already put on their VR headsets and were lying on their beds, completely still.

The roommate who was studying for the exam had gone to the library early in the morning to avoid the gaming atmosphere in the dormitory.

The entire floor was quiet, with everyone early prepared to wait for the game to start.

Zhao Xu jumped onto his single bed and put on his VR headset.

In the past decade, VR headsets have evolved from visual imaging to brain imaging.

Zhao Xu was not unfamiliar with TC's games and quickly logged into the TC game platform and found the game "Arthur" after which he directly started the brain-controlled operation.

After inputting the activation code sent by the seller, Zhao Xu successfully entered the game's startup interface.

At this time, the game had not yet started, and the countdown timer was still displayed.
Here is the translation:

Players who purchased the game for 299 or 599 yuan will have the game activation code automatically input in the verification interface by the system.

Zhao Xu's activation code successfully passed the verification, and he relaxed a bit.

Thinking there was still some time, Zhao Xu opened the account menu and browsed through the reading requirements.

He glanced through it briefly and directly flipped to the last page of the test account terms.

A few seconds later, Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh.

It's no wonder he could still buy an account today, feeling a bit tangled here.

The game "Arthur" is the most annoying thing for players, and that's because of its extremely severe revival punishment.

In Arthur, players will not downgrade when they die.

However, each death will consume one revival stone.

Once the five innate revival stones are used up and the player is not revived by any other means, the game character will truly die.

Players can only re-establish a character once, starting from level 1.

This cruel death penalty has led to a general low level among Arthur players.

Many people have already used up their five binding revival stones before reaching level 2.

What's even more troublesome is that each account can only establish a certain number of characters.

They can establish one character with 28-point assignment, three characters with 22-point assignment, and unlimited characters with 15-point assignment.

Once a player uses up the 28-point assignment opportunity, they can only use the remaining three 22-point assignment and unlimited 15-point assignment to establish characters.

In other words, if you want to establish another 28-point game character, you'll have to pay 299 yuan again.

As for test accounts, it's even more brutal, as they only have one 28-point assignment opportunity.
Here is the translation:

Once a person dies, it is impossible to create a new one. The account will be directly recovered by the system.

Zhao Xù, although his in-game abilities are not particularly outstanding, has never been unfamiliar with the situation of sudden death. With 1 year of gaming experience and 9 years of real-life experience, he is more experienced than many players.

After the whole people crossover, all revival stones were retrieved. As long as he doesn't die more than 5 times within a year, he can revive.

As the countdown timer on the game decreases, Zhao Xù's heart is tightly clenched.

Is it God, or is it dust? It's just been a year.

In the instant the countdown timer reaches zero, Zhao Xù's field of vision is suddenly enveloped by a white light.

"Welcome, esteemed adventurer, to the Creation Hall."

The white light dissipates, revealing a familiar scene before Zhao Xù. He finds himself in a grand palace, with a staircase made of countless crystals leading to the sky. Above the palace, the sky stretches out of sight.

The four sides of the palace are adorned with sculptures of gods, whose gaze is fixed on him.

Unlike the current players who are carefree and indifferent, Zhao Xù quickly lowers his head to the sculptures, expressing his respect.

Only after he has completely lowered his head does he have a moment of bewilderment.

He is no longer in the real world of Azeroth.
