Chapter 443: The Abyss of Decline

"Is this the Domain of Decline?" asked Zhao Xu with a hint of skepticism, "This four-ring technique, 'Higher Domain of Decline', has an evolved version of seven rings, 'Higher Domain of Decline'."

This death-attribute spell can extract the remaining life force from nearby injured biological bodies and use it to enhance oneself. Even if the life value falls below -1 HP, the same effect will be applied.

"There's no mistake," recalled Anniya. "You can get a 2-point strength boost and 1-8 temporary life value increase for each creature you kill. Plus, you can temporarily increase your spellcasting level by one level. This spell can stack up to half the number of times you've cast a spell."

Considering Zhao Xu's current spellcasting level of 14, he can increase his level to 21 directly. Additionally, he can gain 14 points of strength, 7-56 points of temporary life value increase.

With his current close combat abilities, adding 14 points of unnamable strength, he's almost invincible, and it's not an exaggeration to say he's the strongest warrior.

"Teacher, I've considered this spell before," said Zhao Xu, furrowing his brow. "The key issue is where I can find so many living creatures to slaughter, and it also involves issues with our faction."

What's more crucial is that this is a four-ring divine spell, which requires an 8th-level spellcaster to cast.
Here is the translation:

He is now a 7th-level mage (four rings) and a 6th-level divine mage (three rings). "Ah, you won't go to the slaughterhouse to kill chickens and ducks, will you?" Anzhiya offered Zhao Xu a plan to avoid moral dilemmas.

"What about ants and the like?" Zhao Xu asked directly.

"No way, ants won't form a cluster and can't provide the 'life force' needed for the magecraft," Anzhiya explained.

"However, you're able to think of this, which means you've already figured out how to meet the minimum requirements of this magecraft."

"Here," Anzhiya said, handing Zhao Xu a dimensional bag.

"What's this?"

Zhao Xu took the bag from Anzhiya's hand, which had been stretched out from behind the curtain, and examined it carefully. The intricately woven fabric bag was different from the coarse bag given by Wang Qingwei earlier.

"This dimensional bag contains thousands of miniature variant spiders, all of which I've put into a fake death state. They can survive in the bag. Each one averages 2 HP. You can release some of them as offerings every day according to your needs. When you become legendary, you can open a half-plane and establish a spider breeding farm for mass production."

"As for your current ability to cast three-ring divine magic and 'Domain of Decline' is a four-ring divine magic, that's a better solution. For example, I can give you a 'Domain of Decline' staff, and that would solve the problem."

Zhao Xu could only shrug his mouth at this. "Teacher, the problem is that the duration of this spell is level-based, and the staff releases magecraft, but I can't combine magecraft to sustain magic for a long time, which is a specialized skill."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, that's true, you don't have the 3rd-level ability 'Effect Super Magic' as a Super Magic Caster, and you can't combine it with a spell that has already taken effect, such as extending the duration of a spell."

Zhao Xiu had once considered advancing his profession and had chosen the "Super Magic Caster" profession, which allowed him to use Super Magic Specializations at a low cost.

As the most powerful ability of the Super Magic Caster, the "Effect Super Magic" ability can directly apply Super Magic Specializations to a spell that has already taken effect.

Although Zhao Xiu's "Super Magic Control" is not as strong as his, it can still bypass the limitation of not being able to combine specializations with a spell that has already taken effect.

However, Zhao Xiu's focus is not on this.

Before, when Wang Qingwei received the inheritance of the "Super Magic Caster" and discussed it with him, Zhao Xiu had also received the inheritance of the Super Magic Caster and had a deep understanding of it.

"So, you've also advanced in the Super Magic Caster?" he asked.

"Of course, I've advanced, otherwise I wouldn't be at the 34th level of elementary magic and the 34th level of divine magic, and I wouldn't have such powerful advanced skills to choose from," Anzhi replied carelessly.

"But isn't the Super Magic Caster a contradictory profession?" he asked.

The Eight Great Magic Schools are mutually exclusive, and learning a new school means giving up another one, just like losing a leg.

For someone like Anzhi, who has mastered thousands of spells, it's not worth considering.

As for new players, they often choose to specialize in two schools to become a specialized mage, mainly due to a lack of resources, and it's a desperate move to get an extra spell slot.

Since they can't even learn a few spells, they don't need to think too much.

As for the powerful abilities of specialized mages, such as the ability to exchange schools for intuition, that's a different story.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In midsummer, you should carefully think about the original text of the school that specializes in the art of magic. Zhao Xu had already ridden his horse along the forest path, whipping the horse with his whip and controlling its pace with his awkward horse-riding skills.

He furrowed his brow and thought, "After advancing to a magic master, it's impossible to learn the spells of opposing schools."

"Yes, it's not entirely opposed to the opposing school, it's just that I can't learn it anymore. I chose to give up on the opposing school when I advanced to a magic master. This restriction is meaningless to me."

Zhao Xu nodded in understanding, feeling enlightened.

He shouldn't have speculatively guessed how Nina, a prodigy, learned magic.

"So, should I wait until I'm level 8 to consider the 'Domain of Decline'?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No, I'll give it to you," Nina said with a smile.

Zhao Xu noticed that Nina had given him a strange staff again.

As soon as Nina mentioned the staff, Zhao Xu knew that Nina was just teasing him.

The staff was made of sandalwood, engraved with Nina's unique floral design, and featured a beautiful crane's head at the top. Overall, it looked more like a "magical girl transformation device" than a staff.

If he dared to take out this staff during a battle, he would definitely be laughed at.

"Hey, don't laugh," Nina said, as if sensing Zhao Xu's bewilderment, and grew angry: "Wait until you understand its effects, and then ask me again. I won't give you a second one. This is a legendary staff.""
Here is the translation:

"It contains 50 units of energy, allowing you to cast the 'Domain of Decline' and 'Divine Magic' spells that last for 10 rings. These two four-ring spells can be used to cast directly with your wand every morning, and you can use them twice a day, which will last for 25 days."

Zhao Xu's expression turned serious upon hearing the word "25 days", and he asked, "What about after 25 days?"

Anzhi nodded and said, "At that time, you should have reached level 8, and you would have mastered four-ring magic, so you won't need this temporary legendary wand anymore."

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then asked, "If you had become level 8 a day earlier, would you compensate me with 40,000 gold coins a day earlier?"

Anzhi smiled and said, "You're thinking too much."

Zhao Xu opened his mouth to speak again, but Anzhi interrupted him and said, "I can tell you, basically, when you arrive at the Academy, you won't be able to get new notebooks. So, I suggest you work hard to reach level 8 first, and then read the notebook I gave you in May. This way, you can easily break through to level 9."

Zhao Xu snorted and said, "Don't you have a clause that allows you to skip a level? If you skip two levels at once, you'll be a sensation that will shock the world. As for level 8, you won't have any special abilities to speak of, except for the ability to reduce one ring of magical energy. The incantations are also useless and can be discarded. So, just skip it and directly reach level 9."

Anzhi nodded and said, "However, the leader of the Northern Alliance, Tang De, does have a notebook, doesn't he?"
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu directly told him the information he had obtained from Fleuret, and it was basic to him that Tang De had a book. "That book is in Grazzt's hands. Do you have the courage?" Annyon said, mentioning the name of the evil king who had "exchanged" hands with Zhao Xu.

"I... "

Zhao Xu wanted to say something, but couldn't bring himself to continue.

He thought back to the "Sealing War" in the north, where the entire north had suffered heavy casualties. The North Alliance had become the frontline battlefield of the deep-sea evil king. It seemed that there was no coincidence.

However, no one expected that the legendary warrior Tang De, who was so high-ranking, had secretly allied himself with a demon king.

"Don't look at me. Since May gave you a book, I'll see if I can get another one from the North Alliance for you. Then I'll realize that the leader of the alliance has betrayed Arthur's true intentions."
"I naturally don't care about such trivial matters, so I'll leave it to you to uncover the truth, and the reward is that you can enjoy the 25-day Annyon's custom legendary staff in your hand."
Zhao Xu listened, but didn't dare to speak his mind.

He could only use his next-level magic, which would allow him to release it a month earlier. He really regretted spending 1 million gold coins.

However, he was at the peak of his strength, having reached level 9 without any gaps.

In the next few months, he would establish a new wizarding association in the Starfall Town, and this huge project would be a good opportunity to gather all the players.

"That's it, come and sleep for a while, then prepare the four-ring magic you just got, and then let's go to the bottom of Starfall Lake together."
