Chapter 389: Unexpected Encounter
After hearing the strange noise, Zhao Xu and Wei Wei exchanged a glance, both sensing that something was amiss. They soon realized that it was not an earthquake, but rather a heavy and massive creature falling to the ground, causing vibrations.

At that moment, Zhao Xu was already wearing the "Eternal Magician's Armor" and other magical spells, which provided him with sufficient defensive capabilities against physical attacks.

Thinking quickly, Zhao Xu cast the "Tri-Ring Technique" spell, which he had recently solidified. This spell, because it could be dispelled at any time, did not meet the requirements for "sustained" magic. As a result, he used the "Super Magical Control" ability to combine it with the "Spell Delay" specialization. Although there were many options for sustained magic, Zhao Xu considered the practicality and limitations of magic, so he usually only carried a few commonly used sustained magic spells.

Most of his spells were focused on defense, consistent with his philosophy of surviving first and then counterattacking.

However, the "Physical Sacrifice" spell, which allowed his spellcaster level to rise to level 12 (arcane) or 11 (divine), was an exception. Therefore, Zhao Xu would usually use it sustainably.

The duration of the "Tri-Ring Technique" spell, combined with Zhao Xu's spellcaster level, was 2 hours. With the "Spell Delay" specialization, which could double the time, it became 4 hours, although not as extreme as 24 hours. Given the battle tonight, this spell was sufficient.

This spell could be said to be a common technique in the art of magic.
Here is the translation:

On one hand, the duration of the Insight Warfare can increase his spell recognition skills by 5 levels, providing an environmental bonus. Meanwhile, once his own spell recognition level exceeds 5 levels, he can automatically sense within a 30-meter radius whether there is a spell being cast, equipped with a built-in spell radar. From then on, he will no longer be restricted by his reliance on visual and auditory cues to detect spells. If there is a visual effect line between him and the caster, he can also use his spell recognition to determine the type of spell being cast.

However, it is the duration of the Insight Warfare that truly determines its significance. During the duration of the spell, Zhao Xun can instantaneously consume all of the Insight Warfare's abilities, just like his divine footsteps consume energy to enable super-long-distance movement. In exchange, he can freely cast a "spell counter" without wasting the time required for the counter spell.

As a multi-talented caster, Zhao Xun can perform the same counter spell as if he were casting a spell of three rings or lower. Therefore, during the duration of the spell, no one within a 30-meter radius can silently cast a spell to attack him. Additionally, he can also counter spells of three rings or lower, canceling out the opponent's spell.

As a result, after donning the Insight Warfare, Zhao Xun also gained the ability to sense the intentions of the caster, no longer relying solely on his physical senses to detect the presence of spells.

Velia was still in the process of removing her armor, but hurriedly put it back on after a few simple gestures of cooperation from Zhao Xun. The two of them immediately left the tent and stepped out into the open.

Velia's psychological preparation for defense led her to lightly tap her floating mirror shield beside her.
Here is the translation of the text:

The moment the surface was processed to an extreme smoothness, it could reflect like a shield, hovering above Veveian's body, blocking her in front.

Thanks to the "float" ability with a value of "+2", this shield freed Veveian from her own limitations, allowing her to grasp the "Holy Avenger" with both hands with all her might.

With both hands, the damage output increased significantly, more than double the damage output with one hand.

As a result, warriors often have to weigh whether to enhance defense with a shield or directly hold a military weapon to achieve higher damage output.

"It's quite impressive."

At this moment, Zhao Xu walked out of the tent and immediately understood what had just happened.

Under the giant stone where they were standing, two super-giant mutant scorpions and spiders were engaged in a fierce battle, and the recent dull thunderous sound was emitted from their battle.

These biological creatures, characteristic of having no intellectual properties, will hunt and attack nearby biological organisms based on their instincts.

"It's indeed absurd," Zhao Xu exclaimed in amazement.

The mutant scorpions and spiders, originally with a challenge level of only one-quarter, "super small", had evolved to nearly 32 HD and 40 HD, crossing six body types.

Zhao Xu had reached 32 levels, exactly 32 HD, while Veveian, standing beside him, had 6 HD of original demonic powers and added 3 levels of holy warrior, totaling 9 HD.
Here is the translation:

"It can be said that these challenges are around level 11, giant mutant spiders and scorpions with hundreds of life values.

"Can I go rescue them?" Vivian asked, and immediately saw the suffering civilians.

The two giant mutant spiders and scorpions, each over 20 meters long, were fiercely battling each other, searching for an opportunity to strike. Although their target was not the fleeing crowd, their massive bodies, weighing over 10 tons, could crush nearby trees and rocks with a single step.

Even Zhao Xu, who had only glanced at the scene, saw that over ten innocent civilians were injured, crying out in agony as they lay on the ground.

However, more civilians were screaming, desperately dragging their limited belongings away from the scene, holding hands with their family members as they fled.

But their progress was no match for these giant mutants.

The mercenary team, which had hired adventurers with combat abilities, could only move the loaded cargo, but even they were unable to retaliate.

These two level 11 monsters were no longer something that a small team could handle. Even in a large city, without high-level adventurers, it would take a large number of soldiers to form a battle array to repel them.

The fleeing crowd was unable to do so.

Among the civilians, those who had been injured by the giant mutant insects were all crying out for help, with cries for rescue ringing out. However, those who faced these small mutant insects could still rely on their weapons to barely fend them off."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, these gigantic beings, like a multi-story building walking, exude a majestic aura just by standing there.

Although they don't have the innate "fearsome" aura of giant dragons, their mere presence can strike fear into the hearts of ordinary people wielding only wooden sticks.

At this moment, Zhao Xu heard Vi Vi's request.

This is also a requirement of her faction.

One who sees justice but does not act is not a Saint Warrior.

For Zhao Xu, protecting Vi Vi was a higher-level belief in her mind, even suppressing her instinct to attack.

Zhao Xu wasn't going to stop her; he directly told Vi Vi, "Go ahead."

Vi Vi smiled lightly and then gazed into the distance, indulgently activating her class ability, the "Higher Transmission" - also known as the "Error-Free Transmission" - which allowed her to teleport a long distance instantly.

With this ability, she could teleport a distance of over a thousand miles, reappearing on the battlefield below.

Like a mage, this short-distance teleportation was usually achieved through the "Portal" spell.

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked up, gazing at the deep night sky.

After the mass migration of humans, many crises were naturally encountered, with many monsters lurking in the jungle.

Even if the temple sent out priests for protection, it was still a drop in the bucket for the 7 billion humans.

Many innocent civilians on Earth became prey for the monsters, which came and went like the wind, constantly plundering.

This was something Zhao Xu would need to consider in the future.

At that time, only players like Arthur could step forward to protect Earth civilians, although they were numerous. However, with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, they were still insufficient.

Therefore, players could only organize and prioritize protecting their own families.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even the most benevolent and loving pastor cannot block this tendency to protect one's own family.

It was then that the "consensus" among players became the "order" of the new Earthlings.

The power elite slowly completed their transition amidst the attacks of countless monsters.

Although they possessed unimaginable wealth on Earth, they had nothing when they arrived in Avalon, and even with their own clan's immense influence, they were still unable to organize a militia to resist these super-giant monsters.

Only players of the same high level could stop them.

Thousand soldiers are not as good as one general, which is a lesson learned by the blood of the Earth's common people.

At the moment Vivian completed the advanced teleportation technique, she had already appeared in the center of the two super-giant insects.

When Saint Warrior, clad in silver armor, appeared, the nearby civilians couldn't help but burst into cheers and applause.

Her sword was indeed too astonishing, and everyone looked forward to it.
