Chapter 196: The Book of All Laws

As Zhao Xu saw the "Book of All Laws" in front of him, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.

However, he didn't relax for a moment and quickly gave Lakshmi an order in his mind to decide on the spell on the first page of the book.

Instantly, the originally tightly closed artifact "Book of All Laws" opened the first page in front of Zhao Xu.

In an instant, the spell on the first page of the book was injected directly into Zhao Xu's mind, just like in the final scroll space, becoming a spell that he could freely release.

At that moment, "Deep Jail Furnace Demon" was startled by the vibration of the artifact and hesitated for a moment before reacting and raising his hand to release a class of spells. However, Zhao Xu had already released these spells in the scroll space after thousands of trials and tribulations, and he immediately shouted loudly: "Time Stop!"

The heavens and the earth, all things, suddenly lost their color.

The "Deep Jail Furnace Demon" had just lifted its crimson giant claw, which stiffened and did not move. The deep green liquid in its mouth also suspended in mid-air, not falling, and its entire body was engulfed in flames, as if it had been frozen.

The entire altar square became a permanent painting at this moment.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and glanced at the dynamic prompt bar - "Time Stop remaining time: 24S (1/4 circle)"...

According to the memories of the 37 individuals who have possessed the "Thousand Laws Book" and can be traced back to their names, the majority of the content has been verified for its reliability.

Information 1: Each time the "Thousand Laws Book" appears, the number of pages is uncertain, ranging from 23 to 30. Each page of the book records a spell, and only by opening the page can the spell be used.

Information 2: The book cannot be turned manually. When the owner casts a spell from the book, causing a magical fluctuation, the book will automatically turn the page, with a probability of 10-30%.

Information 3: The appearance of magical and divine spells on each page has a 50% chance. According to statistics, the distribution of spell rings on each page is as follows: four rings 5%, five rings 45%, six rings 20%, seven rings 15%, eight rings 10%, and nine rings 5%.

Information 4: The spells on each page can be cast by the owner up to four times a day, but no more than once.

Information 5: The owner cannot stop the book from automatically turning pages, and each time a spell is cast, there is a possibility of turning the page. Once the last page is turned, the "Thousand Laws Book" will automatically disappear, unless the owner stops casting spells.

...Zhao Xu was taken aback to find that the mysterious artifact, the "Thousand Laws Book", which automatically disappears, each page with uncertain magical and divine spells, and page numbers, appeared before him.

Most people who possess the "Thousand Laws Book" are torn between joy and sadness. On the one hand, they have gained additional spellcasting abilities. On the other hand, each spellcasting brings the book closer to disappearance.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, when Luxian takes on the form of the "Tome of Omnipotence," these uncertainties in her eyes are all controllable certainties.

Even this book that was originally closed can be controlled by her, and as long as Zhao Xu uses his magic, it can automatically turn to the next page and then stop at the last page forever.

Moreover, the Tome of Omnipotence appears on average 5% of the time, with a probability of 30 pages or more. In most cases, only one or two ring-like magical arts will appear. However, now that Zhao Xu wants it, every page can be a ring-like magical art.

As a scholar of the ancient arts, Zhao Xu can completely control the magical arts that appear on each page, which means that Zhao Xu can use four magical arts on each page.

Zhao Xu has just controlled Luxian to determine the contents of the first page: time has stopped.

Four turns of time means that Zhao Xu can release four more magical arts before time resumes its flow.

Zhao Xu looked calmly at the "Deep Furnace of Hell" ahead of him, and time had already passed 3 seconds since he thought about it. If he wasted another 3 seconds, the precious moment would be gone.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had no time to spare. As soon as he cast the "Time Stop" spell, Luxian had already controlled the book's page-turning and determined the second magical art according to Zhao Xu's requirements.

Eight-ring magical arts, high-level magical arts immunity!

Zhao Xu was in a hurry to cast the spell, so he directly adopted a defensive strategy as the main strategy.

He looked at the 4 "High-level Magical Arts Immunity" magical arts appearing in his mind and directly consumed one to cast it.

Instantly, a formless defensive magical energy enveloped his entire body, taking on the shape Zhao Xu intended.
Here is the translation of the text:

Higher Immunity to Magic is an advanced version of the Four Rings of Magic Immunity. It can immunize effects of magic below the 8th ring. Each 5-level caster can immunize one spell. The caster of the Book of All Spells is 20-level, so Zhao Xuan can immunize four spells - Seven Ring Curse of the Gods, Three Ring Fireball, and Eight Ring Command, instantly. He considers the spell resistance to be infinite.

However, the spells "Group Monster Control" and "Meteorite Explosion" are 9th-level, and the immunity cannot resist them.

The "Hell Refining Magic" also has a 6th-ring magic "Higher Dispel Magic", which can dispel the immunity on his body if it is successfully cast.

However, Zhao Xuan has no fear now. He has already turned the pages of the Book of All Spells to the third page and is casting spells one by one.

The 8th-ring spell "Mind Barrier" can immunize all magic that detects, influences, or senses thoughts or emotions. It can block all magic that affects the mind and also prevent divination magic from detecting him.

At this moment, even if Zhao Xuan leaves the temple and breaks free from the shielding effect, Lian can no longer use divination magic to locate him.

It is precisely because of this spell that 8th-ring mages have no fear of controlling-type mages.

Zhao Xuan chooses to cast this spell because it immunizes the influence on the mind.

The 9th-ring spell "Group Monster Control" that can immobilize enemies, on the other hand, relies on mental influence and he has successfully immunized another "Hell Refining Magic" 9th-ring spell.
Zhao Xu has no intention of wasting his own abilities. He has a 30-page spellbook and can use his time-stopping spell three more times. Therefore, Zhao Xu will target each type of magic ability of the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" one by one.

His fragile life value and low evasion ability make him vulnerable to any type of magic from his opponent, resulting in instant death. At this time, Zhao Xu begins to solve the "Flowing Star Bomb" spell of the "Deep Prison Refining Demon".

To be honest, the "Flowing Star Bomb" spell is often ridiculed as the shame of the nine-ring system, as its damage and power do not match its status as a nine-ring spell. Therefore, magicians have always tried to strengthen this spell, and the Magician's Association has invested a great deal of effort in improving it.

The "Flowing Star Bomb" spell has a spectacular effect, but in essence, it is just like four fireballs raining down on the enemy, performing a precise long-range attack. If the enemy cannot dodge, they will naturally receive the blunt damage and subsequent explosion damage. If they succeed in dodging, it is equivalent to having four fireballs explode around them.

For the first blunt damage, Zhao Xu will consider using the two-ring spell "Shield of Protection" to defend against it. The spell can completely avoid one attack, so he will not be afraid of being smashed.

As for the remaining damage caused by the "Flowing Star Bomb" exploding on the ground like a fireball, he will directly cast the seven-ring spell "Element Immunity".
He chooses to immunize against fire elemental damage!
Suddenly, all fire element magic, from fireball to "Flowing Star Bomb", becomes ineffective against Zhao Xu in the elemental system.

Considering that the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" has the ability to remove his defensive spells and also has expertise in instantaneous magic, it can instantly cast "Fireball".
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhaoxu took precautions and directly arranged two defensive barriers for the Fireball technique. Even after passing the "Higher Immunity to Magic" barrier, he still had to overcome the "Element Immunity" hurdle. Then, at the fourth round, Zhaoxu continued to cast the fifth-page technique - the sixth-ring technique "True Knowledge"! With the ability to hide from the "Deep Hell Refining Demon" that possessed the ability to hide in plain sight, its opponent's eternal illusion ability also lost effectiveness. As time passed, Zhaoxu smiled slightly at the last second. Eighth-ring technique "Higher Speed Explosion"! The time-stopping effect of the technique had already disappeared. However, entering the era of speed explosion, time began to flow, but extremely slowly. Zhaoxu's Higher Speed Explosion technique gave him an entire round of time! And in this round, he could move, while others were still unable to. That is, he could attack the outside world. At this moment, Zhaoxu looked at the nearly motionless "Refining Hell Demon" and said, "Sorry."
