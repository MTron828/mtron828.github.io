Chapter 456: The Sect of the Sword

"'Although our ages are quite different, I'm sure Ya Yue and her brother will shine brightly in the future,' said the legendary mage, looking at Zhao Xu with mesmerizing eyes. 'Including her brother, they will become the heirs of the Eastern Empire in a few years. You're essentially pre-booking a top-tier monarch as your brother-in-law.'

"'Apart from being the outstanding young people of this generation in the Eastern Empire, they can also rank among the top in the thousand-year history of our nation. A master of the six-ring magic, which I have personally taught, is a powerful ally for you, even in the eyes of the Mistral Kingdom.'

"At this moment, the legendary mage noticed that Zhao Xu's eyes were clear and free of any desire. He thought he had made a mistake in using his powers and changed his tone to continue speaking. 'As for emotional matters, Ya Yue and her brother will be attending the Starry Academy, which is perfect for you to cultivate your relationship.'

"As he spoke, he began to feel moved, as if he had just stabilized the relationship between the Eastern Empire and the Mistral Kingdom.

"'Ah, it's unlikely that you're making this 'Starry Academy' to create a marital alliance for the Arthurian dynasty,' said Zhao Xu, standing on the snowy ice plain like she had been infected by the surrounding environment, her tone dripping with coldness.

"At this moment, the legendary mage seemed to be stabbed by something and almost jumped in surprise."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As a legendary wizard who has been passed down for thousands of years, he seems to be stuck in his youth, both physically and mentally. He seemed to have made a mistake.

At this moment, Saint Warrior Vivian also stepped forward, her gaze piercing as she gazed at Jin Wujun, completely ignoring the fact that he was a legendary wizard, "Mr. Wizard, we will naturally have our historical mission, and it won't be hindered by personal feelings."

"Even if we consider it from the perspective of strategic alliances, the succession struggles in the Eastern Empire over the years have been extremely brutal. I think it would be unwise for him to rashly involve himself in it."

Jin Wujun couldn't help but laugh out loud after hearing this. He had lived for many years and had seen many people, including Saint Warriors like Vivian, who were as hard as steel.

But what surprised him was that she was so bold as to educate him like this, despite knowing that he was a legendary wizard. However, he didn't rush to speak.

He had already noticed Anthenia standing beside him, her expression as cold as ice, as if the frost had begun to thaw in advance. As he gazed at the Saint Warrior dressed in silver armor, his eyes gradually brightened up.

"Could it be... could it be...?" he exclaimed with a sense of urgent excitement.

True Knowledge beneath the surface allows all "transformative" abilities to take effect, unless blessed by divine power, in which case they are unable to escape their forms.

A being with a face as pure as an angel, yet with a body as alluring as a demon, suddenly took shape in his mind.

"Whoosh."

Instantly, Vivian's hand drew out the sacred avenger, and a cold light illuminated the surroundings.

Even in the vast expanse of snow, Vivian's warrior aura, infused with her own Saint Warrior's energy, still radiated a sense of solemnity and invincibility.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Strange things happen every year, but this year is particularly numerous." Winning Xiao shook his head and sighed, completely ignoring the sword in front of him.

"When I read about the past of that demon saint warrior, Elrothys, I've always wanted to use my personal charm to infect and turn another demon, and bring her into the camp of goodness."

"Ah, unfortunately, no matter how many times I've visited the underworld and even sneaked into the palaces of the underworld lords to investigate, I've never found a suitable seed."

"Even though I've had the idea of deepening my communication, it's just been a waste of energy."

At this moment, Winning Xiao recalled the past experience and his face showed a hint of "fear".

This made Zhao Xu look puzzled, and even with his legendary sorcerer's abilities, he wouldn't be this frightened even when facing the strongest demons in the underworld.

Winning Xiao also snapped out of his reverie and looked straight at Vivianna, revealing a noble smile, his teeth shining brightly, preparing to deliver a bewitching declaration.

As for how to design a saint warrior, this legendary sorcerer, who had experienced a thousand years of wind and frost, naturally had his own thoughts.

"This saint warrior lady, we've recently received reports that evil demons have appeared in our Eastern Empire's North Asia region, and someone is performing a wicked ritual, causing countless refugees to flee and lose their way."

Legendary sorcerer Winning Xiao's face turned solemn, his demeanor grave and solemn, "And I'm having a tough time because I don't have a deep understanding of the evil ritual, so I hope I can get your assistance."
Here is the translation of the text:

Seeing Vivian holding the cold iron long sword slightly lowered, he continued to speak in a deep, magnetic voice filled with gravity, saying, "If you, Saint Warrior Miss, can successfully assist me and help us, the Eastern Empire, to overcome this disaster and save countless civilians from the midst of fire and water. As a token of gratitude, I will personally donate a specified relief fund in your name to the noble shrine."

At this moment, Yin Jiaocheng couldn't help but reveal a smug expression on his face.

He wanted to be a "Magical Saint Warrior" and flaunt his abilities, but Anzhi Noya was speechless.

The Magical Saint Warrior before him might have been following them on a mission, but when he encountered a "calamity" that affected the lives of countless people, even a passing Saint Warrior couldn't help but be moved.

However, knowing that he couldn't exhaust his all-out efforts to participate in it would be difficult to convince himself of his inner conviction.

Over the centuries, Saint Warriors have encountered moral dilemmas, and many have directly succumbed to the temptation of evil forces, becoming "Dark Knights".

He felt strange, wondering why Anzhi Noya was looking at him with a mocking glint in her eye, as if she thought he was doing something futile.

Vivian shook her head and categorically refused, saying, "You can entrust the task to local Saint Warriors, and I believe that the shrine also has experts who specialize in demonology."

"As for me, my eternal conviction is to protect and fulfill my duty."

"The sword's power is unmatched, and I will never look back."

As she spoke, the sacred avenger in her hand let out a clear and sharp cry, as if the sword's power was accompanied by the Saint Warrior's determination, making it even sharper.

At this moment, Yin Jiaocheng's face turned pale.

The arrogant looks around him, including the one looking like a naive kid, were all losing their footing.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, how can it be that all the Saint Warriors are not following the script now.

He couldn't help but ask, "Don't you know, Saint Warrior Miss, is it because of your faith that you've become a Saint Warrior, or is it because of your devotion to the gods?"

He suspected that the other party might be a wild Saint Warrior like the ones in the army, so he didn't dare to "donate" the "Temple's Offering" to provoke the other party.

Vivian said calmly, "King Ernest of Aurelia is my master."

Her tone and pace were both very calm, as if she were delivering a eulogy, but it directly made the legendary mage, Weng Jiu, change his expression numerous times.

"Sorry to trouble you," he said, slightly bowing his head in apology.

He then took out a long sword from his scabbard and inserted it into the snow, saying, "This is a spell we've developed recently, which is my apology this time."

His gaze swept over Zhao Xu and An Tiya, as if he was thinking about something, but he couldn't open his mouth.

The legendary mage, Weng Jiu, then disappeared into thin air, leaving behind only his silhouette.

"What?" Zhao Xu was about to ask, unsure what to make of it.

An Tiya walked over silently, picked up the long sword the other party had given him, and examined it for a moment before saying, "This is a +1 Saint Warrior sword."

She couldn't help but mutter to herself, "I've heard about this before, but I didn't expect them to actually succeed."

"Wu Jian's Saint Warrior?" Zhao Xu asked.

An Tiya nodded, "No mistake, 'Saint Warrior' is similar to those 'Decapitation' and 'Ghostly' weapons with magical properties that you used before."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You don't have that kind of magical skill, such as the 'Self-Strengthening Weapon' spell, which can temporarily add a '+1' bonus or a feature worth no more than 5,000 gold coins to equipment."

"No, I've added the 'Indomitable' ability to double the damage of a charge attack before."

"When you're able to cast a four-ringed spell, you'll be able to cast an even stronger 'Strengthening Weapon' spell."

"At that time, you'll be able to add a '+3' bonus or a feature worth no more than 70,000 gold coins."

"This 'Stream' is a low-level bonus effect of '+1', and if you master the Nine Swords system, your attack will increase by one level. If you also use the corresponding flow or posture, it will increase by three levels."

"For example, this '+1' White Swan Flow Long Sword in my hand, when I use the 'Perfect Order Spirit' posture and combine it with the 'Leadership Charge' attack technique, it's equivalent to a +7 level attack."

"Why don't you research this kind of enchantment? It's almost like adding a shield to melee combat."

As soon as Anzetta finished speaking, she directly handed over the sword to Zhao Xiu.

Zhao Xiu suddenly focused his attention and felt the sharpness of the sword in his hand.

According to this, this '+1' Long Sword is equivalent to a '+2' bonus in the eyes of those who practice the Nine Swords. Even if they can't use their attack techniques all the time, the flow and posture techniques they master will maintain for 24 hours, which means that the 'Stream' enchantment can bring a 4-level increase in their hands.

A '+1' Stream Long Sword is worth at least 8,000 gold coins on the market.

However, it can enhance the value of the sword by +1 (weapon strength), +1 (knowledge of martial arts), and +3 (use of posture) to increase the attack value by 5 levels, which is equivalent to a '+5' weapon and worth at least 50,000 gold coins."
Here is the translation of the text:

A normal person wielding a "+5" magical longsword could counter the advantage of wearing half-armor. It's truly a killing weapon. This left Zhao Xu somewhat perplexed. How could he not have seen such enchanted weapons in the previous world's seal-off magical battle? Or perhaps this type of enchantment is still in the stage of small-scale production? If it's leaked, the value would be impossible to estimate. Zhao Xu was essentially holding a prototype of an iPhone that hadn't been mass-produced. Saying it plainly, it's just a mobile phone, but once leaked, it would stir up a huge storm. "Miss Anzuelia, Mr. Win Two Guo, and our lord, do they have any connection?" Vivian was also puzzled. Miss Anzuelia, however, just shook her head. "He's just a silly person who wants to recreate the glorious achievements of the past. He participated in establishing the Eastern Empire and was able to unify Arthur in the end." "The magical empire established by Ernest in the past was only established by scattering the influence of all the kingdoms in Arthur's realm. Even if the gods proclaim faith, they must follow his rules." "If Ernest hadn't disappeared without a trace, Arthur's realm wouldn't have been in chaos until now." Miss Anzuelia spoke softly with a gentle tone. Even in this icy and snowy scene, they couldn't help but reminisce about the "Silent Era" that once made the gods fall silent.
