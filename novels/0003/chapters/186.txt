Chapter 187 - He Doesn't Want to Go

Zhao X첫 and the three others could see that something was off with the stone monument in front of them. They suddenly became calm and composed.

This "sundial" stone monument was not supposed to be here in the first place. The materials used for the staircase were also not consistent with the actual situation.

These two factors had already raised enough suspicions to indicate that something was wrong here.

This time, there were at least hundreds of people searching this area. Zhao X첫 knew that if he found these suspicious points, he could almost go back and report.

The "Deep Furnace of Hell" challenge, level 20, was not something a 3rd-level player like him could challenge.

If he continued to rashly research the stone monument and even found a hidden passage and entered it, he would be more reckless than those five young men and women who had gone missing the night before.

Zhao X첫 began pacing around the stone monument, thinking of calling everyone back.

Suddenly, he saw that the shadow of the stone sundial suddenly moved.

At the same time, there was a "clank" sound, as if something had fallen to the ground, and the strange noise came from the entrance of the fourth-floor staircase.

Considering that there were two smaller stone monuments on the first floor as well...

The faces of the three people turned pale, but they didn't dare to make a move, pretending they hadn't heard the strange noise and the shadow moving.

They suspected that perhaps there was already someone watching them.

Zhao X첫 didn't expect that his three targets would be hit so easily.

But wasn't he the one who hadn't even found the entrance to the secret room or underground city yet? He hadn't even planned to go on an adventure, let alone get involved in something like this.

However, his two magical items declared that they were safe, and now it was time to think about escaping. At this time, Zhao Xu continued to pretend to be indifferent and said, "This sundial seems like we saw it at the museum, don't you think?"

As soon as Zhao Xu spoke, the two women's eyes lit up, and they immediately understood Zhao Xu's intention. However, they couldn't safely walk back down the stairs yet, and they needed to communicate well and make a decision.

"Ah, yes, that's why I recognize it," Esvei said. "Hey, we've been playing games and are really tired. Let's go back and play badminton? I've been practicing a new drop shot, and it's so light and easy to drop, it's hard to defend against."

When Esvei spoke, Zhao Xu let out a sigh of relief.

The three of them had never met in reality, so Esvei's words indicated that she had already understood Zhao Xu's intention. However, the three of them were helpless because as wizards, they could use "linguistic insight" or "cunning language" to understand Arthur's language.

Naturally, this meant that even if they had never learned a language, the devil could use cunning language to understand their communication in earthly languages.

So the three of them needed to be implicit. Players had learned this lesson the hard way, thinking they could discuss how to defeat someone in front of a wizard and have the other person not understand.

However, Zhao Xu had already caught on to Esvei's hint that she was suggesting they had prepared a "drop shot" technique. When they went down the stairs, they would face even greater risks.

So, a safer option was for them to jump from the fifth floor's warning level, use the "drop shot" technique to safely drop down, and then immediately escape.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Feather Fall is a first-level mage spell, which allows a person to become as light as a feather and fall gently to the ground. However, its greatest significance lies in the fact that it is a "free action" spell, which is more convenient and faster than the intuitive action spell, and the intuitive action spell is more convenient than the swift action spell. A mage can cast a spell freely at will within a single turn, which means that Zhao Xun can cast dozens of Feather Fall spells in an instant if he wants to. However, most mages use Feather Fall to combine with trigger spells before mastering intuitive action spells.

It's as if a thought can trigger a spell. In the past, Anzhi Noya had set up a temporary spell called "body transformation" for Zhao Xun, and also set up Feather Fall as one of the starting methods. At this time, Wang Qingshi said with a sweet smile: "Oh, let's go back together then."

She was hinting that she was prepared or had a Feather Fall scroll. Zhao Xun replied: "Oh, I've already learned this skill." He didn't need to worry about whether others were prepared or not.

"By the way, the museum report is due soon, are you guys ready?" Zhao Xun asked, seeking the opinions of the other two, asking if they should hurry up and leave.

"I'm ready, I was about to send it after logging off, or else the teacher will be nagging us," Esveir replied, urging them to hurry up.

"Oh, so you're planning to send the electronic report and paper report just like before?" Wang Qingshi asked.

She was asking if they would take the stairs as usual or use Feather Fall to descend directly. In fact, it was also hinting that there might be surveillance by unknown beings. The three of them had already noticed something strange.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

This is also the reason why they are being cautious up until now. If they take one wrong step, they will lose the three Revival Stones.

Then the three of them can hold hands and come out of the Creation Holy Temple.

At this time, Zhao Xu nodded slightly, "However, before we exchange, I need to confirm the format with you. If it's wrong, I'll send a text message to the teacher first and say I'll be late."

The format being wrong would mean that if they encounter an unexpected situation and get caught.

The text message refers to Zhao Xu using the second-level magic "Wind Message" to send information to Lei An's location.

As a second-level magic, "Wind Message" is a rare and low-level means of long-distance communication. The range of the magic is limited, approximately 1.5 kilometers per caster level, so Zhao Xu can transmit information to a 9-kilometer range, which covers the area of the base camp.

Even if Lei An is not in that location, the "Wind Message" magic will still cover an area of about 3.5 meters in radius and emit a sound, and then disappear like the wind. Someone will hear it.

If they're late, naturally, Zhao Xu wants to tell Lei An that they can't go back.

"Or shall I ask directly and then send the message later?" Zhao Xu asked.

Zhao Xu asked whether they should send the message first and then ask.

As long as Lei An is within the transmission area, it would be possible for him to arrive immediately, even if the "Deep Prison Devil" himself appears. They wouldn't need to pretend.

"Wang Qingwei urged Zhao Xu to give up the idea. If Lei An is not in the transmission area, they would have to wait for someone to notify Lei An. This would take a long time, and in this era of constant change, Lei An would arrive too late to collect their bodies."
Here is the translation of the text:

This is far from the level of the second-class spell "Wind Information" and even farther from the fourth-level divine art and fifth-level arcane art "Short Information". At least that spell can specify to a person.

Last night, I was busy all night, and Zhao Xu didn't even have time to get another gemstone with Lei An, otherwise, he would have shattered it and could have seen the opponent's grand arrival in the next second.

Moreover, Zhao Xu's sudden deployment is also telling the devil who is monitoring them, saying "I know you're there, come out, don't hide, I've already alerted the authorities."

Zhao Xu looked at the two women's expressions and knew that they were all deeply thinking about the pros and cons of their plan.

After some time, Zhao Xu knew that the decision still depended on him personally.

The two women handed over the team leader's position to him, which also meant that they were willing to entrust their lives to him and believed in his choice.

"That's to say..." Zhao Xu was about to speak.

Suddenly, the notebook he had picked up from the sandbank flew out of his pocket and floated above the altar.

The countless torn pages began to reassemble.

"Hu Luo." Zhao Xu shouted loudly, quickly waking up the two women who were still staring at the notebook.

The three of them suddenly rushed towards the fifth-layer railing barrier.

The wall was only waist-high, and even the shortest king, Wang Congwei, could lift one foot and flip over.

At the same time, Zhao Xu also quickly reached the wall and realized that the other two women were roughly the same.

He immediately helped Wang Congwei, who was slowly flipping over the low wall, and himself also used his strength to jump.

Zhao Xu had never felt so weightless before, suspended in mid-air, waiting for gravity to pull him down to the ground 20 meters below.

"Hu Luo".

The three voices, each with a different tone, but in sync, echoed in the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu began to feel an intangible force lifting him up, realizing that the Feather Falling technique was officially activated.

However, he didn't relax his vigilance and continued to prepare to unleash the "Wind Information" technique.

But suddenly, Zhao Xu discovered that he could see the backs of Wang Qingwei and Aiswishi.

The two women were slowly descending in mid-air, with their cloaks fluttering and the hems of their robes being blown by the wind.

How could they not have fallen yet?

Zhao Xu looked back at the stone pedestal with a hesitant expression.

He saw that the notebook on the pedestal was emitting a purple beam of light that fell onto his body.

It was this force that prevented him from falling.

Zhao Xu realized that it was he who had picked up the notebook and awakened the stone pedestal.

Therefore, he, the one who had picked up the notebook, was also unable to escape.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt his entire body floating away, and the familiar sensation of teleportation returned.

He was about to be teleported away!

In an instant.

Zhao Xu's figure disappeared into thin air.

Until the two women landed and turned their heads to look in his direction, but there was no sound of him landing.

When they looked up, the sky was quiet and peaceful.

...

Zhao Xu looked at the dark room in front of him, with a stone pedestal identical to the one on the fifth floor beside it.

He suddenly realized that these two stone pedestals had a directional teleportation effect.

With the notebook in hand, he, the owner of the notebook, directly activated the energy to teleport himself to this mysterious dark place.

Although there were no unusual sounds or sounds around him.

However, Zhao Xu didn't plan to go out and die.
He smiled and directly grasped the "Time Reversal Amulet" in his chest and said, "Go back."
