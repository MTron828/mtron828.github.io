Chapter 615: The Demon King's Device, Land of Life and Death

"'The Founding of the Nine Swords'?"

This name almost made Zhao Xu feel like he couldn't lift his head up.

For someone who had already made up his mind to delay the five-ring divine art and directly switch to the Nine Swords path as a dual elite profession, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of "kneeling to worship" when he saw the old man's appearance. The old man looked exactly like the legendary figure, with an unkempt beard and a strong aura.

"I've read few books, but don't lie to me," Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "I've flipped through the family trees of the various dynasties of the Eastern Empire, from its founding to the present day, and I've never seen anyone named Yīn Bù Fǎi."

He had just seen Yin Er Gou, a strongman of the Eastern Empire, who was of the same generation as the founding fathers. However, he didn't have a "not" in his name.

The old man, with his white beard and mustache, chuckled loudly, "Magic became a system before the establishment of the Magic Empire."

"If the Nine Swords system hadn't undergone centuries of sedimentation, where would the Eastern Empire be?"

The old man, Yin Bù Fǎi, looked at Zhao Xu's face and said, "Even the descendants of the noble families of the Eastern Empire wouldn't have read the entire timeline from start to finish. It seems that you also have the intention of joining our Nine Swords system."

"It's not wrong," Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder as if someone had just offered him a pillow.

It was almost too convenient.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, you have already become a wizard, are you considering the path of "Yu Feng Wizard"? I must remind you that although Yu Feng Wizard is one of the top-notch in the Nine Swords system, it is unable to level up arcane level at 1st and 6th levels, which may not be a cost-effective purchase for those who are one step away from becoming a wizard of the heavens and the earth.

The old man gazed at Zhao Xu with profound eyes.

"Sir, before we discuss the details of the Nine Swords, may I ask a question?" Zhao Xu noticed that he was going around in circles and might be led into the Nine Swords Academy, so he quickly returned to the topic.

"Hmm."

However, the old man shook his head with disdain, "Young people are always so impatient and restless. You should know that in the world, everything is interconnected, and what we discuss may be the same thing. Why can't we see it?"

As he spoke, his hands paused on the thick wooden sword, and a dull, muffled sound echoed through the originally soft mud. Suddenly, the old man's entire body emitted a feeling of "all is one," making it impossible to detect any flaws.

This was the first time Zhao Xu felt a hint of hesitation, as if he should break through from a particular angle if he wanted to attack the old man in front of him.

"It's as if facing a mountain or peering into a deep abyss," he said with a humble tone.

He had realized that this old man was different from the strong warriors he had encountered before.

"What's the question you're asking, and why are you being pursued, and why is there such a large number of undead creatures on this land?" the old man said, completely unconcerned, sitting down on the ground, still holding the wooden sword with his right hand, as if he couldn't relax at all.

"Have you heard of the 'Demon King's Device'?"

After a long silence, the old man reopened his eyes, and his gaze suddenly flashed with electric sparks, penetrating deep into Zhao Xu's heart.

"What is this ability?" Zhao Xu exclaimed in surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

In this fleeting moment, the elder poured all his knowledge about the Devil's device into his brain, and suddenly his brain was flooded with information, just like a mixture of sticky rice gruel. Various concepts burst forth like fireworks exploding in the starry sky.

"So, these are the problems," the elder said, stroking his long beard, "but I also confirmed one thing - your curiosity is extremely strong, very good, very good."

As he spoke, the elder continued to stroke his beard, "This is one of the abilities of the 'Transmission' skill in my hand, which can be used to transmit knowledge to someone else through the 'Enlightenment' method, allowing them to gain a vast amount of knowledge in a short time."

"Similar to our 'Scholar's Touch' spell?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but compare.

The Scholar's Touch was a spell that could convert the contents of a book into a general impression and transmit it to the brain of the recipient. The elder looked at Zhao Xu as if he was being compared to the Scholar's Touch, and suddenly his head spun around, as if he was saying, "It's impossible to carve a rotten wood."

Zhao Xu also quieted down and carefully reviewed the content that the elder had transmitted, one by one.

His face also became somewhat solemn.

Because, this kind of feeling was not the Scholar's Touch, but the "Master of Wisdom" who specialized in it.

However, when Zhao Xu looked at the content about the "Devil's device", he began to show an even more unbelievable expression!

The Devil's device, as its name suggests, was a tool used by the extremely evil Devil King to destroy the world and recreate the grandeur of the apocalypse - a best way to destroy the world. In some sense, this device was not inferior to a divine artifact specifically designed to destroy the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Regardless of the type of magical item, the formula for its creation will inevitably point to a specific spell. As for the Demon King's device, it points to a type of controlled prayer that has undergone a significant change.

At this moment, the opponent is passing on to Zhao Xu a formula for the Demon King's device. If he has 17 levels, he has fulfilled the most critical step.

As for the rest of the expertise in creating strange items, it can be simulated using latent potential.

However, Zhao Xu still furrowed his brow and turned his head to gaze at the surrounding marks, saying, "Look at this introduction. The Demon King's device requires a special manufacturing site, and it may even be a visible region. At least, the raw materials contain more than six-tenths of the name I've never heard of."

"But even if it's successful, it still needs to undergo a long-term test to achieve the strongest effect. And this process also needs to withstand catastrophic failures. Even more exaggerated is that the device requires sufficient knowledge and skills to be checked, not to mention special 'experiences' or 'magics' and 'spiritual powers'."

As Zhao Xu shook his head, he said, "Just these conditions make me feel that creating a Demon King's device is probably more difficult than making a divine artifact for ordinary people. And are you saying that there is a Demon King's device driving these undead souls?"

"It's been told to you, and you can see it yourself," said the old man Weng, not explaining further.

Zhao Xu immediately turned to the last page of the formula and read it quickly.

"The Jade Soul Machine --- using white bones and the flesh of the undead to register, allowing all corpses within a 3-kilometer radius to be controlled by the device's owner as zombies."

"The Soul Aggregation Mirror --- appearing like a large telescope, but after focusing the lens, it can project spiritual energy in a region, similar to causing minor injuries to a group."

Note: The text is a dialogue between two characters, Zhao Xu and an old man named Weng. The conversation is about a mysterious device called the Demon King's device, which is said to have the power to control undead souls. The device requires a special manufacturing site and specific raw materials, and its creation is extremely difficult.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Magic Black Hole - It can cover an area of 5 kilometers in diameter, creating an anti-magic field effect. The construction requirements are at a special convergence point of magical energy."

At first glance, Zhao Xu felt that the cause of this spectral wave and the demon device were inseparable.

Even before the meteorite destroyed the entire 50-kilometer radius of the "Palace of El'goroth" in the Twilight Forest, and afterwards released a field with the same range, both were related to this "demon device".

"Senior, do you mean that there is a 'demon device' hidden in this mysterious cave, and it is the source of the 'spectral wave' that destroyed the entire wasteland?"

"Even say, it is the culprit of this special environment?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu clenched his fists, countless people on Earth having died, not because of the intersection of planes forming a special region, but because of a "human-made" device.

The elder looked at him with a mixture of regret and disappointment, saying, "You're very smart, but not smart enough."

"You should think the other way around - it's this special region that gave birth to the demon device. It's a symbiotic relationship."

Instantly, Zhao Xu's sweat broke out, realizing that he had lost half of the Earth's people in the previous spectral wave, and that the "shadow" of the previous countless spectral waves had suppressed his mood, making him lose his previous transcendence.

"Sage, is the demon device nearby?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this moment, his eyes had burned with a fierce flame, and he quietly took out a scroll case from his waist and tightly grasped a scroll embroidered with black and gold silk. Unlike other magic scrolls written on sheepskin paper, this was a dragon skin scroll, revealing its extraordinary nature.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Archmage Disintegration Technique" Scroll!
At this moment, Zhao Xu is holding a "Tactical Nuclear Warhead", which can trigger a massive, devastating attack that can even make a powerful mage scream in terror.
The old man, who was originally tranquil, shook his head, saying, "These young people nowadays are all carrying around deadly tools that can destroy everything. It's a bit too brutal, don't you think?"
"You know, once this thing is released, it'll be a never-ending situation."
"This is exactly what we need to respond to the current situation, isn't it?" Zhao Xu said, his expression serious.

"But, you need to have enough scrolls to destroy the cave, with 99 magical devices from the Demon King," the old man said, revealing a mysterious smile.

Ninety-nine!

This cold and ruthless number almost made Zhao Xu's consciousness waver.

However, he quickly regained his composure.

Zhao Xu, due to his dual elite profession, had a willpower of 13 layers just from his profession's intention alone.
You know that even a 20th-level mage only provides 12 layers of willpower.
Not to mention the 5-layer Sage's Robe's defensive bonus, the fortune bonus from the 10th-level Treasure Hunter, and the luck bonus from the Ayn Stone (1st-level manifestation) and the One-Ring Faith Spell (5th-level morale), which adds up to 38 layers.

So, at this moment, he had an unyielding determination that surpassed everyone's imagination.
Even if a powerful mage cast a five-ring "Weakness Spell" on Zhao Xu, he would not be affected.

"Why is it so many?" the old man said, looking at the silent Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Not, I'm curious about why you, Old Master, are telling me so many things," Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "Especially these newly acquired knowledge, if I exaggerate, I can recreate this Devil's device."

"It's said that one must have a reason to give gifts, and you, Old Master, are indeed a passionate person, aren't you?" 

He thought to himself, "Ah, yes, that's true."

At this moment, the old man suddenly stood up, looking at the stone walls around him with a stern expression, and shouted, "Why didn't I know this when I was young?"

His entire body seemed to swell with energy, as if the withered skeleton-like figure concealed an endless force.

"I'm telling you these things mainly because you're about to die, or almost dead."

The old man's words were devoid of emotion, as if the passage of time had shattered the vast expanse.

"These 99 Devil's devices filled with death and killing are all made by me, another me, a mage."

"But as the master of the Nine Swords Sect, I created the 100th Devil's device, but it's used to confine me."

The old man looked at the dusty yellow soil, as if the dust was floating in the air. "The driving force of the Devil's device is the dragon crystal vein deep in the earth, and my device is a fundamental absorption. Therefore, when the dragon crystal appears near you, you will be automatically attracted and complete the cycle of the dragon crystal."

"You've been attracted to this place, so you can't leave. This place is used to confine me, and as a mage, you have no hope of breaking free."

The old man shook his head and said, "And even more terrifying is that when the other me awakens, he will use you, so I must kill you first to consider the world. Let this land swallow you up."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You think about the cause and effect before you die, and you feel that your death is valuable and you've made a contribution to the world, right?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu Yue's expression changed, and he couldn't believe that the old man had decided his life and death with just a few words.

Just as the old man was about to swing his wooden sword, Zhao Xu Yue felt his heart racing, and he quickly said, "Sir, your mind is confused, and I can use the 'memory spell' to correct you."

But the old man just shook his head, holding his wooden staff, and walked towards him. "The other me is the legendary wizard, and you think he won't know such a childish spell? But he still hasn't been able to erase my thoughts."

"Don't worry, you won't feel pain. Besides, you're related to An Jia Tou, so I won't let you suffer."

"You can just eat this eight-section white crane fist and fall unconscious."

Zhao Xu Yue quickly defended himself, "You have the power of iron will, that's different."

Just then, the old man's footstep stopped, and he said, "Did An Tiya tell you? It's really annoying, I forgot that I had sworn not to leak the secret. The Ernest lineage considers their oaths as mere farting."

"Wait!"

At this moment, Zhao Xu Yue shouted.

Because, at the moment the old man swung his sword, he felt the power of the "Anti-Magic Field" suppressing him again.

His original "Frosty Touch", "Swift Explosion", and "Explosive Ball" spells, which he had been preparing to use, suddenly lost their effectiveness.

"By the way, I'll tell you one more thing. The rule here is that as soon as you think about casting a spell, you'll be bound by magic."

"You know the secret of 'Iron Will Power'? Let's both be buried in the mud."

(Note: This translation is in Simplified Chinese characters, as per your request.)
The old man suddenly changed his technique. "Break the dragon's claw!" Instantly, the shadow of the wooden sword rushed towards Zhao Xu's forehead. "This is what the final scroll has told me," he said. The wooden sword hovered in mid-air.
