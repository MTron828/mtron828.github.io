Chapter 164: The Legendary Library
After Zhao Xu and An Ti Nuo Ya explained the entire process of mastering the advanced abilities, Zhao Xu especially emphasized the oath he swore to "Magic Origin", which was till death.

An Ti Nuo Ya didn't say much, only opening a "Borrowing Proof" on the desk and letting Zhao Xu figure it out himself.

The next day, Zhao Xu recovered his magical position and took the "Borrowing Proof" given by An Ti Nuo Ya, starting his journey to the destination recorded on the "Borrowing Proof", which was the "Legendary Library".

Unlike the Knowledge Library, where one could enrich and improve their knowledge and skills, the "Legendary Library" had no records at all.

Zhao Xu flipped through the beginner's guide to magic, which recorded the locations of most buildings in the Floating City, including the core area "Truth Hall" and the tower in the corner of the city, which only had a simple name and a warning mark indicating extreme danger.

However, the "Legendary Library" seemed to not exist at all.

Zhao Xu followed the route he remembered and spent about 20 minutes before finally reaching the location indicated by the "Borrowing Proof" - the Knowledge Library.

The Knowledge Library occupied a vast area, and Zhao Xu had already borrowed books from the lower two floors before. The higher floors were inaccessible to him with his current knowledge and skills. However, this time, the "Borrowing Proof" pointed to the 10th floor of the Knowledge Library, and Zhao Xu used the library's alchemy elevator for the first time.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the gate opened, Zhao Xu took a step forward and walked into the room. Just as he was about to press the button for the highest floor, the tenth floor, his hand suddenly stopped.

There is no tenth floor!

Zhao Xu took out the proof again and looked at it. Although the calligraphy on the sheepskin paper was elegant, it was also very clear, and it was indeed the tenth floor. Zhao Xu sighed, feeling a sense of pressure.

Since his last experience of disappearing in the 101st classroom, he had realized one thing.

Anywhere that An Ti Nuo Ya didn't take him to, usually had obstacles waiting for him.

However, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate too much and pressed the button for the ninth floor on the copper-plated numerical button - nine.

As the elevator creaked and groaned, accompanied by the sound of the gears moving, Zhao Xu felt a slight sense of weightlessness as he slowly ascended.

He took out the "New Mage Handbook" and began to flip through it, stopping at the page introducing the knowledge library.

Zhao Xu looked at the contents of each floor's records and furrowed his brow.

"Clunk." The elevator slowly entered the ninth floor's space, and the gate slowly opened after touching the mechanism.

Zhao Xu walked out directly.

In front of him was a row of thick wooden bookshelves, with mysterious tomes neatly stacked on top of each other.

The only strange thing was that the tomes had a thick layer of dust on them, as if no one had touched them for decades.

Additionally, each tome had an extra metal frame attached to the book cover, with a lock on the opening seam.

Every mysterious tome in this layer was locked.

This floor was completely different from the ones below, with no front desk for borrowing and reviewing books.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu walked out of the elevator, the gates of the elevator slowly closed. At the same time, the ninth-floor golden button on the ninth floor also disappeared as if it had been directly erased.

Zhao Xu looked at the small notebook in his hand, his expression serious, and then put it back in his backpack.

The notebook recorded that there were eight floors in the Academic Library.

He wondered how the ninth floor, which had suddenly appeared, came to be. Zhao Xu also noticed that the text on the borrowing certificate written by An Ti Nuo Ya was fading away, as if it had been used.

Zhao Xu immediately took precautions and began to think about his current situation.

The layer in front of him, was it just a virtual ninth floor or the tenth layer, a clue to the legendary library? The only thing he could confirm was that he could only reach this seemingly abandoned layer through the borrowing certificate given by An Ti Nuo Ya.

Zhao Xu even suspected that others entering the elevator might not be able to see the ninth-floor golden button, otherwise, this notebook would have been questioned long ago.

After casting a "protection against evil" spell on himself, Zhao Xu walked forward.

With his star-studded cloak, he was not too worried about close-range attacks.

A few steps later, Zhao Xu approached the first row of bookshelves and took down a locked book.

He forced his way over the metal frame and identified the book title - "Evil Ritual: Feast of the Undead". The cover illustration showed a group of skeletons with eerie red glow dancing around a bonfire, with a startled-looking adventurer above the fire.

Zhao Xu put the book back and took down another book next to it, carefully examining the title - "Stealing Immortality, One Hundred Ways of Pain".
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly scanned the shelves, his eyes glancing over titles such as "The Witch's Sacrifice", "Ten Forbidden Rituals of the Wilderness", "The Witch's Coffin", "Blood Curse, Family", and "How to Become an Evil Being". Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, looking at the books that were not even decent.

He thought to himself and walked to the second shelf. After browsing, he went to the third shelf. Finally, Zhao Xu began to understand.

This layer was a forbidden library, filled with various evil rituals and curses.

Zhao Xu knew that there were evil spells in the art of magic, but the books he saw were even more primitive and brutal. It was as if they had been left over from ancient times.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed. On the right side of the shelf, there was a rusty key hung on a wooden board. Zhao Xu took the key and examined it, finding that the key's handle was shaped like different skulls and evil beings. The skulls were also engraved with intricate carvings. Zhao Xu picked up the largest key and read the engraving, "The Construction of Infernal Beings".

At that moment, he realized that the key was actually the key to one of the books on the shelf. The book's cover depicted an unnamed, horrific creature, which made Zhao Xu feel disgusted.

This meant that the keys were the corresponding keys to the book's framework.

Zhao Xu took out the book "The Construction of Infernal Beings", which was thick, about half a fist long. He looked at the key's structure and the lock hole in the book's center, and it matched perfectly.

Zhao Xu gently inserted the key into the lock and turned it. "Click." The lock opened. However, Zhao Xu immediately turned it back and locked the lock again.
Here is the translation:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt a vibration in the book he was holding.

However, he didn't show the slightest surprise and directly put the book back in its original position.

"Ah, young man, you are indeed very cautious," a hoarse voice came from behind Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu almost jumped in fright and turned around to prepare a spell.

However, he quickly regained his composure and turned around to look at the old wizard, who was leaning on a cane and hunched over, his eyes dull and murky, as if he were about to rot.

Unlike the old wizards Zhao Xu had seen before, who were still vigorous and full of vitality despite their age.

"What's your name?" Zhao Xu asked, secretly preparing to take out his defensive magic wand.

"Don't worry, I really want to talk to you, and the thing you have in your backpack is untouchable."

The old wizard said, coughing slightly.

"How do you know I'm going to take something out?" Zhao Xu asked, surprised.

"Your movements and demeanor are too obvious," the old wizard said with a smile, but his skin was already dry and wrinkled, and his laughter sounded a bit hoarse.

After hearing this, Zhao Xu relaxed a bit.

He nodded slightly and thought that he should correct his unnecessary habits of movement, otherwise he would be caught off guard by the wizards' ability to read people's expressions.

"Let me introduce myself first," the old wizard said. "I am the guardian of this 'Abandoned Library'."

Abandoned Library?
Guardian?

Zhao Xu suddenly noticed the strange part of what the old wizard had said, but he still maintained his patience.

At that moment, the only sound in the library was the echo of their two voices, which seemed a bit eerie.
Here is the translation:

"A little curious? Why isn't it the forbidden library you had in mind? But instead, it's abandoned?"

The old wizard looked back and gazed into the distance at the library that stretched for over a hundred meters, filled with countless bookshelves. "Because the books here are all outdated things."

Zhaoxu began to understand at this point.

Logically, the more evil and terrifying things, the more people would come to read them.

Zhaoxu wasn't interested in some ways that required sacrificing others to gain power for others.

However, some people found the forbidden rituals and magic themselves to be fascinating.

So, this layer had no living people, but it was somehow strange.

"These books record many ancient rituals, many of which have already become ineffective. The original problems weren't that big. The main issue is that these books have some kind of cursed effect, which affects the reader, so they're all stored here, waiting for the passage of time to abandon them."

The old wizard reminisced.

"Ah, really, it's interesting. You, a 3rd-level mage, want to go to the legendary library."

The old wizard couldn't help but burst into laughter, making Zhaoxu worry about the other person.

Suddenly, the old wizard's laughter stopped, and he looked at Zhaoxu. "The entrance to the legendary library is in one of the books here."
