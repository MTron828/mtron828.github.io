Chapter 372: Super Magical Storm

It's obvious that An Ti Noya wouldn't intentionally prepare a spell like this, so she's also using special means to spontaneously cast any spell, just like Zhao Xu.

As Zhao Xu saw this scene, he directly chose an option.

His "Spell Upgrade" specialization was quietly enveloped by the chaotic power, and then began to subtly twist and change.

Finally, a brand new "Yuan Ye Specialization" was formed, but Zhao Xu didn't bother to pay attention to it.

Wrapped in the power of the deep abyss, Zhao Xu looked a bit ferocious, with a bit more exposed and flaunting.

At this time, An Ti Noya didn't cast the remaining spell again.

She slowly stopped and stood still in the narrow, endless, dark green forest path, with not a single beast cry or insect buzz.

The only thing that remained was the synchronized heartbeats of the two.

"What new specialization will you choose next?" she said jokingly.

"If you've been slacking off and not thoroughly studying specializations all this time, I'll just leave you here and let some old hags come and keep you company," An Ti Noya teased.

Zhao Xu didn't bother to correct his teacher's childish psychology at this time, saying, "Magic dual, magic extreme, magic effective are all prepared beforehand."

Heaven knows why Zhao Xu chose the "Spell Upgrade" specialization, which is actually weaker than before.

At this moment, An Ti Noya also showed a praising expression. It's undeniable that after Zhao Xu obtained the "Super Magical Control" ability, with each additional super magical specialization, his own strength increased exponentially.
"What type of attack spells have you been using recently?" Antinoya asked.
"Chill Touch," Zhao Xu replied directly.
Antinoya smiled at his response.
Chill Touch can cause 3-18 (3D6) dexterity damage.
Paired with the spell Twinning at the cost of four rings, that would be 6-36 (3D6+3D6) dexterity damage, with an expected value of 21 points.
Paired with the spell Extreme at the cost of three rings, that would be 18 points of dexterity damage.
Paired with the spell Intense at the cost of two rings, that would be 9-27 (3D6*1.5) dexterity damage, with an expected value of 16 points.
"Then let's go with Twinning," Antinoya suggested.
In Zhao Xu's case, considering the number of rings is almost unnecessary, the numerical model enhancement effect of Twinning is stronger.
"Yeah, and it's more useful to pass two saves," Zhao Xu analyzed as well.
Compared to simple numerical enhancement, even if it's just a simple spell effect, if Zhao Xu pairs it with the "Twinning" effect, the opponent would have to pass the save twice, undoubtedly increasing the difficulty.
Even dispelling magic would have to be done twice in one go.
After seeing that Zhao Xu had made his decision, Antinoya also raised her hand and cast another corresponding spell on himâ€”
Abandon Chaos!
[Adventurer Zhong Xia, do you voluntarily accept the eighth-level spell "Abandon Chaos," and gain the satisfied condition of the expertise, losing the Abyssal lineage expertise.]
Zhao Xu immediately chose to accept, and at the same time, he began to meditate on the process of learning his expertise.
Slowly, the power of the Abyss, bit by bit, was being drawn away from him.
His Abyssal lineage expertise also lost its original color, falling into nothingness and starting to transform into a brand new appearance.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Adventurer, you have obtained the 'Twin Magic' specialization. With this dynamic panel's prompt, Zhao Xiu's originally calm heart finally relaxed. If he directly gave him a "Magic Upgrade", it would be extremely embarrassing.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu also silently felt the pulse of this new specialization, although it could only be applied twice to the same target. Unlike "Magic Chain", it couldn't cast a spell on multiple people at the same time.

However, the repeated stacking and the need to roll twice for avoidance made it have enough value.

The only thing that stopped most people was the four-ringed cost. Otherwise, no one would choose a weak spell over an extremely effective one.

"Satisfied?" Anxinyao looked at Zhao Xiu, who had already calmed down.

"That's definitely the case."

Even if ordinary people had this channel, it was still the cost of two eight-ringed spells. Arthur chose his specialization and directly consumed his own essence, even if he wouldn't use the corresponding specialization again, he wouldn't get his essence back.

So Zhao Xiu had eaten the "regret medicine" that ordinary people might not dare to take, and his heart was naturally very comfortable.

Unfortunately, it wasn't his own magic, so he couldn't switch specializations every day.

"Satisfied, then let's get on and see how to convince the other side to stop," Anxinyao said, finally mentioning the day's business with Zhao Xiu.

"Several old witches, are they not going to make the teacher move?" Zhao Xiu's mind had finally cleared up, and he began to think calmly about the strange thing he had felt at the beginning.

But Anxinyao just shook her head helplessly, "It's not something that can be easily let go of."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The moment she started, she just turned some deceased women into old hags and let them go back to take revenge. That's all she did. She didn't take them back after they had fulfilled their revenge."

"If that's the case, a few level 11 old hags won't have any significant impact on the safety of Mistral, and the trouble caused by the mages is already overwhelming."

"As for her identity and status, she created some legendary monsters, and that's it."

"Ah, teacher, do you want her to stop?" Zhao Xu noticed something was off.

"Yes, yesterday a Paladin of the Holy Order burst into Mistral," Anxinyo said calmly.

A Paladin of the Holy Order?

Zhao Xu didn't notice anything unusual at first. A Paladin of the Holy Order is a legendary figure known for upholding justice and order, born to protect the people and uphold the law. They are revered by the masses.

However, this is a betrayal of their initial intention, and they will lose most of their abilities. Therefore, even if the Paladin is from another realm, we should just send them away. The gods will also leave a small gift behind, and they will participate in some rituals and exchange visits.

"But the problem is that the Paladin is a demon." Anxinyo said with a bad temper.

A demon Paladin.

Zhao Xu couldn't believe it. They used to chat casually with their friends in their previous life, and now this concept has come true in this life.

The question is, what's the balance between the two sides?

"The balance is between good and evil, between order and chaos."

"Let's go. I'll be representing the Mage Association to ask for the other side's opinion." Anxinyo said seriously.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xu also understood the gravity of the consequences.

He was a follower of the "Great Emperor Ernest" who once existed.

As for the holy warriors, they were forged by the sacred power and were not necessarily bound to a specific deity. They could dedicate themselves to justice, and as a result, receive the blessings of the forces of order and goodness.

However, not all holy warriors had faith. After all, only by leaning on the big tree could they survive in this profession that was despised by so many people.

The temple's cultivation rate of holy warriors was also higher, and many people who encountered holy warriors had faith.

This would lead people to wonder: did the holy warriors cultivated by the "Great Emperor Ernest" have faith in who?

It was equivalent to forcibly altering someone's nature by converting a demon into a holy warrior.

Zhao Xu had also seen records of mages doing the same thing, but most of them were used as experimental subjects and ultimately perished. It was impossible to solidify the results.

The evil from the fragments of the soul was not something that could be easily cleared.

Not to mention that demons had to go through the threshold of "chaos" to reach "order".

"However, teacher, adding one more holy warrior won't really boost our strength," Zhao Xu wondered why the powerful existence was doing something so obvious.

If this method could be promoted, the Abyss would be dug up tomorrow.

"She's probably just dreaming of bringing Ernest back, and maybe she's just preparing a warm bed for her master," Zhao Xu thought, lost in thought.

Just as Zhao Xu was daydreaming, he suddenly noticed that Anzelya's footsteps had stopped.
Here is the translation of the text:

As they stopped in front of a mysterious cave that didn't seem to have any special features, Zhao Xu was surprised by this unexpected turn of events.

The other party was hiding in a mysterious cave, but didn't use magical methods to create a residential area, which was a bit unexpected for Zhao Xu.

"This is her nature, a thrifty woman who likes to learn from giant dragons, hiding in their nests," An Ti Noya said near the destination, with a hint of sarcasm.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu noticed that the entrance of the cave was flashing with mysterious light, as if a black sky was embedded with hidden gemstones.

A mysterious energy storm swept through the area.

Zhao Xu had already judged the mysterious phenomenon ahead.

What was that existence blocking their way?

Zhao Xu turned back to look at An Ti Noya, waiting for instructions.

"You go ahead and enter the middle of that energy cluster," he said.

But An Ti Noya replied, "Hmm?"

Zhao Xu, despite his slight bewilderment, didn't stop his footsteps.

"This is a super magical storm," he said.

"It can grant someone a super magical specialization, effective for a year, so take this reward," An Ti Noya added.

"But, teacher, aren't we here to stop someone?" Zhao Xu asked for the first time, surprised that the reward was being handed out at the doorstep, something he had never seen before.

"This is a reward, don't be stingy," An Ti Noya said, looking very satisfied with herself.
