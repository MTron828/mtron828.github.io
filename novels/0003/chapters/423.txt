Chapter 424: Live Broadcast

"'Refined products: fine sword, refined composite longbow, middle-grade injury healing potion, stealth potion, mage armor scroll, dark magic scroll, and stealth potion...'

Indeed, they could take away their small team with a necklace worth several thousand gold coins. The reserve of magical items they possessed was already rich.

Just counting the potions and scrolls, Zhao Xu had counted a lot. As for the weapons, they were all refined products worth at least 300 gold coins. Although they had no magical effects, they were equivalent to "+1" level magic weapons in terms of attack and defense.

As for items like the fireball necklace, Zhao Xu didn't get many, but he got some like the shield pin and Elora's quiver, with prices mostly above 5000 gold coins.

After Zhao Xu and Vi Vi sorted and packed their spoils, they activated the stone door and directly confronted the four medium-sized elemental creatures that appeared from the four corners.

This time, the two of them controlled the tempo and killed the enemies smoothly.

Immediately, the stone door in front of them slowly rose, revealing the third stone room with the large-scale elements.

Zhao Xu, however, just glanced back at the fallen teammates behind him and walked straight into the next stage.

From the elemental symbols appearing on the enemy team just now, Zhao Xu also inferred that at least in front of him, he would not encounter other adventurer teams.

From then on, with the large-scale elemental creatures starting to appear, Zhao Xu and Vi Vi began to slow down their pace, first setting up safety measures and then carefully plotting against the enemies."
Here is the translation of the text:

From this point on, once the timing is off and all enemies are not killed, their tolerance will drop dramatically. Therefore, Zhao Xu and Wei Wei's strategy speed will also begin to slow down. However, the bronze box in Zhao Xu's hand continues to absorb elemental symbols without stopping. It's just that Zhao Xu and his team are making rapid progress. Meanwhile, in this Aizhou Palace, other teams are like hell on earth. Suspicion and conflict fill every door. Countless small teams that have managed to sneak in are now fighting each other, as if the only way to obtain the ultimate artifact is through this means.

Here, the space is sealed off and has no communication with the outside world. Many teams that are short on supplies have become trapped in a desperate situation, struggling to survive. Without the ability to conjure water and food, some teams that are brave enough to enter the explosion zone before the demon's lair may abandon their search and remain in the great hall to reduce their consumption. As for the 12 stone doors, only teams with players can obtain true or false information through the forum. Other teams that don't have a priest with a ring level above two, or those who don't know the secrets of divination, are like blind flies, randomly crashing into fake seals. In the end, they will encounter an unpassable, endless adventure.

On the second day after the Aizhou Palace was opened, hundreds of adventurers who entered the area suddenly died or were severely injured. The announcement that repeatedly changes the name and repeats the phrase "Adventurer XXX, deceased" seems like an unfeeling death knell, constantly reminding those who are still searching for clues in the explosion zone.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As the six hours of time elapsed, the Aizhuo Palace sank into the blast crater and lost track of its whereabouts. However, the existence of the 50-kilometer radius anti-magic field hindered most powerful adventurers from intervening. Currently, the Northern Alliance has dispatched a large number of regular troops to search for survivors in the blast area.

Other adventurers were also persuaded to leave the area, except for a few who tried to sneak in. Most of the remaining survivors were players who possessed Revival Stones and were not afraid of death, who came to the blast area to prove their bravery.

These players were also among the recipients of the death notice. The Aizhuo Palace death list was organized through their memories and was posted on the forum. The forum's popularity was maintained through continuous updates.

However, as the news of the divine artifacts spread, although many shrines remained silent, many professional guilds also did not take any rash actions. However, certain civil organizations, especially some powerful labor unions, learned that it would take at least six days to obtain the divine artifacts.

Secretly, the flow of information was already beginning to turn over, with countless secret plans being transmitted.

...At this time, some players with certain permissions within these guild organizations began to argue about this on the forum.

【It has been confirmed that the guild will dispatch a team of powerful adventurers with an average level of at least 10 levels in five days to the center of the blast area.】
【What's the point of this?】
Here is the translation:

After consulting with the experts, it is estimated that the "Ai Zhu" palace will appear within six days at the earliest. At that time, it is possible that the "Zhong Xia" will bring out the sacred artifact.

Hey, do you think that Zhong Xia can sell the sacred artifact to me for 10 million yuan?

A player who often posts help requests in the forum replied.

You're thinking of Peach, right? With the sacred artifact, the player can sell it for over 1,000,000 gold coins. You can calculate the current black market gold coin price yourself.

Another player who specializes in trading replied.

This can't be calculated like that. Maybe Zhong Xia has the sacred artifact and directly affects the current high gold coin market price.

Haha, you can keep dreaming.

Idiot studio, you're talking nonsense.

The topic gradually shifted from both parties insulting each other to asking about each other's family health.

South Xiaoyu felt a bit cold and directly deleted the post without saying a word.

At this moment, her gaze couldn't help but turn to the half-closed bedroom door, where Zhao Xu was lying on the bed, wearing a brain helmet, and strategizing the "Ai Zhu" palace.

For the past two days, she had been taking notes and searching online for secrets about other gates in the "Ai Zhu" palace, preparing to send them to Zhao Xu later.

Until now, the "Ai Zhu" palace still only maintained the record of Zhao Xu breaking one seal.

Originally, some people looked down on Zhong Xia, thinking he got lucky. After the specific information about the gates was exposed, those posts were all slapped in the face.

Even when the message about the "legendary monster" hidden in the gates spread.

The entire forum suddenly fell silent, and the trend even bent towards worshiping Zhong Xia's ID.

To the extent that some people proposed that Zhong Xia's ID surpassed the strong existence of "Dong Cheng Yin" and "Xing Kong Dai Ying".
Here is the translation of the text:

Only a small group of resistance fighters on the forum still hold out against the majority, who believe that the achievements of the saint warrior "Vivian" from the depths of hell, who is said to be working together with the opponent, are the main contributor.

"Tweet."

Suddenly, Xiaoyu's phone rang.

"Xiaoyu, Wang Qingwei is having an online Q&A session on the forum today."

At this time, someone in her class game group sent her a message.

As the winter break approached, and the high school students in the entire city were delayed in their make-up classes, many of them decided to take advantage of the time to level up in games.

"Woah."

Xiaoyu saw that it was her favorite Wang Qingwei, who she had previously asked Zhao Xu for Wang Qingwei's contact information, but Zhao Xu had ignored her. Xiaoyu couldn't help but send a heart emoji and immediately put aside the task of helping Zhao Xu with his documents and opened the forum homepage.

She found that Wang Qingwei's Q&A session had been pushed to the top of the page.

After Wang Qingwei's true identity was exposed half a month ago, her pure and kind exterior had caused a huge sensation on various social media platforms. Her companions also began to share their experiences of interacting with Wang Qingwei, and her good-natured and gentle character was quickly established. With her outstanding appearance, various fan groups suddenly emerged.

However, Wang Qingwei quietly refused the invitations from most of the talent agencies and commercial companies, and continued to fight every day in the game.

Slowly, her fan group also began to form, becoming a powerful force on the forum, and quickly catching up with other technical posts.

At this time, a question suddenly appeared on the forum:

"Qingwei, Qingwei, look at me. Do you know the person who recently appeared with the near-divine artifact, Zhongxia?"
South Xiaoyu saw this sentence, although Zhao Xu had grown taller in her heart, she still wanted to reply to the other side, thinking what to say.

However, Wang Jingwei quickly typed out a sentence.

【Hey, we know each other, he even saved me in the game, you know? (≧ω≦*)】
