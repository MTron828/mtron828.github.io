Chapter 081: Mission

"How about that?" Zhao Xu asked.

The horse-drawn carriage, which had been converted into a cargo carrier by removing the rear carriage door at Luo Ya's request, took the servants nearly an hour to restore it to its original state.

The only shortcoming was that the wheels would vibrate slightly as they moved, causing the carriage to creak and groan.

The entire open road was still quite flat, but the four of them were not thinking about the unusual treatment of this horse-drawn carriage.

They all gazed at Zhao Xu with a mixture of admiration and puzzlement, as if they were trying to find something different from his 13-point handsome appearance.

The players' progress was clear, and most of them had upgraded to level 2, with warriors and barbarians being the majority.

As for those who practiced magic, they had just graduated and were preparing to reach the peak of their career, let alone level 2 or even skill points. Arthur's character card was too clear, with each person's abilities neatly categorized.

Therefore, they couldn't understand why Zhao Xu could surpass this limit.

To outsiders, this was just a game.
But to many Arthur players, this was a way of life.

"If I say that the ghost is walking on its own," Zhao Xu thought for a moment before saying, "do you believe it?"

The few people shook their heads in unison, with the most pronounced shaking coming from the one who was most skeptical.

However, the gaze of the others turned to Zhao Xu, and they saw a hint of strangeness. They didn't expect Zhao Xu, who had just saved them, to be reluctant to take credit.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Especially for Arthur, the only way to recharge is to get an extra set of clothes for 300 yuan."

"Ah, I said it's 'dispel'?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment and continued to say.

"Brother Summer, we can't dispel such high-level undead creatures."

Yu Yu didn't think that this unassuming pastor sister would suddenly have a day like a cat playing with a dead mouse.

A ghost soul is not high-level, it can't dispel undead creatures, and it's not about the challenge level. Instead, it's about the hit points, which is HD.

However, the ghost soul has a dispel resistance, equivalent to a high-level undead creature with 4 more HD.

"This is actually one of my tasks," Zhao Xu began to reveal a thoughtful expression, as if there were many entanglements.

Even the most solemn warrior, like Maple Leaf, couldn't help but twist his body slightly to better hear the sound.

"Can you guys keep my secret?" Zhao Xu suddenly raised his voice a little.

The four-person team, like a sense of mission descending, all nodded slightly, with a look of enthusiasm and craving on their faces, looking at Zhao Xu.

Gossip is always a tool to lower human defenses.

"This involves a historical event that transcends over a thousand years," Zhao Xu began to construct.

When Yu Yu heard this sentence, he took a deep breath, as if he were in the era of great destiny a thousand years ago.

The car body, originally made of steel plates, suddenly became full of magic, repeatedly echoing Zhao Xu's voice in their ears.

Every player dreams of being told by an NPC, "You now have a task that concerns the fate of this world."
Here is the translation of the text:

"In the days before, I was still a clumsy apprentice."

Zhao Xu slightly looked up at the car roof with a slight breeze.

The poet, Nan Ji Qing Wa, suddenly felt that the summer before him was like a poet.

"That day, my teacher was about to leave me, and in the last moment, she handed me a task."

"The teachers of our school have been carrying the heavy burden of sacrifice for generations. It is both a guardian and a fetter."

"Now, they finally have the opportunity to change, and they have the chance to break free."

"As long as I can take someone to Mistral."

"This concerns the fate of our entire school and the future of the organization."

Zhao Xu deliberately used double meanings in the Arthurian language, using real dialogue to say words that were open to interpretation.

In fact, this task is for him to escort himself to Mistral.

As for the fate of the school and the organization, Zhao Xu is definitely concerned, but it only occupies a small part.

Changing and breaking free is also inevitable, as long as Zhao Xu can become a high-level mage, he can naturally replace the labor of other mages, and that's enough to free others.

"Wow." Before the wanderer could ask Zhao Xu what it was, the priest murmured in surprise, looking at Zhao Xu's eyes, which emitted a bright, sparkling light.

The lone male protagonist, who had left his hometown to complete his teacher's bequest, encountered a wild druid who was blown away by the summoning storm, and encountered a ghostly king who was a thousand miles away, with a thousand miles of desolate land and nine empty rooms.
Here is the translation of the text:

The story of a hero who bears a heavy mission but appears calm, has already taken shape in my heart.

"So, for this escort mission, I have a few one-time props. They're just ordinary everyday objects, but in certain situations, they can be quite effective. That's also where our organization's strength lies."

"So, I hope you won't reveal my secrets, so I won't be targeted by some members of our organization."

"Otherwise, I can go solo and take care of it myself, and I won't need to take risks by joining a smuggling group," Zhao Xu said, emphasizing the smuggling group.

The four of them immediately turned red.

Working for a smuggling group is not a glamorous thing.

This smuggling group is composed mostly of warriors, not regular soldiers who have received formal training, nor are they innocent. Soldiers look down on them.

Not to mention that the group also has a devoted follower of the goddess like Yu, who dares to be the bodyguard for the smuggling group.

The benevolent god and the saintly warrior can pull back every arrow that has gone astray and put it back on the right track.

"We've messed up something and owe a large sum of money," Maple Leaf whispered.

When Zhao Xu heard this, he thought it was no wonder they dared to take this route, as they were burdened by debt.

These players, they don't even look at why this smuggling group, which doesn't even bring a single passenger, has brought them a few players.

This means that the journey ahead may involve some things that are hard to say.

We can't let the locals in Fierce Wind City get involved in the leak, but we need these few players who can revive, to speak out about what they've seen after they're revived.

That is, the payment for Maple Leaf and the four of them has already included their four revive stones.
Here is the translation:

"Oh, oh, brother Zhou, why don't you listen to us and find out why we owe so much money?"

Yueyue asked Zhao Xu.

"I don't plan to pay it back for you, so what's the point of asking?" Zhao Xu said with a puzzled expression.

"... "
