Chapter 417: Legendary Puppet

As the copper box transformed, it gradually merged into a spherical shape, appearing extremely smooth and devoid of any markings.

Subsequently, the copper ball began to divide into two, with one half transforming into a small human shape, while the other half remained unchanged.

The entire process occurred at lightning speed, and suddenly, the copper ball transformed into a silver-white small person.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had his right hand resting on the edge of the transmission portal, while his left hand held the silver-white small person and another unchanged copper ball.

Suddenly, the silver-white small person emitted a powerful force, and Zhao Xu, with only 8 points of strength, instinctively released his grip. In this critical moment, Zhao Xu fervently uttered a spell â€“ "Floatation Technique!"

Although this was a second-tier spell, Zhao Xu still managed to cast it.

Instantly, the silver-white small person, which was about to fall under the influence of gravity, halted its descent and avoided the danger of being merged with the lava. It then reversed direction and began to rise towards Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu, seizing the opportunity, quickly grasped the silver-white small person. The rumbling sound that had been echoing in his ear also disappeared.

Had Zhao Xu continued to hold onto the silver-white small person, he would have triggered the curse that prohibited flight, and another lightning bolt would have struck.

Zhao Xu could only stare blankly at the object in his hand.

It seemed that only after passing through this transmission portal could the other ball transform.

"Will we maintain this stance?" Vivian asked, having already crawled up the edge of the transmission portal and grasping Zhao Xu's sleeve.
Here is the translation:

"I'm afraid it will explode if I go in, let me analyze these two things first,"

At this moment, Zhao Xu first picked up the small copper ball that looked the same as it had before, as if he was simply melting half of the copper treasure box.

As for the small man, he was extremely heavy, weighing over five or six kilograms, and felt like a dumbbell when held. He carefully examined it in front of his eyes and discovered that it was actually a statue made of secret silver.

The exterior design resembled a heavily armored iron man with a full-body armor.

Zhao Xu immediately recognized this design - it was a legendary-level secret silver statue.

Has he struck it rich?

Zhao Xu immediately used his "identification technique" by activating the mechanism on his eye patch.

Instantly, all the information about the statue was directly transmitted into his brain, causing his brain to feel numb.

"What's the matter, elder brother?" Vivi asked, noticing Zhao Xu's serious expression and distant gaze.

"I've struck it rich," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

"This is a statue of a secret silver statue that can transform into a level 21 challenge at any time if the secret silver statue is damaged. If the statue is damaged, it will cool down for a week."

At this moment, Zhao Xu spoke simply, but Vivi was stunned, lightly biting her lip as she looked at the statue that looked very plain.

It was much stronger than a secret silver statue.

Because it could automatically revive, and also solved the most cumbersome problem of the secret silver statue.

From then on, this secret silver statue was no longer limited to staying in one place, but could accompany Zhao Xu on his adventures at any time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xun had once obtained a bronze lion and eagle statue from Ran Yi's carpet, which could activate twice, with a time limit of six hours each time. This bronze lion and eagle statue could be exchanged for 10,000 gold coins.

"Head, how much is the price of the stone horse?" Vivian asked, referring to a standard price.

"10,000 gold coins," Zhou Xun replied immediately.

The stone horse was a statue carved from hard stone, proportionate to a real horse. Once an order was given, it could transform into a fine horse or even a warhorse, similar to the secret silver statue in Zhou Xun's hand.

Furthermore, the transformed horse was not only strong but also did not need to be fed or rested. Therefore, a normal warhorse was worth over 1,000 gold coins, while this magical item was worth tens of thousands of gold coins.

After using the identification technique, Zhou Xun also obtained the startup command for the secret silver statue.

However, he felt a bit surprised because this was similar to the mysterious incantation told by the May Lady on Earth.

After thinking about it, Zhou Xun suddenly stretched out and directly entered the transmission portal.

Now he had an additional secret silver statue, and his combat power was simply extraordinary.

At that moment, Zhou Xun felt as if every force was pulling him in his own direction, making him feel like he was being torn apart.

After the transmission sensation disappeared, Zhou Xun realized that he had arrived at another mysterious space.

Zhou Xun cursed in his heart, and then he directly entered the tiger's den, even without leaving.

Moreover, he was even more surprised to find that the space in front of him was also shrouded in a thick fog, making it impossible for him to see what was ahead.

Vision is the most basic guarantee, and it is often the sense of adventure that begins with the five senses.

Since he had just obtained this secret silver statue, he directly gave the startup command without even warming up his palm.
Here is the translation:

Suddenly, the statue began to slowly expand, and immediately transformed into a terrifying existence that was over four to five meters tall and weighed twelve tons. This legendary silver demon statue was far larger than the giant clockwork statues that Zhao Xu had encountered before.

"Vivi, now that this silver demon statue is taking on the main defensive role, launch a flanking attack," Zhao Xu ordered.

"Yes," Vivi replied, nodding her head, while looking at the thick fog that was blocking their line of sight. "Will we be searching for an exit together?"

"No need to search," Zhao Xu explained.

Just then, he looked at his mana pool with a worried expression.

"What's wrong?" Vivi asked.

"Nothing," Zhao Xu replied. "I just feel like I'm going to need to take a break after this wave. My mana is running low."

After saying this, Zhao Xu waved his hand and unleashed a new, untested cold door spell - Safety Guidance.

As the spell took effect, Zhao Xu's brain suddenly generated a direct route to the nearest exit.

With Safety Guidance, Zhao Xu could now pinpoint the correct route through the fog.

"Let's go," Zhao Xu said, looking at the route in his mind, estimating the distance before deciding to charge forward at full speed.

Compared to the previous stone bridge, Zhao Xu felt that everything was too easy this time.

Whether it was the strength of the monsters or the terrain design itself, everything seemed to be at a natural distance.

After about half an hour, Zhao Xu was about to reach the safety point indicated by the spell when he discovered that the silver demon statue was no longer moving.

He was taken aback and decided to proceed forward, wondering if he had reached the end of the road.
Here is the translation:

"He saw a gigantic giant standing before them, fully plated with golden light, entirely made of fine gold, and completely formed into a colossal suit of armor. Legendary Golden Golem."
