Chapter 026: The Wisdom of the Law

Looking at the incantations of the zero-level magic, Zhao Xu finally felt the legendary feeling of a martial artist who has cultivated for ten years and then emerges from his seclusion.

He was no longer a fragile ordinary person, but someone with extraordinary abilities.

Without using weapons, a simple "frost beam" could severely injure a normal civilian.

Even if it was just a game, it didn't matter, because in a year, these abilities would become the most real and genuine.

Looking at the magic descriptions, Zhao Xu was like a superpower holder.

With an object weighing less than 4 catties, he could move it with a "magician's hand".

A "touch of exhaustion" could make an opponent who had not had any exemptions fall into an exhausted state.

A "magic trick" could perform like a master magician.

Within the scope of zero-level magic, technology could still replicate similar phenomena, unlike the magic that followed, which completely surpassed human technological capabilities.

However, Zhao Xu had achieved everything without relying on external objects.

In other words, he had truly mastered the art of manufacturing resources himself.

Throw into a deep mountain forest, other professions might need to search for food and water sources, but a magician could rely on magic to manufacture real food and then take action.

This is also the reason why magicians are legendary.

At this moment, Zhao Xu finally felt relieved, having mastered the law, and the biggest obstacle that had blocked countless law apprentices had been overcome. The remaining first-level magic was also easily manageable.
He copied the spells, but where are his spell slots?

When a 1st-level wizard rests for 8 hours, he can cast 3 0-level spells and 1 1st-level spell per day. Additionally, due to his Intelligence modifier, he has an extra 1st-level spell slot. As for the 2nd and 3rd level spell slots, he has to wait until he reaches the corresponding level to cast them.

It's like he has finally mastered shooting, but then realizes he has no bullets.

"Teacher, where are my spell slots?" Zhao Xu didn't want to make any mistakes and quickly asked.

"What spell slots?" asked Antinoya.

Zhao Xu was suddenly at a loss. It made sense â€“ after learning 0-level spells, the joy he felt had made him forget.

"Don't worry, after you meet all the necessary conditions for a 1st-level wizard, you can undergo a 'triggering ritual' to obtain spell slots," Antinoya assured him.

Zhao Xu listened and nodded awkwardly.

Fortunately, even though he didn't have a real Intelligence score of 16, the system would still assign him spell slots based on 16.

But as Zhao Xu calmed down, his mind became sharper and he suddenly noticed something was off.

In recent days, countless wizard apprentices on the forum had been stuck at copying 0-level spells. Some players successfully copied one, but then struggled with the second one for a long time because they didn't even know how they succeeded in the first place.

One lucky instance didn't mean anything. Only after successfully copying 0-level spells nineteen times in a row could it be proven that the person truly mastered the spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is also Zhaoxu breaking the gaming record, completing all zero-level spells after finishing his inner heart, which is unable to suppress his pride. He is far superior to too many mages.

However, a question arises.

For thousands of years, countless mages have devoted themselves to researching spells, but no one has thought of taking this step?

Anzhenya's seemingly simple two sentences are actually supported by professional nine-dan skills.

But this step is just one step, not a continuous game.

For thousands of years, there will always be cats and mice getting together in the same situation, and someone will take this same step.

They may not have thought of this reason, but they will eventually do it.

How can it be that no one has directly popularized this method?

Looking at Zhaoxu's ambiguous face, Anzhenya walked over lightly and said, "You're weird, why can't others do the same?"
Zhaoxu was taken aback, not expecting his thoughts to be guessed.

However, the opponent's intelligence value of over 50 is too high, and he can't help but suspect.

"So, teaching players is indeed very troublesome. Through offline comparisons, many inconsistencies can be known. Sometimes, it's hard to gloss over it."

"Alright, let me explain it. This behavior of copying spells according to the trend is the privilege of 'Wise Heart Caster', the characteristic of the owner of this ability."
Zhaoxu heard these words and suddenly flashed four or five guesses in his mind.

It's not that he was terrific, but his 'Wise Heart Caster' was terrific.
Anzhenya saw that Zhaoxu had entered a state, and continued to say...
Here is the translation:

Actually, new mages who have done some research for a few years are very familiar with zero-level magic. So, they will get stuck on the utility-oriented quick-learning path. 

"Mages who use the 'Wisdom' method can record spells without truly mastering them. Many mages only realize this when they encounter spells they can't understand in the later stages."

Zhao Xu was puzzled and asked, "Teacher, do you mean that recording spells from a spellbook won't work?"

"Recording spells from a spellbook can lead to discontinuity because of the lack of continuity. If the trend is broken, how can you continue recording? However, mages who use the 'Wisdom' method record spells in a closed, self-contained mind, so they won't have a problem with discontinuity."

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that others would record one spell, then stop and start recording another, which would break the trend.

Therefore, one must thoroughly understand the spell before recording it continuously without interruption.

However, in his case, he was disassembling a component, recording it, and then disassembling another component, relying on the "Wisdom" method to continue recording, which was naturally impossible to achieve.

"What's the point of not promoting this ability?" Zhao Xu asked.

This method is extremely powerful and can produce a large number of mages directly.

As long as one has sufficient intelligence, they can produce countless mages instantly.

Even if he promoted this method to players, the Earth's power would be unstoppable.

"Ah, but anyone who uses this method is a mage's grave-digger," Anzhenya said.

Zhao Xu's face turned pale, and he said, "Not that exaggerated?"

"There is no mastery of magic without recording, and naturally, there is no motivation for meticulous research. Magic research will naturally come to a halt. Even if one can cast a 9th-level spell, it is impossible to break through the legendary barrier."
"Eventually, spells that are no longer understood will disappear."
So that's how it is.
Zhao Xu's heart was deeply shaken.
This is a direct act of copying answers, the questions are done, but there is no understanding at all.
If all students rely on copying answers to get ahead, naturally the scientific research of a country will be abandoned.
Moreover, students copying answers is a form of homework, they are mages copying answers, which is basically a source of wealth.
To put it more realistically, this is a cheating opportunity for the college entrance examination without risk.
So this kind of cheating device can only be known to a few people, and cannot be widely promoted.
Even if there are mages who like to do research, they will also be squeezed out of resources by the lack of powerful cheaters, leading to the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt that his character card as a "wise spellcaster" was a bit of a hot potato.
