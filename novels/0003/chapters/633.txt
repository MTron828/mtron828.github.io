Chapter 634: Let the World Feel Pain
"Who am I?"
Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself again.

He suddenly realized that his memories in his mind had lost a crucial link, and his entire consciousness had been filtered with an additional layer, eliminating all chains of information related to himself.

He got off the car, shut the door, and completed the actions like a flowing river.

He silently returned to the first floor and walked out again.

When he reached the gate of the residential area, the security guard who was sorting packages greeted him as usual.

Zhao Xu waved back and walked away silently.

"Hello, three yuan," the cashier at the convenience store next to the residential area read out the amount on the cash register.

Zhao Xu was holding an ice-cold can of cola in his hand, reaching into his pocket to take out his phone to scan the code.

But Zhao Xu's actions suddenly stopped when he was about to open the payment interface.

He slightly raised his eyebrows, looking at the cashier's still formulaic smile, then turned his head to look back.

On the counter of the convenience store, two girls dressed as students were sitting and eating curry fish cake, discussing last night's variety show with enthusiasm.

Zhao Xu held the can and then quickly released it.

It was not unusual to see students wearing school uniforms on weekends, as schools across the city had standardized uniforms. Many students would wear school uniforms on weekends, making this scene a common sight in the busiest pedestrian street.

It was already around 10:30 am, and it was not a suitable time for a makeup lesson.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not the right time to eat breakfast, even if you're just strolling around.

This scene looks like something I pieced together from my memories.

"Sir, that'll be 3 yuan," the cashier said, looking at the young man in front of him. The cashier couldn't help but whisper a gentle reminder.

"Sorry," the young man, Zhao Xu, said, turning around to face the cashier.

"I've already paid," he said, somewhat awkwardly, before taking out a straw and walking out of the convenience store.

The cashier, who was still waiting for him to pay, looked puzzled and shook his head, saying, "Oh, you just paid?"

He glanced at the cash register screen, which showed no record of the transaction, and he hadn't even picked up the scanner gun. But deep down, he was convinced that he had paid.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu walked back onto the sidewalk, with the morning sun shining down on his face, that he felt a sense of comfort and tranquility.

Just a few steps away was a grove of trees that spanned the entire street, with lush greenery above and neatly manicured flowers below. It was as if the city had put in a lot of effort into its landscaping.

But Zhao Xu's thoughts were elsewhere.

He thought to himself, "I don't even remember who I am, but why did I just use that 'trick' so naturally, as if I'd done it every day?"

Could it be that he was a master psychologist who specialized in hypnosis before?

He looked down at his own palm, which was smooth and white, revealing that his hands were not roughened by labor and had no calluses.

Is this some kind of magic?

Arthur?

What is this again?
Here is the translation of the text:

Why do these memories seem so unfamiliar?

Zhao Xu wandered aimlessly around his neighborhood, lost in thought. It was as if he was searching for a key to unlock his memories, but it was like a middle-aged father who had lost his job and couldn't face his family, stuck at the entrance of his home, unable to move forward. He counted the cracks on the sidewalk, one by one.

The cars whizzing by, one by one, in the city street. Even the street scenes, the elderly resting, children playing, and the peaceful courtyard scenes were etched in Zhao Xu's mind, allowing him to perfectly replicate everything he saw. But still, there was no change.

As Zhao Xu walked across the road without a designated crossing, a sudden, sharp buzzing sound came from a passing car. The driver frantically pressed the horn.

He had just looked down at his phone's WeChat notification and couldn't have imagined that someone would suddenly appear in front of the road, especially on this secluded path that rarely had anyone walking on it. The distance was getting too close!

The driver's mind went blank, and he suddenly slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. His foot wasn't on the brake pedal, but on the accelerator instead. Zhao Xu, meanwhile, suddenly snapped out of his trance, turned his head, and looked at the car body, which was mere feet away, with a bright red paint job.

It was as if the next moment, his blood would splatter all over the top and merge into one. But Zhao Xu didn't know why; his heart rate hadn't even skipped a beat. Instead, his mind quietly reflected on different messages.
Here is the translation:

Choose One: Jump and dodge, relying on 33-layer reflective evasion to avoid a collision with a probability of over 80%.

Choose Two: Burst out quickly and safely walk to the side.

Choose Three: Instantly teleport to the other side of the road; you can also use dimensional jump, teleportation, or other spatial movement spells.

Choose Four: Release a force field wall, forcibly creating an indestructible wall; the cost is that the accelerating car will crash into the wall; you can also use explosive balls, Bieg series spells, or similar methods.

Choose Five: Use the giant transformation spell, increasing your strength to 50 points and your weight by eightfold, and confront the accelerating car with your bare hands; however, this may cause severe deformation of the car.

...And so on, a total of over ten options emerged, as if Zhao Xu's mind had only lightly stirred an idea, and these ideas burst forth without end, one by one.

However, just as the bumper was about to hit Zhao Xu's waist, he still silently activated his "action"!
One move, no move.
But in the driver's eyes, it was as if a ghost had appeared, and the original target that was about to collide suddenly disappeared without a trace, with no sense of impact.

The car body continued to accelerate forward without obstruction, except that the driver's back felt cold, as if he had seen a ghost during the day.
He was even too scared to look back, and he drove away, reciting Buddhist scriptures and pressing the accelerator.

Teleportation is a powerful defensive spell that allows the caster to switch between the material plane and the spiritual plane repeatedly.
This makes the enemy's attack only 50% likely to hit.
Here is the translation:

However, the cost is that the attacker's own attack has a 20% chance of being lost due to the inability to grasp the switching, and it is possible that the attack will be launched during the spiritual realm, making it impossible to realize the attack in the material realm.

The virtual creatures are also difficult to handle, as they are already in the spiritual realm.

As for those who can attack and penetrate both realms, they are not ordinary beings.

The "Higher Flash" technique of the Four Rings is able to control the switching time between the spiritual and material realms, making it impossible to lose either the technique or the attack.

Zhao Xu prepared himself and directly entered the spiritual realm, allowing the car to pass through the space where he was no longer present, leaving no trace behind.

After the car tire had rotated dozens of times, Zhao Xu's figure reappeared, walking slowly and calmly to the opposite side of the road.

As Zhao Xu looked at the "Teleportation Technique" in his mind, he suddenly remembered that he should go and take a look at this world.

Perhaps by finding a weakness in this world, his consciousness could return.

Over the next short day, he used this technique to traverse hundreds of locations around the globe.

Just half a minute ago, he was standing at the tip of the Eiffel Tower, gazing at the War God Square on the south bank of the Seine River in Paris.

However, as soon as he heard the cries of people below, Zhao Xu disappeared as a light point, leaving behind a group of believers who had encountered an angel.

The next moment, Zhao Xu appeared at the North Pole, where he looked around and saw that everything was to the south, as the North Pole was in the middle of the polar night, with no sunlight for 24 hours.

Zhao Xu then continued to jump between landmarks such as Big Ben, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Red Square, the Taj Mahal, and the Parthenon, walking through each one in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even after that, he directly adopted the art of concealment, sparing the nearby tourists from seeing him emit a surprised cry from the top of the building.

Standing at that highest position, Zhao Xu also genuinely felt the sense of being a ghost from the Assassin's Creed, standing at the highest point, gazing down at the entire city's desolate atmosphere.

Finally, after a long time, Zhao Xu returned to a high tower.

After a whole day of wandering, the "self" he was looking for continued to recede, as if two parallel lines that could never intersect.

At that moment, he blew gently on the evening wind, looking at his sleeves rolled up, and couldn't help but sigh: "What a real and magnificent world!"

"I'm so convinced that there's no reason to doubt that this is a false world."

At that moment, his self-mumbling voice was blown away by the high-altitude evening wind.

"If this world is false, then death can terminate all that is before us."

The voice continued to persuade him, as if it was his own subconsciousness.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, and the entire city's nighttime scene of red lights and green traffic lights was right before his eyes. He even saw that the entire road below was blocked by cars, unable to pass through.

"Solving the problem is not just about death," he said.

As he spoke, he stretched out his finger and made a shooting gesture towards the empty space in front of him.

"Peng!"

Immediately after, he simulated the sound of a gunshot with his mouth.

However, he gazed at the cumulus clouds in the night sky, which looked like a layered, detailed painting.

"These cars and clouds remind me that if this world is false, it's like a highly advanced calculator."
Here is the translation:

"So it can't compare to the true nature of the world."

"Just like the 21st century is still plagued by the problem of turbulence, and the numerical solution of the NS equation is always elusive. Therefore, the numerical solution of turbulence can only rely on computers."

"However, nature is always processing the most precise 'solution' in every second, repeating it countless times, in places where turbulence occurs, such as clouds in the sky, waves in the sea, and air currents in between."

As Zhao Xu spoke, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

"I don't know why you, in the afterlife, advised me to die."

"But I beg you, don't underestimate the destructive power of a mage like me."

"The ability to shut down the world."

With that, Zhao Xu raised his hand and performed the most basic incantation gesture for the "Urban Locating Spell".

This is a very ordinary spell that allows him to sense the location and distance of the nearest urban city, used to measure the actual distance to the target city.

Therefore, it has a notable feature - due to the search reason, the spell's effective range is extremely wide - 16 kilometers per level, which is a total radius of 500 kilometers.

Almost 80 million square kilometers, equivalent to 1/12 of China, more than 3 times the size of the UK, more than 2 times the size of Japan, and more than 2 times the size of Germany, and more than 1 times the size of France.

And the next moment, Zhao Xu began his slaughter in this dream.

He wanted to turn this "Urban Locating Spell" into a "Killing Spell"!

The "Frosty Aura Spell" specialized in darkness, could cause an additional 2 points of frost damage to all targets within the spell's range.
Here is the translation:

The question is, it can only affect spells with a "cold" description. Another specialty, "Snowcasting", can join snow or ice as a component in the casting of a spell to make it obtain a "cold" descriptor. When combined, it becomes Zhao Xu's "Urban Orientation Technique", which, when combined with "Snowcasting" and "Frosty Spell", can affect all living beings within a radius of 80 million square kilometers, including those within 500 kilometers above and below the ground.

This is a spherical area, and all living beings within it will be affected by a damage of 66 points. As for an old tiger's life force, it would be reduced to an average of 45 life points.

So, 66 points are enough to wipe out the life force of most living beings on the spot, directly killing them.

Even Zhao Xu doesn't need to consider "Spell Burst", "Thunderbolt", "Energy Mixing", and "Spell Damage" to further modify the damage.

66 points are enough.

Next, Zhao Xu continues his ritual.

What's urgent is that he only needs to simulate two specialties at the same time, as the heroic spirit can only provide 1 point of latent talent per round.

Therefore, Zhao Xu activates the 9th-level specialty - Dragon Oracle!

One, perform the ritual "Divination Praise" to add a bonus to Wisdom (Perception) and Insight.

Two, simulate the specialty "Divine Hero" - effect: when in a state of divination praise, an additional 1 point of latent talent is gained.

In an instant, Zhao Xu gains 2 temporary latent points and directly casts the spell...

Three, "Frosty Ray" spell.

Immediately, a small piece of ice appears in his hand, and a refreshing feeling also comes from his palm.

And in the next second, Zhao Xu hesitates not at all, combining his hands into a fist...
Here is the translation:

"Mysterious Prophecy: Urban Spatial Technique.
Potential Point Simulation: Snow's Blessing.
Potential Point Simulation: Frost's Curse.
Zhao Xu spoke in an icy tone - 'Let this world feel pain!'"
