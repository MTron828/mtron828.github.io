Chapter 526: Challenge from Players

"Sorry, it seems like we'll have to delay our conversation for a bit," Zhao Xu said with an apologetic tone.

Reputation is a powerful tool that can attract a hundred followers with just one call.
Even if someone online dares to slander the name "Zhong Xia" (仲夏), many people who have never met Zhao Xu will spontaneously become his die-hard fans and engage in heated debates with the haters.
Some people will even deliberately create a fan circle and use filtering methods to ensure that only the most loyal and devout fans remain.
Zhao Xu himself has also privately complained about the similarities between this phenomenon and the way gods absorb followers.
During the initial crossover period, these fans who gathered around the protagonist's aura received special treatment from the earthlings around them.
Those who quickly rose to the ranks and became professional fans or even secured the support of the gods fared relatively well and enjoyed a comfortable life.
However, those who lacked the ability to match their reputation will become stumbling blocks for the gods to harvest faith. Even those who lacked a stage to perform will see their basic fan base constantly dwindling until they are eventually killed off by the "red-eyed" arrow.

As for now, Zhao Xu has also received a different kind of "red-eyed" treatment.
The group just arrived at the Deep Blue Song, which is not a secret, and many players followed to watch the spectacle. However, no one wants to pay the minimum consumption fee for the Deep Blue Song, so few players have been able to sneak in as reporters.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the fountain square in front of the deep blue song is, where a player dressed in a thick leather armor, with a gloomy face, is standing, playing with a sharp sword in one hand and shouting at the top-story Zhao Xiu.

Seeing Zhao Xiu's determination to fight, Cui Lu also expressed concern: "Mr. Zhong Xia, if you agree to this battle, even if you use your life, it won't make a difference. From today on, you'll be overwhelmed by battles every day for several months."

It's impossible to level up to the top player.

However, the situation is different when it comes to fighting. It's not about who has a higher level; it's about who is stronger. If it were based on level, everyone would just go back home.

"Let's do this, Mr. Zhong Xia," Cui Lu suggested. "They want to challenge you, but they'll have to go through our corpses first."

At this moment, Zhang Qi, who was grateful to Zhao Xiu for saving his life, was filled with indignation and said, "Why don't those cats and dogs come and join the fun?"

"Moreover, they may take advantage of your insufficient spell slots to target you using a carrousel battle strategy, consuming your spell slots. Once you accept the challenge, you'll be stuck in the opponent's trap, and it's better to cut off ties now."

Cui Lu thought for a moment and warned, "Or we can ask them to provide a penalty, so we can filter out most of the players who rely on luck."

As she said this, she couldn't help but glance at Zhao Xiu, saying, "So, I don't recommend this battle for today."

At this moment, Cui Lu's gaze had already fallen on the player standing below, dressed in a thick leather armor, with a gloomy face, and thought to himself, "This guy looks like someone who can't even afford a hundred gold coins."

Zhao Xu also nodded, saying, "You're all right in what you say."

"However, I will give them a lifelong unforgettable experience today. The next player who wants to find their sense of existence by relying on me will probably think about it for a while, thank you for your kindness, and please don't worry."

After finishing speaking, Zhao Xu walked away quickly.

He also realized that the challenge posed by the wanderer had caused these classmates who had only had a superficial relationship with him to unconsciously gather behind him, creating a situation where ordinary people become fans of the wanderer due to Blackie's influence.

Not long after, Zhao Xu arrived at the fountain square, and with the wanderer's loud shout, the players who had been unclear about the situation were also drawn over.

"Mr. Zhongxia, I know you're currently recognized as the first player," the wanderer said, licking his face.

"But I won't surrender." He said, "So I'm here to challenge you, to prove who is the first player in the game."

As he spoke, he looked at the players slowly gathering around, their numbers gradually increasing, and said with even greater confidence: "If I win, I won't need you to acknowledge yourself. All I need is for you to publicly reveal the method of rapid leveling up."

As soon as the opponent said this, the players in the scene began to clamor, and a few good-natured ones also started clapping and cheering in support.

Zhao Xu, however, raised an eyebrow.

He didn't expect that this unassuming wanderer player would also be a master of stirring up the atmosphere.

However, this brother did not know one thing.

Arthur also has such a propensity for grandstanding.

However, most of them are powerful, otherwise they would have long since been beaten to death by social pressure.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu waved his hand lightly, "I'll just ask one question, is it a bet with life and death?"

As he spoke, he raised an eyebrow, looking at the opponent, "If you can step over my corpse, what conditions will you propose?"

"Good!" "Big deal!" "Not worthy of being the first!"

The players around him were also restless and bored, and they started blowing whistles to create a louder noise and attract more attention.

Zhang Qi and others were also watching Zhao Xu with tense expressions.

Just this brief contact had already won them over to this player, the first person "Zhong Xia", and they naturally didn't want him to suffer a defeat.

Zhang Qi and others were convinced that the first person Zhong Xia could easily defeat the wandering player.

However, what happened next was that many players who were eager to take risks had already gathered.

A "Revival Stone" could be exchanged for the opportunity to challenge the first person, and this was very attractive to these wolves.

The reason why the Jianghu was so cruel was that every year, new players would emerge, and they would sacrifice the blood and reputation of the old masters to prove themselves. This was a way for new players to bury the old ones.

The wandering player, seeing Zhao Xu agreeing so easily and not even mentioning any additional conditions, was taken aback and felt that his prepared responses were all in vain.

Instead, he became cautious, fearing that this rare opportunity would be wasted due to a small mistake.

Zhao Xu smiled carelessly, saying, "It's up to you, you can all come, but to me, none of you are different."
Here is the translation of the text:

When he said that, a few ambitious players in the game started cheering and were about to jump up to participate. However, they all believed that Zhao Xu would definitely be able to smoothly defeat the first challenger and seize the opportunity. They thought that as long as they defeated "Zhong Xia", who would care about the conspiracy behind it or whether the opponent had already exhausted their magical abilities?

"That's what you said, Mr. Zhong Xia," said this wanderer, his face reddening and his expression becoming more excited. "Am I going to go?"

As he said that, his sinister intentions were fully revealed.

Arthur's various mysterious abilities were countless, and he didn't believe that Mr. Zhong Xia could understand all the changes in various professions. He had trained for a long time and used his powerful skills on the first person, which was not at all disappointing.

Thinking about this, the 4th-level wanderer couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"So I have to...", but suddenly, the wanderer shouted, "Then let's start!"

As he shouted, he had already entered a state of sprinting and tried to take the initiative.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu shook his head silently.

He quietly took out a bone wand made from a finger bone from his sleeve and held it gently in his palm, feeling the rhythm of death on the surface.

"Binding Soul Technique!"
