Chapter 11: The Magician's Entrance

Zhao Xu's dormitory in this game is much larger than a typical college dormitory in the real world. After the mass migration to the Earth, the first major problem that the global community faced was the housing crisis. Many people who had just finally acquired their own homes on Earth were forced to start over again in this new world. Many people initially had to rely on temporary accommodations and vagrancy.

Zhao Xu, however, was able to directly fulfill his housing needs. In the middle of the dormitory was a sturdy wooden table, half a person high, with a simple alchemy tool set placed on it. The bed on the left side was a rectangular bed with a neatly folded quilt. On the other side was a bookshelf that wrapped around three walls.

Zhao Xu glanced at the books, which included "Easy Spellcasting for Beginners", "The Path of the Magician: First Heart", "Exploring the Origins of the Eight Major Magical Systems", and "Transformation Magic: Shape Shifting". All the books were about magic, and Zhao Xu knew that if he opened any of them, he would find the content to be detailed and reliable.

Many people were initially amazed by the incredible details, but as more magical books began to spread, some people started to doubt whether today's AI could have created such a knowledge system. Although the magical theories in these books seemed absurd, they were surprisingly coherent.

It was not just a haphazard collection of medieval magic books copied and pasted together. However, just these books alone could not shock Zhao Xu to the point where his jaw almost dropped.
Here is the translation:

A woman in a black robe and cape stood in front of the desk, gazing at him as if contemplating the passage of time. Zhao Xu thought to himself, "Arthur's wizards can't possibly be so cheap as to offer one-on-one guidance to these novice players."

"Good day, Mr. Zhongshu," the woman said, not lowering her gaze from him. Her face remained shrouded in mystery, exuding an aura of mystique. Her voice was clear and melodious.

"Let me introduce myself. I am Anzhi Noya, your instructor for the wizarding training program. I will help you complete your wizarding training over the next period of time."

"Has Misterla's wizard already reached this level of prosperity?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

He was aware that, even at the peak of the wizarding world, the traditional one-on-one apprenticeship model was rare. Only legendary wizards who stood at the pinnacle of the world were taught individually. Otherwise, the teaching quality was inferior to the professional group teaching of the current mainstream.

One-on-one apprenticeship was mostly seen in rural areas where wandering wizards took apprentices.

So, his initial reaction was not excitement but rather a few doubts. If it was just a game, he didn't care. But since he had to learn seriously, even if everyone else leveled up to level 2, he didn't mind.

"This period of time in the academy is the only time in his life where he can acquire knowledge without cost. "You don't need to worry, I'll only assist and answer your initial questions. You can refer to the recent lecture list on the desktop and participate in the lectures according to your needs."

After saying that, she casually handed it over, never turning her head throughout, as if she had a profound understanding of every document on the table.

Zhou Xu took it over without examining it closely, stuffing it into his backpack, but his gaze kept drifting back to the cloak on the other person.

The cloak emitted a bright glow, like a cluster of stars, which stirred a suspicion in his heart.

The mysterious girl, Anniya, looked at Zhou Xu's interest in her cloak, and said, "If you're interested in this cloak, after completing your training, I can give you a set just like it."

"Really?" Zhou Xu couldn't help but raise his voice, hearing that outstanding graduates would receive a grand gift.

"It's definitely true," Anniya said. "This cloak is not worth much, it's just a decorative item."

Zhou Xu almost choked on his words, almost imagining the scene.

An item rumored to be unobtainable, had just entered his mind.

The Star Cloak, rumored to be able to repel non-magical attacks, could also reduce magical attack damage by half, as long as it passed a certain test. It was priced at 130,000 gold coins, but it was never sold, and even if someone tried to bid, there was no place to buy it.

However, when it came to graduation gifts, the most luxurious one on the forum was a 50-gold-coin giant sword.

Others usually got a weapon worth no more than 10 gold coins.

From then on, Zhou Xu sat comfortably at his desk, reading the introductory book provided by Anniya: "The Path of Arcana".

The book cover featured a strange pattern, like a mysterious giant web, connecting countless nodes.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, judging by the appearance, it already looks like it's from a bygone era, giving off a sense of nostalgia. According to the traditional concept that the older something is, the stronger it is, it's worth a lot of money. But the author's intention to break this value by writing under the name of AnTiNoYa destroyed it. It made Zhao Xu involuntarily sigh at the heartlessness of people. The developer must have had a bad intention when they created this ancient magic technique.

As he flipped through the content, he asked AnTiNoYa about the content inside. This is the reason why many players choose to play as a wizard. People don't come to play games to learn. Therefore, before many people know the strength of wizards, they are often deterred by the incredible training and directly switch to other professions. Moreover, the wizard's first level is a complete newbie.

The life dice is the fewest among all professions, with only D4. Even the priest has D8. This is a hellish difficulty route in a limited revival stone situation. Therefore, few people can be bothered to delve into the game's recorded knowledge of magic techniques, except for those interested in mysticism or middle-school students.

Players truly understand the strength of wizards only after they reach level 5, then 7, and finally 9. This gradual change in perception also gradually elevates the wizard profession to a divine level. Players are not unaware of the NPC wizards they have encountered in other online games, but the NPC and player systems are fundamentally different. Therefore, when they see powerful NPC wizards, they don't think much of it.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unbeknownst to these NPCs, they are leveling up just like players, accumulating slowly over time. Zhao Xun knows this but is still puzzled by the tutorials that look like ancient texts. In theory, academic teaching methods should involve lecturing a group of players and gradually guiding them. His self-study approach, however, is quite unique.

The only thing that brings him some comfort is that the book "The Path of Arcana" is well-written, especially since it has a sense of depth and timelessness. After asking questions one by one, the female mage answers him in detail. However, he still feels a bit awkward, like driving on a road with no clear direction in the desert.

As he flips through the pages, Zhao Xun asks, "Why didn't you teach me magic tricks first?" Magic tricks refer to the basic magic spells that every mage should master. It's only later that mages learn more advanced spells.

In reality, the other person has been explaining the origin of magic from the beginning, leaving Zhao Xun confused. Mages' courses are difficult, but they should at least explain the basics of magic, such as how to prepare and cast spells.

The player listening is getting impatient, but at least the target is clear. Anzy, on the other hand, is very elegant and says, "What's there to talk about preparing magic spells? It's just like water flowing into a canal, isn't it?"

Zhao Xun is astonished, "How does water flow into a canal?" According to the server records, the first player to complete the mage training has already done so in a week.

This is not the average case.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's obvious that the overall progress of players is unknown, and even Zhao Xu, who joined 8 months later, still has some players who haven't completed the wizard training course.

For each profession, in order to be recognized as a 1st-level character by the system, it's necessary to be able to master all profession skills.

For example, as a wizard, one needs to be able to record all 0th-level spells and 3 1st-level spells, and successfully cast 1st-level spells, learn to transcribe spellbooks, successfully summon pets, and learn dragon language.

Now, some people are saying that this is a walk in the park? These big shots should understand that these novice players don't have the real intelligence and can't truly understand these knowledge in such a short time. It's only when everyone gets their corresponding body and attributes after a year that it will be a walk in the park."
