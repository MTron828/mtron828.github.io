Chapter 048: Power

The Blue Star Power in the early days of crossing over Arthur spent a long time consolidating its strength. In reality, the Blue Star Power had taken shape as soon as it crossed over, but it wasn't until it could truly express its own voice that it took a few years to do so.

The old powers that had arrived in the new world naturally refused to give up their power and continued to try to prolong their influence. However, they faced Arthur, who possessed extraordinary abilities in this magnificent world, and were completely powerless to resist.

Many players who had played Arthur saw the old powers holding on to their power, and many directly walked away, as they already had their own power in Arthur. The Blue Star Power itself was unstable until high-level players took the lead and suppressed various divisions before it finally stopped.

This process was actually what many people had expected.

High-level players didn't need to mention their individual quality; even without it, they had obtained strong attributes in the game after crossing over, including strategic thinking, observation, and leadership ability, all of which far exceeded the normal level of humans.

Just relying on attribute values, they had already become superhumans in the Blue Star Power.

Zhao Xu maintained human attributes to some extent in order to lead the Blue Star Power in the future.

As long as he was at the top level among players on Earth, the highest council would definitely have a seat for him.

Regardless of elves, dwarves, or half-human, all these races had their own racial gods. Only humans were born without a god of humanity.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, Xiao Ge, as for the Alliance, I think it's unlikely that we'll see any significant changes within the next few months. Everyone is still too low-level to compete with the Arthur's influence," Zhang Qi said.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, implying that it's unrealistic for players to gain dominance within the next year.

The first city dominated by the Blue Star Alliance will only be built after everyone has crossed over. Arthur is not designed to serve players, so there's no need to cater to their preferences.

Zhao Xu then chatted with a few people before heading out for a run.

He usually spent most of his time playing Arthur, often lying in bed or on a couch, which could lead to muscle atrophy if continued.

Although he's disabled, he still prioritizes his physical health, as he wants to maintain his energy for the future.

Zhao Xu lives in the dormitory building in the northern zone, with a ring of trees surrounding it. He decided to run in the alleyway beneath the dormitory building instead of going to the gym.

As he ran past the convenience store, he coincidentally met a few classmates who were coming out of the store. Among them was the most beautiful girl in their class, who was considered a goddess.

After returning from his previous life, Zhao Xu had only glanced at his classmates briefly before the class started. For the past half-month, he had been busy fighting in Arthur every day.

Today was the first time he had seen the girl he had a crush on in college, but he just gave her a quick glance before running off.

In his previous life, he had never pursued her, and it's even less likely this time around.
Here is the translation:

The current goddesses don't know that the gamers they look down upon will rise to become the leaders in the future.

Zhou Xu remembers that Cui Lu was well-liked by her classmates for her courage to love and hate, as well as her excellent gaming skills. She was popular throughout the entire grade.

According to normal circumstances, she should have become a nostalgic object for her classmates to reminisce about during their reunion in the future.

However, after reincarnation, Cui Lu also lived a brilliant life.

In her past life, her archery skills were renowned far and wide, and she eventually integrated the entire alliance under her leadership.

Li Tian Ge, the class genius, also reincarnated and realized that he was among the elite. He pursued her intensely, trying to form an alliance with her, but ultimately failed.

Cui Lu, on the other hand, took care of her classmates, including Zhou Xu, who received her help.

Later, Cui Lu even rose to a high position in the Blue Star Force and remained unmarried.

It can be said that Cui Lu, regardless of her past or present, was never part of the group that she aspired to be with.

In the present, Zhou Xu is interested in the alliance that spans multiple universities in the city, but he has no interest in her personally. He doesn't covet anyone's body.

"See, Luo Luo, look at Zhou Xu just ran over," said a girl with glasses, waving her hand to Cui Lu.

"Ah, I saw it! What's going on?" Cui Lu replied, not quite grasping the situation.

"This guy is definitely a high-level player, everyone's guessing," said the girl with glasses. "My classmate said he's been fighting every day in the arena. You recently proposed to use the class union as a basis to form a union across the entire department, don't you think someone like him who can fight day and night is a high-level player?"
Here is the translation:

"Hmm, don't bother with him. He's been skipping classes and it's getting ridiculous. I've had to cover for him several times already." The class monitor, Fang Xiuyue, interrupted, and she was one of the golden flowers in Zhao Xiu's class.

Liu Rou nodded in agreement with the monitor, but her gaze kept drifting back to Zhao Xiu, who had already left, revealing her strange emotions.

...

After finishing his run, Zhao Xiu went to a fast food restaurant to eat and then returned to his dorm to brush his teeth and go to bed at 12 midnight.

The next day, when he logged in to play games, his spirit was revitalized again.

Early in the morning, he meditated in his dorm room for less than half an hour to prepare his mage spells.

In the following days, as long as he didn't use up all the spells, he wouldn't need to prepare them again. However, if he had new ideas, he could still modify the prepared spells.

After doing this, he browsed through those headache-inducing religious texts.

It wasn't until he heard the morning bell that he left his assigned priest's quarters.

Outside, many novice priests like him were heading to morning prayer.

Zhao Xiu had already memorized the layout of the surroundings the day before, so he knew where to go.

He changed into his priestly robes, took a book with him, and looked quite dignified.

The novice priests around him curiously eyed Zhao Xiu, but seeing his novice badge on his chest and his attire, they didn't suspect anything.

These novice priests came and went every day, and no one knew each other's names.

Only the person in charge of managing them knew the entire roster.

Zhao Xiu went to the morning prayer hall and found a seat to pray.
Here is the translation of the text:

The assistant standing beside took a glance at him to confirm his identity and then lost interest, waiting for the people to arrive before leaving for his own morning prayer hall.

The morning prayer hall is spacious, with 300 seats fully occupied. At the front is a four- to five-meter-high statue of a goddess.

In the Saint Heart Church, there are morning prayer halls in each district, and the one where Zhao Xu is located is exclusively for novice priests.

At this moment, there are no special arrangements, and the priests will all be praying to the goddess to obtain their divine power.

Here, the novice priests, including Zhao Xu, are all one-year trainees.

It is only after novice priests obtain divine power and become assistant priests that they will be assigned to pray together with the formal priests.

This makes the entire morning prayer hall filled with pure prayers. Only Zhao Xu is genuinely preparing for his divine power.
