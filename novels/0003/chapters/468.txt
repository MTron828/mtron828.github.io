Chapter 469: Night Appointment

"Oh, our noble has returned," someone said.

At this moment, a cold, hoarse voice echoed from outside the carriage, sounding like a stone scraping against a hard board.

Zhao Xu lightly pushed open the carriage door and suddenly saw a gaunt figure standing in front of their carriage procession.

Zhao Xu, who had witnessed this scene, couldn't help but smile coldly, recognizing a familiar face.

As he entered the Starfall Town earlier, the player's mobility was not obvious, but after entering the ancient city of Orlu, the pace slowed down, and some changes might not happen too quickly. The current situation and the future when he came to Orlu in a few years were not significantly different.

The person in front of him was Duke Carlo's loyal retainer.

Duke Carlo, the shadowy leader behind Orlu City, was a powerful figure who had been born into a noble family over a decade ago. He had the ability to lead the alliance and was a formidable force.

Especially, he had many loyal followers with various professions, including mages and druids who had served under him.

It was said that Carlo's "Three Hundred Loyal Followers" were the most feared existence in the alliance.

Unexpectedly, over a decade ago, Carlo, who was expected to be the next leader, had surprisingly supported Tang De, who had become the leader of the Northern Alliance. Naturally, Tang De had then transferred half of his leadership authority to his close friend.
Here is the translation:

As Tangde's second term of office approached its tenth year, even outsiders like Zhao Xu, who had just arrived, could sense that this leader of the alliance was not on good terms with Dukarao, despite not openly quarreling. In fact, there were already subtle signs of tension between them.

Even the rural police officer like Zhao Xu, who was recommended by Fuli, could be recruited to join the city of Oulu, which was a necessity for Tangde's leader to get "fresh blood" from outside the influence of Dukarao, who had been cultivating Oulu for many years.

As for the half-human wanderer "Siye", he was one of Dukarao's most trusted wanderers. Whether it was assassination, theft, or espionage, Siye was extremely skilled. However, he had a bad habit of getting drunk after completing a task. This had led to several close calls, and it was only through Dukarao's mercy that he had been able to survive.

At this moment, Siye had intercepted the carriage of Freyrel, the new brother-in-law of Tangde's leader, and it seemed like a small spark that could ignite a conflict between the two powerful forces.

"Siye, you're drunk, and I don't blame you, but don't block the way," Freyrel said angrily.

The guards behind him looked at their employer, who had gone to great lengths to invite the key person, the "Summer Mage", and was now being confronted by someone who wanted to humiliate him. Naturally, their hearts were filled with anger.

"Freyrel, you were once a young boy who would lick my face to learn the art of poisoning. How did you become so arrogant after your sister became the leader? You even stopped recognizing your former teacher," Siye said loudly, and at the same time, he opened the steel flask in his hand and poured the carefully brewed liquor into his mouth, letting it slide down his throat with a "glug glug" sound.

Enough food to sustain a commoner for half a month was gone in one gulp.

At this moment, Freyel's face had a pale, youthful complexion, and it suddenly turned bright red, with a look of wanting to say something but hesitating. "It's just a bunch of nonsense," he said.

Vivian, who had grasped the situation outside, also let out a sarcastic remark, and with a light touch on Zhao Xu's eye, indicating that the object he had chosen to intervene did not look very good. Zhao Xu could only force a smile.

The notebook had been possessed by the evil spirit Tang De and was even possible to have been offered to Grazzit. At the time, Anzinoa had given up on it to avoid stirring up trouble, otherwise Zhao Xu may never have gotten his hands on that notebook.

But Zhao Xu was different.

The vegetables are the original sin, and they are also the greatest protective color. He repeatedly provoked Grazzit, the Abyssal Lord, without arousing too much suspicion, and even if he did, people would only think he was seeking revenge and intervening. In the unlikely event of a lucky break, Zhao Xu might even get his hands on that notebook.

So he decided to find the "Freyel" as a stepping stone to intervene in the Orlu City.

In the process of discussing the plan and materials for setting up a wizarding association in Orlu City within half a month, Zhao Xu seized the opportunity to stir up the situation in Orlu City.

Although Zhao Xu had heard before that Freyel's family had been affiliated with the powerful noble family of Ducalio in the past, he had never expected it to be so deep. It was possible that Freyel's younger sister was sent to Ducalio by recommendation.

Later, Freyel, with his wings full of pride, had a falling out with Ducalio due to his sister's reasons and ambitions. That was another story.

"Draw the sword."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Freyrel let out a loud shout, drawing his long sword and pointing it at the wandering woman in the distance.

The expert took action, and in an instant, it was clear that the opponent was under 30 years old and had achieved a level of around 6-7 in combat skills, far surpassing Freyrel's 5-level combat skills.

The wandering woman, Siye, who had just come to taunt them, smiled slightly and then, as if seeing something good, nodded and began to leave the road, sipping a small amount of wine from a flask and wobbling her body.

"Ah, you've seen the joke, Mr. Mage," Freyrel apologized to Zhao Xu, who was looking back and forth with him.

"Not bad, not bad," Zhao Xu commented, unaffected by Freyrel's slightly reddened face.

Just then, the sound of hooves echoed from behind, indicating that the group was dissatisfied with their obstruction and refusal to move.

"Oh, it's Freyrel again," a soft, gentle voice came from behind.

As everyone, including Freyrel's subordinates, bowed to the beautiful, fox-like young woman walking towards them, Zhao Xu's eyes met hers.

This time, the title "Miss" was used, which Zhao Xu had heard or called before.

The opponent, Freyrel, was the private daughter of the Alliance leader, Tang De, who had helped Zhao Xu before.

At this moment, the level of the wandering woman, Freyrel, was unclear, but she showed no fear as she rode her horse to the front, passing Zhao Xu's carriage.

She turned her head slightly and exchanged glances with Zhao Xu.

"Oh, is this the noble guest Freyrel has invited? Do you think you can win the key to the 'Dragon Battle'?"
Here is the translation:

As soon as Zhao Xu heard these words, a fleeting thought flashed through his mind - the grand event held every five years in Oulu City, which he had forgotten, coincidentally taking place this month.

In the previous life, five years after the conclusion of the Seal Magic War, there was no "Dragon Hunt" event held, and Zhao Xu had never attended this grand festival in Oulu City.

"Don't dare, how dare I compete with Miss for it," he said.

Freel didn't expect to encounter this prickly existence.

Furue was the sole heir to the Tang Dynasty, and until her younger sister gave birth to another heir, Furue's status remained unchallenged, even as a private daughter.

At this moment, he dared not reveal the name "Zhong Xia" inside the carriage, as this would directly trigger a massive wave, and the alliance was searching everywhere for this target.

Before Tang De saw "Zhong Xia", his heart could not settle.

Just then, Furue didn't continue speaking, let out a silver bell-like laughter, and then rode her white-as-snow celestial horse towards the front mansion, followed by her numerous attendants.

"This is our alliance leader Tang De's daughter, Furue, Miss," Freel said, introducing Zhao Xu with a polite smile, but didn't mention the reason he didn't want to introduce them.

"Yes, I've heard a little," Zhao Xu said, still gazing straight ahead.

This was someone he knew.

However, at this moment, he heard a voice in his ear, "Hmph, liar, come find me tonight, or I'll expose your past at the Star Lake, Zhong Xia the wizard."
