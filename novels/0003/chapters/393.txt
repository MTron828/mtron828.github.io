Chapter 394: Life Energy

The tunnel leading to the lair of the variant scorpion was not a smoothly paved road, but rather a rugged path that corresponded to the unique features of the variant scorpion's body. It was a challenging route that required tremendous agility.

"It's amazing that they were able to force their way through," Zhao Xu evaluated.

With his "Divine Step" ability, which granted him perpetual and flawless mobility, he could manipulate his flight to navigate the treacherous tunnel.

However, Viola, who was wearing a heavy armor set, was finding it difficult to move through the tunnel. Even with the armor infused with secret silver that made it lighter, it was still a struggle.

After trying several times, Viola decided to use her shape-shifting ability to grow her own wings from her back, just like Zhao Xu, and began to flutter around in mid-air.

As a demon, Viola was naturally able to fly.

Zhao Xu also noticed the wings that had appeared behind Viola, which were unlike the grotesque, bat-like wings of ordinary demons. Instead, they resembled a swirling vortex of deep purple particles, creating a stunning visual effect.

Zhao Xu thought that maybe the wings were created by the mysterious container created by the night, which might be different from ordinary demons. He didn't ask too many questions.

As they flew together, they didn't see any signs of the variant scorpion. It seemed like they had stumbled upon an empty lair.

"We may have entered through a different entrance," Zhao Xu analyzed.

From the time they entered the tunnel to now, they had been flying for at least half an hour.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The adventurers who rush to claim the treasure chest in the nest without the condition of flight will undoubtedly spend more time and may not be able to return in two hours.

Even during their escape from the nest, they may have been killed off early on.

"The monster itself will arrange several exits in the nest, even in the nest of unintelligent insects," Vivian added.

This means that they and the adventurers are not taking the same route.

Because Zhao Xu used the positioning technique to locate the treasure chest, which is a straight-line distance, and they themselves also deviated from the entrance of the nest by several hundred meters, while the underground tunnel is twisted and winding, it is possible that the route is longer and farther from the treasure chest.

Vivian's flight process was already affected by carrying a heavy full-body armor, even with the secret silver mixed in to reduce the weight, and she felt a hint of fatigue.

This is also the norm for adventurers to consider factors such as physical strength, diet, breathing, sleep, and comfort level when carrying loads.

Unless you are a noble child, you would carry a dimension bag to reduce the load, wear a breathless stone on your head, and a stone that doesn't need to eat.

"Uh?"

Suddenly, Vivian, who was flying low over the flat ground, slowed down her flight speed and hovered in mid-air, observing the scene below.

It was a deeply excavated pit, with the pit walls polished to a smooth finish, making it difficult to climb.

The pit was filled with a pile of various corpses from below.

From the spines, it could be roughly distinguished that most of them were violent animals, with some animal legs even higher than human legs.

However, with the aid of Zhao Xu's dark vision, he could also distinguish many human skulls, including those of half-human dwarves.

"It's a bit strange," Vivian frowned her eyebrows.
Here is the translation:

As she watched this scene, she directly pulled out her original divine avenger, and her killing intent began to manifest.

"No."

Zhao Xu explained, "Large natural creatures can swallow and digest the entire thing, but those of medium and small sizes cannot, and will leave behind these skeletal remains."

His tone was slightly cold and carried a hint of cruelty.

In Zhao Xu's previous adventures, he had mostly explored the surface and towns, rarely venturing into the lairs of such monsters.

However, he had previously explored similar locations in his past life, and had seen many such pits filled with corpses, which were leftovers from the monsters' meals.

Humans had dominated the Earth's food chain since they developed weapons and fire, and had brutally exterminated various large animals.

For example, there were no mammoths like the ones in zoos today, because ancient humans had long since eaten them all.

However, for Arthur, the original purpose of establishing towns was to gather and defend against monsters, and even towns outside the city would rarely be built in uninhabited areas.

Arthur's wilderness was a place where people really died.

There were countless terrifying and powerful monsters roaming the area.

The pit of corpses before them was showcasing the brutal results of the mutant scorpions' hunting.

Ordinary civilians without self-defense abilities, even if they learned to hunt like ancient humans with bows and arrows, would still be no match for these monsters with their natural armor and damage reduction abilities.

Metal is the first killer of protein, and has never been wrong.

However, when humans who possessed the same natural armor and damage reduction abilities as the monsters encountered them, before they evolved to a professional level, they were powerless to resist.

"Let's keep going," Zhāo Xù said.

For insects without intelligence, these are their food, and he's furious, but it's meaningless.

"Uh?"

Suddenly, Wēi Wēiān let out a soft sigh and looked towards a shadowy spot amidst a pile of fragmented rocks.

A small, ordinary-looking scorpion was hiding there, and when it saw Zhāo Xù and his companions, it quickly burrowed into the loose soil.

The tunnel they flew through was a path used by massive, giant, and super-giant scorpions, while these small and tiny scorpions had their own unique, intricate pathways.

Zhāo Xù entered this nest without putting too much effort into reconnaissance.

Once the battle breaks out, it's basically a fight to the death within this nest.

So, he needs to obtain a lasting close-range combat ability.

Just as Wēi Wēiān was about to fly over to slash the small scorpion, Zhāo Xù directly manipulated the "Cloud of Knife" spell on his body, surrounding himself with a cloud of sword qi.

In an instant, the invisible sword qi shot out.

The small scorpion, which had already burrowed halfway into the soft soil, with a body width of over five centimeters, was cut in half by the sword qi.

Even the seemingly hard exoskeleton couldn't withstand the sharp and deadly slash, derived from his magical ability.

The scorpion's body was cut in half, and the stinger fell off.

The cut surface was extremely smooth and flat, and only after it separated did the insect's own dark fluid begin to ooze out.

The small and tiny scorpions, with their lives basically unable to withstand Zhāo Xù's single blow.

Moreover, the sword qi that Zhāo Xù released each time was limitless, available at any time and without interruption.
Here is the translation of the given text:

He is like having a powerful archer constantly stationed on his body, ready to unleash an arrow at any moment, without any loss. A small, mutated scorpion with a defense level of up to 14, even a 1st-level warrior might not be able to hit it. His innate attack power is as high as 20 levels, and he can slice the scorpion like cutting watermelon.

Even in the cold winter, there is still some heat in the tunnel, and no one can be seen. Otherwise, he would be extremely surprised that a two-ring spell can cause such power.

"Will you get stronger?" Vivian asked, noticing Zhao Xu's slightly dazed expression.

"No, I just felt a sudden surge of life energy," Zhao Xu explained.

Players are extremely skeptical about whether Arthur has experience points.

However, Zhao Xu has already realized that experience points are another form of "life energy" in Arthur.

One of the necessary conditions for leveling up is to accumulate enough life energy, and then you can reach a new life level.

In general, accumulating life energy by eating, drinking, and feeling oneself's professional abilities is also a way to accumulate life energy.

However, the fastest way to accumulate life energy is still by defeating monsters.

However, simply accumulating life energy through monster hunting is only a necessary condition for leveling up, and the "insight" to break through the boundaries is still indispensable.

Therefore, warriors in the game can level up faster because they can accumulate life energy while fighting monsters and gaining battle experience.

Many times, 30 years old is the stage when a wizard has just started going on adventures.

But 30 years old is also the age when a 7th-level warrior is tired of fighting and preparing to return to his hometown to rest.

Zhao Xu just casually chopped down, and suddenly felt a surge of life energy drifting over from that mutated scorpion.
Here is the translation of the text:

Lakshmi had some doubts about the fragments of the god of death on his body. At this time, Lakshmi had already entered the critical stage of fusion and couldn't chat with him anymore, nor could she find someone to clarify her doubts.

"Life energy? Jumping?" Vivian's originally tense expression relaxed slightly.

"The Lady of the Night once told me that some spirits can see the flow of life energy," Vivian said.

"Yes."

Zhao Xiu heard Vivian's words, but didn't delve deeper.

At this moment, in front of him were hundreds of "mutated scorpions" of medium to small size, crowded in the passage. They were stacked like blocks of drilling tools, moving back and forth between each other. The scorpions' eyes were transparent like pale yellow glass beads, fixed on them with a consistent rhythm.

In the absence of sufficient defense, ants bite to death, and in Arthur's battles, they fight with the weak against the strong.

These mutated scorpions waved their front claws and tail claws, ready to launch an attack on them at any moment. However, Zhao Xiu didn't show the slightest nervousness, but instead watched everything with great interest. Unfortunately, it was too little.
