Chapter 044: Provisional Priest

Zhao Xu is accustomed to controlling his excitement after experiencing the surprise of the past few days.

He glanced at his character panel to check his spell data.

【Priest:
Level 0 spell slot: 3=3 (profession)
Level 1 spell slot: 2=1 (profession) +1 (perception)】

The information is similar to what he saw before, but the status is gray and inactive, just like when he logged in this morning before meditating. His wife in his past life had received priest training, and he has a general idea of the process.

Priests obtain spells through meditation and prayer. They don't need to research spells, as long as they meditate at a fixed time and receive the gift of the gods.

Even without 8 hours of rest, this is not a problem.

Zhao Xu's current state allows him to obtain a day's worth of spells after just one hour of meditation.

He originally lacked the last 1% of the possibility, but it was filled in the moment he crossed the church threshold, when the goddess descended.

Zhao Xu is now equivalent to a provisional priest, and he can become a priest with just a little more training.

This is hard to believe for him.

In his past life, he has seen many novice priests who spent years studying scriptures and understanding divine teachings, but even they failed to become a 1st-level priest.

Even with the gods being lenient towards players, the success rate of becoming a 1st-level priest is still low.
Here is the translation of the text:

Aside from the player's innate self-awareness and centering, the main thing is the opportunity for advancement, which is beyond human capabilities.

This is also the reason why his previous wife gave up on the path of being a pastor.

Although Zhao Xu has this extraordinary phenomenon on his body, he knows that silence is the best choice at this moment.

This opportunity is too subtle.

He wants to pursue a career as a scholar of the scriptures, and being a pastor is sufficient.

According to what he knows, the abilities sent by the pastor are enough for him to return to his original state.

At this moment, everyone in the church is standing in reverence.

In the endless ringing of the bell, they are all silently praying to the goddess in their hearts.

Zhao Xu does not know if he has been pulled through the river of time to see the goddess before she became divine.

At this moment, his reverence for the goddess is far from the strong reverence he felt before.

The closer the distance, the harder it is to feel reverence.

This is also the reason why the clergy respect the goddess but do not necessarily believe in her.

Zhao Xu dare not assume that the goddess has a request for him; he has no such arrogance.

He is more aware that the goddess needs his help.

This sense of urgency is so pressing that he cannot wait until he has made some progress before intervening.

The only thing he can guess is that his identity as a time-traveler can be a variable of fate.

He is like a pawn that has suddenly appeared in a chessboard that has already taken shape, although his power is very weak, but it can stir up a storm.

Zhao Xu is not like other believers, who proudly look around, but humbly lowers his head.

This is the mainstream of Arthurian legend.

Even if his previous wife did not become a pastor, she remained a devout believer.

In Arthurian legend, after the death of the soul, the spirit usually floats to the outer layer of the astral plane that is suitable for the soul.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's the same face that Zhao Xu saw at the time, the outermost circle of the circular diagram.

Believers will receive the protection of the divine and be admitted to the divine realm.

Therefore, aside from the powerful wizard who can't die, many people are seeking a god or faith that matches their nature.

No one wants to die without consciousness, with their soul drifting aimlessly in the afterlife, and even falling into the depths of hell, becoming a prey for others.

So Zhao Xu didn't doubt the sincerity of the prayer sounds resonating in his ear.

Finally, the bell stopped ringing, taking with it a certain melancholy thought.

"The goddess has left," a voice echoed in Zhao Xu's mind, sounding like Lei An's.

At this point, Zhao Xu was no stranger to it; he knew that Lei An had released a spell.

He glanced at the information panel on the character card.

His dynamic was topped with a prompt: "You are currently connected to Lei An through the mind-link spell."

These dynamics were a reflection of Zhao Xu's consciousness.

If Zhao Xu misinterpreted or misused the spell, the dynamic would also flash an error message.

The information panel cannot be used to verify reality.

It's impossible to judge whether he is truly within this spell and communicating with the real Lei An or not.

However, after Zhao Xu focused his attention on the words "mind-link," he successfully connected with Lei An.

He could even refuse the connection through this method.

"So fast?" Zhao Xu pondered for a moment before using neutral language.

The divine will not read the thoughts of these mortal beings, but mentioning the name of the divine will be known to the divine.

All spoken words will be known.
Here is the translation:

As the words that come after it will be heard, "Elder brother, today is not our gathering, but a gathering of others. Otherwise, I won't rush to appear, and I'll wait for you to hurry over. I'll also make sure you don't get a reward from Noja."

Rein looked at Zhao Xuan with a carefree expression, calling him "Elder brother." Zhao Xuan was taken aback by Rein's words.

Who would have thought that this 30-year-old mage was actually much older.

Zhao Xuan was still immersed in the sadness of Noja's departure and had forgotten that Noja had promised him a reward.

"What reward is it?" Rein asked, and Zhao Xuan was curious, even though he was talking to himself.

Noja was a legendary figure who could casually take out a +12 intelligence headband with magical properties. He gave Zhao Xuan something, but it wasn't just a +6 intelligence bonus, but also a +2 overall bonus.

"I don't know how, but Noja's gifts are all handmade and have her unique style. She wouldn't show them to me. I think we'll meet again after you complete your priest training, and then she'll give them to you."

"However, we're still late, and we haven't reached the innermost part of the temple. It's easier to get the attention of the goddess there, and you might even become a qualified priest and gain divine powers directly."

"Temple?" Zhao Xuan asked quickly.

"Yes, the temple is open today, with 300 slots. I used my privilege to reserve a middle seat for you. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. Hurry up and go to the temple. The divine energy there is still strong, which can increase your chances of gaining divine powers."
Here is the translation of the text:

Lei Anxin said inwardly: "At the beginning, those who didn't make it onto the list of 300 people are all waiting for this opportunity. Otherwise, wouldn't there be too many people squeezing together for a lively atmosphere?"

Zhao Xu was astonished and said: "Can't we just divide the holy water?"

"What, dividing holy water? That's just a gimmick that can only deal 2D4 (2-8) damage to evil spirits and demonic creatures. I can just casually cast a fireball spell for 10D6 (10-60) damage, and I can even absorb half of the holy damage. Are you saying you have a special fondness for the legendary succubus mistress? Use it to educate her?"

"Oh, forget it, let's stop talking and go grab a spot," Lei Anxin suddenly thought of something and quickly turned Zhao Xu's attention.

"Don't bother going now."

"What?"

"I just got the divine art just now."

"..."

"I said, I just got the divine art."

His voice echoed through the empty space between the two people.
