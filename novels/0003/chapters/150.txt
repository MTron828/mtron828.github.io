Chapter 151: Level 3 Mage

Tasi, a 2nd-level mage who had been in the floating city for many years, looked at the three players standing beside him and said, "I've never heard of someone pretending to be a lecturer here."

Having been in the academic department for over a decade, Tasi had worked hard to become a 2nd-level manager, and his diligence had paid off.

Among the three players, Jiang Shan, who had clashed with Zhao Xu, was the leader. As the son of a wealthy family, he was trying his hand at games for the first time and was feeling frustrated.

In this floating city, any NPC you looked at was someone you couldn't provoke.

Arthur also hadn't opened up the mall, and there was no way to recharge. Even the luxury edition that Jiang Shan had bought for 300 yuan, which included a set of equipment, couldn't be sold on the market.

So Jiang Shan, a wealthy player, was feeling that the game was this difficult for the first time.

Jiang Shan had contacted some gold-making studios, but most of them were far away and couldn't deliver the limited gold coins to the floating city.

After Jiang Shan heard that Wang Qingwei had obtained a "Mastery Recovery Pearl" and contacted her, Wang Qingwei directly rejected his purchase request.

Today, Jiang Shan had come in person to negotiate with Wang Qingwei, determined to crush her psychologically.

His father had told him since he was young that most transactions that didn't go through were because they couldn't reach the opponent's psychological bottom line.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even his goal has gone beyond just recovering a pearl that restores magic power.

Wang Congwei is extremely famous among players in the floating city, and if he can unconditionally cooperate with him, he believes that his plan to spend money will definitely yield a high return.

However, when he arrived at the lectern, he discovered that Wang Congwei and a novice player were chatting and laughing together.

The feeling of someone else touching his beloved thing suddenly stimulated Jiangshan.

Later, he saw the player still dared to take the lectern and scold them away, and Jiangshan followed suit.

Because he was clear that the strict rules of the floating city would make the cunning player suffer greatly, and even be kicked out.

At this time, Tasi was leading Jiangshan and three others to the 91st lectern.

Today, Tasi was on night duty and couldn't go back to celebrate his daughter's birthday, feeling increasingly annoyed, and was looking for a target to vent his frustration.

"So this 'Transmission Beacon' spell, through this nested structure, can allow the information to be transmitted and branched out, allowing six extra people to obtain information."

At this time, Zhao Xu was starting to analyze the first-level spell "Transmission Beacon" mentioned in the lecture notes.

At first, the lecturer Buroan had not seen this spell before.

The only information available is the name of the spell and some scattered information about the transmission portal.
So there are many errors in the lecture notes about this spell.

Zhao Xu then decided to focus on this and arrange the subsequent content accordingly.

At this time, many magic students in the audience looked surprised, while Aiswich and Wang Congwei took out their notes, making corrections and taking notes at the same time.
Here is the translation of the text:

The chief administrator, Tasi, continued to listen to Zhao Xu's explanation for a full minute before turning back to look at Jiang Shan and the others. He gazed at them coldly and said, "Do you think this lecturer is a substitute for a player?"

Jiang Shan, who was also stunned, looked at Zhao Xu, who was confidently explaining the principles of magic on stage. Jiang Shan, who had been firm in his stance, was now unable to suppress his doubts.

"That's definitely not a player," Jiang Shan panted, trying to reassure himself.

"You should know the rules of the Floating City," he said. "As long as you're in an academic lecture hall, the lecturer has absolute authority. Even if he thinks you've offended him by entering first with your left foot, he has the right to expel you."

Tasi bit his teeth and warned Jiang Shan and the others, saying, "If you cause any more trouble, it won't just be expelled from the lecture hall."

As Jiang Shan's two attendants quickly apologized to Tasi and hurriedly pulled Jiang Shan away, who was still muttering to himself.

After the three of them left, Tasi turned back to look at Zhao Xu, who was still standing on stage.

He recalled the "transmission marker" spell that Zhao Xu had described to him, a first-level spell that could be placed on a transmission portal to determine the direction and distance of the portal.

Transmission portals were a strategic asset of the Floating City, and even the Magic Guild's branch office had to go through strict approval procedures to establish a transmission portal. Spells related to transmission portals were even more rigorous in terms of approval.

As one of the comprehensive logistics administrators of the lecture hall, Tasi knew that the originally scheduled lecturer was Bloan, but Bloan was injured and was replaced at the last minute by a lecturer named "Feng".

Tasi knew Bloan, a 5th-level mage who was a bit eccentric.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Bolaun's knowledge and expertise in low-level magic are unparalleled among these ordinary magicians. Even some mid-level magicians would seek his guidance on a certain advanced magic spell they've never seen before. But has Bolaun's skill level really reached this level? His notes have even touched on the teleportation series of spells, including the seal of the Flying City. Thinking about this, Tasi couldn't help but shake his head. He didn't know how Bolaun could handle all of this.

Just then, Tasi was about to walk forward when he heard the next sentence from the podium. "When it comes to illusions, let's discuss the second-level spell 'Invisibility'." Zhao Xu suddenly said this on the podium, and he drew a simple outline of the structure of the Invisibility spell on the blackboard with a black pen.

Having mastered the ninth-level spell "Ultimate Invisibility," Zhao Xu had personally experienced how the entire series of Invisibility spells layer upon layer. He was deeply moved by this. In the final scroll space, Zhao Xu's own casting of spells had a strong sense of feedback.

Compared to using his wand to cast spells, the effect was completely different. When using his wand, he didn't know how the spell was flowing or what changes it was undergoing. Because the spell was stored in the wand, he was essentially just lighting a fire, without knowing the internal structure. However, when he cast spells in the final scroll, the spells seemed to be released from his mind, as if he had prepared them himself. Each time Zhao Xu cast a spell, he felt a strong impact.

Using a wand or scroll to cast spells is like playing a shooting game, where one press of a mouse is like firing a gun.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu practices his magic in the final dimension of the astral plane, which is equivalent to actually going to a real shooting range and performing a live-fire exercise. Therefore, when he is creating the structure of his invisible magic, he has a strong feeling of anticipation.

Because this structure is the foundation, he has a clear understanding of what path he will take in the future.

Although he has not yet mastered any level three or higher magic structure, it is still the same.

He is like someone who has seen the future Apple iPhone and then returns to the past to see the Symbian phone.

Even though Zhao Xu has no experience related to the smartphone industry, he can accurately predict the future development direction of smartphones.

At this time, Zhao Xu's heart is filled with enthusiasm, and he begins to expand the content of his invisible magic and analyze the core of the magic.

Many magic apprentices in the audience can't keep up with the pace, and some can only barely copy the content on Zhao Xu's whiteboard and then review it carefully.

On the other hand, Wang Qingwei and Esveil are completely focused on listening to Zhao Xu's analysis of the magic structure.

"Isn't this just a summary of level one magic?" Esveil is a bit puzzled by Zhao Xu's sudden change. However, his hand is still rapidly recording.

"This should be the case, as the 'Invisible Illusion' and 'Easy Transformation' magic in level one are both more relevant to 'Breaking the Invisibility' magic in the prophecy system."

Zhao Xu suddenly demonstrates a magic transformation on stage.

At this moment, many people in the audience take a few deep breaths.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The "Invisibility Technique" from the Illusionary Arts and the "Deciphering of Invisibility" from the Divination Arts can be considered opposing magical techniques. They also have ways to reverse-engineer each other, but the methods are complex and the conditions for achievement are difficult.

It's not impossible to reverse-engineer "Deciphering of Invisibility" using "Invisibility Technique", but it's mostly done by high-level mages.

This has given the students in the audience a sense of reverence and admiration for the high-level mages. They didn't expect that Professor Bloan was absent, but a high-level mage familiar with low-level magical techniques was sent to explain, and he was treated like a beloved son.

High-level mages sometimes may not understand certain low-level magical techniques as well as some experienced low-level mages.

It's not that high-level mages are not intelligent, but they have more efficient high-level magical techniques that replace them, so they don't need to optimize old systems anymore.

After finishing his speech, Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a deep breath in excitement.

He had just mastered the 6th-level magical technique "True Knowledge" and had realized the connection between "Invisibility Technique" and "Deciphering of Invisibility".

As a 6th-level divination magical technique, "True Knowledge" can decipher all illusions and has a strong effect.

Some people even joked that if "True Knowledge" didn't exist, at least the number of students choosing to specialize in illusions would double.

Zhao Xu also turned the page of his notes, preparing to continue with the next level of magical technique. At that moment, he glanced out the window and saw a mage bowing to him. However, Zhao Xu was still busy with the lecture and didn't ask many questions.

At that moment, the mage outside was crying tears of joy.

After finishing the magical analysis, he finally reached level 3 after 10 years of stagnation at level 2.
