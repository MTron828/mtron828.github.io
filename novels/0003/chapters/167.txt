Chapter 168: Linked Tasks

For the next period of time, Zhao Xu was immersed in the entire legendary library's collection, even to the point of forgetting his surroundings.

Especially, he discovered numerous powerful rituals.

Although rituals consumed more time and energy compared to magic, they were also a rare opportunity for low-level players to surpass their current level and obtain powerful abilities.

If it weren't for the "Legendary Library" avatar, Luo Duo, who personally came to remind him that time was up, Zhao Xu would have had to stay in the library and sleep on the floor.

Then, Zhao Xu and Luo Duo confirmed their plan for entering the library and slowly recited the password "Luo Duo is the most lovable." As they parted ways, Zhao Xu's consciousness was projected into the space of the legendary library.

At that time, Zhao Xu's physical body directly entered the spirit realm.

Zhao Xu was only studying the 9th layer of the knowledge library and did not need to use complex rituals.

Later, unless he reached the 9th layer again and shouted the password, he would have to set up the ritual himself using materials.

This meant that Zhao Xu could not use this trick to escape in the middle of a battle.

When Zhao Xu returned to the Pentagonal Spire, he felt that his thought process had changed.

When he left the "Final Scroll" space, he obtained countless spells and thought only about using magic to solve problems.

When he left the "Morlin Monument", he thought about how to maximize his strength using leveling abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

Now that he has left the "Legend Library", the most frequent thought in his mind is the mysterious rituals and various secret knowledge that are beyond comprehension.

It's as if the mysterious world of King Arthur has begun to unfold before him at this moment.

From now on, Zhao Xu will have a secret channel to obtain mysterious information, no longer limited to Anzhiya and knowledge verification skills.

Next, Zhao Xu will return to the Fangjianta and report to Anzhiya about his experience of the day.

Anzhiya listened and just smiled, but didn't explain the true form of the guardian spirit of the Legend Library to Zhao Xu.

Instead, Anzhiya handed Zhao Xu a letter.

Zhao Xu thought back to the time when Anzhiya arranged for him to give a lecture, and that experience had also brought him significant benefits.

So Zhao Xu was very interested in opening the letter, but instead found it to be an intelligence report.

The report described a satellite town near Mistral City that had been attacked by bandits, and the town was seeking help from Mistral.

"Teacher, didn't you say that I shouldn't leave Mistral before reaching level 5?" Zhao Xu asked.

Although the satellite town is only a day's journey from Mistral, it's not very far, but this is still considered an adventure.

"This isn't an adventure, but a protection mission," Anzhiya said.

Protect?

Zhao Xu was taken aback, as a 3rd-level mage, he is usually the one who needs protection, not the other way around.

How can he be responsible for protecting others?

"It's called protection, but it's actually a test," Anzhiya said.

"The Floating City will periodically arrange special tasks for powerful mages to see blood," Anzhiya said.

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Arthur has always caused controversy due to his high level of realism in the bloody aspects, but the previous restrictions have not yet been officially implemented, so the public has already crossed the line.

Many warriors, who looked fearless when fighting monsters, were actually shocked when they came into contact with the monsters and saw the blood splattered everywhere.

After all, not everyone is born with the ability to kill pigs by hand like Zhao Xu did in his hometown.

"This time, we will arrange for 20 mages to conduct a blood test. Their task is to eliminate the target gang of bandits, and your task is to monitor them throughout and give them a score," said Anniya.

"Additionally, when they are near failure, you will take care of the remaining bandits," she added.

Zhao Xu only realized that he had been promoted to examiner and bodyguard.

Especially, he represented a different kind of power in scoring.

The Floating City needs to use testing to screen and filter out people who do not meet the standards, and then start training a portion of those who pass the test.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "The fate of those 20 people is almost in my hands."

But then he thought again and decided to decline, saying, "Master, the main reason is that my level is not high enough, and I am unable to cope with complex situations."

"I'm also lacking in stealth skills, and even if I raise my level, it won't make a difference," he added.

The duration of the stealth spell is one minute per caster level.

Zhao Xu was reluctant to follow the new mage apprentices, let alone stay with them for a day and a half.

It was impossible for his current spell to last for such a long time.

On the other hand, Zhao Xu also lacked the ability to eliminate large-scale bandits and did not know how to take direct action when necessary.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This time, if you agree, I'll give you two corresponding items that can enhance your magical power," Anzhiya added.

Zhao Xu looked at his equipment and found that there were still some empty slots.

"Teacher, what kind of magical equipment is this?" Zhao Xu asked, showing a look of anticipation.

After Zhao Xu's inquiry, Anzhiya smiled and hummed softly, seeming to be in a good mood. "One is a magical item that allows you to massacre bandits on a large scale. The other is a magical item that allows you to secretly monitor the situation."

"If you can secretly monitor the situation and help them resolve the bandits without revealing your identity, both magical items will belong to you," Anzhiya said.

"If you reveal your identity to resolve the bandits, you can choose one. But if there are casualties among the novice mages, both items will be cancelled," Anzhiya added.

Zhao Xu listened carefully and seemed to understand.

This was a welfare gift.
It was just a matter of doing a bit of hard work on the side.

"Okay, I'll take on this task," Zhao Xu said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu noticed that the two magical items Anzhiya described seemed to be suitable for large-scale battles.

At the same time, Anzhiya began to take something out of the dimensional bag. After a while, she placed a wand-like object on the table.

"This is the 'Eternal Wand', which comes with fireball magic," Anzhiya said as she handed Zhao Xu a wand.

On the tip of the wand, a pink crystal in the shape of a whirlpool was embedded.

Zhao Xu was surprised at this moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unbeknownst to him, the "Eternal Wand" he had just seen in the "Legendary Library" in the "Record of Various Powerful Magical Items" was now standing before him.

Compared to ordinary wands, the Eternal Wand could only store 3-level spells. Compared to ordinary wands, which had 50 shots of energy, the Eternal Wand had two distinct features.

One was that it could release spells twice a day until the end of the world, so it would not consume energy like an ordinary wand, and would be as useless as a ordinary branch with no magical power.

The second feature was that any mage could use this wand, regardless of their profession.

This meant that Zhao Xu faced the bandits with only 2 free and costless fireball spells.

This put his timing for casting spells to the test.

At the same time, it allowed him to touch the 5-level spell that he could not yet release, while also limiting his abuse of magic.

"Teacher, what else can I hide?" Zhao Xu asked.

Anzhiya smiled mysteriously and said, "You'll know when you go to Mistral below."

"Is it now? Can you sort out the tasks?"

"Sort out?" Zhao Xu asked.

Zhao Xu immediately understood that he was being asked to sort out the trend of the tasks that would come next.

Zhao Xu didn't think much about it and directly tore open the sealed envelope.

He immediately pulled out the personnel list.

When Zhao Xu looked at it, he couldn't help but laugh.

It seemed to be a coincidence, but Wang Qingwei and Esvi were in this team.

It was Zhao Xu's turn to evaluate the results of the blood-seeing task assigned to Wang Qingwei and others.

Zhao Xu also noticed that the man who had made him leave the classroom was among them.

It seemed like another stroke of luck had fallen into his lap.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Teacher, shall I go prepare now?" Zhao Xu asked An Shiniya.

"Not," An Shiniya replied.

At this time, An Shiniya looked at Zhao Xu, "Now, I'm going to release the second task to you."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, and there was another task within the task?

"Not matter whether you and the others eliminate those bandits or not, by the fourth day at noon, you, Lingwei, and Evischi, must all arrive at the 'Ferocious Beast Hole' marked on the map. Once you get there, someone will guide you to the next task." An Shiniya said.

Zhao Xu heard these words and his clear thinking suddenly became cloudy, as if the next task was the key one.

However, the "Arthur's Mysterious Places, Three Thousand Examples" book was not here, so he couldn't refer to it.

"Teacher, can we obtain anything from that hole?" Zhao Xu asked pointedly.

"Well, it's just that we can obtain an additional 'Steel Will' specialty. It's a prerequisite specialty for the Super Curse Master."
