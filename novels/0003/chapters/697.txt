Chapter 698: The Heavenly Giant's Palm

Zhao Xu gazed at the Ba Luoyan Mo's flying silhouette and seized the momentary gap, flapping his wings and swooping into the battlefield like a comet.

"Force Wall Technique!"

A gemstone powder scattered, creating an invisible and massive screen-like barrier that hung in mid-air.

The Force Wall, without leaving any trace, enveloped the Ba Luoyan Mo, and it crashed its head against the wall.

The impact, equivalent to nearly four to five tons, struck the wall, which was impervious to any damage. The Force Wall effectively blocked the Ba Luoyan Mo's advance.

The intense pain caused the Ba Luoyan Mo to let out a furious roar.

It glared at the surroundings, brandishing its +1 fiery whip with incredible flexibility, producing a swooshing and crackling sound as flames danced and fluttered around it.

The whip was covered in razor-sharp hooks and hard, spherical objects, filling the air with a cacophony of crashing sounds and the Ba Luoyan Mo's enraged bellowing.

"What kind of crawling creature dares to attack me?" it roared.

As it roared, the Ba Luoyan Mo's body continued to burn with intense flames, as if it had become a furnace. The Saint Envoy in its grasp let out a pained cry, and the white wings on its back turned a charred black.

The fiery body was one of the Ba Luoyan Mo's supernatural abilities, causing it to take 6-36 points of damage (6D6) each round when it was grasped. Few living beings could withstand such destruction.

Looking around at the unresponsive crowd, the Ba Luoyan Mo launched its True Knowledge technique.

In an instant, it saw Zhao Xu, who had sneaked up on him, and burst out laughing, "So, you're just a ordinary mage from the heavenly realm?"
Here is the translation:

Upon seeing Zhao Xü's attack, this Balroth mage, despite its joking words, displayed a formal attitude and directly unleashed a spell-like ability, "Profane God's Tongue". Within a 12-meter radius around it, a devastatingly evil and polluting sound filled the air, capable of corrupting the souls of even good-hearted priests. The sound was so filthy that it made them want to cry and feel guilty towards the gods.

The effects of the spell were death, weakness, dizziness, and numbness, all of which were extremely detrimental. Any living being with a life force below the 20th level of the Balroth mage's spellcasting ability would be affected by the spell.

As a 10th-level player, Zhao Xü was just 10 levels short of the Balroth mage's level, and was caught in the middle.

The "Profane God's Tongue" was an unblockable effect.

After the spell energy penetrated Zhao Xü's meager 20-point spell resistance and shattered his barrier, the Balroth mage continued to expand its territory.

Zhao Xü, however, merely raised an eyebrow.

He didn't even bother to use any methods to counter the sound wave and instead directly charged at the Balroth mage's fiery body with his sword, relying solely on his physical strength to withstand all negative effects.

As the death energy spread, Zhao Xü's pre-emptive buff, the "Shield of Immortality", continued to exert its powerful effects, effectively blocking the impending death effect.

"Ah?" This was completely unexpected by the Balroth mage, as non-evil beings would usually avoid this spell. How could someone physically withstand its effects?

Moreover, the opponent was not a priest who could remove numerous negative states. Once affected, there was no way to counter it, and death was inevitable.

However, Zhao Xü merely raised an eyebrow and said, "Iron Heart!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The strongest buff technique is effortlessly executed by Zhao Xu, directly shattering three major negative states: weakness, dizziness, and numbness.

In the end, Zhao Xu's sword pierced deeply, like spring sprouts after a rainstorm, each stroke piercing deeper and higher.

The powerful attack exploded!

The charge exploded!

The lion's charge! Continuous strikes! Leading the charge!

At this moment, Zhao Xu's combat instincts can switch seamlessly between techniques without needing to think, showcasing his increasingly refined killing tactics.

This Balroth demon, originally with a blood volume of around 300 HP, was in a very safe area. With its own powerful defense and damage reduction abilities, it was almost trivial for it to withstand the attacks of thousands of enemies. This is also the basis for Balroth demons to become deep-seated evil generals.

However, after Zhao Xu's successive one-hit kills, this Balroth demon could only let out pained wails while watching its life force being cut down.

290 HP was instantly cut down to almost half of its life.

The second sword strike was fatal!

In the midst of the Balroth demon's incredulous screams and curses, a blinding flash of light exploded, dealing 100 points of lethal damage, equivalent to a tornado that swept through 30 meters of area, affecting all living beings.

Moreover, the two weapons held by the Balroth demon both directly exploded and crumbled to dust.

It was better to burn the pearl and jade than to let Zhao Xu take advantage of this.

Zhao Xu was also seeing the Balroth demon's "burning explosion" ability for the first time, a desperate means of self-destruction at the brink of death.

However, the damage was still too low for Zhao Xu, who could only wrinkle his brow and couldn't even come close to causing fatal injuries.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As the scene unfolded, another Balroth demon, still excited, released its "Soul Capture" spell, letting out a loud, tense scream and using its "Higher Transmission" ability to prepare to escape. However, Zhao Xu seized the opportunity and instantly unleashed the "Dimension Anchor" spell.

As the green light precisely hit the almost-completed Balroth demon, its transmission energy suddenly dissipated. A hollow feeling suddenly spread, as if it had struggled to escape but was kicked back by someone's merciless kick.

The transmission-failed Balroth demon's gaze was fixed on Zhao Xu, and it let out a series of incantations in a fiery tone, as if cursing Zhao Xu, yet with an unusual melodic quality, like a prayer or a declaration.

Zhao Xu instantly sensed the subtle implications and quickly raised his hand to cast a spell against the Balroth demon.

"Justice Hammer!"
The spell took effect immediately, causing a rapid response and dealing massive damage, equivalent to one-hundredth of the Balroth demon's strength.

Zhao Xu's first reaction was to cast this spell.

Instantly, the two forces merged and entered the Balroth demon's body, causing it to slowly dissolve. Then, it suddenly exploded into countless small, high-jointed models that self-destructed, triggering a fierce battle.

In the blink of an eye, only one remained, then transformed into a faint smoke and disappeared.

Immediately after, the Balroth demon's jade-like body began to disintegrate, as if the "Incineration and Disintegration" effect from the "Divine Judgment" spell had started.

However, this time Zhao Xu was far enough away to avoid any effect.

But after the flames dissipated, the dark area still reverberated with the demon's prayer-like incantations, lingering for a long time.

It was as if it was still singing a hymn in this temporal space.
Here is the translation of the text:

The high-ranking devil, Belial, who is the object of prayer for those who seek to ascend to a higher realm, is undoubtedly a formidable foe. Even the lords of the underworld take notice of the disturbance here, and more and more angels and saints gather to observe the anomaly.

The air is thick with tension as the sound of a melody resonates, like a trap being sprung. Everyone senses that the deceased Belial has successfully summoned reinforcements, and the battle is about to erupt.

In the next instant, the location where Belial disappeared suddenly bursts into a brilliant green palm, charging towards Zhao Xu at incredible speed.

Meanwhile, the sound of the great bell tolls, "Are you the one who just killed my follower?"

Zhao Xu, who has long since sensed the danger, instinctively activates the "Unlimited Door".

In the blink of an eye, Zhao Xu teleports himself a distance of nearly hundreds of meters, narrowly avoiding the giant green palm that was about to crush him.

However, the cliff behind him is not so lucky, with only a few nearby saints being killed by the palm's disintegrating power. The wall facing them is also shattered, as if it has been ripped apart.

Zhao Xu cannot help but wonder which underworld lord is behind this.

One thing is certain, however: it is not someone like Glaz and Dymo, who have clashed with him before. Otherwise, they would have used a single, massive hand to crush him, rather than summoning an army of millions of demons to descend upon him. They would have also used their powers to reposition the battlefield, subjecting Zhao Xu to a realm even more torturous than hell itself.

Zhao Xu's heart beats with trepidation.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because a new, all-green, gigantic palm appeared beside him once again, bringing with it the momentum of opening the sky and the earth, and a distant, pale-green giant palm was also synchronously rushing towards him. It was clear that he couldn't kill him on the spot, as these giant palms would only keep multiplying!

"Transmission technique!"

At this moment, Zhao Xu didn't bother to pretend and didn't intend to engage in a battle with a deep-sea lord from afar. He directly used the teleportation technique to send himself 500 kilometers away.

As he transmitted the energy, his entire body was enveloped by a concentrated beam of energy, causing his figure to suddenly disappear.

The two giant palms collided head-on, creating a massive, tumultuous vortex that dispersed half of the approaching heavenly army. At this moment, a cold, condescending smile lingered in the void.

"You think you can escape like this?"

As for Zhao Xu, he flew up and then descended again, causing his eardrums to ache. He reappeared on a small path in a tunnel-like crack in the earth, having navigated through the vast, 3,000-kilometer-long map of the deep abyss. Otherwise, he would have teleported into the rocky interior and wouldn't have been able to escape.

However, the cold sensation on Zhao Xu's back suddenly surged, as if a fine, hair-like needle was piercing his skin.

"Sudden explosion!"
"Random portal!"

Zhao Xu didn't even turn his head, directly relying on his instincts to release the "Sudden Explosion" and then, with the timing of a thousand jun, he successfully executed the teleportation technique.

Not too much, not too little, he had moved 500 meters, and the Zhao Xu who had been hiding on the edge of a crevice also directly moved to mid-air.

However, when he looked towards the area where he had just sat down, he found that it had already turned into a void.
Here is the translation of the text:

All the thick walls, narrow and winding paths that have withstood the winds and rains of time, and the horizontal stone bridges that have witnessed the passage of years, have all become powder at this moment. They are crushed by the massive palm of destruction.

At this instant, Zhao Xu feels that this massive palm is akin to a magical shadow, changing from one to two, two to four, and four to eight, and directly spreading out a network of heaven and earth, surrounding him with a circle of threads.

Zhao Xu curses under his breath, "Is this the Demon Lord from Journey to the West? Is he going to put on a show like Monkey King and the White Bone Demon?"

He feels that the magical creature on his body has activated the "Healing Minor Injuries" skill, removing the negative effect of dizziness.

However, Zhao Xu realizes that these Demon Lords' tactics have gone beyond magic and even beyond imagination, and are not easy to deal with.

Because the opponent is no longer driven by basic interests.

Zhao Xu then clenches his teeth and looks towards the narrow crevices that are already being covered by the massive palm.

No one has ever explored the depths of the fourth layer of the Abyss.

As for the "Gateway to the Netherworld" spell, it requires accurate location to open it in a specific location. Similarly, teleportation spells have distance limitations.

Zhao Xu grits his teeth and casts the "Teleportation" spell towards the direction of the Abyss, which is as dark as night.

Five thousand kilometers, full throttle!

This is the pride of a 33-level mage.

The massive palm collides with each other again, but Zhao Xu has already completed the spell and instantly teleports away several thousand kilometers.
Here is the translation of the text:

This scale is already at the level of the Earth's radius, and I could circle the entire Earth three times.

Just as I landed on this piece of land, I glanced back at the direction I came from, and before I could even catch my breath, I once again deployed the "Transference Technique" and sent myself to the next node.

I repeated this process!

Every 5,000 kilometers, one minute of continuous transmission is equivalent to 50,000 kilometers. In one hour, it's 300 million kilometers!

This distance is equivalent to the distance light travels in 10 seconds. In the original universe, the distance from the sun to the Earth is only about 8 minutes and 45 seconds.

But I discovered that behind me, a shadowy, green, giant palm kept appearing, multiplying endlessly like a continuous cell division.

Moreover, this demon lord, who has never met me, doesn't seem like a demon at all, with enough patience and energy to toy with me.

Finally, after continuously using my latent potential and transmitting for hours, my magical abilities reached their limit, and my mental state became unbearable.

I gave up and turned around, facing the giant palm once again and asking, "Tell me, who are you?"

At this moment, the row of giant palms, numbering over a hundred, finally stopped moving, maintaining the same posture and gazing at me with a slight bow.

"You truly surpass my expectations, having such a stamina-enhancing spell."

"It should be me asking you, who are you?"
