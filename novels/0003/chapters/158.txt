Chapter 159: Advanced Secrets

The Truth Hall is the highest core area of the Floating City, equivalent to its brain. The core of the Floating City's mystical lock and the energy center both extend from the Truth Hall.

The headquarters of the Mage Association and all its affiliated institutions are located within the Truth Hall. On the other hand, the various logistical institutions responsible for serving the entire Floating City are located on the surface of the city.

Zhao Xu and An Xinyue went through several registration procedures, and even had to produce his Mage Badge and the silver chip containing the secret information before being allowed to pass by the magical guards. This was Zhao Xu's first time undergoing a close-range inspection by the magical guards.

After passing the inspection, Zhao Xu still looked puzzled, looking back at the stern-faced magical guards.

"Don't be curious," An Xinyue said. "You'll become one of them too someday."

"What? You too?" Zhao Xu asked, surprised.

"You said it," An Xinyue replied.

Before Zhao Xu could ask more questions, the alchemy elevator had already reached the bottom.

Zhao Xu looked at the pair of golden gates slowly opening and then stepped out, feeling luxurious. The two then walked along a narrow, dark corridor covered in dim magical light, with no installations of the common, eternal torches found in the Floating City.

After Zhao Xu became a 3rd-level mage, he mastered the 2nd-level spell, Eternal Torch.
Here is the translation of the text:

You only need to sprinkle 50GP worth of red gemstone powder on the corresponding object, then cast the "Unquenchable Blaze" spell on it. After that, the object will be able to ignite an eternal flame that does not produce heat, and it will not extinguish even without oxygen. Therefore, the Floating City is the most lacking in such illumination items.

This is also the first time Zhao Xu has seen the dark and humid corridors of the Floating City, with green moss growing on the corners of the walls, like a cluster of green glow.

"This path is not suitable for open flames," Anzhenya explained. "Otherwise, it will attract special attacks."

"It's not because of the Morlin Stone," Zhao Xu recalled the connection between the Morlin Stone and the Fire Elemental plane. "The Morlin Stone has already been cleared of all abnormal powers. It's just that the bottom of this corridor is sealed off."

Listening to Anzhenya's words, Zhao Xu couldn't help but admire the boldness of the Master's Guild.

It seems that all sorts of dangerous things have to be sealed off within one's own eyes.

Just like the final scroll, which was sealed away at the bottom of the Pyramid.

Even Zhao Xu thought of going, Anzhenya could only take him through the back door because the regular entrance procedure and rituals were too complicated.

"Master, what's the point of coming to see the stone this time?" Zhao Xu finally asked.

Before, he was kicked back to the ancient era of darkness by Anzhenya, and then he wandered around and came back, with Anzhenya being extremely mysterious and not saying much to him.

Now that they are almost at the location where the Morlin Stone is hidden, Zhao Xu can't help but ask with his inner curiosity.

"Let the Master explain it to you when you get there," Anzhenya simply said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Finally, the two of them walked for almost ten minutes before reaching the corridor, and during the entire process, An Niya rarely used her magic.

"Proof," she saw two heavily armored guards, their entire bodies covered in dark armor, blocking their way.

Zhao Xu didn't think he had reached this point, and there was still a check. Moreover, he had never seen someone wearing full-body armor like this before in the floating city.

The magic user, who was wearing a thick, imposing helmet, took out a piece of paper with a thin gold filigree from his sleeve and handed it to them.

After carefully examining the proof document, the magic user nodded and let them pass.

"That magic user's hand looks a bit unhealthy," Zhao Xu whispered.

"Mages like that who are not dead can show you a withered hand like that," An Niya said.

Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise.

A mage!

Mages, as the most powerful spellcasters in the world of magic, are known for their incredible magical abilities. As long as their magical artifacts are not destroyed, they can revive themselves in a short period of time after being killed.

As such, mages are often the final bosses in heroic fantasy novels.

However, it's rare for mages to be evil.

An Niya seemed to have guessed Zhao Xu's thoughts and explained, "Although there are good mages in the group of mages, the one you just saw is actually an evil mage who has lost and is now guarding the floating city for 100 years."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly realized, it's no wonder that the guards he had met earlier, despite their stern expressions, had shown respect to An Ti Nuo Ya when they met. But when they arrived at this point, it was cold and distant, and it turned out that the witch was not someone who cared about human feelings.

As Zhao Xu thought about this, he couldn't help but look forward to the Morlin Stone Monument ahead.

It was impossible to imagine that it would be ordinary. Then, Zhao Xu followed An Ti Nuo Ya into a hemispherical hall, where more than ten people stood in each corner of the room, looking up at the two of them for a moment before returning to their own tasks.

The Morlin Stone Monument that Zhao Xu had seen in the Dark Era was still standing in the middle of the hall, but it was still impossible to see any markings on it.

Wasn't there something written on it, as An Ti Nuo Ya had said?

In front of the monument, there was a stone bench three meters away, made of the same material as the monument.

Was he supposed to sit down there?

At this moment, the chief wizard of the hall came forward, bowed slightly to An Ti Nuo Ya, and said, "It's been a long time, Miss An."

An Ti Nuo Ya waved her hand slightly and pointed to Zhao Xu, saying, "He's here to test, explain it to him too."

The wizard, Hil, looked at Zhao Xu and smiled, revealing his white teeth. "Let me introduce myself, I'm the person in charge of the Morlin Stone Monument Awakening Ceremony."

"What's an Awakening Ceremony?" Zhao Xu asked.

Hil quickly realized that An Ti Nuo Ya hadn't explained much to Zhao Xu, so he smiled and said, "It's an Advancement Profession Awakening Ceremony."

"But I'm not level 5," Zhao Xu said with a hint of doubt.

Although he liked advancing his profession, it seemed impossible for a wizard of level 5 to obtain a specialization.
Here is the translation:

"Don't worry, Mr. Zhongxia, it's true that the core seed of Floating City will only be arranged for the awakening ceremony after reaching level 5. This ensures a probability of over 70% for them to awaken and advance. However, there are some core seeds, like yours, that may receive special treatment. For instance, you might be able to stay outside for a long time and, once you reach the level limit, easily promote to your original profession, bypassing the opportunity to advance to a new profession.

"So, Floating City also allows you to obtain the content of the new profession in advance. This way, even when you're traveling outside, you can smoothly promote to the new profession."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu finally understood.

It turned out that this awakening ceremony was not something anyone could have.

"How do I awaken?" Zhao Xu asked.

The mage, Hil, slightly lowered her head and looked at Zhao Xu. "It's quite simple. Just sit on that stone bench, and we'll start the ceremony, release the energy, and let you communicate with the Morlin Stone. Then, the stone will absorb your consciousness, and you'll feel like you're in a certain space, undergoing a test. Based on the test results, the stone will assign you a suitable advancement."

Zhao Xu listened, and though he didn't think it was too complicated, he nodded slightly.

Suddenly, Anzhenya directly used her "Mind Link" to communicate with his inner thoughts.

Zhao Xu didn't understand why Anzhenya didn't say anything at the beginning but had to use a spell quietly here. However, he still quickly accepted the other party's connection request.

"Wait, what if the stone is difficult for you? Just recount what you've seen when you traveled through time and tell it to the stone," Anzhenya said calmly.

Zhao Xu was taken aback for a moment.

Recite what I've seen to the stone?
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmm, this monument has been boasting about the magic inscribed on it when it was born, and later Ernest met him and became the strongest mage by relying on the content of the monument."

Zhao Xu immediately reacted: "No way, isn't it now blank?"

"It seems that Ernest didn't want anyone to see the monument become as powerful as him, so he deliberately erased the content of the monument."

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, thinking that the monument was indeed too arrogant, treating itself as the ultimate monument.

"If you saw it in the ancient dark era, then when it was difficult for you to progress, it would have said this to mock it, and naturally it wouldn't dare to be difficult for you again."

"The monument has a 70% awakening rate, because only 70% of it can barely see it. Even if you're within the 70%, you'll be played by the opponent's evil tricks and suffer greatly."

"So, in the floating city, many mages who relied on the monument to progress have a shadow over it."

Zhao Xu finally realized why Annyon was going around in circles, making him travel back in time to see the Millstone Monument before Ernest met him.

It turned out that he wanted him to establish an unbreakable "friendship" with the monument.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu smiled, slowly walking towards the monument and sitting on the same material stone bench in front of it. It was hilarious that one person and the monument met for the first time after at least a million years.

"Start," the mage Hill said at this time.

Instantly, the seven mages directly occupied the seven core positions of the law array, connecting the central axis of the ritual law array.

As the trigger, they each offered their own magical positions as fuel for the law array.

【Summer of Adventurer, starting to connect "Millstone Monument" core】
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In Zhao Xū's eyes, a fleeting flash of countless lights passed, and the entire land began to peel away, with the surrounding space constantly twisting and deforming, gradually becoming increasingly bizarre and eerie.

Finally, darkness descended, engulfing everything.

Just then, Zhao Xū felt that time was stretching out endlessly and was about to close in on him, when a light from the sky fell straight down from the dome, warming his entire body.

"A revered elder brother, what profession do you want to advance to?" a flattering and obsequious voice echoed from thin air.

It seems that the plot is a bit off?
