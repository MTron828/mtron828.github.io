Chapter 363: Auction

The old witch was wearing tattered clothing, with no armor on her body. However, her rugged skin and the powerful damage reduction ability made her fearless in the face of ordinary attacks. The damage reduction ability targeted each attack, allowing her to absorb some of the damage.

Once a monster possesses this terrifying ability, it means that the opponent will no longer fear low-level attacks. Generally speaking, only a few monsters have damage reduction abilities without weaknesses. Otherwise, most will have special flaws. As long as you use corresponding materials to create weapons, you can overcome them.

For example, the old witch's damage reduction ability can be overcome with cold iron or magic weapons. Magic weapons are also the weakness of most damage reduction abilities. However, most ordinary people cannot afford such magic weapons. Only those with special materials such as "fine gold", "secret silver", and "cold iron" can create such weapons. Therefore, unless you're specifically targeting, you'll have to rely on brute force.

This is also the reason why many players in Earth's online games will fail to use the "human wave" tactic against the old witch. The old witch may only appear to be a 11th-level monster, but in reality, she poses a significant threat even to the best players.

In an instant, the old witch had approached the crowd, her purple-black skin covered in pus-filled sores, emitting a pungent stench. This aura was so intimidating that even many heavily armored knights, who had been standing at the back of the crowd, took a few steps back, unable to bear it.
Here is the translation of the text:

When someone shouts the name "Old Witch", many people's hearts are already broken. In the terrifying legend of Arthur, the Old Witch is always famous, not unlike the undead or demonic creatures. They can transform into a spiritual entity and invade a person's dreams, spending the entire night riding on the victim's back, causing endless torment. Even after waking up at dawn, the victim will discover that their physical condition has decreased by one point.

Only Zhao Xu remains calm and composed, like chopping wood for the hundredth time, facing the Old Witch with a firm will. The staff itself is made of hard material and is a valuable magical item worth 170,000 yuan. However, it is not a magic weapon and cannot pierce the Old Witch's damage reduction.

Unless various abilities are stacked together, it is possible that no wound can be caused. However, the Old Witch considers this to be nothing. Watching Zhao Xu's swing, he has the confidence to take on this blow from the pastor.

As for the opponent's spellcaster, it is unknown whether they can withstand the bite attack with disease. Zhao Xu has already reached level 6, but as a mage and a scholar, his attack level is not high, and he may not even be able to compare to a level 3 warrior. However, even if a pig were placed here, its fist, with various secret abilities and magical reinforcement, would not be inferior to a level 10 warrior's fist.

"Dark Knowledge" - 3rd level!
"Knowledge Devotion" - 2nd level!
"Praise" - 3rd level!
Combining the three, Zhao Xu's attack is like a blessing to the heart, with a trajectory and momentum that is extremely cunning.
Here is the translation of the text:

The aura of intimidation emanating from it had already made the old hag feel a sense of impending doom as she approached. However, the old hag still believed in its natural defense abilities, which were equivalent to a +4 entire-body armor, and was confident that it could withstand the assault.

It wasn't until Zhao Xiu's staff touched the old hag's skin that the old hag finally turned pale.

The staff tip burst forth with a shadowy image filled with death intent, and a phantom image appeared, fluttering and fluttering. It seemed like a giant bat with sharp fangs, swooping down to bite.

This scene finally made the old hag realize that this mage was not going to hit it with his staff, but was going to cast a spell on it! The mage's close-range combat spell, which took into account the possibility of hitting, required the mage to weigh the risks of getting close and the ability to hit.

Therefore, mages rarely prepared close-range combat spells. However, they had a significant advantage - they could ignore any armor or natural defense.

The moment of contact meant that the spell had been completed. Spells like "Electric Claw" could transmit the electric current directly to the armor, making it ineffective regardless of the armor's defensive capabilities.

Moreover, the spell's damage was not affected by damage reduction.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you cast the "Vampire's Touch" spell on the old hag, dealing 20 HP (6D6) damage and gaining 20 HP of temporary life, lasting for 1 hour.】
【Adventurer Zhongxia, your life value increases from 30 HP to 50 HP.】
Vampire's Touch.
A spell that can deal damage while also granting an amount of life equal to the damage dealt. It is also a rare spell among mages that can increase life beyond the fake life limit.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

In an instant, Zhao Xu relied on this technique to reduce the old witch's damage from 70 HP to 50 HP, and his own life force approached that of his opponent. His life force suddenly surged to the front of the player list, even surpassing that of a 4th-level barbarian not using the Berserker spell. In this instant, Zhao Xu's attack, life force, and defensive armor all exploded in three dimensions, directly surpassing the vast majority of warriors and barbarian players. Under the premise that most of his abilities are always available, Zhao Xu had already become a powerful warrior capable of standing at the forefront and resisting.

"Ah——"

Just as Zhao Xu grasped his scepter and was about to strike, he discovered that the old witch let out a shrill cry and her body began to blur, slowly transforming into a spectral form. She gradually seeped into the spiritual realm.

As Zhao Xu and others escaped to another plane, he shook his head in dismay.

Unfortunately, he didn't have the four-ring "Dimension Anchor" or the eight-ring "Dimension Lock" to counter this escape behavior. Originally, the mages' tactics of opening a portal and fleeing were no match for Zhao Xu, the mage. Now, this escape tactic was being played out before him, leaving him with a mix of laughter and tears.

"Team leader?" Zheng Xin nodded, staring at the old witch with a mixture of shock and fear. The ferocity of the attack just moments ago was like a storm about to break.

However, in the blink of an eye, the opponent was defeated and fled, vanishing into nothingness.

Zhao Xu was helpless, with no courage to fight back. His only consolation was that he didn't have to pretend to be a child crying. But the sounds of people falling behind him grew louder.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Looking back, it was a group of soldiers who had just trembled with fear, having just been intimidated by the monster Granny Witch, and had only managed to muster the courage to attack their opponent.

After Granny Witch fled, the breath of fear that had been building up finally dissipated.

"We actually managed to chase away a powerful 'Granny Witch'," said Warrior Chuck, wiping the sweat from his forehead and gasping for air.

He knew that today's scene would likely be written into his own biography, if he had descendants who were prepared.

"It seems that there are many stories about Granny Witch around here," said Zhao Xu, looking at the soldiers who were somewhat exhausted. He was clear that this was probably due to some historical reason.

"What happened to Granny Witch?" Elliot asked, taking a deep breath.

It was not that Granny Witch was scared off by these soldiers standing behind her.

This meant that the captain, with his single-minded determination, had already surpassed the strength of a powerful Granny Witch.

"Granny Witch used the 'Soul Travel' spell to escape," explained Zhao Xu.

Granny Witch, who had been hit by him for a full 20 HP, had somehow been able to abandon everything and make a quick decision to flee.

Zhao Xu thought about it for a moment before starting to understand this cunning monster, who was hard to believe could have lived near Mistral.

"'Soul Travel'? Now, Mrs. Betty couldn't help but ask, her voice laced with some hesitation, as if filled with uncertainty.

"No, it's true," Zhao Xu confirmed.

Before coming, he had already prepared enough for the possibility of encountering Granny Witch, including reviewing all the relevant information about Granny Witch.

As for his own knowledge, it went without saying that the abilities of Granny Witch were clearly recorded in black and white.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but find it hard to believe at first.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's wrong, Madam?" Chuck noticed Betty's face changed several times and suddenly realized that there was a hidden agenda.

He had never heard of such a mystical law, let alone a powerful five-ring law.

But Betty, after suppressing her emotions, slowly said, "I thought the old witch's reputation was already well-known, but it seems we underestimated the opponent's abilities."

Her face was half-concerned and half-jovial.

Even with Zheng Xin'an's entire body shining with armor, the flash of white daylight still pierced through, and her gaze was fixed on Zhao Xiu, filled with hope.

"How?" another old guard asked.

Betty's lips were slightly pursed, "That's the nine-ring law."

Like a thunderbolt, it struck the hearts of countless people.

Those who were eating at the cafeteria in Mistral understood the significance of the nine-ring law, so even if a monster could get involved, it would be insignificant.

If they knew that the old witch had the nine-ring law, most knights would probably start fleeing with their weapons.

"Search the area and leave," Zhao Xiu instructed.

His voice was not loud, but it was like a hammer striking the hearts of everyone.

Even without the order of the commander, Chuck, or Betty, or even the already fallen knights, they all stood up and started searching for clues around the room.

Because everyone was clear about what it meant.

The fact that the summer pastor, who could chase away the old witch with the nine-ring law, meant something.

In the following search process, even Zhao Xiu joined the search group and used some magical techniques.
Here is the translation of the text:

They continued to achieve nothing as a group.

It was as if the burned-down house was just a temporary stopping point for the old witch.

Or, to put it another way, the secrets of the house itself had long been buried by the previous fire.

After that, everyone returned to the carriage and set off again, still full of enthusiasm and discussing their encounter with the old witch.

No one would have thought that the group of average-level cavalrymen could escape unscathed from the enemy's grasp, let alone defeat them.

Especially those who had successfully shot the old witch, who felt a sense of pride and were eager to go to the town tavern to brag about it, with smiles on their faces.

In the end, they successfully arrived at the town of Frost and Snow, and were treated to a warm welcome by Betty's mother.

During their stay, Zhao Xiu also briefly explored the rustic customs of the town under Betty's guidance, while Zheng Xin allowed himself to be indulgent at the stalls and picked up a few small trinkets.

As the sun set and the stone carvings on the hillside took on a golden hue, accompanied by the gentle sound of the stream, Zhao Xiu looked at the invitation to the auction, his heart heavy with silence, and it was now tonight.
