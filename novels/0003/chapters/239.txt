Chapter 240: The First Player

These players who were ambushed were already in a state of disarray, and when they saw Zhao Xu, who looked like a god, their minds were even more shaken.

Everyone fell into a state of silence.

It wasn't until a while later that a mage in the scene stood up and asked Zhao Xu, "Are you a player?"

As soon as he finished speaking, he himself felt like laughing and cursed himself for playing too many games.

Based on his estimation, this powerful warrior in a mage's robe was probably just a high-level warrior with a short-range teleportation ability.

It was impossible for a mage who didn't have a spellcasting ability to have such physical output.

If that were the case, even the other ten basic occupations would change into mages.

Even if he was a mage, he wouldn't have such a dull fantasy.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly opened his mouth and said, "Not wrong."

This sentence was not in the common language of the game, but in ordinary language.

Like a thunderbolt that broke the quiet night, all the players in the scene were shocked by Zhao Xu's words.

"It's impossible."
"How is that possible?"
The waves of doubts rose and fell.

Only Zhao Xu's ordinary words had such convincing power that it made everyone doubt themselves and unable to refute.

"It's the four-star mage!" One player suddenly reacted.

This guess directly entered the hearts of all players without needing a second thought.

Only the four-star divine being who had jumped from level 1 to level 4 and looked down on all level 2 and 1 players could have such a terrifying aura in front of him.
Here's the translation of the text:

Just then, the mage player suddenly thought of many details. Was it really that powerful at level 4?

It's easy and efficient to take down more than 60 level 1-2 warriors, and the opponent's sword looks like a divine artifact. "What's your name, Great God?" a player standing a little far away asked, looking at the leading mage with a curious expression.

"Starlight Reflection," Zhao Xun suddenly replied, reporting his alternate ID.

"Mr. Reflection, are you the 4th-level mage?" the mage player asked, with a hopeful expression.

"No mistake," Zhao Xun replied.

After hearing this, the players in the scene couldn't help but feel a sense of witnessing history. Some even wanted to quit the game and wait for the 1-minute cooling-off period, but they were afraid of missing the first player's secrets.

"How did you do it? It's obviously a warrior's specialty!" a rough-voiced man in the corner asked, possibly a warrior player.

"Mages can do things that are always beyond people's imagination," Zhao Xun thought for a moment before casting the first blessing spell.

When Zhao Xun assumed the mage's first blessing spell was the warrior's exclusive skill just used, the entire group of players was shocked. Perhaps they had underestimated the power of mages.

In reality, Zhao Xun wasn't lying. The preconditions for "Sweeping Slash" are "Fierce Attack".
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu used the ring magic "Soul Attachment" and gained a warrior's specialization for the next 400 minutes, which is approximately seven hours. This is one of the few spells that can grant a specialization to oneself.

As for the subsequent "Sweeping Cut" and "Great Sweeping Cut", they were simulated by Zhao Xu using his latent potential.

"Aren't we possible to become as strong as you?" a player asked finally.

"Yes, we can," Zhao Xu said quietly, looking towards the distant horizon where the sun was setting.

Then, Zhao Xu's figure disappeared into thin air.

The remaining players were shocked by his teleportation spell...

At night, Zhao Xu was alone, roasting marshmallows by the campfire, waiting for the night to deepen.

The campfire in front of him kept crackling and popping, and the tree branches were slowly carbonizing and burning under the high temperature.

The firelight illuminated Zhao Xu's face, making his face look somewhat pale and unclear.

Zhao Xu told some inside information to the players around sunset.

By around 7-8 pm, the entire forum had been completely blown up.

Some non-winter city players started to investigate the origins of "Star Lake".

At least, it was unlikely to be ordinary after Zhao Xu's "Star Shadow" attention.

As for why Zhao Xu did this.

On one hand, he also needed to set up a real target for players to promote the power of mages.

At least, after seeing his close-range combat skills as a mage that far exceeded the killing power of warriors today.

It would affect many people's views on the initial combat power of mages, and completely quash the doubts on the combat power of a level 4 mage on the forum.
Here is the translation of the text:

Reducing the noise on the forum, he suddenly appeared, claiming to be a level 4 player. Typically, such posts are filled with various excuses, explaining why verification cannot be done, such as on a mysterious island.

Moreover, he participated in the player group's battle for the next few days with less mouth-watering. By the next day, everyone would know he's here.

On the other hand, there is Zhao Xu's concept of the Grim Reaper's persona.

From the underground temple, altar, artificial Grim Reaper, demonic beast, and giant scythe... all these information seem to imply that the Grim Reaper has not died so easily.

So Zhao Xu solidified his image and spread it through the players' mouths, becoming a subtle pawn. He may even release more clues in the coming days.

However, Zhao Xu is not conceding, and he is still in the game, preparing for tonight's infiltration.

The vast wealth stored by the former mine owners has actually been plundered by the players who broke through the camp for the first time.

It was also due to this gain that the players in Winter City slowly rose to power.

Without this, the former alliance would not have made a big splash, and they would not have been able to make a sound in the future.

Zhao Xu's goal, however, is the exploration and survey data of the Star Lake hidden by the mine owners.

At the time when he visited Star Lake in the past, these data had already been stolen.

Now that he thinks back, he was slow to react at the time.

Zhao Xu has also re-examined his state, despite just finishing a battle and needing to adjust his strategy.

At this moment, the most powerful spell on Zhao Xu's body is the "Nine-Ring 'Choose Fate'".

Luckily, he was able to summon the Fiery God's Servant this time, and the other side also believes in the Magic Goddess.
Here is the translation of the text:

So he had the corresponding "fate" field, which enabled him to display this pure domain magic.

After completing the magic, Zhao Xu could get enlightenment in four aspects: attack, skill, attribute, and saving throw, and could choose a better option to execute.

In the mysterious space, Zhao Xu had once used a lower-level magic to pray for a 75% chance of mental saving throw, but it only had one-time effect.

Unlike now, he has been feeling this advantage all the time.

Therefore, when Zhao Xu waved his giant scythe today, the critical hit probability was this high.

Originally, his critical hit probability was 5%, but it directly increased to around 10%.

In fact, even if he could not trigger a "heavy blow" with a 20-level attack, it would not necessarily trigger a critical hit.

Only by activating the "heavy blow" threat again could he smoothly trigger a critical hit.

Before the battle, Zhao Xu intentionally applied a "Lament of Sorrow" magic to his weapon.

This three-ring divine magic had a duration of one minute, but it increased the range of the heavy blow, so even if Zhao Xu's attack level was 19, he could still trigger the heavy blow threat.

Moreover, under the influence of this magic, the heavy blow threat would inevitably confirm the critical hit.

Therefore, with the combination of "Destiny Selection" and "Lament of Sorrow", Zhao Xu's critical hit probability approached 19%.

This means that as long as he swings his sword five times, he can basically guarantee a headshot.

However, Zhao Xu's original plan was to inevitably trigger a critical hit.

Naturally, he had his own confidence.

Zhao Xu's current five-ring magic includes a spell called "Tidal Wave of Good Fortune".
Here is the translation of the text:

This magical technique has an impact on King Arthur's ecosystem - determining fate, it will undoubtedly unleash the "20th tier" effect.

During the duration of the spell, his basic attacks, evasions, and skills can all be boosted by 2 levels of luck.

However, once the ultimate effect is triggered, all luck will suddenly burst forth, and the spell's effects will terminate.

At that moment, he will become the son of destiny.

Regardless of whether he attacks, uses skills, or casts spells to penetrate enemy defensive magic, he will always unleash perfect "20th tier" effects in that instant.

It means that with this magical technique, King Arthur will be unstoppable, ready to strike anyone down with absolute certainty.

Later on, he will continue to fight in the same way, repeatedly following this pattern.

Ordinary people would evaluate the situation based on probability distribution.
However, the caster wants 100% certainty.

This magical technique is also what King Arthur prepared for his tonight's infiltration.

There, he needs to pay attention to the existence waiting for him.
