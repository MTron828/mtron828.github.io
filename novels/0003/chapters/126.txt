Chapter 127: All First-Rank Spells

Zhao Xu stood silently in front of the countless spellbooks, gazing into the distance. According to An Ti Noya, they had entered through the back door this time.

The completely sealed room was actually a projection of the "Final Scroll" and was hidden behind a wall in the pagoda. Only those who had previously taken turns guarding the scroll would know when and where the true projection of the back door would appear.

Only by entering through the back door could one avoid the complex procedures and inspections. As a 2nd-level novice like Zhao Xu, he didn't even have the qualification to know.

Zhao Xu even speculated that An Ti Noya had mentioned that the scroll was stored at the bottom of the pagoda, and the term "bottom" could be questioned.

"If outsiders knew about this place, they would probably protest against the game," Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

Even if external scholars of the ancient arts saw this scene, they would be envious to the point of bleeding.

The divine magic granted by the gods is different from the magic researched or copied by scholars of the ancient arts.

This is why "copying the scroll" is a professional skill of scholars of the ancient arts.

The same spell, such as detection magic, has different versions of arcane and divine magic. Therefore, scholars of the ancient arts can only painstakingly seek out the divine version to learn.

Compared to the numerous arcane scrolls and spellbooks,
Here is the translation of the text:

The magical tome is extremely rare on the market because clergymen lack the ability to "copy" tomes, and they must spend a significant amount of spiritual energy to learn. The number of clergymen who can naturally copy tomes is far fewer than that of wizards who can do so.

As for magical spellbooks, it's even more ridiculous. Only scholars of ancient texts need such a thing, and they also refer to it as a prayer book, which is the source of their joy and suffering.

Compared to wizards, who can at least borrow and copy magical spellbooks by paying others, scholars of ancient texts have always been struggling to afford rare magical tomes. Alternatively, they can pursue research and deciphering, searching for hidden clues in various religious scriptures, sacred books, and ancient stone inscriptions to learn the desired magic.

The scarcity of scholars of ancient texts makes it difficult for them to find a peer, let alone copy a prayer book, and there is also the risk of losing magical abilities.

Only those who can reach the depths of the "Ultimate Tome" can freely obtain magical abilities like Zhao Xu.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu has finally understood.

Why does Anziniya say that scholars of ancient texts can learn all forms of magic and all magical arts?

This refers to the fact that all magical arts have corresponding versions, and it is through this loophole that scholars of ancient texts can become all-around spellcasters.

"Magic Shield," Zhao Xu whispered softly.

Just then, a golden-edged magical dictionary flew down from above and landed in front of Zhao Xu.

The dictionary automatically opened, revealing its contents to Zhao Xu.

As if an invisible hand was flipping through the pages, the magical dictionary revealed its contents before Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

Adventurer Zhongxu succeeded in copying the divine magic "Mage's Shield" through "Wisdom Granting" and refreshed the dynamic panel immediately.

Although this divine magic "Mage's Shield" is similar to the arcane version, Zhao Xu didn't expect that he would automatically master it just by browsing through it quickly.

Compared to other scroll learners, Zhao Xu's speed is too fast, and he didn't even need to spend a day to understand the magic. Moreover, he noticed that he didn't apply "Reading Magic" or identify the magic, and yet he still learned the magic automatically.

In the world of magic, learning magic always carries a certain failure rate. If failure occurs, it will cause confusion, and one can only wait for the magic identification ability to improve before attempting to learn again.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that this must be due to the effects of the scroll space. He didn't know how long he could stay here and hastily summoned another magic book.

The level 1 divine magic "Precise Blessing" book fell open in front of Zhao Xu automatically, and the pages turned rapidly.

In just over ten seconds, Zhao Xu had a rough look and was about to delve into it more thoroughly.

Suddenly, his dynamic information popped up again:

"Adventurer Zhongxu succeeded in copying the divine magic 'Precise Blessing' through 'Wisdom Granting'."

This time, Zhao Xu felt a bit uneasy.

He looked up, gazing at the countless tomes of magic books that stretched out before him.

"Precise Blessing" is a level 1 divine magic suitable for mages and holy warriors, which can increase the remote hit rate of teammates by about 10%. This magic is not one of the core divine magic granted by the gods, which is also the reason Zhao Xu chose it deliberately.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because he had never touched this magical technique before, he was completely unfamiliar with it!
Core magical techniques are mostly those that are widely spread and most common.
Magical techniques outside the core are generally only explored by clerics or those with special experiences, and only then if the gods grant them.
Since the scroll space has recorded all forms of magic, Zhao Xu no longer needs to pray for magic every time, relying on chance.
He can only learn what he's learned and use it.
Thinking about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh deeply.
He actually wanted to study magic properly, but the organization didn't give him the opportunity.
In this scroll space, he could even skip the various stimulation methods needed to record magic, just like copying various magic scrolls at high speed, without having to pay the printing fee.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu closed his eyes and noticed the differences in the magical technique list, and then summoned another magical book to appear before him.
At this moment, the first-level divine magic "Secondary Energy Shield" of the Saint Warrior was in front of his eyes.
The process of recording magic in his mind remained smooth as ever.
This time's recording also confirmed Zhao Xu's understanding of something.
Scholars of the scroll can exploit loopholes in magical technique levels.
Even Anniya didn't dare to brag about this point.
"The Secondary Energy Shield" is a magic that can absorb 5 points of elemental damage per round. If he had mastered this magic at the beginning, he could have reduced the damage from the Druid's lightning strike and had some room to maneuver.
However, "Secondary Energy Shield" is a second-level divine magic for clerics.
But it is also a first-level divine magic for Saint Warriors.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu relied on the "Secondary Energy Shield" to successfully learn a level 2 spell that was originally only accessible to third-level priests in the Saint Warrior's list of level 1 divine magic. Saint Warriors, Ranger, and other professions all obtain divine magic later in the game, and their own divine magic does not reach level 9, making their conditions lower.

The next day, Zhao Xu compared the lists of various professions and continuously extracted the spells he wanted from the vast library of magic books, learning them one by one.

Until he couldn't even remember the names of the spells.

He officially became one of the few "Casters" who mastered most of the level 1 spells.

...After logging off, Zhao Xu found it difficult to shake off the excitement of easily learning spells.

He lay on his bed, his whole body flushed with excitement.

Even his pulse became faster, and it was possible that the protective helmet would activate, forcing him to disconnect.

This would cause Zhao Xu's character to remain in the game, falling into a coma.

It wasn't until 20 minutes had passed that he could log back in and regain control.

Although he knew this, Zhao Xu's mind and body were unable to suppress the thrill.

He was almost master of all level 1 spells!

"Cast with Wisdom" combined with the "Final Scroll" made it so that whenever he learned a spell, he would turn into a traditional online game.

" Ding" - and he would obtain it.

This gave Zhao Xu, who had a tendency to collect things, a sense of spiritual fulfillment.

Whether or not it was useful, he had learned it.

As long as there was no warning from Anis, who told him to prepare useful spells and not waste time on useless ones, he had learned it, and that was enough.

For ordinary mages, one day of learning one spell, and over 300 spells in a year, were barely enough to keep up with Zhao Xu's progress in one day.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not worth mentioning the tens of thousands of gold coins spent on copying and borrowing fees, let alone the cost of copying and borrowing.

Money is of little concern to Zhao Xu right now. The main thing is to learn magic, which has saved him a lot of time.

Even the top-level magic practitioners from the Arthurian family, who are the crème de la crème of magic practitioners, have fewer than half as many first-level spells as Zhao Xu.

The first-level spells that exist are hard to learn, and it's even harder to find a way to learn them.

Not to mention magic books, which are unlikely to be familiar with the names of these spells.

It's no wonder that Anniya initially didn't bother giving him those first-level spell scrolls.

In the end, he had to use the time he spent traveling to learn by copying and recording.

Because his opponent had already made plans to let him enter the final scroll.

After taking a deep breath, Zhao Xu removed his VR headset and jumped off the bed.

It's around 8-9 PM now, and the dormitory is empty. There's a class basketball game at the gym tonight, and basically everyone has gone to participate.

Zhao Xu had wanted to order takeout, but saw a message from Zhang Qi reminding him to check in after logging off tonight's life-and-death battle.

Zhao Xu shook his head and smiled, but still couldn't resist getting up to prepare to go.

It's not good to be away from the group for too long.

Although there were conflicts and conflicts in the past class, after crossing over, everyone was able to unite and strive for greater benefits due to their professional levels and resources.

Zhao Xu was also backed by his class and was able to take over as the chief of the town's security, similar to the head of the county's public security department.

As Zhao Xu walked down the stairs, he opened his phone and browsed through the hot threads on the forum today.
Here is the translation:

"It's troublesome to say that Master Stra floated the air city, can't provide evidence, don't just blow something about 22-minute mastery of scroll recording ability!"

"Blowing hot air is possible, but broke the record of magician training time, can you blow again?"

Zhao Xu looked a bit strange.

In the previous life, half a year ago, Master Stra was not a hot topic in the forum. Those Master Stra magicians were struggling quietly.

It wasn't until he entered the game in the 8th month that there was a slight heat.

Even after crossing over, not many people were clear about which high-level magicians in the player group were from Master Stra.
Why are there consecutive hot posts, all criticizing something?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but become curious, and directly opened the forum details to watch.

Note: Master Stra is likely a fictional character or a guild in the game, and the context seems to be about a game or an online community.
