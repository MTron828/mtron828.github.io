Chapter 24: Zero-level Magic
"Did I succeed?"
Despite having confirmed the result, Zhao Xuan couldn't help but mutter to himself.

"Halfway, maybe."
"Halfway?" Zhao Xuan almost didn't react, was the ritual still halfway through?

"It's probably because you're all projections. To actually complete it, I estimate it will take a chance for physicalization in the future. That's when you'll truly gain this ability. For now, it doesn't matter, it's enough for you to remember the magic formula."

Zhao Xuan finally relaxed, regarding the other's mention of physicalization.

It's probably referring to the event where everyone will be transported to Arthur in a year.

Zhao Xuan had always been skeptical in his past life, and many Earth humans believed that this game was just a preliminary screening.
If 6-7 billion people suddenly appeared on Earth, despite the vastness of the main material plane, it would be difficult to handle the sudden influx of people.

So, these players who have interacted with Arthur are the pioneers.

As for how to make TC develop this game, one is that the game content is all AI-defined.
Two is that there are many manipulation spells in the occult that can control people's minds, which is not a problem.
Some people even suspect that a god has taken on a physical form in the past year.
However, all of this has no relevance to Zhao Xuan. Even if he knew who the god's physical form was, he wouldn't do something reckless like trying to make contact.
He just needs to wait patiently.
But it's unknown whether the super meteor that fell to Earth and destroyed humanity was due to coincidence or intentional arrangement, and it won't be clear until ten years later.

The game's top-ranked mage finally emerged after a seven-day period from Monday evening to the following Monday. Despite the fact that many players had been complaining about the complexity of mage training through posts on the forum, the actual time it took to complete the training was far beyond the expectations of many players. The limited number of spell slots and the strength of the first-level spells, which were known to those familiar with the game, left many players disappointed.

The data showed that even casual players who had reached level 5 could hold their own against warriors, and those who reached level 10 were far superior. However, players were unable to understand how high-end mages fought due to their environment. As for Zhao Xu, he spent most of his time outside of the forum and maintaining his physical fitness, and also finally cleared the level of basic modeling and various spell poses.

He had also reached the stage of studying zero-level spells. Compared to the top-ranked mage who completed the training, Zhao Xu's progress was not significantly lagging behind. He spent three and a half days studying three first-level spells, each requiring 24 hours of study, excluding 4 hours of deep sleep each day.

It was said that the top-ranked mage had temporarily put aside the training of subsequent skills to focus on setting a new record.

Many people have witnessed that, even if someone is the first to complete their training in a local area, local associations will still give out some rewards. However, there are no special titles or aura-like rewards.

Zhao Xu is still stuck on the zero-level magic and cannot summon demons or record spells. This has made him realize the gap between himself and true born magicians.

These top-level innate abilities allow exceptional players to stand out in the early stages. However, Zhao Xu has not heard from those exceptional players, including the one who was the first to complete the magician's training.

The five revival stones are both a hope and a poison for players. Who among them dares to take the risk?

Lying on the desk, next to the eternal magic lamp, Zhao Xu supported his chin with one hand and read from the "Zero-Level Magic Manual" with the other.

From reading magic to magician's hands, there are a total of 19 zero-level magic spells that all novice magicians should master. Some wild magicians may miss a few.

However, finding a magician's association in a major city makes it easy to record these zero-level magic spells.

Zhao Xu has heard about the "Reading Magic" spell from Ana Noya from the start.

After casting the spell, he can read magical texts without identifying the spell, and the duration is 10 minutes per caster level. Zhao Xu, although not yet officially a 1st-level magician, can still barely qualify as a 1st-level magician, so he can release this spell for exactly 10 minutes.

At a reading speed of one page per minute, it's just enough to read 10 pages.

If the previous model defines the concept, then what he has learned are specific spells that can solve problems. It's not just copying a zero-level spell into a spellbook that takes up only half a page of space. However, each zero-level spell in this "Compendium of Zero-Level Spells" occupies tens of pages, recording various predecessors' experiences, ideas, and potential pitfalls.

Zhao Xu only realized this when he spent 24 hours reading and didn't include the extra materials. If he didn't understand the spell after 24 hours, some wizards would resort to using others' notes or introductions, which are available at the local wizarding association's library.

The book in Zhao Xu's hands is such a book.

Otherwise, Anzhenoya would only need to provide a 9.5-page spellbook for him.

The mark of a wizard mastering a spell is when he successfully records it in his own spellbook. If he can record it, he can prepare it for the next day.

Therefore, whether Zhao Xu can enter the next level of arcane learning is simple: it depends on when he can record these 19 zero-level spells in his mind.

Zero-level spells are the only ones that don't require Zhao Xu to use such stimulating potions to record them. However, first-level spells differ, requiring three vials of potions worth 50 gold pieces to stimulate the mind during his learning of zero-level spells. Anzhenoya placed these potions on his desk when he was learning zero-level spells.

According to his knowledge, any wizard with a basic understanding of alchemy can make these potions themselves, and the material source will not limit wizards.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Including the materials used for recording magical spells in spellbooks, which are also used for creating magical items, are all of this sort, and even higher-level mages can create them on their own. Besides having guidance from previous masters when learning spells, there are no other limitations for mages themselves, and they can freely create their own specialized items.
