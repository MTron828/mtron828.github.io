Chapter 137: Exposure and Shadow

"Is everything okay?" asked the female mage, Lü, as she scanned her surroundings with concern.

But all she saw was the same quiet and eerie forest with a reddish tint, with no signs of anything unusual.

Meanwhile, the female mage's shadow, Jiè, knelt down and picked up the fishing line that Zhao Xu had tripped over, looking in the direction of the arrow shaft towards a tall, towering beech tree in the distance.

She shook her head and said, "It's just a simple trap. If it's not poisoned or explosive, it won't cause more than 6 HP of damage to a mage like me with a constitution of 14."

Zhao Xu, who had forgotten the subtle pain in his chest, looked at her in surprise and said, "You can tell I have a constitution of 14?"

The female mage, Jiè, smiled and said, "I also know you have only 8 strength. It's easy to guess after observing people with different attributes and establishing a model based on the three attributes."

After observing for a while, the female mage, Lü, confirmed there were no subsequent attacks and followed Jiè in kneeling down to examine Zhao Xu. "It's just a simple bow trap," she said.

She looked at the wound on Zhao Xu's body and said, "I have a medical skill. Let me take a look and make sure there's no poison."

Zhao Xu just shook his head lightly in response to the female mage's good intentions.

After being hit by that arrow, Zhao Xu had finally understood.

This was a warning from Lian, the lightning god.

Everything was no longer as it had been planned from the start.

Although Zhao Xu didn't know why this change had occurred, it meant that he would have to treat everything he saw as a deadly adventure from now on.

"How much damage was it?" the female mage, Lü, asked, holding up the arrow shaft that had injured Zhao Xu.

"6 HP," Zhao Xu replied simply.
After hearing Zhao Xu's answer, the two female wizards, Yin and Lu, remained silent for a moment.

"What do you mean? Do you mean the Shadow Sculpting Technique and the Shadow Spell Technique?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment and finally understood the reason for their silence.

As he thought of this, he couldn't help but take a deep breath.

It's really that troublesome.

Wizards have eight major schools, and some practitioners will choose to specialize in one school and gain a greater advantage in that school. Many players will also choose this route to occupy multiple spell slots. However, this comes at the cost of having to give up one or two schools of magic.

Once someone has chosen to specialize in one school, they will no longer be able to cast spells from other schools. But, wizards can use the Shadow Sculpting Technique and Shadow Spell Technique from the Illusion school to simulate spells from other schools.

However, the authenticity is limited. For example, the simulated Fireball spell will only deal a portion of the actual damage.

This is what authenticity means.

Zhao Xu had just taken a trap arrow and suffered 6 HP of damage, which is the maximum damage.

If this is a dream world, then it's 100% authentic. It's no different from the real world. There's no point in wondering whether it's the 8th layer or whether there's a teleportation.

They are on an adventure.

"Now, I think we need to muster our courage. Even if this is a dream world, we can still die here," Yin said calmly.

Lu looked at Zhao Xu with concern, "Do you still have any Revival Stones?"

Zhao Xu nodded, five of them were full.

However, he had no intention of giving up the task.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since we're all 2nd-level mages, let's reveal our cards and see how we can cooperate," said Lu as she suggested after getting Zhao's response. "Don't need to, everyone can figure it out on their own. As long as you wear a hat and go out, no one will recognize you, and you don't need to ask about the method, that's it," replied the female mage, Shadow.

"That's okay," Lu said with a slight smile after Shadow rejected her suggestion.

"That's fine with me," Zhao said, looking at the scene and thinking it would be difficult to keep secrets.

He stood up and took out the Aine stone he had hidden away earlier, making it float above his head.

He then used his priest spell to cast a "Light Wound Healing" spell on himself.

Immediately, Zhao's overall state improved significantly, and his tolerance for danger increased greatly.

The two women silently watched as Zhao, a mage, used a healing spell that only priests could cast, and they adhered to the agreement, not asking any questions.

Shadow took out an Aine stone similar to Zhao's and released it. After the stone floated around, she pulled out a scroll from her waist and began to chant.

When her incantation was finished, a puff of smoke emerged from the scroll, followed by the disappearance of the arcane script on the scroll.

Slowly, the smoke began to condense into a human shape and then disappeared.

"I've released the 'Homunculus' spell, which can scout ahead for us. Do you have a bag and a shovel?" Shadow asked.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu gazed at the other party's head, where a level +1 magic crystal, Einen, was placed. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly, and he hadn't seen such a scene in his past life. Today, he unexpectedly met his identical twin brother.

Zhao Xu immediately took out the tool required by the other party from his backpack.

In the corner of the mysterious forest, the highest-level mage among the three Arthur players knelt down, holding a shovel and opening a sack, constantly pouring soil into it. It was as if three children playing in the mud.

The invisible servant, a helper of magic, could be summoned to assist in various tasks, even on a scholarly podium. Although they had no form or consciousness after being summoned, only the mage could sense them. However, they could still follow the mage's instructions to repeat simple tasks. From opening doors to serving dishes, they could do it all.

The invisible servant could trigger traps, but its own strength was limited. Therefore, Zhao Xu and the others directly dug a bag of 80-90 kg of soil, letting the invisible servant drag it.

In this way, even if there were traps ahead, such as pitfalls or recently triggered traps, the invisible servant could lead the way.

When the invisible servant was carrying a bag of soil and moving forward, the three of them finally exhaled slightly, having avoided some simple traps.

Zhao Xu didn't think much, preparing to put on a mage's armor. Just then, the female mage suddenly said, "Wait a minute."

She directly took out a cotton bag from her robe, seemingly pulling out a stack of scrolls from the bag like magic.

The thick stack of scrolls was not much different from the ones Anzhinoja had given him to record magic on his travels.

Zhao Xu immediately realized that the bag was not just a bag, but a spatial item dimensional bag.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Even the cheapest one is 2500 GP, which is more expensive than his backpack.

As he gazed at the scroll in her hand, the female mage, Luo, divided it into three sections and handed them to the two of them, saying softly, "Take these scrolls for now."

The female mage, Yǐ, was taken aback by the number of scrolls Luo had, but she didn't say much and directly reached into her bosom to pull out a small leather pouch. From it, she poured out 25 gold coins.

However, this was just enough to pay for one level-up scroll.

Luo handed over the scroll stack, which was at least over 10 scrolls.

Yǐ was annoyed because she had spent a few hundred gold coins on collecting items yesterday due to her collecting habit. Suddenly, she emptied her storage.

She thought about the items she had brought and, with a pursed mouth, directly handed the paper bag to Luo, saying, "This bag is a security deposit. It's something I found in the Floating City. As long as you put in 1 gold coin before sunset, 25 gold coins will appear the next morning. In 11 days, you'll be able to break even. However, you can't put in more than that."

Zhao Xū, who was watching the scene, scratched his head. His first reaction was to calculate the extra income the bag could bring in a year - 8760 gold coins.

He often strolled around the Floating City, but he had never had such an opportunity.

It seemed that the two female mages in front of him were all under pressure.

Zhao Xū was hesitant, thinking that this must be a scam.

However, he didn't have any valuable items worth a few hundred gold coins.

Anzhen Niyao also thought that Zhao Xū didn't need to spend money, and that his backpack only had a few dozen gold coins left over from his previous adventures.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't think much, and after he took the scroll, he was about to take out an automatic note-taking pen for Luo to pawn.

However, Luo, the female mage, waved her hand and blocked the wallet that was sent by the shadow.

"These are for you. Because most of them are gifts from others, I think they can be more effective in your hands."

"Or maybe, I think this trial is not just about learning a technique, but may have a deeper meaning. I also hope you can become stronger."

The shadow looked at Luo with a strange expression.

Luo, who was known for being overly kind to others, would often give everything she had to those who treated her well, which is why she gave away the hen that laid golden eggs on the spot.

As one of the top three mages in the player group, she would not stoop to doing something unfair.

However, she couldn't help but ask: "Are you saintly to everyone?"

Zhao Xu and the shadow continued to listen silently as Luo spoke.

"So I'm happy to see that you're all the same. If you feel that someone needs help, you can just reach out to them."

At this point, Luo also took out a crystal-like Aern stone from her pocket, released it, and let it float above her head.

Then, Luo pulled out a bag from the dimensional bag and handed seven or eight level one mana recovery pearls to Zhao Xu.

"You can use these to recover your mana position first, but this is not entirely mine, so I won't give it to you."

Note: I've translated the text as accurately as possible, but please keep in mind that the original text is from a Chinese novel, and some cultural references or nuances may be lost in translation.
Zhao Xu saw this scene and almost slapped his forehead, thinking he couldn't believe that Lu Ru, who was not as naive as he thought, would show such an unsuspecting behavior.

Even though he himself didn't have any ulterior motives, he couldn't help but stare at the dimensional bag lying on the ground, wondering what treasures it might contain.

Zhao Xu knew he might have stumbled upon the first rich player among his peers.

It's exactly such a scene that would be hard to believe even if posted on the forum.
