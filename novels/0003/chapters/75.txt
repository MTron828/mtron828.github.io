Chapter 076: Setting Up Camp

After spending about half an hour integrating, the smuggling team finally managed to recover the lost horse-drawn carts. After another hour or two, the skilled followers were able to repair the damaged carts.

Seeing that there were no casualties, Lo Ya was clear that the spell was a warning from the last resort of the druid, Otmar Isdru.

Lo Ya dared not try to take the original forest path again, for the next time he would not face a single, non-lethal lightning strike, but rather a direct area-of-effect spell.

Unlike the densely networked roads on Earth, the ancient forest had far fewer good roads that horse-drawn carts could travel on. Even ordinary people with axes might not be able to walk through the unexplored forest.

After discussing it with the others, Lo Ya had to resort to the backup plan left by the original leader, which was to bypass the forest from the other side of Itor Forest.

Compared to the densely populated forest guarded by the druids in the north, Itor Forest was the biggest problem, with a higher concentration of monsters and a higher risk of being attacked.

This was also a trial for Lo Ya after he took office, and he could only grit his teeth and persevere.

After the smuggling team set off again, they spent a peaceful half-day, and it wasn't until nightfall that they found a spot near a stream to set up camp and build tents.

Zhao Xue and the other players took advantage of the downtime to log off, eat, take a bath, and then quickly log back on.

If the team were to be ambushed and forced to flee during this window of time, it would be very difficult for the few players to survive in the wilderness, even if they were only a day's journey from the city.
Here is the translation:

The passives have been returning to the city, and it has become a common way for many players who are exhausted from fighting. This is also the reason why most new players prefer to stay together in groups and avoid venturing into the wilderness.

As night falls, everyone gathers around the campfire to chat and reminisce about their close call earlier. The three players, including Zhao Xu, are laughing and joking as if everything is just a minor incident.

However, Zhao Xu is sitting quietly on the side, reflecting on his own mistakes from today. The followers of Luo Ya are mostly 1st-level warriors and civilians, with few exceptions. They are not capable of recognizing advanced spells like the 5th-level "Summon Storm" spell, let alone identifying it as an upgraded version of the 3rd-level "Summon Lightning" spell.

Zhao Xu can quickly identify the spell as a 3rd-level spell, "Summon Storm", which deals continuous damage to a single target unless the caster is very close. There are nearly 50 people present, and Zhao Xu's chances of hitting the target are relatively low.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu is looking for a merchant group - the more people, the more targets, and he can use the opportunity to distract the enemy.

At the time, Zhao Xu was completely panicked and put all his hopes in the three cards given to him by Ansilvum. He couldn't help but mutter to himself about his foolishness.

In that situation, his first priority should have been to focus on defeating those treants. If he had equipped himself with a mage's armor and defense level to 14th level, facing the treants with an attack power of 12th level would have been futile.
Here is the translation:

Only when defensive level is above 10 levels higher than attack level, can one reduce the hit rate to below 50%. However, he can put on a level one divine shield spell on himself. If he casts the spell after absorbing the essence of the earthstone and delayed spellcasting, the duration of the spell will reach 4 rounds, and the treants will need to make a spell saving throw to hit him, with a failure rate of nearly one-third. Alternatively, he can cast a level one divine mist spell to suppress the enemy's vision. Although he may become a priority target if he casts a spell, it's a different matter whether he can react in time and make a rational plan. After summarizing the situation, Zhao Xiu also knows that he is a novice mage, and it's understandable that he doesn't have much experience in combat. The difficulty lies in making the right choice in the heat of the moment. Zhao Xiu also realizes that his initial plan was flawed and didn't achieve the desired result, so he can only continue to adjust and improve. Later that night, Lak told them that they would have a fixed rotation for night watch, with a few days before it's their turn. The players then returned to the temporary tent to rest. Zhao Xiu didn't use up any spell slots today, so he doesn't need to rest for 8 hours to recover his spell slots. Moreover, his spell slots won't refresh at a specific moment; if he casts a spell during the night, it will still be counted as part of the next day's spell slots. Therefore, mages dislike ambushes at midnight, but it's the favorite pastime of wild monsters. Although Zhao Xiu doesn't need to sleep, he still quietly reads the books given to him by Anny.
Here is the translation of the text:

A passerby, Rainbow, couldn't help but glance over at Zhao Xu, saying, "I didn't expect your backpack to be flat and still able to hold a lot of things."

Zhao Xu chuckled and replied, "It's all about the visual effect."

The book in Zhao Xu's hand was actually the tutorial on "Sustained Magic" given to him by Anniya, which he had been reading intensively over the past few days. Although he struggled to understand the material each time, he had finally mastered the techniques for preparing magic spells and could now combine them with the "Sustained Magic" effect.

As the last word on the page disappeared, Zhao Xu finished reading the entire tutorial. However, the tutorial did not appear on his character card.

Undeterred, Zhao Xu closed the book and added another drop of blood to the page. The content would reappear. After three attempts, he still didn't understand it, so he might need to ask Anniya for help.

It was almost midnight, and the four players, including three men, were all asleep in their sleeping bags. Meanwhile, the priest, Yu Yu, was still reading her theological texts by candlelight, completely focused, like a student taking a college entrance exam.

As Zhao Xu, who had a sense of responsibility, felt that he should educate his opponents about the game, but now he could only hope that they could withstand the pressure and focus on the game.

People often admire those who strive for their goals.

Zhao Xu sighed and continued to take out the magic scrolls from his backpack, including the first-level spell "Summon Mount".

Before, he had been too busy reading the tutorial to pay attention to the recent pace of the game, and it seemed that he would have to trudge along this plain until he dropped.
Here is the translation of the text:

Despite this, he still favored his own legs, honestly recording this spell into his mind like a treasure within his heart.

Originally, these spells required 24 hours of dedicated research to master, but Zhao Xu possessed the ability of "Wisdom of Spellcasting" and had reached level 4 in terms of magical knowledge and spell recognition. Therefore, he didn't need to spend so much time researching the spell again.

Unless he was extremely unlucky, it would take 24 hours to complete the reading.

After applying a stimulating medicine to stimulate his mental faculties on his temples, Zhao Xu began to read the scroll.

The candles cast a warm glow, and the tent was quiet, except for the snores of the three male players and the rustling of the pages being turned by Zhao Xu and his companion.

Suddenly, a loud roar echoed through the air, accompanied by the buzzing of enemy scouting bees, sounding urgent and worried.
