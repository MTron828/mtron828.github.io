Chapter 287: Tomb of the Crown

The "Wraith" itself cannot cause any physical attacks and can only absorb attributes. It is completely helpless against Zhao Xu. However, Zhao Xu, who has sensed the unusual plot, boldly approaches the front.

The "Wraith" itself is a completely insane soul and cannot be communicated with. Moreover, as Zhao Xu gets closer, the whispering voice in his ear becomes louder, and the space around him becomes increasingly eerie. The "Wraith" hovering above his head looks like a ghostly aura.

As a male and a "Mage" and "Priest" with innate abilities to deal with undead creatures, Zhao Xu is confident in facing these beings.

At this time, he is completely focused and begins to observe these undead creatures.

Knowing that each building in "Sleeping Land" is actually a "Haunted Mansion" once inhabited by King Arthur, he is also slightly worried about the possibility of Queen Shang Wei and Isviel hiding in this city.

The 20+ level 3 "Wraiths" with IDs starting with "Low" are not a problem for Zhao Xu, even if he uses the power of "Soul Master". However, the IDs starting with "Middle" and "High" are extremely dangerous, and even Zhao Xu may not be able to defeat them.

Zhao Xu's gaze falls on the Wraith hovering above the ceiling, and he scans them one by one, as if identifying them.

Looking puzzled, Lakshmi said, "We've heard that the few assassins were thrown into this place and left to be dealt with by these Wraiths. It sounds quite relieving."

"But this is actually a method to eliminate the Wraiths, not to create the 'Anatta City'."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's like the 'yǔ hún' template, where only after they complete their unfinished business can they dissipate normally. The 'yuān hún' may not necessarily dissipate either, but they do have some similarities."

Lakshmi listened to Zhao Xu's analysis, "Are you saying that the ones who were thrown in aren't the actual culprits?"

However, Zhao Xu shook his head. "I just listened to the whispers of 22 yuān hún here, and then established a record, and analyzed them based on the names and contents mentioned in their speeches, and I found something."

After his memory improved, Zhao Xu was able to directly draft in his mind, even if the information was chaotic. He could tidy it up one by one.

"They may have been kidnapped and tortured by the four culprits, but the true mastermind is someone else."

Zhao Xu's tone was icy cold, and he turned to look at the mysterious painting on the corner of the staircase.

"It's because the ones who were used as sacrifices by the culprits also became 'yuān hún'! They're also struggling to justify their actions."

"The yuān hún itself has the supernatural ability to 'go mad', and anyone who tries to detect, control, or sense their minds will be affected by a sense of unease. This may have caused the town to initially remain unaware of the truth."

Zhao Xu, who now possessed the "undying being" trait, was immune to attribute damage, but not attribute absorption. So he didn't dare to try. After his analysis, he found that there were still many inconsistencies in the yuān hún's dialogue, as if everyone was describing different things. He could only continue to dig up evidence.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but look towards the rooms connected to the hall.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

If the four people who tortured the tourists were themselves controlled by someone using "magic," it would mean that this haunted house was intentionally created. This would imply that the priests of the dead gods are suspicious. Their job is to exorcise or command undead creatures. It is the priests of the benevolent gods who should perform the rituals to dispel or destroy undead creatures. However, the opponent directly put the perpetrator into the haunted house, which is a method that even benevolent priests cannot do. This has drawn everyone's attention. This indicates that from the beginning, the house itself was a deliberate action with a premeditated purpose.

After Lakis' speculation, Zhao Xu also slowed down his pace, exploring other rooms in the completely dark space. He had felt that he might have unintentionally touched the truth of the "Sleeping Ground" by chance.

According to Lakis, the entire city is composed of "haunted houses" where undead creatures appear. However, Zhao Xu has discovered that these places seem to have been intentionally created. Even murder itself may have been intentional. This may suggest that the appearance of "Anata City" was not a natural occurrence. Thus, "Anata City" is not just a simple city with undead creatures.

Zhao Xu gently pushed open a half-closed door and found that the furniture inside was also cleared out, indicating that the interior furnishings were removed when the house was moved. After confirming there were no other abnormalities, Zhao Xu also tried to enter the room, which was approximately three meters by four meters in size, and slowly made his way to the window on the nailed door.
Here is the translation of the text:

This time, there was no sudden appearance of blood handprints. Instead, it was the same old folk magic that was said to "exorcise the restless spirits."

"What?" Laxus exclaimed.

Zhao Xu also focused intently on the wooden board, understanding what Laxus was saying.

All the wooden boards nailed to the interior of the room had nail marks made by fingernails, as if someone had struggled to escape from within. However, the vengeful spirit itself did not leave any physical marks.

"This is what the few perpetrators who were locked in here have left behind?" Laxus speculated.

Zhao Xu just nodded and didn't say much.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu knelt down and stroked the floor, which had become uneven due to lack of maintenance. Then, he took out a climbing hook from his backpack and inserted it into the crack in the floorboards. With a sudden jerk, he flipped over a section of the wooden floor that was only slightly larger than a single step.

The red blood characters, which had been staring at Zhao Xu, suddenly occupied his field of vision.

Behind these wooden boards, the blood-red ritual incantations were carved.

Zhao Xu, who had been convinced by his own judgment, could only shake his head in disappointment. These evil priests had done something that was utterly despicable.

No wonder the former God of Death was part of the evil faction.

This room had already been set up with this ritual to transform vengeful spirits when the floor was first laid. Everything that happened later was all part of a deliberate plan.

Having understood this, Zhao Xu stood up directly.

"It seems that each building in this scattered city has its own deeper meaning in its layout."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu gazed at the ground beneath his feet, he feared that there might be a corresponding ritual and magic beneath it, operating this city. The question was, what was the purpose of the city that the God of Death had established during his lifetime, and what kind of layout had he set up? Moreover, he had left behind some divine power, which was later seized by "Edmond".

This layout was so intricate that even after the God of Death's demise, it had not been discovered. It was like a mage's backup plan, which would only be used if all else failed. Zhao Xu knew he had stumbled upon a heavenly secret.

However, he had already reached a dead end and could only continue forward like "Edmond" in the past. "What's next, master?" Lark noticed the gravity of the situation.

But Zhao Xu remained calm, recalling that he had used the "Divine Mark" twice before, each time increasing the destructive power against the city. "When I unleash the 'Soul Master' for the last time, it's likely that the entire city will be shaken to its core. At that point, we might understand the true meaning of the ritual set up in the city."

"As for now, let's just make the most of our situation," he said, pulling out a bundle of white wax from his backpack and a lighter. He put on a glove and used the lighter to heat the wax, shaping it into a ring about 10 centimeters in diameter.

Without the "Howard Convenience Bag", Zhao Xu had to do without many of his magical tools. Magic required a variety of elements, including incantations, poses, materials, and equipment.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

The materials used are consumable, and any material that costs less than 1 gold coin can be replaced with the "Lawless Material" ability. However, "equipment" is impossible to replace, and the white wax ring in Zhao Xuan's hand, which is made of white wax, is also the same.

After completing the task, Zhao Xuan put the ring on his head, and then pulled out a bundle wrapped in cloth from his pocket, gently scattering the soil from the tomb in front of him.

Next, Zhao Xuan began to chant, his low voice resembling the mournful whispers of the tomb.

Slowly, under the driving force of Zhao Xuan's incantation and the seal in his hand, the soil from the tomb began to rise into the air, bit by bit, wrapping itself around his white wax head ring.

Then, a dark and cold white energy cluster appeared on the palm of Zhao Xuan's hand, accompanied by an ominous aura. He decisively poured it onto his head.

"Mausoleum Crown."

The original white wax head ring was taken off by Zhao Xuan, and a ghostly mist formed a new ring on his head, which then disappeared.

Finally, only a magic-made bone crown hovered above his head.
