Chapter 023: Awakening Ritual

Less than ten minutes had passed when a maid came to knock on the door. However, before Zhao Xu could get up, Anzinnia opened the door, bowed her head slightly, and quickly put down a box of things before leaving.

Zhao Xu only then realized that Anzinnia's awakening method was not just reading a book, but rather combining materials.

"'Awakening as a 'Wise Heart Practitioner' is very simple. After I set up the ritual, you just sit there for a bit, and it's done," Anzinnia said as she opened the box.

Zhao Xu looked confused, "Is it that simple?"

The ritual that had taken him so long to master was now being described as simple. Some players had already mastered certain abilities, but were still stuck on mastering "Transcribing Scrolls" and "Summoning Pets".

Zhao Xu thought that he had to master those two abilities before he could awaken as a "Wise Heart Practitioner". But now, it seemed that wasn't the case.

"If I awaken as a 'Wise Heart Practitioner' and then don't become a 1st-level mage, wouldn't it be like I wasted a skill?" Zhao Xu asked.

Anzinnia's cloak slightly shifted as she looked at him.

"What's going through your mind? As long as you don't become a 1st-level mage within a certain period of time, these additional skills you obtained will be lost. Except for your Dragon Language, which is intelligence-based."

"Only after completing the first-level profession can it become the anchor for all your profession abilities, solidifying them. Moreover, I advise you not to try to find loopholes or shortcuts."

"For thousands of years, people have tried various methods, including many new mages who like to make a living by copying magic books and selling them. Even Zhao Xu had similar plans, because copying for others can earn money, and only fools wouldn't do it. However, this magic is not exclusive to him."

"Think about it, why can't magic books be directly photocopied or have someone with an extremely strong memory memorize them? Why do they need to research and memorize them?"

"When copying, you need to understand the entire model of how it works, so each stroke is your own insight. However, this insight is not sustainable. You can only re-prepares the magic by feeling the insight from the magic book. This is the way of magic casting determined by mages."

"This is what most mages know when copying magic. However, they don't know that lending the original magic book to someone to copy may damage the original book. The model of the original book will be destroyed, and each copying carries the risk of erasing the original magic."

When Zhao Xu heard this, he was shocked to realize that lending the original book to someone to make a copy may damage the original book.
Here is the translation:

In this situation, even if the other party has copied the spell, it's still necessary to spend 50 GP or 12.5 GP per page to have it copied again from the other party. This is too troublesome, and it's unlikely that ordinary people would easily lend out spellbooks, let alone to someone who isn't a very good friend. The model itself is worn out, and who knows how much it's been damaged.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking this, Anita was already using the materials brought by the maid to draw on the ground in front of his dormitory. Arthur's mage used gestures and incantations, and added more materials. It was rare to need such a big action to draw on the ground, so it wasn't a spellcasting.

"This is a ritual," Anita said, finishing a six-pointed star and continuing to draw some strange symbols with a special pen-like object.

"A ritual is an independent system outside of spellcasting, and it intersects with spellcasting. For example, it can achieve similar effects to spellcasting through long-term rituals. However, it's not suitable for combat because it takes a long time. But it's one of the ways for ordinary people without spellbooks to display mysterious abilities."

"Some rituals are like this, used to awaken professional abilities. These are common in various professional abilities."

"Through this ritual, your abilities such as 'copying spellbooks' and 'summoning pets' will be advanced, and you will no longer be able to obtain them. Have you thought about this?"

Zhao Xu nodded firmly, having made up his mind and had no regrets.

Moreover, Anita had also made this choice, and he didn't believe he could really lose.

"That's it, just sit down in the middle of the ritual," Anita said.

Zhao Xu stood up immediately and followed Anita's instructions to sit down directly in the drawn ritual circle.

As Zhao Xǔ gazed at the six-pointed star, each of its six corners lit up a white candle. Beside him, there were mysterious powders scattered by the unknown entity, as well as his own shadowy figure that seemed to oscillate between reality and illusion.

Zhao Xǔ's heart skipped a beat. This scene was not typical of the usual horror movies in the Western world, where some novice sorcerers would try to conjure up demons.

"Even if the Great Devil King arrives, I can still send it back," An Ti Nuó Yǎ said. "What are you worrying about?"

Zhao Xǔ could only try to comfort himself. In reality, with An Ti Nuó Yǎ's legendary magical prowess, it was highly likely that she could confront and defeat the demonic avatars of the Great Devil King.

"You hold this paper, recite the incantation on it, and then begin to meditate on your inner self as a boundless and profound road," An Ti Nuó Yǎ said. A piece of paper floated in front of Zhao Xǔ's eyes.

Zhao Xǔ was suspicious - his teacher, who was supposed to be a genius with an IQ of 50, had actually prepared a "defect" similar to amnesia. Why did she only reveal it to him at the last minute?

Fortunately, the incantation itself was not difficult to memorize, and Zhao Xǔ managed to learn it under the pressure of the mystical ritual.

Immediately after, he closed his eyes and imagined himself walking on a profound road.

At that moment, Zhao Xǔ failed to notice that An Ti Nuó Yǎ had pulled out a holy seal of the Magic Goddess and placed it on a symbol array drawn on the altar. She then pulled out a bottle of holy water and poured it onto the seal, all the while chanting an incomprehensible incantation.
Here is the translation of the text:

The intricate magical array drawn by her suddenly came to life, and began to glow with a fiery intensity, emitting flashes of light that seemed to pulse with energy. With a loud "boom", Zhao Xū's inner world was struck by a powerful blow, as if his heart had been shattered.

He suddenly opened his eyes, gazing straight ahead.

The glow from the magical array on the ground vanished in the instant he opened his eyes.

Each brushstroke of the original drawing began to fade away, gradually disappearing until they coalesced back into the holy seal.

Just as Zhao Xū was about to ask Anzhi Noya if she had succeeded, he noticed that his character panel had changed. The ability feature, "Wisdom User", was quietly sitting in its place.
