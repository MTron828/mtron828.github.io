Chapter 216: Winter City

In his previous life, Zhao Xu was a law enforcement official in a small town and possessed a +1 enchanted magic weapon.

Although it was not as powerful as the +2 or +3 level magic weapons wielded by the high-ranking warriors, Zhao Xu was already satisfied with his own weapon.

Warriors who possessed magic weapons were like members of a prestigious car club. They didn't have to beg for scraps from the mages every day to get a "magic weapon" to pass the time.

In the early days, mages themselves were often short on magic points, so it was not easy for them to spare magic points to enhance the weapons of warriors.

The most obvious characteristic of a +1 magic weapon was that it directly increased the wielder's attack power by 1 level.

If that was the only effect, it would be tolerable.

The key point was that many monsters had damage reduction, and warriors often struggled to penetrate the monsters' defenses and deal damage with their swords.

However, they would find that the damage would instantly dissipate into nothingness, which was the power of damage reduction.

Fortunately, most damage reduction would be accompanied by weaknesses, and the most common weakness was that the damage reduction could be pierced by magic weapons.

Even if it was another weakness, magic weapons would often have special effects to counter it.

So, the "magic weapon" attached to Zhao Xu's "giant scythe" was only natural.

The scythe itself was originally a valuable "crafted item" worth hundreds of gold coins, and then it was converted into a "magic weapon" through an enchantment process by a mage.

The "giant scythe" in front of Zhao Xu was just a standard issue equipment that could be purchased for 18 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, if it's a refined product, it will require an additional 300 gold coins to purchase it, reaching a total of 318 gold coins.

After becoming a magical weapon, its price will be determined by the enhancement level, which is usually between +1 to +5 within the legendary range.

However, magical weapons are not just about increasing attack power and damage output. They can also have special effects attached to them. The value of a magical weapon is determined by its rarity and is divided into fixed gold coin amounts or "+1" to "+5" increments.

For example, Zhao Xu once transformed into a heavenly servant and possessed a +5 dance void great sword.

The "+5" represents the maximum enhancement level of the magical weapon. The "dance void" is a special ability that allows the owner to leave their hands empty. The evaluation of this ability is equivalent to a +5 enhancement.

Therefore, the price adjustment of a +5 dance void great sword is equivalent to a +10 enhancement. This is the limit of magical weapons in the legendary range.

The highest it can be stacked is +10.

For example, the +1 yao yuan great scythe in front of Zhao Xu has a weapon enhancement level of +1, and the "yao yuan" effect also adjusts the price by +1, making the total price adjustment equivalent to +2.

After thousands of years of market fluctuations, magical weapons have become a stable high-end trade, except for occasional local wars. The price adjustment range is from "+1" to "+10", with the cheapest being "+1", which costs 2000 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "+2" price adjustment will boost the price by 8000 gold coins, which means that the +1 Shadowy Giant Scythe in Zhao Xu's possession will increase from its original price of 318 gold coins to 8318 gold coins due to the enhancement of its "+1" and Shadowy attributes.

These magical weapons are also the most valuable collateral, so warriors are willing to spend a large sum of money to purchase one.

As a result, even though Zhao Xu is currently considered a small wealthy individual, seeing the "Fearful Spirit" drop from the opponent's escape due to fleeing, he will find it hard to resist the temptation.

It's true that taking great risks can lead to great rewards.

The Shadowy weapon is also a rare equipment that can only be dropped, even if you try ten times, it's unlikely to drop successfully.

However, with this weapon, Zhao Xu will truly become a warrior in the future, and even if he faces the spirits of the dead, he won't be at a loss.

As Zhao Xu's hands, which have held countless weapons in his previous life, consider this to be just an ordinary magical weapon.

Zhao Xu then walked to the front, standing before the transmission door leading to the "Half-Plane of the Flesh-Eating Beast".

The edge of the transmission door is a stone frame, and inside, a blue and white magical energy wave is constantly emanating, indicating that anyone who enters the door can be transported to the target location.

This time, Zhao Xu has experienced many transmissions through these doors after leaving the Floating City, and he is no longer excited like he was the first time he went through one.

Usually, when people reach this stage, they would typically hold the "Key" scythe and slowly enter the transmission door, waiting for the challenge to come.

However, Zhao Xu has already become a versatile mage.
Here is the translation:

Compared to other players, he has grown wings and can see a larger world outside. Since he has the highest limit of 17 two-ring spells, he will pay the price for information. This experience during this practice has told him that everything is not as simple as it seems. He even suspects whether the giant scythe in his hand is the true key.

Or maybe the key to this transmission portal is not just one. Otherwise, the key to this transmission portal might be hidden in the "Fearful Ensnarement" of the opponent, which is too extreme. Therefore, Zhaoxu thought for a while and decided to solve it according to the wizard's thought process. Since he didn't know, he let the spell tell him.

As soon as he knew the target was the transmission portal, Zhaoxu's mind flashed with a spell - "Analysis of Transmission Portal". This spell is a three-ring spell of the wizard and the poet, but it is also a two-ring domain spell of the transmission domain. Therefore, as a 3rd-level scroll scholar, Zhaoxu could cast it.

He took out a mirror and a small mirror from his backpack, which he had bought at the market that morning, and cast the spell according to the incantation in his mind. The casting time of this spell was almost a minute.

Zhaoxu had previously cast the "Identification Spell" for an hour, so he could maintain his patience. Until the final incantation was finished, his two-ring divine position in his mind suddenly disappeared, and the crystal mirror and mirror in his hand directly merged into one, forming a bright light that covered his entire body.
Here is the translation:

Immediately, Zhao Xu felt that his entire body was like a radar, with energy waves spreading out from within him, beginning to locate the teleportation portal or "interdimensional portal" spell within an 18-meter range. The energy all converged on this high platform, where there was only one teleportation portal.

As a 5th-level spellcaster, Zhao Xu could sustain this spell for nearly 5 rounds. He could obtain information from this portal every round.

Each piece of information would pop up on his dynamic panel, revealing the secrets of the portal. However, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed as he gazed at the information.

He gripped the giant scythe and stepped through the portal in front of him. A "random" teleportation effect would be added, causing him to be teleported to a different location.

At his destination, a temporary teleportation portal would be constructed, lasting for five days, and only he could pass through it. His mission was to find this portal and, once he stepped through it, he could directly reach the legendary half-plane.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, and the battlefield suddenly shifted to a different location.

This meant that variables would increase dramatically.

Although the portal was only accessible to him, he would face external interference from various players and NPCs, including Arthur's tribe.

Zhao Xu gazed at the "gem" buried in the corner. As long as he was in the same plane, he could use the "Gem Jump" spell to successfully return to any location where the gem was located.

However, when he returned, the portal would not return.

Each person could only activate the portal's power once every 10 years.
Zhou Xu relied on the "Analytical Portal" technique and skipped numerous speculations, directly reaching the target. This is also a powerful effect of the technique. It can eliminate gaps, verify speculations, and reverse reality. Zhou Xu thought for a moment and then confidently walked forward. As it turned out, his "Analytical Portal" was also a powerful tool. As long as he could determine the portal area, he could use this technique to locate the specific position of the hidden portal. Therefore, he didn't need to take a chance like others. Gradually, Zhou Xu walked into the portal, and the spatial power began to pull his body. A flash of white light passed by. Zhou Xu's eyes lit up. In front of him was the familiar "Wandering Path", with wine shops, restaurants, and a large marketplace nearby, where the sounds of players calling out and haggling could be heard continuously. The nearby shops had already stacked their goods on the pavement, while the blacksmith's chimney stood tall in the distance, continuously spewing out thick smoke, creating a lively street scene. Zhou Xu revealed a smile of satisfaction. He had returned to the Winter City, which was familiar to him from ten years ago.
