Chapter 501: Pointing to the Lair

"Is that you?" The sister exclaimed suddenly, recognizing the voice of Zhao Xu as she took a closer look.

"Little sister, do you recognize him?" The Saint Warrior's eyes widened in surprise, unable to connect the man in front of him to the carriage that had fallen into the abyss.

"It seems you've recognized me, Miss Ran Nu," Zhao Xu said with a wide smile, although he hadn't thought it would be so coincidental.

The brother and sister standing before him were none other than the Shen Nian and Shen Ze siblings, whom he had known in his past life. Before the Battle of Star Lake, he had encountered Shen Nian at a stall in Winter City, where she went by the name of Miss Ran Nu.

At the time, Zhao Xu had identified the bronze lion statue worth over 10,000 gold coins on the stall and given it to Shen Nien to give to her brother.

"Brother, that's the same mage who helped us choose the bronze mount," Shen Nien exclaimed, her voice trembling with excitement, as she shook her brother's arm.

Shen Ze, who had been looking at Zhao Xu with a skeptical expression, suddenly widened his eyes. "So it's you."

As he spoke, he extended his strong and muscular arm, tightly gripping Zhao Xu's hand. "According to market standards, you helped us choose this magical item, and we should compensate you. However, my little sister didn't understand the situation and didn't have the chance to thank you."

Zhao Xu nodded directly, saying, "No, it was just a coincidence."

Shen Nien interrupted her brother's awkward expression, saying, "Let me introduce you to my brother, a 4th-level Saint Warrior and judge of Winter City, and a member of the Holy Guardian Knights."
Here is the translation of the text:

As I, Ruan Yi, a winter city mage, am also a 4th-level mage. Shen Nian smiled brightly and said, "It's not surprising that the Shen siblings, who are famous in the winter city, have reached this level."

Zhao Xu paused for a moment, then looked at Shen Nian with a serious expression. "After all, Shen Nian is a mage in the art of magic, and has reached the 4th level. However, as a mage, it takes time to master the higher-level spells."

Shen Nian asked, "Sir, who are you?"

Zhao Xu replied simply, "Summer."

As of now, he can even introduce himself with just a name in the player community.

Even poets can use the "逸闻知识" (knowledge of remote legends) to search for this ID and obtain some information.

Instantly, the Shen siblings, who had already surpassed many players in the winter city and were considered high-level players, all stared at Zhao Xu in shock.

It was as if they couldn't believe that the benevolent person who had helped them in the past was actually a powerful hidden BOSS.

The ID "Summer" might just be an ordinary name outside the game.

But within the game, this short name had accumulated an endless amount of energy storm.

Even a casual player who just wanted to play the game and enjoy the scenery would know that "Summer" is currently the number one player in the game.

A player who has surpassed the second-ranked player by two levels, an extremely powerful player.

Even on online forums and some blogs, the analysis of this name has become countless.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some people directly search for users with the same ID on other websites, trying to find the true identity of the player known as Zhong Xia.

At times, not being in the same circle, it's like being a blade of grass. But for top-tier people in the same circle, it's like a thunderclap that shocks everyone.

Zhao Xu, who always felt inferior to An Ningyu, was a bit awkward when he saw his familiar face with an unfamiliar gaze. Shen Ze held his hand tightly, as if he was about to burst with excitement.

However, Zhao Xu, who had just leveled up using the power of the "Decline Domain," was now invincible against Shen Ze's attacks, which had increased in power. As the current strongest player, Zhao Xu felt a bit ashamed that he couldn't even play a decent melee role.

"Sorry about that," Shen Ze finally reacted, releasing his grip on Zhao Xu's hand.

The curious Shen siblings then bombarded Zhao Xu with many questions.

In reality, they didn't want to touch on Zhao Xu's level-up secrets and instead asked many other questions.

However, Zhao Xu's secrets were too numerous to explain, and his upgrade was growing wildly. Fortunately, he was intelligent enough to round off the numbers without revealing too many secrets.

As Zhao Xu engaged in this conversation, he also learned that his opponent had braved the harsh winter to investigate a series of missing persons' cases.

Shen Ze had traveled all the way from the Winter's City to the Auror City, following the clues to the mountains. His sister had accompanied him, worried about his safety.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder, "The Sacred Guardian Knights should not allow you to come here alone, should they?"

Shen Ze looked somewhat melancholy and said, "It's mainly because this matter has no direction at the moment, and the priority is temporarily unclear. So, our team was assigned to take charge of it, and we divided to investigate separately to speed up the process."

Zhao Xu suddenly realized and asked, "Have you found any leads?"

"I've heard that there's a secret base on the ice mountain range," Shen Ze said hesitantly. "I suspect it's located there."

"Who?" Zhao Xu asked.

"The Six Sisters," Shen Ze replied, looking troubled. "Our knight squad has been tracking the Six Sisters for many years, but they've been hiding the location of their hostages. My sister suspects that they're hiding in the ice mountain range, but the main roads are heavily guarded, and it's impossible for the Six Sisters to pass through with a large group of slaves without being detected."

"So, our small team will split up to monitor some difficult-to-reach paths to observe whether the Six Sisters have a special method of climbing," Shen Ze said.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood and knew that Shen Ze had actually found a crucial clue, despite seeming to stumble upon it by chance.

Even according to the opponent's given time nodes, the time gap between the Six Sisters' raids on Floria and Elric's wives was shorter than expected. Although they rushed to climb down and infiltrate the city of Orlu, it seemed like an urgent order.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's entire being became calm, and he was secretly thinking about the new information provided by Shen Ze's siblings.

In theory, they should have known this information and should have reported it to the alliance immediately.
Here is the translation of the text:

But he didn't receive it, as if someone had forcibly interrupted part of the critical information. While Zhao Xu was passing through the city of Orlu, he realized that he needed to "take advantage of the situation" in the mysterious storm on the ice valley. He pretended to be dead and escaped. He then got on a horse-drawn carriage and, to be honest, he saw the bright lights in the dark night, attracting the attention of various forces. "Ah, I'm going to find the six sisters now," Zhao Xu said, casually mentioning his current rescue mission to the two people.

Immediately, Shen Nian and Shen Ze both furrowed their brows, clearly aware of the huge crisis hidden behind the scene. "I need your help," Zhao Xu said softly.

Realizing that the six sisters might have a secret base on the ice mountain, holding many hostages and slaves, Zhao Xu understood that this was not just a personal heroism, where he could save Floria and Lady Aily by himself.

Without external power, those who were kidnapped would all be frozen to death on their way down the mountain.

"But, Brother Zhongxia," Shen Nian asked, "isn't it more effective to seek help from the official alliance?"

Zhao Xu smiled and shook his head, and Shen Nian still didn't understand the situation. He believed too much in the official information in the game.

"I'm trying to avoid them," Zhao Xu said. "It's not just a high-level issue, but the entire information network, with the six sisters' faction having a choice, and even a force opposing me, wishing Floria and Lady Aily to die in their hands."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he spoke, he gazed at Saint Warrior Shen Ze, "If the Northern Alliance has something that is most reliable, it's the knight team subordinate to the God of Justice, I'm sure it's among the top three."

Suddenly, Shen Ze's face turned red with excitement, and he immediately pressed the hilt of his long sword against his chest, "Honor is my life, justice is my soul."

Seeing this oath, Zhao Xu nodded silently and began to roughly sketch a map of the ice mountain range on the frozen ground, then handed it over to Shen Ze and his sister Shen Nian.

Saint Warriors are strongest at being independent of government departments, similar to the existence of "prosecutors" and "courts".

Each Saint Warrior is like an independent prosecutor, with enough power to mobilize the strength of the entire knight team.

It was only a suspicion before, but with Zhao Xu's conclusive evidence, many things became clear.

"Brother Zhongxiao, how did you know the hideout of the six sisters?" Shen Nian asked, looking at Zhao Xu with an expression of extreme surprise, as if he was one of the six sisters.

At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath and gazed out the door of the ice-carved cottage, saying nothing.

His thoughts, however, had already drifted back to his past life.

He had followed a woman to the ice mountain range and discovered the truth, but then they parted ways.

"Ah," Zhao Xu suddenly thought of a question he had always wanted to ask but was afraid to ask Shen Ze, fearing Shen Ze would kill him.

Shen Ze slapped his chest, eagerly awaiting Zhao Xu's question.

Zhao Xu flashed a bright smile, looking at Shen Ze with a mischievous glint in his eye and asked, "Are you a sister-obsessed?"
