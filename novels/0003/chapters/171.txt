Chapter 172: Enemies in the Woods

After Esvehi's words, the surrounding players couldn't help but take a glance at the entire relay station.

"Don't be foolish, the person tasked with tracking and observing us will not be so easy to find," Esvehi said.

Although Mistral has numerous paths leading to various towns in Arthur, including multiple portals to other planes.

However, for ordinary residents of Arthur, aside from walking on foot, the relay station's horse-drawn carriage rental service is a relatively comfortable way to travel.

This time, the group of twenty people, including Wang Qingwei, were heading to the border town of Frost Tree in Mistral, where they would contact the local justice official to obtain information about the bandit gang, and then gradually unfold their plan.

However, they encountered a problem in the first step of how to get to Frost Tree. The floating city did not arrange any guides for them, and at most, only told them where to go and who to meet.

The entire process was left to the players themselves to figure out.

So, the group decided to hire a few horse-drawn carriages at the relay station, hoping to rely on the knowledgeable coachmen to bring them to their destination.

There are too many rumors about the wilderness on the forum.

At this time, Zhao Xu was standing beside a load-bearing cedar pillar, observing the group of twenty people from the shadows.

He held a magical tome in his hand, which described the ritual for traveling to the outer plane hero domain of Jospe's Garden.
Zhao Xu was quite curious about this ritual, because anyone who died in the Jose Garden would be able to revive at dawn the next day, just like they had undergone the "Complete Revival" effect of the 9th-level revival magic. Zhao Xu immediately thought about how to abuse this spatial effect.

However, after listening to Eswein's words, Zhao Xu still chose to be honest and leaned against the sturdy wooden beam behind him. At the same time, he was inspecting the environment of this relay station, trying to infer information about another "guardian".

If it was just a group of ordinary players, then Floating City might still use a nurturing approach to let players fend for themselves, otherwise it wouldn't be a task. However, considering the presence of Wang Qingwei and his own possibilities, Zhao Xu speculated that this team must have at least 20 people.

As for the opponent, it could be someone who was hiding and tracking like him, or using a divination spell like Eagle Eye to monitor the situation. At this time, Jiangshan returned from talking to the relay station staff, looking down at the players and saying, "The relay station said that all the spare horses have been requisitioned, and the regular horse-drawn carriages to Frostwood Town won't be able to depart until tomorrow afternoon."

After hearing this, several nearby players couldn't help but furrow their brows, indicating that their journey ahead would be troublesome. Jiangshan also looked worried, realizing that he had failed to win over this group of players and couldn't take the initiative to lead their travel arrangements. He had given up on getting the magical items from Wang Qingwei after being rebuffed several times.

Confronting a formidable opponent, he needs to think of a way to take away the implicit leadership from them. After listening to everyone's conversation, Zhao Xiu had a few possibilities flash through his mind.

He took out the sheepskin paper that the middle-aged woman had given him and examined it again. One of the pages was a simplified map from Mistral to Frostwood Town. Originally, Zhao Xiu thought he would start worrying about the safety of the team only after reaching Frostwood Town. Now he realized that there might be an invisible hand manipulating everything from behind the scenes.

With no extra carriages, such a ridiculous story could only deceive people like Jiang Shan, who had no common sense. As the core town in the surrounding area, Mistral was unlikely to have no extra carriages. Moreover, the carriage going to Frostwood Town would not arrive until the next day.

It was clear that there was a black hand manipulating everything from behind the scenes, forcing the players to arrive at Frostwood Town at a slower pace. Zhao Xiu looked at the map and roughly calculated the distance with his fingers.

Suddenly, he felt a sinking feeling in his heart.

Coincidence was getting too much. According to the carriage speed, they could have reached Frostwood Town before nightfall. Now, relying solely on their legs, they would have to take temporary shelter in the wild.

As expected, after hearing Jiang Shan's words, Aiswich and Wang Qingwei both looked thoughtful. Having been exposed to the entire itinerary earlier, they quickly realized what they would face that night.

Nighttime raids were always the most detested form of attack for players. Even if they resisted the attack, using magic that night would still be counted towards the next day's magic quota. Using one magic would reduce the quota for the next day.

At this time, Zhao Xu could only hope that these players would log off safely at night, otherwise, his head would be spinning. He even couldn't help but think of casting a "Break Illusion" spell on himself to see if there was a mage from the Floating Sky City, sneering at these players.

"Won't we be able to reach Frost Tree Town tonight? Why don't we set a schedule for our log-in and log-out times for tonight and tomorrow, and then we can set off together?" Wang Qingwei suggested.

"What? We can't even make it today?"

"It's okay, let's coordinate our schedules. As long as we're all coordinated, we can basically make it to this task."

Meanwhile, Jiang Shan looked at everyone discussing and hastily said, "Don't worry, I'll take everyone to the Adventurer's Home nearby to buy some camping gear and supplies. If we're still short, I can cover the cost. Tonight, let's just have a bonfire party."

As he said this, he also glanced at Wang Qingwei with a hint of pride.

What could be better than having an adventure in the wilderness, exchanging feelings around the bonfire?

Wang Qingwei looked at everyone accepting Jiang Shan's suggestion and didn't say a word, only smiling silently and sitting back down.

...

After leaving the city with the main force, Zhao Xu found a corner and used the "Summon Mount" spell to summon a light horse for himself.

With his current 6th-level spellcasting level, the duration of his mount's effect has also increased to 12 hours, basically sufficient to last until nightfall.

Under the effect of the "Illusion" spell, Zhao Xu's mount and even the Ayn stone suspended above his head also became invisible, along with the other players in the scene, all of whom were walking on their own two legs, unlike Wang Qingwei and a few other spellcasters who had mastered the "Summon Mount" spell.

They all gazed at Wang Congwei and Aisvi with envious eyes, secretly thinking that one day they would also have enough money to learn this spell.

Riding such things is only possible by walking on foot, and only then can one truly appreciate the convenience of it.

The Jiangshan chose "Summon Mount" as their free learnable spell from the beginning, citing comfort as the reason. However, later he found that the players' spell slots were very limited, so he decided to hold back on using the spell for the time being, thinking that it would be useful in a critical moment in front of everyone.

The main road from Mistral to Frost Tree Town was a winding path through the forest, where low-growing shrubs were common.

Although the wizard team was composed of scattered players from Mistral, they could still coordinate well and divide themselves into three groups to advance.

"Do you think there's a risk tonight?" Aisvi whispered softly, controlling her short-statured horse to move closer to Wang Congwei's side.

"We should be more cautious and then log off after the bonfire gathering," Wang Congwei said reassuringly.

Aisvi looked at the new wizard players who were still excited and enthusiastic, with a look of disdain. "They really think they're going on a picnic, and they haven't seen the forum post 'One Hundred and One Ways to Die in the Wild'."

"None of us have gone out," Wang Congwei said with a smile.

However, she looked at the wizards in the front who were still chatting, with a furrowed brow and a worried heart, analyzing this adventure and how it would test them.

After discussing it, the majority opinion was to take a detour and choose a longer route to save a quarter of the journey time, even if it meant taking some risks.
Here is the translation:

While Zhao Xu remained seated on his mount, he was inspecting his spellcasting position. He focused all his attention on tonight's wave of night raids, thinking about his spellcasting position arrangement.

"Ah——"

Suddenly, the mage player at the front let out a cry and fell to the ground.

An arrow was lodged in his chest.
