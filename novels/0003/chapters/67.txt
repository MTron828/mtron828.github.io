Chapter 068 - The Path of the Mage

In the following days, Zhao Xu was diligent in improving his abilities and had no further interactions with players.

After Anniya's explanation, he finally understood that his mage skills had resonated with the source of magic in the three main fields.

As a result, he instantly elevated his "Discernment Magic" skill to level 4.

Anniya also cast the "Rainbow Magic Ball" to test this point.

At the same time, he was quickly sent to receive a "Magic Missile", which was also to quickly utilize the remaining power of the source, allowing him to directly grasp the "Counter Magic" ability.

The only ripple effect of this event was that some players who witnessed the scene in the underground square posted a thread on the forum, highlighting two points: Zhao Xu was speaking in a normal tone and not using the common tongue, and the "Magic Missile" cast by the female mage failed to launch successfully.

The conclusion drawn from this was that "Zhao Xu is a player who has mastered the Counter Magic ability", which was met with ridicule by many forum experts.

As no one has ever mastered this ability from the time the game started to the present, it is indeed a remarkable achievement for Zhao Xu to have achieved this feat in just 7-14 days, surpassing the record of 20 days set by the city of Mistral, which is renowned for producing talented mages.

Zhao Xu's only response was to like a comment on the opposing thread.

Meanwhile, the stimulation from the magic field allowed Zhao Xu to gain some knowledge of the source of magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu spends most of his time every day in the library of the floating city, browsing through various books.

Compared to when he first started, it didn't take him long to level up to the 1st level of knowledge (mysterious). He quickly upgraded most of his knowledge and skills.

After completing his skills, he also tidied up the extra language skills he had learned.

Then, Zhao Xu followed Anzhi Noya to the 7th floor of the spire, known as the "Secret Star Cross".

The spire, the highest tower in the floating city, is also the location of the "Final Scroll". The spire has been expanded to provide more space, and its perimeter is surrounded by numerous magical barriers. Without a 5th-level teleportation skill, it's difficult to enter.

"Teacher, this place is quite luxurious," Zhao Xu said after taking a look at Anzhi Noya's office.

Not to mention the various demonic statues outside, the suit of armor on display in the living room was so impressive that Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a closer look.

As a warrior in his past life, Zhao Xu had always coveted this kind of armor that offered unparalleled protection.

Anzhi Noya, a mage, estimated that even she couldn't wear this armor, and the defense bonus provided by the armor may not be as high as her own magic.

"Don't touch that, it's a rare artifact," Anzhi Noya warned.

After focusing on skill enhancement for a few days, Zhao Xu felt more composed in the face of adversity.

When he heard this, his heart still skipped a beat.

"Rare artifact?"

"No, it's true. This armor is quite good, immune to many negative states, except for a low probability of magical failure. Unfortunately, as a mage, you can't wear it. But if you were a paladin, you would be a formidable opponent on the battlefield, with your divine magic complementing your skills."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu couldn't help but circle around in front of the armor, "Teacher, is it safe to leave it here and risk it being stolen?"

"The strong who can break through here will also steal, but they will steal from the bottom level. What's the point of stealing from here? It's just a low-level artifact."

"What's down there?"

"What do you think we call ourselves?" Anniya smiled.

Zhou Xu nodded, finally understanding. He realized that the legendary scroll, which was said to be guarded by the organization, was actually placed at the bottom of this tower.

The scroll contained the secrets of every magical girl's ascension.

Zhou Xu, who often pondered the inconsistencies, finally couldn't help but let his curiosity overflow when he arrived at Anniya's place.

He whispered, "Teacher, have you blocked all detection spells here?"

"What's the point? Even divine power may not be able to detect anything here." Anniya said, "The armor's greatest value is that it can disrupt divine power through the legendary spells. If you recite the true name of the divine being, the subsequent content may not be clear. Of course, don't do anything stupid, or I won't want to attract the divine being's attention."

Hearing this, Zhou Xu finally felt at ease. He realized it wasn't about being flashy.

"Teacher, since the scroll contains the secrets of ascension, why hasn't anyone stolen it to secretly read it?"

The city wall can block external enemies, but it can't stop internal traitors.

Even if you climb high, you're still a goddess's servant. Who has the leisure to be the main god?

Anniya was looking at the new public notice at the time.

"Let me tell you, basically, every legendary mage in the 'Final Scroll' has seen that scroll. So, the secret of ascension is something everyone knows."

Zhao Xu suddenly felt that the topic was too high-level for someone of his caliber, but he couldn't help but be curious.

He looked down at his own magical abilities and saw that there was no sign of disappearance, and he hurriedly asked, "Isn't this even more strange?"

At this time, Ansenia scrutinized Zhao Xu carefully and said, "Usually, such things are only discussed by those who have become high-level mages. You're quite brave to bring it up."

After Ansenia's explanation over the past few days, Zhao Xu's mental state had already undergone a significant change, unlike his cautious and meticulous nature in his past life.

"What is it?" Zhao Xu's voice was slightly raised.

"Come, learn about your next specialization, and then go out and practice well," Ansenia said with a hint of annoyance.

Zhao Xu sensed that this was the first time Ansenia had not given a straightforward answer.

Normally, even legendary secrets would be told straightforwardly by Ansenia's character.

He felt a sense of unease, suspecting that the organization "Final Scroll" might not be as simple as it seemed, as it was able to gather so many powerful legendary mages.

"You have two specializations, right?" Ansenia asked lightly.

Zhao Xu nodded, "And I also have a 1st-level specialization and a human reward specialization that hasn't been determined yet."

Earlier, he had chosen two flaw specializations, "Precognition" and "Magical Mastery".

"What do you want to improve in terms of ability?" Ansenia asked.

"Not to mention that our arrangement is rough, you can decide the order yourself," Ansenia said.

Zhao Xu was puzzled by this response.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He glanced at his spell panel and couldn't help but fall into thought.
What is he lacking the most?
The mage's daily spell slots are few, and he now has the pastor's divine magic, which is also usable.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu's eyes looked at the few spell slots that had been prepared.
"Teacher, do you have a specialization that increases freedom?" Zhao Xu asked. "Like the mysterious foresight, I want to cast whatever spell I want."
"'The Multitasking Mage' has it."
