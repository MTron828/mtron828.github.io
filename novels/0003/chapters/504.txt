Chapter 505: The Player's First-Rich

The Black Blood Peak is named after the annual harvest festival, when the three lunar cycles of high-energy tidal waves reach their peak, causing the originally snow-capped mountain peaks to resemble black, crimson blood flowing down.

As a treacherous peak on the Heavenly Disruption Mountain Range, even in the summer season, when the fierce winds have subsided, few people can survive the ascent.

The few cliffs of the Ice Original Mountain Range, except for giant dragons with a body length of over 10 meters, would be unable to withstand the wind pressure, and would be swept away into the abyss.

The ice waterfall on Black Blood Peak is a rare and extraordinary sight, known only to successful climbers.

Legend has it that it is an unparalleled masterpiece of natural art, as if crafted by a divine being.

After using the "Higher Teleportation Technique" on the seven-ring "Passage Wand" worth over 100,000 gold coins, Zhao Xiu easily crossed the numerous obstacles and arrived here, unable to help but stop and admire the breathtaking view.

The icy stream flowing down from the peak does not freeze, and its undulating motion creates an illusion of suspended animation, like a frozen waterfall sculpture.

Only by stretching out one's hand can one feel the icy, bone-chilling water.

"Hah, hah!" The white dragon Serus, who had transformed into a human, let out a loud, sarcastic cough and complained, "What's wrong with this human body? It's so weak, and it still gets sick?"

Zhao Xu looked at the white dragon that had just arrived, his expression unreadable. "You're wearing a leather skirt with your lower body half-covered, even if our physical condition is the same, you'll catch a cold."

On the side, Veian was already wearing a silver armor that shone brightly, with a mirror-like shield floating above her. The shield reflected the snowy landscape, still shining brightly in the snowy terrain.

"Lord, this is a shameless dragon from the dragon tribe," Laksis said, mocking him.

"It's okay, I'll just make do," Zhao Xu comforted himself. "After all, you're not reliable."

"Hmph, how dare you talk to me? I can even parasitize on your legendary demon's body, isn't that good?" Laksis boasted.

"I'm not going to let go of those two demon's bodies right now," Zhao Xu said, waving his hand to gesture to his two teammates in front of him. "Let's go find treasure."

The white dragon scratched its head. "I don't know how many times I've gone down to the lake bottom, even sneaking in to pee, and there's no hidden underwater path."

Zhao Xu's expression turned ugly, but he still restrained himself. "In the mountains."

"But there's no road here," the white dragon said in surprise.

"That's not a problem for a mage. Instead, it can separate the young and the old," Zhao Xu explained.

"Agreed," Veian agreed, her gaze lingering on the white dragon.

"What are you looking at?" the white dragon said angrily. "I'm a good white dragon who will never trespass."

"Fine."

Zhao Xu interrupted, then stretched out his hand and grabbed the two of them, like a mother hen gathering her chicks.

"Instant teleportation!"

The absolute distance teleportation spell, which had a range of four rings, instantly pulled the three of them through the power of spacetime, leaving behind only a few clear footprints, which were soon covered by new snow.

White Dragon Serus felt a wave of dizziness and blurred vision after opening his eyes again, and suddenly he was filled with a sense of excitement. His eyes, which had been shrouded by the countless flashes of gold light before him, were now fixed on the dazzling treasure trove.

As he looked around, he saw that the walls were lined with treasure chests, stacked upon each other all the way to the ceiling.

Zhao Xu's target, Fleure and Mrs. Elary, were bound and gagged, with no idea that they were in a treasure trove.

Vivian sighed and examined the two women's breathing, then rummaged through their belongings. "They've probably been drugged and are in a state of unconsciousness," she said.

"Good, we'll take them away later."

Zhao Xu nodded and looked at the two women. "Why are you still standing there? I told you to go to the black market to collect the dimensional bag, didn't I?"

"What are you waiting for? Hurry up and get it!"

"That six sisters must have set up detection spells here. We need to clear it out and withdraw quickly."

As he spoke, he pressed down on the pile of treasure stones where the White Dragon was lying. The White Dragon, still struggling to break free, suddenly looked at Zhao Xu's mouth and said in a low tone: "Damn it, the wizard, damn it, the curse."

Just as he finished speaking, it seemed that Anni's lingering power was still there, and he couldn't help but lift his head to look around. Then, with his teeth clenched and tears in his eyes, he said to Zhao Xu: "You have to give me some treasure stones. After I escaped from the ancient dragon, I lost all the treasures beforehand."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Do you know what having no treasure means for a dragon? It's the same shame as King Arthur's men. You're pushing me too hard, and I won't even get a single gemstone's labor fee."

Zhao Xu hadn't even finished speaking when the white dragon had already disappeared in front of him.

At the same time, he had grabbed three or four magical weapons from the shelf and put them into his bag, diligently fulfilling the task entrusted by Zhao Xu.

As he turned back to look at the treasure and precious stones, he felt a slight discomfort.

This was far beyond what the six sisters and the Kurulze could have earned, and it was as if it was an accumulation of wealth passed down through generations of a noble family.

However, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate to start moving.

He didn't move slowly, and the treasure chest, adorned with golden filigree, was opened with a creak. The contents were poured into the dimensional bag.

The whole process went smoothly, gradually becoming a standard routine.

Turquoise, diamonds, jade, pearl, blue sapphire, and other precious stones shone with a radiant light, illuminating the treasure room and making it unnecessary to light it up.

Zhao Xu, who had lived his life outside of books, saw all the varieties of precious stones that King Arthur was famous for.

Moreover, the quantity was overwhelming.

A large diamond worth 5,000 gold coins could only be squeezed into the corner of the dimensional bag alongside a green jade worth 50 gold coins.

Even the cat's eye stones and jade worth 10 gold coins were already numb in his hand.

The treasures here were worth over tens of millions of gold coins, comparable to the treasury of a small country.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to Zhao Xu, who likes to grasp a handful of gemstones and magical materials, Vivianna is currently standing in front of an art piece, lost in thought. She even forgot that they were supposed to rescue someone and grab some riches.

In an instant, she stretched out her hand and put away the gemstone comb, gemstone necklace, antique painting, golden crown, grandmother's green gold cup, golden embroidered clothing, and jade nasal inhaler, all sorts of art pieces and antiques, into the dimensional bag. The gold coins, on the other hand, had become the most unremarkable thing in this treasure room.

"Snapping!"

Suddenly, a very light footsteps echoed behind Zhao Xu.

He was so startled that he jumped in his seat.

He had deliberately chosen this moment because he was sure that the alliance personnel were currently fighting with the six sisters and their accomplices. Even if they noticed something was amiss, they wouldn't be able to come back anytime soon.

So, when he heard the sound, it meant that the original owner had returned. However, it was too soon.

Zhao Xu's gaze swept across the room.

He had almost jumped up, but his heart slowed down.

Annie was standing behind him, smiling, but her eyes sparkled with mischief, as if she was going to play a trick on Zhao Xu.

"My master, I think these treasures might leave you," Lark said, shaking her head and sighing, as if she had hands.

"Naive, my teacher wouldn't stoop to these things," Zhao Xu replied.

"This can't be said with certainty, for women, treasure is never enough—"

Lark was about to argue, but her voice stopped suddenly.

"Summer Solstice."

Annie nodded in satisfaction, "Not bad, my disciple, you've successfully dug up a small treasure trove in your first outing."

"Oh, that's Grandpa Dragon's—" White Dragon Serus interrupted.

Only Anzuo's sharp eyes swept across, and his voice weakened slightly, "Okay, it's just a tiny bit."

The sharpness intensified.

"Okay, it's just a little bit, but it's also the sacred treasure of the dragon tribe that cannot be touched," White Dragon whispered in supplication.

"If this treasure room only belongs to the six sisters, you can get it smoothly," Anzuo reminded.

"Who is the true owner of this treasure?" Zhao Xu asked seriously.

Even if the six sisters worked for a hundred years, they wouldn't be able to accumulate so many things. Moreover, they've only been famous for ten years.

If they really had these things, they would have retired long ago and thought that no one likes a life of eating and drinking blood.

"The true owner of this treasure, Duke Carlo, is about to arrive in the next second," Anzuo said.

Even White Dragon, who was willing to risk his life for money, stopped his claws at this moment.

As the leader of the alliance's behind-the-scenes, Duke Carlo's reputation had even reached the ears of those in the icy mountain range.

The key is that Duke Carlo is said to be a legendary strong one!

His reputation was even deeper than that of the strong ones who suddenly rose to power, such as Tang De.

Zhao Xu felt his scalp tingling, and he almost wanted to shout "Hurry up!" if Anzuo weren't standing in front of him.

To get the treasure, the premise is that you must have the strength to take it.

"Xia, do you plan to use some of these treasures as collateral to get a legendary mage to help us?" Anzuo suddenly looked at Zhao Xu with an expectant expression.

"I guarantee that the remaining wealth will not hinder your rise to become the first player," Anzuo said.
