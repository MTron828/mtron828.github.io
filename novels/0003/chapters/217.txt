Chapter 218: The Three-Ring Mage

After Zhao Xü asked about the barkeeper's information, he immediately came upstairs to the VIP room. It was because he was clear that the other party was a player. Initially, he had found Kaiser, the underground leader, in Fierce Wind City when he was looking for a smuggling group to leave the city. He had deliberately shown his mage identity to the other party. Because he knew that unless he used the three-ring method, he would be no match for others.

So, his mage identity became his shield. And coming upstairs, his player identity became his shield as well. However, he didn't expect that Wolan had already taken control of the city for over a month, relying on his personal entrepreneurship rather than level. He had even seen Wolan buying and selling equipment, even stealing gear, without any hesitation.

It was as if the gods had not yet died, and evil behavior was not yet at a level where it could be openly practiced. Suddenly, Zhao Xü realized something. Perhaps his mage robes had made people underestimate him. Even though he was carrying a mysterious giant scythe, his behavior of not wearing armor directly indicated that he was not a warrior.

Currently, in the mage community of Arthur, there was only one 4th-level mage and four 2nd-level mages, nicknamed "One God and Four Kings" by forum players. It sounded very impressive but also implied that most other mages were actually 1st-level novices. Meanwhile, most basic professions had already enriched their 2nd-level teams.

However, Zhao Xü was also helpless. He had come here to seek intelligence support, not to kill anyone.
Here is the translation of the text:

These players may have a few magical weapons, which means that only the person wielding the magical weapon can pose a threat to Zhao Xu. The opponent has naturally become Zhao Xu's main target.

Others wielding ordinary weapons try to attack Zhao Xu, but they will only be destroyed by his cloak.

Just as Zhao Xu thought, the guards initially responsible for guarding the entrance, a few Arthurian native guards, began to surround Zhao Xu.

Even the young man sitting on the sofa pulled out a handheld crossbow and aimed it at Zhao Xu.

Arthur's freedom has given players too many possibilities.

It has also led some players to suddenly rise to prominence due to their good impression of the NPC, while also causing discord.

"You're sure you want to fight me?" Zhao Xu smiled as he looked at the people in front of him.

He was assessing whether he should take action and control the scope.

"Idiot. Give up those two pieces of equipment and I'll let you off with a warning. Otherwise, we'll block you outside the temple and kill you five times, and by then, your talent points will be gone, okay?" said the young man with the crossbow.

He had already made up his mind that the opponent would surrender the equipment.

Arthur's death penalty was so severe that everyone found it unbearable, and naturally became a powerful deterrent.

Initially, this group of people could smoothly enter the Star Lake Mine Association, but it was not because they had accumulated the first batch of capital by robbing players and Arthur residents.

They had never done such a reckless business before.

But this novice player had somehow obtained two magical equipment, directly triggering their greed.

Or, after the player removed the equipment, he took the first step back.
Here is the translation of the text:

They were about to start the second phase of acquiring equipment. The thousands of gold coins' exchange token, Vola had put on the table many times before, but no one had ever been able to easily take it away. As long as the other party agreed to withdraw from the first step, it would be a start for them to manipulate. Since they were familiar with this behavior, they began to enter their respective roles when Vola revealed a hunting-like expression. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was estimating his own anger value.

He had to decide when he couldn't take it anymore and directly clear the scene. Before that, he had to ask, so that these people wouldn't die unclearly. "Are you treating someone who has just asked for information like this?" Zhao Xu asked with a smile.

"It's quite calm, much better than the last time when we directly disconnected," said the woman sitting at the edge with a smile. She was still wearing the robe of a novice cleric, with the mark of the god of fury on her robe.

Listening to the other party's words, Zhao Xu could only express his sorrow without any words. Forcing himself to disconnect would only cause his body to become as numb as death.

The "hand skills" of the "natural wanderer" could take effect and steal the player's equipment.

"Alright, we've accomplished something, and you can take the equipment and the bag of gold," Vola continued to say in an icy tone, but on the other side, she was still dismantling Zhao Xu's psychological defense.

First, they would lower the price to the limit, and then slightly raise it, making the other party feel like it was a favor. However, they encountered someone who looked at them like they were fools.
Here is the translation of the text:

This feeling that was completely opposite to what was expected, made everyone in the room feel that this time they were facing a different person. It wasn't as easy as they had anticipated. Suddenly, the young man holding the crossbow directly pulled the trigger, and a "arrow" shot straight at Zhao Xu flying towards him. The young man also revealed a ruthless smile. When someone tried to delay, they naturally had to speed up the pace. So, they had already detailed the steps at the beginning. If the opponent refused to surrender, they would have to use brutal methods to make them suffer before saying anything. A weakened state was more likely to break one's will. The young man was extremely confident, with a success rate of about 90% in hitting his targets, so he aimed directly at Zhao Xu, even when Zhao Xu was being escorted by four bodyguards with weapons. However, just as the arrow was about to pierce Zhao Xu's body, a sudden downpour of starlight poured down from the sky. The originally unbreakable arrow shaft was directly shattered and destroyed by the starlight. Even in this intense starlight, a rain of arrows spread out, still having no effect. Before everyone could react to what was happening, a loud voice shouted out. "Flash Smoke!" The last impression left on everyone was the name of this spell. This was even more intense than the initial starlight, and directly exploded into a golden dust cloud, spreading throughout the auditorium. "Ah!" "My eyes! How can I not see?" "Don't get excited!" "It's blindness, don't panic." "Flash Smoke" is a strong blinding spell in the second circle of magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

It creates a dazzling golden particle that floats in mid-air, and most living beings that are enveloped by it will emit a golden glow and be unable to hide, even if they are invisible. The spell resistance has no effect on it, and only a will save can determine whether one will fall into a state of blindness.

As for everyone's eyes recover, the entire room is filled with a golden glow, and everyone's bodies are covered with the particles created by the spell. However, their target, Zhao Xu, has disappeared after casting the spell.

The entire process is incredibly fast, and it's as if everyone is unable to react. Their plan has been disrupted.

"Let's retreat," said the leader of the players, Wulan, with a tense expression, as she had already realized that they had just kicked over a hornet's nest.

"What's going on?" said the girl in the corner, looking around nervously.

Although she also feels that something is off, she still has a lingering sense of unease.

From the moment the spell was cast, the door to the room has not been opened. However, there is no trace of Zhao Xu's whereabouts, and it's impossible to hide with the effects of the "Flash Dust" spell.

The only reason is that the opponent has used a "hide" spell.

Even the young people who are familiar with the "Flash Dust" and "Hide" spells have a sense of unease, as if they have been hit by a steel plate.

"The sooner we run, the better," said the oldest of the five men, gritting his teeth.

They look down on the ring wizard, as they think the method is limited.

However, the situation has clearly reversed. It is obvious that the opponent is a high-level ring wizard who is intentionally toying with them.
Here is the translation of the text:

The other person should be a native wizard; I must have misjudged. Wolar said to himself, as a group of people began to gather at the entrance.

Everyone was aware that there was still one person hiding in the room, waiting to reap their lives. However, no one dared to speak out the truth.

Just as the guard was hesitantly inserting the key into the lock, a sudden death announcement echoed from behind: "Fireball!"

The bar at "Micro Wine" was already bustling with activity, and some lucky gamblers were already placing their bets on the young man who had just descended from the second floor, carrying a massive scythe. However, the majority of gamblers were betting that the young man would not be able to take another step.

Just as they were about to clink their cups and wait for the next bet to come in, a loud explosion shook the room, accompanied by the sound of various objects crashing to the ground.

The shockwave from the explosion made everyone feel like the ground and the cups were shaking.

They all stared blankly at the package room on the second floor, which was now deserted.

Was it possible that the second floor was hiding some kind of explosive device?

The guards on the first floor, who had been watching the situation, were about to rush upstairs.

However, their path was blocked.

A man with a hooded cloak and a scythe appeared from the corner of the second floor, walking slowly down the stairs.

Throughout the process, he moved at a slow pace, but no one dared to call out to stop him, as if he were the embodiment of death.

The bartender, who had been watching the man since the beginning, knelt down in fear, unable to move, fearing that he would attract attention.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't until the mage officially left the tavern that the few guards gathered the courage to go up to the second floor.

Immediately, the guards' screams echoed through the air:

"Dead, finished, they're all dead."
In that instant, the entire tavern became alert, even the most intoxicated drunkards snapped back to attention.

They were well aware of the forces upstairs, which could easily sweep aside the dozens of people on the first floor.
At this moment, they thought about the faint sulfur smell in the air and the loud boom that followed.
A tavern-goer who had once been an apprentice to a half-year mage looked at them with reverence and admiration, saying:

"Fireball spell."
"That's a three-ring mage!"
