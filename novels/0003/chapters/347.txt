Chapter 348: Eradicate Disease

At this moment, another player beside Zheng Xin Yun shook his head and said, "We just arrived in this alley to purchase supplies, and who knew this woman would suddenly faint."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile wryly, but in the game, players could be so reckless and help the fainted person.

"What's the problem?" Zhao Xu asked directly.

Most of the novice priest players around him heard this question and knew it was a test from the non-playable character (NPC), but they looked embarrassed and didn't know how to respond.

The "healing" skill, as a powerful supplementary means for priest healing spells, was a popular skill among players. Like a church, training courses were held to introduce common diseases and treatment methods, as well as how to handle wounds and pain.

So, Zhao Xu's question was also exposing the novice priest players' training on the healing skill, which was just going through the motions.

Even Zhao Xu, an outsider, could diagnose the disease that the fainted woman was infected with based on his knowledge and skills.

"It's demonic fever, also known as hot demon disease," Zheng Xin Yun said, putting down the woman's wrist and added, "It should be this disease."

Her eyes also shone with confidence, making the people around her look uneasy.

"How do you say?" Zhao Xu smiled and asked, as if a teacher questioning a student.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin Yu was wearing loose robes, completely covering her figure. After hearing Zhao Xu's question, she slightly furrowed her brow and thought for a moment, "From the woman's attire, I can infer that she is not from a very poor family, not someone who is struggling to make ends meet. However, she is extremely thin and gaunt, almost to the point of being skeletal, so I infer that her physical quality has been affected."

"Furthermore, there is a tooth mark on her wrist, the wound is red and swollen, and I can feel a burning sensation at times. Combining this with my previous training, I believe she has 'hot fever disease'."

"What a great job, Xin Yu!" At this moment, the women walking alongside Zheng Xin Yu all couldn't help but applaud.

Zhao Xu also smiled wistfully.

Before Zheng Xin Yu married Zhao Xu, she had received training as a novice pastor, and her medical skills were almost at the level of a 4th-level pastor.

Unfortunately, after crossing over, becoming a pastor was much more difficult than expected, and Zheng Xin Yu ultimately failed to open the door to faith, and became a regular pastor.

If not, Zhao Xu would have easily broken through to a new level, directly escaping Zheng Xin Yu's level.

However, Zheng Xin Yu looked worried, "I'm afraid we can't save her. Moreover, her symptoms may have already reached a critical point and can't be delayed any further."

Zhao Xu agreed, "That's right, the incubation period of hot fever disease is one day, and it will break out every day. It's difficult to get rid of it, and the physical quality will be reduced by 1-6 points. If you can't get rid of it, it will continue to reduce your physical quality every day."

The reduction of attributes is divided into two categories, "attribute damage" and "attribute absorption". The attribute damage is the negative effect of "overwhelming grasp" suffered by Zhao Xu, which can be restored through rest or magic, with 1 point restored per day. However, attribute absorption is permanent.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, this woman has been injured, her own resilience has decreased, and it's even more impossible to pass through. Won't she eventually become zeroed out like this? At that moment, a clear-skinned female player who was standing couldn't help but cover her mouth and look at the middle-aged woman who had fallen to the ground with a sympathetic expression.

The people present were all taken aback, their faces uncertain. If most attributes become zero, it means they're in a helpless state, and may even fall into a coma. Only the physical attribute, once it becomes zero, means death.

"Mr. Priest, can you save her?" a burly man who was standing a little further away asked, but just as he opened his mouth, someone next to him shook him off, signaling him to be quiet.

The onlookers from Mistral, including Zheng Xin'an, were all silently watching the scene, and no one dared to urge Zhao Xu to intervene.

"How's this?" asked "Fu Feng," a male player who had joined the game just a few days ago, his tone filled with bewilderment. Everyone's expression was very serious.

After a long time, someone finally spoke up: "Let's take her to the hospital to find a doctor to rescue her."

"It's already reached the point of coma, and even general doctors' medical skills may not be effective. And even if we can rescue her, it's impossible to recover the lost physical attributes. This must be the first time it's happened. She must have either sought medical treatment before or can't afford the medical expenses. She's unable to afford the cost of treatment."

Suddenly, the novice priest Fu Feng looked at Zhao Xu with a deep frown, his eyes filled with strange emotions. "Teacher, why are the residents around us not requesting your help for this pitiful woman?" he asked.

Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't answer."
At this moment, Zheng Xin'an also let out a sigh, "You'll understand when you come into contact with divine training in two days."

"In towns with churches, no one is allowed to kidnap a pastor to save a patient. All diseases that require divine healing treatment should be sent to the church, in accordance with the severity of the illness and the level of devotion and contribution. Therefore, unless it's an outdoor adventure or a scheduled pastor, no one will intentionally prepare divine healing."

Zhao Xu looked at the male player, Fang, who was a bit hard to understand, knowing that this was different from his previous thoughts.

In fact, from the first day, when the opponent came into contact with the teachings of God, he knew that the church of the goddess was a guide to good deeds, and the pastors he saw were indeed doing so.

This made the originally irreligious Fang in the real world actually believe in the magic goddess in the game.

Because Arthur's god and pastors are consistent in their words and actions.

However, looking at the scene that should be rescued, from the pastors in front of him to the bystanders watching, it seemed that they were all different from what he thought.

The people around him saw that Fang seemed not to understand and couldn't help but lightly kick him and say, "If you're going to save everyone, then you'll never be able to prepare other divine healing."

Although it was harsh, it was also very realistic.

Arthur's patients were completely unsaveable, and even more so when including those who were injured and waiting for treatment, which was a astronomical number.

This was also the reason why the church issued a special decree, requiring all medical rescue for ordinary people to be arranged by the church.

And no one in the scene asked Zhao Xu to display his divine healing, because he was not scheduled to rescue patients, so he would not prepare the corresponding divine healing.
Here is the translation:

"Come on, let's take this woman to the hospital first," Zheng Xinan suddenly said. "Her medical expenses will be paid by me. Depending on the diagnosis, we'll see if we need to send her to the church for treatment."

As soon as he spoke, everyone's mood turned somber.

They knew that sending her to the hospital would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause, and the daily physical exhaustion would also be a heavy burden for these novice pastors.

As for the woman, she might not be lucky enough to be prioritized on the church's rescue list.

"I'll split the cost with you," Bufeng also bit his teeth and said. Today's scene had taught him a lesson, making him realize his own helplessness.

Zhao Xu looked at Zheng Xinan as he was about to help the middle-aged woman get up, but then lightly lifted his hand to signal for her to stop.

"Ah?" Zheng Xinan couldn't help but feel a surge of joy when he saw Zhao Xu's gesture, although they didn't have much interaction with each other.

However, Zheng Xinan had already seen his abilities on the first day he entered the game and knew that Zhao Xu's position was not as simple as just a novice pastor.

If Zhao Xu were to speak up, the middle-aged woman they had encountered would definitely be saved.

However, Zhao Xu simply pointed to the distance and said, "Say, you two don't know her, so why are you willing to pay for her treatment? And besides, isn't there countless innocent people suffering from illnesses waiting to be saved?"

As he spoke, Zhao Xu pointed to the distant slum, where there were many homeless people lying on the ground, many of whom had malignant sores and were waiting to die. "Why can't you save them instead?" he asked.

However, Zheng Xinan simply shook his head and said, "I don't know why, but there are indeed many pitiful people in the world."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't know, but if I did encounter it, it means I need to stretch out my hand, otherwise I wouldn't qualify to be a pastor."

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded, seemingly confirming that Zheng Xin'an's moral values had always been like this, even after experiencing the turbulent journey of crossing dimensions.

"Let her go," Zhao Xu said.

"Huh?" Zheng Xin'an's face was bewildered, almost losing his balance as the middle-aged woman who had almost fainted.

"This way I can save her," Zhao Xu said with a smile, and then he directly waved his hand, completing the incantation and gesture of magic, and suddenly grasping a ball of soft energy in his palm.

He directly attached the ball to the wound on the woman's body, injecting energy into it.

"Remove the disease, three-ring divine art," Zhao Xu said, looking at the group of novice pastors in front of him.

"Remember, as long as you have the ability, you can save whoever you want to save."
