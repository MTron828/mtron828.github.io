Chapter 561: I Am the Organization

"Teacher, it's been a long time," said Zhao Xu with a heart-to-heart connection to communicate with his teacher, An Ti Nya.

As soon as he finished speaking, An Ti Nya's body suddenly appeared beside him, having instantaneously pinpointed his location.

"You're in a precarious state," An Ti Nya raised an eyebrow slightly.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu asked with some curiosity.

At this moment, the two of them were standing on a hillside, with a panoramic view. They were also being observed by nearby Earth travelers. However, no one dared to approach them, as in the eyes of these people, Zhao Xu and An Ti Nya, who had appeared out of thin air, were not too different from the mythical immortals of legend.

However, this attention had no impact on the two of them. Zhao Xu, who had traveled through four or five regions in a short span of hours, had already seen countless people's astonished, admiring, resentful, and envious gazes, and was completely unbothered by it.

"You've forgotten that humans have lost all protection for their spiritual abilities?" An Ti Nya said softly.

As for the crowd of onlookers below, especially the players, they couldn't help but speculate about the mysterious communication between the two seemingly familiar wizards. Even the gatekeepers represented the two as being above the level of four-ring wizards.

After solving the basic security issues, the Earth travelers also began to urgently seek information about everything related to Arthur in this one-day period.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Inside "the most crucial and critical" is the entire adventurer occupation system and monster system. For example, people like Zhao Xu and An Xinyue who don't wear armor are actually mages and clerics. A warrior and an ordinary civilian who wear armor might not look out of the ordinary at first, but a spellcaster's "spell" becomes extremely different after a real full-scale invasion. Players also begin to realize that in the entire wilderness, they can cultivate ordinary civilians into warriors, rangers, and rogues. However, the profession of a spellcaster is one that cannot be replicated by human power.

Zhao Xu silently pondered this word.

He had already enjoyed the great power of mind control magic.

Before he went to search for his parents, he could easily manipulate the minds of others, even if they resisted, and make them stop harming each other.

But players before the crossing didn't think like this. On one hand, mind control magic couldn't affect players who were under protection. On the other hand, mind control magic was often targeted at humanoid monsters, so most monsters didn't eat. As a result, mind control magic became a neglected spell among mages, and some mages even deliberately abandoned it to focus on a specific school of thought.

"You mean I also have the possibility of being controlled?" Zhao Xu said with a hint of doubt.

"No, it's true," said the guide. "Some courses taught by the association intentionally use rituals and various complex encryption methods to prevent high-level mages from reading memories or controlling minds under the effects of such spells and leaking information."
Here is the translation of the text:

Anastasia summarized, "Therefore, I will find an artifact for you to carry, and after you reach the eighth circle, you can cast your mind shield on your own, but you are not allowed to take it off until then."

She finished speaking and filled in a crucial gap for Zhao Xu.

"There's something else you know, the entire Aridia has already had over a hundred forces infiltrate the barren wasteland."

Anastasia slightly tilted her head and gazed at the plain covered with weeds below the hill.

"However, the Magic Goddess convinced the other gods, so she promised you that as long as you can control the scope, that is Aridia, that is your territory."

"So now your guild has a radius of a thousand miles, and it's estimated that it's in a state of vacuum, and the goddess's priest will come to assist you."

Zhao Xu's eyebrows furrowed slightly when he heard this.

These forces are also quite realistic, and it's possible to rescue people within the scope.

"Hmm, so Zongxia, you still have a heavy responsibility now, and the fate of billions of people's lives hangs on your shoulders."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu sighed, "According to my spellcaster level, even if I don't stop cultivating for 24 hours, I can produce 20 million tons of food for a day."

An astonishing data fell from Zhao Xu's mouth, but it sounded so ordinary.

If the people who were hungry and waiting below heard this, they would definitely shout something ridiculous.

Because at this moment, many people who had crossed over had started to show off their old skills, digging up wild vegetables in the ground. This skill that was previously stigmatized had suddenly become the most sought-after non-professional ability.

However, these wild vegetables that had been infected with negative energy were already withered and limp, and they couldn't even lift their heads, let alone the slight toxicity.
Here is the translation of the text:

If one doesn't go through the "purification of food" performed by the pastor, ordinary people who eat it may be able to fill their stomachs, but they will also easily accumulate toxins. It's equivalent to pushing the time of death a little further back.

Thinking this way, Zhao Xu gazed at An Tiya.

In other words, according to An Tiya, who has exceeded level 70 in terms of spellcasting, if he doesn't develop new war magic, the daily food production would increase by 40 million times, sufficient to feed the entire population of 4 billion people.

Adding them up, it would account for less than 1% of the total human population. It's like pouring water into a dry well.

"So, I'm asking you a question now."

As An Tiya spoke, she gazed at Zhao Xu.

"Are you willing to let Yanna become a member of the Association of Wizards in exchange for the full support of Misteria?"

An Tiya's tone was nonchalant, as if it didn't concern her.

"I've already joined the Magic Guardian Organization, so matters related to the Association of Wizards are naturally my business. I accept this point."

Zhao Xu had once suspected this moment, because it was the same situation faced by the previous king, Qing Wei.

"How can you agree so easily?"

An Tiya was surprised.

"You see, just like when the Eastern Empire was founded, they refused the Association of Wizards' help to ensure the purity of the Nine Swords. This also earned the Eastern Empire its independence and freedom from interference. The decision made by the thirteen clans behind the scenes is what the Eastern Empire has decided."

Zhao Xu shook his head, "I don't have such an indispensable thought."

As he spoke, he looked at the earth-crossing people below, among whom there were many who had once been upper-class.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entrepreneurs who have successfully passed the review and are about to reap the rewards of their hard work are also officials who have graduated from prestigious schools and have a strong background in policy-making. There are also those who have leveraged the golden age of the internet to achieve financial freedom. At this moment, they are all about to rewrite their life stories, relying only on their previous interpersonal relationships and the "professional opportunities" that match their skills.

"So, I won't think about it if I don't get it. I'd rather let everything be destroyed," said Zhao Xu with a hint of disappointment.

"If the person who comes today is another high-ranking official from the Floating City, even one of the Seven Titans, I'll hesitate," Zhao Xu said with a sense of uncertainty.

"However, if it's you, my mentor, I won't have any doubts," Zhao Xu said with a tinge of nostalgia.

"That sounds good," said An Ti No Ya with a fleeting smile.

"But you have already completely transcended and become a part of this world. I didn't see you send me a message or communicate with me," An Ti No Ya said with a hint of skepticism.

At this point, Zhao Xu had already become frustrated and said, "Mentor, when you were in the ninth circle of hell, I would occasionally send you messages and communicate with you."

"However, you told me that the failure rate of sending messages to the other side is 5%, but some special places have a much higher failure rate. After repeated failures, I would often wait for your mentor to come and find me," Zhao Xu said with a hint of frustration.

An Ti No Ya shook her head and said, "Hmph, I was taking a big risk by crossing over and even mocked you once. Isn't that right?"

"That's why I'm grateful to you, mentor," Zhao Xu said with a hint of resentment.

At that moment, the cold, mechanical voice announced that as of the summer solstice, all players' abilities would be able to enter the realm of Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text:

Behind her, Anzhiya's soft voice suddenly appeared again, mentioning his name once more, which was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the conversation. It was obvious that Anzhiya had suddenly thought of this.

"Alright, I won't argue with you. You don't have to worry. Accept Mr. Mistral's help, and he won't let your territory lose its independence," Anzhiya said.

"This is not my territory, it's the territory of humanity on Earth. I was just standing on the peak," Zhao Xu corrected.

"Do you believe me?" Anzhiya chuckled lightly, "Or should I ask the people below whether they believe it?"

"I believe you," Zhao Xu replied calmly.

"However, I should tell you that from the moment you agreed, Mr. Mistral has already started to transport wizards to Yanan, and he will sign a food loan agreement with Wang Qingwei," Anzhiya said.

"However, the entire sanctuary of Yanan is certainly capable of planting food earlier than other territories, achieving self-sufficiency, and the association will also lend a helping hand. It's not like sending someone in the snow,"

"What I'm going to do next is like sending someone in the snow," Anzhiya said with a hint of pride.

"Yes, it's the treasure trove you mentioned just now?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.

"But isn't the treasure trove your teacher's own, not something the association gave you?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No, summer," Anzhiya said, shaking her head and wiggling her fingers, which made Zhao Xu's heart flutter.

"My teacher, originally, I divided into two parts. The part representing magic, which is what the wizard's association gave me, is that fake treasure trove, just a deception to cover up the true purpose of this organization."

"I am the organization."
