Chapter 561: I am the Organization

"Teacher, it's been a long time," said Zhao Xu, linking his heart and mind with his teacher, An Ti Noya.

As soon as he finished speaking, An Ti Noya's body suddenly appeared beside Zhao Xu, as if she had instantly located his existence.

"You're not safe at all," An Ti Noya frowned slightly.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu asked, slightly puzzled.

At this moment, the two of them appeared on a hillside, with a clear view of the surroundings.

Naturally, they were also being gazed at by the earth-crossing people nearby. However, no one dared to approach them, as in the eyes of these people, Zhao Xu and An Ti Noya, who had suddenly appeared, were not much different from the legendary immortal beings of myths.

However, this attention had no impact on the two of them, and they didn't care at all.

Zhao Xu, who had traversed four or five regions in a single day, had already seen countless people's shocked, admiring, resentful, and envious gazes in a short span of hours. He was no longer surprised by this.

"You forgot that humans have lost all their spiritual abilities?" An Ti Noya said softly.

Meanwhile, the crowd of onlookers, especially the players, couldn't help but speculate about what was going on between these two seemingly acquainted wizards.

Even the threshold of the unknown represented that the two were above the four-ring wizard level.

After solving the basic security issues, the earth-crossing people began to urgently need to know everything about Arther.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Inside the phrase "重中之重" is the entire adventurer profession system and monster system. For example, people like Zhao Xu and An Ningya who don't wear armor are like mages and sorcerers. A warrior or a normal civilian who wears armor might not seem out of the ordinary at first glance. However, the "spell" of a mage in a real-world setting has become an extremely unusual "existence". Players began to realize that in the entire wilderness, they can cultivate ordinary civilians into warriors, rangers, and wanderers. However, the mage profession is one that cannot be replicated by human power.

Zhao Xu also silently pondered this word.

He had already enjoyed the immense power of the mind control spell.

Before he went to find his parents, even if he encountered any obstacles, he could easily control the minds of others, stopping conflicts and establishing harmony.

However, players before the crossover didn't think like this. On one hand, the mind control spell couldn't affect protected players. On the other hand, the mind control spell was mainly targeted at humanoid monsters, so most monsters didn't eat. As a result, the mind control spell became a cold spell in the eyes of mage players, and some mages even directly opposed the mind control spell to specialize in a particular school of thought.

"Teacher, do you mean that I also have the possibility of being controlled?" Zhao Xu said with a hint of doubt.

"No, it's true. Some instructors deliberately use rituals and various complex encryption methods to avoid revealing their memories or controlling minds under the influence of high-level mage spells."
Here is the translation of the text:

Annie summarized, "Therefore, I will find an item to bring to you. Until you reach level 8 and can cast the Heart Barrier on your own, you are not allowed to take it off."

She spoke briefly and filled in a crucial gap for Zhao Xuemi.

"By the way, do you know that more than a hundred forces have infiltrated the entire Wasteland of the Wild?"

Annie raised her head slightly and gazed at the barren plain below.

"The Goddess of Magic has persuaded the other gods, so she has promised you that within the range you can control, it is your territory."

"So, now your association has a range of thousands of miles, and it is likely to be in a state of vacuum. The goddess's shepherd will come to assist you."

Zhao Xuemi's eyebrows furrowed as he listened.

These forces are also quite realistic, and it's possible to rescue people within a certain range.

"Hmph, so, in the summer, your responsibility is still very heavy, oh, with the lives of several billion people hanging in the balance on your shoulders."

Zhao Xuemi sighed as he listened.

According to my mage level, even if I don't stop cultivating for 24 hours, it's equivalent to producing 200 million people's food supply in a day."

A staggering data emerged from Zhao Xuemi's mouth, but he spoke in a tone that was surprisingly flat.

If the crowd of people who were still hungry heard this, they would probably shout something outrageous.

Because at this moment, many travelers who had crossed over were already engaging in agriculture, starting to dig up underground wild vegetables. This skill that was previously disdained due to its negative energy contamination had suddenly become the most sought-after non-professional ability.

However, these wild vegetables that had been contaminated with negative energy were already weakened, and their heads barely lifted.
Here is the translation of the text:

If ordinary people eat food that has not been "purified" by a priest's magic, they can barely fill their stomachs, but they may also accumulate toxins. It's as if they are inadvertently shortening their lifespan by a few hours.

Zhao Xu gazed at An Ti Nia, thinking that if An Ti Nia, who had surpassed the 70th level of magic, did not develop new war magic, the daily food production would increase by 40 million times, enough to feed the entire human population. However, this would be equivalent to a drop in the ocean.

"So, I'm going to ask you one question," An Ti Nia said, looking at Zhao Xu with a nonchalant tone, as if it didn't concern her.

"Do you agree to let Yana become a member of the Mage Association, in exchange for the full support of Mistral?" An Ti Nia asked.

Zhao Xu, who had already joined the Mage Guard, replied, "Of course, I accept. After all, the affairs of the Mage Association are my concern."

Zhao Xu had previously suspected that this moment was similar to the situation King Qing Wei had faced in his past life.

"How easily you agreed," An Ti Nia said, looking surprised.

"You should know that when the Eastern Empire was established, they refused all aid from the Mage Association to ensure the purity of the Nine Swords. This also secured the empire's independence and prevented any interference. The 13 great clans behind the scenes decided the fate of the East," Zhao Xu explained.

Zhao Xu shook his head, "I don't have such an indispensable thought."

As he spoke, he gazed at the people from the lower classes, including those who had once been from the upper class.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entrepreneurs who have successfully gone through the review process are just about to reap the rewards of their hard work, and there are also government officials who have benefited from their connections and experience. However, as they stand before them, they are all about to rewrite their lives, relying only on their previous relationships and the "career opportunities" that fit their personalities.

"So I won't even think about it if I don't get it," said Zhao Xu, his hands behind his back. "Even if the person who comes today is a high-ranking official from the Floating City, or one of the Seven Giants, I'll hesitate."

"Just you, my teacher, I won't doubt," Zhao Xu sighed.

"That sounds good," said Anne Noyah, her face suddenly blooming like a peach flower in April, but her inner reserve made her turn slightly to the side.

"But you've already completely crossed over and become a part of this world, and I haven't seen you send me a message or communicate with me," she said.

At this point, Zhao Xu had already become flustered: "Teacher, when you were in the ninth layer of hell, I would occasionally send you messages and communicate with you."

"Just that you told me that even though the success rate of sending messages to the other side is 5%, some special places have a significantly increased failure rate. After failing multiple times, I've been waiting for you to come find me."

Anne Noyah shook her head, laughing. "Ha ha, I was just joking when I mocked you at the beginning of the crossover, okay?"

"That's why I'm really grateful to you, teacher," Zhao Xu said, his tone slightly resentful.

At that moment, the cold, mechanical voice announced that from the summer solstice on, all players' abilities could be inherited in Arthur's world.

Behind her, Anzhiya's feminine voice suddenly appeared again, mentioning his name once more, which was completely unnecessary and just added to the commotion, causing a massive amount of attention to be drawn to him.

It was clear that Anzhiya had suddenly had a change of heart.

"Alright, I won't bother arguing with you. Just rest assured that Mistral will help you, and your territory won't lose its independence," Anzhiya said.

"This isn't my territory; it's the territory of human beings on Earth. I'm just temporarily standing at the peak," Zhao Xu corrected.

"Do you believe me?" Anzhiya chuckled lightly. "Or ask the people below whether they believe me or not."

"I believe you," Zhao Xu said calmly.

"However, I should tell you that from the moment you agreed, Mistral has already begun to transport mages to Yanan, and will sign a grain loan agreement with Wang Congwei," Anzhiya said.

"However, the entire sanctuary of Yanan is certainly able to cultivate grain earlier than other territories, and achieve self-sufficiency. The association will also lend a helping hand, which is like sending someone a warm blanket in the snow. It's not a small favor," Anzhiya said.

"That's what I'm going to do next. It's like sending someone a warm blanket in the snow," Anzhiya said with a hint of pride.

"Yes, it's just what you said, the treasure?" Zhao Xu exclaimed in surprise.

"Wait, but the treasure isn't yours, is it? It's not something the association gave to you," Zhao Xu said in surprise.

"No, Summer," Anzhiya said, shaking her head slightly and waving her fingers in a slow, seductive motion, sending a shiver down Zhao Xu's spine.

"My teacher, when we first divided, the part that represented magic was given to me by the association, which included that fake treasure. It was all just a ruse to distract from the true key to the organization," Anzhiya said.

"I am the organization."
