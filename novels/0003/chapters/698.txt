Chapter 699, 11th grade

When he heard these words, Zhao Xu's mind relaxed a bit.

The demon lord who could speak reason was a good demon lord, unlike some low-IQ monsters that were born to die.

At this moment, he had forgotten how he had almost been beaten to death by someone just now.

It was also strange that he was too reckless.

As he saw the Heavenly Mountain attacking the Abyss, he thought he had an opportunity to make a big splash, and without hesitation, he unleashed his magical and melee attacks, killing two Balroth demons.

But little did he know that one of them was a big shot, and he didn't know if it was a boyfriend or a husband, and the Abyss Lord was so excited that he chased him for tens of millions of kilometers.

Is it really true that supernatural abilities have no limits?

Aren't these Abyss demon lords, all biting each other, big shots of opposing camps, right?

Why didn't they come to lend a hand?

Zhao Xu was thinking deeply in his heart.

"Yes?" The voice in the void continued to ask, "What's wrong, don't you dare to answer?"

"No."

As he saw the vast, green-golden palm that was more powerful than the "Bijia Bi Fashen" palm art, he really didn't dare to take the initiative, fearing that he would be mercilessly killed.

"Not me, I'm just a bit strange."

Zhao Xu explained.

"Oh?"

It seemed that this Abyss Lord was interested and asked, "Perhaps I can guide you, a lost traveler like you."

Thanks, but no need.

Zhao Xu's heart was sensitive, and he directly refused.

If he had listened, he would have probably died on the spot.

A demon lord's "suggestion" - who would be foolish enough to listen?
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xu's micro-expression of a smile, he deliberately maintained his usual calm and gentle demeanor, not revealing his inner trembling to the other party.

"I'm strange, I've been entrusted with the task of staying in the depths of the abyss, doing nothing reckless, and being a normal wizard," he said.

"But when I see those demons appearing, I just can't help but go up and harvest their lives."

"And when Balrogs appear, although they are attacking angels and slaughtering many heavenly creatures," he continued.

"But according to my true instincts, I won't do it secretly either, and I won't do it so openly and brazenly."

At this moment, Zhao Xu didn't know why he was analyzing his recent behavior bit by bit, and more importantly, he was introducing this lord of the abyss one by one.

He was about to write a letter titled "My Struggle", but corrected himself to say "My Confession".

"Ah ha."

In this narrow tunnel, hundreds of shadowy figures, constantly exchanging positions and making it difficult to capture their positions, disappeared one by one, as if releasing the benevolent intention of this lord of the abyss.

Suddenly, a whirlpool of swirling space appeared before him, like a dragon's whirlwind.

"Transmission?"

"Is the demon lord himself?"

Don't bother giving face?

Zhao Xu muttered to himself as he prepared to move his legs, trying to escape to the end of the world.

But on the other hand, he thought that he might need to use the methods of connecting with Anziliya.

Although they had parted ways not long ago, he felt a bit embarrassed.

But Zhao Xu thought of Anziliya's initial urgent look, and it seemed that there were still important things to attend to, so he didn't want to disturb the other party.

He could only continue to pretend to be friendly with this lord of the abyss.
Here is the translation of the text:

Slowly, as the whirlpool's rotation speed becomes more tranquil, this whirlpool takes on the appearance of a grotesque and demonic face with sharp angles.

Knowledge (plane), knowledge (religion), knowledge (mystery)... Zhaoxu one by one activates his knowledge search for the current appearance of this demonic figure.

However, the result is nothing but a blank slate.

Ugh.

Another shameless demonic leader who doesn't even bother to reveal his true form to humans.

After finishing his tirade, Zhaoxu's face is filled with anticipation, "I am eagerly waiting for your guidance from the great you."

As he finishes speaking, Zhaoxu can't help but turn his head to gaze at the surrounding cliffs.

This pause is also deliberately chosen, avoiding other demonic strongholds, fortresses, and outposts.

He doesn't want anyone to see his questionable past.

"It's simple. Think about where you are now and you'll know," the demonic leader says, directly pointing out the key point.

Zhaoxu's eyebrows furrow in response, his heart filled with a sense of unease.

He further inquires, "Why? I remember that the Abyssal Plane won't actively influence the intentions of those who enter."

If the Abyssal Plane is truly so shameless, directly manipulating the battlefield, then they wouldn't even need to fight - they could simply declare this place the final stronghold of demons.

No one can resist the will of a plane.
Those angels who travel from heaven to reach the Abyssal Plane, infuriated by the plane's will, can strip the space of its transmission ability, even imprisoning them permanently - it's child's play.

According to the mysterious demonic leader, the Abyssal Plane has influenced his will, and Zhaoxu's thoughts are filled with absurdities.

"Huh?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The vast, eerie, and grotesque face of the void shook its head helplessly, saying, "It's easy to deceive the ignorant with lies, but the truth is that no one believes it." 

"Young wizard, have you never heard the phrase?"

"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."

"Do you think it's the abyss that's influencing you? Or is it the chaotic factor within you that's affecting your thought process?"

This phrase struck Zhao Xuyu like a bolt of lightning.

Suddenly, Zhao Xuyu's expression turned pale.

Each person cannot betray their own social class, just as each person cannot betray their own camp.

Because the camp is the accumulation of all behavior.

He did what he did, and that's what made him what he is in his camp.

The adventurous factor within him, which had been amplified in the chaotic headquarters of the abyss, or said to have breathed in the air here.

The true him has returned.

Zhao Xuyu shook his head calmly.

It's no wonder that so many devout pastors who have reached the abyss have all collapsed, either betraying their faith or killing themselves in despair.

Only the most devout followers of the gods will be sent to the abyss to complete a task.

Of course, there's another type - the celestial beings.

They are born with good intentions and have nothing to do with these evil dogs.

The power of the camp is even deeper than a person's skin color.

After calming his inner turmoil, Zhao Xuyu thought to himself, "From now on, I will simply pretend not to understand magic."

This moment, he finally understood why Anzhen Nao had asked him to play the role of a warrior.

This behavior itself is a chaotic manifestation, covering up another part of chaos and preventing himself from using magic, which would cause his inner factors to expand.

As expected, it's step by step.

"Oh, oh."
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu's face turned red as he nodded sincerely towards the enormous and grotesque face of the evil demon lord, "I am truly grateful for your guidance, and I feel enlightened instantly."

As he spoke, Zhou Xu's face turned slightly red as he looked up, "My previous action was just a misunderstanding."

The evil demon lord suddenly burst out laughing, "Do you know how much effort it takes to cultivate a deep-seated original demon into a Baoluo flame demon?"

"You think you can just sow a seed and reap a harvest?" Zhou Xu could only shrug his shoulders, thinking that the so-called "art" was not reliable at all.

However, he also understood that in a battle, a high-level mage was enough. But in a massive war or even ruling a territory, it was necessary to have a sufficient team of experts.

The evil demon lord looked at the overwhelming powerful army, but it was impossible to break the rules of common sense. If they really could mass-produce Baoluo flame demons, it would be a different story, and the Heavenly Mountain would be hard to say, and Arthur's place would be the king of the mountain.

Zhou Xu furrowed his brow.

"Brother, how about we make a deal?"

"I have two extra recovery scrolls here, and I'll use them to revive those two Baoluo flame demons for you."

"I guarantee that the medicine will be effective, and they will revive instantly, with the effect of a dragon rising from the ashes."

As he spoke, Zhou Xu's hand subtly signaled the teleportation technique, and a slight discomfort was felt. Suddenly, the enormous face of the evil demon lord in the void seemed to suppress a smile, and erupted in a loud and intense laughter.
Here is the translation of the text:

The scale of that laughter was almost embarrassing for Zhao Xu's face to turn red. It was as if he had ridden a Ma Lasa to someone's Ferrari and proposed to pay 50 yuan to paint and compensate. Two completely recovered scrolls of magic, 50,000 gold coins, were very expensive, weren't they? If he killed those two Ba Luo demons and searched the treasure, there was no 50,000 gold coins, wasn't there? Zhao Xu was grumbling while waiting for the evil lord's laughter to end. The evil lord's reflex arc and laughter points were weird enough, and his lung capacity was sufficient, and he had held his breath for a long time. However. The laughter suddenly stopped.

"You think I'm short on these two completely recovered magic scrolls." "I'm not short, you're short," Zhao Xu grumbled, "You want it, but I don't want to give it to you."

He was puzzled, and didn't know if it was a real problem with the local feng shui.

Talking to a top-level strong man from the depths of the underworld, he didn't do anything, and his inner words were numerous.

"Well, how about this? I'll kill you with a wave of my hand and then revive you with the completely recovered magic. What do you think?" The evil lord thought and suggested to Zhao Xu.

"Thanks," Zhao Xu waved his hand.

"I'm not used to the body of the evil lord."

At this moment, the negotiation came to a standstill, and Zhao Xu's attitude became more cautious.

He was afraid that he would say something wrong and get caught by the evil lord of the depths of the underworld, and it would be bad.

It was like a demon, although the upper body was excellent, but looking at the two hooves, it was still very unpleasant.

Maybe the demon didn't need to transform into a young girl to deceive people.

"That's it, tell me your identity. Maybe I'll consider it and let you go." The evil lord went back to the original topic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In reality, this is what's meant to happen," Zhao Xu said to himself.

"I'm not sure if I've reached the floating city of Arthur, but it might be possible to make this demon lord open up to me."

After all, the legendary mages in Mistral City can make the demon lords frown, no matter how deep they are in the abyss.

"I think it's possible," Zhao Xu said, "but my instincts are telling me it's not."

"I'm sorry, but I can't reveal my identity to you."

"Oh?"

The demon lord suddenly raised his voice, and his roar was accompanied by a sense of terror, as if the air around him was suddenly heated.

Numerous pressures suddenly pressed down on Zhao Xu, almost choking his throat and making it hard for him to breathe.

Is this the power of the demon lord's anger?

"You think my previous attempt at negotiation is representative of me being willing to compromise?"

The mountains erupted in flames!
The sea surged!
For a moment, a terrifying spectacle unfolded before Zhao Xu's eyes, as if he saw himself being hanged from the gate of the demon city, with countless demons passing by, looking at him with disdain and throwing spears at him.

He seemed to see himself becoming the lowest of the low, repeatedly becoming food for the two Balrogs that had killed him.

The pain of being torn apart.

The scorching sensation.

The fear of being overwhelmed.

A variety of mysterious and unguessable feelings came one after another, playing out in Zhao Xu's heart.

"Iron Heart's Might!"

With his brief recovery of consciousness, Zhao Xu unleashed the strongest secret technique of the nine swords!

If compressing the universe is a negative effect, then this move can block it.

This is its biggest bug."
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as the demon lord's power is determined to be a "negative state", it also falls under the category of the Iron Heart's power range.

The demon lord, who is close to becoming a god, is not yet a true god.

After a moment...

Just when I thought I had all the time in the world, the time seemed to stretch out, making me feel like I had lived through the longest night of my life.

"Is this really the demon lord's power?"

Zhao Xu controlled his emotions, which were difficult to believe, and asked with a tone of incredulity.

"Is it really a powerful insect?"

The demon lord finally let out an incredulous cry, even more exaggerated than when he saw Zhao Xu's limitless transmission technique.

In general, it's the third in heaven.

Zhao Xu's inner self-monologue was completely unaware of the consequences of fulfilling a prophecy.

"Wouldn't it be better to make a bet?"

Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

This demon lord, who was already surprised, seemed to be interested and curious, asking, "What's the bet?"

Zhao Xu looked at his character panel and felt the power of the entire body trembling.

"It's simple - let's bet that I can unleash a counter-magic spell."

"The scroll is no big deal," the demon lord smiled.

"I don't need a scroll."

"I know that some magical items can also be used to cast spells."

"I don't need any magical items," Zhao Xu continued to supplement the bet.

At this point, the demon lord finally understood, asking, "I don't believe you, a five-ring mage like you, can break through reality?"

Zhao Xu just raised an eyebrow, looking at the choice of his voters, and said, "Don't die under the shadow."

"Alright, I agree," the demon lord smiled.

Just for a moment...

Zhao Xu furrowed his brow.

And suddenly...

He had reached level 11.
