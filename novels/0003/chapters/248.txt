Chapter 249 The Truth Underneath

When Zhao Xu heard the sudden awakening of "Lacus" reminding him that something was wrong, his heart was already awakened. However, at this critical moment, it was fortunate that Lacus was able to remind him before he could identify the spell, that it was the "Mage Disintegration Technique" that could break through any defense. 

When he first heard this, Zhao Xu was almost furious. He hadn't done anything unethical at the Fallen Star Lake in his previous life. How could this "Emerald Star Grandmaster" Frank, with just a wave of his hand, cast a spell that could bankrupt him? 

In general, permanent spells like the ones Zhao Xu had cast on himself might seem invincible, but they were not necessarily so. This was because spellcasters could use the "Dispel Magic" of the third circle and the "Greater Dispel Magic" of the sixth circle, to cast spells at the level of the caster and achieve a certain probability of dispelling the spell's effects. 

He built a defense, but others could come and demolish it, or even blow it up. However, when it came to the ninth circle, everything changed. A spell that made both enemies and allies weep was born. The "Mage Disintegration Technique" could 100% dispel all the spell effects on the opponent. If someone was using a life-prolonging spell and it was dispelled, they would die instantly at the end of their lifespan. 

However, if the spell was only dispelled, then this spell would become the "opening move" for mages to greet each other in battle. Unfortunately, it also had an additional effect, causing any mage who dared to use it to inevitably fall into an endless cycle of life and death. This made this spell the "nuclear weapon" of the Arthurian ninth circle mages.
The only thing left is for the Mage Association to convene the Nine-Ring Mages to sign the agreement not to use the "Mage Disintegration Spell" first.
Because this spell will simultaneously dissolve all magical items on the opponent's body.
The value of the item's willpower and the owner's willpower are added together, and a willpower saving throw is made with the higher of the two.
If any one of them fails, the "Mage Disintegration Spell" will restore the item to a normal one.
In other words, if Zhao Xu's "Starry Cloak" worth 130,000 gold coins doesn't make it through, it will become a "common cloak" worth less than a few gold coins.
Zhao Xu really felt the urge to kill on the spot.
But at this moment, the opponent's spell was almost finished chanting.
Otherwise, Zhao Xu would definitely shout, "I have a divine weapon!"
The "Mage Disintegration Spell" is one of the few spells that can destroy divine weapons.
However, the success rate is only 1% of the caster's level, and judging by the current Frank, it definitely wouldn't exceed a quarter of a possibility.
The main point is that once the opponent really destroys the divine weapon without passing the willpower saving throw, it will be the opponent's turn to lose their spellcasting ability.
Even miracle spells and wish spells cannot avoid this situation.
So bringing a divine weapon with you is indeed a good way to protect other magical items.
But now, the opponent hasn't even asked for a conversation, and has already put Zhao Xu in a difficult position.
He immediately activated his "Combined Spell" that he had set up at the beginning.
Zhao Xu first recalled the scene of casting the Sixth-Ring spell "Triggering Spell."
And the process of "recalling" is the condition for his "Triggering Spell" to be activated.
Suddenly, the "Triggering Spell" set on Zhao Xu's body erupted with powerful energy, instantly driving the Fourth-Ring "Swift Burst" spell that he had prepared for.
Relying on this combination, Zhao Xu's entire body instantly started to enter a slow interface, and everything seemed to almost come to a standstill. He had enough precious time to cast the "standard movement" spell. Being able to cast the "swift outbreak" spell before the opponent's spell was completed was the most satisfying aspect of this spell. It was a pity that the opposing mage did not understand the "swift outbreak," otherwise, the opponent could also cast the "swift outbreak" before he activated the "trigger spell." Then Zhao Xu would have to figure out how to dismantle the opponent's "swift outbreak," thus entering a mage battle. However, Zhao Xu did not dwell on it too much, his focus was entirely on the specific response. He tried to cast some defensive spells, which was definitely ridiculous, like using tofu to block a kitchen knife. The mage's cracking spell erupted around the opponent, covering an entire radius of 12 meters. It was four times larger than the range of a fireball spell, and it was impossible to outrun. The entire space of this treasure trove was within the range of the spell, so if he wanted to escape, he had to use teleportation, which would definitely alert people outside. Another way was to put himself in a desperate situation and then use the "anti-magic force field" directly. At this point, Zhao Xu and the opponent were just four meters apart, just outside the range of the spell, unable to stop the opponent from casting spells. But even if the anti-magic field was located outside, it was like a chopping board, with the same probability of destruction as a divine artifact, one percentage point per level. But he still had to deactivate the "anti-magic field" himself later, which was too passive. Just as Zhao Xu hesitated slightly, almost two seconds had already passed.
If he delays any longer, the time for the outbreak will not be enough for him to cast a spell. By then, he will only be able to watch the opponent cast a spell and then watch a bunch of magical equipment turn to ashes and smoke.

Outbreak.

Suddenly, the word flashed in Zhao Xu's mind.

Arthur could blur anything, except for the description of spells on the spell list, there was no room for ambiguity.

The principle of the spell's effect is based on countless theoretical deductions and experiments, and it cannot be changed just because one wants to change it.

So it's an outbreak, not a diffusion!

In other words, if there is something blocking his way.

The spell effect will not reach the rear!

Just like the effect of this spell will not penetrate through the wall.

After thinking this through, Zhao Xu chuckled lightly and cast another five-ring spell -

"Stone Wall!"

A thick and wide stone wall rose directly from the ground, piling up all the way to the ceiling.

It covered an area of more than ten square meters, equivalent to six large beds put together.

It almost separated the entire room.

This spell is not like the elemental "Fire Wall", the protective "Wall of Order", or the illusion "Illusion Wall".

It is a real spell created by the creation branch of magic, a genuine stone wall.

The duration is instantaneous, so the wall will not disappear when the duration ends.

This is also a characteristic of the creation branch of magic, which is not afraid of various anti-magic and dispelling effects.

However, when Zhao Xu instinctively erected the wall.

He found that Frank, who had been blocked in front of him, did not cast a spell.

Then, Zhao Xu saw the nine-ring mage Frank transfer the stone wall in front of him with a spell, but he did not continue casting a spell.
This also made Zhao Xu, who was preparing to counterattack with the second spell, a little surprised.

"Master, he canceled the spell," Lux explained.

"Well done, he actually has the instinct to set up a wall. As a priest, you know a lot about the methods of a mage," the emerald star grandmaster Frank said as he sat down on a high-backed chair, holding a cup of steaming coffee.

"Not fighting anymore?" Zhao Xu asked.

But his brow remained furrowed, showing no signs of relaxation.

Just now, this Frank claimed to be a seventh-circle mage, but he hit him with a ninth-circle spell right away.

He didn't have a second trigger to replenish, let alone the 1-round penalty after casting "Swift Burst" had not yet arrived, so he couldn't release "Swift Burst" again.

"No need, anyone who can use countermeasures has the right to ask me, Frank, questions," the man Frank, whose whole body was shining with a silver-white metallic color, said.

"Casting spells is not difficult, but casting the right spell is something that mages should think about for a lifetime," Frank suddenly sighed.

Zhao Xu also didn't expect this situation, and for a while, the atmosphere became awkward.

"Master, be careful, get closer to him and cover a range of three meters," Lux continued to advise Zhao Xu.

"If the situation is not right, master, you can cast 'Anti-Magic Field'," Lux added.

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask, "Lux, can you transform into a divine tool?"

"Ah, master, why are you reacting so quickly? Did you change personalities?" Lux joked.

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't say anything.
