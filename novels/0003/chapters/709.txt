Chapter 710: Teleportation Gate

With the mastery of the 6-ring trigger technique and the divine eye, Zhao Xu's combat performance has undoubtedly gained a significant advantage.

The redundancy of his actions has reached an almost unimaginable level, to the point where he can simultaneously unleash the power of 5 fundamental laws, capable of destroying heaven and earth, and eliminating monsters of legendary levels.

The remaining powerful spells are not few.

For example, the 6-ring necromantic spell group, "Disease", is an upgraded version of the 3-ring "Disease" spell. It can specify the range of the disease, summon a red and black mist, and provides a wide range of choices for specific diseases, from tremors to nausea, which can severely suppress attributes.

The 6-ring "Bone Shattering" spell is even more formidable. As long as the target's life points are below the caster's level, it will inevitably be stunned for a round, and there is no escape.

In the next round, another check will be made, and if failed, the caster will suffer severe pain and become trapped in a negative status.

In terms of divine spells, the most crucial one is that Zhao Xu has finally mastered the 5-ring resurrection spell.

The dead are revived.

From now on, he has finally broken free from his dependence on scrolls and can revive a biological being with a death time not exceeding the caster's level per day, as long as the other party is willing to revive.

This also means that the massive diamonds in Zhao Xu's treasury can finally be used.

However, the 5000 gold coin revival cost is also a burden that few can afford.

The 5-ring "Lucky Tidal Wave" spell has officially announced Zhao Xu's realization of the possibility of a certain kill.
Here is the translation:

During the duration of the spell, Zhao Xu's attacks, damage, and various checks all gain a 2-level bonus to luck. Moreover, before the spell ends, he can use his intuition to guide the remaining spell energy, creating a perfect moment of luck.

At this instant, the goddess of luck descends.

From then on, in most subsequent checks, such as attacks, saves, skill checks, and spell penetration checks, Zhao Xu is considered to have rolled a perfect 20.

As a result, he can ensure that he will hit a target or save through a threat with certainty.

All unstable performances are condensed into a single perfect point.

From this moment on, Zhao Xu officially breaks free from the constraints of "normal distribution" and gains the ability to roll the largest number possible.

Finally, after mastering six-ring arcane and five-ring divine spells, Zhao Xu's strength reaches its peak, and he leaves the abyss according to his planned route.

His target is the 66th layer of the abyssal pit in the deep abyss.

This layer, unlike the vast majority of the abyss, which is under the dominion of demon lords, is a world belonging to the gods.

As for the spider queen Rose, who has obtained divine power, her territory is considered one of the most notorious plots and evil hubs in the abyss.

Rose's nature means she will not be satisfied with her current situation, otherwise she would not have betrayed the original demon lord and been cast down to the mortal world.

After years of research, Rose, with the help of a secretive mage, has finally found a crucial route.

She can absorb the main material plane's space and absorb it into the abyssal pit, thereby bringing limitless power augmentation.
With each expansion of the demonic web, Rose's own strength and desires are further amplified. Meanwhile, she also covets the powers of those divine beings, attempting to achieve her ultimate goal through the most traditional and evil means, such as murder, assassination, and deception, using the most direct and primitive methods. As for the demonic web, due to its unique nature and multiple layers, it is connected to other planes of existence, making it sometimes easier to enter the web from other dimensions.

Compared to finding a portal to the demonic web in the abyss, this is even simpler. After a moment of disorientation, Zhao Xu successfully cast the "Interdimensional Transmission" spell he had just learned, returning to the physical plane of the material world.

This dimensional transfer spell can transport up to eight companions at most, but the transmission itself has an error range of 8-800 kilometers. However, it is also the most critical step in Zhao Xu's journey between planes.

After returning to the physical plane, Zhao Xu didn't even have time to take in the scenery of the towering mountains around him before realizing that he was off by at least 300 kilometers. He immediately activated the transmission spell and relocated again.

Zhao Xu has no shortage of ways to reach the demonic web, and "Interdimensional Transmission" is just one typical method. However, he needs "secrecy".

In fact, according to the principle of "inner reflection," it is possible that the Lord of the Ninth Prison has already deduced Zhao Xu's ultimate goal through subtle clues in numerous stages. Naturally, the other side will re-examine Zhao Xu's intentions thoroughly, and perhaps the transmission portal to the 66th layer of the demonic web in the fourth layer of the abyss is being closely monitored by malicious eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xiu is waiting for Zhao Xu to get caught in his own trap.

However, the lord of the nine prisons is not aware of Zhao Xu's true identity, which is his greatest advantage.

But Zhao Xu has given up and has decided to use a more cunning method, "the law of light and righteousness", to secretly enter the city under the nose of his enemies.

Zhao Xu wants to use the secret channels left behind by the enemy after they failed to invade and occupy the space. These secret channels are hidden from the eyes of most people and are considered a forbidden method by the enemy.

Zhao Xu is like someone who has gone through customs and immigration, wearing a work uniform, walking into the office area, and then changing into civilian clothes and leaving through the staff entrance.

In reality, the enemy, Luo Si, will not realize that these secret channels have been discovered by a level 11 mage.

Zhao Xu's target is the legendary city of Isitiwen. He walks through the city, feeling the prosperity and bustle around him, with the sounds of street vendors, women washing at the pool, and blacksmiths hammering away.

The city seems peaceful and prosperous, but it has a dark history. According to a secret deep history, Luo Si once dispatched the giant mountain tribes, fire giant tribes, and frost giant tribes to form an alliance.
Here is the translation:

At some point in the past, this layer of the abyss was shrouded in a giant black magical hemisphere, theoretically taken into the abyss, waiting to be slowly enveloped.

However, afterwards, the city's heroes, with their lives on the line, attacked and defeated the spider queen's scheme, allowing the shadowy city to catch its breath again.

Zhao Xu then observed the situation and slowly walked to the central square of the city, Quil Tana, where he took a panoramic view of the surroundings. He noticed that most people were gathered around a minstrel, listening to his recitation of heroic poetry.

According to the laws of the void domain, even if the spider queen had failed to occupy the city, she had not given up completely and had used her last resort, leaving behind a secret portal that could lead to the void abyss.

However, this was a special portal that, in essence, allowed the dark army of the abyss to reach the city of Ishtiwen at a specific time node through this portal.

The portal was located in a small alleyway beside the square, and to prevent accidental contact or falls, the portal was set to have a "return" feature, allowing only those who had reached the city's target through the portal to return.

But to Zhao Xu, none of these were major concerns.

Magic, after all, was a shortcut that appeared due to the loopholes in the world's laws.

"Analyze the portal!"
Zhao Xu directly cast this spell, as the magical energy accumulated, his eyes flashing red, and a formless force field of 20 meters in radius appeared before him, as if countless infrared lines were scanning the area.

This revealed to him the "portals" and "interdimensional gates" in this region.
Here is the translation of the text:

To be honest, usually, in those secret and hidden places beneath the city, there may be people who use "Detection of Secret Doors" and other magic to search and investigate. However, for a square with a constant stream of people, even a powerful mage who has mastered many spells won't resort to such foolish behavior.

Zhao Xu, who knows the details, maintains his concentration as he weaves through the alleys of the square, one by one.

It's undeniable that Rosa has taken into account tactical layout, as the Quetalanta Square is located at the center of the city, surrounded by the most densely populated residential areas. Once the Abyssal Army descends upon this place, it's inevitable that a sword will be inserted into the core position.

After expending half an hour's journey, Zhao Xu finally caught sight of a portal emitting an otherworldly glow within his line of sight.

Throughout the process, he was under the "Invisibility" spell, and no one noticed his presence as an outsider.

The portal was merely attached to a high wall adjacent to a stone frame, three meters high, within the scope of "Analyzing Portals". The intricate patterns of spiders could be seen, including the waxwork demon clan cared for by Rosa.

Zhao Xu lightly touched the portal with his hand, which emitted a faint glow.

It was icy cold, with no unusual sensations, and he was not suddenly sucked in.

It seemed like just an illusion, a trick of the mind.

It's not that there was no mage who used the six-ring "Eternal Illusion" spell to create an eternal illusion of a portal, fooling a group of apprentices into bumping into the wall.

Zhao Xu, who had researched portals, was clear that this kind of illusion could only trigger the "Return" effect, which is essentially a setting for a transmission factor.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xiaoxu can create a portal that only allows humans to pass through or only allows targets wearing a specific pendant to pass through. This way, he can use a two-way portal to launch a one-way attack.

However, magic can be countered by magic. Directly from his backpack's scroll storage, Zhou Xiaoxu pulled out a scroll with the only existing eight-ring spell "Reset Portal" that only gods of transmission and clergy can grant to those who have chosen the transmission domain.

However, using a scroll, Zhou Xiaoxu cannot use any compressive spellcasting time manipulation. He simply unfolded the parchment and looked at the complicated incantation, starting a 10-minute spellcasting time.

Slowly, Zhou Xiaoxu's incantation began to radiate an extraordinary magical glow, transforming into a shimmering blue light strip that automatically wrapped around the portal.

At this moment, Zhou Xiaoxu let out a loud shout from the depths of his heart!

"Change the elements, reverse the return to restrict the passage of those who came from the Abyss an hour ago."

This is called sneaking, which is quietly opening the door with a key and then restoring it to its original state, rather than tearing down the door and entering.

After a while, Zhou Xiaoxu continued to use the effect of "Analyze Portal" to see that the elements he had changed had taken effect.

Taking precautions, he cast the four-ring "Scenic Transmission Portal" to ensure that the opposite side of the portal had not set up a hundred-strong formation of swordsmen.

Relieved, he took a step forward and directly entered the portal.

But half a step away, two children playing and wiping their noses suddenly cried out in shock, "What feels like a chilly wind?"
Here is the translation:

Another child, slightly older, quickly grabbed his hand and said, "Even if the devil takes over this place today, you still have to finish this hand!"

...

As Zhao Xu crossed the transmission portal, his entire body was filled with an unparalleled sense of caution, tightly clutching the transmission wand in his hand. As soon as there was even a slight change or anomaly in the environment, he would immediately burst into action without hesitation.

First, he released the "Iron Heart" to remove any constraints on the transmission state, and then swiftly activated the "Interdimensional Transmission" escape.

This brief dive into the depths left him realizing that even the greatest destiny could not withstand the risks that lurked everywhere.

Each demon in the depths could easily survive, and they were all filled with an aura of vitality. It was no wonder that each and every one of them desperately wanted to sneak into the main material plane.

However, Zhao Xu did not think much of it at first, assuming it was just a common scene in the 66th layer of the demon network's depths. But when he actually arrived, he discovered that something was off.

Purely based on his feelings, he sensed that this was not a place of good fortune. This was a large stone chamber with a corner, covered in purple fungi growing on the walls and ceiling, emitting a faint, eerie glow.

The floor was also scattered with branches and broken bones, and even the remains of tattered clothes were scattered across the sandy floor. Five identical doors were lined up on the opposite wall, awaiting Zhao Xu's arrival.

This was a labyrinth!
