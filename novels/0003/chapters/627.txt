Chapter 628: The Origin of Output, Fierce Attack!

"'Bahamut's summoning is essentially transforming oneself into Bahamut's dragon offspring,' Bahamut's calling is not just a simple reproduction, but a rebirth," Zhao Xu explained, looking at the puzzled expressions on everyone's faces.

"In general, those who can become dragons are mostly in their teenage years when they first hear the call of the Golden Dragon, and some may discover it later in their careers. However, not everyone who hears the call responds." Zhao Xu said quietly, his eyes fixed on the flames before him.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu slowly drew out his staff, and the flames before him transformed into a shield emblem featuring a dragon's head, which was the sacred emblem of the benevolent dragon god Bahamut.

"Summons are events that can only be experienced firsthand, like a spiritual exchange of etiquette. Bahamut will ask the opponent's inner heart and soul if they are willing to offer themselves to a glorious and perilous world - a world protected by the evil dragon god Tyramat and her minions." Zhao Xu said, gazing at the people before him.

"If one is willing, they will lose everything from their past, including their original family and friends, and become Bahamut's offspring," Zhao Xu said, his eyes fixed on the people before him.

As for the specific rebirth ritual required to become a dragon, such as fasting for a day, contemplating one's choices, and sleeping and waking up in a dragon-shaped device (100 gold coins), Zhao Xu did not elaborate.

"What abilities will Bahamut's summoning grant?" someone asked.

In the end, it's all just an illusion.
Here is the translation:

Only the abilities that are truly brought about can be considered truly unparalleled.

Looking at the crowd, who had no idea about the solemnity of becoming a dragon kind, Zhao Xu didn't care and continued to say, "A dragon kind will have a majestic dragon-like appearance, which can be regarded as a human-dragon hybrid."

"+2 physique -2 agility is a characteristic of a dragon kind's health and clumsiness."

"Immune to dragon's wrath, because they are themselves dragons, and can also choose three qualities during the transformation process, and cannot be changed afterwards."

"The three qualities are 'heat' (supernatural ability), similar to the effect of dragon's breath. 'Soul' (special ability), immune to sleep and obtain dark vision, with +2 racial bonus in searching and scouting."

"The last one is flight, which can grow out complete wings, similar to the ability of the winged people I mentioned before, and can perform a permanent and constant flight technique, which is a feat that humans on Earth have spent thousands of years trying to achieve."

Although Zhao Xu only mentioned this, the crowd felt that he was hinting at something more, and understood that Bahamut's call was not as simple as imagination, but was indeed a key bridge for some special person cards.

Even without mentioning other things, just growing wings and having the ability to fly was already a permanent and constant three-ring flight technique, which humans on Earth had spent thousands of years trying to achieve.

"Well, the key part is coming up next, which is the specialization ability section, which is what everyone can access now."

Zhao Xu also understood that everyone's appetite was already hanging in the air.

In reality, he wanted to say that the specialization ability he was about to simulate was based on his latent potential.

Additionally, he had a two-ring magic and spirit attachment, so Zhao Xu could always have two additional warrior specializations at any time.
Here's the translation:

"Specialization-wise, the most basic and dependent specialization for a warrior is the one I'm going to talk about," said Zhao Xuan first.

"Brutal Attack," exclaimed the young warrior Ma Yu Fan immediately, a conclusion that was difficult to disagree with for countless listeners.

Brutal Attack was a specialization Zhao Xuan had mastered when he was level 5 and used his hidden potential to simulate it.

It can sacrifice X-level attack power and increase damage by 2X.

It's equivalent to trading off attack accuracy for damage intensity, which is quite frustrating for warriors and barbarians, who don't know how to balance it.

However, this ability also allows them to deal a direct killing blow to some low-defense monsters or ordinary people.

"Now, let me mention a new specialization, 'Jump and Smash'. It requires an 8-level jump and the Brutal Attack specialization. The effect is to combine charging and jumping to strike at the enemy, increasing the damage from Brutal Attack by one-fold, and increasing it by two-fold if wielding a dual-hand weapon."

In other words, if Zhao Xuan wields a heavy sword, sacrifices 10-level attack power, charges and jumps, the 10-level attack can bring an additional 60 points of extra damage.

At his current level 10, he can execute a double-hit combo and add the third hit with the speed skill, resulting in an additional 180 points of damage.

Just waving his sword around a few times is enough to kill people. A warrior's damage output is not like that of a mage, which increases with level, and relies on this Brutal Attack to make a living.

And this is still just level 10, let alone reaching higher levels!

"How do you learn this 'Jump and Smash' specialization?" exclaimed the young warrior, who was so excited he could hardly contain himself, as if he had rediscovered the spring of a warrior.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the numerous players outside the cave were all secretly screaming in their hearts, "Tell me more, hurry up and explain how to master the Jump and Strike technique."

Unbeknownst to them, Zhao Xu's topic continued to unfold like a university lecture, and one could easily get lost in thought, wondering what they were doing here.

"Are you satisfied with that?" Zhao Xu joked.

"Brute Force Attack can be said to be a must-have expertise for all warriors, and no player will neglect to learn it," Zhao Xu joked.

The prerequisites for the 13-point Power Surge are not difficult, and Zhao Xu had mastered this expertise quickly in his previous life.

The damage output curve of melee combat relies on the basic weapon damage, power bonus, and combo amplification.

Brute Force Attack can be said to be the most cost-effective way for warriors to increase their output.

"However, sacrificing attack power to increase damage may also lead to a significant decrease in the effectiveness of skills that rely on attack power, and may even render them useless," Zhao Xu analyzed.

As it is, players' attack strength is already limited, and once they overextend themselves, they will only be hitting the air.

"So, the next focus will be on the 'Jump and Strike' technique, outside of 'Brute Force Attack'. Its prerequisites are 6th-grade basic attack, Brute Force Attack expertise, and the useless 'Expert Charge' expertise."

"This is the 'Assault Vanguard' expertise, and mastering it will make you extremely skilled at breaking through enemy lines in combat. The expertise can activate three tactics: biasing, Domino Effect, and Light Charge. Among them, Light Charge is the most critical, requiring that the attack reduction cannot be less than five, but can transfer the weakened attack to defense level, up to the basic attack bonus."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If you can take down the enemy's commander with one blow, who would care if you still have no defense? Even a foolish warrior like Ma Yu Fan can realize the great power of this skill.

The forceful attack increases damage, the jumping slash increases the forceful damage, and the sharp attack avoids the forceful attack and reduces damage.

Zhao Xu directly starts with "forceful attack" as the starting point, spreading out the key to the entire output.

Just mentioning the two skills after that has made the outside world like they are drunk, and their spirits are shaken.

"The remaining output key is to solve the problem of only being able to hit once after charging forward."

"Monsters have a kind of ability called 'fierce tackle' that can launch a full-turn attack after charging forward. The two-ring spell 'Lion's Charge' can achieve this point."

Zhao Xu also muttered to himself, but this is not a problem for him because he has a spell that lasts.

"However, we don't have spells, and it's not like we're going to take up three-level spellcasting, right?" someone asked.

But Zhao Xu just shook his head and said, "The barbarian has a variant ability, the lion's totem, which can get the fierce tackle. So, taking up a level-one barbarian and getting the fierce tackle is indeed very cost-effective."

Various unknown secrets were slowly analyzed by Zhao Xu, although no one knows how to exchange it, but everyone remembered it sincerely.

As for Zhao Xu, he could only sigh.

Taking up a job is the most solid foundation for Arthur's card."
