Chapter 592: Corpse Mountain and Sea, Summoning the Heavens

Although the sun had not yet set, the sky was still bright and clear. Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the eastern part of the camp, and a brilliant light pierced through the clouds, as if a jagged tooth had been inserted into the mountain guard post. This was a "Summoning of the Heavens" spell cast by Drui, although its power was limited to 3-18 (3D6) and could only be used once a minute. However, it was a minute-level spell that could summon lightning.

As the lightning struck, the patrols on the perimeter of the camp felt an intense sense of fear, even though they knew their families were behind them. The fear of death was deeply etched on the faces of these ordinary people who had never been to war before.

Behind them was a scene that would haunt their dreams even in broad daylight. Countless undead beings emerged from the earth like ants, crawling out of their holes and advancing towards the living. The skeletons, with their skulls aglow with a red light, moved with an unnatural gait, their bony fingers grasping for the living. The reanimated corpses, once brought back to life by evil and dark magic, stumbled and lurched forward like mindless corpses.

These reanimated corpses looked like ordinary humans, but with the skull's red glow, giving them a strange and eerie appearance.
The corpses-like bodies of the undead resembled those dragged out of a tomb, with half of their bodies completely decayed and some organs even eaten away by insects. The rags wrapped around their bodies emitted a foul stench that wafted through the air. Normally, people would freak out when they saw a freshly "revived" skeleton or zombie, but this time, they were faced with an unprecedented and terrifying army of the undead.

The archers stationed on the stronghold's towers took aim and fired arrows, only to realize that the enemy was too numerous to be repelled. The defenseless camp was unable to withstand the attack of these undead creatures. Moreover, there were even more powerful undead beings lurking behind them, such as vengeful spirits, shadowy figures, and female demons, which hovered in mid-air. The larger and more imposing night demons and imprisoned souls followed closely behind the undead army.

As the retreat horn sounded once more, the fleeing militiamen finally had a chance to regroup and reorganize. The players who had been supporting them from behind also let out a sigh of relief. However, two careless players failed to retreat in time and were swiftly surrounded by the undead horde, only to be consumed and transformed into corpses.

Before they could even respond, the sheer number of undead overwhelmed them. "This is getting ridiculous!" exclaimed Zhao Xu, who had already anticipated the worst but couldn't help but exclaim in surprise at the sheer scale of the undead army. The barren landscape was now a sea of undead creatures, stretching as far as the eye could see.
Here is the translation of the text:

While farther away, there was a "deeply buried, pitch-black pit" that could be seen, with countless corpses crawling out of it, resembling a mass grave.

Zhao Xu immediately activated the "short message" for the person in charge of this negotiation.

The short message, no more than 25 words, contained a secret code, so the recipient would know that it was Summer Solstice. The only requirement was that the camp would withdraw, and the farther the better.

Unless a legendary wizard appeared at this moment, none of the forces in this desolate land, not even the God's Shepherds, could resist the tide of millions of "undead creatures".

"'Fireball Technique, ' Extremely Effective', 'Extension of Technique' (simulation)" Zhao Xu gazed at the approaching undead creatures, and directly cast a fireball spell to clear the area.

Immune to various negative states, the undead creatures were mostly directly consumed by the fire damage.

Originally, the fireball technique had a 6.5-meter radius of effect, but with the "Extension of Technique" specialization, the radius was increased to 12 meters.

Instantly, all the undead creatures within the fireball range were injured and thrashing about, like those drowning.

Still, it was of no use.

Zhao Xu shook his head at this scene and continued to cast his spell in secret.

"Supernatural Technique - War Technique: High-Voltage Lightning Rod."

The next moment, a lightning bolt over 30 meters long and 6 meters wide, resembling a lightning screen, directly lay across the ground, blocking the path in that area.

Suddenly, a high-energy power grid appeared in the empty space, immediately wiping out the undead creatures in the long, rectangular area.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was like spraying insecticide on an ant colony, with a quick effect, but completely ineffective against the massive number of enemies. "War Magic: Heat Wave (Four Rings)."

Zhao Xu looked at the situation and quickly cast this war magic, which was even faster than the lightning bolt and had a 30-meter long, low-lying, mobile flame wall that could also last for multiple rounds.

However, it was just like that.

Zhao Xu looked at his own magic and realized that this war was no longer something that could be resolved with just one or two magic spells.

He also understood that the massive and magnificent magic effects he had created would instantly grab everyone's attention, but as long as they didn't fall into enemy hands, they wouldn't suffer any losses.

"God, save us!" "Oh God, you have the power to save us, or we will fail as humans!"

The crowd of retreating people also occasionally let out cries of despair, with some begging for divine intervention and others cursing and swearing at the enemy.

Zhao Xu could only tightly watch the crowd, and just as they were about to reach out to him, he would cast the "War Magic: Force Field Flying Bomb" spell.

With this spell, he could generate a force field that could temporarily suppress the aggression of the undead creatures within a 12-meter radius, giving the retreating crowd some space.

However, as Zhao Xu continued to cast his spells, the powerful undead creatures from the rear also began to surround him.

The laughter filled with death and resentment began to ring in his ears, announcing the return of death.
