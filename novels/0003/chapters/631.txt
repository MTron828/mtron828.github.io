Chapter 632: Mysterious Influence, True Heaven

As Zhao Xu threw out a wave of "no-charge" spells, the "giant skulls" that looked decent suddenly felt their skeletons crumbling like plastic. The original abilities of these wild warriors, amplified by the "frenzied art" of the spell, instantly transformed them into a "killer's aura".

Like an ant swarm, the skulls surrounded and devoured the player team, just like a wave of infinite chain attacks. In the blink of an eye, they became a pile of shattered limbs.

These white bones, accumulated over countless months, were finally awakened by the demon king's device from the underground. However, they were still unable to withstand a single round before returning to the land of the dead, waiting for the next awakening.

At this point, Zhao Xu had not cast a single "hurtful spell", but his teammates had reached an extremely high level. Notably, the morale-boosting spell that influenced the mind had stacked up, making these players become fearless and unstoppable.

Although no one knew where Zhao Xu's healing spell came from, each person was fighting with great enthusiasm.

Just as someone barely dodged a sword and was about to be struck, a "healing heavy blow" would suddenly come crashing down, allowing the player to instantly recover to their current blood level, even if they were on the brink of death.

Playing an RPG online game is just like that, right?

At this moment, everyone felt that Arthur's healing was incredibly timely and intense, and that Arthur's buff could amplify their status to the point where their stats became extremely dense.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Go, right there!" Zhao Xu yelled, waving his hand to signal the team to move forward as he continued to cast "Dance of Light" as a beacon to guide the team.

Compared to solo battles, the first challenge of team leadership is communication, which is why ancient wars employed drums and flags to convey signals. In this moment, the light arrow cast by Zhao Xu was a guiding light for the team.

Suddenly, the players below rushed towards the dark tunnel, and the entire team was filled with an intense excitement due to their consecutive victories.

However, Zhao Xu remained quiet, secretly paying attention to a few potential targets he had been eyeing, including the Clearleaf sisters and the over ten people he had just briefed on the charge direction.

He also felt deeply that, no matter how similar people may seem, each individual's nature is inherently different, and that as long as they possess resources, they will inevitably prioritize their own interests. Even siblings may exhibit such tendencies, such as favoring one child over another.

Therefore, Zhao Xu used the "Care" spell, a level 3 spell that allows him to sense the direction, distance, and state of the target, including whether they are injured, paralyzed, unconscious, or confused.

In a dramatic sense, Zhao Xu was like the ultimate caregiver at this moment, with a digital status panel displaying the status of over ten people he needed to keep an eye on. As long as anyone in the team was in trouble, he could quickly restore their state with the "Care" spell, which provided a modern digital status panel.

At this moment, everyone was under his watchful eye, and the spell's residual effects covered them all.
Here is the translation of the text:

If he were to exaggerate, he would exhibit the "Higher Attention" of the Four Rings. In this case, even if the target is separated from him, he can directly cast the "Touch" spell from zero to two rings, and no matter how far apart they are, he can add healing spells to the opponent's body.

As soon as a mighty shout echoed through the cave, the sound of footsteps grew louder, and the echoes of the shout spread through the tunnel.

"Formation Defense!"

Zhao Xu immediately shouted out, noticing the crisis ahead. The next second, the players who were about to charge in also halted, because they saw countless ghostly shadows emerging from the cracks in the walls, ignoring the spiritual bodies of the building.

"Fireball!"
"Thunderbolt!"
"Dispel Undead!"
"Divine Slash!"
"Hostile: Undead."

As the players saw the scene of life and death unfolding, they immediately pulled out their own special skills, and the originally monotonous melee output team suddenly became chaotic.

"Warspell - Force Field Storm!"

Zhao Xu, who was hovering in mid-air, also didn't hesitate, and threw out a wide-range attack spell.

"Supernatural Control - Spell Mastery!" Feeling the intensity of these undead bodies, Zhao Xu used about 30% of his strength and gave them a slap.

"You're the enemy of my enemy," he said.

Suddenly, a voice as cold as ice came from behind Zhao Xu, with a tone that was both extremely hoarse and reminiscent of the crackling of flames.

As Zhao Xu turned around, he saw at least ten skeletal figures suspended in mid-air, tightly packed behind him. Their skin was like withered bone, with a thin layer of muscle remaining, wrapped around the skeletal framework.
The skeletal bodies floating in mid-air had long since decomposed, their eyes vanished, yet the empty sockets still pulsed with a crimson glow like sharp needles. "Ah, a lich!" "Good heavens, so many of them!" "What to do? Just annihilate them?" The players below suddenly let out a collective gasp, and the morale that had been building up, thanks to Zhao Xu's waves of encouragement, instantly plummeted by half.

It wasn't that the players were cowardly, but rather that the lich's reputation was so formidable that it weighed heavily on everyone's mind, like a block of lead.

In the legend of King Arthur, liches often appeared as the final boss in the hero's journey. Moreover, because they had concealed their life force within their tombs, even if they were killed, they would automatically resurrect within 1-10 seconds.

As such, liches were particularly suitable for some stories where the villain was invulnerable to death, allowing the story to be prolonged.

In reality, liches, driven by their desire to plunder the life force of the living, had, on numerous occasions, razed entire villages and towns in a fit of rage.

Even on the forum, there were numerous players who had encountered liches and ended up with tragic stories of being turned into specimens.

The spellcasters with permanent life, regardless of the angle of judgment, would find it extremely troublesome to face such an opponent. Simply relying on their patience, they could exhaust countless enemies.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was not surprised to suddenly encounter over ten liches, or rather, liches above level 11, equivalent to at least six circles of a spellcaster.

The fear aura emanating from these liches spread and permeated through the air, infecting everyone who gazed upon them, leaving them with a sense of tearing and fear.

"Very calm, not anxious at all."
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the demeanor of the master of Ya Nan?" "It seems to be a good exchange object, what do you think?"

Suddenly, these floating wizards, interrupting each other, as if they had no unified opinion about Zhao Xiu. "I think it's easier to discuss with subordinates."

"Not wrong, let's catch him first and then talk?"

"I have a vague impression of this guy, like he's been here before."

At this point, the 12 wizards, even if one person spoke, would amount to 12 sentences. After they gathered together, each person had a different opinion on Zhao Xiu. Some advocated for peace, while others advocated for strikes.

The key issue was that, regardless of whose opinion it was, Zhao Xiu didn't care.

"Do you know the location of the dragon crystal vein in the underground?"

Zhao Xiu suddenly asked.

Unfortunately, as undead creatures, the wizards' rigid minds made them immune to the influence of mental magic. Otherwise, Zhao Xiu could have used this one sentence to read the truth from the shallow consciousness of the wizards.

"Oh? You know about the dragon crystal vein? Who told you?"

"Let's catch him and torture him."

"No, support."

"I'll let him taste the flavor of my separation technique."

All of a sudden, these flying wizards, after a brief commotion, decided on the treatment of Zhao Xiu.

The key issue was that Zhao Xiu didn't care about the opinions of these undead wizards at all.

Compared to the chaotic team of players below, who were filled with fear, Zhao Xiu's heart was crystal clear, and he was clear about his next plan.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu raised the "Heavenly Paradise" in his hand, he was preparing to demonstrate the frontal assault tactics he had just described to the crowd, saying that no matter how many times he explained it, it was still not as effective as a real-life demonstration.

Immediately, the ancient weapon in Zhao Xu's hand, the "Heavenly Paradise" long sword, as a +1 unwavering style long sword, proudly displayed its magical prowess, emitting a dazzling magical glow, which was also a manifestation of Zhao Xu's possession of basic ancient abilities.

"Enhance Magic!"

This time, he chose an enchantment to attach...

Just as Zhao Xu was about to make a decision in his mind, a sudden and mysterious disappearance occurred in front of him.

The wizards disappeared without a trace.

They seemed to have seen the most terrifying existence in the world, and each one retreated to the back, completely ignoring the giant rocks.

"Run! Hurry!"

This sudden turn of events left Zhao Xu, who was about to demonstrate a dozen or so continuous combat techniques to the crowd, feeling perplexed and unable to figure out what was happening.

Not only were the wizards gone, but also the ghostly apparitions, undead creatures, and other non-corporeal beings that had previously emerged, all retreated in a state of panic, each trying to escape in the opposite direction.

It was as if the "Heavenly Paradise" in Zhao Xu's hand, which was once a mere long sword, had become a "divine tool" capable of killing all undead creatures.

And in the next moment, the ordinary long sword in Zhao Xu's hand suddenly emitted a bright and clear light, shining deep into the cave.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the distant seemed to penetrate the heavens, and a gentle, holy melody slowly drifted in from afar, seeping into the depths of people's ears. "Dad," "Mom," "Wife," "Daughter," "Fool," the voices echoed through the cavern.

The players below Zhao Xü's eyes all seemed to be in a state of euphoria, as if they had all seen their closest relatives. They waved their hands, and even the stalactites and stalagmites began to glow with an otherworldly light.

But Zhao Xü's eyes were filled only with darkness and chaos. Even the light that seemed to emanate from the crystal sword in his hand was tinged with an air of mystery.

As he gazed at the crystal sword, Zhao Xü suddenly felt a sense of unease. For on the crystal surface, his own face seemed to be smiling mysteriously.

"True knowledge gem!" Zhao Xü exclaimed, clutching the last of the true knowledge gems he had brought with him. Although this gem could pierce through all illusions and kill the entire fantasy school, it could only be activated for half an hour a day.

But even that was enough. Through the gem, Zhao Xü's eyes seemed to see the world in even greater clarity, filled with intricate details.

But the light from the cavern deepened, and the crystal sword still seemed to hold Zhao Xü's enigmatic smile. Even his lips seemed to curl up slightly, as if he were a deliberate jester.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, all the players underground stretched out their hands, grasping the vacuum of the front, with a happy and harmonious expression.

The originally quiet air was filled with an urgent sense of panic.

"Who is it?"

Zhao Xuan's cold and icy tone was filled with killing intent.

He even suspected that it was the effect of the new "Demonic Device".

But he hadn't figured out why these undead creatures, upon seeing his "Human Paradise", had shrunk back to this extent.

In this crucial moment, something unexpected happened, directly pushing the entire scene to an unimaginable state.

It was as if an invisible hand had stretched out from the void, driving the dark development of events.

At this time, Zhao Xuan saw something that made his hair stand on end, more terrifying than his own eerie smile. The witches who had initially fled in terror were now returning from their original disappearance.

They knelt on the ground, as if being pulled by an invisible rope on their heads, slowly moving towards Zhao Xuan.

These powerful witches, who could cause a town's political turmoil, were now like dead dogs, being forcibly dragged.

They had become expressionless, their skeletal bodies stiff and rigid, rubbing against the ground and emitting a hoarse voice.

"Obey my lord."
"Obey my lord."

These witches, along with the shadowy silhouettes and spirits behind them, continuously muttered to themselves, as if only by doing so could they express the deepest and most sincere voices from within.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xuan asked coldly.

"I am you."
