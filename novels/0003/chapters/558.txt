Chapter 559 The land of Yanan, all are sacred dwellings
With the violent and deafening roar, a courtyard in front was instantly smashed by Zhao Xu's two legendary golems.
These "legendary golems of fine gold" combined with "legendary golems of secret silver," together, they had an impact of tens of tons, instantly destroying the nearby buildings.
Even if the members of the family inside escaped, they still wanted to cry when they saw this scene.
For these frontier town families, the greatest achievement of generations of effort was to build a magnificent mansion.
This is also the reason why they still struggle to leave their homeland despite knowing that Zhao Xu has returned.
The mansion is the most solid "pass" for every free citizen in the town.
These desperate people, without the strength of adventurers, would be at the level of ghost gates if they stayed overnight in the wild.
And at this moment, Zhao Xu's actions shattered their hopes.
Like some remote towns on Earth, if drug dealers were simply executed, they would feel no regrets, thinking that they had built their houses with drug money.
The truly brutal punishment is to escort them to the house they worked so hard to build, and then blow up the house on the spot, executing them in the process of tearing their hearts and lungs apart.
This is the true way to prevent others from committing crimes again.
Zhao Xu directly threw out the "golems" that had committed major crimes in the Alliance's city of Orudou, also as a warning to the Alliance.
If they provoke him again, the next time will be to invade their homes and destroy all their property.
At this moment, Zhao Xu kept muttering to himself, "Let you be ungrateful, let you eat and drink."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's hard to say, but for months, Zhao Xu has been devotedly responding to this land that once nurtured him.

But he still didn't think that the repayment would be like this from the townspeople.

It's as if he has exchanged his sincerity for absolute loyalty.

With the four-ring "reading memory" ability, he can analyze the entire list of participants in the event without any obstacles.

Zhao Xu, who has studied the distribution map of the residents of Star Town and has detailed maps, can close his eyes and sketch the location and population characteristics of each household.

At this point, it's easy for him to pinpoint these houses and wreak havoc.

"Turn stone into mud!"

Zhao Xu instantly casts this five-ring spell, and the blue-white glow falls on the foundation of a house.

The "X for X" series spell, which is basically used on uncarved stone materials, so Zhao Xu can only apply it to the foundation.

Although he may not be able to convert 15 cubic meters of stone into 15 cubic meters of mud, he can still shake the foundations of these limited houses with ease.

In an instant, the "light offense" families that were not covered by the magic, were shaken by him, causing the houses to sway and collapse, looking terrifying.

"We were wrong, Mr. Zhongxiao, stop it!"

"Really, we were forced to do it."

Zhao Xu, looking like he's playing a game, carelessly destroys the entire town's building complex.

The residents around him dare not approach him and can only shout from a distance.

"Go to the fields where my invisible crops cry out," Zhao Xu says normally, but he has no intention of stopping.

In reality, he is also filled with anger inside."
Here is the translation of the text:

The villagers of the small town had been waiting for the high-level officials to return with some grain to ensure a smooth transfer of the remaining grain. However, they underestimated him. He walked to the warehouse where he had appointed someone to take care of the grain. It was the other party who had first stirred up the crowd, causing all the backup plans laid out by Zhao Xu to fail. A middle-aged man, with a look of resignation, said, "Kill me." At this point, he had already sent away all his family members and sat alone at the door, following the arrangement of his behind-the-scenes mastermind to utilize the last bit of his life's energy to ensure the safety of his entire family.

As he sat there, Zhao Xu's voice was cold and detached. "It was I who promoted you from a laborer at the merchant guild to the core of the warehouse. And now you've betrayed your brothers and caused the death of those who were once your comrades?" Zhao Xu's voice grew angrier.

In his previous life, Ti Ki had started from the merchant guild and had even become a good friend. Therefore, Zhao Xu had allowed him to bypass the process of growth and development. But who knew that he would be bitten back, and it would wake him up to realize that he couldn't make decisions based solely on his past thoughts.

Because every person is complex, and at the moment of growth, which idea will become the final plan, no one can be sure. Otherwise, there would be no "Zhou Gong's ominous words" or "Wang Mang's humble and unassuming attitude" in history. Sometimes, dying before one's time can make someone a hero or a traitor.

"What else do you have to say?" Zhao Xu asked in response.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmph, you can't defeat them. You think your magic is powerful, but you have no idea. You're facing a tremendous force. All it takes is a slight lift of the wheel, and you'll be easily crushed, my lord!"

As he spoke, a thread of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head. He had already detected the opponent's intentions through his divination magic.

"Pretending to be a hero on Earth, you're actually a traitor. I promoted you, and now you're resentful because you've become a big shot in just half a year," he said with a sigh.

"Alright, let's see what history will bring."

"Curse! Twin Born!"

As a curse with a notorious reputation for its negative effects, it had several powerful effects. At this moment, the twin-born curse was activated, and Zhao Xu chose the effect that gave the opponent a 50% chance of being unable to act each round.

The second effect was a 6-point reduction in agility. The opponent was forever trapped in a state of perpetual slowness.

"Feeble Mind!" 

The strategist who had planned the entire operation became a simpleton, with an intelligence level of 1 point, unable to make any decisions.

"Evil Transformation!" 

The subordinate responsible for negotiating with other merchants was transformed into a distant, distant pointer. The originally fleeing person slowly became a frantic old mouse, unaware of their own transformation.

After completing these spells, Zhao Xu turned back to see that all the doors and windows of the town were tightly shut, not daring to open, fearful of his power.

Zhao Xu then shook his head and walked directly to the town hall, removing the hand ring that was hanging from his hand.

Earlier, Viola had been too afraid to kill, and the villagers had chased her away.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu was removing each fireball bead from the fireball necklace, each representing a single fireball. Suddenly, he became a fierce thrower, just like a baseball pitcher. In an instant, under the power of his 40-strength throw, the fireball bead shot through the window like a cannonball, making a "bang" sound.

The entire house shook with a loud explosion-like vibration, and the people hiding inside the city hall building were undoubtedly annihilated. He was like throwing multiple powerful hand grenades into the room.

Zhao Xu didn't even pause, directly walking from room to room, dropping one by one, like a carpet search. He blew up every room in the city hall building.

"Are you satisfied now?" Finally, including the town mayor and others, everyone was forced to the end of the corridor.

"You're not going to kill us anyway," the town mayor, who had already received a guarantee, said with a tough tone.

"You think I'm afraid?" Zhao Xu replied.

Immediately, Zhao Xu lightly removed the fireball bead and made a throwing motion.

For some reason, the fireball bead he threw himself was even more powerful.

However, this behavior of wasting magical items brought him a higher sense of satisfaction.

"Mercy, mercy!" The town mayor, who didn't expect Zhao Xu to really kill them, shouted loudly.

"No need," Zhao Xu said, and his hand-held fireball bead had already been thrown, exploding into a six-meter fireball that covered the distance, just reaching Zhao Xu's front without invading even a little.

It was clear that the scope of the spell had been tightly sealed by Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

He was like a conductor, quietly arranging the tempo of the entire conference.

"I can ask you guys about the corpses, they're more honest," he said.

"Dead people are talking!"

"...It was transmitted so quickly!"

After completing the killing rhythm of the small town, Zhao Xu quickly returned to the barren wasteland.

Since the small town didn't need him as a nominal leader, he became the true leader of this land.

This land, which he had opened up himself, would give him all the power.

The location he had chosen was the location of the former Blue Star remnants' capital city, which King Qingwei had carefully considered and selected from among ten targets.

At this moment, the outermost area was swarming with countless people, all of whom were fellow travelers who were incredibly curious about the sudden appearance of this building.

Some of them even almost knelt down to worship a miracle.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu's companions, starting from King Qingwei and all the way to An'an, stood silently on the Music Fountain Square in the Association area, looking at him with a dusty and worn appearance.

"Has the revenge been completed?" King Qingwei asked.

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded slightly, "I've basically destroyed half the town. From now on, it's basically a dead zone."

As he spoke, Zhao Xu's expression turned melancholy, "From now on, there will be no more Starfall Town."

"What should we call this place then?" Aswi suddenly spoke up.

Although no one spoke up, everyone knew that the naming rights of this land were in Zhao Xu's hands from start to finish.

"Let's call it Yanan," Zhao Xu said with a hint of malicious amusement.

"What?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"A great name!" Wang Congwei immediately evaluated the name she had chosen for herself in her previous life.

"No special features!" Ai Shiyi shot back, as if struck by a needle.

Just as Zhao Xu's words faded away, a faint drizzle began to fall from the sky, like a gentle spring breeze.

At the same time, the originally dark and gloomy void suddenly cracked open, and a radiant light filled with divine blessings descended and enveloped Zhao Xu's body.

As Zhao Xu slowly lifted his head, these rays of light spread out from his side, gradually occupying this land, filling it with a warm and cozy feeling.

The voice of the magic goddess Sisilvina instantly spread throughout the vast wasteland.

["In accordance with our covenant from ancient times, we grant permission to permit the sacred land to be stepped upon, and wherever our feet tread, all shall be blessed by the divine."]
["The land of Yanshan is a sacred place."]
Immediately after, within a radius of 100 li around where Zhao Xu's feet touched the ground.

All adventurers received a new dynamic tip in their status bar - 
["Adventurer XX, you are currently in the 'Sacred Land' (Five-Ring Magic) area, which is protected by an anti-evil barrier, and spirits are scattered to gain +4 bonus. Any corpse will not be transformed into an undead creature."]
