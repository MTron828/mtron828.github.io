Chapter 548: War Magic, Annihilation of Tribes

The fog-like magic system of the "Creation" curse, which has always been a crucial system for wizards to escape and inflict negative mass effects on a group, consists of the "Hidden Fog" spell of the first ring, the "Cloud Fog" spell of the second ring, the "Stinky Fog" spell of the third ring, and the "Death Cloud" spell of the current fifth ring.

As soon as the sound of the spell left his mouth, a green-yellow fog burst forth from Zhao Xuan's hand, heavier than air, and rushed towards the target he had chosen.

Immediately, the palm of his hand burst forth like a chimney, spewing out a stream of dark mist that shot down to the ground.

In the blink of an eye, the commander of the beastman empire, who was gathering his soldiers for training, suddenly felt a thick, yellow-green fog appear on his head, like nasal mucus.

"Poison! Run away!" he shouted.

At the same time, the beastman shaman on the side also looked stunned, as if unable to understand why a cloudy fog had fallen from the sky, looking like it was bringing an "epidemic".

Even if they moved quickly, they couldn't escape the "Death Cloud" that was accompanied by a fierce wind.

The cloud of fog suddenly rained down like a torrential rain, covering every head.

"Ah!" One of the stout beastmen, who was covering his mouth, clutched his throat tightly after just a moment.

At this moment, he couldn't understand how his skin could be so painful just by touching the fog, even though he hadn't inhaled it.

Zhao Xuan poured a ball of hot oil down on the beastman army below, with countless wails and screams erupting and echoing.
Here is the translation of the text:

A weak orc warrior who was standing just outside the range of the "Death Cloud" spell, gazed at the gruesome scene unfolding a hundred paces away, and collapsed to the ground, becoming numb.

The orcs surrounding him suddenly cried out, "It's the plague, it's the Death Cloud of Tara Marama Mountain!" Others may not have been clear about what the "Death Cloud" spell was, but in the orc nation, the Death Cloud of Tara Marama Mountain was infamous - even the strongest orc warriors who came into contact with it were doomed to die.

The "Death Cloud" spell had a limited range, and Zhao Xuan had chosen to strike at the core area of the orcish army, which was where the various subordinates and officers would gather before the army set out. The orcs who were not affected by the spell all let out a terrified scream and scattered in all directions.

Not even the strictest military discipline could suppress the fear of death that had come uninvited.

Zhao Xuan was floating above the sky, watching the gruesome scene unfold below.

The Death Cloud spell was a rare and swift killing technique that could kill anyone regardless of their defenses. Its targets were divided into three categories: those with 1-3 HD (Hit Dice) would be instantly killed without any chance of survival; those with 4-6 HD would have to make a strong will saving throw to resist the spell's effects; and those with 7 HD or above would be unaffected by the spell. However, if they failed the saving throw, they would suffer 1-4 points of physical damage and would continue to take damage every round unless they left the area. Those with 7 HD or above would only suffer physical damage if they failed the saving throw.

Therefore, for Zhao Xuan to cast this spell on low-level players would indeed be a slaughter. For low-level players, the only way to survive this spell would be to have immunity to poison. This is also the power of a five-ring mage.

Even if they don't have abilities like "Extremely Effective Magic", "Twin Magic", and "Supernatural Control", they can't achieve maximum damage.

However, when these high-level magic spells arrive, they can still let out a sigh of relief.

As Zhao Xu watched the scattered beastmen fleeing, his expression remained devoid of the slightest pity.

From the moment they started wearing tattered armor and wielding blood-stained spears, they had to accept their fate of being killed.

The killer is always killed, including him.

"Supernatural Magic - War Magic: Divine Storm."
"Supernatural Control: Extremely Effective Magic, Twin Magic."

In the next instant, Zhao Xu activated his own four-ring magic position, using the "Premonition" effect to compress the original one-minute spellcasting time to "one round".

The Divine Storm, originally a three-ring divine spell, was summoned by calling upon the power of the righteous army, bringing down a pillar of rain with a radius of six meters and a height of six meters.

The rainwater presented a soft and warm power, capable of causing 4-level or higher suppression on those who listened, detected, or were attacked from a distance.

Moreover, it could deal 2-12 (2D6) damage to evil biological creatures, and multiply the damage to evil extraterrestrial beings.

The effect range of this spell is similar to that of the Death Cloud, and Zhao Xu focused on its pinpoint attack feature.

Therefore, he instantly found the "War Magic version" of this spell.

In addition to the high-level magic, an extra 1,500 gold coins and 10 bottles of 25-gold holy water were also required.

War magic is essentially an art of burning money.

However, for Zhao Xu, who possesses "Supernatural Magic", it is not a problem.
Here is the translation:

The divine storm, which was previously 6 meters in diameter, has expanded to 30 meters. Its effective range has increased by 25 times, reaching nearly 3,000 square meters.

The beastmen soldiers who had been fleeing in terror suddenly saw a blessing from the heavens, thinking it was a gift from their war god to dispel the death cloud. However, they were shocked to find that the raindrops falling on their bodies did not bring any refreshing sensation, but instead, excruciating pain. The raindrops felt like tiny needles piercing their skin.

One by one, the beastmen soldiers were struck by the divine storm, which covered them all. They fell to the ground like withered cabbage, unable to get up.

The benevolent rain, which initially dealt 2-12 points of damage, had become a deadly rain that dealt 24 points of full damage after being amplified. Even the relatively strong warriors, who were only a few levels above, were killed one by one.

Those who managed to escape the range of the divine storm were also struck by the 24-point deadly rain the next round.

The crimson ravine was drenched with raindrops, and the loss of life was like a row of dominoes falling. It was unstoppable.

Zhao Xuan was soaring in the sky, waiting for his supernatural abilities to recover. When they did, he unleashed another divine storm towards the fleeing direction.

In the end, the lush grassland, which had just begun to bloom, was filled with the bodies of the beastmen soldiers. The wolf smoke they had lit was also extinguished by the benevolent rain.

In the twilight forest, Zhao Xuan had previously used a series of magical techniques to wipe out hundreds of adventurers who had attempted to ambush him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although he had only just reached level 9, he could effortlessly wipe out an army of over 1,000 goblin warriors, each with a minimum of 1st-level fighter abilities. Even if these warriors were lined up to surrender, he would still slaughter them one by one with his heavy axe, exhausting himself after killing dozens. A thousand-strong goblin army could potentially destroy a small town without him lifting a finger. However, what was baffling was that he could wipe out the entire army with just a few spells. Even after his emotions had calmed down, his latent abilities and profession skills had already recovered. It was as if he had simply poured hot water over an anthill.

"Why is it that the gods' mental state is always so lofty?" he couldn't help but muse.

To ordinary people, the gods were nothing but ants. They could crush entire armies with a wave of their hand, yet it was impossible to inspire awe in others.

As he thought this, he continued to open the "task list" and sent a "transmission spell" to the task interface of the Guardian Organization.

The "short transmission spell" was a spell of the 4th circle of the Cleric and the 5th circle of the Mage, which only he could waste in such a way, using the spell to send a direct feedback.

Instantly, a response arrived from the other side, also a result of the transmission spell, as long as the message did not exceed 25 characters.

After scanning the message he had just received, he felt a sense of confusion.

It was "exterminate all". The content of the message told him to directly eliminate the goblin armies in the nearby tribes, and most people naturally followed the instructions of the task.

As long as Zhao Xu completes this "clearance task" once, it's equivalent to completing his annual performance. However, Zhao Xu is not an ordinary person. In addition to clearing out the orc army, he may also rise to the level of wiping out the entire tribe. He still has some doubts.

Immediately, Zhao Xu began to cast the five-ring arcane spell "Interdimensional Exploration", which requires 10 minutes of spellcasting time.

This spell allows his "soul" to transmit to a real existing interdimensional plane, such as the elemental plane, the plane of positive energy, the star plane, or the outer plane. From there, he can receive information and advice from the interdimensional gods.

The farther his soul is transmitted, the higher the probability of receiving accurate information. However, there is a risk of temporary damage to intelligence and charm during the transmission process.

Zhao Xu chose the highest-level "Outer Plane: High-Rank God" option. According to the agreement, he received a true answer probability of over 88%. However, the risk is also the greatest. If he fails to clear the task, his intelligence and charm will drop to 8 points and remain that way for five weeks.

Most of the answers are simple ones like "yes", "no", "maybe", or "approximately". However, Zhao Xu is not like that. He directly connected to the dimension of the "Magic Goddess" Sylvia.

After going to the divine kingdom, he has his own VIP hotline.

Later on...

Zhao Xu finally recovered from the interdimensional journey. He gazed at the distant location of the orc camp, a look of annoyance on his face. It turned out that the orc tribe had launched a surprise attack on a merchant caravan passing through, and a Mistral core mage was secretly embedded in the group.
Here is the translation of the text:

After that, the sorcerer was beheaded on the spot, and even the female priest who was walking by was brutally murdered. She was even subjected to humiliation. "This is a curse," Zhao Xu said.

He immediately flew towards his destination, bringing new death with him.

...Deep in a dark and eerie alley.

Most of the inns on the street were already closed, except for a small inn at the far end that was still open, lit by three white lanterns.

At this moment, a lone wanderer dressed in black nightwear quietly entered the inn, scanning the surroundings.

The bartender, who was busy wiping down the counter, suddenly stopped and looked at the wanderer with a sharp gaze.

"What's this reward you're talking about?" the bartender asked, his hands still wiping the counter.

But the wanderer whispered, "Is anyone from the 'Basaaru' tribe coming to collect it?"

The bartender shook his head, "That's impossible. The 'Basaaru' tribe has over a thousand soldiers, and even the 'Hoiel' family, who are wealthy and powerful, would not dare to send a large force to conquer the beastmen tribe across the mountain."

"But the High Ring Sorcerer's magic range is limited, and he can only repel enemies head-on. It's impossible to completely wipe them out."

"I think the family's hatred won't be resolved so quickly," the bartender analyzed, using his years of experience.

"Not," the wanderer suddenly shouted, causing the customers who were sleeping to wake up, ready to shout curses.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I just received information from the spy on the opposite side."

As he spoke, a wandering person said with an extremely terrifying tone: "Not even half a day has passed, and the bodies of over a thousand beastmen soldiers are lying on the grassland in the Bloodwood Forest."

"And not far from there is the tribe, and it's like the sky is on fire, with the entire tribe of beastmen being burned to death inside, and no one was able to escape."

"It's said that the priest of the beastman tribe, who is also the war god, came near the burnt-out graveyard, and almost fainted, as the intense stench of death inside was even frightening an evil priest who could curse the spirits."

After hearing the other person's words, the bartender who was responsible for underground tasks, despite being used to big waves and strong winds, couldn't swallow his saliva and showed an expression of disbelief.

"Clang clang."

A knock at the door suddenly echoed from the entrance hall, startling everyone who was in a state of shock.

The bartender, who had just trembled with fear, suddenly shouted at the door: "Do you understand the rules? If you have something, just come in directly."

"Sorry."

At this time, a mysterious man in a black cloak slowly walked in from outside. His entire body was covered in a black veil, and his face was also hidden.

However, what was strange was that water droplets were constantly dripping from the man's body, which was completely different from the clear night sky of the city of Oloro.

"I've heard that after completing the task, you can receive the reward here," the man said calmly, without any hint of anxiety.

When he heard that he had come to collect the reward, the bartender finally relaxed his expression, "Bring over the task proof."

"Uh? They only gave me this proof and said that's it."

Note: I've translated the text to the best of my abilities, but please keep in mind that the translation may not be perfect, and some nuances may be lost in translation.
Here is the translation of the text:

The bartender suddenly lifted a disdainful expression, thinking he had seen many scoundrels who filled out fake proof and came to claim the reward for a task. He wondered how many punches this man could take.

As he thought this, he also took the paper and froze.

【Secret Sword Alliance:

Zhilaw (code name: Lone Star) has completed the task of annihilating the "Bassalur" orc tribe. Please fulfill the reward of the Hoyle family task.

Proof: Northern Alliance of the Mage Association Branch

The seal of the association is below, which no one dares to forge.

The red ink penetrates the paper.

"Is that okay? If not, I can take you across several hundred kilometers and take a look right now."
"However, we have to hurry, otherwise they'll be finished soon."
"Besides, I'm in a hurry."

The mysterious man smiled, revealing his shiny and bright teeth, his mouth slightly open.
