Chapter 233: Slaying the Wraith

"Energy Shield!" Zhao Xu instantly unleashed this level three spell from his cleric's repertoire.

From the day he became a mage, Zhao Xu's understanding of magic had evolved beyond simply stacking numbers. The wraith's actual abilities were not limited to just "Corrosive Gaze" and "Frightful Appearance", which were mostly just damaging properties. Therefore, Zhao Xu decided to use this prepared spell to counterattack.

This spell directly granted him immunity to exhaustion, fatigue, property damage, and energy absorption. He had once feared the "Energy Absorption" ability, which would result in a demotion penalty. However, he had successfully immunized himself against it.

Wraiths were originally living beings that possessed their own profession or monster abilities. Only when they died and their strong resentment remained would they transform into a wraith and dissipate, forming this existence. Therefore, they would add the "Wraith" template to their own abilities, gaining corresponding wraith abilities.

The wraith that the Maple Leaf Team encountered last time was a low-level mage who directly unleashed "Rainbow Spray" to knock out the entire team. This wraith now saw Zhao Xu and felt some fear, as it sensed the giant scythe Zhao Xu wielded, which could harm it! The scene no longer resembled the cat-and-mouse game it used to play.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, the ghost had already recognized the priest's robe worn by Zhao Xu as the greatest threat to it. It then directly rushed towards Zhao Xu. Meanwhile, Cui Lu stood in the corner, loudly reciting the ghost's various abilities.

She didn't know why her idol, Dong Cheng Rui, had given her the template data of the ghost. This knowledge was originally supposed to be known, but it was difficult to find a channel. Many people could only rely on their past battle experiences to describe a few of the ghost's abilities. For example, adventurers who had been injured by the ghost's "Terror Scream" ability would know that it had the ability to emit a loud scream and cause fear. However, the specific scope and duration of its effects were unknown.

Dong Cheng Rui had provided Cui Lu with data that seemed to be tailor-made for the ghost, with clear and explicit information on its supernatural abilities, including its attributes and damage range. As Cui Lu read through the data, she felt a growing sense of shock.

When the ghost appeared at this moment, she was even more deeply impressed with her idol. "Attack it quickly!" Zhang Qi shouted urgently.

As a priest, Zhang Qi's girlfriend, Feng Ge, had successfully completed the "Magical Arms" spell and injected the energy ball into Zhang Qi's weapon.

Just as Cui Lu had reminded her, Zhang Qi's giant sword suddenly burst into a bright light, eclipsing the existence of the dozens of unquenchable torches. It was as if the seal had been lifted, attracting everyone's attention.

With anger, Zhang Qi shouted "Die!" and charged forward. The teammates from Zhao Xu's class, although somewhat disordered, did not have any casualties on the spot and still maintained their combat effectiveness.
Here is the translation of the text:

On the other hand, the main issue is that Zhao Xuexu has given each person 110 gold coins for the indestructible torch, which is too enticing.

Arthur, who has received training, earns only three silver coins a day, and it would take three to four days to save up one gold coin.

This is still a price that only a professional with a certain skill can afford.

As for the ghost, it didn't care at all, not even when the wizard, Mu Tong, directly cast the "Magic Missile" spell at it, and it didn't feel a thing.

Such a wizard would be terrified if there were ten more like him.

Now, everything has already gone too far.

Next, it will be up to the wizard's teammates to see if they dare to take action against it.

The ghost is flying towards Zhao Xuexu at high speed.

Zhao Xuexu, who has just cast a spell, cannot resist the ghost's "possession" ability unless he casts another spell immediately.

The ghost's strategy is extremely clear: it will first eliminate the three spellcasters in the scene, and then the people on the scene will no longer be able to cast the "Protection from Evil" spell, at which point it will kill them one by one.

After hearing Cr Li's hint, the team members saw this scene and couldn't help but feel a chill.

This "possession" ability is comparable to the "Phantom Vial" spell, which is also why Zhao Xuexu, who found it first, was able to resist it. Otherwise, no one in the scene would have been able to resist it.

Even some of the more timid ones couldn't bear to watch Zhao Xuexu being controlled by the ghost.

At the same time, the arrows finally arrived, and they fell inside the ghost's body.

Unfortunately, these arrows are not magical arrows and were not shot from a remote location, so they had no chance of harming the ghost.

This also made the players who had heard Cr Li's words look on in amazement, seeing why "magical weapons" have such a high reputation.
Here's the translation:

"What's the point of using up so many resources? With just 2000 gold coins more, the outcome of the battle may be completely different. But it's too late now. Just as the ghost was about to touch Zhao Xun's forehead...

Zhao Xun lightly snapped his fingers.

Suddenly, a powerful aura burst forth from Zhao Xun's body.

It wasn't any magical technique, but his "Protective Spirit Qi".

Combined with the powerful "Fervent God Servant" Altoria, Zhao Xun could condense the opponent's abilities with just a thought, and release them with another thought.

This ability to freely switch on and off made him incredibly free, allowing him to manipulate the ghost at will.

If he had released this "Protective Spirit Qi" earlier, a six-meter radius of "Anti-Evil Law Formation" would have been created around him, with the effects of each person's "Protective Anti-Evil" spell in addition to his own.

This would have made the area "Inaccessible to Evil", and even powerful creatures like dragons would not be able to step into the area, let alone the ghost.

As the ghost had already entered Zhao Xun's six-meter range, it meant that Zhao Xun's "Anti-Evil Law Formation" had become a direct blade facing inward.

Instantly, this rejecting-evil formation transformed into a binding-evil formation.

As long as Zhao Xun's spirit energy did not cancel out, the ghost would be unable to escape the spiritual circle set by Zhao Xun.

This was the reason Zhao Xun wanted to create the "Unending Blaze" to paralyze the ghost in the first place.

It was to make the opponent fall into his trap.

But the ghost was still unaware, wandering aimlessly in search of prey. It saw that it couldn't invade Zhao Xun's body and immediately headed towards the player Du Nan, who was closest to Zhao Xun."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just now, Zhao Xu encountered danger, and Du Nan rushed over to help him, even faster than Zhang Qi. At this moment, Du Nan's appearance was quite unflattering, with gray skin, a sloping forehead resembling a monkey, and prominent jawline with part of his canine teeth visible, and his entire body covered in coarse and hard fur. Suddenly, he unleashed the signature ability of a barbarian, "Frenzied", causing his muscles to inflate like balloons. However, the ghost was not intimidated in the slightest.

If this was all it took, warriors would have already conquered the world.

The ghost cackled maniacally and began to possess Du Nan's body. Just as it was about to invade, the same "electric shock" sensation occurred again, and it was repelled once more.

The ghost's expression changed to one of incredulity. Although it had not seen anyone use the "Protective Barrier" ability on this barbarian, it suddenly understood.

"Three-Ring Holy Protection Spell!"

Wood Qing, the wizard standing at the corner, had exhausted his magic after using the "Magic Missile" scroll, but his insight and judgment remained unimpaired. He immediately recognized the power of this spell.

This was the only spell that could protect everyone in the area, granting them the blessing of the "Protective Barrier" ability.

"Everyone, don't run away! Stay close to Wind-sir, or you'll be possessed!" Wood Qing shouted urgently.

As for everyone present, they were all filled with courage after hearing the "Three-Ring Holy Protection Spell".

Who would have thought that this ordinary-looking pastor had already reached level 5?
Here is the translation of the text:

This level of power is impressive, even in the cathedral of Winter City. The ghost itself possesses the ability to revive, which means it has undergone numerous trials. After failing to infiltrate twice, it suddenly realized that the situation was no longer under its control. As a result, it fled directly and flew towards the outermost edge without hesitation. Just as it was about to reach the 6-meter limit from Zhao Xun, a sudden, invisible force field appeared before it, trapping it. The massive counterforce pulled it back. At this moment, the ghost was finally panicked.

At this time, Zhang Qi finally reached the ghost's face and threw a sword with a white glow at it. The ghost, however, looked at Zhang Qi with a condescending expression. What a joke, a warrior like this dares to attack it? But its condescension didn't last long. An unbelievable expression emerged from its heart. The palpable fear from its soul made it suddenly want to escape for its life. It knew it had stirred up something terrifying!

As if those mine owners had told it, they were just a bunch of first-class fools. However, it was too late. When the massive energy burst forth and destroyed the ghost's body, it suddenly vanished.

"Whoosh!" The sound echoed as Zhang Qi's dual-handed giant sword fell to the ground, and he was shocked to the point where he couldn't even grasp the hilt. Along with the sword, everyone's psychological defenses collapsed, and everyone thought the same thing. How could the legendary, incredibly powerful ghost be killed by a single sword?
