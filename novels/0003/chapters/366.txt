Chapter 367: Controlling Humans

As soon as Zhao Xu saw the young man, he turned around and swept his gaze from left to right, finding that there was no one within a five-meter radius of him.

That sentence was a question aimed at him.

He couldn't help but think to himself, "Am I really growing a mocking face?"

The cavalry from the previous day had charged at him without hesitation. And the old witch who lived in the burned-down old house had also attacked him without warning.

Is there no place in this world where people can have a rational conversation?

Zhao Xu had initially chosen a relatively secluded and quiet corner, which was also close to the back door of the tavern and the windows on the edge, making it easy to escape.

Under the dim lamp's illumination, he seemed like a faint shadow, not very clear.

But his words suddenly made the tavern, which had already cooled down, instantly warm up like a sudden gust of wind from outside.

Everyone was expecting someone to stand up and scold the young man with the green robe for his unreasonable behavior.

Even many people missed the player groups that were once omnipresent in Mistral, who were fearless and willing to challenge the authorities, even though they couldn't escape their doom.

But the players who came to Frosty Town now were all on a mission, and when they encountered obstacles, they retreated quickly, even faster than the town's residents.

"I'm just sitting on my butt a bit," Zhao Xu said calmly.

At this moment, all eyes in the tavern were focused on him, but he didn't feel anything.

As soon as he spoke, the young man with the green robe immediately turned his gaze back and looked down on him like a poor, insignificant person, not worth his attention.
As Zhao Xu sat down, he felt that the adventurers who had been leaning in with their cups of wine had suddenly moved their bodies to the side, as if they were all too embarrassed to face him. The admiring glances had also changed to a scornful expression. If it weren't for the young man in the traditional Chinese dress, Yu Wei, who was still present, someone might have mocked him for being a coward.

However, no one knew that Zhao Xu was already planning his spell arrangements. It wasn't that he wanted to take action, but since he had reached an extremely high level of intelligence, his thoughts would naturally make arrangements for various possibilities.

The pub was crowded, with the young man in the traditional Chinese dress having a powerful mage behind him, as well as four bodyguards with a similar level of profession.

From their perspective, Zhao Xu could not use his area-of-effect spells immediately. Although the people in the pub saw the young man's bullying behavior and dared not speak out, the situation would become chaotic if someone took action. Therefore, it was not wise for Zhao Xu to directly cast a cloud of stench spell that covered the entire pub.

Like the bodyguards, Zhao Xu was thinking about his three-layer expansion spell "Mao You Fu's Unicorn Arrow". This spell was like a beam of light, and as a 12th-level spellcaster, Zhao Xu could already cast three beams. The spell itself ignored immunity and spell resistance, and would cause damage as soon as it hit. Additionally, it had a knockback effect.

Once the bodyguards stumbled, the surrounding pub patrons who were enemies of the same enemy might attack, including the sword squad, who would be dragged down and could only counterattack.
Here is the translation:

It can be seen from the opponent's sudden cancellation of the task contract and abandonment of the commission that they are a decisive fighter who can make quick decisions in battle.

As for that wizard, unfortunately, Zhao Xu was unable to cast the "Weak Intellect" spell that can weaken an opponent's intelligence to 1 point, which is specifically designed to target a wizard who is unable to see far ahead.

Therefore, he is analyzing the weaknesses of this wizard in front of him, thinking about what spell to use to counter the opponent.

This is also the reason why many players who start playing the wizard profession after encountering Arthur's wizard class often suffer a crushing defeat at the beginning.

As wizards, they have to master six spells for each ring, which is more in line with the original image of the wizard profession in the game.

However, true wizards, as they learn more spells, need to consider more factors when making decisions.

Although they are limited by the preparation of spells, they have begun to use scrolls as a one-time item to compensate for their lack of flexibility.

Most of the time, they still rely on fixed routes and try to adapt to any situation.

It's impossible for them to achieve the same level of flexibility as Zhao Xu.

At this moment, the young man from the capital, looking at the Sword's Fury team, remained silent, refusing to surrender to his demands, but unable to resist him.

He sneered and waved his hand at the wizard behind him, saying, "If your teammates voluntarily follow me, you won't be ashamed."

As soon as he said this, the members of the Sword's Fury team, who had secretly harbored romantic feelings for the Patroller, Rachel, held their breath and gripped their weapons tightly, not daring to speak out.

Because everyone knew that this was not a matter of personal honor, but the life and death of the entire team.

Suddenly, the wizard raised his mysterious staff and tapped it lightly.

Everyone thought he was about to attack, and they all jumped in surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

As everything was about to come to a halt, just like Zhao Xu, it was as if he was holding onto something uncomfortable, just changing his posture. However, the woman in the leather armor, Lylia, who was hard to conceal her physique, suddenly stood up straight, and the longbow she was holding onto was suddenly released and fell to the stone floor.

The weapon, which was usually cherished, was now discarded like a weed. Her eyes were filled with confusion and bewilderment as she walked past her friends, step by step.

Until she reached the young man in the blue robe, Lylia sat down beside him. The sudden turn of events left all the people in the room wondering.

According to their logic, shouldn't they be chanting spells and casting magic? And there was no exchange between Lylia and anyone else in the room.

"What kind of demonic magic did you just use?" a warrior from the team suddenly stood up, his face filled with anger, looking at the young man in the blue robe and the mage. However, his tone was not strong enough, and he didn't dare to take a firm stance.

"It's clear that our teammate doesn't want to be bothered with the consequences of your own actions, which is why you've come to visit me," the young man in the blue robe smiled, leaning back slightly and finding a more comfortable position.

At the same time, Lylia nodded in agreement, as if she was very supportive of his words. Her eyes also changed slightly.

Standing far away, Zhao Xu was also surprised by this. He couldn't imagine that he was actually in a ordinary tavern, where someone was casting the "Control of Humans" magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's no wonder that adventurers who are dry and parched with thirst and humidity are having a hard time getting their hands on the five-ring spell, and so they just randomly used it in a tavern to settle a dispute. They didn't bother to think twice about it, and although everyone at the beginning didn't notice the priest's robe on his body due to the shadow's angle, he was still quite brazen.

"Controlling humans" is also a four-ring arcane spell, and so Zhao Xun can use it smoothly when he masters the four-ring divine magic, without having to wait until level 9. The spell's duration is calculated on a daily basis.

One could say that this five-ring spell can directly bring a servant who will listen for at least a decade, but the only drawback is that this spell can only be used on "humanoid beings" and is ineffective against monsters, requiring a nine-ring "Controlling Monsters" spell.

As for Ral's not having any command at all, Zhao Xun is also aware of the reason. Because this spell is a heart-to-heart communication, unless there is a language barrier, it can only be used with simple verbal commands.

Once someone is affected by this spell, they will wholeheartedly follow the commands of the controller, except for eating and drinking to sustain their life, and will not do anything else. Therefore, after a long period of time, this spell is more likely to be discovered than other control spells.

However, the mage seems to have used a special method to conceal the "incantation" and "posture" of his spellcasting, making it difficult for the Swordsmen to determine whether their teammate was affected by the spell. In this short few seconds, no one can analyze too much.

Zhao Xun can only shake his head, thinking that a five-ring "Controlling Humans" spell, if put on Earth, would be enough to cause chaos all over the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if they are placed in Arthur, these "control" spells are not to be underestimated, and the reputation of the wizards is partly due to these spells. Commanding the heart, altering memories, is ultimately a form of "taboo".

"Alright, since your teammates are willing to sacrifice themselves to serve me, I'll spare you this bunch of short-sighted people. Hand over the thing to our clan, and take back your teammate." The young man in traditional clothing said, patting the face of the woman beside him, and laughing as he stood up.

The members of the Sword's Edge squad, especially those who had just chatted with Lysander and laughed together, were all agitated and pale, staring at this scene in shock, but unable to do anything.

Or rather, under the invisible pressure of the wizard family, they were completely unable to move.

They had indeed suspected that Lysander might be under the control of a spell, but this suspicion only led to more exaggerated speculation.

This wizard was already capable of reversing people's minds without making a sound.

In the next instant, a "phantom hand" that could replace the spellcaster and cast a "contact" spell from afar materialized under the wizard's chair, extremely stealthy and unknown to anyone.

At the same time, Zhao Xu stood up suddenly, causing the chair behind him to creak loudly for the second time.

He raised the "Super Magic Instant Launch Rod" in his hand, pointing it forward.

He wasn't sympathetic to the woman's miserable fate.
He wasn't sympathetic to the members of the Sword's Edge squad who were being controlled and couldn't retaliate.
He was just annoyed.
Anyway, tonight's auction has been disrupted, and Zhao Xu doesn't need to keep the spell for the New Year.
"Unicorn Arrow!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The tip of the smooth scepter suddenly burst with a secret energy, transforming into a trio of transparent unicorns with weak, shining horns, which flew forward as they lowered their heads, charging towards the guards who were vigilant around them.

The mage suddenly woke up, quickly surveying the entire tavern, fixedly staring at the enemies who had suddenly attacked.

However, he failed to notice that the "Ghost Hand" had silently climbed onto his back.

"Chilling Touch!"
【As an adventurer, you cast the 3rd-level touch spell "Chilling Touch" on the opponent using the 2nd-level spell "Ghost Hand".】
【The spell ignores saving throws and spell resistance, dealing 12 points of dexterity damage (3D6), causing the target's dexterity to drop to zero, rendering it helpless, duration: 12 rounds】
