Chapter 589: The Warrior Mage Who Surpasses the Warrior

"The warriors have many roles. There are those who rule the four directions with their great power, those who conquer foreign lands with their unparalleled martial arts, and those who are the elite infantry on the battlefield. Even those who are mercenaries in an adventure team, or bandits in the deep mountains, are all warriors!"

A young player dressed in full warrior attire, standing on a raised platform, shouted loudly, his voice resounding.

He was wearing a set of armor that had been polished to a shine, with a silver coating and a non-stick coating that had been applied after lubrication. The armor was made up of multiple iron plates connected by rivets and hooks, and these plates had been forged to fit the contours of the warrior's body, completely covering his physique.

In addition to the armor, he was also wearing iron gloves, heavy leather boots, and a helmet with a visor. There was no gap that an attacker could exploit.

The warrior player had lifted the visor of his helmet, revealing a determined expression. Below him, over a hundred boys were seated on the sand, completely absorbed in the warrior's instruction. Further away, many young adults who had come to rest were listening intently to the warrior's teaching, their faces filled with longing.

Zhao Xu, who had come to this place, stood silently at the back of the platform, watching the warrior's instruction with a thoughtful expression.

Even humans from Earth know that educating the next generation is important, and the Chinese people place great emphasis on preserving their cultural heritage.

In the desolate wilderness, children can spend their days learning various skills in their spare time after receiving food rations. Fortunately, the requirements for the warrior profession are the lowest, so the number of instructors and students is the largest. Zhaoxu, relying on his 2nd-level warrior abilities, was appointed to a position as an assistant instructor in the soldiers' skills, and he could teach the essentials of being a warrior every day without risk, earning enough food and stipend for his family. In fact, his family's status was even higher than his father's business on Earth. However, after a year of turmoil, with the decline of Earth's population and the gradual formation of the organization, the previously sealed borders began to open. Zhaoxu's family, who had been defeated in the struggle, left the desolate wilderness and, after a long journey of several months, arrived at the North Alliance, where they eventually settled in the town of Zhenting. At this time, Zhaoxu, looking at the armor on his warrior's body, felt a sense of nostalgia, as he had relied on this profession to support his family in his previous life. Today, he also likes to pile up explosive melee damage and become a one-punch man. In the early stages, some people were dissatisfied with why players had abundant resources and could receive large amounts of supplies in addition to their own. However, after being educated by a series of punches, no one was left unaffected.
Here is the translation of the text:

The warrior player on the stage is wearing a "full-body armor" that is a formidable weapon. He is holding a giant sword in his hands and can easily kill over 10 people, even when surrounded by a group of "farmers" like Earth humans. This is the power of the equipment provided. For example, a "full-body armor" like King Arthur's costs 1500 gold coins and provides 8 levels of defense. However, wizards are afraid to wear it because it will affect their spellcasting posture and increase the failure rate to 35%. Additionally, the 50-pound weight of the armor will slow down their movement. Compared to the 200-gold-coin armor, it provides 6 levels of defense. However, it is heavier and more difficult to move around. Each full-body armor is custom-made by a master craftsman. Therefore, in this wilderness, if you want to add a set of armor, you either have to wait for a master craftsman to appear or buy one and modify it with hundreds of gold coins. A suit of armor is worthless here, like a house. Similarly, weapons are also like cars. The warrior on the stage continues to say, "Some warriors have noble souls, willing to sacrifice their lives for their ideals. Others are extremely lowly and can kill for a copper coin, and even take pleasure in evil deeds. Maybe you will leave here, take on the roles of soldiers, bodyguards, bodyguards, or law enforcers, or go on a journey of adventure. But I hope you remember today why you became a warrior!"
As he spoke, he turned towards the rows of weapon racks behind him, where neatly arranged wooden shelves displayed a variety of weapons, freshly customized over the past two days and serving as the basic setup for the warrior training ground.

The weapons were categorized into three main types: simple weapons, military weapons, and exotic weapons.

For warriors, the standard requirement for graduation is to master all simple weapons and military weapons. Players initially mastered a large number of weapons with the system's help, but ordinary people would find it difficult to wield them effectively due to lack of familiarity.

There are five types of simple weapons, including "hand-to-hand combat" using iron gloves, "light melee" such as daggers and scythes, "one-handed melee" like wooden clubs and hammerheads, "two-handed melee" like spears and staffs, and "long-range" weapons like lightweight and heavy crossbows.

Military and exotic weapons are also categorized into four types.

Generally, physical attack professions tend to master military weapons, while spellcasters tend to master simple weapons.

In this desolate wasteland with limited resources, simple weapons that are easy to craft at a low cost are the most suitable choice.

The warrior players on the platform also took out a wooden club, easily crafted in this desolate wasteland, and demonstrated basic combat techniques.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was preoccupied with whether to switch to the 9th level and was observing this training session, hoping to gain some inspiration.

"I don't care whether you're a warrior specializing in combat techniques or one specializing in a particular weapon," he said. "I don't care how many unique combat skills you have mastered."
Here is the translation of the text:

"But if you want to graduate in my hands, there are two major conditions for warriors to meet: first, you must be proficient in using all simple weapons and military equipment, as well as being proficient in all types of armor, whether light, medium, or heavy; and you must be proficient in all shields, including one-handed and two-handed tower shields.

The second condition is that you must master a primary warrior specialization, which is also a unique profession feature of warriors. Except for 1st level, all even-level warrior levels can awaken a warrior specialization.

Listening to this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but sigh, for this is where the meaning of being a warrior lies.

Both 1st and 2nd level warriors can awaken specializations, unlike mages who only get their specializations at 5th and 10th levels. Zhao Xu, a 2nd level mage, has a super magic specialization, which is quite formidable.

Although warrior specializations are limited to the list of warrior rewards, 2nd level warriors can exchange two warrior specializations without affecting basic attacks, making it a worthwhile investment.

Therefore, the warrior profession is still popular, mainly because most physical output professions do not know how to progress or multi-class. Without any faction or faith requirements, warriors are the most suitable for all occasions.

That's why this profession is currently popular among players on Earth, as long as they choose the physical combat route and graduate as a 2nd level warrior, they will not be at a disadvantage.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu, who was carrying a dual-handed giant sword, couldn't help but smile.

It was Zhang Qi in his previous life who tricked him into becoming a warrior."
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, the soldiers on the stage continued to spread, "There are many ways to become a soldier. You can receive training from the noble army, or from local defense teams, or even attend a formal soldier academy. We're scattering the net and waiting for suitable sprouts to grow, and then we'll conduct professional military training."

"So, the soldiers you see in the outside world, most of them are elite members who have undergone military training. They're usually ordinary people who have found their profession. But if you're not naturally talented, you can only become a mercenary with inferior skills."

A brave child suddenly raised his hand and asked, "What about the soldiers from other races?"

The soldier on stage seemed to be focused on his own skills and didn't care much about other races at first, and was speechless for a moment.

Just as the awkwardness spread, Zhao Xu suddenly spoke up, "The dwarven soldiers often come from the elite squads of the dwarven kingdom, and their lineage can last for centuries. They also have typical career paths, such as dwarven defenders."

"The elven soldiers usually possess high-level swordsmanship and take great pride in it. They're naturally skilled in using long swords, short swords, longbows, and shortbows. This is their racial talent. Therefore, elves value swordsmanship and archery, and are familiar with these weapons. Half-elves are rare, and usually follow the tradition of becoming swordsmanship masters."

"The savage tribes, on the other hand, have few trained soldiers, and most of them rely on self-study and combat experience to accumulate skills. Half-elf soldiers are less common and usually follow the tradition of becoming swordsmanship masters."

Note: I've translated the text in a way that is easy to understand, while trying to preserve the original tone and style of the text.

At this time, with a giant sword slung over his shoulder, Zhao Xu, dressed like a warrior, spoke with great enthusiasm, "Warriors are skilled in direct combat, but they rely heavily on magical support. In fact, if the magical equipment is disabled, they would suffer a significant loss. Definitely, a warrior is not a mage."

"Who are you?" a warrior player on the stage suddenly asked.

Zhao Xu lightly removed his hat and walked up to the stage, bowing slightly, "I am an envoy from the Alya Federation, here to discuss an alliance with the local military district. I just received this information and couldn't help but be excited."

At this moment, the Alya elite team was negotiating with the high-ranking officials of the military district about the conditions of the reorganization and various matters.

As the actual controller of Alya, Zhao Xu had nothing to do but bring a team to the local military district to have a look around.

When Zhao Xu spoke, the crowd was electrified, although many people who knew about this matter were well-informed that the reorganization had become a foregone conclusion.

However, seeing a person from Alya, the crowd still couldn't help but be curious, privately speculating that Zhao Xu was once a legendary warrior from one of the teams in the player versus player game.

"It seems you're our honored guest, but I've never seen you before," the warrior player on the stage shouted.

"Good!" Instantly, the crowd in the audience, who were eager for a show, began to cheer.

This drama could be said to be a rare hot event in the military district.
Watching the duel between two powerful warriors would be so enjoyable!
But Zhao Xu felt a bit embarrassed, scratching his head.
He was embarrassed to tease these simple warriors.
