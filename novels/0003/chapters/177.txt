Chapter 178: The Archbishop

The Archbishop, a tall and thin man named Andy, stood in front of the bonfire, his face pale as he gazed at the man in a cloak that shone like starlight. He couldn't help but wonder what was going on.

The four companions who followed him didn't just suddenly transform into zombies after being possessed by an evil spirit. Instead, they suddenly returned to their human form, and the sound of their labored breathing filled the air.

The four young men and women who followed Andy were equally perplexed. They had just lost consciousness, but the feeling of icy coldness before they lost consciousness told them that it was not just a simple faint.

As for the mysterious man who was a mage, why was he here? Andy used a skill to make himself invisible, but the magic on his ring failed, and his figure suddenly appeared before everyone. He gently put away the "Protective Rod" he used after casting a spell and then took out the "Time Reversal Talisman". As he used his ability once a day, the fine sand at the bottom of the talisman began to flow back up to the bottle neck, slowly trickling down.

Before tomorrow arrived, when all the fine sand had flowed down to the bottle neck, this talisman's ability would no longer be effective. At this moment, Andy also felt the great power of the "Exorcism Rod". With a 20th-level mage's blessing, he could basically exorcise ordinary supernatural beings with just a glance.

Compared to other spells like "Ineffective Boundary" on the staff, Andy was too proactive.

As expected, destroying the enemy is the strongest defensive measure.

"Andy, what's going on? What just happened?" The slightly chubby young man who started it all asked directly.

Zhao Xu was also staring at Andy, waiting for his response.

Andy suddenly bowed his head and knelt down, his face streaming with tears as he cried, "I don't know what's going on. Just a moment ago, the spirit said it wanted my friend as a sacrifice, and then you all fell to the ground dead. Then I told it to bring you back. It really agreed, but in the end, you all turned into zombies and said Lisa will become like that too. I'm really sorry, I don't know what happened."

Andy, the man who was called Andy, slumped to the ground, leaning against the black bag containing animal sacrifices, with the dark-covered book that had fallen to the ground. The events that had just unfolded over the past six seconds had a profound impact on Andy, and he even spoke with a choked voice.

At this time, the four young men and women who had followed Andy were all pale and terrified, with shocked expressions.

They had never thought that they would walk the line between life and death and come back.

Just listening to Andy's words, they should have already transformed into the evil undead beings and couldn't be restored to human form. However, this was the pursuit of their tonight's ritual goal - resurrection.

At this moment, the four people couldn't help but cast their gaze on Zhao Xu, as if they had somehow understood something.
Here is the translation of the text:

After calming down, the woman with a face full of freckles looked at Zhao Xu and asked, "Sir, the spellcaster, did you stop this disaster and save us?"

Zhao Xu quickly cleared his thoughts and, being a student at Arthur's specialized academy for cultivating bureaucrats, he didn't need to waste his breath.

"Yes, that evil entity had just harvested your lives and turned you all into undead creatures. I used my magic to reverse this disaster."

Zhao Xu spoke calmly.

After hearing Zhao Xu's response, the few people present finally confirmed that they had indeed been brought back from the land of the dead. They were all stunned and lost in thought.

These young men and women, who were mostly ordinary citizens or scholars, had a life value of less than 10 HP. It was not surprising that they were killed by the evil entity in an instant.

The effect of the undead creature effect cast by the opponent was not particularly high-level. For example, a third-level cleric's "Control Undead" spell could achieve this effect, and the life values of low-level undead creatures were usually 1 HD. The spell could control zombies or skeletons equal to the caster's level, up to four times. When Zhao Xu could cast a third-level spell, he could control a team of 28 zombies.

As a result, many areas were plagued by a wave of undead, and most graveyards in rural areas were dug up. This was mostly the work of evil clerics or wizards.

Good clerics were unable to cast such evil spells, and most residents of Arthur's town did not often encounter evil clerics. As a result, the blame for the disaster of the undead often fell on the wizards.

In areas where magic was underdeveloped, wizards were not well-liked, and there were deep-seated reasons for this.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This great sorcerer, sir, we are truly grateful for your rescue. My father is a secretary at the Ministry of Justice, and if you don't mind, I would like to invite you to my home to pay my respects to you. That plump young man then regained consciousness and thanked Zhao Xu with gratitude.

The other few people also showed gratitude towards Zhao Xu, and Andy, the master of ceremonies, also regained his composure and knelt down to express his gratitude towards Zhao Xu, grateful for the rescue.

Zhao Xu looked at the people kneeling before him, recalling the time when he, as a justice official, had maintained justice and ordinary villagers had shown reverence towards him in a similar manner.

He felt a slight sense of melancholy in his heart and pointed to the people, saying, "No need to invite. The ritual that summoned the creature was from the dark side, and you should not touch it. Even if it's not clear whether this ritual summoned a devil or an evil spirit, it's certain that they are skilled at deceiving and manipulating people to harvest their souls."

However, he was certain that the entity attached to the smoke above was not strong, but it had an ancient background. Such a ritual performed by ordinary people was too dangerous.

Even for a group of sorcerers, summoning a creature from the dark side requires preparation, which is why they developed the "Binding Spell" to counter such entities.

As the sense of relief gradually faded away, the five people who had received a good education also gradually regained their composure.

They had spent a huge price, even sacrificing their own lives, but were unable to revive Lisa, that evil creature. However, the youth in front of them, although his face was unclear, had a voice and mannerisms almost identical to theirs, and was able to revive them."
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as they realized their true identity, they immediately sensed that the person in front of them was actually a priest who could perform the "Resurrection" spell. Their faces turned increasingly pale. They had been attempting to perform an evil ritual, but a benevolent priest had stopped them. This incident would never be easily covered up. If they had done this openly and honestly, they wouldn't have had to come to this remote cemetery in the first place.

"Are you a priest?" asked the woman with freckles, her voice barely above a whisper, her face filled with a mixture of fear and incredulity. She had already anticipated being expelled from school and her family being shamed in the process.

"Yes, I am a priest of the Goddess of Magic. You can call me 'Feng'," replied Zhao Xiu quietly, as he pinned the medal given to him by the Archishop of the Diocese to his chest.

The people who were not from Mistral looked puzzled when they saw the medal flashing with a special glow below the candle flame. The medal, although still in the style of a novice priest, had a new, intricate design of purple flowers etched onto its edge.

This was a mark only the Archbishop of the Diocese, the highest-ranking priest in each church, could possess. The medal of the Goddess of Magic would only shine brightly for those recognized by her. Even if a common person wore the medal of the Pope, it would only dimly shine.

This was also the reason why priests did not have to fear being impersonated.

But after seeing the opponent's large bishop-level badge behind them, my original enthusiasm cooled off by half. A female god's bishop, who didn't even need to move their hands, could have all the family's data and various connections sent to the opponent's table just by opening their mouth. They couldn't escape even if they tried to escape. At this time, the slightly plump man who held the highest status in the five-person family said with a few trembling tones: "The 'Revival of the Dead' skill of the fifth grade is unable to revive non-living beings..." The faces of the five people suddenly changed again. The 'Revival of the Dead' skill is unable to revive non-living beings, including those who have been killed by instant death spells. This means that the person in front of them had at least used the seventh-grade 'Revival' skill to revive them. The material for the 'Revival' skill is a diamond worth 10,000 gold coins and a vial of holy water, and it is also connected to four seventh-grade skills. At this moment, the five people looked at the mysterious bishop's eyes with reverence, which was their natural instinct as residents of Mistral. This proved that the mysterious man in front of them was not someone who had accumulated power through experience, but someone with outstanding abilities, deeply favored by God, and holding a high position. The five people at this time also knew that they might have met a future "Red Bishop" candidate. Such a level of person, not just in Mistral, but even in the entire Arthurian realm, is a top-notch figure, equivalent to or even higher than a king or lord. Zhao Xu saw that everyone looked at him with a stunned expression, as if he had just cast a confusion spell. Although he didn't understand what was going on, he tried to show a benevolent expression and said, "Can I take a look at that black book?"
