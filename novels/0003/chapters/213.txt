Chapter 214: Fireball

"Holy Shield" is a two-ring spell in the Holy Magic category.

Zhao Xu had once used the three-ring spell "Justice Hammer" from Holy Magic, killing the "Deep Pit Fiend" with four consecutive hammers. On one hand, it was because the opponent's material plane was weakened, and on the other hand, Zhao Xu was relying on the "Omni-Book", a divine artifact, which allowed him to deal sufficient damage as a near-20-level spellcaster.

However, none of these factors could mask the intensity of Holy Magic itself.

"Holy Shield" suddenly emitted a massive light circle enveloping Zhao Xu, causing him to constantly oscillate with a defensive ability. As soon as he was attacked by external forces, he would become as hard as a shield.

The shield provided by the spell could offer a 4-level defense to the caster in terms of defense.

The duration of "Holy Shield" is one round per level of the caster, and its effect is to provide a 5-level shield bonus, which is equivalent to the defense of a chest armor.

At the same time, he would also emit a bright light effect similar to "Daylight". This intense light was usually harmless, but as soon as someone tried to attack, they would be punished with nearly 4 levels of attack penalty.

Back and forth, "Holy Shield" effectively provided a total of 9 levels of defense, which was unlikely to be broken even by the "Fearful Spirit" at the moment.

More importantly, the only component of this spell was "Sacrifice".

Therefore, Zhao Xu did not need to chant incantations, perform gestures, or make any other movements. He only needed to sacrifice 1-2 points of strength as a payment to complete this spell.

Suddenly, the "Fearful Entwining Spirit" that had just raised its massive scythe lost all its power and was overwhelmed by the weight of the sun's rays, which felt like a crushing burden on its body. It felt an unbearable sense of fear and hastily turned around to flee in terror.

Zhao Xu watched as the massive scythe fell to the ground, his heart trembling with excitement. It was a magical weapon! Even a simple +1 magic weapon was worth over 2000 gold coins, and there were few players in the entire Arthurian player community who possessed one.

After Zhao Xu used the non-hostile "Luminous Shield" to chase away the powerful "Fearful Entwining Spirit", the over a dozen mummies seemed to be shocked and began to retreat like a tidal wave. Although they didn't fear the weakness of sunlight, Zhao Xu felt as if he was surrounded by a giant lamp, pressuring them. It was as if they had realized that if they attacked Zhao Xu, they would be suppressed by the light and have their attack success rate lowered.

Zhao Xu quickly walked over, and his surroundings became as bright as day, with all darkness, including magical darkness, being dispelled. A massive scythe magic weapon lay quietly on the bone, still exuding its subtle aura as if it was a projection.

Zhao Xu didn't feel the urge to pick it up immediately and instead used the "Mechanical Eyepiece" to examine the magical weapon. No one could guarantee that this magic weapon didn't have a curse attached to it. For example, it might cause dizziness or instant death if picked up. This effect had no meaning for undead creatures, who were immune to such effects. However, for living beings like them, it was a deadly curse.
Here is the translation of the text:

There are some extremely evil necromancers who love to curse their undead army with these cursed items, making it so that when the enemy picks up the equipment, they will be repelled.

【+1 Shadowy Scythe, Teleportation Key】
The +1 Shadowy Scythe is something Zhao Xu has already thought about.
But what is this Teleportation Key? Zhao Xu looked at the other corner with a puzzled expression, as his invisible servant had just picked up the "Teleportation Key".

What's going on? Zhao Xu turned around and, taking advantage of the afterglow of the "Fear Entwining Spirit" spell, quickly continued to identify the Teleportation Key using magic.

As the detection magic's light reflected back to the "Eye of Insight", Zhao Xu's face also turned serious.
The key in front of him was indeed a Teleportation Key, but the detection result was clear: it was a Teleportation Key of the Positive Energy Plane.
Holding it would give him 30 HP of healing every round, and after more than 10 rounds, it would trigger the interdimensional teleportation spell to directly transport him to the Positive Energy Plane.
This is not the High Plane Teleportation Key, but just an instantaneous effect item.
Unfortunately, the 30 HP healing effect could only last for 10 rounds, and now there were only 9 rounds left.
When Zhao Xu used the "Command of the Dead" spell to make the skeleton pick up the key, the key suddenly released a burst of energy, instantly destroying the undead creature.
At the same time, it also pushed back time by one round.
From now on, as long as Zhao Xu held onto this key, he would not have to worry about the harm caused by the negative energy field, and he could kill these undead creatures at ease for at least 10 rounds.
Here is the translation:

At this time, Zhao Xu was startled by the "Fearful Curse" and "Mummy" attacks, but he managed to maintain the "Shining Shield" spell for six rounds to avoid the "Fearful Curse" from taking effect again. He was essentially stuck with this huge spotlight.

The skeletons at the periphery were slowly closing in on him, forming a circle around him. This was the reason Zhao Xu was in such a hurry to investigate.

However, after noticing the difference between the two keys, Zhao Xu's thoughts were no longer on the skeletal courtyard, but were instead deeply engaged in contemplation.

Why was he so deliberately arranged to be beaten? Initially, the skeletons were crushed by the positive energy key on the spot.

Similarly, after using the "Unending Barrier" spell, the positive energy was also damaging to Zhao Xu, so he didn't notice the key at first, resulting in 30 HP of damage.

The positive energy key was designed for people who used the "Unending Barrier" spell, while the five-hit damage spell was targeting people who used the "Resistance to Negative Energy" spell.

The "True Knowledge" spell was targeting people who used the "Deception of the Undead" spell.

After using the spell, Zhao Xu would still be affected by the negative energy field, but he could deceive the undead into thinking he was one of them. However, this trick was rendered useless due to the "True Knowledge" effect, making it a waste.

At this point, even as the surrounding army slowly closed in, Zhao Xu had already started to think deeply.

The first hurdle was to remind him that "things won't exceed five" through the use of exemptions, which he had already known in advance through the "Legendary Library".

The second hurdle was to warn him to be cautious, as everything would be targeted. This left him feeling extremely perplexed.
Here is the translation:

In the end, Zhao Xu gave up his brief speculation and directly knelt down to pick up the double-handed military weapon "Giant Scythe".

Zhao Xu's professional characteristics did not include "mastering military weapons", so he would be weakened by the unfamiliarity of using this weapon, which would lead to a significant reduction in his combat effectiveness.

Then, Zhao Xu walked in front of the energy key and, just as he reached out to pick it up, he directly removed the cloak of immortality from his body.

["Adventurer Zongxia, you are currently connecting to the energy plane, gaining rapid healing 30 HP per round, with a countdown of 9 rounds (54 seconds)."]

Rapid healing 30 means that every round, Zhao Xu will recover 30 HP, and as long as he is not killed, he can basically survive for the next 10 rounds.

However, Zhao Xu did not plan to transport himself to the energy plane, so by the time he reached the 9th round, he would definitely discard this one-time magical item.

Just as Zhao Xu removed the cloak of immortality, the undead creatures that had been approaching him with hesitation suddenly surged towards him like a tidal wave.

The undead creatures rushed towards the only living person on the battlefield, desperate to devour him.

At this moment, Zhao Xu would not think that the only "Wyrm's Tooth" in the area was a rare and precious thing, and that no one could guess whether the undead skeletons had magical weapons hidden among them.

After removing the cloak of immortality, Zhao Xu felt no sense of constraint and directly ran towards the rope hanging from the high platform.

At this moment, his front was surrounded by a dense cluster of undead skeletons, including a few mummies.

Zhao Xu immediately raised his "Fireball Eternal Wand" and shouted loudly, "Fireball!"
Suddenly, a small fireball shot out from his palm, flying directly to the skull sea in front of him and landing about 6-7 meters away. The fireball technique is a long-range spell, and he basically can throw it wherever he wants in this area.

As those skeletons with bows charging towards Zhao Xu, they suddenly felt a burning wave of heat sweep past them from behind. The originally weak fireball, after landing, suddenly burst open.

The entire space was enveloped by the scorching and swift fire wave, with the 6-meter radius area filled with the wails of the skeletons. The skeletons' skeletal bodies, which were barely maintained by the power of the soul fire, were directly blasted to pieces after being hit by this powerful fireball technique, with their bodies scattered all over the ground, four-fifths broken.

In the end, Zhao Xu's eyes were met with a fiery sea of skull mountain, paved by the fireball technique.
