Chapter 601: Item Magical Pets, Hidden Consciousness

It was as if an instant had been extinguished, and this sudden sense of discomfort made Zhao Xu shudder from the inside.

This meant that the mysterious power hidden below had directly and simultaneously destroyed his 30+ assembly bodies.

Each of the peering magical eyes was equivalent to a reconnaissance drone.

It was not scary to have them explode, but it was scary that they all exploded at the same time!

Zhao Xu, who had played with drones before, knew that the only way to capture all of them was to use a "similar interference" method.

In reality, a five-ring mage would generally not waste a five-ring spell slot to detect the situation.

Considering the urgency of the next adventure, it was completely possible that the final trump card would be reduced by one or two chapters.

Therefore, most six-ring mages would not be as extravagant as Zhao Xu.

So Zhao Xu decided to splurge again.

After the potential point successfully restored his spell slot, he cast the "Peering Magical Eye" spell again.

As the 30+ assembly bodies fell into the shadows below once more.

One, two, three...

Until Zhao Xu counted to the 15th, he received the message that all the peering magical eyes had been destroyed again.

These peering magical eyes only returned to his hands, and he could see what had happened. At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes were wide with surprise.

Facing this scene, he couldn't help but furrow his brow.

"Sharp Ears Technique"!
"Eagle Eye Technique"!

Zhao Xu immediately cast two long-distance spells, allowing him to deploy these "magic sensors" to a 500-meter radius.
Here is the translation:

As soon as the spell was cast, the detector, which was originally capable of making him feel like he was there, suddenly went offline - showing that the spell effect had terminated.

Although the detector was unable to attach special magical effects, he could still see unusual phenomena within a 3-meter radius, just like there was nothing at all.

"The Secret Eye"!

Zhao Xu, who had become extremely vigilant of the dark cave below, immediately cast another spell similar to the "Spectral Eye".

However, "The Secret Eye" was more like a real-time observation camera that needed to be operated, with a form of existence similar to the "Sharp Eye" spell, which was an invisible magical sense organ.

This spell was even more effective than the "Spectral Eye", and it was the "Five-Ring Perception" spell that was focused on the biological body.

Zhao Xu concentrated all his mental energy on "The Secret Eye", and accompanied it as it explored the dark cave.

It was as if a camera was filming a horror scene, with a low-angle shot, just like in a movie. Even in the outside world, it was a ground-level shot.

However, in the cave, the deep and dark environment made it impossible to see what was in front of him.

After about 10 seconds, as Zhao Xu continued to control his "Secret Eye" sense organ, he suddenly received a strong interference, and the spell's field of vision disappeared.

It was as if he had fallen into a haze of snowflakes.

It was not terminated, but rather forcefully disrupted by a mysterious power, and it was impossible to judge whether it was intentional or not.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head, feeling that the next events would be intense.

He had already realized that he didn't need to send out "Summoned Beings" to scout ahead or continue casting detection spells.
Zhao Xu directly slapped his cloak, muttering to himself, "Have I recovered?"

However, there was no response whatsoever.

"Fine, I've had enough. If you're not going to respond to my words, I'll have to take drastic measures," he said, his tone laced with a subtle threat.

He continued, "You're saying I'm using the 'Spell of Shattering' to convert your storage into nothingness, or perhaps sending you to those depths where even divine artifacts can't withstand the heat?"

The usually precious cloak remained silent.

The guards nearby, who were normally intimidated by Zhao Xu, looked at him as if they were engaging in a fierce battle, but dared not approach him.

"It seems I won't die before crossing the Yellow River," Zhao Xu chuckled.

However, he suddenly thought of something and said, "Wait a minute, I still have two 'Return to Chaos' and 'Abandon Chaos' scrolls in my hand. I can just use them to wash away the item's magical properties and be done with it."

As soon as Zhao Xu said this, the star-studded cloak on his body began to tremble slightly and then transmitted a message to him: "Old Master Zhongxia, I've been working hard alongside you, just consider me a worthless creature and let me go, treating me like a lifeless being."

Zhao Xu shook his head and scoffed, "When have you ever seen a magical creature without intelligence?"

He paused, recalling his complicated history with the item. It dated back to when he was at level 3, when he chose to become a "Divine Scholar" and lost the abilities to use spellbooks, summoning, and copying scrolls. However, he later compensated for this loss by studying the art of copying scrolls.
Here is the translation of the text:

So Zhao Xu specifically chose "Item Conjure" at level 3 and designated the cloak he was wearing, which was worth tens of thousands of yuan, as the carrier. Item Conjure is a growth-oriented skill, similar to "Poor Vow" skills, where one can gain rewards after vowing. At level 3, Zhao Xu invested life energy, skill points, and spell slots into Item Conjure and indeed received feedback. For example, his life energy was restored by 10%, and each skill point he invested yielded 4 skill points, while a spell slot of level 2 returned a low-level spell slot of level 1. He could still use these invested skills, but once the carrier, the cloak, was gone, he would lose the invested skills and feedback.

It's worth noting that Zhao Xu exchanged one skill for the skill points that only professions and intelligence could obtain, which was not a bad deal. However, he didn't anticipate that the Item Conjure would remain dormant for the entire 7-level period, only awakening today. "At level 7, you would normally obtain 'intelligence', which usually includes 10 to 12 points of intelligence, charm, and perception. Unless there is a significant change in your faction or you are affected by a coercion spell, you will completely obey me and cannot use these attributes," he said. On the other hand, you have also gained the ability to observe everything within a 20-meter radius around you."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I understand." At this moment, the starry cloak on Zhao Xu's body also emitted a voice from within his heart. "As your sensory abilities increase, you will be able to receive assistance from your pet companion in terms of detection, just like those wizards with magical pets. As long as the pet is by your side, you will be able to receive its assistance in detection. So, you have gained a 'vigilance' skill with a 3-level increase in detection, which means that your pet companion has awakened its 'sensory' ability."

"Not wrong," Zhao Xu nodded slightly. "I thought you were suppressed by Larkness and might even be replaced, so I didn't awaken the three abilities."

"But after I reached level 7, I found that I had indeed gained the vigilance skill, so I knew you were still a normal magical pet."

"By the way, magical pets can awaken not only 'intelligence' and 'sensory' abilities but also 'communication' ability at level 7. However, since Larkness has left my body and even her 'Tome of All Knowledge' has officially disappeared, it's strange that you still don't initiate communication with me. This is quite problematic."

"So, is this the reason you've finally come looking for me after summoning the goddess's miracle using the 'Tome of All Knowledge' as a sacrifice?" Zhao Xu's starry cloak sighed.

"What do you think?" Zhao Xu shook his head.

"Are you that scared of me? Not even daring to initiate a call, you think I'm like some sort of three-headed monster. You've been living in my magical item for so long, and you still can't even say a few nice words to your host?"

At this moment, the starry cloak on Zhao Xu's back seemed to stir, as if it had come to life.

"Grandpa Summer, do you really think the things you're experiencing now are something a 10th-level wizard should be handling?"
