Chapter 133: Accumulating Power

The floating city, the highest council of law mages, is the supreme authority of the law mages' association, which is permanently stationed at the headquarters.

The council consists of seven fixed members, including the chairman Os, vice-chairman Feng, and Viren, Reno, Kassis, and Nazer, among others.

In general, these seven members decide on all matters in the floating city and even in Mistral.

However, the legendary law mages are only allowed to participate in discussions related to specific topics. For example, the Nine Rings Law Mages can only attend the meeting when it's time to vote on the agenda.

This time, the theme of the meeting is for Anzhiya to report on her recent activities and recent developments.

Anzhiya is not usually enthusiastic about attending these meetings, but this time she has agreed to attend. All seven members of the council are present and attentive, with each one projecting their image.

Just as the meeting is about to proceed, a clerk suddenly enters the room and hands Chairman Os a report on the recent developments in the floating city within the past hour. Os glances at the report briefly, familiarizing himself with its contents.

However, this time, he looks at the report for a slightly longer period than usual.

This slight difference catches the attention of at least two of the council members.

"Anzhiya, do you need to go to the Strength Testing Hall for testing?" Chairman Os suddenly asks.

In theory, Anzhiya has no need to go to the Strength Testing Hall to join in the excitement.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although the testing hall has equipped itself with the instruments required by the legendary experiment, most of them are actually just a supplementary point for the legendary wizards to share.

The emergency significance is even greater.

After all, many of the instruments also have a certain maintenance cycle. The experts and alchemists of Floating City are basically running at full capacity every day.

"I haven't done an experiment in years," Anzhi said with a furrowed brow.

"Hah, the one-hour report from the High Hall's monitoring system just came in, saying that the 10-14th floor testing instruments were opened at your request," Oss said with a smile.

For them, even if these instruments are fully loaded and about to be scrapped, it's just like that.

If it weren't for Anzhi being right in front of him, Oss wouldn't even bother asking.

As soon as Oss finished speaking, Anzhi immediately realized what was going on and smiled to herself. "It's probably that silly Zuixia who ripped up the test coupon and threw it away in the trash."

At this moment, the seven giants in the room couldn't help but shake their heads and smile.

They immediately understood that the testing hall would start all the instruments.

Definitely, Zuixia took the coupon and directly told the supervisor, "Let's try it all."

Otherwise, the legendary wizards wouldn't dare to consume resources to start all the devices on the 10th to 14th floors.

Each level up, the resource consumption increases exponentially.

"Chick, go notify Nachi, tell him we allow his research group to borrow all the facilities on the 10th to 14th floors for a day," Oss said to the secretary who had just arrived.

Once the instruments are opened, they are simply used.

Chick nodded and was about to leave when Oss added, "And send a congratulatory decree to the legend testing hall, and come up with your own reasons."
Here is the translation of the text:

The secretary's official, Qi Ce, took a moment to compose himself before nodding in understanding and continuing to leave the room.

As someone stationed at the high-level center of the association, Qi Ce received countless messages and rumors every day, earning him the reputation of being the most well-informed person.

After receiving such an award, Qi Ce became clear that some people had fantasized about replacing Li Sitan in that position, but their hopes were shattered.

...Zhao Xu was taken aback when he successfully shot the reinforced skull with an arrow and saw it explode with a high amount of damage, directly destroying the blue-glowing skull.

Initially, Zhao Xu had planned to take a look at the dynamic panel's numbers, but he was caught off guard by his opponent's sudden attack.

As a 2nd-level warrior, even many other professions at the 3rd level would not have 20 HP.

The iron stone he encountered in the gorge north of the Tian Jian mountain range would reappear in front of Zhao Xu if he was not careful.

If Zhao Xu had two rounds of preparation time, he could also blow his head off.

The first-level spell "Holy Sacrifice" applied to the arrow tip had a significant effect on low-level monsters, making them instantly die.

The only cost was that Zhao Xu's life value was deducted by 10 points from the original 13 points, leaving him with only 3 points.

Zhao Xu had to cast a "Light Wound Healing" spell on himself immediately, or he would faint if he was lightly wounded.

At this point, Zhao Xu roughly understood his combat level, which was significantly higher than that of other players due to the support of 14 first-level spells.

When Zhao Xu went to another testing room, he had already removed the Ayn stone from his head.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the first-floor novice mages, even those from mage families, few have the Erebus Stone. Even the cheapest one that doesn't require breathing can cost 4000 GP, and people would rather spend their money on copying a few more level-one spells and buying more scrolls.

The combat testing hall provides biological supplies for combat testing and basically prepares a full range of common evil creatures.

Most of them are summoned in a similar way to undead creatures, existing in a projected form. Once killed, they instantly disappear.

Zhao Xun recalled his past life's sealed-off magic war, where their region was mainly attacked by the devilish army.

So Zhao Xun killed the most evil and inferior demons and demons.

Due to his familiarity with these creatures, Zhao Xun skipped the undead region and went to the hellish region.

The setup was the same as before, with novice mages standing on the second floor and the hellish creatures in the underground pit, with a protective barrier to prevent them from escaping.

Zhao Xun chose the "inferior demon" testing room this time.

There were already a few novice mages in the room trying out, and they didn't pay much attention to Zhao Xun when he entered.

Suddenly, the entire floor shook slightly, and the protective barrier separating the inferior demons seemed to fade away.

It took several seconds for everything to return to normal.

Confronted with this scene, the few novice mages looked bewildered and quickly ran outside to see what was going on.

There was a legend about a mage who, during testing, had the barrier containing the evil creature suddenly disappear, resulting in the testing mage being torn apart.
Here is the translation of the text:

After using the revival spell to bring back the mage, the opponent left behind a massive psychological shadow and directly flew away from Floating City. Zhao Xia did not pay much attention to it, and the protective staff in his pocket was still there. If a high-level demon appeared, he would not be at a loss. Zhao Xia did not move, continuing to observe the inferior demons below.

As he had seen in his past life, these inferior demons were like a disgusting meatball, with no brain, only able to follow the instructions of high-level demons. They were extraterrestrial beings with about 10 HP, but their skin's defensive ability was not bad, comparable to that of ordinary armored humans.

For various professions, mages and priests, who are practitioners of magic, are indeed the most in contact with demons and demon armies. This is also the reason why the battle testing hall sets up these testing rooms.

Zhao Xia decided to test his new abilities. One day, he accidentally met Lin Qi in the library, who briefly introduced him to the virtues of a virtuous and pious life. This ability was similar to the dark knowledge of the scholar of the ancient tome, and Zhao Xia immediately saw a hint on the dynamic panel, indicating that he could exchange it. However, he was still stuck in the upgrade of the ancient tome at the time and did not bother to look at it.

This time, Zhao Xia reopened the dynamic panel to view it again.

Knowledge and virtue are indeed a specialization, obtained at the cost of giving up knowledge fields.
Here is the translation of the text:

The role of the knowledge domain is to allow Zhao Xu to regard all knowledge as his professional ability. However, as a wizard, Zhao Xu already possesses this ability, and the knowledge domain can only grant him a limited effect, such as increasing his spellcasting level by 1 when casting prediction-type spells. After some thought, Zhao Xu decided that trading the knowledge domain for "Knowledge Devotion" specialization would be more beneficial to him.

He immediately agreed to give up the knowledge domain and obtained the "Knowledge Devotion" specialization. The ability and domain spells on his priest list disappeared, but he had already mastered the spells in his arcane schoolbook, so he didn't suffer any losses.

After exchanging the ability, Zhao Xu looked at the infernal creature in front of him and checked his character panel for the "Knowledge Devotion" specialization. As an otherworldly being, the infernal creature corresponded to domain knowledge, and Zhao Xu directly activated his ability to perform a knowledge check.

[Summer Adventurer, knowledge (domain) ability check, result = 7 + D20 (1-20) = 17, within the 16-20 range, gaining +2 insight bonus to attack and damage against the infernal creature.]

Subconsciously, Zhao Xu felt that he had a deeper understanding of the infernal creature's movements, and it seemed slower in his eyes.

Although it was not as powerful as his "First Strike" ability, which granted a +20 insight bonus, this effect still increased his attack power by nearly 10%, equivalent to a 2-level increase in attack power. As long as he was facing the infernal creature, he would always have this effect, not just a one-time bonus.

In contrast, warriors typically need to level up by 1 to increase their attack power by 1 level.
Here is the translation of the text:

In his previous life, Zhao Xu was stuck at level 2 for a long time due to the enhancement of warrior's attack power. Later, when he wanted to upgrade to level 3 warrior, he practiced wielding the double-handed giant sword every day, and after countless repetitions of sword attacks, he finally grasped the secret of level 3 attack.

As for the legendary 20th-level warrior's 20th-level attack secret, what is its true power? He also applied the "Crush the Enemy" ability to himself and managed to grasp a hint of it.

However, the "Crush the Enemy" ability could only grant him the basic attack ability of a 20th-level warrior for one hit, and then he would return to his normal state, even weaker than a 1st-level warrior.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu continued to unleash his dark knowledge (tactical) ability towards the inferior demon in front of him.

[Adventurer Summer, knowledge (plane) ability assessment, assessment result = 7 + D20 (1-20) = 26, exceeding DC15 difficulty 10 points, increasing attack power against the inferior demon by 2 levels, lasting 1 minute, twice]

As Zhao Xu had expected, the knowledge and dark knowledge abilities combined perfectly.

He gained a 4-level advantage in attack power over the inferior demon, and in an instant, he eliminated the demon's natural defense.

Without hesitation, Zhao Xu picked up the light bow in his hand, aiming at the inferior demon in the distance.

To upgrade to level 4 attack, one would need to upgrade to level 4 or increase strength by 8 points or equip a +4 magic weapon. None of these options are easy to achieve.

Zhao Xu triggered the mechanism, and the inferior demon instantly turned to dust.
