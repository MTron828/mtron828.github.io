Chapter 43: The Temple

After this exchange, Zhao Xu roughly understood the casual tone of Lei An's language.

"You're not going to pretend that you actually hit Anzhi Noya, are you?" Lei An said.

Zhao Xu shook his head, knowing himself.

Moreover, he could sense that Lei An's tone was off.

Anzhi Noya, after all, could also cast the "Rainbow Law Ball" spell and defend against a single attack.

"Good thing you're not like me," Lei An said, suddenly lost in thought. "I thought I really hit my master back then, and I was overjoyed for a long time."

Zhao Xu felt awkward suddenly, and it sounded like a clich√© from some anime.

"In fact, when facing Anzhi Noya, you can't even cast any spells. As a mage, we can perform 'Counter Spell' and maintain a high level of suppression over players like you. However, I'll explain the details later after you've undergone 'Spell Recognition' skill training."

Then, Lei An directly brought him to the underground city of Mistral.

This was Zhao Xu's second time setting foot on this real land of Arthur in half a month.

He took a deep breath, feeling the air of the land and finding it had a different flavor.

The Temple of the Goddess and the Church of the Sacred Heart were adjacent to each other.

The Temple was the previous residence of the Goddess before she ascended to godhood, and it was expanded and renovated.

The Church of the Sacred Heart, on the other hand, was built next to it, with daily church affairs conducted within its inner hall and the outer hall reserved for believers to pray and worship.

The headquarters of the Mage Association and many research institutions were located in the floating city above.
Here is the translation:

The entire temple and church occupy a vast area within the city walls. Even Mistral, this city, began to expand from this point as its center, radiating outward like a star. As the central location for believers, the outer courtyard of the Holy Heart Church is bustling with people. When Zhao Xu first arrived here, he felt the atmosphere. This time, he returned to find that the crowd was even more dense, making it impossible to move forward. Logically, churches tend to be busiest inside, but surprisingly, the outer perimeter was already this crowded.

"It's the goddess's birthday," Lei An explained. "That's why."

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.

In their past life, their family lived in the harsh northern region, where most residents worshipped the gods of justice and war. On the goddess's birthday, local churches would send blessings to believers. The most popular items were the holy water, which normally cost 25 GP and was only available for purchase. On this special day, the holy water was given away for free, so it was only natural that people would fight for it.

However, living in the southern region, the residents of Mistral were like those in the capital cities of other countries. They were well-off and lived a comfortable life. Even a glance at the crowd before us showed that many people were wearing fine clothes, not like they were from a poor family. The roads leading to the city gates were even restricted, with carriages not allowed to enter.

"The goddess may descend upon the altar on her birthday," Lei An explained. "So, today is a good day to receive the goddess's blessing and officially become a pastor."

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat when he heard this.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although he thought that the opportunity to become a 1st-level priest was 99%, he didn't want to give up the last 1% of the gap. Arthur's priests generally have two routes.

The first route is to cultivate from a young age as a priest, studying the divine teachings in a local church and undergoing some vocational training. Then, wait until the divine feels sincerity and directly step up from an apprentice to a 1st-level priest. If we say that the route of a wizard apprentice is first difficult and then easy, then the route of a priest apprentice is first easy and then difficult.

Many people at the wizard apprentice awakening ceremony, including Zhao Xu, succeeded. However, for priest apprentices, there are many high-level individuals waiting in line for the divine to recognize their sincerity, since the number of priest positions is limited. Otherwise, it would be easy to have a priest and directly become the strongest force on the continent.

Another route to becoming a priest is to gain the divine's favor and be directly chosen as a priest. People who take this route usually just go through a brief training and acceptance.

Therefore, Zhao Xu was confident that he could complete his priest training within a week.

He also felt a sense of accomplishment. His wife, who was also a human from Earth, was recognized by the local goddess of fortune, Bela, and received training as a priest apprentice. However, she failed to become a formal priest after two years and ended up marrying Zhao Xu, who was then a magistrate in the town, after his parents intervened.
Here's the translation:

If I hadn't crossed over to this world, I would have been a member of the nobility, born into a prestigious family. I would have never been able to get close to someone of that caliber. Even now, I don't have a way to notify them. But one day, I'll make sure my name is chanted by the poets of Arthur.

"Ah, Brother Li, why don't we just teleport in?" Zhao Xu's expression returned to normal as he looked at Li An, who was still calmly waiting in line. "Will the Will of the Academy come in through the main entrance?" he asked.

"The Will of the Academy has arrived through the main entrance," Li An replied with a bad attitude. "You can become a priest and teleport in, but I can't."

"What do you mean you're not a priest?" Zhao Xu asked.

"What's the point? Anyone in the Association can be a priest, but I, as the Association's liaison officer, can't. Otherwise, I would be the liaison officer of the Association and the Goddess Church at the same time," Li An said with a scowl.

Zhao Xu's expression changed as he suddenly realized his mistake.

In his past life, he had risen to the upper echelons of society in the city, but he was still far from reaching this level of grandeur. Any lord could crush him at will.

"Even the liaison officer shouldn't be so slow," Zhao Xu said with a scowl.

"Hey, I'm like a big shot, even on Earth," Li An said with a nonchalant tone. "No need to mention privilege, but basic etiquette is still important."

"I notified them beforehand, but who knew the church would have some issue today, causing such a delay," Li An explained. "Usually, I'd just barge in or use a spell to clear a path, but today being the day of the gods, I dare not."

Just then, a middle-aged priest in white robes walked out.

The believers around him noticed the priest and instinctively parted to form a path. The crowded entrance of the church, which had been packed like a dumpling, suddenly cleared a path three people wide.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Mr. Le'an, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting." The pastor slightly bowed his head in apology.

"It's okay, let's hurry in. It's time for the young man to become a pastor," Le'an said nonchalantly, pulling the cassock of Zhao Xu as he walked forward.

Zhao Xu was wearing a cloak, identical to the one worn by An Ti Nuo Ya, with his entire head shrouded in shadow, blocking the view of the curious crowd around him. The pastor glanced at Zhao Xu and nodded slightly, then said, "Please follow me."

As they walked, Zhao Xu and the pastor hurried to keep up. Who knew whether slowing down two steps would result in being enveloped again?

The exterior walls of the Holy Heart Cathedral were adorned with bas-reliefs depicting divine miracles.

In front of the main door, the stone steps were not the usual square stone steps, but a half-arched stone pillar on the side, as if half-buried in the ground.

After the two of them walked past, Zhao Xu also followed suit.

Suddenly, he felt his head go blank.

At this time, the sound of bells from the cathedral's altar hall floated out, one wave after another.

"Praise God," the middle-aged pastor quickly lowered his head, muttering a silent prayer.

The surrounding crowd also began to lower their heads in prayer, while some even knelt down in devotion.

"God has descended," Le'an whispered.

Zhao Xu was bewildered, his mind filled with... seemed to be some sort of magical powers?
