After defeating countless monsters, Zhao Xu has gained a profound understanding of them. The static panel displays information such as life value, action speed, defense level, basic attack, and attack methods. Any monster can be evaluated based on this information. However, further examination is needed to reveal its "special features".

For example, the demon before him has the following characteristics: 10% damage reduction, 20-meter dark vision, immunity to electric shock and poison, acid and fire resistance, and a 22-point spell resistance. It also has a 30-meter telepathic range and knowledge of true magic.

Similarly, the demon's abilities are well-equipped. Its special attacks include the "Cursed Light" and the ability to summon evil spirits. Zhao Xu has also prepared for the possibility of the demon using a "Divine Disruption" spell.

In his mind, Zhao Xu has mentally prepared for the demon's attacks and is cautious not to underestimate it. However, he is puzzled by the demon's behavior, as it seems to be a refined and noble existence, unlike the ordinary monsters. Zhao Xu is aware that using magical items is not unique to players, and he is prepared for any eventuality.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, the three passersby clashed in a fierce battle, with a hint of strangeness to it. As the mesmerizing devil, the devil of destruction, and the war devil swarmed in, the judges of the underworld, although their strength was not as formidable as those of the judges of the underworld, were unable to withstand the sheer numbers and were entangled in a fierce battle.

Despite possessing spells such as summoning lightning, high-level dispel magic, slow magic, and high-level teleportation, as well as evil spirit light, the judges of the underworld relied on their own biting and clawing attacks.

At this moment, the vast stone path that could accommodate the physical body of a demon began to tremble, as if seismic waves were being transmitted from the ground.

"Wow..."
After Zhao Xu removed his dizziness, Airen quickly shook off his negative emotions and plunged into the battle.

The relatively slender devil of destruction, who had just stepped forward, was immediately struck by the hard, massive arm of the judge of the underworld and sent flying, with his wings unable to flutter and crashing into the wall.

"Captain, these judges of the underworld are very strong, aren't they?" Airen asked in surprise.

These judges of the underworld, whose battle was also very thrilling, fought with a ferocity that bordered on madness, and their combat skills were unmatched. However, they were ultimately limited to physical combat.

Kalu also slowly came to her senses, hearing the two's conversation and hastily raising her ears to listen.

She realized that the hawk-headed devil, the frog-like devil, and the robust devil that had suddenly appeared were actually the judges of the underworld summoned to attack them.

However, before she could even say anything, she turned around and attacked the original master, clearly at the behest of the handsome man standing beside her.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This unconventional method of upending the heavens has gone beyond her cognitive scope," she thought to herself. Her longing for him grew even stronger, and her eyes, filled with tears, gazed at Zhao Xu's eyes.

"'I may not be strong against you, but I'm absolutely fatal to you two,' Zhao Xu said. 'So I've given up on letting you try because this has exceeded your level as a 1-star novice.'"

"'What level are you talking about? I'm confident in my swordsmanship with this long sword in my hand,' Lin'er proudly declared, looking up at the distance with a defiant expression.

"'Ah, I should have arranged for you to become a saintly warrior,' Zhao Xu smiled wryly.

"'Arrange?' Lin'er looked puzzled and turned her head.

"Zhao Xu noticed that he had revealed too much and changed the subject, saying, 'If you really go up against these soul-avenging demons, you'll find that you're actually getting weaker and weaker.'

"'So a better way is to use the evil creatures to target these evil demons,' he said, pointing to the front.

"'Just a moment ago, the dizziness you felt was caused by the soul-avenging demons activating a 20-meter range of cursed light and supernatural abilities,' he explained.

"'These evil demons also have a 6-meter radius of light ring around them - it's from the 'Evil Spiritual Light' ability of the Eight-Ring Protective System of Evil Elements,' he said.

"As he spoke, Zhao Xu used the two-ring spell 'Quick Medicine' he had used earlier, transforming the 'Secret Visual' spell that only affected himself into a 'Medicine' component, and then handed it to the two of them.

"'Drink it, and you'll see what the world looks like through the eyes of a mage,' he said."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Zhao Xu spoke with an alluring tone, neither Ling'er, who was already convinced by Zhao Xu, nor the cautious Lu Yujia, hesitated for a moment to drink the medicine water with bubbles and a bluish color, which was emitting a sweet smell like orange soda.

As soon as Ling'er finished speaking, she suddenly covered her mouth with her hand, looking at the world in front of her with an expression of surprise.

Zhao Xu's heart was filled with astonishment.

Is it really that exaggerated?

The detection magic of the Zero Ring and the three-ring secret law are both self-cast spells that can only be used by themselves.

Therefore, Zhao Xu couldn't cast a spell on the two of them, and only achieved it through the medicine water.

However, the detection magic is still a powerful spell of the Zero Ring, and Ling'er had really forgotten all about this wonderful phenomenon?

There was no such beautiful memory?

At this moment, both their eyes felt a burning heat, and their pupils emitted blue light at the same time, collecting the magical aura within a 36-meter radius.

Thanks to the powerful three-ring spell, they didn't need to maintain their focus like they would when casting "detection magic", and they could quickly identify the position and intensity of the magical aura.

In an instant, various brightness levels of magic decorations appeared in front of them, linked together like a chain.

"This is the world of magic, isn't it?" the two of them couldn't help but exclaim.

Zhao Xu also smiled slightly at this moment.

When he first entered the storage room filled with magical items, he also had this feeling.

It was as if he had witnessed the birth of life.

After obtaining the "secret law vision", people were like wearing a "red infrared night vision" in a pitch-black night, and even the smallest creatures couldn't hide their magical eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, amazing! I've maintained my focus and can see these demons themselves, whether they have magical abilities or not. It's incredible, and all demons have it! And the intensity is not low either!"

"Anyway, team leader, the world you saw is like this," said Xuanyuan at this moment, sighing.

But Lu'er finally reacted, but she didn't even know the name of the person who had saved her life, let alone how to approach him.

"Well, don't just stare, take a good look at what's happening. If you're right, I can let you use the permanent maintenance spell to enhance this magical ability," said Zhao Xu.

"Really?" Xuanyuan couldn't help but be overjoyed.

Meanwhile, Lu'er also wanted to say something, but she subtly understood that this handsome savior was referring to "you" rather than "you two".

Even Xuanyuan was constantly clapping her hands in excitement, but she didn't know what kind of trouble it would take to do this.

"Secret Vision" is a spell that can only be used by oneself.

The list of spells that can be permanently maintained by "Magic Maintenance" includes three categories: "can be used by oneself", "can be used on others", and "can be used in a specific area".

Among them, "Secret Vision" also falls under the category of "can be used by oneself".

Therefore, a person must be a five-ring wizard to permanently maintain "Secret Vision" by first using it on themselves and then using "Magic Maintenance".

Without any of these steps, it's impossible. Xuanyuan, as a high-ranking wizard, cannot use this method to achieve it before mastering the transdimensional spell.

To let Xuanyuan bypass this "limitation", it's not easy, but Zhao Xu had a plan.

His gaze fell back onto the "Storage Ring" on his own hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, relying on the "Wisdom-Granting Sutra" and the ultimate scroll, possessed a vast list of magical abilities, so he didn't need to rely on others for cross-table magic. Moreover, his potential points also resolved the issue of endurance, allowing him to use 14,440 magical abilities in a single day without ever reaching the point of exhaustion. As a result, he didn't need to rely on the endurance of the "Storage Ring". Therefore, he had to resort to using the inner ring of the "Storage Ring" containing the eighth-grade magic "Higher Speed Explosion".

However, the bug of the "Storage Ring" went beyond this. He could wear two "Storage Rings" on his son, one activating "Secret Law Visualization" and the other activating "Magic Constant Art", perfectly avoiding the limitation of only being able to cast magic on himself.

The loophole in the magic restriction was that it could be exploited. It was clear that his son, Yuan'er, was also extremely eager for this power. She concentrated all her attention, her eyes wide with excitement, and observed intently.

"It seems that the surrounding aura of these judgment demons is actually a 6-meter-range light ring, all of which are black and evil abilities."
"Although it is also a defensive power, it still makes people feel uneasy," Yuan'er analyzed.

"And what else?" Zhao Xu asked again.

"This kind of dark and evil power surrounding these spellcasters, I guess, can allow them to receive the power of hellish good-behaving creatures, which can enhance defense or immunity."
"And isn't the brightness of this radiant light a bit blinding, like that 'Evil Radiance'?" Yuan'er speculated.

"No, it's correct," Zhao Xu also didn't expect that Yuan'er had actually guessed the source of some magical abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the Eightfold's sacred art of illumination, each faction has its own, just like our benevolent faction can also cast the Eightfold sacred art 'Divine Illumination'."

"You can think of this as being related to the original Eightfold art 'Repel Evil', and even the effects of the spell are similar."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he quietly took out an Eightfold sacred art scroll "Divine Illumination" and began to recite the incantation in celestial language—

Divine Illumination.

Instantly, a brilliant and holy light descended from the sky, enveloping them and protecting them from harm, allowing them to resist the dark magic spells cast by evil creatures.

"Ah? Is this really Eightfold magic?"

"Good heavens? I'm really enjoying this?"

Allow allowed herself to excitedly touch the power of the holy light surrounding her.

She suddenly felt that the power surrounding her had also awakened a "blinding" level of magical light.

As for Lù Yu, she was frozen in place, looking like a wooden chicken.

Although she had never really touched on the game "Arthur" before, after crossing over, she had somehow learned about the market trends from her companions.

A "Divine Illumination" scroll worth over a thousand gold coins was used so nonchalantly?
Adding some more money, you could exchange it for a "+1" magical weapon!
You know that in this barren wasteland where the sky is dry and the earth is barren, the price of a magical weapon is many times more expensive than outside.

It's not an exaggeration to say that they are like "super cars" from the Earth world.

But who would have thought that this man who looked so ordinary would just casually use it to make them feel it for themselves?
Here is the translation of the text:

"If the other party is casting their own magic, she can still understand, after all, the strong can be capricious, just like encountering a top-level Arthurian strong character.

But this is just a joke!

It's not like losing one's family fortune.

In the past, on Earth, I bought a Louis Vuitton bag, and the various accessories didn't even raise an eyebrow. When I first saw someone burning Arthurian gold coins, I felt a sense of sadness.

But she didn't expect that this was actually Zhao Xu's cost of teaching in person, which was part of the basic teaching expenses.

"Thinking about these evil spirit lights, besides providing a 4th-level shielding and defense, they can also cast spells on good creatures and obtain 25% magical resistance. However, this significance is not significant, after all, the opponent themselves also have 22 points of magical resistance."

"The more practical thing is that this spell can also block heart-influencing and possession magic, just like defending the good."

"And once you hit these monsters, you'll receive 1-6 points of physical damage. Given your current strength, you'll really be able to break through the opponent's defense, and you'll be knocked out in no time."

"Magic has magical resistance, attack has strength, but don't solve these two points, and you'll be powerless against these judgment demons."

Zhao Xu explained, "Of course, you now have the Holy Spirit Light, which has the same effects as the previous points. However, if the evil creatures attack you, you'll be blinded, not physically harmed."

"That's okay, if it's you, how would you handle these judgment demons?"
