Chapter 028: Awakening Hall

Zhao Xu didn't explain much to Zhang Qi until the second day when he logged in the game himself.

He didn't tell Zhang Qi that he had already completed the copying of zero-level magic, equivalent to entering the first tier of player wizards.

According to Zhang Qi's loudmouth, everyone in the class knew about Zhao Xu's progress, so he would have to face everyone's ridicule.

Zhao Xu's only action was to pat Zhang Qi on the shoulder and tell him to play well.

The revival stone was a tuition fee given by players to Arthur, and no matter how good Zhao Xu thought it was, Zhang Qi still had to pay the tuition honestly.

On the second day, Zhao Xu logged in and found that Anzhen Nuoya was there as usual.

It was as if yesterday's sudden disappearance was just a special situation.

At this time, Zhao Xu had already chosen the three first-level magic spells he wanted to learn: defense against evil, seven-color spray, and magic missile.

Anzhen Nuoya smiled lightly when she saw Zhao Xu's choices and said, "The value for money is quite good. You players are indeed very perceptive."

It's not wrong for zero-level magic, first-level magic, and other spells provided for players to choose to learn. These spells had been discussed on the forum before.

All wizards of zero-level magic will learn them all, and if they learn them all, they can adjust their intelligence values to obtain additional first-level magic spells.

Then, it depends on how they obtain second-level magic spells. It's up to the wizards themselves to figure it out.

This has led to the fact that Arthur's first-level magic is no longer a secret, but as for second-level magic, the forum's magic list starts to show gaps, with some only knowing the names, but not the effects.

Analyzing the intensity of various zero-level spells and one-level spells has also become a popular offline hobby for many novice mages who cannot copy zero-level spells.

Looking at Anzino's expression now, he has selected these recognized powerful spells from the forum, and they won't be far off.

"Ah, these one-level spells I have prepared scrolls for, and you can directly copy them from the scrolls."

Saying this, Anzino pulled out three scrolls from thin air and handed them over to Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu took the scroll, which was made of high-quality paper, similar to what he had touched before.

The scroll is 20cm long and 30cm wide, with fine lines fixed at both ends, and it looks like a scroll from an ancient drama. However, the scroll itself records magical scripts, which will disappear once used to cast a spell.

One scroll can record one or multiple spells, with a maximum of six.

"Teacher, why are you giving me scrolls instead of spellbooks?" Zhao Xu wondered.

The scroll itself is a backup spell slot that allows players to directly cast spells without consuming spell slots.

If a player has a large number of scrolls, they can be considered a self-sufficient, unlimited-range artillery. Unlike mages who are initially one-hit wonders.

However, mages can still copy spells from spellbooks without needing to copy them from scrolls.

Even a single scroll costs 25 GP, which is cheaper than copying fees. However, it's not as convenient as using spellbooks for free.

"Since it's just a few gold coins, I'll have to go out of my way to get a spellbook for you, which is too tedious. These scrolls will do," Anzino said nonchalantly.

Listening to his words, Zhao Xu could only accept it silently.

Having money is like being the big boss, and it's even more true for someone who can create 25,000 gold coins without any effort.
Here is the translation:

Before you copy these scrolls, I'll give you a piece of advice," said the venerable master. Zhao Xu hastily perked up his ears and listened carefully to the master's words, which were essentially a review of the basics of magic taught by the academy to these freshman students.

"There are no useless spells, only useless mages," the master said with a serious tone.

"This is a load of nonsense, forget it," Zhao Xu thought to himself.

Zhao Xu hadn't even finished pondering the depth of the master's words when he was suddenly struck by the next sentence.

He wanted to say that this was a contradiction, but he still took a moment to think about the master's words.

"Some spells are just a waste of time and resources, created by mediocre mages who don't know what they're doing. We mages, on the other hand, should strive to find the strongest and most suitable spells from those ancient tomes."

Zhao Xu nodded silently, then returned to his desk, applied the stimulating ointment, and began to copy the spells in the manner of a true master.

Compared to copying the zero-level spells with ease, the first-level spells required everyone to be cautious and diligent, and many people had already learned most of them in just two days.

The other party, who was naturally gifted with exceptional memory, had given up on the extra bonus level of magic due to his high intelligence quotient.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was not concerned with speed; he believed that steady progress was the best.

No one knew that the training academy was actually the most comfortable and peaceful place in the entire kingdom. He couldn't bear to leave.
Here is the translation of the text:

The 1st-level specialization of a character is not a prerequisite for a profession, so some players do not hurry to determine their specialization immediately and instead plan to decide based on their needs during the adventure.

Zhao Xu is different, he will not step out of Mistral's door without mastering four powerful specializations.

For the next week, Zhao Xu spent every day copying 1st-level spells.

However, after completing the copying, he did not receive any divine intervention, a characteristic of the main character template.

Later, Zhao Xu asked Anzhen about the inside story of the eight trigrams, and confirmed that even if wizards research spells, they may not have divine intervention, let alone simply copying and learning someone else's spells.

At this time, talented players who chose the wizard class also began to appear one after another.

Until the second week had just passed, Zhao Xu had just completed copying all his free 1st-level spells.

At this time, the number of 1st-level wizards had reached over 100.

Zhao Xu had three intelligence adjustment values and received three free spells and copying from the Wizard Association.

This time, he consulted with Anzhen and chose the wizard's armor, weakening ray, and teleportation spell.

The first two spells were okay, but the last one was a secret spell that was not listed in other players' learnable spells. Only Zhao Xu, who had a private mentor, could obtain it from his mentor's collection.

According to Anzhen's words, this spell could be considered a form of teleportation spell in certain situations.

Finally, Zhao Xu's spell list in his mind stabilized, and it would not change until he obtained new spells or upgraded his spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zero-level Magic: Enhance Resistance, Acid Splash, Toxicity Detection, Magic Detection, Read Magic, Disorienting Spell, Illuminating Spell, Flash Spell, Luminous Spell, Ice Ray, Illusory Sound, Crushing Blow, Fatigue Tendril, Mage's Hand, Repair Spell, Telepathic Transmission, Switch Spell, Secret Mark

First-level Magic: Evil Warding, Seven-Colored Spray, Magic Missile, Mage Armor, Weakening Ray, Shape-Shifting

"Are you ready?" Anniya looked at the last page of the "Shape-Shifting" scroll and said.

"What's ready?" Zhao Xu looked puzzled.

"Bring you to become a mage."

Hearing these words, Zhao Xu's usual tired and numb feeling suddenly disappeared, and he finally felt energized.

"Teacher, let's go. I don't have anything to pack."

Zhao Xu quickly stood up, a poor and lonely person with no fixed abode.

Even for mages, he was familiar with the concept of carrying a spell book that was like a fire that would burn his hands off.

As Anniya didn't move to open the dormitory door, Zhao Xu thought she was waiting for him to take the lead, and he hurried to open the door.

Suddenly, Anniya's body flashed and appeared in front of Zhao Xu, followed by her white hand reaching out from her sleeve and grabbing Zhao Xu's collar.

Fourth-level Portal!

With no need for any posture, just a spell, the target could be transported to any location within the magic distance. This was the weakened version of his Shape-Shifting spell.

However, Zhao Xu didn't have time to think about it, as he felt his collar being grabbed, and suddenly he felt a pulling force.

This feeling was familiar to Zhao Xu, as it was similar to what he experienced during teleportation.

He felt he could resist the effect of this spell on him.
Here is the translation:

However, he was facing his own mentor, and he was about to be killed by himself, so he didn't need to be so complicated, just a fireball coming, and even Zhao Xu would be gone.

So Zhao Xu also put down his resistance and followed the guidance of the magic.

This year, if you want to grasp big things, just hold on and don't always think about the east and west.

Suddenly, in a small, unassuming room in the Floating City, two figures disappeared in a flash of light.

When Zhao Xu came to his senses again, he found himself standing in a large hall like a theater.

In front of him was a silver throne-like chair with a metal sheen, and around it was a magic inscription that seemed to be carved directly onto the surface. Even if Zhao Xu had learned magic for a few days, he would still be confused.

Behind him, a staircase of seats was arranged in a tiered structure, and if it weren't for the empty and bright surroundings, Zhao Xu would have thought he was in a luxurious cinema.

The seats on the stairs were already occupied by many people, with the front half of the seats fully occupied.

"What is this?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It's the awakening ritual of the magic masters," Anzhen explained.

"The entire Mistral and these Floating Cities are protected by legendary magic, which limits the use of magic by outsiders. If your identity has not been injected into this legendary magic, then these novice magic masters will not be able to successfully cast magic in Mistral."

"So, the awakening rituals in other cities are simple, with a new magic master awakening one by one. However, Mistral needs to modify the lock every month, so it must hold a 'magic master awakening ritual' every month."

Zhao Xu finally reacted, realizing that the people sitting among them were the magic masters produced by Mistral in a month.

He counted, and there were at least hundreds or thousands of them, and the number was too many for a month.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mentor, you guys are indeed very productive in Floating City," Zhao Xu praised.

"It's not you, but us," An Tyron corrected, "Actually, there aren't that many, because the players' mages are also rushing to get ready for the event, so there are so many."

Zhao Xu was startled and looked around, noticing that all the data on the top ten mages on the forum was complete, except for none of them were from the magical capital of Mistral.

It seemed that the players with the most talent for magic should all be assigned to this place, except for those who took the special talent route.

Only now did Zhao Xu realize that the players from Mistral had to wait for each month's unified modification of the mystical lock before they could perform the ritual, which meant that everything was in vain.

As Zhao Xu looked around, he noticed that there were already many new player mages waiting in their seats, waiting for their turn to awaken to the ritual. They were whispering to each other, looking at the two unexpected guests.

Everyone here had come in a straightforward manner, but these two seemed to have teleported in a big and showy way.

Zhao Xu strained to recognize the players' attire and identified the group on the left side as a group of players.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's eyes widened.

He saw a beautiful girl with a calm expression sitting calmly in the front row.

It was Wang Qingwei!

In the past, she was the highest-level mage among players and had become one of the leaders of the Earth Force after crossing over. Her new mage training site was indeed Mistral, the Floating City.

Years after crossing over, Arthur faced the invasion of the Abyss and Hell, and the Earth Force sent an envoy to visit the Northern Alliance to try to persuade the other side to jointly protect the Earth's civilians.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu was serving as a bodyguard in the Northern Alliance at the time. His family had already been placed under the protection of the alliance due to his connections with Zhao Xu, and they were arranged to live in a town several stages away from the front lines. Who could have predicted that when Zhao Xu went out to fight, he would be ambushed by the Black Dragon and his family would be affected?

Zhao Xu also had the opportunity to witness the legendary beauty, thanks to that one mission. However, at that time, his identity was that of a bodyguard at the headquarters of the Northern Alliance, which was just a step above ordinary soldiers.

On the other hand, the opponent, without mentioning the leadership's ability to cross dimensions and bring divine blessings, was already enough to be a guest of honor at the lord's residence in the Northern Cities, simply due to his high-level mage identity.

As for Wang Qingwei, he had not yet developed the extraordinary aura that he would later possess, and was still just an ordinary player sitting below, waiting for his awakening to begin.

Zhao Xu suddenly remembered the legend he had heard in his past life, which said that Wang Qingwei awakened to become a 1st-level mage on the 20th day and later became a model for new players to console themselves. Why did it take so long for this inside information to come out?

It seemed that the 5-day difference was intentional, perhaps to exaggerate Wang Qingwei's later achievements. After all, 15 days was still within the range of over 100 players.

"Teacher, how many days ago was it?" Zhao Xu asked in a low voice.

"25 days ago," An Tiya replied.

"Not a whole month, was it?" Zhao Xu asked sarcastically.

"I still eat three meals a day, not two," An Tiya said.

Listening to An Tiya's nonsense, Zhao Xu sighed and said, "Teacher, even someone like me knows that legendary magic doesn't work like that."

"Ah, you're asking why?" An Tiya seemed to have just caught on to Zhao Xu's question.

However, Zhao Xu already knew that she was doing it on purpose.
"It's very simple, because you have finished learning six first-level spells today, so let's arrange to wake up a bit earlier, okay?"
