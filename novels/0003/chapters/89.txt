Chapter 090: Trial

The wanderer, Rainbow, didn't expect the crow's mouth to be Summer, but rather Niu Xia.

Everyone initially showed respect for Niu Xia's knowledge, but later became curious and asked more questions. Who would have thought that the goddess of misfortune, Nala, would care for them so much, and soon, they would be treated to a live teaching session.

At this time, everyone still remembered Zhao Xu's words that the coverage distance of the curse cannon was 40 meters, and they were currently about 40 meters away from the devil's head icon.

As long as they retreated quickly, they might only suffer one round of attacks. However, no one retreated because they had a live board behind them.

Even if they gambled on their jumping ability, they would have to go to the curse cannon first to get enough momentum, otherwise, it would be the same as walking into the pit.

"Either go to the dead end and make a comeback," the poet, Qingwa, said directly and decisively, "or charge forward."

The devil's head icon's curse cannon had already accumulated energy and was ready to unleash a devastating attack at any moment.

Luo Ya, as the leader of the small team, knew he had to make a decision. If he stayed here, he would be subjected to endless spells and would definitely die.

However, ahead of them was a corner, and no one knew what was on the other side. Even if they went around the corner, they would at least suffer two rounds of attacks.

As for jumping into the pit behind them, it was certain that they would die. But at least they could die with a few more people.

Luo Ya, who had made a decision in a limited emergency rescue situation, once again stood at the crossroads of life.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Jumping into a pit——" was all he had time to say before a fireball with a deafening roar shot towards them.

Rao Ya, who was familiar with this thing, already knew their team was doomed, and his only instinct was to retreat backwards as fast as he could.

In the blink of an eye, the fireball landed directly at his initial landing spot, crashing to the ground with a loud thud, followed by an explosion that was like a sealed room filled with gas leaking out.

Countless waves of flames erupted from the fallen fireball, covering an area of about 6-7 meters in diameter with blazing flames.

Even the most skeptical scholar who thought that a mage should not be reduced to just casting damaging spells would not deny the destructive power of the level three spell "Fireball".

Unless specifically trained, most mages would not possess the true killing spell "Fireball" until they reached level five, and therefore would not be qualified to serve as an output mage.

However, when the flames dissipated, the stunned team, who had not had time to jump into the pit, found that they were completely unscathed.

A magical sphere emitting a faint glow enveloped them.

The air was filled with an otherworldly energy, as if the endless flames could not penetrate this mysterious sphere.

"This is?" Rao Ya exclaimed in astonishment.

The power of the fireball spell had just left him feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of a powerful magic.

Who would have thought that there was still more to come?

As everyone's gaze fell upon the staff in Zhao Xu's hand.

The staff, which had once been a simple wooden staff adorned with a crystal, now seemed to possess mysterious powers, just like the legendary stories.

"This is a level two spell shield," Zhao Xu said calmly, "Within this barrier, it can block spells of level three or lower."

After finishing speaking, Zhao Xu looked at Luo Ya and smiled, saying, "This one needs to add money."

He had just released a four-level arcane spell "Invalid Boundary" with his protective staff, directly consuming the staff's energy.

However, he had to do so, as the fireball spell with a damage of 5D6 was something he couldn't avoid no matter what.

Even if he used the spell "Resist Energy Damage" which only required one energy point, it would only be able to withstand one wave.

This curse cannon was going to keep launching attacks non-stop.

So, Zhao Xu was both saving others and saving himself this time.

"Ah, it's coming again," Yu Yu noticed that the demon's head icon emitted a beam of light, which was then extinguished.

Immediately after, a residual wave appeared on the magic sphere.

[Hint: The "Hint" spell in the curse cannon cannot penetrate the "Invalid Boundary" spell, and the spell has failed.]

Zhao Xu looked at his information panel and explained, "Nothing to worry about, this is the second spell 'Hint', and it has two more spells to release. It will only stop releasing energy after the fifth round."

"However, this cannon can only release three-level spells, so within the 20-round duration of the spell, the body inside the sphere is safe."

The "Invalid Boundary" spell lasts one round for each caster's level.

Zhao Xu's staff caster level is as high as 20, so it can last for 20 rounds.

If Anniya personally released it, according to the opponent's added level, which exceeded 72, it would be able to last over 72 rounds.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, are you a descendant of a secret school? Is this test a selection trial for your school?"

At this moment, Luo Ya finally understood that the wooden staff in Zhao Xu's hand was not as simple as a "magic wand" he thought it was. Following the leader Eis, he had seen the world and had a general idea of the value of this staff. This kind of thing appearing in the hands of an adventurer on the earth, especially one who had just started his journey a month ago, was only possible in one way - that Zhao Xu was a candidate from a secret sect.

Luo Ya remembered that the secret sect would let the candidates challenge each other to a life-or-death battle, and the one who succeeded would become the successor. Thinking about this, Luo Ya didn't care about the third spell that was about to come.

He lowered his head, "Zhao Xu, I apologize for my previous mistakes."

The members of the Maple Leaf Squad looked at each other in confusion, not expecting Zhao Xu, who was from a broken sect and only a practitioner of magic, to be mistaken by Luo Ya as a direct descendant of a mysterious power.

At this moment, they still underestimated the true value of the staff in Zhao Xu's hand. In their eyes, a four-level spell scroll was worth around 700 gold coins and was not a astronomical level. However, in this situation, even if there was a slight bias in the camp, Yu Yu knew she should keep quiet and not ruin Zhao Xu's plan.

Deception might directly lead to the camp going neutral or chaotic, but the cost of silence would be much lower. Zhao Xu nodded slightly, although Luo Ya had not guessed that he was here to complete the task left by An Ti Nuo Ya.

"Meanwhile, he was relying on the method that could reverse everything behind him, and dared to walk in confidently, unlike a filtering trial like refining an elixir. However, Luoya ultimately underestimated him by a level and stepped onto the edge of the truth.

"'Mr. Zhongxia, you can choose the rewards from this adventure first,' Luoya continued to bow and say.

"Leaves of the four people were left with their mouths agape, wondering if this was the treatment they deserved?"
