Chapter 79: Candles

Mistral's floating city, the library of knowledge, several days ago.

"Did you get hit by a skeleton and cast a shadow? Are you trying to upgrade your religious knowledge skills by reading a book on how to deal with yurei?" Anastasya asked, looking at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu smiled slightly and didn't say much.

He had once led a team to wipe out a group of yurei, and naturally couldn't open his mouth to Anastasya about it.

"What do you think about dealing with yurei?" Anastasya quickly asked Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu had never done anything without a good reason, and wouldn't do something without a reason.

"Although you humans from Earth may not often encounter yurei, you can actually ask me directly. I've killed more yurei than the author of this book has ever seen," Anastasya said.

Zhao Xu finally put down the book in his hand and looked at Anastasya, saying, "Teacher, can I actually disperse a level 1 undead creature right now?"

"That's impossible," Anastasya said softly. "In theory, a priest can disperse a non-living being that is 4 levels higher than themselves. However, yurei have +4 resistance and are equivalent to a 5HD non-living being. So you can't disperse it."

Zhao Xu was about to ask a question, but then realized that, based on his priest level and charisma, even if he had a lucky break, he could only disperse a 2HD non-living being at most.

As he thought about this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a sigh.

Even if he could disperse it, what's the point?
Here is the translation of the text:

After they had experienced that eerie crisis of the soul, they immediately summoned a high-ranking priest to destroy and purify the area. However, a few days later, the soul still did not remain dead and came back to life.

Finally, they had no choice but to seal up the pit and never reopen it.

"Teacher, souls like this will always come back to life, won't they?" Zhao Xiu thought for a moment before asking his inner question, already having turned to the last chapter on reincarnation.

"How can they not come back to life?" Anzhi Nay asked in response.

Zhao Xiu opened the book to the illustration of the soul and pointed to it, saying, "When a soul dies, it can perform a 'level + 1D20' check. If the result is greater than 16, it will come back to life. If it's a 15th-level soul, the result will definitely be greater than 16, so it will definitely come back to life."

This was a point that had been bothering him for a long time in his past life.

"Ah, let's correct that first. The actual check result is actually 1, and there are special circumstances that occur. Sometimes the value can be passed, but sometimes it fails. It's just that no one knows when 1 will occur and when it won't, and it's all attributed to the will of the world."

As Anzhi Nay said this, her eyes took on a strange, otherworldly color.

"And besides, you know nothing about the power of the priest."

"There are ways to seal, control, and even fail checks."

Hearing these words, Zhao Xiu felt a surge of confidence.

"Teacher, I think you're explaining it much more simply than the book. This book is so complicated, it's giving me a headache. As I said, this book should be a recommended reading list to enhance one's knowledge of the faith."

Seeing Anzhi Nay clarify things for him, Zhao Xiu hastily praised her and complained a bit.

"Oh, I dare say the author didn't see as many souls as I did, is because——"
Here is the translation of the text:

"This book was actually written by me when I was young."

...Zhao Xu gazed at the eerie and terrifying ghost-like figure before him, with a mouth agape as if he was about to swallow it whole. He smiled lightly.

At this moment, An Xinyao had already grasped the killing blow in his hand.

"You know nothing about the power of the mage."

Zhao Xu was holding a small lantern with a narrow space that could only fit one candle. However, the candle on top had already been enchanted, and as soon as it was taken out of his backpack and touched the air, the candle suddenly ignited.

A mysterious aura filled the surrounding area.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia lit the "Prayer Candle" in the neutral good alignment, within a 10-meter radius, granting a +2 bonus to attack, saving throw, and skill checks for members of the same alignment.】

"Otherworld...," Zhao Xu began to chant a spell with an ordinary-sounding name.

In an instant, the air around him froze, and time and space were pulled in, causing the candle to start emitting an infinite amount of sacred aura.

A faint glow began to appear in the air, forming a circular ring about 6-7 meters in diameter.

More ominously, a sacred aura began to appear behind the ring, reminiscent of the heavenly kingdom.

As if the holy light was about to descend upon the earth, destroying all evil and purifying all impurities.

Seeing the scene before him, Zhao Xu's terrifying experience suddenly resurfaced in his mind, causing him to let out a terrified scream, as if he had been plunged into despair.

Fortunately, the ghost did not receive the terrifying, supernatural ability to scream, but its hoarse voice sent shivers down Zhao Xu's spine.

In an instant, the ghost-like figure fled as if its life depended on it, as if it had glimpsed a terror even more fearsome than death.
Here is the translation:

As if a sword of shadowy force was chasing after it, the yin soul didn't even look back, with not a hint of attachment, and suddenly disappeared into the limited scope of the torch's light.

Zhao Xù didn't look back, gazing straight ahead, unable to see the deeper darkness.

He took a deep breath, and the last word he was about to say remained unspoken.

The original glowing circle had lost its supporting power and slowly began to contract.

Night fell upon the earth.

This prayer candle, which could burn for four hours, had already burned out a small part of its wax after Zhao Xù had just muttered a few simple phrases.

Zhao Xù didn't bother to worry about it; he just stood there, gazing straight ahead, in the cold wind.

He waited for about a minute or two before his protective charms disappeared, and he finally relaxed.

Zhao Xù immediately extinguished the candle in the lantern.

As he gazed at the candle that had just been lit, which had scared away the yin soul, Zhao Xù smiled.

Indeed, the power of the spell was this powerful.

It was still just a residual effect.

In reality, it was not the candle that scared away the yin soul, but the nine-level spell "Gates of the Otherworld" behind it.

As long as he spoke the name of the spell, the candle would instantly burn out and transform into a portal to the Otherworld, summoning powerful creatures from it.

Anastasia had introduced him to several powerful creatures, which he had familiarized himself with and carefully memorized the details of.

One of them was the Archangel of Blaze, also known as the Divine Servant of Blaze.

This 23rd-level challenge creature had both powerful martial arts and the ability to cast nine-level spells, equivalent to a cleric.
Here is the translation:

"Essentially, in the realm of Arthurian legend, everything is an enigma. Even if the ancient dragon comes, it can be defeated, not to mention a mere spirit. After shaking his head, Zhao Xu still turned around and helped the few people who had fallen to their knees back up."
