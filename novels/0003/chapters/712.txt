Chapter 713: Domination
What is this?

The "True Knowledge" ability allows Zhao Xu's gaze to pierce through the darkness, bypassing the shadows and heavy fog, and sees a man transformed into a spider lying in the corner.

His upper body is already torn and tattered, his left half of his face has turned into a spider-like shape, and several spider legs are growing out of his back, with fine hairs spreading across his body, giving a chilling feeling.

"Who are you?" Zhao Xu asked.

The man simply raised an eye at Zhao Xu, "Ah? A courtesan of Rose? How did you end up in such a place?"

"No, I'm just a traveler who got lost here," Zhao Xu said.

The next moment, his gaze narrowed, and he finally realized that the man's back was stuck to the wall of the labyrinth, with countless fine threads penetrating his entire body.

"Traveler?" The vagabond-like man sneered and looked up, gazing at the ordinary ceiling.

"Are you imprisoned or exiled here?" Zhao Xu asked.

The man shook his head directly, "I exiled myself here."

"I fell in love with someone I shouldn't have."

"With a human girl who transformed into a wax moth?" Zhao Xu pointed out directly, and the vagabond's eyebrows immediately furrowed, his expression becoming extremely painful.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu directly bypassed the man and continued to walk silently into the darkness ahead.

The spider hunter was surprised, "Young master, according to human custom, when encountering someone from the same kind, it's not natural to offer help, is it?"

Zhao Xu shook his head, "Sorry, I'm not curious about other people's past."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Or perhaps he doesn't even want to climb out of the pit himself, so what's the use of my saying anything?"

"For the appearance of a human being, he doesn't want to seek help, but rather continues to imprison himself in this place through self-punishment, so why can't I fulfill his wishes?"

"According to his own will, is it not cruel to force someone to wake up and accept the harsh reality, to make him realize the pain?"

Zhao Xu smiled.

This line of thought had the stupid spider trapped in deep contemplation, and it began to feel a humming noise.

Finally, until they reached the portal leading to the outside world, Zhao Xu did not encounter the appearance of the Wax Melting Demon.

He had a slight sense of regret in his heart.

Normally, encounters with success are inevitable, but Zhao Xu failed for the first time.

As he touched the icy portal emitting a cold and eerie feeling, he felt the spider-like gaze of the spider above him.

Zhao Xu's body shape disappeared in the labyrinth, as if he were a passerby, leaving no trace.

Upon arriving outside, Zhao Xu discovered that the entire demon web pit was surrounded by countless interconnected stone plates, forming a vast network that seemed to have no boundaries.

These connected stone slabs were 6 meters wide and 1 meter thick, and were much larger than the labyrinth he had just left.

The outer area of the demon web pit was filled with pipe-shaped corridors wrapped in spider webs, making it difficult to walk, almost like climbing.

At first glance, the demon web pit seemed like a temporary structure built in a virtual space, with no idea how much mental and physical effort the spider had invested.
Here is the translation of the text:

Most permanent residents of the magical net's abyss are naturally born followers of the spider goddess Rosh, where the majority of the clergy are women, and men can only exist by being attached to women. Some families may even sacrifice their youngest male children to appease the goddess.

The followers of Rosh strive to satisfy the goddess's erratic and evil desires, and the most convenient way to do this is to help the goddess consume the main material plane.

Theoretically, the core circle surrounding the spider goddess consists of two types of roles: "advisors" and "proxies." The proxies are responsible for expanding the goddess's territory in the main world, and they can also be seen as seeds and spies in other forces.

At this time, Zhao Xu is in a state of invisibility, silently observing a group of Rosh's patrol team patrolling about 10 meters away.

The essence of Rosh is that she is a dark elf, slightly shorter and thinner than humans, with black skin and white hair, creating a striking contrast. However, this is not in line with Zhao Xu's aesthetic.

Dark elves generally dwell in the underground and are a fallen and evil subspecies.

So, Zhao Xu sees very few of them, and he is curious about the matriarchal social structure, where the priests have the ruling power. A priest is accompanied by a group of elf rangers, all wearing simple chain armor to avoid hindering their movements.

Therefore, the natural profession of Rosh is also a priest, and they can choose from four domains: chaos, destruction, evil, and cunning, none of which sound like doing good deeds.

Rosh?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu stood on this land, as if he had heard the "breathing rhythm" of the spider goddess Rosh from the heavens and the earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

Slowly, he began to sense something, as if he had transformed into a high-ranking priest, constantly seeking the goddess's bestowal of power.

He even felt the goddess's power descending upon him, radiating an aura of absolute evil, or it could be said that his essence was the embodiment of evil and his will.

Each time the power pulsed, it was filled with malice, and every evil thought was profound and far-reaching.

Although Zhao Xiu had previously felt that he was familiar with the goddess Roselle.

At this moment, he was still astonished by the deeper sense of evil that he felt within himself.

He was like a disguised priest, walking through a secret surveillance channel, quietly hiding in a corner, observing the process of Roselle communicating with her followers in this realm.

This process of listening in, Zhao Xiu even felt the goddess Roselle's disdain for her enemies, even greater than her own power, and she still responded with a condescending attitude.

These priests and the followers behind them were all pawns of Roselle.

Slowly, Zhao Xiu had released his full-body defense, gradually sensing the strange and mysterious aspects of this magical web space.

From the beginning, he had been curious.

Roselle had combined her powers with the 66th layer of the magical web abyss, completing their joint retreat.

On the other hand, Roselle had created a primitive evil demon, "Molten Demon", which was a simulation of the abyss's craftsmanship.

If he didn't exist, Roselle would be more like a child of the abyss, using her every move to promote the return of the abyss's will.

Alternatively, it could be said that other demon lords may not have had the same capital to do these things.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's because of the deep connection between Luo Si and this spatial dimension that Zhao Xu felt the dimension's presence and gradually learned the goddess's secrets.

This is the coin's dual face - accepting benefits, but also accepting drawbacks.

Conspiracy?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's mind was flooded with this word.

It was as if a firework exploding in the darkness, sparking a burst of inspiration that illuminated all his thoughts.

Is it a conspiracy?

No.

It's divine providence!

Conspiracy divine providence!

Zhao Xu's mind flashed a clear and transparent phrase:

Luo Si has plotted countless conspiracies within the material dimension, and she can keenly sense when to execute a conspiracy and when to stop planning one.

Betraying and selling friends is the eternal theme under Luo Si's command.

As Zhao Xu felt the sensation of this spatial dimension, his astonishment grew, and he felt as if he was standing on the river of history, seeing countless fragments of this goddess.

She likes those who have achieved their positions through cunning and ruthless means, and she shows great mercy to her loyal followers.

However, her other side is absolute dominance and cruelty towards other living beings, far more cruel than a tyrant.

In an instant, a scene flashed before Zhao Xu's eyes.

He saw Luo Si transform into an elegant and haughty dark elf leader, commanding her subordinates and collaborating with other deep-layered lords.

He saw Luo Si, transformed into a monstrous eight-legged spider-like creature, lifting her massive foot and releasing countless terrifying toxins, slaughtering the entire city's residents. She spat out a web, ensnaring even legendary warriors.

As the powerful force capable of personally intervening, the existence of the Arachne, Rose, in the depths of the abyss, is not ordinary. Even he had heard, at this moment, the residents of the entire demon web abyss, praising and extolling the virtues of this mistress, lamenting the sacrifice of their goddess. Of course, the words of praise and adoration also contained a sense of fear.

Suddenly, a voice of indignation came from the sky above the abyss: "Who is spying on this place?"

It was as if a thief caught in the act, and Zhao Xuan instantly withdrew from his observation state.

Or rather, this feeling of being deeply connected to the entire world, like an addiction, made him not only unable to withdraw but also more deeply pursue it.

It was this behavior that allowed Rose to discover the anomaly beneath the sky.

In fact, Zhao Xuan's actions were almost like lifting someone's skirt to take a look, or even evaluating it in detail.

No, he had to hurry up and leave.

Zhao Xuan suddenly felt the attention of countless forces rushing towards him, as if a pair of eyes opened in the darkness, trying to probe his location.

Although he possessed a "True Knowledge" at the level of divine power, Zhao Xuan felt an extremely deep sense of this trace.

Perhaps.

The authority of the abyss was now in his hands.

This glance had allowed him to sense the true nature of this realm and, at the same time, grasp the control of this space. After knowing the secret, he also understood the operating rules.

Once he realized this, Zhao Xuan felt a sense of impending doom as the Arachne, Rose, was about to launch a catastrophic attack. However, Zhao Xuan remained calm and composed, as if completely unruffled.
Here is the translation of the text:

He took a small breath, and then plunged into the water like a frog jumping into a pond. It was as if he was about to compete with Rosa for control of this domain.

"Who are you?"

This time, a louder and more shocking roar erupted in the sky.

The originally calm clouds suddenly transformed into a fierce whirlwind, with countless gusts of wind howling, thunder booming in the sky, and a fierce gust of wind blowing people's faces. The ground was covered with a layer of dust.

The elf walking on the ground knelt down in shock, begging the goddess for mercy and retracting the sudden anger.

Generally speaking, when a god fights, the first to be cleared is the small fish and shrimp within the god's realm, which may be crushed to pieces by a single impact wave, and even reach a critical stage. They are still the key to replenishing the god's power.

Zhao Xu slightly closed his eyes, trying to sense the rhythm between heaven and earth.

In an instant, a black shadow attacked!

Zhao Xu's eyes widened, realizing that Rosa was not worthy of being the first to combine with this domain. This reaction speed was still beyond his expectation.

"Interdimensional transmission."

The next moment, Zhao Xu activated the original failed spell again.

Since he sensed the rhythm of this domain, he had obtained a backstage administrator's username, and began to issue instructions according to his will.

Of course, the "transmission" ability sealed by Rosa, Zhao Xu did not say a word and perfectly solved it.

In an instant, Zhao Xu found himself back in a magical place.

This was a limited spatial layer, and initially, Zhao Xu began to sense the special nature of this domain.

Deep Abyss 570, Sadaera.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's gaze was as if frozen in mid-air, slowly shifting from the ground to the endless horizon, and instantaneously, countless scenes flashed before his eyes. He seemed to be soaring in the sky like an eagle, gazing down at the lush and verdant land divided into uniform blocks by mountain peaks.

This was a place utterly different from the desolate wasteland he had imagined, with the ocean teeming with rich flavors and the eternal sunset casting a golden hue over the entire ocean.

This was, in essence, a paradise in his imagination!

However, Zhao Xu was suddenly awakened, as if he had seen the skull-hearted beauty behind the lovely face.

Because his gaze, from the heights of heaven, looked through the meticulously arranged air gardens and polished marble floors, revealing the hidden cells, living laboratories, and various cruel methods.

Zhao Xu saw that countless people living in this layer had unknowingly fallen in love with the sweet and charming demons disguised as ordinary humans.

They lived in ignorance of the darkness beneath their feet, indulging in luxurious lives.

Until their bodies were completely corrupted, and then they were murdered by the demons they had imagined as their lovers.

Because only then could their souls become the masters of the backstage, strengthening themselves and ruling the entire realm.

By sacrificing their lives and souls, they could enjoy a fleeting sense of joy in their lives.

This was the theme of this layer.

Originally, Zhao Xu had only planned to make a slight detour and then return to the 66th layer of the demon net pit. But he stopped and stayed, observing this new and unfamiliar world.

He was also the ruler of this layer - the Demon Queen, Mei Kan, who was filled with curiosity.
