Chapter 430: 100km Explosion

As the four elemental leaders suddenly found themselves under a mysterious attraction, the massive, over 50-meter-long super-giant body began to blur, as if being drawn by an invisible brush in the void.

Among them, the wind elemental leader, which had been transformed into a whirlwind, was particularly affected, receiving an even greater impact and suppression, as if being disturbed by another reversed whirlwind.

At this moment, the notebook taken out by Zhao Xu was exactly in its focal point.

Suddenly, the wind swords and blades mixed in the whirlwind seemed to weaken and become dull, losing their sharp cutting edge.

Zhao Xu slowly felt himself being enveloped by the powerful airflow, and would no longer lose his balance, but could not fall either.

"Have their eyes changed? Ah, this notebook really——"

Lakshmi was surprised by this sudden change, and if not for this, she would have directly handed the notebook to Zhao Xu at the beginning, allowing him to upgrade.

At this time, Zhao Xu was also busy gathering information from the scene, seizing the opportunity to analyze the details, in order to arrange for the next layout.

He noticed that the extremely powerful elemental leaders, with their eyes now emitting a deep blue glow, like shadowy silhouettes dancing in front of Zhao Xu's eyes, this black-bound notebook, which had evolved twice.

This notebook was brought out by the seven-member group from a mysterious tomb, but each of them encountered disasters afterwards.

Now, Zhao Xu has obtained the notebooks from the three families of Mistrata, which were passed down by the other party, and has merged them together.

This all seems to have no relation to the elements at all.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the mysterious entrance to the tomb containing the notebook was surrounded by a clear special pattern nearby. Thunder struck the ground, and a whirlwind of flames erupted. The pattern indicated the three elements of earth, water, and fire, but the element of air was absent. Zhao Xu had seen that pattern before, and it was clear that it was impossible to draw the intangible air element.

Or, the thick smoke that rose from the thunder-struck earth could also represent the element of air.

Therefore, Zhao Xu concluded that this notebook was related to the secrets of the elements.

Especially this mysterious pattern, he had seen it before at the residence of Tang De, the leader of the Northern Alliance, whose daughter was Floria.

He had also heard it mentioned in the whispers of the dead in the desolate ruins during his trip from Luca Castle in the Western Kingdom to the town of Northern Alliance.

Even two other notebooks were also found in the Northern Alliance, as if the entire region was shrouded in a mysterious haze.

Zhao Xu knew that this was certainly a secret unlike any other.

He was also certain that Anniya, the mysterious woman, had some knowledge about it, but she refused to elaborate, only allowing him to accept the notebook's power and upgrade.

As it turned out, she had taken him to explore the lost treasures of the Ittier Kingdom, including the fake treasure trove of Ernest's secrets.

Anniya told him that it was only natural for a parent to keep secrets from their child, and she would never hide anything from him for personal gain.

There was only one explanation for everything:

This notebook was something Anniya believed he was not yet worthy to know the secrets within.

Perhaps he would only be qualified to know when he had collected seven notebooks.

As Zhao Xu thought for a moment, the four element masters remained still, as if waiting for new knowledge.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xu wanted to probe, but remained silent and waited. He seemed like a chess player who knew his opponent's next move and was thinking about his last chance to break through, not daring to make a move rashly. Just as the whirlwind was about to pass, he was relieved that he couldn't maintain his inner calm state that was affected by the negative emotions, but he was startled instead. To break free from this situation, he could either use his reflexes to avoid it or suppress the negative emotions.

He recalled that after triggering the "anti-magic zone" area mentioned in the forums, he would be unable to use his "Iron Heart" ability, which would make it difficult for him to continue. Especially since the North Union, which was near the East Empire where the Nine Swords' legacy was located, was still within reach.

He had to make a move. "Master, shall we try?" Lis asked, feeling that dragging on wasn't an option.

At this moment, the Four Elemental Lords were all frozen in place and unable to move, but no one knew how long they could hold out.

ViVi also looked at him with a tense expression.

"Okay." Zhao Xu said, controlling his body and leaning slightly to one side, and then quickly grabbed his notebook. However, he immediately lost his balance due to his deviation from the wind eye, and his entire body was swept away by the whirlwind.

Slowly, he descended along with the vortex, and the sharp wind blade that was as cold as winter frost and as hot as the scorching sun no longer affected him.

Zhao Xu also slowly descended onto the island. At this moment, he finally noticed that his two legendary magic puppets had somehow broken down during their brief exchange.
Here is the translation of the text:

Before him, two demonic statues with defense power exceeding 40 levels, were as fragile as paper in front of the four elemental masters. Despite the powerful punch, which was blocked by the star cloak's magical mechanism, the demonic statues could only absorb the blow. The four elemental masters, who had legendary powers, were attacking with incredible force and piercing the demonic statues' damage reduction.

Realizing that the two legendary demonic statues couldn't last much longer, Zhao Xu immediately gave the order to recall them.

"It seems they sense some kind of will and cannot move," said Vivian, still holding the long sword beside Zhao Xu, her face pale and sweaty. Originally, she had some confidence in her ability to protect Zhao Xu, but this time, facing legendary monsters, she felt a bit disappointed.

"Something seems off," said Lark, his tone urgent, not even addressing Zhao Xu with his usual respect.

Zhao Xu noticed that the four elemental masters, which had already lost their balance, were starting to break apart. The elemental powers, which were once united, were slowly separating and dispersing, like a candle losing its core.

"It's as if they're being driven out," Zhao Xu said.

Just then, Vivian couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

Before them, the four elemental masters had all transformed into the original four teleportation portals. These were four channels leading to the inner elemental positions.
Since the birth of the Arthurian realm, the four major elements and the positive and negative energy realms have been attached and living together. At this moment, these energy channels began to emit a majestic and solemn aura, as if they were about to unfold a vast and majestic road.

Zhao Xu even looked through the nearest elemental gateway, which transformed into a gateway of light, and saw the state of the inner elemental realm. Above was the sky, and below was also the sky, with layer upon layer of clouds drifting by, and thunderstorms blowing through the gateway.

However, amidst this peaceful atmosphere, Zhao Xu felt the lingering presence of the elemental gods' power from the homeland of the flying creatures. He even saw some mysterious and ancient cloud patterns drifting by.

"It's the power of the ancient elemental gods," Lacis also sensed this intention. "I knew they hadn't truly died; it's no wonder that the gods of the later eras only reside in the outer layer realm."

"Elemental glory may have been temporarily extinguished, but it will never fade away forever. One day, they will return when order and chaos are reconciled."

Vivian suddenly fell into a trance-like state, muttering to herself, "You must lament and then slowly lament. Run away and say it later."

Zhao Xu murmured to himself, "I've already seen the four major elemental gates connecting the inner layers of the four major elements."

Instantly, the elemental forces representing the four inner layers burst forth. However, they did not spread towards Zhao Xu, but instead formed a bridge, serving as a channel of communication, slowly drawing closer to the four elemental gates.

Gradually, they began to merge.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh no, we've caused chaos, and it's led to this. I underestimated that notebook, and I underestimated the power behind this obstacle, and it's not just an ordinary elemental lord, but a terror that surpasses our imagination."
Lakis shouted in Zhao Xu's mind.

"Hurry up, the fusion of the four elements will only lead to one result."
"The destruction of the world in its birth."

Just as Lakis was saying this, Zhao Xu had already grabbed Vi Vi and continued to fly away towards the rear.

"This portal is large enough to destroy a region of over a hundred kilometers."
Lakis couldn't help but wrinkle her brow and said, "It's too late, Master, you should try to cast a rainbow light ball or something."

However, this time Lakis' voice was a bit weaker.

But Zhao Xu was currently shouting a spell at a distance - Higher Transmission Technique.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your Higher Transmission Technique has failed.】
【This location is affected by the dimensional lock effect, prohibiting all interdimensional projection, flashing, teleportation, and other similar abilities.】
In an instant, Zhao Xu almost lost his balance, flailing wildly in this void.

"Let's gamble."
Lakis' tone became even more urgent, but she didn't have any confidence.

"This elemental force can even separate souls. When that time comes, Master, you may not even be able to return to the world of the dead."
"This great gain comes with great risk. Master, I hope you will remember this sentence in the future."

Lakis' voice suddenly became weaker at this moment.

From the beginning, she had realized that this land could not be transmitted.

Zhao Xu was currently feeling a strange energy spreading from behind him, as if a nuclear bomb was about to explode, making his back hair stand on end.
Here is the translation of the text:

The extremely high-density energy is currently surging upward in the condensate of the four elements behind him.

"How can a rainbow sphere stop it? It's as if the souls of all beings are being extinguished," Lacis said.

According to legend, the rainbow sphere has a seven-layer effect. The sixth layer can block all spells, and the seventh layer can destroy all spell energy fields.

To break through, one must either use the spell-breaking technique or disassemble it layer by layer with corresponding spells.

"Of course, there's no way to do it normally," Lacis said stubbornly. "But as long as my will is merged with it, it will become a divine rainbow sphere."

"So, you'll have to pay the price of your will this time. How long will you be unconscious for? Or will you never wake up?"

Zhao Xiu's tone turned cold as he sensed something.

This time, Lacis's voice did not come again.

"Lacis, don't you think it's a bit too dramatic to disappear for a long time and then come back in just a few minutes?" Zhao Xiu said, speaking in a light tone, but his face was filled with determination and confidence.

"The blast radius is probably around a hundred kilometers or so," Lacis said, sounding helpless. "But it's too late now. There are only nine seconds left. You can't even fly out of this island."

"Grab onto me," Zhao Xiu said, speaking to Vivian.

At the same time, Zhao Xiu quietly took out the pendant necklace from his backpack and activated the "Flying Thought Pearl" within it.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he and Vivian were affected by the "Wind in the Hand" spell, a seven-ring technique, both of them transformed into misty fog, like the shape-shifting form caused by the three-ring technique.

"It's useless, even if the speed of the Wind in the Hand spell is extremely fast, you'll have to spend an hour to fly out of the explosion range of over a hundred kilometers," Larks' voice was tinged with desperation.

"No, Larks, this spell is meant to protect me, not to fly," Zhao Xu turned around and glanced at the expanding light circle behind him, which had not yet exploded but had already destroyed everything it touched, even hollowing out the center of the island.

Zhao Xu continued to chant the cold, inhuman incantation in his mouth, devoid of human breath.

He knew the loopholes of a few spells, which could be corrected by the World's Will each time they were used.

But he wanted to make it work!

Zhao Xu gritted his teeth, thinking.

"Spell duration - God's stride."

Spell duration: 14400 rounds.

God's stride can be used like the Eye of Prophecy, allowing the user to obtain a boost by dissipating the remaining spell duration.

When God's stride dissipates energy, the remaining duration of the spell can be used to gain an additional 1.8 (full speed 7.2) kilometers per hour.

Zhao Xu gazed at the distant horizon, which was deep and invisible, even without boundaries.

And so, he spread his wings and flew.

"Energy dissipation."

[Adventurer Summer, you have concluded the God's stride spell. In the next 6 seconds, you will obtain a speed of 250,000 (full speed 1,000,000) kilometers per hour.]

6 seconds. 166 kilometers.
