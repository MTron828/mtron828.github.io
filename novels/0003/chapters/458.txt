Chapter 459: Shame of the Dragon Tribe

As Zhao Xu began to chase after the white dragon, Anzinoja and Veian also took off simultaneously, activating their flight abilities to follow.

Zhao Xu noticed the two figures behind him, but showed no surprise.

From the moment he entered Mistral and touched the top floor of the "Legendary Library" in the knowledge library, he had thoroughly read through the book "The Secret of the Giant Dragon" multiple times.

He was familiar with the characteristics of the five-colored dragon and the five-metal dragons, even without using his "Knowledge" skill. Even if he saw a dry dragon, he could tell what kind of dragon it was just by looking at it with his naked eye.

Not to mention the giant dragon, which resembled a reptile with wings, was an ancient being that belonged to the realm of mysterious knowledge. Zhao Xu's current strongest skill was his knowledge (mysterious) skill.

In order to prepare for the legendary magic circle in the future, he had never stopped practicing his mysterious and religious knowledge skills.

"Look at this massive creature, which is just a 12-level adult white dragon at the starting point."

After noticing the two figures behind him, Zhao Xu spoke.

The term "adult" refers to the seventh stage of the dragon tribe's 12 stages of aging, which includes dragons from 200 to 400 years old.

The key point is that from the fifth stage of youth, giant dragons will leave their parents' nests to establish their own nests. However, giant dragons in this stage, especially those from evil dragon tribes or those with low intelligence, often recklessly lay eggs in the countryside, with two to five eggs per clutch.
Here is the translation:

After hatching, the young dragon naturally takes care of itself, and the siblings in the same clutch live together to survive. However, despite having an average intelligence of 6 points from birth, the wicked white dragon, which has a mental age of only 12 points even at adulthood, is naturally prone to reckless breeding. This is also the reason why the common people of the Northern Alliance can see the trail of the white dragon living in the Ice Mountain Range.

Although the young dragon is weak and can even be easily killed by a pair of ordinary soldiers, it is still unable to stop the giant dragon from growing stronger as it ages.

A giant dragon can live for over 1200 years and become a legendary creature with a challenge level of over 20. This is the mighty strength of the dragon clan.

Moreover, the dragon clan often has multiple professions, so even a 12-level adult white dragon like this one can become legendary if it has multiple profession levels.

This is the origin of the Chinese idiom " dragons are not judged by their appearance".

"Can you see through this white dragon's true nature?" Ansenya asked Zhao Xu, who was standing beside her.

Although the three of them were flying at high speed, the wind and snow in front of them created a lot of noise, but Ansenya's voice was still very clear as it entered their ears.

"I haven't gotten close enough to see," Zhao Xu replied.

His 2nd-level "Secret Vision" ability, obtained through his Spellguard, allowed him to see through magic light within a radius of several tens of meters, including biological spells.

This "white dragon" is a strong dragon or a weak lizard, depending on the opponent's "sorcerer's content".

"This dragon's escape speed is fast enough to be deadly."
Here is the translation of the text:

Anniya looked at the white dragon in front of her, its wings flapping continuously, and couldn't help but laugh, "When the white dragon was born, its scales were like mirrors, reflecting light, but now its color has turned dull and it's not cute at all."

Zhao Xu didn't comment on Anniya's words.

Even a weak juvenile dragon has the strength comparable to that of a grown man, and its attacking power is even stronger than that of ordinary militia. It can easily kill an ordinary person with one swipe of its claw, making it impossible to find it cute.

As a professional skill, the white dragon's ability is in stealth and camouflage, and its color can adapt to the snowy environment, making it almost impossible to detect. This is also the reason why the opponent dared to come to the city of Oulu during the big snowstorm.

Unfortunately, the opponent encountered Anniya, a terrifying existence with 100+ detection and listening skills, who can detect a needle dropped a hundred meters away. For Anniya, the white dragon's 10-meter-long body, even with wind and snow cover, is still too conspicuous, like a large car hiding a vehicle with a three-color tarpaulin.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was flapping his own wings, moving slowly and clumsily, but his speed itself wouldn't deceive anyone, and he was slowly pulling them away.

The giant dragon in front of them was flying at a normal slow speed, which was 10 meters per second at the bottom, and could fly over a hundred kilometers in an hour if it flew fast. Not to mention that the giant dragon tribe has excellent innate abilities and endurance, and can fly over 400 kilometers in a day without batting an eyelid, which is equivalent to crossing a province in one day.

Anniya also noticed this point, but Zhao Xu had just not yet brought up his "Shadow Steed", which was faster than the white dragon. Now, they were relying on their own flying speed, which was still maintained by the acceleration technique, but if they continued to lag behind, the gap would only grow wider.
Here is the translation:

"Alright, let's just go and catch it," Anzhi Noja instructed.

At this time, Zhao Xu looked back at Anzhi Noja and said, "Teacher, this is a four-grade spellcasting position, and I don't have many of them."

In reality, his intention was that Anzhi Noja would release this spell.

For Zhao Xu, even if he added up the three-ring spellcasting positions he had merged into four-ring spellcasting positions, it would still only be 2 + 3 = 5 four-ring spellcasting positions.

Anzhi Noja let out a soft laugh and said, "You're too naive. When we get to the treasure trove in the White Dragon's lair, you won't be able to divide it with me. This White Dragon knows how to drive and control the winter wolves, and it's possible that it's a treasure dragon."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu's adrenal glands seemed to rise by several notches.

When dragons reach a certain age, they will leave their parents or break away from the original group of young dragons that supported each other and start living independently.

As they begin to walk alone, they are driven by their desire for wealth and will often build their own lair.

Therefore, if you can find the lair of a dragon above a certain age, you can obtain a substantial amount of wealth.

The ferocious-looking but simple-minded White Dragon is a representative of this.

Zhao Xu remembered that they didn't understand the tricks of the three rabbit holes and liked to put all their life's treasures in one lair.

Generally, White Dragons choose lairs made of ice blocks to reflect the gemstones' sparkling light.

Zhao Xu rubbed his forehead, recalling that the White Dragon was fond of diamonds.

As he was almost a five-ring mage, he should start preparing the materials for the revival spell, and who knows, maybe the child of a poor family like him will have to start early.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's gaze condensed instantly, focusing on the spine of the white dragon's back ahead, as if the stone-like luster had already become radiant. This kind of teleportation spell, strong as it is, relies solely on linguistic elements, so even if one's entire body is bound tightly and their mouth is stuffed with rags, it's still impossible to block this spell.

Unless, like Zhao Xu, one activates the "Silent Curse" ring on the hand, shielding the area's sounds, it's only then that there's a chance to deflect it.

Therefore, to immobilize a mage's spellcasting ability, it's best to use a "Weak Intellect" spell that damages the opponent's intelligence attribute, making them unable to think of even basic countermeasures. This is the true, effortless approach.

"Forward!"

Zhao Xu issued this extremely brief "incantation" at this moment.

Simultaneously, his gaze also shifted to the opponent's forehead, focusing on the white dragon farther ahead, where it seemed as if a whirlpool had formed.

From the day Zhao Xu first touched magic, he knew that spellcasting distance is divided into contact, near, middle, and far ranges. The distance of the "Random Door" spell, which Zhao Xu could transmit to, was his maximum transmission distance.

The far-distance spell, basic 120 meters, extends by 12 meters per level.

Under the influence of more than 20 levels of spellcasting, Zhao Xu grasped Anzhiya with one hand and Viyuan with the other, instantly traversing hundreds of meters.

At this moment, the white dragon was still biting its teeth and flying furiously, its foamy saliva blown dry by the wind and snow.

Suddenly, it was stunned to see the icy world before it, where three mysterious figures suddenly flashed into view.
The white dragon directly widened its eyes, which were as big as copper bells, as if it had fallen into a state of extreme shock. Suddenly, its wings folded forward, and the massive dragon's body came to a sudden stop in front of Zhao Xu. Zhao Xu, who had just used the "Any Door" technique, felt his body's stagnation dissipate.

He directly raised his hand, holding the super magical staff, and pointed it at the white dragon in the distance, as if a destructive spell was about to burst forth. Looking at the dragon, which had suddenly stopped in its tracks, Zhao Xu's heart secretly began to calculate.

In his mind, a plan to decompose and sell the white dragon slowly took shape. This elderly white dragon had finally grown to an enormous size. When its scales were removed, they could be made into a set of exquisite armor, and there were also a few spare shields to spare.

As a general rule, dragons possess various attack methods, such as biting, clawing, wing-beating, and tail-beating. Corresponding to these attacks are the dragon's teeth, wings, and tail, which are highly valued as dragon parts on the market. After selling these parts, Zhao Xu could even use the dragon's bones to create a magical staff.

However, no one expected this unexpected turn of events.

The white dragon did not dive down to attack them with its "Dragon's Fury" or spit out "Frosty Breath" as usual. Instead, it simply lay down on the ground, with its massive and somewhat clumsy body pressed against the ground. Its claws, which could easily tear open a giant bear's belly, gently pressed against the ground. Its sharp claws also unfolded naturally. When it swished its tail, it swayed gently, showing its humility.

"Great sorcerer, I am the humble white dragon, Sirelius, passing by. Please spare me."
Zhao Xu grasped the scepter, but the spell he was about to unleash suddenly got stuck. What kind of cowardly dragon is this?
