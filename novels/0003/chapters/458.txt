Chapter 459 Shame of the Dragon Clan
Just as Zhao Xu started to chase after the white dragon, Antinoya and Vivian also set off, using their own flying abilities to keep up.
Zhao Xu was not surprised to see the two behind him.
Since entering Mysteria and coming into contact with the "Legendary Library" on the top floor of the knowledge library, he had read the book "Secrets of the Dragons" multiple times.
The various characteristics of the five-colored dragons and the five metallic dragons were all clear to him, even without using his "knowledge" skill.
Even now, Zhao Xu could identify the type of dragon just by looking at a dried dragon without having to sniff or lick it like an expert would. With his naked eye, he could tell which kind of dragon it was.
Not to mention, the appearance of a giant dragon with wings, similar to a lizard, belonged to the category of "mysterious knowledge," which was Zhao Xu's most outstanding skill at the moment.
In order to become a legendary spellcaster in the future, he had never neglected his skills in mysterious and religious knowledge.
"Looking at this massive size, it's just a challenge level 12 adult white dragon."
Zhao Xu said as he saw the two behind him catching up.
The adult stage is the seventh of the twelve age stages of the dragon clan, and dragons between two hundred and four hundred years old are classified in this stage.
The key is that from the fifth stage of the youth period, dragons will leave their parents to establish their own nests. During this stage, if the dragons are of the evil dragon clan or have naturally low intelligence, they often lay eggs in the countryside, producing a clutch of about two to five eggs.
After these eggs hatch, the young dragons naturally take care of themselves, and a group of brothers struggle to survive. The evil white dragon, who was born with an average intelligence of 6 points and only has a little over 12 points of intelligence in his prime, is a typical example of random ovulation, which is also the reason why the common people of the Northern Alliance can see the traces of the white dragon living in the ice-capped mountains.

However weak the young dragons may be, even a pair of ordinary militia can easily kill them, they still cannot stop the existence of the great dragon, who becomes stronger with age.

Living for more than 1200 years without incident, one can become an ancient dragon challenging a level exceeding 20, which is the unreasonable strength of the dragon clan.

Even the dragon clan often has professional levels, so the current prime white dragon, with a challenge level starting at 12, seems to have only a few additional professional levels, and it is not surprising that he is close to legendary.

This is the origin of the Arthurian saying "Do not judge a dragon by its appearance."

"Do you see the details of this white dragon clearly?" Antinoya asked beside Zhao Xu.

Although the three of them were flying at high speed, the wind and snow kept coming through the front with a lot of noise, Antinoya's voice still entered the ears of the two clearly.

"I haven't gotten close enough to see," Zhao Xu said.

His level 2 ability as a spell guardian, "Arcane Vision," allows him to see magical auras within dozens of meters, including the number of spell rings that a creature can cast.

Whether this "white dragon" is a strong dragon or a winged lizard depends on the "warlock content" of the other party.

"The speed at which this dragon is fleeing is quite impressive."
Here is the translation of the text:

An'ni Nuoya looked at the white dragon, which was flapping its wings in front of her, and couldn't help but laugh. "When this white dragon was born, its scales were like mirrors, reflecting the light. How did it grow up to become so dull and unlovable?" she said.

Zhao Xu didn't respond to An'ni Nuoya's words.

Even a young dragon's strength was comparable to that of a grown man, and its attacking power was far beyond that of ordinary militia. With a single swipe of its claws, it could disembowel an ordinary person. It was impossible to find it endearing.

The dragon's abilities were stealth, camouflage, and color-changing. It could easily hide in the snow and ice, which was the reason it dared to come to the city of Auror in the midst of a heavy snowstorm.

Unfortunately, the dragon encountered An'ni Nuoya, who had skills in both reconnaissance and listening, and was able to detect its presence from over a hundred meters away.

The dragon, over 10 meters long, was still too conspicuous to An'ni Nuoya, like a big truck covered with three-color canvas.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was frantically flapping his wings, although his movements were a bit clumsy. However, his flying speed was not deceiving, and he was slowly pulling them away.

The giant dragon in front of them was flying at a normal speed, which was about 10 meters per second. If it flew at an urgent pace, it could cover over a hundred kilometers in an hour. Not to mention that the dragon's species was naturally talented and had great endurance, and it could fly for over 400 kilometers in a day without breaking a sweat.

In fact, it would be equivalent to flying across a province in a day.

An'ni Nuoya also realized this point, but Zhao Xu had just not brought the "Shadow Horse" that was even faster than the dragon.

Currently, they were relying on their own flying speed, which was maintained by the acceleration technique, and the gap would only become larger if they didn't speed up.
"Never mind, Zhongxia, you open any door and hurry to intercept it," Antinoya ordered.

At this time, Zhao Xuyu looked ahead and saw the silhouette of the White Dragon, unable to help but look back at Antinoya. "Teacher, this is a level four spell, and I don't have many left."

In reality, what he meant was that this spell should naturally be released by Antinoya.

For Zhao Xuyu, even if he counted the combination of three-ring spells to form a four-ring spell, he only had a total of 2+3=5 four-ring spell slots.

Antinoya snorted lightly. "Childish. When we get the treasure in the White Dragon's lair later, you better split it with me. This White Dragon knows how to command and control the Winter Wolves. Who knows, it might be a treasure dragon."

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xuyu felt a surge of adrenaline.

Once a dragon reaches adulthood, it will leave its parents or the mutual support of a few weak dragons in their original teenage years and begin to live on their own.

As they walk independently, out of greed for treasure, most of them will build their own unique lair.

Therefore, generally, if one can find the lair of a dragon at the young adult stage through various means, they can obtain a considerable fortune.

The White Dragon, with a fierce expression but simple thoughts, is a representative of this behavior.

Zhao Xuyu remembered that they do not understand the concept of "not putting all your eggs in one basket" and like to keep all their life's treasures in the same lair.

The lairs chosen by White Dragons are generally caves built from ice blocks, in order to reflect the sparkle of gemstones on the ice surface.

Zhao Xuyu touched his head, remembering that White Dragons are fond of diamonds.

And he was close to reaching the fifth ring, so he should prepare some diamonds for the resurrection spell. After all, Zhao Xuyu, as a child from a poor family, had to grow up early.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu's gaze converged, focusing on the spine of the white dragon's back in front of him, as if the gemstone-like luster had already taken shape.

The teleportation spell, "任意门" (Rén yì mén), is strong because it only requires linguistic elements to cast. Even if one's body is tightly bound and one's mouth is stuffed with rags, it is impossible to prevent the spell from being cast.

Unless Zhao Xu activates the "沉默术" (Chén mò shù) silence spell, which blocks the area's sound, there is no chance to intercept it.

Therefore, to paralyze a mage's spellcasting ability, it is best to use a spell like "弱智术" (Ruò zhì shù) that damages the opponent's intelligence attribute, making them unable to think of even the most basic countermeasures.

"Forward!"

Zhao Xu issued the extremely brief "咒语指令" (Zhòu yǔ jìng) spell command in this moment.

At the same time, his gaze also shifted to focus on the white dragon ahead, where it seemed that a whirlpool had formed in the snowstorm.

Zhao Xu knew that spellcasting distance can be classified into several types: contact, near-distance, middle-distance, and long-distance. The teleportation spell's distance limit is also the maximum distance Zhao Xu can transport himself.

Long-distance spells typically have a range of 120 meters, with each level extending the range by 12 meters.

Under the influence of Zhao Xu, who had surpassed 20 levels, he held onto An Ti Nao Ya with one hand and Wei Wei An with the other, instantly traversing hundreds of meters.

At this moment, the white dragon was still biting its teeth and flying with its mouth open, with saliva dripping from its jaws. However, the wind and snowstorm blowing in its face had dried up its saliva.

Suddenly, it was stunned to find that three mysterious figures had appeared in the icy world before its eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

The white dragon gazed at Zhao Xu with eyes as big as copper bells, as if it had been shocked to its core. Its massive body halted instantly, and its gigantic wings fluttered wildly. Suddenly, the dragon came to a stop right in front of Zhao Xu, as if it had slammed on the brakes.

Zhao Xu was taken aback, having just used the "Arbitrary Door" and feeling his body's stagnation dissipate. He quickly raised the super magical staff in his hand, pointing it at the white dragon in the distance. It seemed as if the destructive magic energy would burst forth at any moment.

As Zhao Xu watched the dragon's sudden braking, he began to secretly calculate in his heart.

The thought slowly took shape in his mind: "White Dragon Disassembly and Resale Plan".

This old white dragon had finally grown to an enormous size. After peeling off its dragon skin, it could be made into several exquisite armor sets, with some extra shield plates to spare.

As a typical dragon, it had various attack methods, including biting, clawing, wing attacks, and tail attacks, all of which could be sold as valuable dragon parts on the market. After selling off the dragon meat, he could even reuse the bones to create a spellcasting material.

But no one expected what happened next.

This white dragon did not dive down to pressure them with its "Dragon's Fury" or spit out a cold breath. Instead, it simply lay down on the ground, its massive body sprawled out, with its enormous belly and limbs flat against the ground.

Its sharp claws pressed gently onto the ground, and its powerful tail swished back and forth, indicating its humility.

"Great Wizard, I'm a humble little dragon named Serus, passing by. Please spare me."

Zhao Xu grasped the scepter, and the spell that was about to be unleashed suddenly stalled. What kind of cowardly dragon is this?
