Chapter 671: The Cannibal Monster! Trap! Control of Life and Death!

"'Cannibal Monster?'"

Zheng Xin Yu seemed to be unfamiliar with such a creature, and so was everyone else in the team, judging by their puzzled expressions.

The autumn wind blew fiercely, causing people's faces to feel slightly painful, but their curious gazes remained intense.

Zhao Xu's connection to the cannibal monster dated back to his past life.

As he thought back, he could still feel the intense pain from the cannibal monster's massive log hitting the back of his head.

"'The cannibal monster is a giant, chaotic, and evil being from a mixed array. It can be described as a large and ugly greedy creature. Its thick skin has prominent, developed muscles, and I've seen one with a head and neck resembling a lizard. Its body is particularly large, with a pungent smell and a dirty face.'"

"'And the cannibal monster does all kinds of shady business, relying on arson, murder, and plunder for a living. They usually cooperate with other monsters to take advantage of the weak. The cannibal monster is a tribe that understands the concept of banding together.'"

As Zhao Xu finished his description, some people quickly pulled out various rough notebooks to start recording.

Compared to the knowledge on Earth, knowledge was almost priceless, and its dissemination was almost free.

Arthur's knowledge was even more expensive, with the cost of paper and printing unable to be reduced, and the spread of knowledge was impossible to discuss.

Now, Arthur, a powerful and knowledgeable player, had transformed into a knowledge influencer.
Here is the translation:

Even the knowledge they possess about "monsters" is equivalent to the treasure code of the earth, except for a few good-hearted people who share their information, most of it is hoarded for "information trading" with others.

Although what Zhao Xu is describing now is still limited to low-level monsters, just looking at this situation, it's clear that he's going to take it all the way and provide a detailed explanation.

To put it bluntly, just taking these documents back to the base and submitting them could be exchanged for a substantial reward.

At present, the base is also assigning a series of intelligence-gathering missions, but most adventurers are too afraid to take on such tasks, relying instead on their own memories to cope.

For a moment, everyone's eyes lit up with excitement, even forgetting the impending arrival of the monster group.

Zhao Xu also seemed entranced, squatting down and continuing his lecture as he pointed to the footprint of the flesh-eating demon.

"Flesh-eating demons are inherently lazy and volatile in temperament," he said. "Their method of solving problems is limited to one: fighting and then talking. They are more beast-like than the original human tribe."

"However, they are unable to defeat those who can run away. Flesh-eating demons usually gather in small groups and occupy any convenient location to eat. They are called 'flesh-eating demons' because they eat everything, snatching or hunting their prey, and then devouring it without hesitation."

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly as he spoke, "However, it's also because of this delicious trait that flesh-eating demons sometimes work for evil, humanoid beings, including humans."

"What are the characteristics of flesh-eating demons other than their height and weight?"

Zheng Xin allowed also seemed to return to his high school textbook, seriously taking notes as he thoughtfully listened to Zhao Xu's explanation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Their skin color is usually dark yellow to dark brown, and they won't appear naked. Most of them have random patches of fur, but since they don't wash themselves, they smell even worse."

As Zhao Xu pointed to the footprint, "Even with a keen sense of smell, you can sometimes judge how long ago the opponent left by the lingering scent."

"Regarding combat, flesh eaters prefer a guaranteed victory, so many adventurers who encounter them often find themselves ambushed or caught off guard. Fortunately, flesh eaters are familiar with ranged attacks like archery and siege warfare, but they lack discipline and can easily become disorganized."

Zhao Xu then analyzed the details of flesh eaters, starting from their habits and common traps.

This small team of ten people felt a momentary sense of unease, as if they were facing a traitor from their own kind, meticulously dissecting their own racial weaknesses.

It wasn't until Zheng Xin'an remembered to ask, with a hint of confusion, "Captain, can we beat these monsters?"

"Not likely," Zhao Xu glanced at the average level of the team.

It's fair to say that most people have no connection to the "odd encounter".

Zhao Xu even couldn't see any magical sparks or bring any alchemy tools, which was already impressive.

"Against flesh eaters with high physical strength and explosive power, it's often difficult to kill them with a single blow. If they take a beating, even a sturdy dwarf warrior might not be able to withstand it. So, when we really engage in combat, it's best to weaken them with magic first."

The people finally realized that Zhao Xu basically approaches difficult problems with three sentences: magic.

These seemingly insignificant mages in low-level battles seem to be a crucial part.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu finished introducing, the group paused for a moment and decided to avoid the direction with the "cannibal" footprint and head towards another direction in the woods.

According to the information gathered by the wandering group at the beginning, this route was cleared by a group of 40 adventurers just four days ago, and they safely returned at dawn.

This proved that the route had some degree of safety.

Zhao Xu only played the role of a strong "knowledge retriever" in terms of strategic decision-making, and he didn't need to bring along his daughter, allowing him to hope that the small team would fight three battles in one day and consume all their supplies, reaching the point of being trapped in the mountains with no way out.

At the same time, Zhao Xu also thought that the team of ten or so people would not be as easily suppressed as a team of 40 people, and would not be able to sneak away quietly like a team of four people, making it easy to stir up a commotion and attract the attention of monsters.

When encountering danger, some people would definitely be unable to escape, and Zhao Xu could allow his daughter to face the test of life and death.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "Ah, my innate talent for leading the team has been further enhanced."

As he finished speaking, the group was in a receptive state, and the signs of monsters began to appear. Zhao Xu quietly waved his hand and began to cast a spell.

Who would have thought he was such a good person?

Four-ring spell, high-level perception!

With Zhao Xu's expertise in "distance casting" spellcasting, he did not need to physically touch anyone and successfully cast the spell on the 10 or so people present.

At this point, he was the only mage, so there was no need to worry that someone would use "detection magic" to discover any clues.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like when he was exploring the underground cave, his "Perception" skill had already allowed him to sense the directions, distances, and situations of all his companions in his mind.

At this moment, a small map of the MOBA game appeared on his retinal surface, suspended with the headshots of over ten people in the team.

Thanks to his 33rd-level Mage skill, he could cast a spell that affected everyone with just one touch, whereas other Mages could only cast a spell that affected three people at most.

As Zhao Xu looked at the small map with his left eye and the detailed status panels of each person with his right eye.

At this moment, the list of all people's statuses showed that only "Uninjured" was bright, while the other ten or so negative statuses such as "Injured", "Paralyzed", "Dazed", "Unconscious", "Critical", "Nauseous", "Panicked", "Dizzy", "Poisoned", "Sick", and "Confused" were all rendered in dark gray.

Moreover, the higher-level "Scrying" skill of the fourth circle allowed Zhao Xu to use his skills of the second circle or below at any time.

The most typical example was the "Healing X Damage" spell.

This spell could take effect as long as everyone was in the same plane.

Even Zhao Xu could hide and become a remote healer, restoring the status of everyone at any time, and it was truly impressive.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking this, his footsteps suddenly slowed down, but then quickly returned to normal.

Even an observant master could not detect the slightest psychological fluctuation in Zhao Xu at this moment.

In that instant, the "Detection XX" spell, which could last for 10 hours and was delayed for 10 minutes, told him that something was amiss.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Detection Trap" spell can reveal simple pitfalls, traps, and snares made from natural materials, as well as natural hazards such as sandstorms and rock caves. However, it is ineffective against complex traps like living door traps. Now, Zhao Xun remained silent. He simply raised two fingers and concealed all signs of the spell, knowing the true result of the trap ahead. He then continued to remain silent.

At this moment, the scout in front was completely unaware of the dry leaves under his feet, which were unusually thick. If he had started to search for traps in a slow and painstaking manner, he would have been exhausted, and even the scout's energy would not be able to withstand it. Therefore, it is often better to use special methods to force one's way through.

For example, Zhao Xun could summon a hidden servant to carry a pack. The scout's solo exploration was sometimes a necessary evil. Or, in the midst of an adventure, dying in a trap was one of the scout's fates.

"Aiya!"
A faint creaking sound echoed through the air, and the young scout's face turned pale. He quickly performed a mid-air transformation, attempting to open Newton's coffin and jump out of the trap's range.

Fake trap pit!
Zhao Xun's brain seemed to replay the details like a loop.
Such as a 20-level reflective avoidance, mechanical trap, position-triggered trap, 3-4 meter depth estimation, 24-level search difficulty, and 20-level dismantling device difficulty. A series of key words flashed through his mind.

It was as if the entire world was a cold, emotionless data stream in his mind, devoid of any warmth or color. And when the crowd's cries of surprise erupted.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The dodger himself is agile and has the ability to dodge attacks. In theory, he is the most likely person to successfully dodge traps besides Zhao Xu and the wandering guest. However, he didn't hesitate and recklessly jumped forward, landing awkwardly in front of him. Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile slightly.

Most people's instinct would be to retreat, but that would go against the momentum of their forward movement, making it difficult to dodge the trap. A well-made trap will trigger only when you reach the center of it, so trying to force your way out of it may lead to falling into the trap instead. The dodger was filled with determination as he rolled forward, but Zhao Xu had just glanced over and saw it all.

The dodger's intention was to catch food, and as a cannibal, he wouldn't hesitate to eat people who got stuck in the trap. The reason he placed three sharp bamboo sticks in the trap was that it was a linked trap. When the dodger finally landed safely and felt the ground beneath him, he couldn't help but exhale in relief.

However, a loud scream erupted from the team, and the dodger was taken aback to see that three iron spears had already pierced his chest at the moment the trap was triggered.

There was no way to avoid it!
Zhao Xu shook his head in disappointment.

It's a flying spear trap!
This is a long-range attack with a level of 12 or above.
At this moment, it looks like all three spears have penetrated the dodger's chest.
He had no chance of survival.
"Treat light injuries!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly unleashed a spell, one that was invisible to everyone's eyes. A life force directly poured into the wandering warrior's chest.

Originally, the three-edged sword was about to strike, and in an instant, it could have knocked the wandering warrior down, even to the point of being on the brink of death at -10 below, and even directly leading to a violent death.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly intervened, and using his strength, he forced the wandering warrior to stay alive.

Moreover, Zhao Xu did not use the second ring's "healing moderate injury" spell, otherwise, the opponent might have jumped up and become more powerful, scaring the team members.

Zhao Xu's intention was not to protect everyone at the cost of a risk-free leveling, but to let Zheng Xin'an experience the feeling of death on the brink of life and death.

Therefore, he used this spell to keep the wandering warrior in a state of near-death coma, but not quite dead.

Instantly, the entire team let out a collective cry of despair.

"Dragon!"

"Little Dragon!"

In an instant, several team members who had befriended the wandering warrior couldn't help but rush forward, trying to rescue him!

But Zhao Xu's gaze remained cold, and he slightly glanced at the team leader, Big Hammer Ku, who had also clearly lost his composure.

This was no longer the "game" they had once known!

"Hold on! There might be traps!" Zheng Xin'an shouted on the spot.

Her eyes also finally revealed a look of terror, as she heard the sound of death's footsteps.
