Chapter 671: Man-Eating Monster! Trap! Life and Death Control!

"'Man-Eating Monster?'"

Zheng Xin Yin seemed to have little knowledge about this kind of monster, nor did she and the entire team, whose eyes were filled with puzzlement.

The autumn wind blew fiercely, making people's faces ache, but their inquiring gazes remained fervent.

Zhao Xu had a connection with the man-eating monster that went back to his past life.

As he thought back, he could still feel the intense pain in the back of his head from the man-eating monster's giant wooden club.

"'A man-eating monster is a type of giant, evil humanoid with a large and ugly body. Its thick skin is covered in developed muscles, and I've seen one with a head and neck that looks like a lizard. They have a particularly strong body odor and are notorious for their brutal behavior. They make a living by burning, killing, and looting, and usually collaborate with other monsters to bully the weak. Seeing the silhouette of a man-eating monster means that there are likely to be man-eating witch, evil giants, and other monsters nearby.'"

As Zhao Xu finished his description, several people quickly pulled out various makeshift notebooks to record their notes.

Compared to the knowledge on Earth, knowledge on this planet was much more valuable, with a price approaching free.

Arthur's knowledge was even more expensive, with the cost of paper and printing unable to be reduced, and the dissemination of knowledge was virtually impossible.

Now, Arthur, a powerful and knowledgeable player, had transformed into a knowledge celebrity.
Even the knowledge they have mastered about "monsters" is already equivalent to the wealth code on Earth. Apart from a few kind-hearted individuals sharing it, most of it is kept waiting for "information trading" with others.
Although at this moment Zhao Xu's narration is still limited to low-level monsters, looking at this situation, it is clear that the entire nature is going to be made clear again and even further.
To exaggerate a bit, just taking this information back to hand over to the camp can exchange for a substantial reward.
At least the camp still has a series of intelligence exploration tasks hanging, but most adventurers dare not easily take them on, mostly relying on their own original memories to cope.
At that moment, everyone was also eagerly looking forward to it, and even forgot about the possibility of an incoming group of monsters at any time.
Zhao Xu also became somewhat absorbed, he squatted down and continued to speak, pointing to the footprint of the ogre.
"Ogres are lazy and irritable creatures, with only one way to solve problems, which is to fight first and then talk. It can be said that they have more animalistic traits than the primitive orc clan."
"But they are still unable to beat those who know how to escape. Ogres usually gather into small groups, occupying any convenient place for food. And the reason they are named 'ogres' is because these creatures eat anything, whether it's grabbed, hunted, or killed, they will swallow it without hesitation."
Saying this, Zhao Xu frowned slightly, "But also because of their love for food, sometimes ogres are also hired by evil humanoid creatures, including humans."
"Besides their height and weight, what other characteristics do ogres have?"
Zheng Xinyun also seemed to return to the serious note-taking appearance in high school, carefully pondering Zhao Xu's explanation.
"Their skin color generally ranges from dark yellow to dark brown, and they don't go around naked. Most of them have fur sewn together haphazardly, but because they don't change or wash it, their bodies emit a strong odor."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he pointed to the footprints, "If you have a keen sense of smell, you can even determine how long ago the other party left based on the residual odor."

"As for combat, ogres like battles that they are guaranteed to win, so when many adventurers encounter ogres, they often fall into a state of ambush or surprise attacks. Fortunately, although ogres understand how to use long-range methods such as bows and arrows or throwing stones to weaken their opponents, they still lack discipline and are easily scattered."

Zhao Xu then analyzed the details of ogres' habits and some common traps, starting from the characteristics of these monsters.

At this moment, this team of more than ten people had a strange feeling, as if they were facing an ogre spy, dissecting the weaknesses of their own race bit by bit.

It wasn't until later that Zheng Xinyun remembered feeling a bit dizzy and confused, and she looked at the captain with a hint of doubt, "Captain, can we defeat these monsters?"

"It's difficult," Zhao Xu glanced at the average level of the team.

It can be said that the vast majority of them have no connection to "adventures" at all.

He couldn't even see any magical brilliance in the entire team. Being able to bring a few alchemical items was already outstanding.

"For creatures like ogres, with large size, high strength, and high explosiveness, it's often difficult to kill them with a single blow. Once they start hitting, even a sturdy dwarf warrior might not be able to withstand it. So if we really start fighting, it's best to use spells to weaken them first."

It was only then that everyone realized that Zhao Xu basically never strayed from using spells to deal with difficult problems.

These seemingly inconspicuous mages on the low-level battlefield seemed to be crucial.
Here is the translation of the text:

After Zhao Xu finished explaining, the group pondered for a moment and decided to avoid the direction with the "eater of humans" footprints and instead head towards another direction in the abandoned forest.

According to the information obtained by the wanderer at the beginning, this route was recently opened by an adventure team of forty people, who safely returned at dawn.

This proved that this route had a certain level of safety.

Zhao Xu only played the role of a strong "knowledge retriever" and was silent on strategic decision-making matters.

To be blunt, the whole process went smoothly, and he didn't need to bring A'er out. He hoped that this small team would fight three times and exhaust all their supplies, becoming trapped in a desperate situation.

Initially, he agreed to join this team because of its small size.

More than ten people would not be as easily intimidated as a team of forty, and their large size would not be able to sneak away quietly like a team of four, making it easy to stir up a commotion and attract the attention of monsters.

When encountering danger, some people would inevitably not be able to escape, and at that time, he could let A'er face a test between life and death.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that his leadership talent had been further enhanced.

As he just finished explaining, the group was in a receptive state, and the monster's signs of appearance were becoming apparent. Zhao Xu also quietly waved his hand and began to cast a spell.

Who would have thought that he was a good person.

Four-ring spell, high-level perception spell!

With Zhao Xu's "long-distance spellcasting" expertise being put into effect, he didn't need to personally touch anyone to cast this spell on the more than ten people present.

At this moment, he was the only mage, so there was no need to worry that someone would use "detect magic" to discover anything.
Just like when he was exploring the underground caves before, the second-level observation technique allowed him to feel the direction, distance, and condition of all his companions in his heart.

At this moment, it seemed as if a mini-map from a Moba game appeared on his retinas, with the avatars of more than ten people in the team floating on it.

It's a good thing that he was a level 33 spellcaster, as he needed to be at least level 33 in order to cast a spell that could affect everyone in the team. If it were another spellcaster, at most they could only cast a spell to affect three people at a time. To cover everyone, they would probably use up all their fourth-level spell slots.

With his left eye seeing the mini-map and his right eye seeing the specific status panel of each person, he could see that the only bright status in everyone's list was "uninjured." The other ten or so negative statuses, such as injured, paralyzed, dazed, unconscious, dying, nauseous, panicked, dizzy, poisoned, sick, and confused, were all completely dark.

At the same time, with the fourth-level advanced observation, compared to the second-level observation, Zhao Xu could at any time use this observation status to cast second-level and lower-level "touch" spells.

The most typical example is the healing spell for X injuries. And this spell could be effective as long as everyone was still on the same plane. Even Zhao Xu could hide himself and act as a long-range healer, ready to restore everyone's status at any time, making him an outstanding figure.

Just as Zhao Xu was pondering this, suddenly his footsteps slightly paused, but immediately returned to normal. Even a master of subtle observation would not be able to detect any psychological fluctuations from Zhao Xu at this moment.

In this brief moment, the spells of "detecting traps" from the "detect XX" spells that he had cast, which lasted for ten minutes and could be extended to ten hours, instantly told him that something was wrong!
Here is the translation of the text:

The detection spell "侦测陷阱" can reveal simple pitfalls, traps, and snares, as well as mechanical traps made of natural materials, and even natural hazards such as quicksand and rock crevices. However, it is ineffective against magical traps and complex traps, such as living door traps.

At this moment, Zhao Xu remained silent, his eyes fixed on the front. He simply raised his two fingers and cast a spell to erase all evidence, only to reveal the true result of the trap ahead. Then, he kept silent again.

As the vanguard walked ahead, he didn't notice the thick, unnatural layer of fallen leaves on the ground. If he had, he would have noticed the trap. But he was too slow and too weak. Therefore, it was better to use special means to force their way through.

For instance, Zhao Xu summoned a hidden servant to carry a backpack. This was also a necessary measure for the vanguard to clear the path. Sometimes, it was inevitable that the vanguard would fall into traps.

As the vanguard suddenly heard a faint creaking sound, his face turned pale, and he quickly changed into an acrobatic pose, trying to open the trapdoor and jump out of the trap.

It was a fake trap! Zhao Xu's mind replayed the details like a video. For example, the difficulty of dodging the trap was 20 levels, the mechanical trap, location-triggered, depth estimated to be 3-4 meters, search difficulty 24 levels, and disarming device difficulty 20 levels.

It was as if the entire world was reduced to a string of cold, emotionless data in his mind. And in the instant when the crowd's cries echoed through the air...
Here is the translation of the text:

The dodger himself is agile and has the ability to dodge even more skillfully. In theory, he is the most likely person to successfully dodge the trap, except for Zhao Xu and the wandering guest. However, he didn't hesitate and forcefully flipped forward with a bit of awkwardness.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but smile slightly.

The general reaction would be to retreat quickly, but this would contradict the forward momentum, making it difficult to dodge the trap. A well-made trap would trigger only when the center is reached, making it difficult to avoid falling into the trap. Even a careless mistake could lead to falling into the trap and getting hurt badly.

The dodger was filled with determination as he flipped forward, showing courage and hope.

However, Zhao Xu had just taken a glance.

The dodger had been hunting for food and didn't have the luxury of being cautious, so he could easily insert a few sharpened bamboo sticks into the trap. The reason was that this was a chain trap.

As the dodger successfully landed and felt that he was no longer falling, he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

Another scream echoed through the team.

But the dodger was only startled to look up, only to find that three iron spears had already been launched at him at the moment the trap was triggered, and they were now piercing his chest.

There was no way to avoid it!

Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head.

It's a flying spear trap!
A level 12 or above long-range attack skill.
As it stands, the three spears are all lodged in the dodger's chest.
He had no chance of survival.
"Light wound treatment!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu suddenly cast a spell, and a stream of life energy directly flowed into the chest of the wandering warrior from an angle that no one could see. Originally, the three blades were aligned, and in an instant, he could have knocked this wandering warrior to the ground, even pulling his life force to a level below -10, resulting in a direct death.

However, Zhao Xu held back. He didn't use the "Medium-Degree Healing" spell from the second ring spell, otherwise, the opponent might have jumped back to life and frightened his teammates. Zhao Xu was not here to protect everyone at all costs, nor was he here to level up with no risk.

He wanted to let Zheng Xin'an experience the feeling of death in this life-or-death situation. Therefore, he used this spell to control the wandering warrior on the brink of death, without letting him die.

Instantly, the entire team let out a collective cry of despair!

"Dragon!" "Little Dragon!"

Several of the warriors who were friendly with the wandering warrior couldn't help but rush forward, trying to rescue him!

Only Zhao Xu's gaze remained cold, gazing at the team leader, Big Hammer Ku, who seemed to be stunned. This was no longer the game they used to play!

"Stop! We can't rule out traps!" Zheng Xin'an shouted loudly.

Her eyes also finally showed her fear, and she had heard the sound of death's footsteps.
