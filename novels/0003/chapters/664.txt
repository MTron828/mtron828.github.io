Chapter 665: Infinite Loop, True and False Worlds

"Summer, you're too anxious,"

"This instant, you're not using 'True Knowledge' to observe me, are you?"

Standing opposite Zhao Xu, Annyoja countered, her tone remaining light and slow, without the slightest hint of being misunderstood and needing to explain hastily.

"We can rely on the magic in our hands."

"If there really is magic that can deceive True Knowledge, it would have long been passed down and would not have been transmitted until today."

As Annyoja's tone grew heavier, she said, "Not to mention the demon sealed in this area also cannot stop your 'spirit shield' before attacking you."

"Whether it's magic or the means to counter magic, none of it will break free from the rules. It is precisely because of the existence of these rules that we wizards can rely on the rules to influence this world."

"Just like the 'Soul Binding' and 'Canine Feast' you just released, aren't they all within the scope of magic to eliminate the possibility of the opponent's revival?"

"If you didn't believe the result from the beginning, why bother going to such lengths?"

Annyoja's words pierced Zhao Xu's heart.

If he didn't even believe the basic effects of magic, then what's the point of relying on magic?

Unbeknownst to Annyoja, Zhao Xu was currently steadfast, as if all his pores were tightly sealed.

If willpower could take shape, he would undoubtedly be surrounded by layers of spiritual barriers.

"First, let's correct one thing: according to the 'Demon King Device' I once encountered in a certain underground location, they indeed exist beyond the boundaries of magic."

Here is the translation of the text:

"Next, the entire magical system is not perfect, which is why we need to continuously innovate and make up for it. If all rules are set in stone and unchangeable, then we can just stick to the old incantations and live life lazily."

"The death magic zone is a rule that cannot be broken in the entire magical network architecture. Mages are still creating 'call of magical power' which can cause a fleeting burst of magical energy, allowing them to cast the nine-ring magic of the four-ring magic, and it can also ignore the rule that cannot be broken in the anti-magic zone."

"If one day, there is a spell that can ignore the effects of true knowledge, as long as it is still within the entire magical system, then the system will not collapse."

"Our faith as mages will not collapse."

"...then the legendary mage's mentor said to me, 'Respect the achievements of past magic, surpass the achievements of past magic.'"

"So, I'm suspicious that you, who looks like my mentor, Ana誰s Nox, are not my real mentor Ana誰s Nox, what's the question?"

As Zhao Xu's questioning voice echoed, Ana誰s Nox's face changed slightly in the green glow.

"Very interesting, indeed very interesting."

However, she continued to deceive, and her radiant hands directly grasped the long sword that had turned back into a person from Heaven's Gate, and she gripped the sword hilt with force.

"If you believe your judgment, then you can just go ahead and stab me with your sword."

It was as if private whispering in the night sky, Ana誰s Nox's seductive words resounded, like a flickering candle flame burning Zhao Xu's heart.

"Midsummer, this is my latest test for you."

"Judgment of mages represents responsibility."
Here is the translation of the given text:

"In times of crisis in the city-state, is it better to use magic to prevent a flood or to let it happen and use magic to rescue the disaster-stricken people and reduce the number of casualties?"

"This world has never had unnecessary empty talk."

"I can tolerate your question just now, but it's only a means of reconfirming true or false."

"If you make a mistake in your judgment, then I, who is very disappointed, will inevitably take back the ability you have now."

"A sudden gust of wind blew through Anniya's body, and the darkness around her seemed to be swallowed up. The originally weak light cave scenery was transformed into a void. Everything disappeared instantly.

At this moment, there were only two people standing on the bottom of the lake, whose clear and pure surface reflected their figures. Because of being stepped on lightly, it kept generating ripples.

The "curse fire" energy originating from the magical network spread throughout Anniya's body, forming a web that was constantly woven.

Zhao Xu's "silver fire" energy also burst forth involuntarily, resonating with the energy similar to the source.

Even Zhao Xu's "magical site" energy was excited, as if it were calling out and praising through every pore of his body.

Gradually, Zhao Xu's silver fire began to combine with the curse fire on Anniya's body, interweaving to form a new web with blue and white stripes.

The silver fire is from the energy of the goddess of magic.

The curse fire is from the energy of the magical network's source.

Even among the goddess's chosen people, it is extremely rare for someone to be able to wield the curse fire, and in each generation, only one person can awaken to it.

Anniya told Zhao Xu this personally, and Zhao Xu believed it deeply, and it was now repeatedly stabbing at his heart."
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, he seemed to be muttering to himself, as if he was trying to convince himself to accept this new reality. Even the mightiest demon lords in the depths of the abyss couldn't simulate the kind of "curse fire" energy he possessed. Let alone the fact that relying solely on "silver fire" would be impossible.

After a long time, Zhao Xu finally lifted his head, gazing silently at the opposite An Ni Yao.

"Zhong Xia, have you made up your mind?" he asked.

"Yes," she replied.

Zhao Xu's head twitched slightly, and his grip on the long sword in his hand tightened.

"Before making the final decision, may I ask you one more question?" he suddenly asked.

"Of course, Zhong Xia. No matter how many questions you ask, I'll be happy to answer them. But I hope your questions aren't just a delaying tactic," An Ni Yao said.

"You're a mage, and you're also a man. I believe you have enough courage to make your own decision. It's a matter of principle, do you understand?"

At this moment, An Ni Yao's tone was as fleeting and empty as the first spring rain.

"So, what was our first sentence when we first met?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Greetings, Mr. Zhong Xia," An Ni Yao replied.

"Of course, that's a common response. So, I can recite the next sentence - 'Hello, I'm your mentor for the mage training course, An Ni Yao. This period will be assisted by me to help you complete your mage profession training.'"

An Ni Yao's voice remained clear and melodious.

At this point, Zhao Xu's face also relaxed, and he smiled.

But the next instant, he seemed to be releasing all his energy, as if his blood vessels were bursting, and he was about to unleash all his remaining strength in this very moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Instant Creation Method: 18 Lucky Points, all infused into the attack!
This sword, Zhang Xu's attack level, suddenly jumped from a total of 49 levels to a staggering 67 levels!
With the Long Sword in his hand, relying on the Ghost Strike Technique, he can ignore all "armor" and "natural shields", and directly block the defense of countless people!
It can be said that even if he were to transform into a divine being, without using special means, he would still be pierced through by the power of this single strike!
However, this incredibly fierce and explosive sword strike was barely able to touch the chest of Annithony.
Until the sword was bent and emitted a clear and crisp sound, Zhang Xu was unable to make any progress at all.
He couldn't even penetrate his opponent's body.
He could even feel that this was not a 100% defensive technique like the "Wings of Protection".
It was just that he had blocked his attack with his basic defensive abilities.
"'Is this your answer?' Annithony asked softly.
"'I must say, you're acting like my teacher, but your appearance is not at all like it, and it's too ugly to look at.' Zhang Xu gritted his teeth.

He had already realized that his opponent's technique had exceeded his imagination.
A being who could even mimic a spell like "Inferno" would not have any doubts, even if he were a divine being.
He even suspected that his opponent might be the "Demonic God" buried deep in the earth.

"'Can you tell me what made you come to this conclusion?'"

Annithony, standing straight and unflappable, did not show any signs of anger or annoyance, but instead asked with great interest."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's very simple because I traveled back in time over a thousand years and met my mentor. So, when we met at Mistral and I became a wizard, it wasn't our first meeting."

"You're telling me everything that happened that day with such precision, it's too fake. Even I couldn't recall it so accurately without using memory reading magic or visual regression magic."

"But you're acting like you're absolutely confident, even going so far as to tell me something that might not even be accurate, which suggests that your suspicions are quite large."

Anzinoa shook her head at this point, "You're just making things up, it's too fake. As a wizard with intelligence far surpassing that of ordinary people, it's not impossible for me to recall things precisely after deliberately recalling them."

"Furthermore, I can use magic to read my own memories, which is not a difficult task. So, your suspicions are completely unfounded."

As Anzinoa spoke, her tone turned cold and stern, "This means that you've been judging me from the beginning, but you still won't tell me what you've seen."

Anzinoa suddenly licked her pink tongue and lightly licked her lips.

"This has left me extremely curious, what did you see that made you so confident and certain?"

"Every legendary wizard has their own unique characteristics, and anything they do is full of unmeasurable qualities, so even if I'm being dramatic today, it falls within the rational range, and you won't be able to judge me from my words."

As she spoke, she raised her head in a daze, looking at the completely dark and unseeable sky.

"Can you tell me now?"

"Oh?"

Zhao Xiu sneered, "Not kidding?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"As for trying to change someone's stubborn idea, it's a futile effort. Even if I were to prove anything to you, you would automatically interpret it as my 'ability' within the scope of my magic."

"However, you, who are not inherently obstinate, are able to make such a judgment, which is what truly piques my curiosity."

As she spoke, Anzefiya bowed her head, gazing directly at Zhao Xiu.

"How did you manage to do it, even when you're thinking clearly, yet I can't read your genuine thoughts?"

At this moment, Zhao Xiu finally let out a sigh of relief.

"I understand that you've acknowledged that you're a fake Anzefiya."

"Back then, the sword in my hand also flaunted my ability."

As he spoke, he shook his head, saying, "You're too disgusting. You can read the opponent's consciousness and then counter with real-time adjustments."

"That's right."

Anzefiya, with her slender physique, released the long sword she had just grasped, and her palm remained spotless and smooth, with no sign of the sword's blade.

"It seems that you have experience with similar tactics. You must be referring to the 'Demonic Device' you mentioned earlier. Who would have thought that there are such powerful entities in other worlds that can replicate such tactics?"

As she spoke, she shook her head in disbelief, saying, "Could it be that there are entities that can unravel the mysteries of the 'Brain in the Jar'?"

Hearing this, Zhao Xiu couldn't help but shudder for a few moments.

The Brain in the Jar!
If someone has lived their entire life within a logically consistent world from childhood to adulthood, how can they doubt the world they're in is fake?

Human beings can verify their vision through touch.
Here is the translation:

But when even tactile sensations can be fabricated, visual perception will be misled. This is also a process of developing illusions, from initially misleading "visual perception" to later "sensory misleading". "What's going on?" At this moment, Anzhiya looked at Zhao Xu with a calm expression, unable to help but ask. "Heh heh." Zhao Xu coldly smiled. "Do you think I'll tell you now?" "Isn't this just throwing myself into a trap?" "Wait, I'll simulate an Anzhiya appearance, save you, and then bring you back to the original Arthurian world." "Like this, after eliminating the loophole, how can I know what's true and what's not?" Zhao Xu calmly pointed out this point at this moment.

Living in a world of illusions, even he "dissociates" from this point, and doesn't know what's real or not. It's like waking up from a dream, actually just dreaming this scene, still in the dream state. This is the "unresolved cycle" of this moment's circumstances.

Anzhiya nodded slightly at this moment, "Unfortunately, from your words, I sense that what just happened may not have a real loophole." "I can't read your emotional changes, which means you may not have found it from the beginning. Otherwise, you would definitely have been unable to think about so many things at the time."

Zhao Xu heard this and was momentarily taken aback, unable to refute it. "Idiot." At this moment, the familiar voice of Anzhiya rang out again from behind Zhao Xu. This time, the two Anzhiyas stood facing each other, one in front and one behind.
