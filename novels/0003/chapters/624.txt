Chapter 625: Riding the Three Continents, Wide-Ranging Propagation

As soon as the cry of "Charge!" burst forth, Zhao Xu noticed that the most difficult "Step" of the Nine Swords system had already been integrated into his body.

The next moment, Zhao Xu quietly pressed his hand against his heavy sword.

Instantly, a fierce and intense aura erupted, causing the players in front of him to think that Zhong Xia was quietly casting a spell, creating a stage that could shake the hearts of the audience.

At this time, players had lost their force field, and all control spells could take effect on each individual. Even codenames had someone kneel down to lick Zhao Xu's action, and there was nothing strange about it. Players at least had the ability to rely on their immunity and spell resistance, and ordinary people could only be treated like a blank sheet, allowing them to be oppressed.

In the initial stage without order, it was more about testing the inner strength of each mage.

Slowly, everyone began to subtly sense that their inner hearts seemed to have been ignited with confidence and the spirit of martial arts.

Even two mages had a kind of desire to take up their weapons and launch a crushing charge.

However, only Zhao Xu had a visible aura with a diameter of 20 meters, covering the surrounding area, and continuously spreading towards the periphery.

He muttered to himself in silence.

From the mouth of the undefeated elder, he knew that one of the three major schools of the Nine Swords, "White Crow," was born for battle.

But truly experiencing it was from this moment on.

This school believes that strategy, leadership, and detailed planning can defeat an enemy's individual exceptional abilities with a comprehensive approach.
Here is the translation:

The White Swan spirit, which is seemingly weak, takes the initiative to charge forward with a single step. As for the people in the cave, they are still unaware of this. If they were to launch a similar charge, they would be able to deal damage to the martial artists of the level 5 martial arts level (5) damage.

This fixed damage may seem inferior to the "Holy Sword" (2D6:2-12 damage) or the "Divine" enchantment (2D6:2-12 damage) that adds +2 value. However, the key point is that it can cut through both good and evil.

Furthermore, fixed damage can increase in proportion to the multiplication of damage. At this moment, everyone is looking at Zhao Xiu with expectant eyes, even though they all know that he is the strongest player and mage in Asia. However, the expectation of his role in this regard has never decreased.

In this desolate wasteland, the critical situation has greatly increased the importance of "strength". So, Zhao Xiu is also feeling the strengthening method of this charge, feeling its power while shaking his head in secret.

As it turns out, in terms of dealing damage, Zhao Xiu is also a skilled hand.

"Charge!" Zhao Xiu said, looking at the young man who was being questioned by his sister, "Do you know what a charge is?"

For a moment, the person being looked up to by himself was stared at by his eyes, and the young man was excited inwardly. He stuttered and replied, "Hello, Mr. Zhongxia, my name is Ma Yu Fan, a 3rd-level warrior, specializing in guns, 1st-level specialized in..."
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the young man Ma Yu Fan seemed to be giving a self-introduction, meticulously describing his character traits. After his sister pushed him, he finally snapped out of his reverie and hurriedly interrupted, "Sorry, I'm too nervous." "It's okay," Zhao Xu'an consoled him.

He was still processing the complex information in his mind and needed some time to calm down. The young man's reaction was like a lower-class person who had been struggling for years and finally got a chance to rise to the top, desperately trying to seize this opportunity to showcase himself, which led to his posture changing.

However, no one was criticizing him. This was also the young man's chance to demonstrate his skills.

After taking a deep breath, the young man slowly spoke up, "Charging and 'continuous attack' are both combat techniques that require learning." "There's no mistake, in Arthur, accelerating while charging and launching an attack is called a 'charging strike', not 'charging'."

"Executing a standard charging battle technique will cause the defense to drop by about 2 levels, but the attack launched immediately after charging can increase the power by 2 levels. Since charging can significantly accelerate, we often adopt charging as a means of attacking distant monsters."

"However, charging also has its own weaknesses, such as being unable to launch a full-round 'continuous attack' afterwards, and it's hard to stop charging at will. It's easy to get trapped in a difficult situation."

At this point, the young warrior and Zhao Xu'an regained their composure, "Charging itself is a system, and one of the most famous points is that when riding a mount and charging with a long spear, it can deal double damage."
Here is the translation:

The price is 10 gold coins, and the "long gun" with a longer range, although its damage range is 1-6 (1D6), but once it hits the vital spot, it will cause a "critical hit", which is three times the damage, plus the additional damage from the long gun charge.

The critical hit from the long gun charge can cause four times the damage, which is also the reason why various forces will form long gun cavalry units, stable double damage and critical four times' power, which can even be used to surround and kill powerful warriors, and it's hard to predict the outcome.

Ultimately, there are a few lucky ones who can penetrate the defense, and their four times damage may be decisive.

As the young warrior said, he looked back at the finely crafted long gun weighing over 300 gold coins on his back, with a sentimental expression.

"Where is your warhorse?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

As a holy warrior, they receive a heavenly mount from the heavens after reaching level 5, which is also a crucial profession ability.

Warriors, on the other hand, have to buy their own mounts.

The young warrior smiled wryly, "We can't summon warhorses like holy warriors do, and those warhorses are still in the stable in the northern alliance."

"This reward for this adventure is one of the tasks, so my sister and I came down."

Zhao Xu didn't expect it to be such an embarrassing reason.

It turns out that it's because of the fixed assets that can't be carried, after all, not everyone can move the entire lake.

"Mr. Zhongxiao, the charge is exceptional due to the characteristics of the long gun, but we don't like using long guns, what do we do?" a barbarian player suddenly raised his hand, with a deep scar on his face and a heavy hammer in his hand.

At this moment, the young warrior turned around and said, "I specialize in charging with strong force, and any weapon can cause double damage, and the long gun can cause triple damage."
The barbarian suddenly laughed bitterly and shook his head, saying, "Brother, the premise of 'mounted combat' is to master 'riding combat' (avoiding attacks on horses) and 'rapid charging' (attacking and then charging again). These two skills are not worth the cost of two specializations." 

Mounted combat, rapid charging, and charging are the standard three-in-one set, and only by mastering the first can one grasp the second. However, even the warrior's clan does not have this specialization.

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhao Xiu actually understood what he was getting at and nodded directly, saying, "Actually, there is a way."

"What?" 

Everyone was immediately lifted by his interest, and the benefits of mounted charging were well-known to everyone. However, the problems of weapons, specializations, and mounts were all a perfect impediment to each person.

"Equipment can solve many problems," Zhao Xiu said. "The 'Warrior's Halter' worn on the horse's face, which costs 9,000 gold coins, can provide 'mounted combat'. If you already have it, it will directly upgrade to 'rapid charging'."

"The 'Cavalry Boots' on the foot, worth 12,000 gold coins, automatically obtain the 'rapid charging' specialization. If you already have the 'charging' specialization, each time you have three opportunities to increase the critical hit of the long gun to four times."

"Wow." The boy who listened couldn't help but smile, and other players also saw the value.

The long gun itself has a fourfold critical hit damage, and adding the threefold charging damage, that's six times! (1 standard + 3 critical hit increase + 2 charging increase)

Just as Zhao Xiu finished speaking, he shook his head, saying, "Riding is itself a stream of charging, but it doesn't represent the true essence of charging."

As he spoke, he looked up and scanned the faces of everyone.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was as if the old man's entire history of pride had been shattered.

...and the old man, Wén Bù Fǎ, who was hiding deep in the earth, suddenly changed his expression.

He felt the trembling of the ancient sword, "Transmission", in his hand.

At that moment, his expression changed dramatically!

"How is this possible?" he exclaimed. "How can that young man grasp the White Crow's Assault Art in just a few minutes? Even more astonishing is that he has triggered the resonance of one of the Assault Core's magical devices!"

As he spoke, he stood up directly and began to pace around.

"Friend, I need your help. Can you transmit his voice in real-time?"

Wén Bù Fǎ turned his head directly and said, "Are you not tired of taking advantage of others? If I do what he does, those magical devices will make me overexert myself, and if you want to hear his voice, everyone in this 'Forgotten Land' will hear it."

"What if he reveals the secrets of the Nine Swords?" Wén Bù Fǎ suddenly drew his sword and slashed it out!

Popping slash!
Jade-cut slash!
Time-stopping slash!

In the final round, he displayed two sets of consecutive attacks, looking effortlessly sharp, with room to continue expanding.

"No matter! I need to see his situation immediately!"

...

"I need to tell you how to strengthen the Assault Art from different dimensions, until ordinary people can deal hundreds or even thousands of damages."

Slowly, Zhao Xu's mind was organizing all the key abilities.

However, none of the people present noticed.

Their voices, even as gentle as a breath, were carried away by the wind and spread to the ears of everyone in the cave.
