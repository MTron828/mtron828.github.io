Chapter 432: The Curse of the Past

"'Outside?'"

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly, and then thought about what An Ti Noya had said earlier that this "Edzel Palace" would descend to the mortal world again. Didn't that mean...

"Yes, it is," An Ti Noya said, walking up to Zhao Xu and looking at him with a slight lift of her head. "At first, he had already set it up. This Edzel Palace will only last for two days when it first descends to the mortal world. When the time is up, the living people will be kicked out of this palace."

"It's not consistent with the six days, is it?" Zhao Xu asked, looking up and showing a hopeful expression at An Ti Noya.

As he spoke, he couldn't help but raise his head, looking at An Ti Noya with a questioning gaze. "Teacher, is it possible that the sacred breath is something you gave me?"

An Ti Noya almost knocked on Zhao Xu's head. "Zhong Xia, you're thinking too much. Your teacher may have wealth, but I don't have so many divine powers to give away, not even to you."

"'Divine powers'?"

Zhao Xu's voice made the one standing in the corner, Viela, turn her head.

This pious and unwavering saintly warrior girl felt a slight sense of tension in her heart when she heard the term "divine powers".

"No mistake, the Sacred Breath is indeed a high-level divine artifact, and its essence is a complete embodiment of divine powers, just like the will of the broken stone monument you saw in the floating city."

"It's even much better than that stone monument, completely lacking in independent consciousness. Once you get it, you can directly become a true deity, just like those lucky ones in history. Unlike the divine fragments in your hand, which are very inconvenient to use."

A complete divine power can ignite divine fire.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

In an instant, Zhao Xu's calm and unruffled mind began to stir. The legendary God of Massacre, Edmund, was famous throughout Arthur because he was the epitome of good fortune. From a lowly prisoner, he gained divine power and transformed into an immortal being, revered by countless people. It can be said that he was completely enviable. Even though Zhao Xu had been sailing smoothly ever since, his good fortune was far inferior to that of someone who had gained divine power. Obtaining divine power and becoming a god was the most direct way to ascend to heaven in Arthur's world. "But it's only possible to pass through one door each day, and two days are simply not enough," Zhao Xu said. This meant that Ernest had never intended for people to be able to ascend to heaven in just one step. "That's right, the two days are the time he left for the world's bait," Ernestina continued to explain. "Bait?" This was a term that would make someone with a strong sense of self-esteem feel uncomfortable, as if they were just waiting to be hooked like a fish. "You're the fish that have been lured in by the bait, and with your deaths, the Aelith Palace will inevitably attract the attention of powerful forces in the next world," Ernestina suddenly leaned in close to Zhao Xu, her face almost touching his, with only about 10-15 centimeters between them. After Zhao Xu had seen Ernestina's true appearance, she appeared before him without using her "darkness" to conceal her face. At this moment, Ernestina's naturally flawless beauty was fully revealed, causing even the ancient and refined Zhao Xu to feel his heart and mind slightly unsettled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When it first started, the two days of time allowed the Ai Duo Palace to slightly open its secrets to this world. It's to let the world know that there exists a 'key' like this. After it flew back to the sky, major powers in this region will start searching and investigating, combining with ancient secrets, and will eventually figure out the sacred breath, which is actually the manifestation of a god's power.

"So, when the Ai Duo Palace descends to the earth again, countless legendary strong individuals, major guilds, kingdoms, and even church organizations will all pour in their strength to intervene.

"The legendary battle!
A complete god's power cannot be hidden for too long, and it will eventually be known to all those who are qualified to know.

"No matter how powerful the forces may be, they will not mind having an additional divine-level ally.

"Especially during the short period when one has just obtained godly power, before the power has reached its limits, those who are almost invincible will be considered the strongest.

"Only a few legendary mages can barely restrain them.

"'Teacher, Ernest once placed a godly power here, which is like surrendering, isn't it a bit of a joke?' Zhao Xu finally couldn't help but joke.

"'Please maintain the proper respect for our leader,' Vivian suddenly said with a serious tone, for the first time looking at Zhao Xu with a serious expression.

"Zhao Xu just smiled and didn't explain or argue.

"Because Anzhiya had already started explaining to him, 'When he plays chess, he loves to do this, after determining he has an advantage, he likes to place a pawn on the board, which becomes the last move to stir up the scene.'

"'He hates a world that never changes.'"

Note: Ai Duo Palace is a term that refers to a powerful and mysterious place in the story. The text describes the events and conversations between the characters, including Zhao Xu, Vivian, and Anzhiya.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xu had almost definitely figured out that Ernest, the old man, was from the chaotic faction, Vivian suddenly interrupted with a question: "What kind of opportunity will the next landing bring?"

After rebuking Zhao Xu's disrespect towards Ernest, Vivian felt a sense of unease and asked the question, which was partly to make up for her earlier behavior. She knew that Zhao Xu had an extraordinary interest in the sacred rituals.

As she asked the question, Vivian's hands, which were gripping the hilt of her sword, were trembling slightly and were difficult to pry open.

"I don't know, it could be two years, or five years, or ten years. Ernest has set up a way to disturb the descent of the Aether Palace, but he entrusted May to handle it, so I'm not clear about the details."

"Can't you grasp the time?"

Thinking about this legendary battle, Zhao Xu felt a headache and was envious of the legendary powers, but he had not reached that level.

This time, if it weren't for Anniya's help, he wouldn't have been able to handle the explosion at the center of the destruction. Not to mention the four elemental lords, who could only be dealt with by Lakshmi's shape-shifting.

However, after Anniya appeared, Lakshmi remained silent, as if she was being pressured by Anniya's aura and would not speak unless absolutely necessary.

"It's likely to be ten years," Anniya confirmed.

"No, ten years, that's my estimate since I entered," Anniya said.

"It's true, within ten years, if you can become a legendary strong one, even if you only reach the ninth circle, you will have the qualification to participate in this challenge, which will gather almost all the legendary strong ones who are dedicated to becoming gods from across the continent."
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time point, it seemed to be very close to the time node when he crossed the previous era. If he didn't become a legend within the next ten years, he would automatically lose the qualification to obtain this divine power.

"You have advanced two barriers ahead of time, which will be your greatest advantage in the future. This means you are stronger than other legends and can challenge the 'Road to the Heavenly Realm' two days earlier."

"It's hard to grasp when the Eternal Palace will descend again," he said.

According to Anniya's words, this time, the mysterious forces would not understand the details and there would be obstacles in the reverse demon realm, so not many strong individuals would enter.

However, after investigating the traces left behind and knowing that there are divine powers inside, those forces, even if they couldn't return to the Eternal Palace in the Heavenly Realm, would definitely make corresponding arrangements.

At that time, once the palace descended, Zhao Xu would probably be able to see all the legendary strong individuals gathered at the Northern Alliance at once.

If these legendary strong individuals worked together, they could easily overwhelm the entire alliance.

However, if the arrangements were disturbed before they were set in motion, and Zhao Xu didn't have the nine rings, it would be too late.

"Anniya, you just explained the way to descend twice. May I ask, Miss May, if she understands?" Vivi asked, bowing her head slightly to Anniya.

Zhao Xu's attention was immediately drawn back.

"No mistake, you can understand it that way."

"As for what form it takes, you'll have to ask May yourself. I asked her, but she always keeps it a secret and won't tell me."

"Why?" Zhao Xu was surprised. As Anniya was the successor of Ernest, and May was his first disciple, how could they have such a close relationship?
Here is the translation of the text:

"That naive child thinks this is a secret between her and her master, so she naturally can't share it with me," Anzhiya said with a light hum.

"... ..."

Zhao Xu and Weian were equally speechless.

Even in the face of Anzhiya's ridicule, Weian didn't dare to speak up in opposition.

Zhao Xu was a bit troubled.

So, he thought, it would be difficult to get a key point out of it.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's mind flashed with an idea.

He remembered that when he was on Earth, May had taken him by the arm and whispered something in his ear, intentionally making sure Anzhiya couldn't hear it.

That incantation, which he had discovered was similar to the mysterious cryptogram on the treasure box, was something May had said to him: "Remember this incantation, I can only tell you this incantation on Earth."

Zhao Xu suddenly felt his palms grow stiff and his throat dry, as if he wanted to cough, but he tightly suppressed the urge.

He was afraid that he might accidentally recite that incantation out loud.

No wonder it could only be told on Earth.

Because, if that incantation was spoken by Arthur, the Aizhi Palace would descend upon the world.

At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

The key to the second descent of the Aizhi Palace, which he had held in his hand from the very beginning, was finally in his grasp!

"Teacher," Zhao Xu suddenly raised his hand.

Anzhiya's bright and shining eyes couldn't help but look at him, "Do you have an idea?"

"Yes, Teacher," Zhao Xu said lightly. "Those five bronze treasure boxes are your dowry, aren't I supposed to return them to you now?"

"Get out."
