Chapter 478 In the Name of Death
Upon hearing the other party's words, Zhao Xu couldn't help but silently remove the restrictions of "silencing technique."
At this time, Kuroze struggled a bit and found that his limbs were completely paralyzed and he was unable to move at all.
He hurriedly said in an urgent tone, "I have been managing for decades, and I have no descendants. I have secretly stored the wealth accumulated over many years in a cave outside the city of Oru."
As if afraid that Zhao Xu wouldn't believe him, he quickly added, "This wealth is actually the guild treasury of the entire underground forces of Oru City, accumulated over many years. Expenses such as funeral commissions and resettlement fees for my subordinates are all paid from this fund."
"This is the reason why I can make decisions in this position. The key to my stability in this position for so many years is this wealth. Even the leader of the alliance, Tang De, has coveted it and even promised me that if I hand over this wealth, he will allow me to start anew."
As he spoke, he looked at Zhao Xu hopefully.
At this moment, Flei also remained silent.
The fact that even the leader of the alliance, Tang De, coveted this immense wealth meant that it was a price that exceeded what she could afford.
Man dies for wealth, birds die for food.
Especially now that players have realized that accounts are terminated after five resurrection stones and cannot be inherited.
On the other hand, wealth can be transferred between accounts, so even after death and starting a new account, one can still inherit the "inheritance."
Zhao Xu glanced at the other person roughly and noticed that Kuroze was only wearing a fur coat on the outside, completely naked inside.
At first glance, it was clear that something had been done, and then a sudden situation arose, so there was only time to throw on a coat and escape. Otherwise, if the other party had been properly prepared, they might have found a magical item to teleport away at that moment.

In fact, no one had expected that someone would dare to launch a brutal and terrifying attack in the city of Oru, the capital of the Northern Alliance.

Zhao Xu looked at Kuroze and said, "You didn't bring any magic equipment in such a hurry, but you have quite a few protective spells on you, which means you had them prepared earlier. It seems you really have a huge fortune."

"And I quite like treasures," Zhao Xu nodded quietly.

At this point, Kuroze's originally stiff face relaxed slightly, as if sensing hope for his own survival. As for Flei, her expression dimmed, her mouth twitched slightly, and she seemed to have something to say but stopped herself.

"What a pity," Zhao Xu's face suddenly became serious. "My conscience is quite valuable."

"As for the secret of your treasure, I'll ask you from your corpse later, so you don't have to bother," Zhao Xu said, not even bothering to use the silence spell again. He didn't want to read the other's curses later.

He immediately took a piece of cloth from his backpack and stuffed it into Kuroze's mouth.

"Thank you," Flei said quietly, bowing her head.

Her long hair, which had been tied up, fell down again, covering her face.

"It's not necessary. If I didn't have the spell to question the dead, I might still be moved," Zhao Xu smiled, saying something that no one believed.

After all, as a mage, they could even extract information from the dead.

Kuroze immediately fell into a coma, his breath weak, as if he could die at any moment.
"Is it over?" Zhao Xu asked.
Fulei shook her head, "Not even half done."
Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu also shook his head.
Fulei had a wide circle of friends, and she was able to accumulate so many stories.
She immediately prayed for Kuroze, who was lying on the ground, "Heal moderate injuries."
The warm sunlight sprinkled onto Kuroze, who was covered in scars.
He immediately felt revived, his energy restored, and most of his wounds healed.
Once his vitality was restored to above the baseline, Kuroze regained consciousness and felt that his injuries had improved, thinking that reinforcements had finally come to rescue him.
But when he opened his eyes, he realized that it was still just the two of them.
In an instant, Kuroze's heart was filled with bitter curses, as if nothing could contain his anger.
"You demons!"
"How can you heal me and then torture me again?"
"You are truly unforgivable."
Even though Zhao Xu had acted to help Fulei, she was also a bit stunned by his treatment at this moment.
It seemed that she had underestimated the other party's ruthlessness.
The underground power's mastermind, Kuroze, did indeed use healing magic to fully recover, but the pain he felt was not reduced in the slightest.
"Hey hey," Zhao Xu hurriedly explained, "I don't have that kind of hobby, I just think... he needs to know how many things he has done wrong in this world."
"Can the evils of this world be settled with just one death?"
