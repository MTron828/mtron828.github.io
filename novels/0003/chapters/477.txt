Chapter 478: In the Name of Death

When he heard the other person say that, Zhao Xu couldn't help but quietly release the "Silence Technique" constraint.

At this moment, Kulose tried to struggle, but found that his limbs were completely numb and unable to move.

He quickly said in a hurried tone: "I have been managing for over 20 years, without leaving a successor. I have secretly stored the wealth I have accumulated over the years in a certain mountain cave outside Oulu City."

As he spoke, as if he was afraid Zhao Xu wouldn't believe him, he quickly added: "This wealth is actually the vault of the underground organization of Oulu City, which has been accumulating for many years. The funeral expenses and relocation fees paid by my subordinates are all deducted from this fund."

"This is the reason why I can confidently say that I have been sitting in this position for so many years. The key is that I have been relying on this wealth. Even Alliance Leader Tang De has coveted it, and has even promised to let me go free if I hand over this wealth."

As he spoke, he looked at Zhao Xu with a hopeful gaze.

As for Floria, she remained silent.

The wealth that even Alliance Leader Tang De coveted is a staggering sum that exceeds what she can afford to pay.

As for the players, they have realized that an account can only be revived five times, and cannot be inherited.

On the other hand, wealth can be transferred between accounts, and even after death, it can be inherited as "inheritance".

Zhao Xu roughly glanced at the other person and noticed that Kulose was only wearing a thin outer garment, completely naked underneath.

As soon as I saw it, I knew he had done something like that, and then unexpected events occurred, and he was able to escape by just throwing on a big coat.

If he had really prepared for it, he might have found a magical item to teleport away by now.

In reality, no one would have thought that someone would dare to launch a brutal massacre like a terrorist attack in the capital city of the Northern Alliance, let alone in this Aurora City.

Zhao Xun looked at Kuluoze and said, "You're rushing around without any magical equipment, and yet you have quite a few defensive spells on you. It seems you prepared this beforehand. It looks like you really do have a vast fortune."

"I also quite like treasure," Zhao Xun nodded silently.

At this moment, Kuluoze's originally rigid face relaxed slightly, as if he sensed the hope of extending his life.

As for Fulei, her face turned slightly pale, her lips twitching slightly, as if she wanted to say something but hesitated.

"Alas," she said.

Zhao Xun's expression suddenly turned serious. "My conscience is more precious than money."

"As for the secrets of your treasure trove, I'll just ask you after you're dead, so you don't have to trouble yourself."

Zhao Xun said this and didn't even bother to cast a silence spell, not wanting to wait for the other person's curses.

He took a piece of cloth from his backpack and handed it to Kuluoze.

"Thank you," Fulei said quietly, lowering her head.

Her long hair, which was previously tied up, fell down again, covering her face.

"It's not necessary. If I hadn't asked the dead to use the death spell, I might still be hesitant."

Zhao Xun smiled and said something no one would believe.

Who lets mages die and still manage to come up with such nonsense.

Then he gazed at the Kouloze before him, his tone cold as he recited the incantation. "Cancel magic."

Instantly, the key spell, a three-ring spell, enveloped Kouloze's entire body, clashing with the ongoing spells on his body.

However, the spells that Kouloze could frequently cast on himself, even constant ones, were not very powerful and were quickly dispelled by Zhao Xu.

"Let's get started," Zhao Xu said, slightly tilting his face.

Furē suddenly began to cry, her eyes streaming with tears. She knelt down, her whole body trembling, and stared at the helpless opponent before her.

"This is my mother, a girl from a neighboring country who was abducted by you," she said, her voice trembling.

She then stabbed his thigh with a small dagger.

"This is Marie, who had already agreed to marry her beloved man, but was captured by you and subjected to humiliation. She thought that her servitude would allow her beloved to survive, but in reality, the man had already been bitten to death by a wild animal by you."

Furē said, then stabbed his arm with the dagger.

"This is Anna's..."

She continued to stab him, saying the names of each person, seeking justice for them against Kouloze.

Kouloze's originally robust and coarse face had turned pale and white, his clothes stained with blood. Each wound was accompanied by the soul of a person who had died in a fiery inferno.

No one could withstand Furē's relentless stabbing, not even Kouloze, who had once been a powerful warrior, with a robust vitality. Even if he had a lot of blood, he would eventually exhaust his vitality after being stabbed so many times.

Koloz suddenly fainted and fell to the ground, his breathing as weak as a strand of silk, as if he was about to die at any moment.

"Is it over?" Zhao Xu asked.

Furley shook her head, saying, "Not even half has been done."

Zhao Xu also shook his head.

Furley had a wide circle of friends and was able to collect so many stories. He immediately began to pray over the unconscious Koloz, saying, "Healing of moderate injuries."

A warm and holy light spread over Koloz's wounds, which had been numerous and severe. Suddenly, Koloz was like he had been revived, his energy restored, and most of his wounds healed.

After his life force was restored to normal, Koloz's consciousness returned, and he felt that he had been rescued by his allies. However, when he opened his eyes, which had been hopeless just moments before, he was shocked to see that it was still just the two of them.

Koloz's inner curse of anger and hatred burst forth, as if the entire piece of fabric could not contain his fury.

"You demons!"

"What's the point of treating him and then punishing him again?"

"You are truly evil."

Although Zhao Xu had intended to help Furley, he was also surprised by her treatment. It seemed that he had underestimated her opponent.

The mastermind behind the underground organization, Koloz, had recovered to his full state through his treatment skills, but the pain he had endured was not diminished in the slightest.

"Hey, hey," Zhao Xu explained hastily, "I don't have such a hobby. I just think he should know how many mistakes he has made in this world."

"What kind of evil is this world, and can it be cleared up by just one death?"

As the process continued, although Kuroze's mouth was gagged with a cloth, he was still shouting and crying out in anguish, his mind constantly filled with regret and self-rebuke over his initial decision. Every time, Freya's new name would come with the pain of a knife cutting through the opponent's flesh.

He was forced to recall the fresh blood he had once stained his own hands with. It wasn't until Zhao Xu continued to apply several treatment spells that Kuroze's physical condition began to recover.

However, his mental state was already collapsing, tangled in a state of high tension. "Is it over?" Zhao Xu asked.

Freya was also panting, nodding her head slightly. Even though she had practiced this motion countless times since childhood, each name was like a catharsis for her.

At this moment, she had removed her mask, and her face was sweaty, with her hair stuck to her face. Her eyes had a hint of melancholy as she looked at Zhao Xu.

"You're not one to give up?" Zhao Xu teased, "Have you given up now?"

"No," Freya shook her head.

At this moment, they were in this cramped, enclosed space, with the entrance to the tunnel already sealed off. They could only rely on the small ventilation grille on the wall to breathe. However, Freya felt a sense of unprecedented lightness.

"Originally, I felt that I was shouldering the hatred of countless innocent souls who had been buried in this sinful land. With each of the recent stabs, I felt like I was unloading a load of strength."

Zhao Xu also looked at his palm, sighing, "Hatred is indeed a powerful driving force, motivating us to move forward."

"That's why I ended his life,"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, I've announced it. There's no need to torment him anymore, just kill him with one stroke of your sword," Freya said.

"Alright,"

At this moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but remove the cloth from in front of Kurouze's mouth, but he was already out of breath and couldn't speak.

Freya silently stood up, spitting at Kurouze, and said, "Go be a good person in the next life."

"No, he probably won't have a next life," Zhao Xu said, while taking out the staff made entirely of finger bones from his bosom.

He just stretched out the staff, pressing it against Kurouze's forehead.

"I take your soul in the name of death,"

"Soul binding technique."
