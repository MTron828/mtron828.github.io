Chapter 476, Third Prophecy
Zhao Xu stared at his own "Divine Fragment Unlock" prompt, frozen for about 10 seconds.

Immediately after, he felt a strong directional guidance from Zheng Xin An, as if a brilliant light had pierced through the darkness, effortlessly drawing his attention back.

As he saw the opponent's radiant light, he quickly scattered a portion of his energy towards it.

However, he didn't know that on the other side of Zheng Xin An, he had encountered an extraordinary and magnificent fate.

"Luckily, it's here," Lark's somewhat weak voice echoed in Zhao Xu's mind.

At this moment, a mysterious echo suddenly emerged in Zhao Xu's mind.

"He goes against the flow of time."
"He holds the eternal holy artifact, spreading the brilliance of magic."
"He was born amidst chaos and disorder, bestowing the world with its first division."
The third sentence of the first prophecy of the seven major prophecies, without any warning, echoed in Zhao Xu's mind.

"It's as expected," Lark's voice was sweet and weak, as if moved to the truth of life.

Zhao Xu also reacted.

He could hear the prophecy because he had achieved it!

Going against the flow of time is because Zhao Xu had traveled back to Earth's university classroom four months ago from 10 years in the future, guided by Arthur.

Holding the eternal holy artifact is because he met Lark, and spreading the brilliance of magic is because he had always been doing so.

As for "born amidst chaos and disorder," it might refer to the moment he became "chaotic benevolent."

Zhao Xu, who had once chosen "absolute neutrality" to "take advantage of the situation."
Here is the translation of the text:

Adhering to the doctrine of the goddess, he turned towards being in harmony with the goddess, pursuing the concept of "neutral goodness". However, he again took up the sword of freedom and became a part of "chaotic goodness" due to his free-spirited nature.

He and the magical goddess Sylvia still had a significant faith gap, and he was not yet qualified as a pastor.

"What advice do you have, Lysandra?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this moment, the entire Blaze of the Red Lips was plunged into unprecedented chaos. The legendary magic puppets, with their incredible might, had become a killing machine before the strong even appeared. Anyone who was targeted by them would be instantly killed, with no chance of survival.

Especially the Secret Silver Magic Puppets, although their overall numbers were weaker than the Golden Magic Puppets, relied on their "agility" ability to strike twice in each round, cutting down two people, and outputting even more power.

They were like two absolute masters, unable to wipe out enemies like cannons, but each time they used "heavy blows" and "invincible defense", becoming the walking death gods on the battlefield.

All the reinforcements were slaughtered, and the emotions collapsed. Panic-stricken, they fled in disarray.

At this moment, Zhao Xu stood silently near a burning fire pit, expressionless and motionless. However, no one dared to approach him or lay a hand on him.

"Master, it seems we need to constantly fulfill the prophecy to continue exploring it," Lysandra said.

"If you follow the direction of the prophecy, you will find that the will of the entire world is aligned with you."

"The prophecy is, in fact, a forecast of the trajectory of the impending storm," Lysandra said again.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a sense of resonance.
Here is the translation of the text:

The lightning that connects heaven and earth is actually the discharge of electricity along the path of least resistance. If the weather does not change for a short time, the lightning situation at that time will be predetermined. Prophecy is also like this. It actually refers to the possibility of the smallest resistance in the process of world development.

Lark asked him to go with the flow. "But aren't we just going to verify the prophecy afterwards?" Zhao asked. "No, master, this is referring to the unknown part of the prophecy, but the known part of the prophecy, we can still make an effort."

Zhao's eyes flashed slightly. Lark was telling him to continue executing the previous three sentences.

As he thought about this, he couldn't help but feel a stirring in his heart. He went back in time, using the legendary magic of Anis, and saw the Morlin monument again. This time, he saw it, which laid a very solid foundation for his future progress.

But later, he would have to use Lark's magic again?

And then scatter the magical aura?

"It's correct, master," Lark said. "From now on, as long as you continue to scatter the aura of magic, you will be able to upgrade quickly."

"I sensed it beforehand, when the wizarding association is set up, you will automatically be promoted to level 8, which is the advantage of going with the flow."

Zhao nodded slightly, feeling a sense of contemplation.

Just like the lightning rod in the lightning area is erected to artificially reduce the resistance and increase the probability of lightning strikes. Through it, the lightning is attracted and other buildings are protected.

He became the "Magic Goddess" priest, part of spreading magic.
He became the "Final Scroll" "secret keeper", also part of it.
Here is the translation of the text:

He swore an oath to the "Source of Magic", and it was no different for a part of him.

All these actions brought him immense benefits.

This means that when the "Mage Association" of Starfall Town was established, he would inevitably stand out.

At this moment, Zhao Xu felt for the first time the sense of looking through the "board layout".

He knew the flow of the fish in the water and the trajectory of the flying bird.

"It's good," Zhao Xu lifted his head and looked at the sky, and suddenly a cold rain poured down from the sky, extinguishing some of the flames and seeping into his skin.

"This rain is the projection of my power," Lark said. "I can only use this most superficial way to infuse my power and destroy the scene. From now on, you don't have to worry about them detecting any clues."

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied. "But I still have to continue to fulfill my chaotic role."

"Capture that Kroze," Lark analyzed.

He had already seen Floria, wearing a tight-fitting dress, running towards him. In theory, she should not have appeared here to raise suspicion.

"Hurry, I've received a message, the high-level leaders of the alliance have issued a summons, and a high-level mage will arrive here soon," Floria's voice was filled with urgency.

Zhao Xu's brows also furrowed slightly, as the reaction speed of the high-level mages was beyond his expectations.

He decided to take action tonight, which was actually a time difference, otherwise he would go to the branch of the Mage Association the next day to pay his respects and then take action, by which time his suspicion would be difficult to eliminate.

"I have to find Kroze first," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's too late, we can attack him later, and today's destruction has definitely left him shaken to his bones. This achievement is far beyond what Flea had imagined."

Zhou Xu shook his head, "No, we won't kill him tonight. Maybe you'll never have the chance to kill him again."

"But we've missed our chance to find him," Flea said, her voice filled with despair.

She had just looked around, but no matter how she looked, she couldn't see the silhouette of her sworn enemy, who had caused her so much pain.

"Trust me, there's no one in this world who can't be dug up by a spellcaster."

Ordinary people may not have learned this kind of digging spell, and it's costly.

But he, Zhou Xu, was one of the most skilled in all the four circles of magic, with a vast range of spells at his disposal. Even if all the four circles of magic combined, they might not have as many spells as he did.

"I need your help," Zhou Xu said.

"Yes?"

"Do you have anything from Kuroze, like information, clothes, or hair?"

Flea couldn't help but laugh bitterly. She had never thought that the special item she had prepared for later would have such a use.

"That lock of Kuroze's hair was obtained by bribing an internal servant, and I managed to get it. I was originally planning to use it to complement the curse spell."

"Just right,"

Hair, a bodily organ, is a powerful tool. In fact, it's a requirement for casting location spells, but most of the time, Zhou Xu had only seen the surface of things, and this behind-the-scenes black hand was unfamiliar to him.

But as a spellcaster, he naturally had a way to make the unfamiliar familiar.

"Perceive!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Instantly, Zhao Xu used his multi-talented spellcasting to directly compress the spellcasting time, turning this three-hour spell that consumed a lot of time into a flash spell that was cast out immediately.

This spell was originally a four-ring spell of a wizard and a five-ring spell of a pastor, and he should not be able to cast it now. However, it was a three-ring spell of a poet, so Zhao Xu could cast it earlier.

At this moment, he did not see anyone around him, but his body was slightly trembling and his eyes were fixed on the ceiling with a sense of fear.

This spell allowed Zhao Xu to see everything within a radius of 3.5 meters around the target.

"It's pretty fast to hide, but I guess my luck has come to an end this time. Can you still escape so quickly?" Zhao Xu lifted his head and took out a small piece of fur from a hunting dog, gently rubbing it between his fingers.

Slowly, accompanied by a mysterious incantation, Zhao Xu began to pace back and forth in the same spot, as if he was feeling the electromagnetic waves from around him.

This four-ring spell, biological location spell, was above the two-ring item location spell and was a prophecy spell that was worthy of being called the "Artemis-level search radar".

However, casting this spell required a "familiar" level of effect. At this moment, Zhao Xu was relying on "knowledge" to satisfy the "familiar" level, allowing him to cast the "biological location spell" smoothly.

Instantly, Zhao Xu's mind cleared, and he turned his gaze towards a burning building below.

In that place, there was an underground tunnel.

"Just here?" Floria followed Zhao Xu's gaze downwards, but it was too late to put out the fire and find the underground tunnel now.
Here is the translation:

"Let's go!" Zhao Xu pulled Fu Lei's hand at this moment.
"Where to? It's not too late, is it?"
"No, the mage wants to go to a place, and it's not necessary to see it with one's own eyes."
"Portkey."
