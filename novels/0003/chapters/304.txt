Chapter 305: Preserving the Corpse

After everyone emerged from the underground stone room, they all looked quite different. The notebook that was the target of the team's objective was securely stored in a lead box with a rope wrapped around it. The lead box was used to shield against detection of magical effects. After the notebook was placed inside, it became quiet and no longer flew towards Zhao Xu's side automatically.

Zhao Xu suspected that it was some kind of "aggregation" property. He had previously placed two notebooks side by side without any reaction. During his time in the underground temple, he had Andy's notebook in his backpack and the notebook of the wraith in his hand. Throughout the entire process, there was no unusual phenomenon.

It wasn't until he stuck the two notebooks together that they fused. Now, just after he took it out, the notebook seemed to be flying towards him again. Therefore, he suspected that it was because his own notebook had become "2/7" and had an automatic attraction to the other "1/7".

As for what happened in the stone room below, it was impossible to hide. With the whispers of the players and the low tones of the Watcher's Guild members, they quickly became clear about what had just happened. It also caused Zhao Xu to experience another round of surprise and admiration.

"You mean it's possible that everything was arranged by a behind-the-scenes mastermind?"

"You're thinking too much."

"There's no way that an artifact would be that smart."

"Or maybe we're actually participating in some kind of epic storyline in Arthur's history?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"I guess there's a small chance it will still work, and who knows, maybe it will just start up on its own when we get to the wizard tower."

As he listened to these over-the-top speculations, Zhao Xu was forced to control the shadowy steed under his feet, further distancing himself from the group to avoid being infected.

Just now, they had opened the notebook and looked at the detailed address of the wizard tower recorded inside, while the notebook was automatically attached to the stone room. The details of the tower's interior would be analyzed later that night.

Zhao Xu also knew that the wizard tower was submerged in the "Moon Lake" about a day's distance from this marshy area.

However, the Moon Lake was already near the "Evening Peak Valley", where various powerful monsters were stationed, which was another risk of this journey.

After leaving the marsh, Zhao Xu deliberately kept a distance from the notebook to prevent it from being noticed by possible enemies who might be observing them in secret.

He was afraid that if he got too close, even the lead box wouldn't be able to shield the connection between the two notebooks.

Watching the notebook flying around outside might attract the attention of enemies who were secretly observing them, and they might try to intercept them directly.

So, everyone agreed to only open the lead box and read the notebook's contents in a closed room.

In reality, Zhao Xu was also helpless, as he was the only one who couldn't hold the lead box.

According to the agreement, the wizard tower would ultimately belong to him, and as long as he held the notebook, he could modify the records in the notebook about traps and hidden treasures, making it possible to hide part of the treasure.

More importantly, he was afraid that before entering the wizard tower, the two notebooks would start to merge and cause unpredictable phenomena.
Here is the translation of the text:

After a while, Frost Sword, accompanied by some high-ranking officials of the union, walked up to Zhao Xu. "Mr. Furious Wind, please wait a moment," Frost Sword said, his voice calm and steady.

Zhao Xu turned around, looking puzzled. "Yes?" he asked.

"Frost Sword said, "After our discussion, we think it's better for you to keep the 'lead box' with the notebook. It's safer that way."

Zhao Xu hesitated for a moment. He noticed that Frost Sword's face was sincere, and after their time together, he didn't seem like the kind of person who would retreat and attack.

"So, you're giving it to me sincerely?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No, I'll wait until you've collected all the treasures from the Mage Tower and then I'll give it back to you," Zhao Xu politely declined.

He really wanted to use his identity as a high-level investigator to obtain the notebook in the underground room.

Given that Andy's family, also known as the Yasa family, was involved in the case of demonic blood, Zhao Xu used his investigator skills to the fullest extent, and he was acting within the law.

"Frost Sword's expression turned serious. "Firstly, we believe in your integrity, Mr. Furious Wind. Secondly, this time we may be targeted by someone."

"So, if a battle breaks out, it's possible that someone will be taken away or the lead box will be stolen, and the greatest possibility is death. If I die, I won't be able to determine the final outcome of the winner, so I'll immediately choose to revive and have the 'lead box' returned to Mistral."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If you hold the 'Crazy Wind' item, you can survive with a high survival rate and bring your notebook with you smoothly. Even if you're not strong enough to win, you can choose to transfer the items to my teammates and have them resurrect and send the items back. It seems that Frost Sword intentionally came up with a convincing reason to persuade Zhao Xu to hold this lead box.

As the holder of the item, even if Frost Sword dies, even if Zhao Xu and his team win, they will still have to retreat. Zhao Xu frowned slightly after hearing this, as in intense battles, there's usually no time to think too much, unless Zhao Xu agrees to tell the opponent that he has a 'time-reversal amulet' to avoid this situation.

However, Zhao Xu already has another notebook in his backpack, and he doesn't want to create unnecessary trouble. He plans to directly combine the two notebooks in his backpack, and then give the original notebook back to Frost Sword.

Especially since the notebook is related to the El'gor bloodline, Zhao Xu is worried about the Mage Tower's similar requirements. If the notebook is combined, he'll have to find another token. Moreover, the underground chamber's isolation will prevent enemies from forcibly opening the Mage Tower.

The notebook only vaguely mentions this aspect.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment before reassuring, 'Don't worry, if I die, I'll use the preservation spell to delay your resurrection time. I'll make sure the notebook won't go back to Mistral.'

When people die, their bodies will naturally decompose, and all their equipment will be taken by enemies. As a player, if you die, you'll enter a state of unconsciousness for a certain period, during which your body will still be tangible and can be looted. Once you regain consciousness in the Creative Sanctuary, you can continue waiting for your body to be resurrected, which may take several days.

However, players usually choose to resurrect with the 'resurrection stone'."
Here is the translation of the text:

If the player chooses to use this method, their body will immediately transform into an invulnerable spectral form that lasts for half an hour before disappearing. During this time, it is also the waiting period for the "resurrection" spell to take effect.

After half an hour has passed and the spectral form disappears, the player will be revived and reappear near the temple. Therefore, Arthur will not simultaneously revive two player bodies.

In the past, Zhao Xu had once used the "Miracle" spell to bring back to life the classmates who had been killed by the giant giant, and all the people who had fallen had become spectral forms, waiting to be revived. Later, they were brought back to life by Zhao Xu, and their spectral forms transformed into real bodies, and their souls returned to their bodies.

The "Mortification" spell, a level 2 holy spell, can extend the duration of a corpse's preservation by several days, thereby delaying the revival time limit for the deceased.

In the later stages, when players have a certain amount of money or after using the revival stone, they will often cast the "Mortification" spell and return to the city temple to seek the revival spell.

However, after the player dies and the "Mortification" spell is used, their body will become a real body and not a spectral form, allowing it to be looted. It won't disappear until half an hour has passed and the player is revived.

Half an hour is long enough to do anything.

Especially after a few players have been killed and their equipment has been looted, and the opponent is revived and becomes destitute, the players become even more cautious of this spell.

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, Shang Jian believed that the other person was just afraid of being suspected and hastily consoled Zhao Xu again, insisting on sending the lead box over.

However, Zhao Xu had a temporary reason for not being able to take it and had to refuse again.

At the time, the members of the Watchers' Guild looked at the two people pushing back and forth, all feeling puzzled.
Here is the translation of the given text:

"'Will the guildmaster not be the one who sent us a lead box in the past? Now, that thing is equivalent to half a wizard tower, isn't it? Looking at it, I thought it might be a bomb at first glance.'

'Ah, this wind wizard is really reliable, truly trustworthy.'

'Not wrong, it seems our luck is really good, we've met a reliable wizard like this.'

Just as they were dismissing this, the "prisoner demon" that could be considered the strongest among all the people present, suddenly stopped in its tracks, gazing at something in the forest. This sudden movement also made everyone focus their attention and look over.

In the area in front of the reeds, where the line of sight was difficult to penetrate, faint sounds of clashing weapons could be vaguely heard."
