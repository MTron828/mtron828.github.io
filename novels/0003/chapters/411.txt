Chapter 412: The Start

"Have you heard? It turns out that Dong Cheng Yin is a student from our school!"

"What? Who is this big shot who has been hiding and waiting for so long?"

"I don't know, but I can only say one thing - oh my god."

"I used to admire the first player, 'Star Shadow', who played a key role in the 'Star Lake Battle'. Now, I'm announcing that I'm defecting to Dong Cheng Yin's camp."

Since university is on winter break, students can only discuss games in the group chat.

Suddenly, all topics were overshadowed by these two.

Especially, Dong Cheng Yin's account, which is likely to belong to a university student, sparked heated discussions, with everyone focusing on the famous female player from the school.

However, it's widely recognized that solo players in a difficult game like Arthur can't possibly level up independently in the wild.

No one can grow independently outside of the game's social network.

All suspicious players will soon be cleared.

As soon as a speculation post is published, the suspected player's companion will deny it within 30 minutes, pointing out the inconsistencies.

The forum became chaotic.

As for the wealthier guild studios and MCN companies, they will also pay attention to this.

As a game that has been online for four months, Arthur's exchange rate for in-game currency to Renminbi in the underground market has been very strong.

Apart from bringing sweet profits to the entire gaming industry chain, some companies that are not involved in the game are also seeking to join in.

Currently, the mysterious account "East City" has become a focal point of attention for related companies due to its reputation, and the signing fee for sending a private message to this account has been continuously increasing.

...On the devastated wasteland where a massive explosion had reduced everything to ruins, a group of over ten refugees, with sorrowful and pained faces, struggled to move their legs. Most of them were dressed in tattered clothes, and many had skin blisters from burns. Some even had open wounds that were still bleeding.

Most people had no way to bind clean bandages and could only tear off their own clothes to makeshift bandages. They followed the elderly villager in front, who had a limp, as they retreated from the direction of the massive explosion. Their eyes were dull and could not see a bright future.

The massive explosion had filled the sky with thick fog, and the ground was filled with the pungent smell of burnt remains. Even ordinary people could not help but cough when they walked a short distance. At this time, a team of 30-40 players, fully equipped, was heading towards the epicenter of the explosion.

They happened to meet these refugees, who were quickly drawn to the team's attention. The refugees were in a desperate state, and it was clear why.

"For us, the explosion was a blessing, while for these refugees, it was a disaster that destroyed their homes," said the warrior player carrying a shield as he walked at the front.

The team leader, who had just seen the refugees' pitiful state and the gaze of his team members who were extremely skilled in healing, could only sigh and wave his hand to stop the team, instructing the team members with medical skills to provide simple first aid to the refugees.

"It's strange. Last time, I saw a group of merchants being chased, and I didn't care about my mission. Why am I suddenly feeling compassionate now?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"They are a well-known player guild team in the vicinity, and this time, they quickly organized the team on this clear morning before the upcoming holiday. They came to this explosive center to start a new adventure.

"'You don't know, the team leader just watched those people get killed and didn't lift a finger,' his girlfriend Xiaoya said, 'and she lost her priest abilities on the spot because she was too afraid to disobey.'

"'I'm going? I don't know, Xiaoya said she specialized in choosing the wrong role, and it turned out to be this inside story,' a player muttered to himself.

"'Just you naive, the market price of a priest role is very high, and those divine abilities are like living gold,' a man sneered.

"He continued to say, 'Do you really think East City's poster is just nonsense?'

"'Internal nature determines the initial faction, and subsequent behavior is biased. Unless you can play that role for a lifetime, otherwise, simply to get power and pretend to be in a faction will ultimately reveal your true intentions.'

"'But these people also look pretty pitiful. You say if we were the original inhabitants of this world, we would be in a very helpless situation.'

"'Oh, come on, what you see now is just a close call, and they just happened to dodge the explosion and hide in the pit to avoid the shockwave.'

"'And don't think the team leader is really that kind-hearted. He's just trying to chat with the village chief to see if he encountered any teams during his escape, and what the scene was like during the explosion.'

"However, just as they were chatting and laughing, a team of wyverns suddenly ran towards them from a distance."

"Arthur is not just serving humans, and many species think they are the main characters of this continent."
Here is the translation:

The majority of these lizardmen have an IQ of over 8 and are able to communicate freely. The leader, wearing armor, suddenly rushed over and grabbed the village elder, who was answering questions, and shouted loudly, "What's going on?"

The players beside him seemed like nothing.

The leader of the lizardmen, emitting a unique stench characteristic of his species, made the surrounding villagers and players feel nauseous.

"What do you mean?" said the team leader of the players, impatiently.

The lizardman leader, using a rudimentary language, said, "I'm not interested in arguing with you, I just want to ask some questions."

As he spoke, he tightened his grip on the elder's neck and continued to pressure him, but the elder's complexion had turned red due to lack of breath.

"Idiot!" the team leader, who was the highest-level player in the nearby region and a first-string warrior, swung his sword at the chaotic and evil lizardman.

Instantly, numerous weapons were drawn, and blood splattered everywhere.

This leader, whose IQ was higher than that of ordinary lizardmen, knew that he was facing a group of players who were unwilling to sacrifice their strength and resources for the sake of advancing to the front line.

He never thought that asking questions would lead to a fight.

Or, he couldn't understand the players' decision-making.

Sometimes, players would change sides for benefits, abandoning their original goals.

Sometimes, they would take a deep breath and make a desperate move, sacrificing everything.

Scenarios like these are constantly unfolding in this 50-kilometer radius of the blast zone.

Explorers come to fight, those affected by the disaster flee to escape, and each one rushes off in a hurry...
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu, who was at the epicenter of the explosion in the Ai Duo Palace, knocked over the clay golem with his two sticks and then knelt down on the ground, constantly probing the clay golem's chest.

"Will you recover?" Vivia asked with some confusion, unable to suppress a cry.

Zhao Xu only then discovered that Vivia had removed her helmet and had a small amount of blood on her mouth. At this time, he gently wiped it away, and her face was pale and beautiful.

"I'm sorry." Zhao Xu hastily stood up and quickly released a level 2 "Medium Injury Treatment" spell.

After obtaining the magical pearl, he would activate the pearl every day before preparing his buffs, increasing his initial spellcasting level and meeting the subsequent conditions.

Ten minutes later, the stacked spellcasting level did not disappear.

Therefore, he directly reached a spellcasting level of 14 (6 profession + 5 physical sacrifice spell + 1 Ayn stone + 1 headband + 1 tattoo).

Even with another magical pearl, he could activate it at any time to reach a spellcasting level of 18.

So, for the "Medium Injury Treatment" spell, he added 10 points of level treatment to the original 2-16 range.

This one spell released 20 points of treatment, instantly restoring Vivia's injuries to almost nothing.

The most powerful aspect of the healing spell is that when the treatment energy is injected into the body, the life value is restored to full.

Even if the injured person had fallen into a coma, they would instantly come back to life.

Unless afflicted with a negative status, there would be no lingering internal injuries.

[Adventurer Zhong Xia, your "Medium Injury Treatment" spell, through spellcasting level checks, has overcome the 26-level difficulty of the clay golem's injury, and the healing spell works normally.]

"How are you?" Vivia noticed that Zhao Xu's expression had become slightly stagnant.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There's nothing," Zhao Xu said with a comforting smile. "Come and help us dismantle this clay golem. 'Injury' is a special attack ability of the clay golem, which can block the healing ability of the injured person."

The cleric wants to cast a healing spell, but it needs to go through a 26-level spellcaster proficiency test. Even if Zhao Xu, a 14-level spellcaster, tries, there's more than a 50% chance that the healing spell will fail.

Now, players without stacking spellcaster levels cannot even try to cast a healing spell under the clay golem's attack.

As Zhao Xu thought about this, his gaze drifted to the dark and distant place in the direction of the stone bridge.

He even suspected that the clay golem that broke through Vi Vi's defense with the second strike might not have a true attack ability of only 14 levels.

If that's the case, it means that these golems might be enhanced.

This is just the appetizer.

It's scary to think that players might all surrender and give up exploring without even trying.

"I have some doubts about these clay golems, so let me check," Zhao Xu said.

As he spoke, he began to dismantle the severely broken clay golem body.

To create a golem, you need the "Creation of Living Beings" creative specialty, and the main production process is to mix a block of almost a ton of clay with 1500 gold coins' rare oil and powder, and then shape it through skills such as pottery-making and sculpture.

During the production process, you also need to master spells such as "Animation of Living Objects" (six rings), "Divine Magic" (five rings), and "Resurrection" (seven rings), and combine them with corresponding talismans to activate them.

Strictly speaking, clay golems are still the easiest to create.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu was observing the mysterious magical symbols inscribed on the earthy soil within the golem's body, struggling to decipher them.

Slowly, his expression turned serious.

He noticed that the thought process behind these golem's inscriptions was similar to the encrypted symbols on the few bronze boxes he had found in the underground lair.

Thinking back to the powerful magical tome within the bronze box, which was made by Ernest, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

Could it be that this Eldritch Palace was also connected to Ernest?

The fact that he had already been exhausted by the previous demonic half-face was unbearable to him.

He couldn't bear to think about the higher-level schemes set by the masters.

Zhao Xu's doubts grew stronger, and he directly pulled out the bronze box from his backpack and compared it to the symbols on the crumbling soil.

Suddenly, the symbols on the golem's body, which had lost their power and were gradually fading away, burst forth with a resplendent radiance, directly pouring into the second bronze box.

The originally blank space within the bronze box extended more patterns, as if it had been filled.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to pick up the other fragments to compare them, a sudden voice appeared in his mind.

"Isn't this how you play?"

"Who could have imagined that it would be the Twilight Forest?"

A sturdy barbarian, wielding a massive axe, looked at the desolate landscape with a sense of regret.

He had done a task here before, when the forest was still lush and green, with the nearby city's wood industry thriving.

But now, everything had changed overnight, transforming into nothingness.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's go, we can't afford to waste any more time, or we might miss the first wave. Starfall Town gained a secret silver vein due to a meteorite and if we find some metallic crystals at the meteorite's impact site, we'll be rich overnight." A wandering adventurer smiled mischievously.

"If I can find them, I'll go back and buy a plot of land and live a life of ease as a wealthy gentleman," a wild man echoed.

Just as they were about to continue moving forward, they suddenly heard a majestic, heavenly-like whisper.

At this moment, everyone within a 50-kilometer radius of the blast center heard this statement.

"'Remnant Castle of Aido remains closing countdown: 6 hours."
"'Higher-grade divine artifact - Sacred Breath activation countdown: 6 hours."
"'Current number of entrants: 2."
"'Personnel 1: Summer the Mage (Earth)."
"'Personnel 2: Saint Warrior Vivian (Deep Abyss)."
