Chapter 379: Breaking the Curse

The barbarian, clad in a relatively inexpensive medium-sized armor, reacted quickly when he heard Viola's question. He smiled and said, "I'm just a medicine peddler. It's because this family sells medicine at a low price to the poor, breaking the monopoly on medicine prices, that they've incurred jealousy."

"That's fine, let's travel together then, but we won't pay a fee. We'll provide whatever help we can, but if things go wrong, we'll have to rely on our own efforts to escape," Zhao Xu said, his tone bleak.

The barbarian raised an eyebrow and said with a bitter smile, "Yes, we'll have to flee for our lives."

Once the team is attacked, it will be a chaotic scene. At that time, the group of fugitives who have been following us will probably become our enemies, directly attacking us.

Even if we're attacked, it's possible that hidden enemies will swarm out. However, the Ai Lasi family doesn't have the courage to leave the main team and venture out on their own. If they do, they'll be completely wiped out.

Many people in the team have realized the trick.

When the monsters attack, they can escape quickly, leaving the main team behind and running faster than others.

After that, Zhao Xu and Viola also saw the leader of the Ai Lasi family, Mr. Camon, riding a small horse at the front of the team, who nodded to greet them.

During this time, Mr. Camon's twin daughters, around seven or eight years old, with their hair tied up in two small braids, secretly lifted the curtain of the horse-drawn carriage to gaze at them with curiosity.

At the same time, the family butler also took out some dry rations from the backpack and handed them to Zhao Xu and Wei Wei'an. However, Zhao Xu, being a player, didn't need to eat or drink, and he simply put the rations away in his backpack. Wei Wei'an said with a bad tone that she relied on the energy of the victim's life to eat. Normally, she would silently absorb energy to recover in the deep abyss, so she also didn't mind taking it back. The butler thought that the two of them were initially hesitant to eat foreign food, so he didn't suspect anything. Zhao Xu and Wei Wei'an then rode side by side in the middle of several carriages, looking at each other's faces. At this time, Wei Wei'an also casually removed her own helmet, as the helmet was not worn by the devil herself, who wore armor. After removing the helmet, her original appearance was extremely pure, and she emitted a deep and mysterious aura. Suddenly, the entire team's attention was drawn to this place. Even without realizing it, everyone was nudged by their companions to look towards Zhao Xu. Slowly, the gaze of those who looked at Zhao Xu also contained a hint of jealousy. She was jealous that the beauty was in his arms. The red-colored calamity had a mysterious connection from the beginning. Those who were mesmerized by her beauty were all awakened by someone else's reminder, barely recovering from their daze. This is the power of Wei Wei'an's 26-point magical body. If she weren't wearing this armor, and instead wore a tight-fitting dress that fitted her body, she would probably bewitch everyone, making them lose their minds.
Here is the translation of the text:

Vivian, your charm is really high, and you've got the kids under your spell. Zhao Xu joked, and the kids in front of him, who weren't qualified to ride the horse, were all staring at Vivian with their eyes glued to hers.

The natural beauty of the woman made everyone involuntarily take a second look. Vivian, however, blushed and gave Zhao Xu a stern look, but didn't dare to speak up.

At this moment, a few players dressed in makeshift armor walked over to Cao Meng, who was leading the group. Zhao Xu slightly controlled the horse's movement, moving closer to the group.

As someone with the same 19th-level listening skill as Vivian, she didn't need to exert much effort to translate for Zhao Xu in real-time. At this moment, she lightly controlled the horse's movement, slightly leaning over Zhao Xu and trying to position herself in front of him.

In reality, Vivian had initially suggested that they ride together, but Zhao Xu had refused her offer.

"Cao Meng, sir, you've paid a large sum of money to hire us to escort you. If anything unexpected happens, we'll naturally come to your aid," Cao Meng said with a forced smile.

Vivian's eyes rolled in frustration as Cao Meng continued to speak. "Don't worry, my subordinates will protect us."

The players suddenly burst into battle, and things became chaotic.

The opponent's protection, which didn't involve personal protection, was ultimately just a empty promise.

One of the players, who had initially thought it would be easy, felt a sense of discontent. "On Earth, we say that many roads mean many brothers. Don't cut off the road, or you'll end up with no brothers," he thought to himself.

However, Cao Meng's tone was already set, and he didn't bother to pay attention to the players' intentions.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Vivia was intently gazing at Zhao Xu, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. She quietly utilized her psychic abilities, which could take effect within a 30-meter range, to communicate with Zhao Xu.

"What do you mean, Councilor," she said, "is this the kind of behavior we've come to expect from our players?"

It was clear that Vivia had also grasped the opponent's intention to bluff.

Zhao Xu scowled and replied, "Just an example, just an example."

At this point, the three players who had come to demand money from Cammon refused to accept his refusal and became enraged. They blew a whistle and suddenly, more than ten players rushed over.

Without the constraint of the city guards, some of these players quickly realized that during their journey to the North Alliance, they were in a lawless region.

The merchants who had been swindled wanted to take revenge, but there was no one to complain to.

At this time, the initial leader of the group, a lanky figure, smiled mischievously at Cammon and said, "Sir, a sword has no eyes. When the real battle breaks out, we may suffer some losses, but the key is what happens to your people behind you."

As he spoke, he scanned the personnel of the merchant's team, many of whom were wearing armor and even carrying weapons.

However, most of the others were ordinary civilians who could only follow on foot.

At this time, the people who were fleeing also noticed the strange scene unfolding before them, but no one dared to intervene, as everyone was preoccupied with their own affairs.

No one dared to make a bet, and the scene was dominated by the dozen or so players present.

Cammon was gritting his teeth at this point.

His original convictions were beginning to waver.

Having stubbornly refused to compromise and had encountered countless walls in Luca City, he decided to make a hasty retreat this time, influenced by the shadow of war.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as he didn't expect, he suddenly received a demand for safe withdrawal from the player. Initially, he deliberately chose a bodyguard team to avoid such extortionate behavior, but it seemed that they were only pretending to be working. Standing on the side, waiting for his order to decide whether to fight or retreat.

Just then, the threatening wanderer raised his voice again. Zhao Xu looked at the scene with a sense of boredom and directly ordered, "Vivian, teach them a lesson."

Feeling annoyed, Vivian laughed out loud when she heard Zhao Xu's words. She directly kicked her horse and controlled the warhorse in front of her, while her hand-held activation mirror directly flew up and rotated around her in front.

At this moment, Vivian gripped her "Holy Avenger" with her hand, and her heart became as calm as a peaceful lake. She directly charged towards the leader of the wandering group.

Suddenly, the cold iron longsword in her hand was drawn out, emitting a burst of cold light in high-speed movement.

Everyone in the scene was mesmerized by the mysterious and dazzling sword, as if it was tightly grasping them.

The swift sword shattered the air, accompanied by Vivian's own momentum, inducing a tidal wave of power.

One sword shattered the mountains, and no more than this.

At this moment, the wandering group's leader, who had been shaken by Vivian's words, hastily performed evasive actions, trying to dodge to another position and avoid entering the main force.

However, after hearing the opponent's words at close range, his face changed again.

"Break the demon's sword!"
Vivian's innate 7th-grade attack!
Saint Warrior's attack stacked with 3 grades!
Here is the translation of the text:

"Divine Avenger 5th-grade attack!
Praise 3rd-grade attack!
Charge 2nd-grade attack!
Destroying Slash 8th-grade attack!
As these attacks overlap, this sword presents a mysterious aura of 28th-grade attack power, instantly surpassing everyone's understanding.
Even if Violet is swinging freely.
This swing, under the accumulation of powerful force, is as if a unicorn's horn, unstoppable and deadly!
Ordinary players' low defense makes Violet not need to consider her actual combat level, which is 1-20 grades above hers.
Her sword's lower limit has already surpassed everyone's defense.
This is what Arthur has accumulated, creating an insurmountable chasm in front of everyone.
In an instant, the sword pierces through.
Accompanied by intense pain, the wandering soul falls to the ground, unable to open its eyes.
Zhao Xu didn't expect this, and he entrusted Violet's training to her, but she treated him as a sworn enemy in a life-or-death struggle.
This is a sword that will not return once it is drawn, and it is impossible to retreat.
But even the sword master cannot wield such a sword, which directly shocks the 10 or so evil players who followed to chase the autumn wind.
They all cry out in surprise and feel like they are running away in all directions, towards the direction of the mist, as if it is safer there.
Violet stands still, holding her sword, with no hint of bloodlust or bloodstained aura.
On the contrary, a chilly atmosphere emanates from her, and in the eyes of countless people, Violet is a saintly figure, with her hair gently blown by the wind."
Other ignorant common people knelt down directly on the ground, as if they had seen a divine messenger.
