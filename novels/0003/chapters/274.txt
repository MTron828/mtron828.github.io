At this point, Zhao Xu's originally confident "fireball technique" has disappeared without a trace. There are over a hundred high-level phantoms here, and his fireball technique only has a 50% chance of killing the opponent. However, these high-level phantoms exceed the current limit of his spell damage. He had to pretend to be like a zombie, hobbling step by step, looking for gaps among these phantoms to pass through. 

For Zhao Xu, this game of Arthur instantly turned into a single-player horror challenge. When he squeezed past two phantoms, they were flying in mid-air, and Zhao Xu's height only reached their leg position. But the phantoms themselves were elusive and had slight movements, accompanied by a pale and eerie atmosphere, their bodies constantly fluttering in front of him. 

Several times, these phantoms, resembling "ghosts" from the earth, directly brushed past Zhao Xu's nose, almost causing him to sneeze. "Can they withstand this kind of pressure?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel surprised and somewhat sympathetic. 

At this point, Zhao Xu also discovered that what he thought was the end was actually just a transitional room with a huge solid pillar in the middle blocking the way. After bypassing it, there was still a straight corridor several meters wide, but there was no light behind, everything was in darkness. 

At this point, Zhao Xu cast a second-level spell on himself, "dark vision," which could last for a full 5 hours. But after seeing the details in front of him, he stopped in his tracks. He originally thought that searching for the teleportation key in the pit of bones was disgusting enough. But now, in front of him, there were hundreds of ghouls feasting on the road ahead. 

"Disgusting. Master, I'll take a nap first, call me when you're through," Lux immediately said.
