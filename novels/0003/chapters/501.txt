Chapter 502: The Domain of Decline, Violent Mage

After completing the transaction with the Shen family siblings, Zhao Xu accelerated his pace and headed towards the secret location of the six sisters' lair, which he had learned about in his past life.

Compared to the flat terrain of the alliance's plain, the environment on the Ice Mountain Ridge was even more brutal. The heavy snowfall in the middle of winter had turned everything into a uniform white, and even veterans could easily become snow-blind, making it impossible to distinguish directions and positions.

Without sufficient survival levels, even a wandering hunter would struggle to find the correct path in such a snowy environment. However, Zhao Xu effortlessly executed the "Earth Pulse Exploration" technique, a skill unique to wandering hunters.

A green energy flashed through his mind, creating a map of the surrounding terrain, displaying cities, villages, and famous ruins within a 50-kilometer radius. Even after the energy dissipated, the images remained vivid in his mind, allowing him to clearly gauge his distance from his target.

This also meant Zhao Xu didn't need to use skills like "Finding the Shortest Path" or "Teleportation" to get there. Moreover, he needed to allow time for the Shen family siblings to make contact.

By the next day, Zhao Xu estimated that his carriage should arrive at the first destination around the time he wanted. He also managed to locate the six sisters' lair.

Deep in the Absolute Peak Valley, a secluded crevice was hidden amidst the snowscape. As Zhao Xu approached, he had already activated his camouflage technique, making it difficult for outsiders to detect his invisible state amidst the wind and snow.

After observing for a while, Zhao Xu noticed that there were no unusual movements around him, only a very ordinary snowy landscape.
Here is the translation:

If Zhao Xuyu didn't know this direction, it's likely that most people would find it hard to imagine that this is the lair of the sixth sister.

As a wizard, Zhao Xuyu wouldn't waste his time waiting for someone to come and go before opening the big door. He took a few steps around the perimeter, then quietly approached a mountain cave wall and directly raised his staff.

Suddenly, a mysterious golden light shot out from his hand - the "Pierce Wall" spell.

This five-ring spell of the wizard made all the underground city walls collapse, turning them into a joke.

The "Pierce Wall" spell can create a 3-meter-deep tunnel on wooden walls, stone walls, or even stone walls, and with a foundation of 9-level spells, it can add 2 meters of depth every 3 levels. Finally, relying on his 17th-level staff, Zhao Xuyu directly created a 6-7 meter tunnel.

Without any delay, Zhao Xuyu rushed in and quickly cast a temporary shield spell outside the wall.

Just a few steps in, he discovered that his direction was wrong, and the location was not accurate, so the 6-meter range did not penetrate the wall body, only forming a short tunnel.

If he had mastered the "Phantom Body" spell, he could have floated through the entire route.

Zhao Xuyu didn't think too much and continued to use the "Pierce Wall" spell to clear the way.

The spell's power burned like a candle flame, instantly melting the path ahead, and the bright lights suddenly shone through.

"Who's there?"

A sudden cry echoed through the air.

Zhao Xuyu was taken aback.

Wait a minute...

Clearly, when he was invited to come here, the location of the middle segment tunnel hadn't been set up, otherwise Zhao Xuyu wouldn't have wasted two "Pierce Wall" spells to break in.

"Boom."
"Boom."
Here is the translation of the text:

Immediately, a deafening sound came, and even Zhao Xu, hiding in the tunnel, could hear it clearly.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but exhale sharply, and the air blast blew his hair away.

Although he had intended to play a stealth game, he had inadvertently switched to an all-out attack mode.

To think that he could simply use a fireball to blast open the door, exposing the large door.

At this moment, a warrior, armed with a sword and wearing a simple suit of armor, blocked the last opening Zhao Xu had created with his wall-penetrating technique. The warrior's silhouette was faintly visible under the faint light.

Zhao Xu didn't waste any time and charged forward.

As a 8th-level mage who had mastered the "Domain of Decline" spell and possessed 16 points of unnamed power, he was now more like a powerful warrior.

"Who are you? Get down!" the patrolling warrior yelled, relying on the faint light behind him to sense the approaching cold wind, as if the icy air from outside had seeped in.

However, the Zhao Xu in front of him was holding a relatively slender "mud jade" wooden staff and knocking it down towards his head.

The original stealth technique suddenly disappeared.

The guards in the lair couldn't help but shout in shock, unable to comprehend how a man in a robe was swinging a wooden staff at him.

"Bang-bang." The two sounds were interrupted.

The cry of pain also suddenly ceased.

Zhao Xu, although a mage, had taken advantage of the benefits of his dual elite professions.

Under the condition of a 7th-level mage with a 3-tiered attack level, he had already reached a 5-tiered attack level and awakened his past life's combo ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

After this, the 6-level attack hierarchy is something that Zhao Xu himself needs to research and explore, and it also represents the beginning of his learning of basic martial arts as a wizard.

As for this unlucky patrolman who came from nowhere, he can hardly understand why his armor looks like paper and is unable to withstand the enemy's weapons.

Even the wizard's staff seems to be gigantic and unreal, like an illusion. The staff, which appears to be less than a meter long, hits him like a wall.

Zhao Xu, who is watching the warrior with his mouth bloody and unconscious on the ground, silently nods his head.

"What's going on?"

"Quickly notify the adults."

At this time, a patrol team from behind rushes over, dressed in leather armor and looking quite unimpressive. They gaze at Zhao Xu with an air of caution.

No one can understand why the guard who can ring the alarm bell will be knocked down after two clear sounds, especially since the opponent looks like a wizard holding a staff.

At this moment, Zhao Xu is smiling and carelessly waving his staff, selecting targets in front of him.

The opponent is puzzled by the reason. It's not hard for him to understand, because no one would have guessed that Zhao Xu's strength has reached 24 points after adding 16 points from the "Death Domain" of the "Dying Domain", which is 8 points higher than the initial strength.

The person in front of him, without relying on any other states, can easily reach 12 levels (5 professions + 7 strength adjustments + 2 weapon enchantments - 2 flaws) with his pure attack power.

In terms of damage, the "High-Grade Unusual Strike" spell, which can convert weapon power into "giant" level damage, is a level 1 hour spell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu had always needed to go into battle to unleash his full potential. Now, his spellcaster level has effortlessly reached level 23, and he has become a natural-born "wake-up" buff, always 24 hours a day.

As he swung his staff, he also brought 1.5 times the additional damage, which was roughly around 10 points. This was also the first time Zhou Xu had enjoyed the benefits of additional power, as previously he had lacked the strength to deal damage due to his low physical strength.

As a result, these people couldn't imagine that the Zhou Xu before them was essentially a warrior of the same level as a 7th-level warrior.

As he looked at the group of low-level thugs, Zhou Xu didn't show any mercy, continuing to charge forward with his staff, crushing each one like a whirlwind sweeping away leaves.

Suddenly, the narrow tunnel, originally designed for defense, was filled with the screams of the wounded. "Violent Mage, this is pretty cool, I guess."

Zhou Xu felt a slight sweat on his body, turned around, and looked back at the artificial tunnel he had created, which was now filled with bodies and bloodstains.

"Not to mention, when a mage with equipment is too arrogant," Zhou Xu thought to himself.

Just then, he recalled the feeling of being beaten up at the bar by a group of people who didn't like him.

At that time, they were punching and kicking each other, with bones and muscles colliding.

But this time, each person was armed with a weapon, and Zhou Xu, holding a wooden staff, was the most cautious of all.

This kind of battle didn't even make him feel a bit anxious.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A faint 'whoosh' sound echoed through the air."

Zhao Xu's eyebrows shot up, but he didn't trigger his defensive magic to dodge.

Instead, he saw a black arrowhead hovering in mid-air, and it suddenly pierced his body, passing through all his defensive barriers.

What a powerful foe!

Zhao Xu merely twisted his body slightly, and the sharp arrowhead was deflected, falling to the ground.

[**Summer Adventurer, your "Evasion" skill has been activated, and the Star Cloak effect has triggered, reducing damage taken by 50%.**]

As Zhao Xu reached level 7, he would always wake up in the morning to find that the four-ring magic relic of the treasure hunter had been automatically equipped, granting him the ability to dodge and weave through attacks.

With this ability, he could also enhance the Star Cloak's damage reduction effect from 50% to 100%.

As long as his evasion didn't fail, it would be impossible for ordinary people to hit him.

"Ah? Still got some skills left."

As Zhao Xu looked around, he saw a girl with a long, curly hairstyle, wearing a chainmail shirt, staring at him with a mixture of surprise and curiosity on her face.

"Get out of my way," Zhao Xu said coldly.

As he gazed at the girl who resembled Zheng Xin'ao by about 60%, he knew that the blood on her hands wouldn't be few, but he still didn't take the initiative to attack.

After all, he wasn't a completely righteous guardian yet...

"...Sister Violet, how much longer until we arrive?"

The sound of a horse-drawn carriage came to a halt, and Zheng Xin'ao, looking like a carefree and innocent girl, turned to the calm and serene woman sitting beside her, who was flipping through a magic tome, and asked.
Here is the translation:

"It's at least a week, right? You're about to start school?" Wang Qingwei asked, "The road after joining the Northern Alliance is all snow-covered mountains, it's not that easy to walk."

"Not really, but luckily I met my sister, otherwise, I don't know how long it would take to complete this mission journey to Starfall Town," Zheng Xin'an smiled, and for some reason, she felt very comfortable sitting beside this female mage.

It's no wonder she heard the name so many times when she was training in Mistral.
"Since we're both from the portal in Luca City and our destinations are the same, it's meant to be, isn't it?" Wang Qingwei also smiled, looking at the girl who seemed to have stepped out of a painting, and her heart was also burning with excitement.
