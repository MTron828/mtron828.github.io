Chapter 72: The Eve of Departure

Caesar's team set off at dawn outside the town, and Zhao Xu had to prepare his magic and occult arts two hours earlier. He hadn't practiced his magic the day before, so he had to prepare everything from scratch. However, after meeting his four friends from the benevolent camp, Zhao Xu decided to revise his preparations.

The "Multitalented Mage" can help Zhao Xu bypass the limitations of preparation for magic and occult arts, but the cost of the two art slots is ultimately not cheap. As a child from a poor family, Zhao Xu had to prioritize thriftiness in the early stages.

Preparations usually require a quiet environment, so Zhao Xu found a temporary ordinary room at the inn from the day before. In Arthur's town, most inns and taverns are combined, and ordinary citizens rarely stay here. This is a place where adventurers often gather to socialize and gather information, making it easier for players to gather information.

After Zhao Xu finished his meditation and prayer, he began to inspect and clean his weapons.

Anastasia gave him a convenient bag at the beginning, which already contained a lot of adventure supplies. Although there were no magical items, the variety was rich and complete, sufficient to meet the needs of an individual adventurer.

The lightweight crossbow in his hand was his remote weapon for the next stage, with a damage of 1D8, much higher than his zero-level magic. This is also the reason why mage players are often ridiculed, as their damage output is not as good as that of non-magical players.

However, this 35GP lightweight crossbow is still a relatively affordable option for mage players.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not that the players are stingy and unwilling to spend money on equipment, but rather that Arthur's arrows are still unaffordable. One gold coin can only buy 10 arrows, and with each shot, it's like losing a silver coin. After checking the tension of the bowstring, Zhao Xu casually loaded an arrow. Then, he gave his wooden staff a quick polish and attached it to his waist with a buckle.

Zhao Xu's previous dual-wielding swords were quite impressive, but as a novice monk, he can only specialize in lightweight weapons. Unless he is willing to spend more time and effort, he won't be able to master the giant sword, which is a military-grade weapon. Using it forcefully would only make him lose the feeling of unity between man and weapon, and it would be difficult to hit the target.

Glancing at the sandglass, Zhao Xu quickly gathered his belongings and headed downstairs. At this time, the other players had already logged in and were waiting for him at the tavern. Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly and Caesar, who was busy, still had his subordinates prepare a carriage to take them to the outskirts to gather.

Zhao Xu and the others exchanged a greeting and boarded the carriage, which jolted gently as it moved slowly out of the city. With Zhao Xu's presence, the atmosphere became a bit awkward, and the originally lively team fell silent.

Zhao Xu took a good look at his character card and began to think of various contingency plans. Previously, his battle against Anniya was a game of unlimited guidance, and he could freely improvise or even undo his moves.
Here is the translation:

In the wild battle, where life and death are intertwined, many players experience a transformation in their actions for the first time, and it's not uncommon for weapons to drop to the ground. However, looking at the character card, Zhāo Xù's brow gradually furrows.

The line "潜能点：0/5" has been appearing since the beginning, and has remained largely unchanged to this day. Zhāo Xù can only let out a sigh, as this ability is stronger than even a dual elite. Unfortunately, it can only be restored through leveling up or waiting for the day when he can use the spell to restore his potential points.

All he can do now is fantasize about how he can crush all the other players in the future. "Mr. Zhōng Xià, why didn't you start out as a bard like Qing Wū Gē Gē?" said the priestess sitting in the corner, breaking the silence in the carriage.

Zhāo Xù lifted his head slightly, looking a bit stunned. This little girl is so full of personality, and yet she's not even willing to mention some things.

The priest's 1st-level spell list and the wizard's 1st-level spell list have both overlapping and non-overlapping parts. When facing a player like the Monkey King, it's easy to tell.

He was afraid of losing his priest's spells and wizard's auras yesterday, which would lead to others questioning him, especially in the presence of bards and priests who can cast spells.

That's why he chose to play the role of a "guide" that most players are not familiar with. As long as he uses his abilities, he will justify it by saying it's a guide's spell.

Knowing the risks of wild battles, Zhāo Xù is also afraid that acknowledging his abilities will affect the judgments of these few players.
Here is the translation of the text:

The road ahead of our team is still good; however, we really encountered a crisis when we entered the Tian Duan mountain range. It's almost a 9 out of 10 chance that we'll be in a life-or-death situation.

Arthas' outdoor skills are not about monsters being refreshed by region. After a conflict occurs, our team will become the focus of attention for countless monsters.

The echoes of battle, the smell of blood, and the startled birds in front of those monsters are like beacons signaling our presence.

So, the situation is not looking good, and it's best for everyone to run away.

As for me, I'm only a level 1, and I'm more concerned about seeking my own fortunes.

I'm thinking of directly contacting the underground forces' smuggling team, as I don't want to put too much pressure on myself.

Even the righteous faction is aware of the importance of retreating. Those who don't retreat are called saints.

After thinking for a moment, I replied, "Because I caught a cold that day."

When I said this, the wanderer Rainbow, who was counting the number of iron thorns in his hand and couldn't spare a thought, lifted his head and looked at me.

"What does it have to do with anything?" the pastor asked curiously.

"Yeah, I don't care if I choose a poet or a guide," I said with a smile.

The entire carriage fell silent immediately.

In my heart, I felt quite relieved; I didn't want to reveal that the pastor's sister would ask me what spells I'm preparing for today.

I wouldn't say anything or not say anything; it's better to maintain a cold demeanor from the start.

I'll take care of my own life; I don't need to rely on a few friends to protect me.

Now, many star players with powerful specializations have appeared on the forum.

Everyone undergoes the same training, and if you can learn additional specializations and become unique, you'll stand out.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The post about Zhao Xu becoming a pastor on the forum went viral and then died down after the poster failed to provide any new evidence.

Fame represents income in the era of Earth's traffic, but for someone like Zhao Xu who is used to living a low-key life, it will only be a burden.

Suddenly, the car's tires screeched to a halt, breaking the peace inside the car.

Zhao Xu opened the carriage door and got off the carriage.

Just as he was about to leave at the dawn of the new day, he looked at the cargo in front of him and was taken aback.

This trip was truly blessed by the goddess, with no unexpected events.
