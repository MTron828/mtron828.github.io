Chapter 7: The Eve of the Journey

Caesar's carriage team had already gathered outside the town at dawn. Zhao Xu had to get up two hours earlier to prepare his magical and arcane abilities.

He had not practiced magic yesterday, so he still had to prepare. However, after befriending the four companions, Zhao Xu decided to revise his spell preparations.

The "Multitalented Mage" could help Zhao Xu bypass the limitations of his magical and arcane preparation, but it would eventually come at a high cost. As a poor child, Zhao Xu had to prioritize thriftiness in the early stages.

Magical preparation usually requires a quiet environment, so Zhao Xu found a temporary room at a tavern from the day before. Most taverns and inns in Arthur's town were combined operations, and ordinary citizens rarely stayed there. It was mainly adventurers who frequented these places, making it easy for players to gather information.

After Zhao Xu finished meditating and praying, he began to inspect and clean his weapons.

Anniya had given him a convenient bag at the beginning, which already contained a lot of adventure supplies.

Although there were no magical items, the variety of supplies was sufficient to meet the needs of a single adventurer.

The light crossbow in his hand was his remote weapon for the next journey, dealing 1D8 damage per shot, much higher than his zero-level spell. This is also the reason why mage players are often criticized for being one level below average. The damage of spells has not yet reached a level of balance or shooting high.

However, this 35 GP light crossbow is still affordable even for a mage player.
Here is the translation:

It's not that the players are stingy and unwilling to spend money on equipment; it's just that Arthur's crossbow is still too expensive for everyone to afford. One gold coin can only buy 10 crossbow arrows, and each shot represents a significant expenditure. After checking the smoothness of the trigger on his lightweight crossbow, Zhao Xu also loaded a new arrow. He then polished his wooden staff, which had rough spots, and attached it to his waist using a buckle. Zhao Xu's past life was proficient in wielding both hands, wielding a giant sword with great skill. However, as a monk, his profession only allows him to specialize in lightweight weapons. Unless he is willing to spend more time and effort, he will not be able to master the giant sword, which is a military-grade weapon.

If he forces himself to use the giant sword, he will lose the sense of unity between man and weapon, making it harder to hit his target. Looking at the sandglass, which was almost up to the agreed-upon time, Zhao Xu gathered his belongings and went downstairs directly. At this time, a few players had already logged on and were waiting for him outside the tavern. Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly, Caesar was still doing things his way, and he was willing to call his subordinates to send a carriage to take them to the outskirts to gather.

Zhao Xu and his companions exchanged greetings and boarded the carriage, which creaked and swayed as they slowly left the city. With Zhao Xu joining the group, the atmosphere became slightly awkward, and the originally lively team fell silent. Zhao Xu glanced around at the various carriages and horses, which were not unusual sights to him. He began to think about various contingency plans, recalling his past battle against Aniella, which was an unlimited-time strategy game.
Here is the translation:

The fierce battle in the wild, where lives are on the line, has caused many players to undergo a transformation, with weapons scattering on the ground not being uncommon. However, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed as he gazed at the character card. The ability bar "Potential Points: 0/5" had remained largely unchanged since its appearance. Zhao Xu could only sigh, knowing that this overpowered ability was stronger than even a dual-elite player. Unfortunately, it could only be restored through leveling up or waiting for the day when he could cast a restoration spell. All he could do now was fantasize about how he would crush other players in the future.

Just then, a priestess sitting in the corner broke the silence, saying, "Mr. Zhongshua, why didn't you start by becoming a wandering poet like the Frog King? The Frog King didn't even undergo formal training, yet he can still cast spells just like a poet." Hearing these words, Zhao Xu raised his head slightly, looking somewhat puzzled. These days, even young girls were so full of personality, and yet they would still insist on doing things their own way.

The priestess's 1st-level spellbook and the mage's 1st-level spellbook had both overlapping and non-overlapping parts. Confronting a player with monkey-like abilities, one could easily tell. Yesterday, Zhao Xu was afraid that his priest spells would be mistaken for mage spells, causing others to suspect him, especially in a group with bards and priests. That's why he chose to use the title "Guide" for this occupation that most players were not familiar with. As long as he could cast it, he would claim it was a Guide's spell with conviction.

Deeply aware of the risks in the wild, Zhao Xu was also afraid that acknowledging his abilities would influence the judgments of these few players.

The road ahead of our team is still good, but we really faced a crisis when we entered the Tian Duan Mountains. It's a 10-to-1 situation.

Arthur's outdoor skills don't imply that the monsters are refreshed by region. After a conflict breaks out, our team becomes the focal point for countless monsters.

The echoes of battle, the bloody smell of the wounded, and the startled birds in front of those monsters are like beacons signaling our presence.

So, the situation is not right, and it's definitely best for everyone to run for their lives.

As for me, I'm currently at level 1, and I'm more focused on seeking my own good fortune.

I'm going to directly contact the underground forces' smuggling team, and I'm not too worried about the psychological pressure.

Even the forces of good will run away from evil. Those who don't run are called saints.

I thought about it and said, "Because I caught a cold that day."

As soon as I said this, Rainbow, who was counting the number of iron lotus seeds in her hand and couldn't be distracted, looked up and gazed at me.

"What's the relationship?" the priest asked lazily.

"Yeah, I didn't choose to be a poet or a mentor, and it's not related," I said with a smile.

The entire carriage fell silent immediately.

In my heart, I felt quite relieved. I didn't say this to the priest, but she would probably ask me what spells I prepared for today.

If I said yes or no, it wouldn't make a difference. It's better to maintain a cold demeanor from the start.

I'll take care of myself, and I won't rely on these few players to protect me.

Currently, there are many famous players with strong specializations on the forum.

Everyone has received the same training, and if you can learn additional specializations, you'll become unique.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The post about Zhao Xu becoming a pastor on the forum has gone cold, and the author is unable to provide any new evidence, so the heat has decreased.

Fame is a representative of income in the era of earth traffic, but for someone like Zhao Xu who is wealthy in silence, it will only be a burden.

Suddenly, the screeching of the car's brakes shattered the quiet inside the car.

Zhao Xu opened the door of the carriage and got off the horse.

As he looked up at the dawn breaking at the dawn time, he was taken aback by the sight of the cargo in front of him.

This trip was truly blessed by the goddess, with no unexpected events.
