Chapter 608 The Players' Family
After thinking it through, Zhao Xu's actions also accelerated.
His top priority now is probably to find a way to leave this "mysterious cave" as soon as possible, and then use that as a base to attract other high-end players.
At this moment, within the team, relying on his "charm" and "negotiation" skills, he is able to control the current team without the need to reveal his identity.
All along, An Tinoya's teaching to him has been - compared to spells, secrecy is the true barrier of a mage.
In mage battles, the reason why intelligence is paramount is to know the opponent's cards, in order to make targeted moves.
A mage who shows off is no different from a fool.
This is also the reason why Zhao Xu always adheres to not revealing his identity in outdoor adventures unless necessary.
To be blunt, he no longer has the patience to play along with the small fry, and how can he justify his strengthened fly swatter without fighting a tiger?
Even Ernest once cast a "forget" spell on her name to protect An Tinoya.
This made generation after generation of new students in the floating city believe that this mysterious female mentor was not much older than them.
So, before Zhao Xu could use the projection technique of a seventh-circle mage and a sixth-circle poet, he was not even willing to speak in public at Yanan's open event.
"A second-circle scroll?"
Here is the translation:

The young man, who was trying to find a replacement for the Starlight, was astonished and said, "Master Starlight, you should know that a scroll of a two-ringed spell is worth 150 gold coins, even if it's copied and the spell disappears, and rewriting a two-ringed spell costs only 100 gold coins."

"Besides, keeping the 'Magic Scrolls' is not a bad idea, is it?" the young man added, with a cat owl perched on his shoulder, which could enhance his 3rd-level scouting ability in dim environments. With the "Alertness" specialization, it can be said that this is a crucial element for a beginner wizard to survive.

"For me, time is more valuable," said Zhao Xu.

As for the "Wise Heart" ability, he would not reveal it.

However, it's true that without preparing magic books, following Anniya's words, it is very dignified.

From now on, there's no need to carry a large number of magic books. A ordinary blank spellbook with only 100 pages of space can weigh as much as 3 pounds and cost over 15 gold coins.

"Aiya," the young wizard said, looking thoughtful.

Seeing the other person's reaction, Zhao Xu continued to lower his tone.

He believed that his words would slowly spread after these people left.

"At this time, Aria has the 'Wizard's Association' from the Starlight City, so in the future, the wizard department in the Wasteland will also belong to Aria."
"Other nations' wizards will not rashly enter the Wasteland, and when that time comes, the composition of the department will be mainly made up of player wizards."
"And I can tell you one piece of news: wizards who reach Aria can normally exercise their rights in the Wizard's Association and can upgrade for free, obtaining two two-ringed spells. You can receive it in Aria."
Of course, it is necessary for the other party to transfer their membership to Aria.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu's registration as a member of the wizarding association was initially affiliated with Mistral, but he was later appointed as the president of the wizarding association in Starfall Town, and thus transferred to the Starfall Town Wizarding Association.

At the time when the young wizards were hesitating, a sudden burst of adventurers emerged in front, startling the old wanderer, Uncle, into a state of shock.

Now, the wanderer is no longer exploring with "resurrection stones" but with "life" as their guide.

Ordinary mechanical traps don't scare them, but magical traps do. If they trigger a fireball trap, it's uncertain whether 20 people won't get knocked down by a third.

Next, two unfamiliar teams began to make contact with each other, exchanging information.

Fortunately, the high-level players had a tacit understanding beforehand, and even had a group chat. As a result, Zhou Xu's team suddenly expanded to over 50 people.

When the opposing team introduced the last woman, everyone was astonished and forgot the past.

Including the famous Cai Wei sisters, who were also staring at the opposing woman.

The Dwarf King's Pearl in the front line of the Maraca City, 7th-level Ranger Na Liria, was still wearing the "Golden Hammer" badge given by the Dwarf King on her chest, with the "Noon Magic" skill on her bow, shining brightly like a ray of light.

"Mr. Lone Star, it's been a long time," Na Liria smiled at Zhou Xu.

The crowd gazed at Zhou Xu with astonished eyes, clearly indicating that he was not just an ordinary wizard.

Before crossing over, Na Liria relied on the Dwarf King's provision of weapons and craftsmanship, and her commerce had already taken over nearly 20% of the Maraca City's market share, with personal wealth unimaginable.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although most of the industries of the opposite party are still located in Makka City, and they are wary of strangers, they are very generous to a select few who have earned their trust. However, when it comes to the "Dwarf King's Court", it's a different story. Therefore, Naliria is recognized as one of the few strong individuals who can recover their industries after crossing over.

As for some players who have built their wealth by rolling snowballs, they may have already been consumed and left with nothing.

This is the same as the same adventure, and the Three Sisters of Rose will be tightly combined into a team. However, Naliria has more than ten followers by her side, which is equivalent to one-third of the opposing team.

As Zhao Xu微微 bent down, Naliria also showed a shy smile, "At that time, I really didn't recognize the giant's might. The leader of the Summer Palace, who represented the Starfall Town, came to purchase supplies, but I didn't want to intervene in the internal struggles of the Northern Alliance, so I missed the 'trade' at that time."
"Now that I think about it, the leader of the Summer Palace must have been preparing for the survival of the entire population of the Earth after crossing over."
"I'm really a sinner of the Earth human, and my current situation is self-inflicted."
Zhao Xu smiled and shook his head, "Naliria Miss, I'm afraid you need to ask for a direct explanation."

The real Summer Palace did not care about this topic, and no matter how he explained it, someone would be dissatisfied. Therefore, he did not answer formally.

On this day, no matter how well he did, someone would ask him why he didn't contact them earlier and didn't use more means to let the vast majority of Earth humans know. But he didn't think about it, and as soon as he opened his mouth, he would be targeted by this world because of his leak.
Here is the translation of the text:

Leaving the "Anshen" and "Magical Goddess" out of sight, Zhao Xu at that time did not dare to pretend to be too powerful, so even players didn't use their "true identities" and get to know each other, but only held up the name of the Starfall Guild. The deep-sea demon king was always watching Zhao Xu.

As soon as a follower knew that Zhong Xia had left the sphere of influence, Grazzit would descend again, and Zhao Xu would have to re-predict the "Descend" of the Goddess, which was also the reason why the other side thought he was called the Lonely Star. Even the current "Underground Mysterious Cavern" was the same.

Who knows if there are one or two followers of Grazzit among the players. Therefore, before Zhao Xu reached the "Transmission Portal", he would publicize his identity in the mysterious space occupied by the undead being, which would be the most dangerous moment since he crossed over. Then Zhao Xu would tell about the things that happened when he met the other side's brother and two other follower warriors, Bai Sha and Nü Yu.

As for Nalüli, she was surprised and then showed a worried expression, and then shook her head. "The current Wasteland of Death is like a chaotic furnace in times of turmoil. I can barely take care of myself, let alone do anything about them."

Although the mysterious magician on the other side had revealed the location, time, and approximate location of the camp, everything in the current Wasteland of Death was in chaos, and even top-level players with levels 7 or 8 could easily become street corpses the next day. So Nalüli, even with a fortune of millions, was powerless.

"Lüya, are you really not going to go?" Just then, the female magician on the side, who was Nalüli's personal magic consultant, said.

At that moment, in the chaotic mysterious area, everyone instinctively tended to use their "game ID" to address each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

Natalia shook her head, "In this desolate wasteland, who can guarantee that we can find a person and bring them back safely?"

Although the gods' priests and various powerful forces had sent personnel to infiltrate the desolate wasteland, they were ultimately only concerned with rescuing, and it was uncertain if they would come to Natalia's aid.

Especially, since the other party didn't even know Natalia's younger brother, it was pointless to ask for help.

"No," the female mage said, shaking her head. "Even if the other four-ring mages had mastered the 'biological positioning technique', they wouldn't be able to provide assistance. However, the solo mage who has seen Natalia's younger brother can use the biological positioning technique to locate his position."

As she spoke, the female mage licked her lips and eyed the self-proclaimed 5-star player, Zhao Xu. "As long as we can provide that four-ring scroll."

Natalia's eyes lit up, and she exclaimed, "700 gold coins for a four-ring scroll is a burden for others, but it's not enough to buy a weapon for me."

However, her expression soon turned gloomy again. "Magic scrolls are always in short supply, and the four-ring 'biological positioning technique' is something I can obtain in the Makar City, but in this desolate wasteland, it's..."

"And we're still trapped here, and we don't even know if we can succeed or escape."

As Natalia spoke, the others who were still looking at her with envy also fell silent, their faces gloomy.

"I should have just stayed home," one of the sisters, Qingyu, said, her eyes welling up with tears.

At this time, the wilderness was like a blockade on Earth, and the players could only dare to explore nearby.
Here is the translation:

Going far away always poses a huge risk. In the early stages, one has to find distant relatives, which is basically a fantasy.

This is also the reason why Nalisse is worried about her brother. When he's searching for his way, he's definitely going to spend a lot of time outdoors, and after this "Soul Wave" incident, it's unknown whether he's alive or dead.

"I was pregnant and staying with my in-laws, while my husband continued to work in Pengcheng. As a result, I encountered this crossing event. Now, I'm infected by the game and can become a player. But my wife didn't come with me to the big city because she wanted to save money, and now she and our unborn child are in an uncertain fate."

At this moment, a barbarian player suddenly breaks down in tears, as if infected, "What about my wife and child? How can they survive in such a high-pressure environment?"

"Don't cry, now all major bases are registering family members to see if they're players. If your wife finds out you've played as Arthur, she'll report it, and at least you'll receive relatively good treatment. At most, you'll get a discount due to the inability to verify treatment."

In this wilderness camp, players generally rely on their own abilities to seize high-ranking positions.

The "Gun Barrel" takes power.

There's no gunpowder, no diodes, no electromagnetic induction in Arthur. As a professional adventurer, the "Gun Barrel" is the one who takes power.

And in two weeks, even with the passive attributes of the three surrounding areas, players quickly rise to power and occupy high ground.

Countless civilians who crossed over realize that the mighty leaders who used to make a loud noise are now ineffective.

The former CEO of a company with thousands of employees, who could send an email to make hundreds of people work overtime simultaneously, is now struggling to survive in Arthur.
Here is the translation of the text:

The celebrities surrounded by dozens of bodyguards, the "face" that can be exchanged for resources, has lost its appeal and no longer attracts attention.

For each person, living is already a very difficult thing.

The original hierarchical structure and wealth brought by the earth's power elite are beginning to crumble.

On the other hand, the players have built a new order, with an implicit "rule" that is not explicitly stated.

Treat your family well. Even if your family is in another camp, they can be treated well by others. The only thing to pay is to treat the family of other players well.

This is the biggest difference between players and civilians in terms of family treatment.

As time passes, people's emotions about their families also begin to ease.

In the scene, Zhao Xu returned to the original question, "Miss Nadal, if you can join us, I can help you achieve all these things you mentioned."

"I can even provide a 'biological location technique' scroll at this moment."

"And I can also promise that if you join us, the official of Asia can grant your brother a qualification as a law apprentice."

At this moment, Zhao Xu also felt the benefits of his concealed identity.

This price is too low if it were to be opened by Zhong Xia, but it's reasonable if opened by "Lonely Star".

The audience was immediately impressed by Zhao Xu's words, but no one raised any objections.

Value determines status.

As the highest-ranking person in the scene, Nadal naturally received special attention from the "Lonely Star" wizard of Asia.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a return gift, Nalani received the craftsmanship of the "Dwarf King's Court" from the hands of the dwarves and invested it in the alliance with the elves. She even served as a mediator between the two forces.

"'I—"
Originally, Nalani was about to agree, but she hesitated and pressed her lips tightly shut, "I cannot agree to this for now. I need to discuss it with the core members of the merchant guild. I am not only representing myself."

"Alright, I'll give you an answer within three days after I leave."

"Okay."

Zhao Xu naturally agreed.

As the thousand-year-old son sat, he didn't need to rely on life and death to level up. Nalani, who had already accumulated sufficient resources, didn't need to take risks.

"Sorry, this is—"

Just then, the maid, Feiyu, interrupted the question on the side.

However, Nalani immediately waved her hand, "Feiyu, since things have come to this point, hiding it would be meaningless. We can't even gain more benefits relying on ourselves. It's better to borrow the strength of everyone and see if we can find an opportunity."

As she said this, she took out a crystal from her pocket and held it high, saying—

"This is the Olin Crystal, which I obtained from the skull of an immortal being."
