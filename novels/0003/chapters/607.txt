Chapter 608: The Player's Relatives

After thinking it through, Zhao Xu's actions also accelerated.

Currently, his top priority is probably to find a way to escape from this "mysterious cave" as soon as possible. He will then use that as a base to send out a call, recruiting other high-level players to join him.

At this time, within the small team, relying on his "charm" and "negotiation" skills is enough to control the current team, and there is no need to rush to reveal his identity.

As Annie taught him all along, "secrecy" is a true barrier for a mage. In battles between mages, the first priority is to gather intelligence, so as to know the opponent's cards and make targeted moves. A mage who is reckless and open-minded is no different from a fool.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu has always followed the principle of not revealing his identity unless necessary.

To be frank, he has already lost the desire to pretend to be a fool. He doesn't know how to face himself if he doesn't even dare to take a tiger by the tail.

Even Ernest once used the "forgetting" spell to protect Annie, making it seem like she was someone of about the same age as the new students in Floating City.

Therefore, before he can cast the "Projection Technique" of the 7th circle of mage and the 6th circle of poet, he is not willing to perform on stage in public.

"Second-layer scroll?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The young man, who had just tried to replace him, was astonished and said, "Mr. Lone Star, you should know that a scroll of a two-ring spell is worth 150 gold coins, even if it leads to the loss of the spell. Recreating a two-ring spell would only cost 100 gold coins." 

"Moreover, keeping a 'magic scroll' is not more practical, is it?" the young man added, as he was still holding a cat-like eagle on his shoulder, which could enhance his 3rd-level scouting ability in dim environments. With the "vigilant" specialization, it could be said that it was a crucial element for a novice wizard's survival.

"To me, time is more valuable," said Zhao Xu.

As for the "Wise Heart" ability, he would not reveal it.

However, to be honest, without preparing a magic book, it was indeed a very impressive move, as Anniya had said.

From now on, there would be no need to carry a large number of magic books. A blank spellbook with only 100 pages of space would weigh 3 pounds and cost over 15 gold coins.

At this moment, the young wizard also showed a thoughtful expression.

Seeing the opponent's heart moved, Zhao Xu continued to put down his cards.

He believed that his words would slowly spread after these people left.

"At this moment, Ning has the 'Wizard Association' from the Star-Crashing Town, so in the future, the wizard division of the entire wasteland will definitely be in Ning."

"Other powers of other countries will not rashly enter the wasteland to take office, and at that time, the composition of the division will basically consist only of player wizards."

"Moreover, I can tell you a piece of news: wizards who arrive at Ning can normally exercise their rights in the Wizard Association, which means you can level up and obtain two free two-ring spells, which can be obtained in Ning."

Of course, this condition is that the opponent must transfer their membership to Ning.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like the registration of the wizarding association before Zhao Xu, it was affiliated with Mistras, and then he was appointed as the chairman of the wizarding association of Zhongxing Town, and he moved to Zhongxing Town Wizarding Association.

During the process of the young wizard's hesitation, a sudden group of adventurers emerged in front, causing the wandering uncle in the lead to be frightened.

The current wanderer is no longer exploring with "revival stones" but with "life".

Ordinary mechanical traps don't scare them, but magical traps do. The moment the fireball trap is triggered, it's likely that one-third of the 20 people will fall.

Subsequently, two unfamiliar teams also began to interact, exchanging information.

Luckily, high-level players had a tacit understanding beforehand, and some had even made friends through group chats, so Zhao Xu's team suddenly expanded to around 50 people.

When the opponent team introduced the last woman, everyone was astonished and forgot the past.

Even the Rose sisters, the most famous wizards, were also staring at the opponent's woman.

King Dwarven, who was stationed at the forefront of the Maka City on the surface, was a 7th-level Ranger, Na Liya.

At this moment, the high-level woman player still wore the rare "Golden Hammer" badge given by King Dwarven on her chest, and the "Daylight Spell" on her bow, which sparkled with a radiant light, as if the light would flow like a river.

"Mr. Lone Star, it's been a long time," Na Liya smiled at Zhao Xu.

The crowd also gazed at Zhao Xu with curious eyes, clearly indicating that he was not just an ordinary wizard in the realm of Asia.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although the majority of the industries of the other side are still in Macia City, they are wary of outsiders, but are generous to a select few who have earned their trust. However, when it comes to the Dwarf King's Court, things are different. As a result, Nalriya is recognized as one of the few strong individuals who can recover their industry after crossing over.

As for some players who have risen to prominence through financial means, they may have already been consumed by the capital. This is also a challenge for adventurers like the Rose Sisters, who have formed a tight-knit team. In contrast, Nalriya has more than ten followers surrounding her, which has taken up nearly a third of the opposing team.

As Zhao Xiuwen slightly bends down, Nalriya also reveals a shy smile, "At first, I really didn't recognize the greatness of the Tianxia Lord. When the representative of the Tianxia Lord came to the Starfall Town to purchase supplies, I didn't want to intervene in the internal conflicts of the Northern Alliance, so I missed the 'transaction' at the time."

"Now that I think about it, the Tianxia Lord may have been preparing for the survival path of the entire people in the post-crossover era."

"I really should be considered a sinner among humans on Earth. My current situation is also a case of eating my own bitter fruit."

Zhao Xiuwen then shakes his head with a smile, "Nalriya, you may need to verify this in person."

The true Tianxia Lord will not be able to explain this topic in a way that satisfies everyone, so he didn't give a formal answer.

On this day, no matter how well he did, someone will always question why he didn't make contact with the above or use more means to let the vast majority of humans on Earth know.

And he won't think about it, because as soon as he opens his mouth, he will be "targeted" by the world for leaking secrets.
Here is the translation of the text:

Leaving the "Anshen" and "Magic Goddess" out of sight, Zhao Xu at the time dared not to pretend too much, so even players didn't use their "true identities" to get to know each other, only holding the name of the Starfall Guild. The demonic king of the abyss had been watching Zhao Xu all along.

As soon as Zhao Xu's followers discovered that Zhongxue had left the realm, Gratz would descend again, and Zhao Xu would have to relive the "descend" of the Goddess, which was also the reason why the opponent thought he was the Lonely Star. This included the current "Underground Mysterious Cave" as well.

Who knew if there were one or two followers of Gratz among the players. Therefore, before Zhao Xu published his identity at the "Transmission Gate", he would be in the most dangerous moment since his journey began, in the "Mysterious Space" occupied by undead beings.

Zhao Xu then told the story of his encounter with the opponent's younger brother and two other companions, White Sand and Autumn Rain.

Na Shuilu was surprised and then showed concern, shaking her head. "The current Wasteland of Death is like the chaotic furnace of the chaotic era. I, myself, am hard to protect, let alone protect others."

Although the mysterious mage on the other side had revealed the location, time, and general location of their meeting, everything in the Wasteland of Death was chaotic, and even the top 7-8 level players could be killed on the street the next day. Therefore, Na Shuilu, with her bottomless wealth, was helpless.

"Really not going to find out?" said the flying fan, a personal magic consultant of Na Shuilu, who was standing beside her.

At this moment, in the chaotic mystical area, everyone instinctively tended to use their "game ID" to address each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

Naluriya shook her head, saying, "In this chaotic wasteland, who can guarantee that we'll find someone and bring them back safely?"

Although the gods' priests and various powerful forces have sent people to infiltrate the wasteland, they are primarily there to rescue, and it's uncertain whether they'll help Naluriya.

Especially, the other four-ring mages, even if they possess the "Biological Location Technique", would be unable to provide assistance. However, the solitary mage who has seen Naluriya's brother can use the biological location technique to pinpoint her brother's location.

As she spoke, the female mage licked her lips and gazed at herself, claiming to be a 5th-level Zhao Xun. "As long as we can provide that four-ring scroll."

Naluriya's eyes lit up, and she said, "For a 700-gold four-ring scroll, it's a burden for others, but for me, it's not enough to buy a single weapon."

However, her expression quickly turned dull. "Magic scrolls are always in short supply. In the city of Maka, I can get my hands on a four-ring 'Biological Location Technique', but in this wasteland, it's..."

"And we're still stuck here, not knowing whether we'll be able to succeed or leave."

Hearing these words, the others who were still looking at Naluriya with envy also looked gloomy.

"I should have stayed at home," said the younger sister of the Cai sisters, her eyes welling up with tears.

At this time, the wilderness was like a lockdown on Earth, and the players could only dare to explore nearby.
Here is the translation of the text:

Venturing out is fraught with great danger, and in the initial stage, one has to search for distant relatives, which is often a myth. This is also the reason why Naluya is worried about her brother, as he is on a journey to find his way back and may face numerous unknown dangers. "Just like my wife is pregnant and staying at her parents' home, while I'm working alone in Pengcheng, I suddenly got caught up in this game. Now, I'm infected by the game and can become a player. My wife didn't come with me to the big city because of financial constraints, and she and our unborn child's fate is still unknown." The wild man player suddenly burst into tears, as if infected by the game, saying, "What will happen to my wife and child?"

"Don't cry, now, major bases are registering family members to see if they are players. If your wife knows you've played Arther, she will report it, and at least you will receive preferential treatment. The most you'll get is a discount due to the lack of verification." The eldest sister, Qingli, quickly comforted him.

In this wilderness, players generally rely on their own abilities to achieve high-ranking positions. The "gun barrel" has taken over the power. Without gunpowder, transistors, or electromagnetic induction, the adventurer "gun barrel" is the one in charge.

Even in Arther, players can quickly rise to power in just two weeks, occupying high ground. Countless ordinary people who have crossed over have realized that the previously powerful figures, who once made loud declarations, have gradually lost their influence.

In the past, a company with over a thousand employees could be managed by a single email, but even the CEO of Arther has to suffer hunger and cold.
Here is the translation of the text:

The celebrities surrounded by dozens of security personnel, with their "faces" that can be exchanged for resources, have lost their attention. To each individual, living is already a very difficult thing.

The original power and wealth of the old elite on Earth have begun to crumble.

On the other hand, players have built a new order, with implicit rules that are not explicitly stated.

It is good to treat other players' families. Even if one's family is in another camp, the other side can also be treated well. The only thing to pay is to treat the families of other players.

This is the biggest difference between players and civilians in terms of family treatment.

As the emotions of everyone thinking about their families have eased, Zhao Xu returned to the original question, "Ms. Nalira, if you can join us, I can help you achieve all these things you mentioned."

"I can even provide you with a 'biological location technique' scroll right now."

"And I can also promise that, if you join us, the official of Nalira can grant your younger brother a qualification as a mage apprentice."

At this moment, Zhao Xu also felt the benefits of hiding one's identity.

If Zhongxue came out with this price, it would be too low-level.

But since it's coming from me, the "lonely star", it seems reasonable.

When Zhao Xu spoke, everyone in the room also showed envy, but no one objected.

Value determines status.

As the highest-ranking individual in the group, Nalira naturally received special attention from the official of Nalira as a "lonely star" mage.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a natural response, Naliria decided to invest the crafting techniques she had obtained from the "Dwarf King's Court" into Yulan, and even acted as a mediator between the two forces.

"I---"
Originally, Naliria had intended to agree, but after some thought, she pressed her lips tightly shut, saying, "I cannot agree to this for the time being. I need to discuss it with the core members of the merchant guild. I am no longer just representing myself."

"Alright then, I'll give you a response within three days after I leave."

"Okay." Zhao Xun naturally agreed.

Just then, Naliria's younger sister, Qinglu, suddenly asked, "What are you doing down here?" As a former pastor, she had sensed that the path to breakthrough was hidden in the cave below, which was why she had come down.

The son of the king, who sat on the throne, had already accumulated sufficient resources, and Naliria, who had already transcended the cycle of life and death, had no need to take risks.

"Sorry, but---" The servant, Feisu, interrupted the question suddenly.

However, Naliria quickly waved her hand, saying, "Feisu, it's pointless to hide it now. We can't possibly reap greater benefits by ourselves. It's better to seek opportunities together."

As she spoke, she pulled out a crystal from her pocket and held it high, saying, "This is an Olympian crystal, which I obtained from the skull of an immortal being."
