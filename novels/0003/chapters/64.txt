Chapter 65: Magical Pearl

At this moment, the female mage who had been stopped by Anzhi Noya turned around, her expression filled with surprise as she gazed at the two people who had suddenly appeared. Zhao Xu also caught a glimpse of the face hidden beneath the opponent's cloak, recognizing it as the unforgettable Wang Qingwei.

This was their second meeting in a few days.

However, Wang Qingwei had no idea that Zhao Xu had already paid attention to her during the awakening ceremony that day.

After estimating the time, Zhao Xu suddenly realized the connection.

He used the throne of the law to see the historical river of magic, causing the throne to suffer damage. Originally, the novice who had awakened ahead of schedule was sent back to their original form, and it was not until the throne was repaired that they could continue their training.

These two days were when the batch of novices had just become official mages, coming to the square to hone their skills and train in spellcasting.

Zhao Xu let out a slight sigh, still gazing at Wang Qingwei, who had not yet added too many charm skills and lacked the former's aura of captivating the nation. However, he could already sense the underlying foundation. Beauty can add points for women, but combined with powerful strength, it can directly reach the maximum score.

However, Zhao Xu did not have a single moment of infatuation.

After mastering the art and being struck by the recent surge of power, he gradually experienced the state of "nothing but magic exists in the world."

After Anzhi Noya's guidance, Zhao Xu had already gathered his determination as a whole person.

Before him, Wang Qingwei was no longer the top beauty, but the first female mage in King Arthur's court.

"Yeah?" Wang Qingwei's facial expression was serene, without a hint of abnormality.
Here is the translation of the text:

She gazed softly at the administrator who had just walked by.

"Can you recognize them?" a player wizard approached, trying to insert himself between Zhao Xu and Wang Jingwei.

Zhao Xu's expression changed, revealing that Wang Jingwei had never used a pseudonym since entering the game.

"Respected inheritor," the administrator in the gray and gold embroidered robe walked over, bowing to An Tiya.

"It's done, let the female wizard release her spell on him," An Tiya spoke calmly, without a hint of emotion.

"Why should I?" the male player shouted loudly, his neck veins even bulging.

Several players nearby gathered around, curious about what was happening.

Located in the floating city of Mistral, surrounded by no other profession players, these Earth players were more united than ever.

"This lady, please believe me," the administrator beside her suddenly interrupted.

"Please listen to the female wizard's advice and let that wizard release her spell. I assure you that this will have immense benefits for you," the administrator said, his voice deep and persuasive.

Zhao Xu shook his head secretly, thinking that these Earth players had immunity to most control magic spells over the past year.

Perhaps the administrator's opening move was not a gentle suggestion, but rather a subtle influence on Wang Jingwei's mind using dark magic.

"You all move back," An Tiya slightly raised her voice.

As if the voice contained immense magical power, except for the administrator who bowed and stepped aside.

Even the male player who had initially stood up for Wang Jingwei took a step back, unable to resist.
Here is the translation of the text:

The players surrounding her were all stunned by her boldness, and they all had to suppress their speculation about Anzola's level.

"Wow, she's really beautiful," Anzola said, sizing up Wang Qingwei.

Just then, a pearl shot through the air, presenting a perfect parabolic trajectory and landing directly in Wang Qingwei's cloak pocket.

At this moment, she was wearing a makeshift cloak with multiple pockets, which was created by sewing together ordinary cloaks that players couldn't afford to buy.

"As long as you can successfully hit 'Magic Missile' with your force field energy, the items in your pocket are yours," Anzola said, pointing to Zhao Xu behind her.

At this moment, the curious players nearby couldn't help but start discussing.

"That's a pearl?"
"I'm going, that's at least 100 GP."
"We only have a few GP for daily expenses, it's just a material."
"Not bad, Qingwei, the NPC big shot has picked her out from the start."
Wang Qingwei looked at Anzola with a calm expression, shaking her head: "I refuse."
She didn't even glance at the pearl once.

"That's a level 1 mana recovery pearl, 1000 GP," Anzola said with a smile, adding weight to the inner scales of each player's heart.

All the players surrounding her couldn't help but take a deep breath.
1000 GP.
It means different things at different times.
In many cases, it means a lifetime of security and peace for a family of four, allowing them to settle down and live comfortably.
In the past, it also means that players can exchange it for enough to upgrade their armor and weapons and become top-notch.
Here is the translation of the text:

As of now, when everyone's funds are scarce, it's an unprecedented tool that can even be the key to consolidating the power of players. Just by releasing a "magic missile", you can get an item worth 1000 GP.

Several fans of Wang Congwei's are mentally preparing themselves, their desires burning with anticipation on the edge of rational thinking.

They are itching to say "I'm coming." However, Wang Congwei calmly replied, "I refuse."

With that, she directly pulled out the "Level 1 Magic Pearl" from her bag and handed it to An Tiya. "Don't you have enough chips?" An Tiya asked in a flat tone.

"Not me, my spell slots are already exhausted," Wang Congwei replied.

"You can use this Magic Pearl to recover your spell slots," Wang Congwei added.

The administrator, who had been standing aside, stepped forward and interjected, thinking Wang Congwei didn't understand the strength of this mysterious item.

"I can't guarantee your safety under my spellcasting," Wang Congwei replied.

One magic missile could knock out a low-level mage.

The players around were already looking enviously at the unclaimed Magic Pearl, mentally calculating when to make a move to get it.

Attack one player and get an item worth 1000 GP, and it's just a waste of a revival stone, they thought. Who wouldn't be able to afford it when it's just 299 yuan?

"It's on you to cast a spell on me," Zhao Xu suddenly spoke up.

"She's my mentor's come, it's just to let you assess my abilities and all risks will be under their control, so don't worry," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Wang Congwei's demeanor did not become that of a saintly warrior, but rather a sorceress, which was somewhat unexpected to him.

No, it should be said that it was because she was a sorceress that her abilities were sufficient to let her live on.

The premise of ancient heroes was that they could challenge the forbidden.

"Is that so?"
Wang Congwei's gaze was fixed on Zhao Xu at this moment, and upon hearing Zhao Xu's title, she relaxed her vigilance to some extent.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was looking at Wang Congwei's crystal-clear eyes, which seemed to have a hint of impropriety, as if a deep pool of water made one feel that even a slight hint of impropriety was a sacrilegious act. "Not wrong."
