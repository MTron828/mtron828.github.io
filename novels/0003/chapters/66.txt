Chapter 67: The Proud Child of Heaven

"Next time, you can directly refuse me," Annie said with a joke, which made Zhao Xu unable to retort.

"That's what I'll do," he said.

"Teacher, didn't you leave that 'magical pearl' to that lady?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment before asking his puzzled question.

Currently, there are few players who can get this 1000 GP reward, especially since it's just a simple spell.

"No, I remember that pearl is still mine," Annie said.

"Teacher, I'm not asking for everything. I'm strange, why did you do that?" he asked.

"Because in the entire arena, her 'magic missile' is the most skilled and can push you to the extreme, releasing your potential. I chose her, so I naturally have to reward her," Annie explained.

When Zhao Xu heard this, he nodded slightly, but then said, "Teacher, I'm not stupid."

If Zhao Xu were a beginner in the game, he might have believed this.
However, after experiencing the world for ten years, Zhao Xu had thoroughly understood one rule of Arthur's: there is no free lunch in the world.
Every time there is a sudden windfall, there must be a deep underlying reason.
Like a mage who is relatively easy to master, it's also a matter of someone's background.
He wouldn't have felt that the benefits he received were so generous if he weren't a time-traveler.
"Feeling that you're still quite mature," Annie said with an appreciative tone.

"Why do you think she has that magical pearl necklace that increases her spellcaster level by 1?" Zhao Xu suddenly became puzzled.

At that time, he was in the midst of battle, and hadn't had a chance to react yet.

"Is she also a target of our attention?" Zhao Xu didn't realize he had inserted himself into the "final chapter" of the storyline.

"She is a target of the Association of Mages, not us," Annye, the mage, corrected him.

"In reality, you players have been fighting in Aether for a year, trying out different strategies, even with the aid of revival stones. How many levels do you think the vanguard of the first team could reach?" Annye asked.

Zhao Xu, who had already obtained the ancient scroll, hesitated for a moment before answering, "Level 5."

This was the result of a survey conducted by the entire population during the previous life, and the remaining players were those who had surpassed level 10.

"That's correct, but I can tell you that there must be players above level 10 among you." Annye said.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt that he had heard a deep, thunderous roar, as if the night sky itself was screaming.

"You've noticed the extraordinary abilities of that mage, Viola, who actively helps her. And what about us, who have been observing her for half a month? The Association certainly didn't just randomly analyze data on all of you."

Zhao Xu finally realized that the Association of Mages was far more complex than he had thought.

He, Zhao Xu, could react instantly and invest in someone.

The Association of Mages had likely prepared investments long before that.

The venture capital of Blue Star would invest in companies with promising futures, as they represented future wealth.

In Aether, professional levels are the first production force.

Perhaps, in the Blue Star power, all high-level players were basically selected as ambassadors by major powers.

In Aether, native players who reach level 5 in a year are extremely fast.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Earth player doesn't have that kind of reincarnation stone that allows them to die and come back to life. It's also impossible to reach that level.

Those players above level 10, do they have the resources of a powerful force behind them? It's said that Wang Qingwei is the player chosen by the Mage Association. Is it just a coincidence that they met today, or was it fate?

"This is too much conspiracy theory, don't you think?" Zhao Xu was unable to imagine that everything was being manipulated by a large network behind the scenes.

"You're thinking too much," Anniya laughed.

"You're the main object I'm responsible for. I just happened to bring you together with her today," Anniya said.

"She will undoubtedly become the leader of your player group. You and she have been training in the floating city, but you haven't even met yet. It's better for some people to become friends than enemies."

"So, that 'Mana Rebirth Pearl' is the bond between her and me that will be produced in our next meeting, because she will return it to me?"

Zhao Xu felt for the first time that he had a sense of luck and wisdom.

He felt that his true intelligence had risen slightly.

However, he also admired the Mage Association's insight. Wang Qingwei will represent the Earth's forces as an envoy to the Northern Alliance in the future, and the Northern Alliance will treat her according to her royal status.

In other words, the Mage Association has chosen her as one of the leaders of the Blue Star forces.

Zhao Xu hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth to ask why he wasn't chosen. Although he dislikes dealing with such trivial matters, the powerful sense of authority made everyone feel carefree.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mentor, Wang Congwei, was chosen for what reason? Zhao Xu hastily asked, this is an experience that can be replicated.

Annie Noelle cast a fleeting glance at Zhao Xu, as if she could see through his thoughts.

"Wang Congwei's expertise is in 'leadership'," she said.

"This expertise is unfamiliar to me?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.

"Well, our guild master has this expertise. Moreover, he also has a legendary leadership expertise," Annie Noelle said.

"This expertise won't let you cast more spells, but it can give you many powerful allies."

"On the day of the awakening ceremony, I brought you a cloak, and no one recognized you. Today is the first time you've met the girl. She didn't know your special circumstances, and she could resist the temptation of a thousand gold coins, and also because of your response, she directly cooperated with you."

"Even if you didn't have any romantic feelings for her, you still cooperated with her because you knew it was good for her."

"I was about to say -" Zhao Xu left his words unfinished.

Why was he about to invest, rather than take it over?
"Remember, the abilities of expertise are some that transcend magical effects, similar to special abilities. Some people are born with the ability to connect with others, gathering most of the power, and gaining the support of most people."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

The life of a cheater, each has its own characteristics.

The external cheat on the ground cannot be used up by one person.

In his past life, he fought for 10 years to reach level 5, but those proud children of heaven stood on the peak of level 10 in just one year, looking down on them.

Now he stands higher than other players, and it's not acceptable to have a few small hills beside him.
Regardless of the countless changes in the world, what he is pursuing is to become the strongest Arthur, with the sharpest sword as the most refined and deadly blade.
