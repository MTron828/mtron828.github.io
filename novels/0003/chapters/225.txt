Chapter 226: Divine Spirit Attachment

As the "Prayer Candle" continued to burn, it was as if a massive fan was accelerating its speed. In the blink of an eye, it was reduced to almost nothing, and the portal to the heavenly realm, known as the "Otherworldly Gate", began to take shape and stabilize.

Zhou Xuan then opened the "Tuning" book and turned to the page where he had placed a bookmark.

He knew that success or failure hung in the balance at this very moment.

As he gazed at the incantation on the book, Zhou Xuan threw the holy water he held towards the "Otherworldly Gate", marking the start of the ritual.

However, Zhou Xuan was unable to perform the seven-ring "Tuning Heavenly Clan" or the nine-ring "Higher Tuning Heavenly Clan" due to his limitations.

As a result, he needed to summon those celestial beings who possessed the ability to attach the divine spirit to themselves.

These beings would initiate the "Tuning" ritual on their own.

In reality, only the "Throne Angel" possessed this ability, and summoning one would suffice.

However, Zhou Xuan had used the Prayer Candle, indicating his desire to merge with the strongest "Fiery Heaven Servant".

Unfortunately, most "Fiery Heaven Servants" lacked the ability to attach the divine spirit.

To merge with them, Zhou Xuan decided to use the nine-ring "Higher Tuning Heavenly Clan" ritual.

As luck would have it, while browsing through the legendary library, Zhou Xuan had just found a mention in the book "Tuning" that a minority of "Fiery Heaven Servants" possessed the ability to attach the divine spirit.

These beings were specifically tasked with infusing the underworld with the light of goodness.
Here is the translation:

So, Zhao Xu is currently using the " Portal to the Otherworld" based on the incantation in the book to intentionally locate these minority "Fiery Heaven Servants" who possess the ability to have a "Holy Spirit attached".

Compared to summoning all "Fiery Heaven Servants", Zhao Xu's behavior is equivalent to calling a specific model of car, not just randomly calling one. He has set conditions such as the driver's age and vehicle type.

Naturally, the waiting time will have to be endured.

If he fails to wait, Zhao Xu will have to choose a lower-grade "Palace God" as a substitute.

During this waiting period, the "Portal to the Otherworld" originally opened by Zhao Xu began to become unstable.

This is because these "Fiery Heaven Servants" who require very low host requirements are also very busy.

Zhao Xu, seeing this scene, could only helplessly begin to spend his money according to the requirements in the "Tuning" book.

Zhao Xu took a bag of unheated platinum coins and threw it all in.

Instantly, the "Portal to the Otherworld" that was only slightly aglow began to brighten up several notches under the stimulus of such a large amount of money.

However, the portal still did not respond.

But Zhao Xu had no choice but to do so.

Although he could use the "Higher-Tier Tuning Divine Scroll" to sustain the portal for 10 minutes per level, it would not meet his requirement of sustaining it for several days.

Therefore, he must find an opponent who has the ability to have a "Holy Spirit attached".

However, the energy fluctuations in the "Portal to the Otherworld" continued to weaken, and the energy tides became increasingly calm.

If this continued, Zhao Xu would not only waste his 1000 gold coins, but also consume the entire prayer candle.

At this point, Zhao Xu made up his mind.

If there is no response again, he will summon a "Palace God".
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Zhao Xu began to survey his reserves, preparing to discard another item. However, most of his precious stones had been consumed by the "Gem Jump" and "Escape" spells he had used earlier. What was left were items like the "Invisibility Ring" and the "Eternal Wand of Fireball" that were of great use.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze fell on a key - the key that would automatically take him to the "Positive Energy Plane" when grasped by two rollers.

Recalling the close relationship between the Positive Energy Plane and the divine beings of the heavenly tribe, Zhao Xu did not hesitate and directly threw the single-use key into the portal.

He had previously spent 600 gold coins on the "Healing Spell" scroll just to stabilize the key.

Now, the key had become the fertilizer for the "Interdimensional Gate".

As the key fell into the portal, a powerful sacred aura suddenly burst out from the gate. A pure and holy light shone out from within, enveloping Zhao Xu's entire body and making him feel extremely warm.

Immediately after, a "Fiery Heavenly Servant" emerged from the Interdimensional Gate.

Her features were characterized by the saintly beauty of the heavenly tribe, with a clear and piercing gaze that swept around the quiet room.

"Is it you who summoned me?" she asked.

"My master," Zhao Xu replied.

The Fiery Heavenly Servant's protective aura, which was constantly emanating from her body, created an intangible barrier that blocked the surrounding forces.

Since Zhao Xu was not an evil being, he was not affected by the pressure.

"Level 4 Mage, Zhongxia," Zhao Xu introduced himself.

After seeing the Interdimensional Gate close slowly behind him, he let out a sigh of relief.

It's hard to start anything.

He had finally taken the most difficult step.

"Fiery Heavenly Servant, Artoleya," he said.
Here is the translation of the text:

The angel in front of him looked at Zhao Xu with a dignified expression. "I need to go and quell a slave war, and I will strive for the glory of the goddess of reproduction," Zhao Xu said, holding up the holy seal intentionally.

"Okay, tell me where they are, and I'll go and eliminate the evil immediately," the angel replied, her tone very gentle.

"This is mainly because I have special requirements and need to go and slaughter them personally. Can you and I perform a 'sync'?" Zhao Xu said.

Meanwhile, Altoriel, the angel, looked at Zhao Xu with a hint of scrutiny.

"It seems that you can already take out the 'Prayer Candle' at the 4th level, which is not easy to match. It seems that you already know that I am one of the few angels who can possess the Holy Spirit," Altoriel said quietly.

"No, Altoriel, I need your help," Zhao Xu asked.

The heavenly race is not stingy with helping these material beings in the material world and is also struggling to prevent them from falling into hell and the abyss.

The abyss and the fiery pit on the other side are also lacking in various forms of possession.

"That master, have you experienced any stimulation in the past 24 hours?" Altoriel looked at Zhao Xu with a thoughtful expression.

Zhao Xu's mind suddenly flashed back to the forbidden points mentioned in the book "Sync", and he said slightly awkwardly, "I'm just a projection, I don't drink and don't have the tools for that."

The "Sync" ceremony, which is a sacred ritual, requires fasting and bathing, just like in ancient times.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Since it's like that, I'll follow your will, Master. After activating this 'Divine Spirit Infusion' ability, I'll fall into a sleep-like state."

Altoria spoke briefly and to the point, without saying a single unnecessary word.

"It's not like you can't sense the other's state, right?" Xu Zhao said.

"Ah, yes, Master. As an Earth Adventurer, you're protected by divine power, so I can't sense it. Let's just sleep then," Altoria replied, and with that, she activated her ability.

At this point, Altoria was certain that Xu Zhao knew the entire context, so she didn't bother explaining the fine details of the "Synchronization" technique.

Although Xu Zhao wanted to say something, he felt the infusion of divine power and quickly activated his own "Potential Points" to simulate the mysterious skill "Clear Connection" mentioned in the book.

Suddenly, Xu Zhao felt his attributes increasing exponentially, just like when he had transformed into the Fiery God Servant before.

However, the last time he had transformed, he had completely lost his sense of self.

This time, the "Divine Spirit Infusion" was like equipping him with a powerful buff, similar to the "Fiery God Servant" form, but without losing himself.

Throughout the process, Xu Zhao felt a sense of overwhelming power without losing his sense of self.

In the end, after completing the "Divine Spirit Infusion" ritual.

Xu Zhao was still in his original form, but he looked at his character card.

Everything was different now.

He could say it bluntly - he had become a formidable warrior.

Originally, the "Synchronization" process had a huge risk - the target creature would gain access to Xu Zhao's memories, life story, and even be able to communicate with him telepathically.
Here is the translation of the text:

Because Zhao Xu is a projection from Earth, by that day, he could only use the ability of "heart-to-heart communication". Meanwhile, after synchronization, both parties could even detect each other's thoughts if they agreed. Furthermore, after Zhao Xu simulated the expertise of "Clear Spirit Attachment", the original request for consent became automatic, allowing them to read each other's thoughts. However, due to the reason of being a projection from Earth, Zhao Xu could only read the thoughts of the angel, but not the other way around. Therefore, after "synchronization" was completed, the "Firmament God Servant" simply went to sleep, no longer having to bear the loss. This also made Zhao Xu feel somewhat carefree, as if he had obtained a powerful external attachment with no consequences. Although it could only be used for a few days, it meant that no one could block him. He would no longer be like before, only able to watch or fill the gap in strength between the two parties with human life. At this point, Zhao Xu began to review the various abilities he possessed.
