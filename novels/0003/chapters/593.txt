Chapter 594: Incantation of Curse in the Sky

Zhao Xu was shocked to realize that there had never been a similar incident in his past life. The "Spirits' Tide" was indeed terrifying, capable of consuming all solid existence like termites. Once you're wrapped up in it, it means the entire camp will be completely destroyed.

For instance, after being killed by a demonic soul, you'll become a "Corpse" within a few days. Similarly, people killed by a "Soul Reaper" will become a "Soul Reaper" within a few rounds. Victims of vampires will transform into "Vampire Derivatives". And so on.

One careless move, and a powerful immortal creature will enter a group of defenseless humans, and the next day, you might see an entire nest of immortals.

Even if you're killed by a non-contagious skeleton or corpse, you'll be affected by the dark energy field and directly transform into a low-level immortal.

Some evil villains, when enraged, might instantly transform into "Soul Reapers" or "Demonic Souls".

Arthur, this is not a world where death means an end. There's no good way to die, and even souls can't find peace. This is why faith can flourish on this land.

As Zhao Xu's powers grew stronger, his eyes became increasingly grave.

The undead creatures below were already in contact with the scattered humans.

The skeletal remnants, like shattered blocks, executed the orders of the higher-level undead, swinging their swords without hesitation, as if unstoppable monsters.

In an instant, the blood splattered, and indescribable horrors flew everywhere.

The countless militiamen lay on the ground, their eyes fixed on the unbelievable scene before them, with no thought of their own survival. They had endured the initial "hunger" and "desperation", but ultimately failed to withstand the unexpected attack from the undead biological creatures.

As Zhao Xiu gazed upon this scene, he did not return to the battlefield to continue fighting, but instead turned his attention to the negotiation team led by Ailan, who was already more than 500 meters beyond the boundary of the portal.

Even with an endless array of magical techniques at his disposal, he found it impossible to change the current situation.

He thought he had reached the pinnacle, but it seemed that the road ahead was still long.

Zhao Xiu shook his head and turned to cast another spatial magic - Teleportation!

In an instant, his entire body disappeared into the spatial vortex, as if erased from existence.

Meanwhile, the militiamen below were too busy fleeing in disarray, crying out as they retreated towards the main army.

In the face of such a situation, unless another powerful kingdom poured all its strength into this location, no individual could bridge the gap.

A spatial turbulence rippled through the air, and Zhao Xiu suddenly appeared in the command center meeting room.

At this initial stage of development, the various camps did not have many permanent structures, with even high-ranking officers residing in makeshift tents covered with oilcloth.

He looked around nervously, rubbing his hands as he waited for his teammates to return, saying, "Let's all hold hands together and head back to Ailan. This place can no longer hold out."

"With over 100,000 undead biological creatures in this area alone, it's hard to avoid the downfall of Ailan unless all players can be gathered together."

The negotiation team members who heard the words were all stunned, unable to believe that even their most optimistic and future-oriented expectations were no match for the external spiritual tide. For a moment, they were all speechless.

Zhao Xu didn't lie. In reality, the undead legion of tens of millions, even after suffering heavy losses for two weeks, still had over 10 billion people. This was a crushing blow to the enemy.

The key to war was that the undead could concentrate their strength in one place, while the Earth-crossers couldn't. The combined strength of the countless undead legion was enough to overwhelm each battlefield, and then replenish their strength with the corpses of humans.

This was a "no-win" scenario for the Earth, with a scale that far exceeded the previous one.

"Dad, are we humans really going to be wiped out?" asked the negotiator of Yánán's delegation, his voice trembling with fear. At this moment, he didn't even think about his own safety, directly asking the question that concerned the survival or extinction of humanity.

Zhao Xu just shook his head, "If they don't retreat within three days, it's hard to say."

In an instant, he had deduced the intentions of the entire undead legion.

To be honest, even if there were only 10,000 undead, Zhao Xu would still be able to clear them out himself.

The key was that the Wasteland was too vast, and the tens of billions of "Earthlings" were too many.

To put it bluntly, a week later, Zhao Xu might have to face a legion of tens of billions of "undead".

"This is a crisis of extinction, you all go back and lament, I also need to hurry and recover Yánán's remaining strength." Zhao Xu immediately ordered.

As the transmission magic level increases every 3 levels, it can carry an additional person in transmission, and with Zhao Xù's spellcaster level, it can carry an additional 11 people.

Looking at the just-received information, several high-ranking officers in the meeting room couldn't help but open their mouths and ask, "Sir, can you bring more family members from our camp?"

As the news spread to this temporary command center, the entire camp's high-ranking officers realized that this time's raid was not just a small-scale skirmish.

In peacetime, they would spend resources to burn their dead bodies to ashes, fearing that the corpses would transform into undead beings and cause endless trouble. Now, with this situation, it's impossible, and even if the camp can maintain a stalemate with the undead in terms of strength, the number of personnel on both sides will continue to rise and fall, widening the gap, and ultimately leading to being consumed.

Noticing Zhao Xù's indifferent expression, a high-ranking officer quickly added, "This is the key condition for us to join forces with the Eastern Alliance."

The other camp's high-ranking officers heard this and remained silent.

Even if only a limited number of seats are left, as long as there is a chance, they will take it, even if it's not for themselves, but for their families.

Zhao Xù just smiled and said, "Can you decide on the personnel to bring here within one round?"

"You can't discuss the quota within five minutes, not to mention within ten minutes," he said, with a hint of hesitation.

"You think you can discuss the quota within five minutes?" Zhao Xù shook his head and directly grabbed the sleeves of his team members.

In an instant, the energy of the spatial vibration permeated, and the mysterious glow enveloped the team holding hands.

In one second, everyone disappeared.

The miracles created by the magical artifact are being showcased in front of everyone in the room, filling them with a mix of bitterness and sweetness. For those in charge of this room, it's a matter of life and death - even deciding who to send to the front lines is a daunting task.

Compared to other powers, Yangnan has already begun to consciously construct an inner layer of defenses. Meanwhile, countless people are speculating about who will get the ticket to enter the inner city.

However, this sudden and massive attack has caught everyone off guard. The entire Yangnan force has mobilized, constantly repelling the undead creatures that have breached the defense zone.

Flying in the sky, Zhao Xu gazed down at the scene unfolding below, his heart filled with anger.

Many forces that had been painstakingly gathered are now forced to take up arms and march onto the battlefield to defend their homeland. Even many of them are young and inexperienced.

The scale of this attack has prompted Yangnan to go on high alert, entering a state of total mobilization where everyone is a soldier.

"Kill one, earn one's keep! Kill two, make a profit!" a man holding a long spear shouted, his iron-tipped spear already stained with the rotting flesh of the undead. Even his face was splattered with gore.

As he thought about his family waiting behind the front lines, making emergency supplies for the battlefield, his heart swelled with courage.

Especially after his wife had just reminded him to seize this opportunity to prove himself in the new world, especially to those powerful figures.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was only after the world was destroyed that the earth's crust was able to regenerate, giving those who survived a chance to rise again. Even mothers urged their children to seize this rare opportunity for a second life.

With a fiery passion in his heart, the young man looked at his comrades behind him and shouted, "Who's with me to take down that giant undead creature in front?"

However, before his words had even fallen silent, a sword beam flashed across his face, beheading him instantly. His blood splattered everywhere.

"Commander!" someone cried out, but it was too late.

The young man's comrades, who had just witnessed his brutal murder, let out a collective wail, but it was in vain.

The skull giant, who had just taken the young man's life, raised its massive axe, ready to expand its killing spree.

"Why must you treat us like this?" the young man's teenage brother, who had just lost his brother, knelt on the ground, tears welling up in his eyes. "We've fought hard in this world of Arthur, but why won't the heavens give us a chance to live a good life?"

"We've accumulated no past experiences, but since we've crossed over, we just want to live well. Is it really so difficult?"

This outburst of anger and frustration resonated deeply with the soldiers, but they were too numb to comfort each other. All they could do was hold their shields and grit their teeth, fighting for a glimmer of hope to survive.

At this moment, everyone who saw the young man's gruesome fate longed to return home to their families.

On the border of the world of Arthur, similar scenes were happening repeatedly. These people who had recovered earliest were initially the most adaptable, but this blow had left everyone bewildered.

As morale continued to decline, the scales of victory had tipped in favor of the enemy. Even experienced commanders on the battlefield were preparing to issue orders to retreat.

Suddenly, everyone heard a heavenly melody echoing across the sky.
The distant voice echoed and drifted, with varying tones and rhythms that possessed a certain ancient, mystical aura, utterly serene.

As the syllables were pronounced simultaneously, the sound seemed mystical, and only the most perceptive wizards could barely extract a few crucial keywords from it.

Not until the very last moment did the crowd finally hear a clear voice from above—

"Legendary Spell: Dragon Tribe Assault."
