Chapter 583: What Kind of Man Are You

Anastasia's words left Zhao Xu completely bewildered.

Even if it's someone very close to him, he wouldn't dare to let someone enter his memories.

Because this means that from the past to the future, everything would be known to someone else, including something that makes him feel like his back is on fire just by thinking about it.

This is completely a natural instinctual shame.

Even if Anastasia, who is extremely good to him, wants to explore his memories, Zhao Xu will unconsciously hesitate.

But now, Anastasia is actively asking him to do something that makes him feel unable to agree.

Anastasia doesn't seem to have too much faith in him.

Without lowering his guard, Zhao Xu can not only explore Anastasia's memories but even modify and reshape his personality to the point where it's hard to distinguish him from someone else.

At this moment, Anastasia is like injecting anesthesia into Zhao Xu's face, allowing him to do whatever he wants.

"Teacher, is this really necessary?" Zhao Xu shook his head, "There are many ways to explore memories, no need to do it so recklessly."

Although it's just a matter of "exploring" memories to see if there are any signs of modification.

But "editing memories" itself is a "major surgery" level operation, and Zhao Xu can't help but be cautious.

"I've already opened up to you, so I won't hesitate anymore,"

Anastasia also seemed very candid, with a delicate face revealing an innocent smile, "In the past thousand years, I've used over a hundred methods to explore my memories."
Here is the translation:

"Even for a period of time, I deliberately went to a dimension where time flowed at a speed of one-hundredth of normal speed, and spent exactly 20 years, tirelessly recalling my entire life from birth to the age of 20, examining it like rewinding a tape."

"At the time, I had already noticed some suspicious signs, but couldn't form a concrete opinion, so I could only suspect. It wasn't until this trip to the nine circles of hell that I deepened my judgment."

"So I need you to help me sort out my memories before I became a legendary mage at the age of 20."

As soon as Anzhiya finished speaking, a buzzing sound echoed in Zhao Xu's mind.

The focus wasn't on memories, but on the legendary mage!
At the age of 20, a legendary mage!
He was still in his early years, just like a child, and had just graduated from college.

It's said that the youngest legendary mage in the mage association is not Kroel, right?

"Yes, that's true," Anzhiya said, "but there's a condition - the association was indeed established in that way, even if Silvianna was a year younger than him."

"However, I'm no longer within the scope of statistics."

As Anzhiya said this, she revealed a self-satisfied expression, "It's not that difficult to become a legendary mage, but it's difficult to maintain one's reputation and remain well-known while gradually fading away from people's minds. That's what's truly impressive."

Zhao Xu also understood that Anzhiya's existence spanned over thousands of years of the association's history, and many mages believed she was the descendant of the Itel royal family.
Here is the translation of the text:

And Anniya herself is not the type of person who can suddenly disappear without a trace. Whether she is going out or casting spells, she is always the kind of person who is loud and boisterous, and never knows how to write those four words "闷声发大财" (to make a fortune quietly).

As it stands now, she is able to rely on this ability to gradually fade away in her memories.

This ability is so powerful that even the gods who have been sealed away could be affected by it, to the point where they would lose all their followers and the opportunity to be reborn through their faith.

"When he performed this hidden spell on me, he was also trying to protect me with the passage of time. My name as a princess had already disappeared from the minds of ordinary people. Only those with a lineage spanning thousands of years could still know my name."

"But I've always suspected that he didn't just create a single barrier. I think he touched my memories back then, to prevent me from acting impulsively. He deliberately sealed away my past."

"But his spell was too powerful, even to this day. I can't even see what level he was on. Not even the legendary 'Final Scroll' created by him, which is said to be a product of his carelessness, could be understood."

As Anniya spoke, she lowered her head, not letting Zhao Xu see her expression. "And I also suspect that he set up a trigger in my memories, waiting for a certain moment to arrive when he would appear in my mind and tell me the truth."

At this point, Zhao Xu even sensed the slight tremor in Anniya's tone.

He couldn't help but comfort her, saying, "So, isn't it better to wait for that day to come?"

Zhao Xu was clear that sometimes knowing earlier is not always a good thing.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can be said that the butterfly effect caused by Zhao Xu has led to a significant boost in the overall strength of the players. However, this has also reached the capacity limit of the channel, ultimately resulting in an early crossing.

Zhao Xu has made the average player level stronger, but also reduced the overall number of players.

"'Zhong Xia'," An Ti Nuo Ya suddenly looked up, her eyes already reddened. "I have been waiting for millions of years."

As soon as she spoke, the silence was palpable.

How could she wait any longer?

Zhao Xu's mind was instantly filled with a surge of mysterious blue light, as if his vitality had been drained. The energy was then absorbed and shot directly to the apex of the dome above.

Instantly, the residents of the lower levels all looked up in wonder at the mysterious flash of light.

Suddenly, the energy hovering in mid-air suddenly condensed into a cobalt flash of lightning, illuminating the entire tower with a deep, cold arc.

This is Zhao Xu's strongest state when he unleashes the "Thousand Laws Book".

At this moment, the "Thousand Laws Book" is not like it was before, only occasionally manifesting and then disappearing. Under Zhao Xu's control, the book has triggered the final page of the spell - "Record of Memories!"

Zhao Xu's entire body is suddenly covered in countless silver threads, heading towards An Ti Nuo Ya.

Each thread seems to possess consciousness, weaving in and out like a thousand threads of frustration, slowly approaching An Ti Nuo Ya, as if trying to invade her mind.

Originally, the "Heart Barrier" protected by the "Formless Shield" was suddenly opened by An Ti Nuo Ya, and her clothes and hair were blown back by the wind. She also welcomed her own inner "Acceptance" from within."
Anniya, just like shedding all the masks of a girl, will bare herself to Zhao Xu, naked and unadorned.

"'Midsummer, if you see the memories I have of him in my mind, if you see his true self, then please ask him one thing for me."

"'What kind of man are you.'"
