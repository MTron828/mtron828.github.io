Chapter 708: Taking it Back

"Amnesia?"

How can this be happening in the year 2021? It's like a melodramatic plot from a low-budget TV drama.

As soon as Ernest lost all his memories, Zhao Xu suddenly fell into a state of confusion.

It was as if he had just reached the climax of an action movie, only to be suddenly stopped and switched to a cheap romance drama.

"I love you," he suddenly declared, "you love him, and he loves me."

"Stop joking around?" Zhao Xu silently protested.

This is an existence that can use the Eleven Rings and Twelve Rings of Magic!
He would actually forget his memories? What's the difference between that and forgetting to read a magic spell?

However, Anzinoja looked at him with a sorrowful expression. "Actually, I hope this is just a joke. Otherwise, I would have encountered the first light of life much earlier."

"Or I wouldn't have seen all the tragedies from birth to childhood."

Zhao Xu felt a faint tremor in his heart.

He had seen a small and helpless Anzinoja in her memories, and it made him want to hug her and give her warmth.

"What happened to me?"

Zhao Xu was no longer distinguishing between his "Ernest" and "Zhao Xu" identities.

He took a deep breath.

Anzinoja shook her head, "I don't know."

She looked at Zhao Xu with a helpless gaze, "You know it, I'm your inner reflection, I can understand your memories, so I'm also composed of your memories."
Here is the translation of the text:

"But after Ernest lost his memory, he came to Arthur, but before that, he didn't know what he had experienced, not even he himself could tell. I also couldn't know."

"That's a segment he can't track."

Zhao Xu shook his head.

It's a perfect dead loop.

The key is in the room, the door is locked, and you need the key to open it.

Following this, he couldn't help but fall into a state of profound confusion, even descending into a state of shock.

Or he couldn't determine anything - Ernest had lost his memory due to some unknown reason, such as defeat and escape or a magical power, and then returned to the original Arthurian world.

But the time-space node chose incorrectly, and he mistakenly went back to the era before Anny was born, thousands of years ago.

Or was the other party forced to give up this memory due to some reason?

Or was it threatened?

Or was there some kind of exchange?

Or was it a necessity?

Even if the entire world was destroyed, and he was the only one left?

So he erased all memories to avoid eternal suffering.

Zhao Xu didn't hope for that.

The lines of fate are endless, representing countless possibilities.

Like tossing a coin into the sky, two lines of fate will emerge - the heads and tails of the coin, and in some cases, a vertical line or a bird carrying the line away.

All living beings in Arthur's world made choices in this moment, creating an infinite number of lines of fate that cannot be measured in billions of miles.

This is a colossal and complex accumulation state, worthy of being called Arthur's most mysterious state.
Here is the translation:

However, they will all converge to one point.

Fate has completed its explanation.

It chose the possibility with the largest probability to execute.

Humans have also completed their own observation.

They saw the development of the world.

The fate line of Ernest, which was once Zhao Xu's most possible fate line, was even too afraid to disobey.

If he did not become a powerful wizard in this fate line and returned to the time of King Arthur, who lived a thousand years ago, then Anniya will develop according to the fate line without Ernest.

The lifespan of a half-elf is only a few hundred years.

Even immortal wizards face numerous adventures and threats from gods of death and other supernatural beings.

Whether Anniya can live to this day has become a big question.

Arthur even ceased to involve Ernest, and the development of the entire magical system may take a different direction, with the eight major factions falling apart.

As a result, today's wizards are all specialized in their own magic, and all wizards can only learn a few varieties of magic. Magic has even been lost.

All these are possible.

After all, Ernest's position in the history of magic is at least over a third of the entire book, and sometimes the history of magic is even Ernest's official autobiography.

Conservatively, Zhao Xu is afraid to know his future fate, knowing that he returned to the ancient era of King Arthur and then left to return to the correct time node.

But he will still accept this fate.

This is the helplessness of fate.
Here is the translation:

It is this kind of helplessness that makes him fearful and anxious about the choices he will face when he loses his memories, and it is also a kind of helplessness to accept.

It's as if he knows he will be hit by a car at 5:30 pm. But in the next few parallel worlds, he realizes that every time he stands at the crossroads, waiting for the cars to cross the red light, his fate becomes even more miserable. Even his family becomes more unfortunate because of this.

This repeated cycle, this endless tragic replay.

Finally, he stands silently at the designated time, quietly accepting the fate arranged by fate.

This is the greatest fear that Zhao Xu feels after Ernest loses his memory.

But Annyla smiles lightly and says, "You don't need to worry. Even if you lose your memories, you are still you, Zhong Xia, Ernest, and Zhao Xu. You will still be you, still be him."

Zhao Xu takes a deep breath from the bottom of his heart, although his whole body is under perfect control, maintaining the most stable balance state.

But he can still feel the burning sensation on his cheek, as if a furnace is burning.

Zhao Xu murmurs silently.

Silent inhalation.

As if a middle-aged man who has failed in life is sitting on the bed, looking at the future, looking at tomorrow.

He suddenly realizes that sometimes, knowing one's fate is a cruel thing.

Especially when you have confidence to change this fate but lack the courage to change it.

Zhao Xu raises his head and looks at Annyla again, "So, after Ernest crosses over, he will be in a completely unknown situation about what will happen in the future?"

Annyla nods slightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"At that time, the teacher took me as his disciple, and also took May as his follower. There were only a few of us, and we followed him closely. She smiled slightly and said, 'However, most of them were women, including the first, second, and third generations of the magical goddesses.'

"After that, we followed the teacher's will and stood up at the moment of the sunset of the gods to become new deities. The final scroll is what the teacher left for us, consisting of seven notebooks.'

"On the front page, it recorded the secrets of becoming a magical deity. Most of those who became legendary wizards in the wizarding association got to see the final scroll once and knew the truth of this world, and also took an oath to protect the magic until they died.'

"Therefore, relying on the accumulation of legendary wizards over the years, the process of becoming a deity was much simpler than in ancient times.'

"Zhao Xu silently looked at the notebooks in his backpack, almost forgotten. Ah, this meant he had to collect all seven notebooks before he left, then he could leave this world smoothly.

"On one hand, the former Arthur could also obtain the final scroll.

"On the other hand, after he left, Arthur would only have the seven notebooks of the final scroll.

"It wouldn't be like now, where the final scroll was in the tower of the floating city, and he had notebooks that hadn't become the final scroll yet.

"Thinking back to when he used the 'identification technique' to examine the notebooks in his hand, Zhao Xu felt that he was a bit foolish at the time.

"'Where did Ernest leave Arthur's world, do you know?' Zhao Xu asked with a hint of fear."

Here is the translation of the text:

As for this, Anzhi Noya, it's with a mix of joy and regret, looking at Zhao Xu Dao, "Actually, I really want to tell you, he has arrived in the world above." 

Zhao Xu Dao left Arthur immediately.

Ernest returned to Arthur immediately.

This is a storyline that connects the world above.

"This is what I begged him for when I first met him, hoping he would return well to the world after a thousand years, returning to the time node where he was truly born and existed."

"All our apostles have sworn an oath to him, promising to secretly maintain their strength and wait for his return."

"But did Ernest refuse?"

Zhao Xu Dao asked.

The future him, so full of determination?

It's so obvious that he wouldn't take the stable path?
He gave up many means, such as becoming the master of the abyss, abandoning the magic empire he had founded, all because he would leave ancient Arthur.

After returning to the timeline where he belonged, he would no longer be rejected by the timeline, and he could calmly be the king of the mountain in Arthur's era.

Mastering the abyss is equivalent to having a complete building, and mastering the eleven-ring and twelve-ring magic arts is equivalent to having complete technology, with any enemy being easy to defeat.

Even the Lord of the Nine Jails would be swept away like trash in history.

Unless Arthur's gods could find the legendary "God of Gods" mentioned in the legend, which is the way of the gods.

Otherwise, Arthur has already slipped halfway into Ernest's pants.
Here is the translation:

Anzhen said, "Although the teacher has lost his memory, that kind of intuition from magic has allowed him to sense the crucial information, which made him decide to return to the original terrifying world to find his lost memories and find the lost things."

Huh?

This?

Zhao Xu almost forgot to close his mouth.

Memory, ordinary people losing it, that's really forgetting.

Who can reverse it?

Almost like King Arthur's magic equivalent, Ernest, finding it's not a big problem.

Wait until I leave this world, then you can come back and read everyone's memories, slowly piecing together some things?

Except for the unknown part of the terrifying world, it's really hard to find back.

Like Anzhen, who has known Zhao Xu for thousands of years, they can just chat freely.

Even Anzhen has a memory of being with Zhao Xu, which can be seamlessly connected.

Even he suspects that this place in front of him is Ernest's precautionary measure.

But...

Zhao Xu sighed.

But if he accepts this imperfect plan, he's not the Ernest who once suppressed the entire Arthur, making even the gods unable to lift their heads.

The place he's going to is not even worthy of being described as a dragon's lair.

That world filled with an indescribable terror, Zhao Xu was just tossed around by the dream of that representative of chaos, Niyarathotep.

No, chaos.

Zhao Xu's memory has stalled.

Although each celestial body has its own "chaos", and the level of terror in that world is even stronger.

Those rumored gods, each one looks like they have the power to crush the strongest gods in Arthur's world.

But compared to...

As the "chaos" of the "one of the three giant dragons of creation" in Arthur, and Niyarathotep, the "chaos", isn't that a conflict?

God, Lirien.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu seemed to recall something.

Is he also the embodiment of that Nyarlathotep?

If so, he might as well kill himself to avoid the disgust.

Thinking about the rumors that this person has a similar appearance to a demon, Zhao Xu felt a chill run down his spine.

However, thinking about it, since Ernest wants to go back to that terrifying world and retrieve some things, this possibility is unlikely.

The key question now is: what happened after Ernest went back to that terrifying world all those years ago and fought.

Unfortunately, it's a pity.

Ah?

Zhao Xu suddenly had an epiphany and recalled the time Ernest descended upon them, and the sigh he let out at that moment!

Unfortunately, they did not meet in the real world.

Looking at Anzhenya's calm face, Zhao Xu silently lowered his head and gazed at the ground, not daring to lift his eyes.

It was as if he couldn't bear to look at this beautiful person.

"Anzhenya."

"Hmm?" Anzhenya slightly tilted her head and leaned in to listen.

At this moment, Zhao Xu called out his mentor's name for the first time.

He believed it would be the beginning of everything in the future.

"I think you know, Ernest, that besides memories, he must go back to retrieve something."

Anzhenya smiled slightly.

"Yes, I know."

"He wants to go back and retrieve his memories."

"Maybe it's the love of a lifetime."

(Note: Nyarlathotep is a fictional character from H.P. Lovecraft's works, and the story seems to be inspired by his mythos.)
