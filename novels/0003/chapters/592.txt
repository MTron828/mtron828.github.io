Chapter 593: The Collapse of the Future

Zhao Xu suddenly noticed that the grass plants that had been thriving at his feet had lost their vitality and withered away, as if they had completed their life cycle in a matter of seconds. These plants, which had grown in a desolate land and were known for their resilience, were now withering away. This meant that a stronger, undead creature was invading, rapidly draining the remaining life force from this land!

Level 17 Demon Queen!

Zhao Xu's mind flashed with the image of a creature that could bring death with its song.

As it turned out, the Demon Queen possessed the special ability to suppress plant growth, affecting the growth of plants within a one-kilometer radius.

The Demon Queen was, in essence, the soul of a race of people who had died from extreme selfishness and strong willpower. They hated all living beings and took pleasure in killing them.

"Run!" Zhao Xu shouted to the nearby border guards.

However, the moat that had been used to block the enemy had become a trap that hindered the retreat, significantly slowing down the group's withdrawal. Despite the chaos and confusion, the group had to retreat slowly.

The fiery air above suddenly became eerily quiet, as if the sound of hearing had been lost. Zhao Xu's internal alarm remained unchanged, and he quietly recalled the details of the Demon Queen, a powerful undead creature.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Scream of the Female Demon" is renowned even in the nine realms, and this divine technique can cause those who hear its sharp sound to die instantly. This technique is derived from the "Female Demon", a terrifying undead creature.

These creatures, like ghosts, possess the ability to induce "fearful appearance", which can cause ordinary people who dare to look directly at them to lose 1-4 points of strength, agility, and vitality attributes permanently.

What's even more terrifying is that the Female Demon can unleash its "Scream" ability three times a day, killing all living beings within a 10-meter radius or a 20-meter conical area.

It is also due to the Female Demon's ability to suppress growth and its scream ability that the area where it appears becomes barren, like a ruin. This is the reason behind the legend that when a place suddenly withers away, it forebodes death.

As Zhao Xu's momentary lapse, a female figure with a grotesque appearance, pointed ears, and a messy yellow hair, hovering in the air, suddenly appeared before Zhao Xu's eyes.

At this moment, her mouth was open, revealing her sharp fangs and red tongue, and a piercing "Death Wave" sound, like an air cannon, exploded!

"The Scream of the Female Demon!"

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your four-ring "Immortality Seal" technique is activated, making you immune to all death spells, magical death effects, energy absorption, and other negative energy effects. You are immune to the Female Demon's "Scream" effect.】

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your three-ring "Energy Shield" technique is activated, making you immune to fatigue, exhaustion, and property damage. You are also immune to the Female Demon's "Fearful Appearance" effect.】
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, the deathly aura swept over Zhao Xu's face, but the instant-death force was blocked by Zhao Xu's skin, and a flash of yellow light flickered before disappearing.

His "immunity" had been resisted.

Two to three rings of magic, although minute-level, had created a massive gap between Zhao Xu and these undead beings.

Even ordinary players of the same level might fall at any moment, unable to withstand the pressure.

This was the reason why a team needed a healer. Only with a healer could the team's tolerance be increased.

It was not possible for anyone to solo fight from start to finish like Zhao Xu.

At this moment, several militia members who were about seven to eight steps away from Zhao Xu and had not yet fully escaped, although facing away from the female demon and unaware of Zhao Xu's appearance, were directly knocked to the ground by the all-around death cry. They had no chance of surviving the demon's cry.

Zhao Xu also felt a numbness in his back and turned around to see that three more "female demons" had surrounded him, attacking him simultaneously.

If he were to be hit and had no immunity, he would directly lose 1-4 points of charm attribute.

This wave of undead attack was like an unstoppable tide, and Zhao Xu was immediately surrounded by a group of tiny, worm-like, scale-covered creatures with multiple faces, charging towards him.

Zhao Xu never fought without a guarantee and did not recognize these undead beings, and therefore would not take rash action.

Zhao Xu immediately retreated backwards, creating distance, and cast a spell to separate himself from the battlefield, which would be disastrous for him if he were surrounded and attacked again.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The resplendent light."

Facing this urgent moment, Zhao Xu immediately cast a five-ring spell targeting undead beings and combined it with the "Spell Extension" talent of his potential points.

Just as he finished the gesture, he revealed an even more ruthless gaze and added a few more talents - Spell Twin, Spell Amplification, and Spell Prolongation!

The spell energy of the resplendent light burst forth instantly within a 40-meter radius around Zhao Xu, radiating a dazzling brilliance like a sparkling flame.

Unavoidable and unstoppable, the positive energy spread continuously, illuminating every corner of the area like the "Daylight" spell.

In this instant, all undead beings in the area were unable to avoid being affected by the "Dizziness" state, unable to see the road ahead, and simultaneously, each undead being within a 40-meter radius of Zhao Xu would suffer 12 (1D6 Twin Amplification) points of damage.

Moreover, this is a fixed-distance spell, allowing Zhao Xu to maintain it for a long time.

In other words, within a 24-hour period, any undead being within a 40-meter radius of Zhao Xu would be disoriented and injured, and the already fragile skeletons would collapse and scatter their bones.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also used his "Religious Knowledge" to search for information on a type of "Worm of Wrath" known as "Ensnared Soul".

A super-small undead being formed by the wrathful soul of one who cannot achieve their wishes.

Once attached to the other side, it would become a chosen one, becoming a parasitic relationship.
Here is the translation of the text:

From this moment on, the vengeful soul will entangle itself around the target organism's neck or lean against its chest. Then, the vengeful soul will rely on the host to take action, assembling a group of demonic creatures completely controlled by it.

This feeling of revulsion is unbearable, causing Zhao Xun to have no desire to be touched by these worms.

Fortunately, the "Radiant Light" also blocked the "Fearful Binding Spirit" and the "Ghost" that followed.

These floating, immortal beings can be described as the frontline troops of the Undead Legion, specialized in clearing out the strong opponents of the Undead.

Even if the player has a revival stone and faces this level of Undead, they can only avoid its attacks.

Not to mention, a high-level adventure team that has completed many "Glory Poems" would retreat in fear at the sight of this scale of Undead.

Single-handedly, a female demon can slaughter a 10th-level adventurer team in Arthur's territory.

Zhao Xun noticed that even with the Light Rain Barrier, the number of Undead below continued to increase, and even using his life to pave the way, they came rushing towards him, sighing and then quietly opening a "Safeguard Door" to create a safe distance.

Compared to the first time he encountered the Ghost, Zhao Xun was even forced to use the "Prayer Candle" to barely resist the situation.

Now, Zhao Xun has reached a level of nonchalance when encountering these Undead.

However, Zhao Xun's inner self is more aware of the severity of the situation.

If the Earth humans of the previous era had encountered an attack of this scale, they would have long since perished in the wilderness.

This scale is too excessive, not to mention attacking the cities of Arthur's territory.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even the capital city of the Northern Alliance would find it difficult to withstand such a level of assault. Zhao Xū also couldn't bother to conceal his identity, and directly controlled his flight ability, soaring to the sky.

In an instant, he looked out and saw that in the distance, numbering in the tens of kilometers, there were countless undead soldier legions, densely packed like a plague of locusts.

It seemed that from the moment of their rebirth, all the deceased bodies had transformed into undead creatures and appeared here.

"I want to see the future of Yǎnán!"
With a heart full of foreboding, Zhao Xū directly waved his staff and cast the "Ominous Omen" spell.

After a brief prayer, the power of fate extracted an image of the future and slowly displayed to Zhao Xū the dangers he might face.

The spell evaluated the current environment and all possible roads, and based on this, it revealed to the caster a glimpse of the future, showing the fate of the next hour.

Just then, Zhao Xū, who had been maintaining a calm demeanor, suddenly changed color.

Logically, he should have seen the result of himself defending this region for an hour, but the scene flashing through his mind was instead "Yǎnán being overwhelmed".

The innocent civilians who had struggled to reach Yǎnán were being devoured by undead creatures, their bodies half-eaten, with the stench of death emanating from them. The undead creatures were excitedly jumping and selecting their new food sources.

The Night Shadow flew over the high-altitude association in the core of Yǎnán, and below it, the city was ablaze, with countless people choosing to set themselves on fire rather than be transformed into undead creatures.
