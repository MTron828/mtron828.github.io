Chapter 397: Choosing a Master
Zhao Xu turned her attention to Wei Wei and nodded her head, pulling out a gold coin from her bosom and placing it in the palm of the two players.

"This is your reward," Wei Wei said in a clear and cold voice.

After saying that, she raised her hand again, holding the sacred avenger, and flew towards Zhao Xu in front of her.

Her target had now changed to helping Zhao Xu obtain the few bronze treasure boxes.

"Brother, can we still keep up?" Lin Ke, the player, asked with a tangled expression.

Looking around the entire nest, Zhao Xu saw that it was filled with countless mutant scorpions, some of which had already reached the limit of capacity and were stacked on top of each other.

These mutant scorpions seemed to have received some mysterious instruction, and they had crawled from the countless tunnels of this labyrinth to the central nest.

If Zhao Xu and Wei Wei didn't have the ability to fly, it would take them more than half an hour to squeeze through the scorpions' escape hole.

"We'll retreat from another entrance," said the warrior, North Country, looking at the gold coins in his handbag, which contained at least 50 gold coins, enough for their tonight's gains.

"Just what?" Lin Ke asked, looking at Zhao Xu, who was about to launch a fierce attack at the entrance of the cave.

"Can't we follow them?" Lin Ke said, his eyes flashing with admiration.

"We can't, no matter how much we want to," North Country said with a solemn expression. "We players can't follow the NPCs. If we do, we'll be looked down upon."

"One day, our players, including the mage, will be as powerful as this NPC mage."

North Country's eyes seemed to ignite with a fiery glow.

As for Zhao X큰 at this moment, he is wildly swinging his wooden staff, unfazed by the monsters around him. With his fearless, fierce, and magical abilities, he can deal double the damage to his enemies. However, he is not using his scroll abilities at the moment, conserving his spell slots. Instead, he is relying on his fearless and fierce abilities to deal massive damage, reaching as high as 60 HP in a single blow. He is moving at incredible speed, his body a blur as he charges forward like a steel warrior.

As he fights, the variant scorpions in the cave begin to gather, drawn to the commotion. Despite their ferocity, they are no match for Zhao X큰, who can take them down with ease. Even the most powerful warriors would find it difficult to comprehend how this seemingly ordinary man, with his unassuming staff and average speed, can take down the variant scorpions with such ease.

It is rare to find a warrior like Zhao X큰, who can deal triple or even quadruple the damage with each attack. Even legendary warriors can only achieve a mere double or quadruple the damage, with the exception of mythical heroes wielding the legendary scythe. But Zhao X큰, with his incredible abilities, is akin to a demigod, turning the world of heroes into a "True Hero Unrivaled".

Even if Zhao Xu triggers a critical hit, he can still deal an additional 200% damage, reaching a maximum of 500% damage.

"I'm here," said Vivian as she charged towards the sea of flying scorpions in the sky.

Her body was already covered in the sticky liquid from the slain insects and was no different from Zhao Xu's.

Zhao Xu looked around and saw that the small variant scorpions were still emerging from the ground, one after another, and quickly wrapped themselves around his leg.

The speed at which they emerged was far beyond the speed at which the two of them were killing each other.

Even if Zhao Xu activated his "Sword Cloud" freely and slashed at the scorpions, it was of no use.

Some of the scorpions that attacked Zhao Xu managed to hit his weak points, successfully breaking through his mage armor and causing damage.

It was only until Zhao Xu's star cloak emitted a radiant light that he was finally able to block the attack.

"Enter the cave," Zhao Xu shouted.

Confirming that he had obtained the bronze chest and picked it up, his target had already changed, no longer just seeking to fight to the death to gain life energy.

As Zhao Xu's figure entered the dark and winding tunnel, he suddenly discovered that the air was thick with the stench of insects, with scorpions piled high in every corner of the tunnel.

Anyone with an entomophobia would have fainted at the sight.

It was only in such a harsh environment that Vivian, who was born and raised in the depths of the underworld, could have followed Zhao Xu without any concern, killing her way through.

From then on, Zhao Xu triggered his sword energy with each round, charging forward with each attack.

At the same time, he used his wooden club to bludgeon each scorpion that blocked his path, until the entire tunnel was filled with the stench of death.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also discovered for the first time that mechanical repetition of hacking was not only possible when he was not in a machine-like state, but also capable of causing numbness in his hands.

As he progressed, he suddenly caught up with the speed of the mutated scorpion's advance and successfully obtained the second golden copper treasure box.

With a forced boost of morale, he continued to charge forward towards the end of the tunnel.

"What is this, not working out?" he asked.

Vivi nodded slightly, shaking off the sweat on her hair.

It was unknown why the earth's pulse was emitting heat in this winter season, much higher than before, causing them to sweat profusely.

"Ah," he sighed, feeling the numbness in his hands, which would soon turn into a stabbing sensation.

"This position, releasing a fireball technique might not clear much either."

The 6-meter fireball technique could only clear a 12-meter tunnel, and the entire circular area was almost a waste.

"Don't rush."

Zhao Xu consoled, gasping for breath, one hand against the wall, the other supporting his knee, with his hands sticky with insect fragments.

Other mages would not learn the same spell multiple times, as they would choose their skills carefully. It was too expensive to copy spells, with a rental fee of 50 gold coins per page, and three-ring spells requiring three pages, which would cost 150 gold coins to copy. Not to mention the cost of ink waste.

Because he had initially invested too many spell slots in close combat, even if he could combine two two-ring spells to make a three-ring spell, he was still struggling.

This made him extremely eager to reach level 9 when he finally did.
Here is the translation of the text:

While the 9th-level mage had the ability to allocate unlimited spell slots, his combat power was 1000. Even if he faced a 9th-level wizard, he had the confidence to take him on. Instantly, the originally cleared path in the tunnel, which Zhao Xuqing had created by moving some space, was suddenly filled with countless small, densely packed variant scorpions that appeared in front of him. Those giant variant scorpions that had sensed the terrifying threat of Zhao Xuqing's wooden staff charging towards them began to flee. At the same time, countless small variant scorpions continuously piled up to form a wall to block his forward route.

Zhao Xuqing, although he had killed his way to a point where he felt his energy was almost depleted, was currently exhausted and completely drained. The variant scorpions around him were rushing towards him in a frenzy, trying to claw and tail-stab him. He was barely able to hold them off with his shield and star cloak.

"Commander, fall back a bit," Vi Vi'an whispered at this time. Her secret silver armor, which had previously been weak in some joints, had appeared to be damaged and was successfully attacking her. However, the damage was slight, and she quickly healed herself with her sacred warrior's self-healing ability.

On the other hand, Zhao Xuqing, a mage born with healing magic, had not once used his healing spell in the past four months. In contrast to the ordinary mage's spell slots, which were mostly consumed by healing spells. "No need," Zhao Xuqing said, gazing at his spell slots and gritting his teeth as he looked at the massive army of variant scorpions looming before him.

"I'll clear the road and then we'll rush over quickly. We can't afford to waste any more time here," Zhao Xuqing instructed.
He didn't expect that this subterranean lair of the mutated scorpion queen would be able to produce such a massive army of scorpions to block their path. "Good." Vivian emphasized with a nod.

Suddenly, the sand on Zhao Xu's head suddenly cracked open, and a swarm of super small and small mutated scorpions directly fell onto his body. They enveloped him like a curtain, swelling and convulsing on his body.

Vivian's eyes widened in an instant, and she hastily raised her long sword, but was unable to wield it. She was clear that Zhao Xu was fine for now, but if the opponent lost consciousness or fell into a helpless state, the swarm of mutated scorpions in front of her could easily kill him.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, looked like an old man who had lost all his strength, struggling to lift his arm that was already covered with many scorpions. His middle finger managed to push through the swarm of scorpions surrounding him and pointed forward, indicating the already blocked tunnel.

"Flash of lightning."

The tip of his finger burst with electric light, and a blue electric arc descended from the sky, passing through the two realms.

A long whip-like flash of lightning, nearly 40 meters long, struck the void and reached the other side.

All the gold, silver, and copper in the surrounding rocks melted instantly, and all obstacles were shattered to pieces.

The tunnel that was previously impermeable to the wind was suddenly cleared, revealing a 40-meter-long path.

The mutated scorpions, which were still alive just moments ago, died en masse in the flash of lightning's 10-60 damage range (10D6). They had lost all ability to struggle and became corpses, leaving behind only scorch marks from the lightning.

"Fly."

Zhao Xu charged forward with a burst of speed.
Here is the translation of the text:

The next congested road ahead was yet another "thunderbolt" that pierced through the dark tunnel, illuminating the entire path.

Until the very end, Zhao Xu charged forward with all his might.

The moonlight faintly shone on his exhausted but resolute face.

Dew condensed into frost, dripping onto his outer robe that had already absorbed the venomous liquid of the mutated scorpions.

He absolutely couldn't shake off this feeling of disgust.

At this moment, Ve Ve held up her long sword under the moonlight, blocking his way.

She gazed at the cavalry approaching from the front, as if facing death itself.

Before them lay a slope, where a heavy-armed cavalry team was stationed, led by two identical-looking young men.

Surrounding them were giant, super-giant, and even super-super-giant mutated scorpions, occupying the entire mountain peak.

As the leading scorpions bowed their heads and knees towards the two young men, Zhao Xu immediately understood that this underground lair belonged to someone.

This meant that the treasure box he had obtained was placed by the powerful family behind the two young men.

"You dare to take and occupy the treasure box placed by our family here?" one of the young men with a pale face and a hint of arrogance shouted angrily. "You two thieves, hand it back to us!"

"Not necessary, kill them and take it from their corpses," the other young man with a stern face said. "They have already touched the family secret and can only be killed."

He waved his hand, and suddenly, the cavalry from all directions rushed towards them.
