Chapter 157: Ancient Secret

Zhao Xu's protective staff suddenly burst with a blinding light, shooting straight towards the massive fire elemental.

The massive fire elemental, which had previously looked down on Zhao Xu, felt a sense of unease as it sensed the unknown implications of the spell. It desperately tried to dodge to the side to avoid the attack.

However, "Expulsion Spell" is a spell that doesn't require aiming, and as long as it's within a 10-meter casting distance, it's a guaranteed hit. Moreover, the spell's effectiveness can even increase with the caster's level.

The fire elemental didn't take the spell's energy impact seriously at first. It had seen such desecration of nature's laws before, and many spells were derived from the abilities of powerful creatures.

However, in the instant the spell's energy exploded, the fire elemental's eyes widened in disbelief. It summoned all its willpower to try to resist the powerful expulsion force from the other side.

But it was facing a level 20 staff wielded by a level 20 mage, equivalent to a mage releasing this spell. The power was incomparable.

"Not possible. How can wizards do this now——"

The massive fire elemental's voice grew quieter as its body, composed entirely of fierce flames, slowly shrank and eventually extinguished, disappearing into a small flame.

From where it came, it would return to where it went.

This was a four-level divine spell and a five-level arcane spell, known as the Expulsion Spell.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia triggered the "Expulsion Spell", and the massive fire elemental's willpower failed, having been expelled.】
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's staff, which has a 20th-level spellcaster level, surpasses the life die of the fire element by 4 points, directly adding this 4-point advantage to his spellcasting difficulty. The fire element's will is not an advantage dodge, and it cannot resist, resulting in being driven away.

This is also a problem that all extraterrestrial beings will face.

No matter how strong they are, they will have a possibility of being directly expelled when facing a spellcaster like Zhao Xu who has expulsion and banishment spells.

The priest who had summoned the fire element with all his might stared at Zhao Xu, who had just destroyed the elemental with a single blow and sent it into a state of stupor.

He couldn't understand what had happened in the process.

It was as if the man before him was a demon.

With a wave of his hand, Zhao Xu had solved the elemental that had taken countless sacrifices to summon.

The priest's original inner conviction began to waver.

He looked at Zhao Xu, about to ask how he had done it, but the fourth wave of pain from the "Pain Law" inside him had not stopped, and another burst of pain struck him.

It was as if someone was stabbing him with a sharp blade, and the pain was so intense that he fainted.

Zhao Xu stood at a distance, watching the priest who had fallen to the ground, slowly walking towards him.

The opponent was now below zero health points, but had not yet reached the point of true death at -10 HP.

Zhao Xu had already lost interest and was just standing there, quietly counting down the time.

He waited for a full minute before approaching to observe the opponent's condition and confirm whether he was truly dead.
As a benevolent priest, he couldn't bring himself to use the "observing life and death" technique, which could detect whether the surrounding living beings were dead or not, because this technique belonged to an evil nature. This was also the reason why Zhao Xu initially wanted to remain neutral, but later he couldn't help it. However, after he became a scroll scholar, he could freely use benevolent or evil techniques without any qualms, but the observing life and death technique was a low-level technique, and Zhao Xu still decided to spare it, choosing to check it himself.

However, just as Zhao Xu took two steps forward, he discovered that the sacrificial body suddenly ignited and burst into flames, with fierce flames soaring into the sky. Seeing the unprecedented intensity of the flames, Zhao Xu immediately realized that there was supernatural intervention.

The worship of the fire god, after death, would be wrapped in flames, and even transform into a fire element. It was likely that this was the reason why the sacrificial priest was willing to sacrifice his life to offer up the spirits. Zhao Xu sighed, gazing at the land drenched in blood.

In his days as a law enforcement officer, Arthur had rarely seen such daring evil rituals. Any cases that arose were always massive and would involve the intervention of high-ranking adventurers. As a result, Zhao Xu had never heard of the true names of various demon kings or evil gods.

Slowly, after the sacrificial soul was taken away, the flames on the opponent's body also began to decrease. Zhao Xu remained vigilant throughout, prepared for any sudden changes. Seeing no anomalies, Zhao Xu finally exhaled, but he felt that he had been here for a long time, so he directly walked past the opponent's body to stand in front of the stone monument.
Here is the translation of the text:

The towering Morlin stele stood before him, Zhao Xu tried to reach out and touch the intricate carvings on its surface, feeling a coldness emanating from it that was in stark contrast to the scorching hot environment around him. It was as if this stele was from another dimension.

Why did the ritualist choose to drive the villagers away to this place, and what was the connection between this stele and the ritual? Zhao Xu knew that in ancient times, many places would perform sacrifices to gods and spirits using such primitive methods. However, with the advent of the era of standardized gods and the prohibition of such rituals, this primitive method of sacrifice was only seen in remote ancient tribes or evil spirits.

Zhao Xu looked at the stele with a puzzled expression. The stele he encountered in the enigmatic forest at least had some mysterious symbols that could be identified through knowledge. But this stele was completely blank.

Was it supposed to be activated with a password? He thought to himself, "Ah, wouldn't it be great if I could shout 'Anshen' and have it recognize me?" But this stele seemed to require something more.

Just then, the ritualist summoned a "Anto Deus" - a level 7 large-scale fire elemental. On top of that, there were three levels: giant, elder, and king. Placed in the fire elemental position, it was like a small brother, and it was only summoned here because it was a relic from the ancient era and not yet strong enough to show its strength.

Zhao Xu looked down on the fire elemental, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at its strength. If he were to summon it in the future, it would require a "Level 7 Summoned Monster" as compensation. This meant that the ritualist had just used a level 7 arcane ability with his own blood. This was a power that only a 13-level mage could wield.
Here is the translation of the text:

Besides being related to the offerings, it's definitely also related to this stele. Could it be the true name?

Zhao Xu gazed at the stele, and began to reminisce about the era of darkness, the true name of the elemental gods.

Most records of the era of darkness have been lost in the annals of history, and the gods are not willing to let the elemental gods revive, so this segment of history has always been shrouded in secrecy.

Zhao Xu had also read the book "The Path of Arcana" written by An Ti Nuo Ya, and had read related materials during his studies of knowledge (religion) and knowledge (plane). As a result, he had caught a glimpse of some clues.

"Merselinn." Zhao Xu muttered to himself, his voice filled with doubt.

He didn't know the true name of the elemental gods, but he knew that "Merselinn" was a name with profound significance for the fire elemental plane.

Even this name appeared in some related spells.

Suddenly, the entire stele began to shake.

The originally cool and icy feeling of the stele deepened, becoming hot and burning, as if the entire stele had been suddenly heated.

Zhao Xu took a step back in surprise.

Slowly, a pair of eyes filled with fiery sparks appeared on the stele, accompanied by a faint outline.

"Who is it that summons us here?" the eyes seemed to say.

Zhao Xu gazed at the outline on the stele, lost in thought.

At this moment, An Ti Nuo Ya's name was stuck in his throat, ready to be spoken.

"Time traveler, you just killed my people?" Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise, realizing that the other party had seen through his true identity.

But he soon reacted, realizing that the other party was referring to the priest.
Here is the translation of the text:

Indeed, in this ancient era, the gods were still able to clearly perceive the status of each priest who performed sacrifices.

Therefore, killing a priest would always come with a huge price to pay.

"I'd like to ask, what's written on the stele?" Zhao Xuduan was certain he could leave at any moment, and so he calmed down and asked.

"This is not your time, leave now!" The projection on the stele seemed to be annoyed and shouted at Zhao Xuduan.

Suddenly, flames filled the air, sweeping towards Zhao Xuduan.

The intense heat and high temperature of the flames spread out like a celestial storm, bombarding the land like a storm of stars, consuming everything.

"Secondary Quick Release!"

As the moment of crisis approached, a thought flashed through Zhao Xuduan's mind, and he directly cast the spell.

The flames in the sky suddenly became like a frame-by-frame animation, slowing down significantly.

Before Zhao Xuduan finished his brief movement, even if the flames were just a few inches away from him, they still couldn't cause him any harm.

Before time ran out, he was invincible.

Zhao Xuduan looked at the stele, which was already enveloped in flames and unclear, and shook his head softly and whispered, "Anshinoia!"
