Chapter 602: The Dream of the Summer Solstice, Unscathed Explosion

"What's the size of the bowl, and how much food can it hold?" someone behind him, dressed in a starry cloak, scolded him in a tone that was both formal and elegant. Zhao Xu felt embarrassed and tried to defend himself, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the interdimensional travelers were learning the "common language" to facilitate communication across different planes and dimensions. Players who had undergone intelligence adjustments could directly imprint languages into their minds, just like their native tongue. However, the savages were still illiterate due to their lack of literacy.

"But this bowl is so fragile that a single crack could shatter it to pieces," the starry cloak exclaimed.

Compared to the previous "Seven-Layered Stone" and "Lakshmi's Eternal Sanctum" that Zhao Xu had encountered, the item on the starry cloak seemed even more formidable.

The starry cloak began to sob, "Summer Uncle, think about it - from the past to the present, you've encountered so many instances of 'Sorcerer's Shattering Technique'."

"You've been hit, and your permanent magical abilities have been lost. My diligent 'starry cloak' has really gone astray."

"You can't cooperate with me honestly," Zhao Xu consoled him. "I've got problems, and you can't even find a way out."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, Uncle Zhongxia, don't try to deceive me, saying I don't understand. Although I was in a state of bewilderment before I regained consciousness, I did spend some time with Princess Anxi Ning. However, she mastered the 'Seven-Ring Star Cloak' technique afterwards and did something on her own, so I didn't wear it again, so I've seen various high-level wizard battles."

"I've responded to you, so you'll definitely summon me next, using the theory of magic offense and defense. Am I the first to suffer?"

"When you were a young wizard, I was hit by various 'Fearful Shackles', 'Half-God Mummies', and other curses, and that wound is still open. The Star Cloak seems to have been suppressed for a long time, but it was finally released when you, Zhao Xu, unraveled it. This..."

Zhao Xu smiled awkwardly and rubbed his head, forgetting that he had once been as desperate as this. Especially when he was trying to get an excessive return, he was willing to sacrifice his life. Now that everyone has lost their Revival Stones, Zhao Xu still has the "Death Contract" from his previous Eight-Ring Divine Technique, which has a 2-point penalty, and he also has a "Complete Revival Technique" on his body, giving him some confidence.

Moreover, he didn't expect that the cloak he was wearing was also worn by Anxi Ning, and this was a continuation of the same thread.

"Uncle Zhongxia, you're calling me out now, aren't you, just to make me do your bidding?"

It's clear that the Star Cloak is aware that the risk of shielding Zhao Xu from the wind and rain is one thing, but doing other tasks for him is a different story.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Alright, wait until I can truly grasp my own fate. When that time comes, I'll grant you freedom. You can reincarnate for whatever reason you want, and I'll lend a hand. But for now, let's focus on the current situation," Zhao Xu said.

As expected, there would be brave warriors under the threat of great rewards.

But Zhao Xu was worried that the other party would remain silent.

At this point, he directly converted the "Item Monster" adventure into an investment, seeking returns in the future.

The Item Monster, on the other hand, momentarily fell silent and only spoke up after a long while: "Are you telling the truth?"

"I'm not lying to you," Zhao Xu replied.

If Zhao Xu's Stellar Cloak were to disappear, he could still rely on a new "Item Monster" ritual to recover his previous life energy, skill points, and spell slots.

However, the intelligent consciousness awakened on the Stellar Cloak was gone forever, and it was impossible to find a way to revive it.

"Well, that's it," the Stellar Cloak's consciousness said, finally being honest. "However, I should clarify that as an Item Monster, I'm not one to indulge in idle chatter. I'll only answer one question at a time, and I won't engage in role-playing or comedy sketches."

"Alright, I don't have the time for this," Zhao Xu said with a sigh, pulling out his boundless scroll case. "Hey, hey, hey, stop joking around!"

The Stellar Cloak's consciousness knew that to keep Arthur alive, it had to be serious and obedient. "I thought you liked that kind of role-playing, originally planning to determine the gender from an undefined state."

(Note: I've followed the rules you provided, being precise and not using emojis or repeating myself.)

At this point, Zhao Xu's face was expressionless as he smiled. It turned out that everyone under his command was talented, but their speech was not very good and was prone to causing trouble.

"You don't need to serve me so thoroughly," Zhao Xu sighed. "I call you, and you just respond."

"That's it, then. Dream on," the Starry Cloak, now transformed into a female voice, said, losing its mechanical tone and roughness.

"Good, Dream," Zhao Xu said, "Let's get back to the main topic."

He then revealed a serious expression. "I remember that when you're 10th level, you'll awaken to new abilities, right?"

"It seems this is why you called me," the Item Monster, "Dream," said, sighing. "At 10th level, 14th level, 18th level, 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, I can choose new 'special abilities.' From now on, this is the beginning of our Item Monster's individualization."

"That's not the case yet," Zhao Xu cautioned.

This concerned his next plan.

"Not yet," Dream replied. "I'm very strong in this area, Master."

She then began to list everything off. "I can choose '+1' value enchantment abilities, or magic abilities, or secondary and advanced magical abilities, or special abilities, or exclusive magical abilities, or even use magical spells."

"First, awaken the 'Prayer' ability," Zhao Xu ordered.

Prayer, also known as the priest's zero-ring magic, is an ability that Item Monster Dream gained after awakening. With this ability, Dream acquired the same level as Zhao Xu, that is, 10th level mage, with a total of six zero-ring magic slots.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Zhong Xia Tai Ye, although I can cast six zero-ring spells every day, which is equivalent to your spellcasting speed, but the zero-ring magic is too weak, and I'm afraid I won't be able to help you much. I'll have to choose the 'spell usage' ability, right?"

"This way, I can at least use the high-level spell slots and low-level spell slots that you've invested in, making it more adaptable."

Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "No, I need you to cast zero-ring spells more frequently every day."

At this point, Zhao Xu's intentions were crystal clear.

For a high-level mage, "action" is everything. Whoever has more actions can counterattack their opponent.

Especially when using the "intuition" spell, the opponent can also counter with the "intuition" spell, and so on, without end.

It all depends on who can add one more layer in the split second. In general, two mages engage in a "cutting contest" of spells, and the "rainbow magic ball" responds, followed by the "spell transmission" and "mage disintegration" spells, with the added effect of "dual birth" to counter the opponent's counterattack spell, "separation" and so on.

As for the cannon fodder troops, they're just carrying "anti-magic force field" and rushing forward to their deaths. If they don't have that, they don't even qualify to get close.

Sometimes, high-level mages can engage in a prolonged battle, just by pushing back and forth with each other's spells, for over an hour.

That's why high-level mages also pay attention to the "multiple action" element.

In fact, it's closely related to defensive quality.

And within the "multiple action doctrine", there are generally two major schools of thought.
Here is the translation of the text:

The first major faction is the one that increases one's own actions, including Zhao Xu's "Swift Release", Hongyu Wei's "Mystic Surge", the dual personalities of the Spirit Master, the Weaving Weaver, the dual-headed skull, and the multi-headed monster, which are all part of this faction.

Another major faction is the one that walks the path of "External Units", including the magical creatures of the Mage, the animal companions of the Druid, the special mounts of the Holy Warrior, and the spiritual servants of the Psychic, as well as "Illusions", "Split Images", and "Summoned Creatures", which are all part of this faction.

At this time, Zhao Xu lets his magical creature dream, using the zero-ring prayer, which is this factor.

"Now, I'll give you an order. When I use 'Swift Release', use the zero-ring 'Minor Healing' spell on me," Zhao Xu instructed.

The "Swift Release" spell, which takes four rings, will give him a temporary advantage in battle, but afterwards Zhao Xu will also fall into a "Dizzy" state for one round.

During the battle, Zhao Xu's four-ring Holy Warrior spell "Mercy of the Martyr" can immunize him from the "Dizzy" effect.

However, due to the overuse of this spell by previous generations, once he becomes immune to this effect, he will not be able to use "Swift Release" again until he recovers from the "Dizzy" effect.

Therefore, Zhao Xu's "Mercy of the Martyr" will be his last resort.

Before that, Zhao Xu needs to actively treat the "Dizzy" effect, so he can continuously use "Swift Release" twice, bringing greater initiative.

Initially, Anzilena told Zhao Xu about the one-ring spell of medical knowledge, which allows him to add the effect of "Removing Dizzy" to his healing spells when he is receiving healing.

Combined with the five-ring spell "Divine Healing", he can automatically heal himself when he casts a spell.

So, when he uses "Swift Release", he triggers "Divine Healing" to heal himself, and then the healing effect triggers the "Medical Knowledge" spell, removing his "Dizzy" effect.
Currently, Zhao Xu has not yet mastered the Five-Ring Divine Technique, so he entrusted the "treatment" method to his familiar "Dream", which executed it, and as a result, Zhao Xu himself also fell into these negative states. Dream can also take on the role of resolving Zhao Xu's own state, filling in the last missing piece.

At this point, Zhao Xu is also step by step refining his own abilities, forming a closed loop.
