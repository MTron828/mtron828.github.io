Chapter 485: The Mission After the Legend

"Teacher, I just got here on a whim," Zhao Xu said with a joke.

Anastasia couldn't help but laugh at this and smiled, "Summer."

"Well, the higher-level teleportation spell has more relaxed conditions than the teleportation spell. You only need to describe the destination clearly to teleport. So, there's no need to be so anxious," Anastasia said, looking at Zhao Xu with bright eyes.

Zhao Xu nodded silently and calmed himself down.

It must be said that he had been a bit anxious just now.

For Anastasia and others, Arthur was a lifetime companion. But for Zhao Xu, that was a lifetime ago.

In the teleportation spell of the five rings, the familiarity level would lead to different probabilities of "target accuracy", "target error", "similar region", and "difficult transmission" results. The highest familiarity level was "very familiar", followed by "extremely well-researched", which was at least a level of having seen or frequently visiting the place, or having explored it through magic.

Some were "occasionally seen", "seen once", or "not found". Zhao Xu had heard that some wizards would choose a non-existent destination when teleporting, or a place that had changed greatly due to being left for a long time.
Here is the translation:

At this time, they are transported to a similar region or suffer unexpected harm, which is a 50-50 chance. However, the high-level teleportation technique of the Seventh Ring has no distance limit and will not cause target deviation, even if it's a mistake, it will still appear at the original location, which is much safer than the Fifth Ring.

Anzuel is now telling him these things, which is also a hint to Zhao Xu.

"What if he wasn't Anzuel today? How would he have handled it?"

"Ah, I've learned something," Zhao Xu nodded. "Next time before teleportation, I'll cast a 'Cloaking' spell on myself first."

To be honest, it's because of his memories from his past life that he's too confident in this teleportation process, thinking that the destination won't appear to anyone else.

Who knew he just happened to run into Anzuel, who is actually a master of the "Cloaking" spell.

"Ah, now I know the purpose of that Cloaking Ring," Anzuel said.

Zhao Xu nodded awkwardly after listening.

The Cloaking Ring was originally a new experimental product of the Mystical Association, not something Anzuel created himself.

So, later, he pawned it to the "Guardian" guild, buying all the rights to the Mage Tower ruins.

At that time, Zhao Xu thought that when he reached level 9 without a wizard, he could easily cast the "Cloaking" spell.

He was essentially sacrificing his early progress for his late-game goals.

Naturally, he had to take some losses in the process.

"Alright, let's talk about you," Anzuel said. "You probably won't just show up without a reason."

"Last night, you used the two legendary golems to stir up a big wave in the entire city of Orlu, and today, there's no special reason, so you won't dare to venture in."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Anzhi Noya gazed at Zhao Xiu with a strange look in her eyes, she said, "Normally, when you go on a distant journey, you would usually take precautions and wouldn't take such a risk."

"You revealed the legendary dragon's secrets ahead of time last night, which is already beyond my expectations. Now, you're still going further..."

"Breaking into the stronghold where masters gather."

Anzhi Noya took a few steps closer to Zhao Xiu, until they were almost face-to-face, with their breathing almost touching.

"No matter what, you either found at least a divine artifact or a divine-grade clue, which would make you take such risks."

"Or maybe, I can only understand it as, you're being driven by your lower body, just like a male who's desperate to relieve himself, completely ignoring your own safety."

Zhao Xiu heard this and hastily waved his hand, saying, "Teacher, you're being too exaggerated."

As he spoke, he revealed the past of Fleuret.

Although revealing someone else's secrets is unacceptable, Anzhi Noya could say that she was the closest person to Zhao Xiu.

If Zhao Xiu really couldn't complete Fleuret's revenge, he believed Anzhi Noya would definitely do it for him.

This was also the unspoken agreement between them.

As he spoke, he also mentioned the possible risks and consequences of involving "Grazzett" and the possibility that Fleuret might be a follower of the Demon King.

"Too much of a ceremony," Anzhi Noya judged immediately, "A group of amateur wizards are just rattling their sabers, and she would only be able to push her sword into the void without any special ritual, which would be useless to Grazzett."
Here is the translation:

As soon as Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but hesitate, "What does it mean to take pleasure in the wicked demon? What is it like?"

"It's very simple," Anzhi Noya said with a slight glance at Zhao Xu. "You just need to replace the demon king and Arthur with you and an ant, and it will be fine."

"So-called rituals are just the ants' actions that catch your attention. For example, ants crawling under the table, you might not notice them. But when they crawl onto the table, you might pay attention to them."

"This is the beginning of all rituals."

"Even the ants discover that they are forming a circle on the table, and your attention will be greater. Sometimes you might even scatter food to feed them, and such rituals will form a positive feedback loop."

"A group of ants moving randomly might be interesting at first, but soon you'll become accustomed to it and might even ignore it. Only when they perform a gesture that catches your attention will you pay attention. Gradually, the ants will follow the path of previous success and become a 'ritual' that can successfully summon them."

"This model is originally from the 'surprising universe' where the birth of the cosmos and the coexistence of demons and ordinary people. Now, applying it to the demon and Arthur humans is roughly the same, except that human souls are a supreme delicacy to demons, and even a hard currency."

"Surprising universe?" Zhao Xu murmured to himself after hearing this.

"Don't be surprised, you'll definitely have to come here someday," Anzhi Noya said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Facing such an inexplicable flag, especially the terror of the world he had heard of, Zhao Xu's scalp began to tingle, "Why?"

"You have received the blessings of another universe, so you must fulfill the duty of a Scrollkeeper."

"It's fine during normal times, but when you enter the legend, this mission will automatically take effect. You'll have to go to the Dark Hall of Knowledge in the terrifying universe to repair the 'Ancient Cursed Slate' and record what you know."

"This is the mission of every Scrollkeeper who enters the legend stage. Even if you're separated by a universe, you must fulfill this duty."

"Furthermore, when you arrive at that world, you can choose to become a 'Pollution Alchemist' too."

Zhao Xu reacted instantly when he heard this.

The ancient Scrollkeeper who had once come to Arthur, using legendary magic, summoned the 'Ancient Cursed Slate' and allowed Arthur's people to become Scrollkeepers.

However, Arthur's Scrollkeepers had only seen the "projection" of the Ancient Cursed Slate, not the real thing.

No one had seen the real Ancient Cursed Slate, so they couldn't use the same magical method to recreate it.

In theory, all Arthur's Scrollkeepers should be taught by the legendary Scrollkeeper of the terrifying universe.

However, now he was not the original Scrollkeeper who had passed on the Scroll.

Anniyana had once gone to the Dark Hall of Knowledge in the terrifying universe and saw the real Slate, which is why he could force Zhao Xu to summon and recreate it for him.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's mind kept replaying everything that had happened since he took office.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems that these gifts of fate are quite expensive," Zhao Xu sighed.

Just being in another universe's foundation profession had brought about such legendary terms.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu looked at An Ti Nuo Ya with a mix of surprise and trepidation.

As for him being cultivated by An Ti Nuo Ya without any bottom line, he felt even more unable to repay the debt.

"Let's go, don't just stand there," An Ti Nuo Ya suddenly pushed Zhao Xu with her elbow, "Since it's like this, let's go and search for clues first. See how deep the trail of Graze is."

As she spoke, she raised her hand with the Snowy Frost aura and pointed at Zhao Xu from afar.

【Adventurer Summer, you are affected by the "Ultimate Concealment" spell, which makes you invisible, odorless, and silent. You only retain touch and taste, and will not reappear after attacking.】

When Zhao Xu felt the power of the "Ultimate Concealment" spell, which was the strongest among the concealment spells, he couldn't help but feel its might.

"First stop, let's search An Fuli's bedroom first," An Ti Nuo Ya suggested.

"Ah, that's not very good?" Zhao Xu felt a sense of shame and couldn't help but feel embarrassed, realizing that An Ti Nuo Ya had given him this top-level concealment spell with such an intention.

"Hmph, don't regret it later."
