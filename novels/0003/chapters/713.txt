Chapter 714: Absorbing Power

"A real interesting person, it's been many years since someone has dared to gaze at me with such nonchalance," a flirtatious female voice came from afar.

Before Zhao Xuan could turn around, a beautiful woman with a seductive aura appeared before him, as if she had torn through the void to get here. It was evident that Zhao Xuan's arrival had been detected and responded to promptly by the other party.

The woman's bright red lips were curled into a smile, but her eyebrows were arched in a mischievous manner. Her long, black hair cascaded down her back, and her eyes sparkled with a mixture of emotions and desires. What was even more astonishing was that she had a pair of wide and well-proportioned wings sprouting from her back, with the edges of the wings emitting a sharp, knife-like light.

The woman's tail was also long and demonic, with the tip curled upwards. Zhao Xuan gazed at this demonic woman dressed in a delicate, translucent silk gown, and said, "It's an honor to meet you, Queen of Sirens, Madam Moket."

"Oh? Really? Well, since everyone already knows my identity, this game just isn't interesting anymore," Queen of Sirens said with a light laugh.

Her gaze at Zhao Xuan was laced with a hint of provocation.

This Queen of Sirens, Madam Moket, was a hedonist who enjoyed pleasure and used her charms to control and destroy those around her. What was even more terrifying was that her beauty was a source of unparalleled evil power, allowing her to absorb life force from good beings, even manipulate the hearts of living creatures.
Here's the translation:

Moreover, for those foolish individuals who attempt to use magical spells to control this witch queen, once they fail to influence the other party, these spells will rebound against the caster. Zhao Xū sighed slightly and said, "I was just passing by here, but you should be residing in the 'Paradise' of Shendi Lüwei, and suddenly appearing here has left me with a sense of shock."

The witch queen couldn't help but burst into laughter, her voice being extremely melodious, to the point where ordinary people would be entranced and fall into a trance upon hearing it.

However, as Zhao Xū gazed at her, his mind involuntarily conjured up more knowledge about her.

As he was exposed to this abyss, he began to feel the power of the abyss returning to him.

He also gained insight into the inner workings of things.

For instance, the witch queen derived immense pleasure from receiving cruel treatment from others.

In her palace, there were many male and female demons, including a 13-piece poet band called the "Luminous Nun" orchestra, which catered exclusively to the witch queen.

Most notably, he silently discovered that the witch queen had two extremely powerful allies, or rather, two lovers - Pazuzu and Demogorgon.

Furthermore, the witch queen was also acquainted with multiple demonic lords, although most of these encounters were merely recreational activities for her.

"Since you've come to my place, won't you stay and have a seat in my palace?" the witch queen coquettishly smiled.

However, Zhao Xū shook his head, saying, "No, I have a light taste and don't like your recreational activities."

Instantly, the witch queen's expression changed, and her entire body seemed to swell up, as her power began to surge forth continuously.

"Is this your attitude towards a lord of the abyss?"
Zhao Xū微微地摇了摇头。 He began to sense this familiar yet strange profound power, and he wouldn't choose to collide with a being as potent as the queen of demons, even if it was just a spider's silk. However, the queen of demons was different this time, using her beauty to control the lord of the abyss, and Zhao Xū felt that her strength had weakened by a few degrees. He was playing it safe and easy, which was understandable.

Zhao Xū remained completely still throughout the process, as if he was sensing the lord of the abyss's profound power being imposed on him. However, this energy infusion was actually making him stronger.

Zhao Xū even felt a sense of grandeur, and the abyss once again called out his name, bestowing more power upon him.

Just one touch, and Zhao Xū found a way to extract the lord of the abyss's power, which was swift and effortless. It was as if the lord of the abyss was a clay statue, full of flaws and vulnerabilities, and Zhao Xū easily found a way to infiltrate and absorb the power.

In his mind, Zhao Xū was filled with doubts and caution, and he was unsure whether he should fully accept this power. "Huh? No?" Suddenly, the queen of demons let out a sharp cry, and the current situation was probably the first time she had encountered such a complex situation in her life.

However, Zhao Xū chose to remain still. The energy transmission remained steady, as if the queen of demons was actively supplying Zhao Xū with the most fundamental and original power of the abyss.
Here is the translation:

In the past, a few powerful demons have secretly challenged the Demon Queen, and even received help from other demon lords. Notably, there was Grazzit. The Demon Queen had once publicly declared that Grazzit had attempted to court her, but she had rejected him, which had led to a lifelong grudge between them.

At this moment, the Demon Queen was feeling unprecedented fear for the first time in her life. Her lips trembled as she asked, "Who are you? Why is my power being drained towards you?"

Even the Demon Queen wanted to turn around and escape from the awkward situation, but no matter how hard she tried, she seemed to be stuck in the mud, with no way to resist.

"Don't struggle anymore," Zhao Xuyu sighed softly.

"I'm not sure if my choice is right or wrong, but perhaps I'll approach this strange ability with a learner's attitude and research it thoroughly. It's not necessarily a bad thing."

"Although your face is more beautiful than that of a demon lord who exudes evil, I think you'll be a better choice," Zhao Xuyu smiled slightly.

However, this smile was seen as extremely evil by the Demon Queen, filled with malicious intentions.

"Do you know who I am?" the Demon Queen asked.

"Or do you know how many demon lords are hiding behind me?"

"You're using a method I don't know how to achieve, but you'll definitely become enemies with all the demon lords in the underworld, which is a fire that even the gods cannot tolerate."

But Zhao Xuyu remained nonchalant, smirking.

"Do you think I've gotten this far and I'm still afraid of these things?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Or maybe, if those evil lords could see this live broadcast, I think most of them would clap and cheer. But you, listen to me."

"I suddenly feel the grandeur of your power, or rather, you underestimate your own potential."

As she spoke, the enchantress queen deliberately showed off her slender curves, although she was still struggling to resist the feeling of being drained of her power, but she still managed to maintain her composure and said:

"If we work together, I can appoint you as the master and serve you as your maid."

Zhao Xu shook his head, "No need, just shut up and let me absorb more power, so I can conduct my research."

At this moment, the deep-seated power surged through Zhao Xu's body like a lively force, stimulating his body and even making him feel his life force increasing constantly.

He was like a reservoir, constantly accumulating energy.

Even he could feel that once he had refined his entire upgrading route, he could convert these life energies into the most solid level at any time.

It was as if the threshold of a legend was right before his eyes.

Zhao Xu slightly lifted his head, gazing at the enchantress queen, and said, "Can you open this pipe a bit wider? My absorption of power is a bit slow."

The enchantress queen looked at his suggestion with no hesitation, and couldn't help but curse, "Are you still a man? You're looking at me as if you have no desire at all?"

"Ha ha, I've heard that many powerful mages are actually weak in body and rely on taking medicine to regain their vigor. Are you also one of those miserable creatures?"
The mysterious queen of magic suddenly changed her strategy, switching back to a mocking approach and forcing this enigmatic strong individual to take action against her. If the other person tried to torment her, she could put on a pitiful expression and even provide enough "torture" to satisfy their curiosity. As long as they spent enough time together, she would have enough confidence to gradually corrupt this mysterious mage in a warm and gentle way. Men are always prone to pity and even sympathy towards women, and the phrase "warm and gentle" is not just empty talk. She had already accumulated a vast amount of experience in this regard, having even manipulated legendary mages in the past. Or, we could say that her growth throughout her journey was achieved through continuous self-strengthening. Every man with a shade of evil in his heart is a stepping stone for her. Every devil she captures will contribute to her power. As for now, as long as the other party stops this despicable absorption method, it's fine. It's clear that they have the backing of the abyss, able to resist all forms of absorption. Why can this mysterious mage still achieve this? The mysterious queen of magic felt puzzled. Even the chaotic abyss would not deviate from the basic laws of magic. However, Zhao Xu chuckled, "A person will not have desires for their own cells." Hearing Zhao Xu's ambiguous words, the mysterious queen of magic did not react, but instead saw the thick, unyielding energy bar growing more and more prominent with time, and exclaimed urgently, "Stop it for me!" She could already feel her soul's abyssal power beginning to waver.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even she couldn't feel it, the kind of willpower that was crushing her, making her unable to move, and she felt a sense of fear, fear of the higher being.

As a powerful demon queen, she didn't know how long it had been since she'd experienced this strange feeling.

"You are?" she said, her voice laced with suspicion, her eyes filled with an unshakeable sense of fear.

At this moment, she only wished she had surrendered earlier and shown her submission.

She couldn't help but think of a possibility that made her dare not think too deeply about it, as if once it appeared, it would be the greatest blasphemy.

The abyss.

All demons knew that their source of power and will came from the abyss.

It was the source of their strength and will, given to them by the abyss.

Zhao Xiu saw that the other party had finally calmed down, and he didn't think too much about it, still busy with his busywork, slowly draining the other's energy with a small water pipe.

However, he felt like he was just like a vast ocean, no matter how much he poured in, the energy was difficult to form a scale.

Even Zhao Xiu felt a sense of fullness, but hard to describe.

Zhao Xiu sighed.

"Big sister, can't you just increase the supply a bit?"

The demon queen bit her teeth, "What did you say?"

"Or Auntie?" Zhao Xiu was surprised.

"Or Grandma?" Zhao Xiu said.

Although her age was high enough to deserve a higher ranking, but I couldn't call it out.

Zhao Xiu lowered his head silently, then looked up silently, scanning the demon queen's body before looking away.
Here's the translation:

"Don't think you can use your beauty to affect his speed of drawing his sword."
However, the Witch Queen suddenly bit her lip and a stream of blood fell down, immediately igniting and burning on the ground. Her expression turned into a grotesque and terrifying one, with mysterious tracks appearing on her body. "I give you the deepest curse in the name of the Lord of the Abyss!"
The Witch Queen laughed with a mocking smile, "Do you think I'm waiting for your begging?"
"I'm just accumulating more power to awaken the original energy of this land."
"You still have a shallow understanding of the Abyss."
However, Zhao Xu remained unmoved, as if everything was just a joke.

Instantly, countless powers from the Abyss surged towards Zhao Xu from all directions, forming a spider web-like pattern that wrapped around him tightly. Each strand carried the Witch Queen's deepest curse and anger.

As soon as they touched Zhao Xu's body, they vanished like smoke, leaving no trace behind, as if they had fallen into a fire pit. Zhao Xu spoke coldly, "How can you possibly use my powers to interfere with me?"

The Witch Queen stopped in her tracks and uttered an unbelievable statement:

"The ancient and eternal existence has descended upon the world, bringing with it the consciousness of the world's birth. The Abyss will welcome its true master. When that time comes, the River of Darkness will flow backwards, and a new battle will spread across the world, determining the final destruction or rebirth."
