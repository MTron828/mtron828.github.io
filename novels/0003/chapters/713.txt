Chapter 714: Absorbing Power

"A really interesting person, it's been a long time since someone has dared to gaze at me with such nonchalance," a playful female voice came.

Before Zhao Xuan could turn around, a beautiful woman with a seductive appearance suddenly appeared before him, as if she had torn through the void to get there. It was clear that Zhao Xuan's arrival in this place had been anticipated and timely.

The woman's red lips curved into a smile, and her eyes sparkled with various emotions and desires. What was even more astonishing was that she had a pair of wide and well-groomed wings on her back, with sharp blades visible at each joint. Her tail also had a devil's tail at the end, curled up.

Zhao Xuan looked at the devil woman wearing a delicate and translucent silk dress and said, "It's nice to meet you, Queen of Seduction, Miss Beckman."

"Oh? It's not interesting at all, since you already know my identity, this game won't be fun anymore," Queen of Seduction said with a light laugh.

Her gaze at Zhao Xuan carried a subtle hint of flirting.

This Queen of Seduction, Miss Beckman, was a hedonist who used her charm to control and destroy those around her. Moreover, her beauty was a source of unparalleled evil power, allowing her to absorb life force from innocent creatures and even manipulate the minds of living beings through various abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

Moreover, for those foolish individuals who attempt to control this witch queen with their charms, once they fail to influence the other party, these spells will rebound on the caster. Zhao Xiu sighed slightly and said, "I'm just passing through this place, and it's you who should be living in this 'heaven' of Shendi Lai Wei. Suddenly appearing makes me feel a bit uneasy."

The witch queen couldn't help but burst out laughing, her voice being very pleasant, and ordinary people who heard it would be so mesmerized that they would directly fall into a trance, losing consciousness at her feet.

As Zhao Xiu looked at her, he couldn't help but have more and more knowledge about her appearing in his mind.

As he was exposed to this abyss, he seemed to begin to feel the power of the abyss returning.

He also learned more about the inner workings of things.

For example, this queen liked to obtain extreme pleasure from the torture she inflicted on others.

In her palace, there were many male and female demons, including a 13-member poet group called the "Luminous Sisters" of the royal orchestra, which served this queen.

Mainly, he silently knew about the queen's two most powerful allies, or rather, her two lovers - Pazuzu and Demogorgon.

Even more ridiculously, this witch queen still had many demonic leaders who visited her, although most of them were just her hobbies and benefits.

"Why don't you come to my palace and sit down?" the witch queen coquettishly said.

However, Zhao Xiu just waved his hand, "No, my taste is light, and I don't like your hobbies."

Instantly, the witch queen's expression changed, and her entire body seemed to swell up, simultaneously releasing her power.

"Is this how you treat a lord of the abyss?"
Zhao Xu subtly shook his head.

He began to sense the familiar yet strange depths of power, and for someone like Luo Si, who had just encountered him, he was a real god. He had eaten the heart of a bear and the gallbladder of a tiger, and he wouldn't choose him as the first collision object.

However, at this moment, the demon queen was different. She controlled the lord of the depths with her beauty, and no matter how it sounded, she was weak. He was taking the easy way out and had a good reason to do so.

Zhao Xu remained motionless throughout the process, as if he was feeling the invasion of the depths of power by the other side. However, this energy transfer was actually making him stronger.

Zhao Xu even felt a sense of grandeur, and the depths of power once again called out his name, including giving him more power.

After just one touch, Zhao Xu found a way to extract the power of the lord of the depths, and he was so quick that he was having trouble reacting.

It was as if the other side was like a statue, with flaws and loopholes all over its body, and he easily found a way to invade and absorb the power.

In his mind, he was filled with doubts and caution, and he was unsure whether he should accept this power thoroughly.

"Um... no?"

Suddenly, the demon queen let out a sharp cry, and the complex situation was probably something she had never encountered in her entire life.

However, Zhao Xu chose to hold back at this moment.

The energy transfer remained deadlocked, as if the demon queen was actively sending the most essential and original power of the depths to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the past, many powerful demons have secretly challenged the Queen of Hell, and even some demon lords have assisted them. Notably, Glazet. The Queen of Hell had previously announced to the outside world that Glazet had attempted to woo her, but she rejected him brutally, which led to a lifelong feud between them.

Now, the Queen of Hell is feeling an unprecedented sense of panic for the first time in her life. Her lips trembled as she said, "Who are you, exactly? Why is my power constantly being drained towards you?"

Even the Queen of Hell wanted to turn her body and break free from the current awkward situation, but no matter how hard she tried, she felt like she was stuck in the mud with no room for resistance.

"Don't struggle," Zhao Xu sighed softly.

"I don't know if my choice is right or wrong. But in this moment, I might as well take a scholarly approach and study this strange ability. It might not be a bad thing."

"Although your face is quite ordinary, compared to the demon lord who emits a foul stench, you are more beautiful. I think you would be a better choice."

However, Zhao Xu's smile seemed extremely evil to the Queen of Hell, with a hint of malevolent intent.

"Do you know who I am?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Or do you know how many demon lords are hiding behind me?"

"You're using your methods on me, but I don't know how you're doing it. But you're bound to make enemies with all the demon lords in the Underworld, and that's a fire that even the gods cannot bear."

However, Zhao Xu just shrugged nonchalantly.

"Do you think I've come this far and still fear these things?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Or maybe, if those demon lords could see this live broadcast, I think the applause would be overwhelming, but I'm afraid it would still be the majority."

"No, listen to me,"

"I suddenly felt the greatness of your power, or rather, you underestimated your own potential size."

As she spoke, the sorceress queen intentionally highlighted her slender figure, although she was still struggling to endure the sensation of being drained of her power, but she remained calm and said:

"If you and I work together, I can enshrine you as the master and serve as your maidservant by your side."

Zhao Xu shook his head, "No need, just shut up and let me absorb more power, I want to do some research."

At this moment, the dark powers surged through Zhao Xu's body like a living force, stimulating his body and even causing him to feel his life force increasing.

He was like a reservoir, constantly accumulating energy.

He could even feel that, once he had clarified the entire upgrade path, he could convert these life energies into the most solid levels at any moment.

It seemed like the threshold of legend was within reach.

Zhao Xu slightly lifted his head, gazing at the sorceress queen, and said, "Can you open this tap a bit wider? My speed of absorbing power is a bit slow."

The sorceress queen looked at her suggestion, and Zhao Xu didn't even have the time to think about it before she burst out laughing, "Are you still a man? You're not even showing any desire after seeing me?"

"Ha ha, I've heard that many powerful mages are actually weak in reality, and they even need to take medicine to get their strength back. I don't think you're one of those pathetic creatures, are you?"
The moment the enchantress queen changed her strategy, she reverted to her mocking approach, forcing the mysterious strong one to take action against her.

As soon as her opponent attempted to torment her, she would put on a pitiful expression and even provide enough "torture" for the opponent to satisfy their morbid curiosity.

As long as they spent enough time together, she would have enough confidence to gradually corrupt this mysterious sorcerer in the warmth of her affection.

Men are always inclined to sympathize with women and even feel compassion for them, and the warmth of affection is far from being an empty phrase.

She had accumulated a vast amount of experience in this regard, and her hands had even held legendary sorcerers in the past. It can be said that her entire growth process was built on the foundation of using such methods to gradually become stronger.

Every man with a colored intention is a stepping stone for her.

Every devil she had captured would contribute key powers to her.

As for now, as long as her opponent stopped their despicable absorption method, it would be fine.

Although they had the patronage of the deep abyss and could resist all absorption methods, why could this mysterious sorcerer still do such things?

The enchantress queen felt utterly perplexed.

Not even the chaotic deep abyss would allow excessive chaos to occur in the most basic laws.

However, Zhao Xu smiled and said, "A person will not have desires for their own cells."

Listening to Zhao Xu's ambiguous words, the enchantress queen remained unresponsive, only seeing the thick, unyielding energy bar that became increasingly apparent with the passage of time, and exclaimed urgently, "Stop it for me!"

She had already felt her soul's deep abyssal power beginning to waver.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even she couldn't feel it, this willpower, which was extremely oppressive, making her unable to move, and she felt a sense of fear.

The fear of the superior being.

Since becoming a powerful demon lord, the Queen of Demons had never felt this strange sensation before.

"What are you?"

She let out a suspicious voice, with eyes that conveyed an unbearable fear.

At this moment, she only hated herself for not having expressed her submission earlier.

A thought suddenly flashed through her mind, but she couldn't bear to think about it further, as if it would lead to the greatest blasphemy.

The Abyss.

All demons knew that their source of power and will came from the Abyss.

It was the source of their strength and power, granted by the Abyss.

Zhao Xiu looked at the other party, who had finally calmed down, and didn't think much of it, still busily working as a busy bee, gradually draining the other party's energy with a small water pipe.

However, he himself was like a vast ocean, and no matter how much energy he absorbed, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satiety.

Zhao Xiu sighed.

"Big sister, can't you increase the supply a bit?"

The Queen of Demons bit her teeth. "What did you say?"

"Ah, Auntie?" Zhao Xiu was surprised.

"Or Grandma?" Zhao Xiu said.

Although your age is sufficient to earn a higher status, but I can't call you out loud.

Zhao Xiu said.

As expected, even a female demon, no matter how strong, has some room for banter, especially when facing someone like Grazz, who is not afraid to fight to the death.

Zhao Xiu lowered his head silently, then lifted it again, glanced at the Queen of Demons' body, and then stopped looking.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Don't think you can use your charm to slow down my sword's speed."

However, the Witch Queen suddenly bit her lip and a stream of fresh blood fell to the ground, instantly igniting and burning, her expression becoming incredibly ferocious. Mysterious tracks appeared on her body, incredibly intricate.

"With the power of the abyss, by the name of the abyss's lord, I give you the deepest curse!"
The Witch Queen shouted.

She also let out a laugh that seemed to tear apart, "Do you think I was waiting for your plea?"

"I was just accumulating even greater power to stir up the source of this land," she said.

"But your understanding of the abyss is still very superficial."

However, Zhao Xuyu remained unmoved, as if everything was just a joke.

In an instant, countless powers of the abyss gushed in from all directions, like a spider's web, directly wrapping themselves around Zhao Xuyu.

Each strand carried the Witch Queen's deepest curse and anger.

But as soon as they touched Zhao Xuyu's body, they instantly dissipated, like snowflakes falling into a fire, leaving no trace behind.

Zhao Xuyu spoke calmly, "How can you possibly use my power to interfere with me?"

The Witch Queen stopped in her tracks and uttered a unbelievable phrase:

"An ancient and immortal existence brings the consciousness of the world's birth, and the abyss will welcome its true master. When that time comes, the River of Darkness will flow backwards, and a new bloodbath will spread to the world, deciding the ultimate destruction or restart."
