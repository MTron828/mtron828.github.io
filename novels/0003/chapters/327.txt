Chapter 328: Bundling the Gods

Zhao Xuan gazed at the small red-painted building in front of him, and his mind was already filled with over ten guesses.

As for why the half-breed Peter would deliberately come out, he could basically guess the reason. If he dared to fly up to the sky, it was definitely like being shot down like a target.

Only the wind could freely traverse the high skies of Mistral.

For Peter, who wanted to escape, his gaze had to be directed towards the underground tunnels beneath Mistral, where there was a vast and intricate network of sewer tunnels. This was also the only dark and hidden place where Mistral's inhabitants could flee.

If the opponent had special means to block detection, as long as he could get out of Mistral before being chased, he would have a chance to survive.

According to Peter's guess, he would contact the Mistral police, reach the scene, collect information, and then handle the case through the "processing program" - this was the time the opponent was trying to seize.

However, if the opponent suddenly engaged in a battle with him, unless he could take a beating, it would only shorten this time.

It would be better to let himself report the case and follow the procedure to delay for a longer time.

At least, he would have to explain himself to the security department first.

In reality, if he hadn't appeared abruptly, Peter might have been able to slowly tidy up the scene and then escape using disguising techniques.

The brutal and gruesome torture and killing that occurred in the living room made Zhao Xuan suspect that there might be a special ritual involved, no longer just a simple burglary case as he initially thought.

So, at this moment, Zhao Xuan wasn't rushing to break into the house, but was instead waiting outside, guarding himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

Once a strange creature emerges from the house, he will suddenly take action.

As for "Peter", who is being pressed to the ground and firmly held by the creature, he no longer cares.

With the opponent's strength of over ten points, it is basically impossible for Peter, who has a normal intelligence, to break free from the control of the demon with a strength of nearly 30 points.

Moreover, the demon itself has dark vision, and Peter, who is not a genius, cannot help but know that. As a result, his opponent will still cast spells, which is actually showing that he can only treat a dead horse as if it were alive.

In addition, there is no need for the opponent to perform any actions.

As for other possibilities, even if Peter finds another way to become a one-ring wizard, he will definitely be unable to cast spells in a situation where he is being held captive and cannot move. This is because most spells require specific gestures.

The main way for a warrior like Zhao Xun to become a one-ring wizard is to rely on pinning down the opponent and preventing them from casting spells.

Finally, Elton took out the "High-Level Inspector" badge left by Zhao Xun and immediately jumped through a series of procedures, and a team of 12 members of the "Rose Cross" arrived, followed by a group of guards.

Unlike the "Mystic Guardians" system in the city of Mistrak, the members of the Rose Cross are primarily wizards and priests, and are also accompanied by other relevant professions, with combat levels ranging from level 3 to level 20.

At this moment, according to Elton's description, the leader of the team is a 5-level priest, and most of his teammates are around level 3 or 4, which is enough to handle general situations.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is also a rapid response team of the Rose Cross, equipped to quickly intervene in the event of the appearance of evil, otherworldly beings. They are well-prepared with various emergency support items and magical items.

In the past, a low-level team was under the control of the powerful demon "Balroth" and managed to escape for several rounds before a high-level mage arrived to provide support.

Meanwhile, the security personnel of Mistral were stationed at the periphery of the scene, mostly at the 1st level, and could only perform a formal blockade.

When the Rose Cross's priest team arrived at the scene, they noticed a scene where a soul-cursed demon was pinning down a human who had transformed into a half-demonic being.

To put it bluntly, it was a dog-eat-dog situation.

Although they had a rough idea of what had happened, most people in the team couldn't help but wrinkle their brows when they saw the undead soul-cursed demon.

As part of their usual business, they also dealt with these undead beings half the time.

At the same time, the team members were also looking at Zhao Xu's figure.

Being able to control a soul-cursed demon that was a level 11 challenge meant that the opponent was a powerful mage in his own right.

In Mistral City, powerful mages were known as strong individuals or authorities.

Zhao Xu didn't waste any words and immediately communicated with the middle-aged priest on the scene, clarifying their command structure.

As the commander, the most convenient thing was that many things no longer required him to take personal action; he only needed to arrange things.

As the commander, he only needed to arrange things.
Here is the translation of the text:

After hearing Zhao Xu's arrangements, the four-man team, led by a warrior, approached. Lin Ke directly pulled out a rusty iron ball with a diameter of about 7-8 centimeters and threw it at the now robust Peter.

Since Peter was already firmly controlled by Zhao Xu, he was unable to move or dodge, and the iron ball hit him with a heavy impact.

Seeing this scene, Zhao Xu immediately gestured to the soul demon. The soul demon quickly released its claws, which resembled a crab's pincers, and slowly retreated back to its original spiritual realm.

Peter, who thought the other party had made a mistake, hastily unfolded his wings and planned to fly low and escape sideways. Initially, he was cautious and did not dare to fly, but now he no longer cared.

However, the rusty iron ball that hit him did not let him get hurt. Instead, it was wrapped around his body with iron wire, tightly binding him.

Every time Peter tried to struggle, he felt a deep pressure transmitted through the iron wire, and it became increasingly difficult for him to move. He could only let out a loud shout, open his mouth wide, and seem to want to bite something, but was completely powerless.

"Elder, what is this?" Elliot exclaimed, with a thought appearing in his mind.

"No mistake, it's the Bilaya Binding Rope," Zhao Xu said.

The Bilaya Binding Rope is a magical item that can automatically bind enemies, requiring a minimum of 30 force points to break free. Without 30 or more force points, there is no chance of escape.
Here is the translation of the text:

Of course, most people rely on their own agility and combine it with the "escape" skill to break free, with a difficulty level of nearly 30 stages. However, since Peter has not broken free from the binding, he naturally cannot use the escape skill to break free from the ropes.

"Isn't it the same as using chains?" Elliot thought to himself, frowning.

"Just your intelligence," Zhao Xu said. "The chains can only immobilize your feet or hands, but the other party has wings, and even if they are restricted in movement, they are not completely unable to act."

"The most important thing is that as long as the steel ball of the binding is hit, it will take effect immediately."

At this moment, the warrior who specialized in binding looked down and checked the binding to make sure it was secure before finally relaxing.

He whispered to the other companions, "The elder looks too young to have obtained the high-level inspector's badge. I don't know if I can get a probationary inspector's badge when I retire. I don't dare to think about it at all."

The hunter who had just thrown the binding steel ball at the enemy sneered and smiled. "Do you know that high-level inspectors have a hard and fast rule?"

"What? Isn't it just a matter of accumulating enough points?"

"No, it's about killing a powerful demon or devil, such as a level 20 challenge demon from the depths of hell, and it has to be done solo."

The three people looked back at Zhao Xu, who was chatting with the middle-aged priest, with a mixture of surprise and admiration. Did the young priest who looked like he was still young enough to be a novice actually achieve a legendary feat?

However, Zhao Xu didn't seem to notice. He turned to the middle-aged priest and said, "Understood?"

The middle-aged priest, who was dressed in full armor and holding a hammer, looked at Zhao Xu with a serious expression, and from his gaze, it was clear that he had understood Zhao Xu's past achievements, so he was extremely respectful from start to finish.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He knew the strong person in front of him, who was not far from a legend, hurriedly nodded, "Understood."

"That's it, let's go in and investigate, be cautious first." Zhao Xu repeated his warning.

At this time, the other four people responsible for restraining the half-refined hell creature, Peter, also walked over and pulled him to come and identify the scene.

The wanderer in the team suddenly rushed forward and pushed open the door before Zhao Xu.

Just as the door creaked open again, the bloody smell filled the air.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt a slight numbness all over his body, as if he had been electrified.

He immediately turned around and looked towards the location of the Magic Goddess Shrine.

At the same time, the legendary undead staff attached to his waist with a buckle also started to shake.

His first "hidden" disciple changed history and finally went online.
