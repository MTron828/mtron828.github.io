Chapter 329: Eternal Life of Interdimensional Beings

"Is there something wrong?" Middle-aged pastor Goda looked at Zhao Xu with a curious gaze, thinking that the other person might have discovered something amiss.

"No, I just suddenly thought of an old acquaintance and felt a little sentimental," Zhao Xu said.

Middle-aged pastor Goda's thoughts shifted slightly upon hearing these words. He was a devout believer who respected the gods, followed the teachings, and never dared to compare himself to others. His selection to join the "Rose Cross" emergency response team and even become the team leader was a testament to his dedication.

However, Goda was also aware that if he didn't find another opportunity, he wanted to continue to break through and achieve the standard of a bishop who could be sent to other regions, which was a slim possibility.

This wasn't because he wasn't devout enough, but rather that everyone was too devout. As long as one's brain functioned properly in a world where one could witness divine power, unless one had an alternative channel for ability, one would inevitably kneel down to worship the gods.

Even in ancient times, when divine power was not evident, people would still create images of gods.

Mages relied on intangible magical networks to obtain magical abilities and could take pride in themselves. In contrast, these pastors, who received all their divine abilities from the goddess, had absolute faith and reverence for the gods, with no room for compromise.

As a result, each pastor had an unyielding faith and reverence for the gods, with no exceptions. Without any opportunity, relying solely on daily morning and evening prayers, it would be difficult to get even the slightest attention from the gods.

Goda was clear that sometimes, there were alternative paths to take.

As for the so-called "high-level inspector" master, he is his shortcut. The other party's influence is already sufficient to help him. Perhaps this is also the other party's hint. Because the entire process is what he initiated, and the other party only responded.

After thinking for a moment, Zhaohu quietly said, "Inspector, I happen to be responsible for training pastors at the church."

"Just tell me your name, and I can, within my capabilities, provide some theological explanations for your deceased acquaintance, as long as you don't think my knowledge is too limited."

Zhaohu carefully considered it before still mustering the courage to say these words.

"Thank you for your concern, Pastor Zhaohu. If needed, I'll trouble you."

Zhao Xu heard this and also politely thanked the other party.

It's also hard to get pastors to speak so politely, and the theological explanation was actually hinting that he could provide help within a certain range for Zheng Xin'an.

However, Zhao Xu also understood that this was not uncommon in this world.

This world cannot possibly be just plain monster-killing. As long as he intervenes in this society, he will encounter different personnel and their requests.

Others will also flatter him due to his influence and arrange various accommodations for him.

In his previous life, he was a small town's law enforcement officer, and he had to face the same level of political environment.

Those who understand this are secretly smiling at themselves, the team leader, who finally knows how to open his mouth. Meanwhile, the saint warrior standing on the side, holding a long sword and vigilantly monitoring the situation inside, was completely unaffected by their conversation.
Here is the translation of the text:

Eilton was originally puzzled by the sudden topic brought up by the middle-aged pastor. After some thought, he finally began to understand.

This also made his heart start racing.

If he had continued to sit calmly in class, he would have been unable to touch on these things.

But by following his mysterious instructor, he directly witnessed a gruesome scene and came into contact with the extraordinary power of Mister Stra.

Compared to the city guard's magic defense, the enigmatic "Rose Cross" team was even more mysterious. They were side by side, preparing to enter the exploration together.

"Ah——"

At this moment, the wooden door that had been closed was pushed open by a wanderer, and the bloody scene inside the hall suddenly fell into everyone's eyes.

Even though the team code-named "Vacuum" had seen many turbulent waves, they were still hard to accept what they saw.

Eilton took a deep breath and began to recount what they had encountered since entering the room.

When he had someone to command his direct subordinates, he could take it easy, only supplementing for others in minor details.

"Expert, come and take a look," the pastor said to the team member behind him, a robust man with a beard.

The expert pushed his glasses up his nose and walked forward, carrying a tool bag with a knife and other tools.

He was the only assistant in the team, specializing in professional fields such as medicine, forensic medicine, and surgery. In his spare time, he conducted research at the forensic department of the police station, sometimes assisting in investigations. Today, he happened to be on duty with the small team and followed everyone out together.
Here is the translation of the text:

Eilton held his breath, trying to suppress his fear and tremble as he took another step forward to enter the room. However, Zhao Xu gently grabbed his shoulder, but Eilton managed to wriggle free.

Then, he looked awkwardly at Zhao Xu and said, "I can overcome it." Taking another deep breath, he added, "Otherwise, I wouldn't be worthy of following you, sir."

After understanding the badge of the "Rose Cross" high-ranking inspector given to him by Zhao Xu, Eilton realized that this wizard was undoubtedly a powerful figure, possibly even a direct subordinate of a prominent figure.

Only someone as strong as this wizard could help him take revenge, and he needed to prove his worth to the other party. Although his heart was moved by the other party's concern for him, he also felt the need to prove himself.

However, Zhao Xu interrupted Eilton's thoughts, saying, "Before you cast your spell, stand still behind me. Otherwise, I won't be able to save you even if you die."

This remark left the guards standing beside him, including the Empty Space Squad, looking embarrassed, as if a crow had flown by.

However, after Zhao Xu's reminder, everyone immediately focused their attention on observing the situation in front of them.

They realized that it was unlikely that the inspector would rush into the unknown without investigating, and that the movements inside the room might not be ordinary.

The 4th-level Saint Warrior took a slight step forward, wearing a shining full-body armor with only a few gaps around the joints and helmet. His arms were fixed with a heavy steel shield to resist potential attacks from the front, leaving only his right hand holding a finely crafted long sword and facing the void.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

For players at the current level, being able to get equipment like the Holy Warrior's at level 3-4 is basically satisfying. As for later, it's just a matter of gradually replacing the armor and weapons with magical equipment.

By the time that happens, everyone will have to start from "+1" magical equipment and gradually climb up to "+5" magical equipment.

The process of upgrading equipment is endless.

"This case is probably the most shocking one I've handled in recent years," said the autopsy expert, his face solemn, as he puffed on his belly.

It's undeniable that after this case becomes public knowledge, everyone will know about it by tomorrow.

"What kind of ritual is this?" the middle-aged priest asked as he approached the half-transformed Peter, who was now a half-demonic creature.

The sound of dripping water that Zhao Xu had heard earlier was actually the sound of the bodies being cut open.

"Ah," Peter sneered, turning his head with a disdainful expression, ignoring the other's question.

This made the Holy Warrior look angry, and he immediately held his long sword against the other's neck. "You, a scoundrel who killed your own parents, I'll purify you eventually."

The Holy Warrior looked relatively young, but his hands were already red and swollen from gripping the sword tightly. "When did you realize you would be transformed into a half-demonic creature?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

But Peter just kept his mouth shut and ignored the question.

"You abandoned the awakening ritual and used psychological barriers to push away the past. It's probably because you knew that once you sat on the throne, the things that appeared on the throne of the Law would expose you, such as summoning demons?" Zhao Xu continued to analyze.
Here is the translation of the text:

Eilton's eyes lit up when he heard the name "Ophelian Throne", and his expression turned envious. That position was the ultimate dream of every young mystic like him.

"Since you can demonstrate your talents in school, it means you didn't know you would become what you are now, a half-human, half-demon hybrid. And since the floating city is a closed management system, we can easily investigate the people you've been in contact with since you awakened on the island a year ago," Zhao Xu continued to analyze.

At this moment, Peter's expression finally changed, but he still managed to maintain his composure.

"However, judging from your current expression, it seems you also voluntarily became a half-demon being," Zhao Xu said, looking at the clock on the wall with a cold and detached gaze. The time was ticking away, one minute at a time.

"Sir, besides those powerful places, are there any other half-demon beings?" Eilton suddenly asked.

"Oh, half-demon beings belong to extraterrestrial beings, so they will inherit the corresponding characteristics of extraterrestrial beings," Zhao Xu thought clearly at this moment.

"One of them is immortality."

Zhao Xu's expression changed suddenly. "Move these corpses out immediately."
