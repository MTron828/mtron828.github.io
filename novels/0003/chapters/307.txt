Chapter 308 Roaring Forum
The schedule for the next day remained calm and peaceful. 
In the evening, Zhao Xu and his group set up a small tent on the spot, and then a few of the core members entered it and untied the "lead box". 
In this way, the entire "notebook" slowly unfolded under the eyes of the high-level members of the "Guardians" guild. 
Compared to the first two notebooks, which more or less recorded the experiences of the mysterious tombs, this third notebook, which was passed down by the Erol family, did not record any previous tomb exploration experiences, nor did it record the mysterious symbols. It was obvious that the records of the ancestors had been deliberately erased by the owner of the mage tower and hidden elsewhere. 
The entire notebook detailed the contents of the mage tower. 
The only thing was that this notebook was divided into two parts. The first half described the hiding place of the mage tower and the specific way to enter it. 
But the second half, which detailed the various mechanisms of the tower and how to bypass them, as well as the structural distribution of the mage tower, was written in a special secret script. 
Zhao Xu needed to find the corresponding "key" to decipher it, and according to the book, the key was hidden in the mage tower. 
This meant that he had to enter the mage tower in order to continue reading. 
Zhao Xu knew that there must be something fishy about this arrangement, but he didn't say anything more. 
The group then made plans for the next day on a makeshift sand table. 
For safety reasons, Zhao Xu had the members of the Frost Sword and other guild members go offline one by one. As for himself, he also went offline after turning invisible.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu, who had just regained consciousness, found Zhang Qi intensely typing on the keyboard below, his mouth muttering curses.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked curiously as he walked down from the bed and stood behind Zhang Qi.

Logically, Zhang Qi should have been handling issues in Celestial Star Town, as he had recently been appointed as the leader of the security team, similar to Zhao Xu's previous life.

"This is too ridiculous," Zhang Qi said, furious. "As players, we've been killed by the NPCs and lost our chance to revive. What kind of ridiculous setting is this? We already had a hard time with the five revival stones, and now they're making things even harder for us."

Zhao Xu immediately understood the relevance to himself.

However, he didn't rush to express his opinions, instead sitting quietly on his chair, with the light from the laptop screen shining on his face.

In this era of nighttime entertainment, Zhao Xu's usual loud and crazy gaming voice was much quieter, with the sounds of crickets outside the balcony covering it.

Zhao Xu didn't take long to find the current hot topic on the forum, but his heart was already cold and sarcastic.

Unexpectedly, the four players who had died found that they couldn't revive and became furious, posting a rapid-fire post on the forum, taking advantage of Zhao Xu's inability to post a rebuttal on Earth. They splashed mud on him, saying that he couldn't do anything about it.

They also couldn't revive and made a difficult request to the planner at TC, demanding compensation.

Even Zhao Xu didn't expect that the "unrevivable" situation would hit a nerve with players.

When players discovered the "captive soul" in their previous life, they had already developed some strength and knew some countermeasures. It was difficult for new players to be defeated.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the beginning of the second month, Zhao Xu suddenly pulled out the "big killer" and complained to the four players about the "blood and tears" they had to endure. The phrase "not fair enough" resonated with the shared experience of "I might also encounter this situation", and like hot stones thrown into a pool of water, it suddenly sparked countless bubbles. Even Zhang Qi, Zhao Xu's roommate, felt a sense of indignation and wanted to stand with the four players to file a complaint.

However, Zhao Xu did not rush to write a post about everything that happened that day, nor did he deliberately respond to the main posts. Instead, he directly opened a word processor and started typing away. It took him more than an hour to finish writing the article.

At this point, he glanced at the forum and noticed that some titles had been pushed up. The posts included: "As a modern version of Dongguo Mr., I will speak out", "It's just the characteristic of some players", and "Some people are 'deserving of death'".

The four players ultimately failed to realize that Zhao Xu, as a representative of the Guardians' Guild, was speaking on behalf of the community. They refused to change their stance, even when they were screenshot as evidence of lying. When 40 other witnesses who witnessed the events during the day came forward to testify, especially those who had a certain reputation in Mistral, the entire forum suddenly understood that the four players were reaping what they had sown.

However, by that time, many high-ranking players who had already taken sides with the four players did not back down, and continued to insist that the game should not have such a brutal killing method.
Otherwise, everyone will use this method in the future, and there is no point in setting five resurrection stones. This has even exceeded the expectations of the four players, and more and more people are joining the forum as lurkers. The whole topic is debating whether Arthur should exist in this way of killing. With more points of contention, many advanced Arthur players have started to weigh in and express their opinions. Except for the mages, most advanced players believe that this setting is a mistake. This "one hit five" method is like a one-hit kill in a fighting game, leaving no room for regret, which naturally makes countless advanced players wary. At the same time, many players have started to mention @Dongcheng Ling to express their opinions. Over time, the mainstream opinion on the forum tends to be that Dongcheng Ling is a level 3 mage player. However, no one realized that Dongcheng Ling had already taken action. Zhao Xu did not intervene to refute, not because he didn't care, but because he needed to make a final decision. After rereading his entire post, Zhao Xu directly copied it to the main post on the forum and then lightly tapped "publish." Suddenly, many forum players who were still passionately debating in the main post received a flurry of notifications in their QQ group. At the same time, players who had set up "special alerts" and "super attention" on the forum all saw a pop-up box. For a moment, countless forum users following the account "Dongcheng Ling" saw the post they had made - "About the two types of ways and several methods of imprisoning and annihilating souls, signed: Dongcheng Ling."
The post briefly described two types of ways, one is an inescapable way - after being hit by spells such as the "Devil's Banquet" in the sixth circle, the "Decay Pouch Termination" in the ninth circle, and the "Soul Binding" in the ninth circle, the soul will never be able to resurrect.
The other type is to temporarily imprison the soul, but still have the option to choose suicide, which is soul restructuring for liberation. Specific methods include the "Soul Demon Pot" in the fifth circle, the "Soul Imprisonment Spell" in the eighth circle, "Soul Imprisonment Demon - Imprisoning the Original Body", and "Become an Undead Creature".
The specific details of the undead creature "Soul Imprisonment Demon" that sparked a lot of controversy on the forum have officially entered the players' sight with the introduction of the post.
The players whose souls were wiped out by Zhao Xu only found out at this time. Even if they were "imprisoned" by the "Soul Imprisonment Demon", they could still commit suicide.
It's just that they reacted too slowly at the time, or never made up their minds, and as a result, they kept delaying until the Soul Imprisonment Demon used five rounds to overdraw their souls as a form of spell energy.
Similarly, when a player dies and becomes an undead creature, the soul will remain inside the undead creature and cannot be resurrected, but they can still choose to commit suicide for "resurrection".
Because the resurrection stone is equivalent to the ninth circle's "complete resurrection spell", it can resurrect the undead, turning them back into living beings, otherwise a second circle priest who controls the dead bodies can easily take care of them.
Becoming an undead creature is at most just hanging around without resurrection, unlike the "Soul Imprisonment Demon", which, if not committed suicide within five rounds, will result in the annihilation of the soul.
So Zhao Xu essentially cut off all future avenues for the players in one fell swoop. They lost the possibility of using information gaps to see through five in the future like he did today.
However, this also allowed the high-level players to relax, as they ultimately have the "suicide" option as a way out.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoyu himself possesses a legendary soul-binding spell, specifically the "Soul Binding" spell, which targets corpses and absorbs the soul from the corpse and confines it within a gemstone. This spell explicitly states that all reviving spells will be ineffective, so even if a player attempts to revive themselves, their soul will be reassembled within the gemstone and cannot be revived in the temple.

Zhaoyu essentially takes advantage of his own situation, revealing all the secret methods for binding souls and directly leaving everyone with no way out. After the difficulty of binding souls is known, the heat of the entire forum has finally cooled down.

As a result, Zhaoyu's ID "Dong Cheng Li" has directly become extremely popular, and in the recent top 10 players list, "Dong Cheng Li" has surpassed the 5-level player "Xing Kong Dai Ying".

After completing these tasks, Zhaoyu takes a deep breath, but in reality, he knows that once the soul is bound, it will be a eternal price to pay. This is also the reason why Arthur, the wizard, has the ultimate threat against other professions.

Zhaoyu doesn't bother to respond to some players' suggestions on how he should improve. Instead, he takes out a piece of A3 paper from the bookshelf, draws a simple map of the surroundings of Mistral, and marks the location of the Mirror Lake, where the wizard tower is buried.

Suddenly, a flash of inspiration occurs to Zhaoyu, and he quickly marks the location of the summoning ritual of the alien creatures performed by Andy, the location of the buried second notebook tower, and the location where they emerged from the underground temple.
Even the location of the mysterious mansion that leads to the mine of the scavenger beast, the location of the underground stone chamber where the third notebook is placed.
After many locations were marked by Zhao Xu, he looked at the map, which was becoming more and more detailed and seemed to come to life. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he tightly grasped the edge of the paper, sighing, "So that's how it is!"
