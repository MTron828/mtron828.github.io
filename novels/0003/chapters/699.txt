Chapter 700: Victory Through Betting!

Zhou Xu has long since resigned himself to his upgraded state.
He can't rise too high or fall too low.
The mage system of the player, Arthur, can be described as blissful, as they have transcended the ordinary people of Arthur, who have spent over ten years in the "apprentice" system.
Moreover, they can determine their own innate talent points when creating an account, and obtain sufficient intelligence attributes.
In the player mage community, 16/17/18 intelligence points are commonplace, directly crushing the entire original mage group of Arthur.
Even 11 points can qualify someone to become an apprentice and learn to cast a single-ring spell, blocking the ordinary people of Arthur's vast territory.
However, when player mages cross into Arthur, the situation takes a turn.
The spells of the mage come from the bloodline, and the more they dig, the faster they can level up.
The spells of the priest come from the gods, and as long as they are favored, they will be elevated to a high position.
Believe that man determines his own fate, not the heavens. Our arcane is a group of mages who rely on learning, so there is no such luck.
Countless player mages have had to re-learn the original arcane knowledge system.
Although basic spells and casting poses can still be remembered in the brain, the "spell model" recorded in the spellbook will not change.
However, high school students who rely on self-study with "higher mathematics" to pass the entrance examination are still a minority.
The mage community has no chance of breaking through in this round, and it's not just a matter of a year or half a year.
Not to mention the wilderness of knowledge, where even food is scarce.
Here is the translation of the text:

The book that records magical knowledge only exists in the inventory of a wizard player, which is the starting point of the suffering of countless wizard players.

Although Zhao Xu managed to break through the 10th level by chance, it is still within the scope of the 5th circle.

Similarly, as a "Tome Scholar" who specializes in divine magic, he has not broken through the 5th circle, so he does not have a barrier to overcome.

Now, however, the 11th level, which represents the 6th circle, has knocked on his door.

He is only gambling with the devilish leader of the deep abyss.

Can he really make his wishes come true and make the entire abyssal plane bow to him?

What about the obstacles?
What about the barriers?

Just now, he killed two Balroth demons, but his internal life energy didn't change at all. Yet, he's directly levelling up to the 11th level after chatting with this devilish leader.

At this moment, Zhao Xu felt a little regret in his heart, as if he should have bet on whether he could become a god in the next second.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's character panel displayed all the data being comprehensively upgraded.

Even Zhao Xu had made up his mind, his "Level 3 Magic Guardian" was immediately unlocked without any delay.

However, the divine magic side was still stuck, with no clear route decided.

At this moment, Zhao Xu silently watched as his own character became a Level 3 Magic Guardian, gaining one of the most critical abilities of this profession - the ability to choose the target of a spell.

After special training, Magic Guardians can minimize indirect damage to themselves when casting combat spells.

For example, Zhao Xu can specify a particular species or subspecies when casting a spell, such as humans, and make them the only ones affected by the spell or unaffected by it.
Here is the translation of the text:

From then on, facing a chaotic situation where humans and earth spirits are at war, Zhao Xu can easily decide to deal damage to all the earth spirits present with his spell.

This ability can be used daily, with the number of times it can be used equal to Zhao Xu's intelligence bonus. However, he has the potential to recover at any time without any negative effects.

When he reaches level 5, this ability will be further enhanced, allowing him to target multiple species.

Just now, when he cast this ability, he directly targeted the "demon" and was able to attack a batch of them, without worrying about the innocent angel group being affected by the chaos of battle.

Moreover, using this ability is like getting an extra turn to manipulate the timing of casting spells.

However, it's not suitable for the current situation.

"What's going on?" the demon lord asked, with a smirk on his face, as if mocking Zhao Xu's lack of confidence.

"Nothing, I'm just preparing, don't mind it," Zhao Xu replied.

"Okay," the demon lord said, as if he wanted Zhao Xu to surrender, and his words became more conciliatory.

It's like in a casino, where when you feel you can win, you make more outrageous demands and the other party will always agree.

Zhao Xu also roughly guessed the demon lord's thoughts.

He was happy to go along with it, so Zhao Xu didn't say a word and directly cast the "Wall of Force" spell, creating a flat ground that could be stepped on, and a landing point in mid-air, saving him from having to rely on flying to get around.

On the other hand, Zhao Xu pulled out Howard's luxurious blanket from his backpack, didn't say a word, and lay down on it, silently preparing to recover his mana.
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, he had the ability to cast spells granted by the electorates, and at that time, he was chosen as the "Anti-Demon King". However, the goddess Sylvia, who was also accused of being a troublemaker by the various leaders of the underworld, or countless gods who coveted the position representing "magic".

This was one of the most prestigious positions held by King Arthur, and every magic goddess was undoubtedly one of the strongest forces.

"I have enough patience, you sleep for eight hours and prepare the spell," the demon king suddenly shouted loudly, looking at Zhao Xuan with a menacing expression.

Zuo Xuan, however, didn't take him seriously, and instead chose to take a nap, with the remaining 7 hours spent gazing at the beautiful scenery of the underworld.

In this way, Zhao Xuan inadvertently gained 7 precious hours.

However, as time went on, he started to feel a sense of unease.

During this period, Zhao Xuan silently opened the "True Knowledge" spell, trying to observe if there were any secret biological entities lurking around.

But all he found was nothing.

The demon king, who had been watching Zhao Xuan all along, looked like a saintly warrior who kept his promise, and the entire process didn't bother him at all.

"I can only vaguely sense that something is amiss, but how did you do it?"

Zuo Xuan was accumulating strength, waiting for the six-ring spell to arrive, while also pondering where the mistake was.

"Oh, I'm quite curious, how did you discover the problem?"

The demon king said with a smile.

"I'm just too smart."

"In the underworld, those who are too smart often get into trouble."
Here is the translation of the text:

It was obvious that the demon lord had already suffocated the last shred of hope from Zhao Xu's desperate attempt to turn the tables.

Zhao Xu suddenly furrowed his brows.

"Have we completed the contract?"

"No mistake, Mystera's magical education is indeed excellent, and even a six-ring mage can attain such a level," the abyssal lord said, already addressing Zhao Xu as a six-ring mage.

It was clear that he had reached the level of a six-ring mage.

Moreover, it was also certain that he might not be able to quickly grasp the "anti-magic zone" of a six-ring mage.

Zhao Xu thought to himself.

However, the next second, he suddenly entered a state of unparalleled clarity.

It was as if he had heard a call from the depths of ancient times, a call that seemed to come from the edge of his ear.

His true name!

The opponent already knew he came from Mystera.

However, what they wanted was his true name!

Zhao Xu knew that many abyssal demons possessed their own true names.

Even if one knew the true names of these demons, one could gain significant advantages when casting spells like expelling or binding spells.

Some families who worshipped demons also relied on true names in their practice.

But did humans have true names too?

If they did, evil mages would have already used them to enslave magical apprentices and squeeze out all their value, so why would they let them go easily?

No.

Zhao Xu realized he had been misled.

He had directly experienced the history of Grazzit and Diomago, which had misled him!

At that time, they had descended upon Arthur's power, which was extremely limited, and this was also the reason why abyssal lords needed to develop followers, deceive innocent humans, and use them for their own purposes.

No matter how many resources the abyssal lords had at home, they could not withstand such a long and arduous journey.
At this moment, he is finally face to face with a demon lord.

As long as he stays in contact with this demon lord for a while, he will be able to exert a subtle and insidious influence over him.

Even if he wins the bet in the next round, he can cause irreparable damage.

"What will happen if I lose?" Zhao Xu suddenly regained his composure and asked.

"Not a thing."

This demon lord from the depths laughed, "I'll just find out your true name and turn you into a demon."

You demon lords are really lacking in creativity.

Zhao Xu smirked and sat down on the ground, pulling out a "Counter-Magic" scroll, preparing to record it into his mind.

The ability of the Wisdom Scholar continued to exert its key effects.

As long as Zhao Xu did not pretend to use the scroll, this demon lord did not intend to intervene, silently observing Zhao Xu's actions.

"Saying that Wisdom Scholar is rare, I've never seen anyone who doesn't choose this ability after the Great Disaster," he said, asking, "How is the young lady doing?"

But Zhao Xu had already made up his mind not to answer, continuing to disassemble the remaining parts of the spell model.

Thanks to Anniya's initial lessons, he had truly absorbed the entire spell system from the ground up, understanding the principles.

It was not just memorizing a single "A" key.

Although Zhao Xu had learned nineteen models of magic tricks at the time, he had a solid foundation.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he knew he would be crossing over, and with his intellect fully developed, he was also very sincere in his pursuit of magic. At this point, there was not much difficulty, and he slowly completed the entire spell transcription.

After an hour of preparation, Zhao Xu slapped his buttocks and stood up.

He looked at the list of spell slots on his body and couldn't help but sigh, "Mages are indeed pitiful."

As a 29-intelligence, six-ring mage, he had one profession and one intelligence bonus, totaling two six-ring spell slots.

The five-ring spell, on the other hand, had two professions and two intelligence bonuses, totaling four.

He thought about the days when he used to cast five-ring spells effortlessly, and how he couldn't have done it without the support of his innate abilities.

Zhao Xu glanced at the "six-ring" anti-magic zone spell slot he had prepared in his mind and nodded slightly.

In reality, mages cast spells in the process of preparing spells every day, and the actual casting process was just the last step of the hour-long preparation. Only a few people could accomplish this.

"I'm ready," Zhao Xu said.

The demon lord chuckled and nodded slightly, "I'll give you one minute, and if you can cast it, you win."

"That's it," he said, and the oppressive pressure of the abyssal will spread through the air.

Zhao Xu's entire body seemed to be shaken by a massive tremor.

Through the influence of focused spellcasting!

Could he not cast a six-ring spell?

Zhao Xu didn't expect the demon lord to feel so distant from the divine, and yet he wanted to play this small trick.

But he was who he was.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu quietly absorbed the 16-point lucky charm and focused it on his "Concentration" skill, which was also enhanced by the "Skill Amplification" spell targeting his "Concentration" skill.

In an instant, Zhao Xu calmly endured the shock and completed the spellcasting action of the "Reverse Curse"!

However, just as Zhao Xu was smiling, the space suddenly turned dull!

All magical energy disappeared, and everything became nothing.

Including Zhao Xu's magical items, even the force field he was standing on, all lost their effectiveness.

The Great Sage's robe lost its foundation, and the crimson glow became dim. The +5xx longsword in his hand was crushed, becoming a mere ordinary longsword worth a few gold coins.

Originating from magic, destroyed by magic.

This is the "Reverse Curse" of the Overlord of the Abyss!
As long as his Reverse Curse covers Zhao Xu, Zhao Xu will be unable to cast spells and lose all his magical abilities, including the "Classical Magic" ability granted by Mistral.

This is the Overlord's setup from the beginning!

It's not the key to victory, but rather the trigger to release.

However, Zhao Xu smiled slightly and drew his sword across.

At this moment, although he was falling, he felt no fear.

Because he had intentionally used the Reverse Curse.

This demon lord has tasted defeat. How can he not learn from his mistake?

"Iron Heart Force!"

The next moment, the familiar magical energy returned to himself.

Zhao Xu quietly completed the final spellcasting action.

"Reverse Curse."
From Zhao Xu's Reverse Curse.
