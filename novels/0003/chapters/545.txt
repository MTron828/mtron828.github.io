Chapter 546: Free Magic Constant Spell

King Congwei's words were simple, meaning Zhao Xueli should compile a priority list of people to be sent. However, what lay behind was for Zhao Xueli to assume the role of a supreme deity, determining the fate of humans on Earth.

This was not only an unparalleled "power" but also an unbearable "responsibility". He could not decide who would die, but he could decide who would get the "safe quota" first, allowing the other person to survive. It was like when disasters struck, the first to evacuate would get the "precious quota", while those left behind might not die but would face risks.

When humans from previous Earth arrived, the desolate land was almost like a ruin, with buildings and living facilities starting from scratch. Moreover, the problem of food supply was crucial.

Even with the support of powerful forces from various countries, under the will of the benevolent gods, it was still difficult to satisfy the food needs of 7 billion people. Famine, a word often seen in "history books", would once again become a harsh reality for everyone.

Soil, though lacking nutrition, could temporarily alleviate "hunger pangs".

In the game, players could use the "dimension bag" or transport food from afar, instantly becoming the favorite of the group.

However, in the previous scene, those who received immediate care were mostly game players' family members, with those with exceptional abilities later expanding to include Earth humans who could become professionals.

According to the thoughts of the benevolent goddesses, everyone should live equally. However, in the end of days, all Earth humans who crossed over were marked with an invisible scale of their own weight.
Here is the translation:

This was also the initial period of crossing, an era of unparalleled chaos, where the "iron law" that was effective in the past was still in effect.

Zhao Xu let out a sigh and said, "You decide."

"What?" Wang Qingwei looked surprised.

Strictly speaking, the capacity of the alliance territory was also limited. The towns surrounding the wilderness on the periphery had already blocked all roads at the initial crossing period.

If they were to open up, the instant influx of refugees would make it impossible to provide a large number of jobs for them to work in exchange for food.

Moreover, their consumption would instantly cause a city to collapse.

It was for this reason that Zhao Xu, as the lord of the Falling Star Town, could suppress the opinions of the people and accept refugees.

This was the reason why the portal could only take effect in the Falling Star Town.

Zhao Xu silently walked into the wooden hut and stood in front of a large, two-meter-long, and 1.5-meter-wide sheepskin map, which depicted the terrain within a 100-kilometer radius of the Falling Star Town in three or four colors of ink.

Combined with Zhao Xu's "Territory Perception" technique and feedback from various adventurers in recent times, this detailed map of the town had been successfully created.

Zhao Xu pointed to the empty land outside the town and said, "The Falling Star Town should also become the Falling Star City. These new arrivals will be a great supplement."

"What do you plan to do with the Earth people?" Wang Qingwei finally realized Zhao Xu's intention.

"Not the Earth will forever be its own," Zhao Xu said.

"These early-growing players will be lost to other forces if they are allowed to leave. It would be a pity."
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, because the Northern Alliance is relatively close to the landing site, these forces have seen the chaotic situation on Earth and have brought their families back to the "alliance". Later, when Wang Congwei established the entire framework, those who missed the initial establishment couldn't go back, feeling like they had parted ways with the "Earth forces", similar to the identity of overseas Chinese.

Zhou Xu naturally wouldn't allow this to happen, and viewed the Starfall Town as an outpost of Earth. "Make a list first," Zhou Xu ordered.

Wang Congwei was naturally not writing down specific personnel, but only listing certain "personnel conditions". Later, he would arrange for these people to pass through the transmission portal to Starfall Town, which was also a protection for them.

As for Zhou Xu's relatives and friends, his "transmission technique" didn't require money and could be activated at any time.

"Ah, Hongxia, since you have already reached the fifth ring, have you considered the Magic Constant Spell?" Wang Congwei asked Zhou Xu, looking at him.

Zhou Xu's heart skipped a beat as he suddenly remembered the spell he had been thinking about since he read the magical scriptures. Back then, he could only read magic for one to two hours, but now, as a level-1 spellcaster, he could make a "reading magic" last for several days.

The Magic Constant Spell itself wouldn't create any extraordinary effects in the Arthurian world, but its target is another spell. In other words, it can make some designated spells permanent.

This is more powerful than "spell preservation" and has a longer-lasting effect.

However, the Magic Constant Spell also has a "price" that needs to be paid.
Here is the translation:

This is immense life energy!
Using the constant magic spell frequently will only lead to a delayed upgrade, and possibly even a level down.
Instantly, Zhao Xu's mind brought up the details of the "Wisdom Magic" ability.
"It seems you're also preparing to use it," Wang Congwei said. "However, there's one issue: the constant magic spell takes 2 rounds to cast."
"While your 'Supernatural Magic' ability can exempt you from paying life energy to cast the spell, however——"
As Wang Congwei spoke, she furrowed her brow. "I remember that the usage condition of Supernatural Magic is that the spell cannot exceed the 'standard action' time, otherwise it cannot be used."
"So, I wonder if there's a solution. For example, the 'Selective Magic' ability of the Magic Guardian can release the spell to a 'standard action' time, even for 1-hour level spells, which can be shortened to 1 round, but still not satisfying the standard action time."
Facing Wang Congwei's troubled expression, Zhao Xu couldn't help but shake his head with a smile. "Don't worry, when the resources are overpowered, all problems will be easily solved."
Zhao Xu's "Multitalented Mage" naturally follows the spellcasting time. He just solved the spell problem.
However, he has the "Precognitive" specialty.
"I can use my Precognitive spell to solve this problem. Within the scope of familiar spells, the spells I select without recording will all be standard actions. As for those outside the scope, they will be whole-round actions."
Zhao Xu's proficiency in magic is not superficial, and he can directly pinpoint the core of the problem.

The flaw in Zhao Xu's choice of specialization lies in his excessive reliance on magic, which allows him to choose spells equivalent to his intelligence score without needing a spellbook, and he can still prepare spells even if he loses his spellbook. This is meaningless for Zhao Xu, who has the profession ability "Wise Mage".

However, this specialization is a prerequisite for the "Precognition" ability, and Zhao Xu can abandon up to a number of spell slots equal to his intelligence score (7) to cast spells spontaneously.

In the past, Zhao Xu relied more on the "Multiclass Mage" to achieve spontaneous casting.

It was only after he gained the potential points that he could focus on recovering abandoned spell slots, and the power of this specialization was amplified.

More importantly, this spell can convert "casting cost" spells that exceed the standard action time into "standard action casting" spells, perfectly compatible with the "Super Natural Magic" ability of the Shield of the Order.

As a 1st-level specialization, Zhao Xu's achievement finally bears fruit at level 9.

In this instant, Zhao Xu deeply felt the machinations of Anzhi Niyag for him.

Needless to say, few spells require high-level materials and exceed standard action time, and even fewer require both. Therefore, Zhao Xu's proficiency in magic is sufficient to cover the number of spells.

Understood, Zhao Xu directly opened his backpack and took out the spellbook records of "Abandon Chaos" and "Return to Chaos", using his current spellcaster level, even if he uses a 9th-level scroll without risk of failure.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as the energy from the scroll's magic was absorbed, it began to seep into Zhao Xu's body, tightly wrapping itself around him. Before the "Familiarity with Magic" skill had barely had time to dissipate, Zhao Xu seamlessly connected to the "Chaos Reversal" magic. In front of Wang Qingwei, he slowly detached his own chaotic energy.

The "Familiarity with Magic" skill returned, but the familiar magic was reselected by Zhao Xu and infused with new vitality.

"You feel like a descendant of the Abyss, with a sense of depth that's almost palpable," Wang Qingwei said, while Zhao Xu thought to himself that the Eight-Ring Magic was indeed extraordinary.

At the same time, Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

Currently, he had nothing in his hands, but it was also a manifestation of his innate abilities.

The potential points resolved the issues of learning skills and magic positions.

The supernatural magic resolved the issues of magic resistance and material problems.

The super-magical control resolved the issues of super-magical costs.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had reached a state of perfect closure, capable of facing any challenge that came his way with his bare hands.

Zhao Xu was clear that there were three types of constant magic applications.

The first type was specified magic, which could be constant on oneself, such as the secret vision of the eye of the abyss.

The second type was specified magic, which could be constant on oneself, other living beings, or objects; for example, human transformation magic.

The third type was specified magic, which could be constant on objects or areas, such as the magical alarm.

Additionally, there were three fundamental conditions for constant magic.

The first was that the caster had a specified magic on their person.

The second was that the caster had the corresponding skill level required by the magic, such as the 11th-level skill required for the secret vision of the eye of the abyss.
Here is the translation:

"Three possesses sufficient life energy. At this moment, he is going to fix all first-class and second-class spells to himself. Zhao Xu, at this moment, starts to enter the 'unusual person mode'."

Note: The term "不当人模式" (bù dāng rén mó shì) is likely a fictional concept and may not have a direct translation. The phrase "unusual person mode" is an attempt to convey the meaning in a way that is easy to understand.
