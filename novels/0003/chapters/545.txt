Chapter 546: Free Magic Constant Spell

King Congwei's words were simple, meaning that Zhao Xueli was to submit a priority list for transportation. However, behind the scenes, Zhao Xueli was actually being asked to take on the role of a supreme deity, deciding the fate of human life and death on Earth.

This was not just an extraordinary "power," but also an unbearable "responsibility." He could not decide who would die, but could determine who would receive the "safe quota" first. This way, the other party could enjoy a life of comfort and security.

It was like when a disaster strikes, and the first to evacuate are those with the "precious quota," while those left behind may not necessarily die, but are facing a great risk.

When humans from Earth descended upon the planet in the past, the desolate land was comparable to a wasteland, with buildings and various living arrangements all starting from scratch.

Moreover, the issue of food supply was the most critical.

Even with the support of various powerful forces surrounding them, guided by the will of the benevolent gods, it was still difficult to satisfy the food needs of 7 billion people.

Famine, a word that many people had only read about in "history books," was once again rekindled in everyone's stomach.

Soil, although lacking in nutrients, could temporarily alleviate the feeling of hunger.

In the game, players could use "dimension bags" or transport food from afar, immediately becoming the favorite of the group.

However, in the past scenes, those who received immediate care were mostly the game players' relatives, and later expanded to include Earth humans with exceptional abilities who could become professionals.

According to the thinking of the benevolent mothers, everyone should live equally.

However, in the end times, all Earth humans who crossed over were marked with an invisible scale, weighing their own "personal weight."
Here is the translation:

This was also the initial stage of crossing, an era of unparalleled chaos where the "iron rule" was still effective. Zhao Xu then let out a sigh, "You decide."

"What?" Wang Qingwei looked astonished.

Strictly speaking, the capacity of the alliance territory was also limited. The towns surrounding the border of the wilderness had sealed off all roads at the initial stage of crossing. This was because if they were opened, refugees would flood into the city, and it would be impossible to provide a large number of jobs for them to earn their living. Moreover, their consumption would cause the city to collapse instantly.

That's why Zhao Xu, as the lord of the town, could override everyone's opinions and accept refugees. This was the reason why the teleportation gate could only be effective in the town of Jiuxing.

At this moment, Zhao Xu quietly walked into the wooden house, where a large map of the town's surroundings, measuring two meters by 1.5 meters, was spread out before him. The map was drawn with three to four colors of ink, detailing the entire town's terrain.

Combining this map with Zhao Xu's "Terrain Perception" skill and feedback from various adventurers in recent times, the current town map was successfully completed.

Zhao Xu pointed to the vacant land outside the town, "Jiuxing Town should also become Jiuxing City. Those new arrivals will be a great supplement."

"Are you planning to let the Earth people enter the Northern Alliance?" Wang Qingwei finally realized Zhao Xu's intentions.

"No, the Earth will always be its own Earth."

"These early-growing players would be too pitiful to lose to other forces," Zhao Xu said.
Here is the translation:

In reality, because the northern alliance was relatively closer to the descent site among the major powers, their original players, who saw the chaotic situation on Earth, became disillusioned and brought their families back to the "alliance". Later, after Wang Qingwei supported the entire structure for a year or two, those who missed the initial establishment also found it difficult to return, feeling a sense of estrangement similar to that of overseas Chinese people. Naturally, Zhao Xu would not tolerate this situation, and viewed the Starfall as an extension of Earth. "Draft the list first," Zhao Xu instructed. Wang Qingwei's draft would not be a specific list of personnel, but rather a list of personnel conditions. They would arrange for these people to come to Starfall through the portal, which would also serve as protection for them. As for Zhao Xu's family and friends, his "portation spell" didn't require payment and could be activated at any time. "Right, Zhongxia, since you've already reached the fifth circle, have you considered the Magic Constant Spell?" Wang Qingwei asked Zhao Xu. Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat as he suddenly recalled the spell he had studied when reading the magical tome. At the time, he could only sustain the spell for one to two hours, and he was always laughing at his "magical reading" ability to sustain it for an extended period. Who would have thought that his "magical reading" ability had improved so much. Now, relying on his caster level, he could sustain a spell for several days. The Magic Constant Spell itself would not create any extraordinary effects in the Arthurian world, but its target was another spell. In other words, it could permanently fix some designated spells. This was even more powerful and long-lasting than the "Spell of Endurance". However, the Magic Constant Spell also had a "price" that needed to be paid.
Here is the translation:

"This is immense life energy!

Frequent use of the Constant Spell will only lead to delayed leveling up, and even a drop in level. Instantly, Zhao Xiu's mind "Hui Xin Shi Fa" ability brought up the details of this spell.

"It seems you are also preparing to use it," Wang Qingwei said. "However, there is currently a problem - the casting time of the Constant Spell is 2 rounds."

"While your 'Supernatural Spell' ability can exempt the need for material payment and allow you to cast the Constant Spell without consuming life energy, however -"

As Wang Qingwei frowned, she remembered that the use of Supernatural Spell was conditional on the spell not exceeding the 'standard action' time, otherwise it cannot be used.

"So I wonder if there is a solution. Like the 'Selective Spell' ability of the Spell Guard, it fixes the spell to a single 'standard action' time, even for a 1-hour spell, which can be shortened to 1 round, but still does not meet the standard action time."

Facing Wang Qingwei's troubled expression, Zhao Xiu couldn't help but shake his head with a smile, "Don't worry, when resources are oversupplied, all problems will become easy to solve."

Zhao Xiu's "Multitalented Spellcaster" naturally followed the standard spellcasting time, it just solved the spell problem.

However, he has a specialty in "Precognition".

"I can use the Precognition Spell to solve this problem. When the spell is familiar, those I select from the memory of the spellbook are all 'standard actions'. However, those outside the range are 'full-round actions'."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's proficiency in magic is not mediocre, and he can directly point to the core of the issue.

The flaw in Zhao Xu's choice of "magical aptitude" allows him to choose spells equivalent to his intelligence modifier without the need for a spellbook, and he can still respond in an emergency even if he loses the spellbook.

However, it is meaningless for Zhao Xu, who has the profession skill "Wisdom Channel", to have this flaw.

However, this flaw is a prerequisite for the key skill "Precognition", which allows Zhao Xu to vacate a spell slot equal to his intelligence modifier (7) and use the spell without a spellbook.

In the past, Zhao Xu has mostly used the skill "Multiclass Channel" to implement self-casting.

It was not until he got the talent point that the power of this flaw began to rise.

More importantly, this spell can convert "spellcasting cost" into a "standard action" spell, perfectly adapting to the "Supernatural Magic" ability of the "Divine Shield" profession.

As a 1st-level skill mastered by Zhao Xu, it finally bears fruit at level 9.

In this moment, Zhao Xu deeply felt the depth of Anzhi's scheme.

The spells that require high-level spell materials are already scarce, and those that exceed the standard action time are even scarcer.

So, Zhao Xu's magical proficiency is sufficient to cover them.

After understanding this, Zhao Xu directly opened his backpack and took out the spellbook records "Abandon Chaos" and "Return to Chaos", and with his current spellcaster level, he can use the scroll even without a spellbook, with no risk of failure.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as the energy from the scroll was absorbed, it began to seep into Zhao Xusheng's body, tightly wrapping itself around him. Before the "Familiar with Magical Arts" specialization had even had time to fade, Zhao Xusheng seamlessly connected himself to the "Avoid Chaos" spell. In front of Wang Qingwei, he slowly detached his chaotic energy from his body.

The "Familiar with Magical Arts" specialization returned, but the familiar spell was reselected by Zhao Xusheng, adding vitality to the spell once again. "You feel like a descendant of the abyss, with a profound sense of the abyss. Not even the demonic beings from the abyssal plane have given me such a strong sense of unease," Wang Qingwei said.

Zhaoyu smiled wryly, thinking to himself that the eight-ring spell was indeed exceptional. At the same time, he took a deep breath. Now, he had nothing in his hands, but this was a manifestation of his innate abilities. The latent potential solved the problems of specialization and spell slots. Supernatural spells solved the problems of spell resistance and spell materials. Super-magic control solved the problems of super-magic costs.

At this moment, Zhao Xusheng had reached a perfect cycle, capable of handling any problem that came his way. Zhao Xusheng was clear that there were three types of spells in the Constant Magic spell: the first type was a designated spell that could be constant on oneself, such as the secret vision spell. The second type was a designated spell that could be constant on oneself, other living beings, or objects, such as the human transformation spell. The third type was a designated spell that could be constant on objects or regions, such as the magical alarm.

There were also three major prerequisites for constant spells: one was that the spell was currently on the caster's body. The second was that the caster had the required spell level, such as the 11th level required for the secret vision spell.
Here is the translation:

"Three has enough life energy.
At this moment, he is about to fix all the first-class and second-class spells on himself.
Zhao Xu, at this moment, begins to enter the "unnatural human mode"."

Note: The text appears to be describing a fictional scene in a fantasy story, where the character Zhao Xu is gaining power and entering a new state.
