Chapter 52: Dispelling the Undead

Looking at Zhao Xu's puzzled expression, Deacon Sosa gently placed his lacquerware cup down and said, "Don't you think you're just lucky?"

Zhao Xu shook his head, and, with a hint of embarrassment, acknowledged his special circumstances.

"Don't worry," Deacon Sosa consoled, as if sensing Zhao Xu's wariness. "Don't worry about it. This guy is an old acquaintance of mine. He didn't have the aptitude to become a mage, so he became a pastor. I, on the other hand, was fortunate enough to become a nine-ring mage."

A nine-ring mage is someone who can cast level nine spells, at least 17th level in terms of magecraft, which is reflected on their badge.

Zhao Xu turned to look at Deacon Sosa, who had already reached middle age and had gray hair. On the other hand, Lei An, who was barely in his thirties, couldn't help but sigh inwardly. It seemed that high-ranking clergy couldn't sustain their lives as freely as mages.

However, thinking about it, those devout pastors believed that arriving at the divine realm earlier, accompanied by the divine, and ascending to become an angel, was perhaps a better choice.

"Actually, your situation is a variation of the pastor," Deacon Sosa said.

Hearing the word "variation", Lei An couldn't help but glance at Zhao Xu.

"Is that what you mean by the monastic pastor?" Zhao Xu whispered.

"No mistake," Deacon Sosa replied. "Arthur, everything is connected by its own thread. Your advancement direction has been drawn towards the monastic pastor direction, and it's not just a simple addition of a new field."

"What's the cost?" Zhao Xu continued to ask.

As someone who had obtained the ability to cast spells with wisdom, he had already anticipated the additional abilities he would gain.
Here is the translation of the text:

The potential of a clergyman is limited, and if one aspect is allocated more, another aspect will be allocated less. Otherwise, everyone would have gone in the same direction long ago.

"Compared to ordinary priests, monastic priests have reduced military training and increased research and prayer," said Bishop Sosis, who then walked over to a bookshelf in the reception room.

Zhao Xun finally understood a bit.

As a clergyman, it's not like they're hiding behind the scenes like a wet nurse. They have their own divine powers, which can also enhance themselves, making them a powerful war machine.

During the Seal of God War, Zhao Xun had already seen the priests charge forward, taking up the hammer and facing off against the evil creatures from the other side. Compared to mages who wear heavy armor, priests have a lower failure rate due to their reliance on divine powers, and they don't need to wear heavy armor.

So, the priest who abandoned martial arts and took up literature is also a relatively suitable choice for a double elite profession.

At this point, Bishop Sosis had already taken out an ancient tome and walked over to hand it to him.

"This is the biography of the previous Pope, Nia's Crown, who was also a monastic priest. You can read this book in the future to understand the characteristics of this variant priesthood profession."

Zhao Xun respectfully accepted the book, briefly flipping through it before closing it again and continuing to listen to the other person's explanation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Generally speaking, monks are disciplined and rarely chaotic. Additionally, due to their unique knowledge, they can obtain an 'expertise' and a special ability called 'learning', which is similar to the 'gossip' ability of a wandering poet. This will be clear later."

"What are the disadvantages?" asked Zhao Xu, a rational thinker, who was more concerned about the benefits and costs.

"If the price is too high, he won't change his mind and will still complain about it."

"The life value of a priest is D8, while a monk's is only D6. Moreover, a monk can only master simple weapons and light armor."

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and nodded slightly.

"That's roughly what I understand," he said.

"Let's get to the point," said the Archdeacon, looking at Zhao Xu. "Do you know what ability I'm going to guide you to master next?"

Just as Zhao Xu was about to shake his head to indicate he didn't know, a sudden thought flashed in his mind.

In their previous life, whenever they encountered a ghost, they would often find a priest who could directly suppress the ghost's power.

He remembered that the ability was called "Dispelling and Destroying Undead" or "Exorcising Undead" by the evil priest.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

In the past, when he was fighting against Anniya's small skeleton warrior, he was busy dodging and weaving, relying on the opponent's low life value to complete the one-hit kill.

If he had this ability from the start, he might have been able to directly suppress it at the time.
Here is the translation of the text:

The benevolent priest can use the power of the "Holy Seal" to dispel or destroy undead creatures. The evil priest, on the other hand, is one who criticizes and commands. After saying this, the Archbishop of the Lord handed him a Holy Seal and said, "This is the Holy Seal I used to possess. Now, I give it to you."

Zhao Xu took the Holy Seal gently, and on its surface was the six-pointed star symbol of the goddess, which was vivid and lifelike. On the back was the name of the Archbishop of the Lord. Above it was inscribed the phrase "Knowledge and wisdom are always present."

Rein, who was standing beside him, looked at the scene silently, with a hint of a smile on his face. Zhao Xu knew that this was a manifestation of the Archbishop of the Lord's friendship towards him.

A priest's Holy Seal, which he had carried for several decades, was not something simple. With this Holy Seal, even if he was not a priest, he could freely pass through the Archbishop's diocese in the future. Even the "Resurrection of the Dead" and more powerful resurrection magic that he had long coveted might become possible. This Holy Seal represented the Archbishop of the Lord's friendship towards him.

Zhao Xu had thought that the blue star's influence and interests had already become complex enough. But in this reception room, the head of the goddess's temple and the Archbishop of the Lord were openly showing their friendship towards him, a person who was not even a first-level priest. The Archbishop of the Lord was willing to make such a direct investment, even if it was just a token.

The goddess's priest could not do something as reckless as crossing a river by feeling, and would even acknowledge the cost. Perhaps there were some things behind this that he had not thought of. Zhao Xu had previously thought that these priests were so benevolent and had such deep emotions.

As Zhao Xu hesitated, the Archbishop of the Lord did not speak up, and instead showed a satisfied expression. Sowing a tree, the best time is either ten years ago or now.
Here is the translation of the text:

He continued to say, "As a pastor, we can use this ability three times a day, plus our charm adjustment value." After saying this, he handed two books to Zhao Xuan. "These are our church's textbooks, as well as my notes on this ability over the years. You can take a look."

Zhao Xuan took one and looked at it, and the book title was "Dispelling and Destroying Undead Beings, the Path of a Pastor". The other book was the notes of the Archbishop of the Underworld.

He smiled wryly to himself, feeling that even as a pastor, he couldn't escape the fate of reading books.

However, he had previously set his charm to 13 points, with 1 point of adjustment, and now he could finally use it.

In other words, he had four opportunities a day to use the ability to dispel or destroy undead beings.

"Is that it?" Rayan asked, turning his head to the side.

"What is it?" Zhao Xuan didn't react.

"Your dispelling ability?" Rayan asked again.

Zhao Xuan suddenly fell silent, thinking that this was a bunch of nonsense. He hadn't even opened the books yet.

Zhao Xuan glanced at his character card and was about to record the content when his eyes suddenly froze.

Could it really be true?
