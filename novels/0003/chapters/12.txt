Chapter 13: Intelligence Ceiling

"'This mage profession is just for fun, right? You're making me recite incantations without even asking? If I don't, you'll kick me out?'"

"' Same here, but you need to pass an emotional evaluation. You're not here to play games, you're being played by the game.'"

"'I've listened to the lecture for 10 minutes, and I've already given up. What a waste of my 18 intelligence points, deleted the character and remade it as a force-sensitive warrior.'"

"'I'm a druid profession, still lost in the forest, and I'm not a ranger, can I get a strategy from someone below?'"

"'The seniors upstairs have already explained the incantation, but I'm still having trouble finding the local mage association in the village. The NPCs in the village don't even know me, and they're ignoring me.'"

"'Did the upper level just spawn in the wrong location? I suggest you look at the map behind us. According to what I know, villages won't have mage associations. Maybe you should go to the town above instead. However, I don't recommend it.'"

"'Why?'"

"'Because I just left the village and got ambushed by a few goblins on the way to the town, and it really hurts. The system even told me I have 1 revival stone left, and I only have 4 left after looking at the number.'"

"'No mistake, congratulations, you still have 4 revival chances before your character dies.'"

"'This game feels too hardcore for me, and it's been two hours since the server opened, and no one has been able to complete the profession training and start hunting.'"

"'According to what I know, a certain game decided not to continue investing resources in this game after a trial play, considering the harsh requirements of this game do not conform to the current mainstream, and it's unlikely to have significant potential.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can someone tell me why I'm being kicked out of the faith because I think the teachings are outdated? Those priests say I'm a heretic and now I have to find a new job."

"Seriously, players without PTSD, go straight to the 16-point strength warrior and you'll be fine. Other jobs will take a few days to get going."

"Run? Are you kidding me? We're just sitting quietly in class, learning the mysterious arts of this game. I'm dying laughing. Just when I thought I was leveling up my faith, I'm out."

At this time, most players are still in the game and unable to post on the forum.

However, some players who have already decided to quit or die unexpectedly have logged off to vent their frustrations.

The forum is hot, with a new peak reached after the game opened at 8pm.

Players are all confused, wondering when they can start killing monsters or completing quests to get rewards.

Can't they at least let us use our initial skills?

Even the most terrible action games give us some starting equipment.

As for Zhao Xuyu, he is struggling with his studies.

He glanced at the silent sorceress standing in front of the desk, her robe a bit too big, making it hard to see her figure.

Annie's detective skills are certainly not low, and Zhao Xuyu didn't even glance at her for more than three seconds before she turned her head and looked at him.

This time, Zhao Xuyu finally caught a glimpse of her dark brown eyes, the same as his own.

"What's the problem?"
Here is the translation:

Arthas's attributes can be quantified, and it's no secret to the locals. Let alone someone like Anis Noir, who is undoubtedly a level 10 or above mage.

Attributes are layered, and each time they are upgraded, a significant improvement can be felt.

When Anis Noir heard Zhao Xu's question, she simply nodded slightly and said, "You have 11 intelligence points, which is enough."

"Are you not joking, teacher?" Zhao Xu asked.

Arthas is a mage who specializes in casting spells, and to cast an X-level spell, he needs to have at least 10 + X attribute points.

Zhao Xu has 16 intelligence points and will not be able to upgrade his intelligence. He can only cast a sixth-level spell.

To cast a ninth-level spell, he needs to increase his intelligence to 19 points.

Because he doesn't have this intelligence, he can't understand those incantations.

11 intelligence points are just enough to meet the requirements for a first-level spell.

Zhao Xu is not the most talented, but he knows that Anis Noir's words imply that there is room for improvement.

Every four levels, he can upgrade his attributes, and Zhao Xu is not worried about his 16 intelligence points reaching 19.

However, mages won't be bothered by intelligence.

The extra spell slots brought by intelligence are essential for mages who are short on spell slots.

Newbie mages often run out of spells quickly.

Unless they kill a monster in one or two hits, their spells will barely last.

In general, people look at new mages as someone who quickly runs out of spells and then stands in the corner, fanning themselves with a hand fan.

Mages are weak in combat, and monsters are almost impossible to hit.

If they stand still, their teammates will worry that they might be knocked down by the monster.

"You guess how many intelligence points I have. If the difference is not more than 5 points, I'll give you a gift that's worth a lot."

Zhao Xu looked calmly at Anis Noir at this time.
At the beginning, he attached great importance to attribute distribution because attributes were too difficult to obtain. For example, he had a waist belt from his previous life that could add +2 strength, so unless he obtained equipment that could add +4 strength, he had already reached a dead end in terms of attribute acquisition from equipment.

Equipment provides an enhancement value, and the same-named value does not stack.

According to rumors, only a few top-tier warriors above level 10 have seen such magic items that add +6 attributes, reaching the attribute cap.

So, Anzhiya's attributes can be estimated.

This is also transparent for Arthur, who knows the attributes and levels, and it's easy to calculate how many spell slots Anzhiya has.

Zhao Xu thought to himself: I admire your 18 intelligence, a unique attribute at the start.

You're young, and as a 12th-level mage, you should be a rare case, with just three attribute increases, making your total intelligence 18 + 3 = 21 points.

If you add the legendary hat that adds +6 intelligence enhancement value, it would be 27 points of intelligence, which is already overwhelming.

Arthur's permanent way of increasing attributes is this simple, and you can't come up with any tricks.

"Is it the intelligence value that affects spell slots?"

Zhao Xu suddenly asked cautiously.

For intelligence to affect spell slots, it needs to be constant for over 24 hours to take effect.

In general, what can persist for 24 hours or more is essentially the same as permanent.

Zhao Xu worried that there might be some unknown special spell that could temporarily add a few points of intelligence attributes.

"That's for sure."

"25 points?"

According to Anzhiya's deviation of 5 points, it means that any value within the range of 20-30 is considered winning.
Here is the translation:

Zhaoxu directly estimated it to be 27 limits and then subtracted two points to estimate, because he had just calculated it based on the limit.

"You're looking down on me too much, can you multiply it by two?"

"How is it possible to have 50 points?"

Zhaoxu was having a hard time believing it.
