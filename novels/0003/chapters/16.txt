Chapter 17: The Real Game

It was three days before Zhao Xu finally recovered from the content mentioned by him and Anita. Even the impact of this event was not as profound as the profoundness of this event. The crossover was just an opportunity, and Arthur's complexity allowed Zhao Xu to be almost powerless.

Although he initially managed to persuade his parents to invest all their assets in Arthur, under the resource-scarce situation of the initial players, he couldn't expect to get anything good.

Zhao Xu was just about to crossover, and many things could only be roughly planned, with the direction of the future clarified. That night, he looked at the magic textbook and felt a bit exhausted, fell asleep, and then lay on the bed, thinking about the events of the day, and only then realized that he had actually gotten lucky again.

Zhao Xu's two roommates had both quit the game earlier, with Zhang Qi, the resident advisor, being a warrior. The +2 strength belt from his previous life was half-sold and half-given to him.

Zhang Qi was still in a daze from the warrior training course, and it was basically the same for all warrior players. They would eat a set meal, and the instructor would use a stick to beat them, and the trainees would dodge.

Those non-fatal injuries made Zhang Qi feel dizzy. Zhao Xu couldn't persuade Zhang Qi to change his powerful profession.

In his previous life, Zhang Qi's warrior nickname was very cautious and had accumulated four revival stones, which he entrusted to his comrades for the Star Lake Battle in two months.
Here is the translation of the text:

The battle was the first large-scale battle where players took the lead and participated, and it sparked a wave of enthusiasm after the opening of the game. However, Zhang Qi tried switching jobs, but nothing could recapture the original thrill, so he ultimately returned to playing as a warrior.

Most of the players who went offline that night were complaining about the training system in Arthur's game. Many players vented their frustration on the game's forum, criticizing the game's creators for being too arrogant and pretentious. The game's rating on the platform also plummeted due to negative reviews from players.

It wasn't until the third day that the first batch of players completed their training courses and started to venture out. The negative reviews slowly began to subside. The game's developers remained silent, refusing to explain the issue and instead started promoting their next big project.

It seemed as though Arthur's game was just a fleeting surprise and not the centerpiece of the gaming series. In general, Arthur's popularity gradually cooled off after the first night.

Zhou Xu, on the second day, took advantage of the fact that the game had not yet been open for 24 hours and told his parents a white lie, convincing them to register an account and log in to the character creation interface, where they could quit. Of course, Zhou Xu wouldn't dare say that he had traveled back in time from 10 years later, when the earth would be destroyed in a year and everyone would have to survive in Arthur's game.

If Zhou Xu's parents found out, they would immediately drive him to the hospital for a mental check-up. Even if Zhou Xu passed the check-up, he would never be able to play this game again.

So Zhou Xu decided to entrust his parents to buy an account and collect it, which would appreciate in value later. Before logging in yesterday night, Zhou Xu had planned to buy some test accounts.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, he found that his test account directly encountered Arthur's top-level organization and unfolded a massive main storyline, and he just chickened out.

Just like many parents who are doctors don't want their kids to become doctors. It's not that being a doctor is bad, but rather they'd rather have their kids earn less money and live a peaceful and safe life.

After Zhao Xu's parents heard about his collection methods, they didn't care about the value of these accounts at all.

However, this was the first time Zhao Xu showed his collection mentality, so they naturally gave him strong support. Not to mention registering 299 accounts, registering 2999 accounts wouldn't be a problem.

For the remaining two days, Zhao Xu was completely immersed in Arthur's game, basically logging in every morning at 8 am and staying online until 4 am the next morning.

In between, he would log out a few times to eat.

Players in Arthur's world don't need to eat.

This point has a profound impact, which only became apparent a year later when the whole nation was crossing over.

Zhao Xu's crazy behavior of skipping classes directly shocked his classmates.

However, others are not your parents, and all they can do is advise and cover for him.

Zhao Xu was not making a death-defying move; he just thought it was a bit urgent at the beginning.

This may also be related to the evaluation of the organization at the end of the scroll, so Zhao Xu basically spent his days outside of meals playing Arthur, and spent the evenings studying the magical textbooks provided by Anzhiya with great effort.

During the day, he occasionally attended the magic lectures held in the floating city, which were basically selected by Anzhiya for him.

However, Anzhiya never let him touch the magic model, nor did he let him touch how to cast spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

The teacher didn't adopt the conventional teaching method, and the student's magical abilities were not well-organized. The lectures on magic were mostly too profound for Zhao Xu, who was unable to fully comprehend them. Even though Anzhiya had selected some lectures that were purely theoretical, Zhao Xu still found them difficult to understand. He didn't dare to pretend to be serious, as the names of the lecturers on stage were familiar to him from his studies on the history of magic. It was unclear whether the lecturer was actually the old master of the current final volume.

In terms of career choice, Zhao Xu didn't deceive his two roommates, saying that he had been sent to Mistral. He then used the content of online wizarding education and roughly summarized it.

Apart from the eyes of his two roommates, who said "You wizards are also so miserable", Zhao Xu also felt that he had been playing games non-stop. Most people would either give up or play through the game and then criticize it as a bad game. It didn't matter whether it was right or wrong, as everyone had their own choices.

Even Zhao Xu didn't know what he was reading in his magical texts. He could only bear with patience and silently observe the online trends. The players of combat-type classes, who had been online continuously for three days, had already completed their training and achieved the level of 1st-level basic profession. Even warriors and barbarians, the two major professions, had reached a small peak, with most players in each town having completed their training.

However, the newly trained players found that there were no new NPCs to assign them tasks, such as killing the yellow mouse in the village chief's house.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The entire Arthur, as if they didn't exist, or rather, they were treated like native-born people. Players didn't find this unusual, and some wild scholars on the forum started analyzing, believing this was a step towards a new game concept by TC, which undoubtedly hinted at a future trend.

For the grandmasters, Zhao Xu, who knew the future, would definitely sneer at this. A player who had never proven themselves, with no reputation, living in a relatively safe town with no special channels, where did they get so many tasks to complete?

When players' reputations emerged after half a year, these issues wouldn't be a problem.

Zhao Xu always brushed the forum while eating, and in Arthur, there were some places that published newspapers.

Finally, after Zhao Xu finished his stir-fry and was about to throw away the takeout box, he suddenly discovered a sticky note on the hot topic, posted less than 20 minutes ago.

Zhao Xu quickly logged in to take a look.

The post title was highlighted and bolded: "Be careful when taking tasks, this game has no new player maps."
"I and my roommates, all melee players, scheduled a group outing to the wilderness to hunt monsters just after completing our training. Who knew we'd stumble upon ten goblins, six wielding hammers, four with rifles, and they were attacking a merchant caravan. We upheld the principle of not taking sides with monsters and directly charged forward."
"Who knew that after we, the four of us, managed to defeat five goblins with the merchant caravan's help."
Here's the translation of the text:

"Oh no, suddenly hundreds of mobs came out of nowhere, riding wolves, and charging towards us from all over the mountain."

"The merchant teams we helped are also cowardly, running away without a word, not even shouting at us."

"The key issue is that there are hundreds of monsters around the new player village, and it's pointless to level up. This player is probably thinking that all players will have to rely on each other to venture out of the village."

Zhou Xu looked at this player's post, remaining silent.

Someone asked how the game ended, and it's obvious that they got revived.

In the game, some players still think there's a new player village. It's been three days, but they're still holding onto that fantasy.

As for the in-game NPCs, it's not rare for them to betray or deceive players, especially if they're from the evil faction.

It seems that players need to suffer for a week to realize this.

This is also the reason why many players tend to join reputable organizations like the Adventurer's Guild.

Or it might be because the faction is compatible with their profession, and the NPCs are trustworthy.

Many players have left comments saying that this game is ridiculously realistic.

Zhou Xu could only smile bitterly, thinking that his family was destroyed and he was killed in his previous life, and the realism of the game is definitely top-notch.

However, after Zhou Xu finished reading this post, he suddenly noticed another post being pushed to the top - "Help, I killed an NPC and was immediately locked up, deleted my character and re-registered, but I'm still stuck in the evil faction. How can I play my Druid faction?"
