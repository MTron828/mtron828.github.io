Chapter 115: A Gentle Breeze on the Plain

As Zhao Xu gazed at the stern-looking guards in front of him, his breathing quickened slightly, but he didn't make any rash decisions.

If he were a fully-fledged knight with a mount from the heavenly realm, he might have been able to slip past these guards. However, he was no longer a warrior, and it would be better for him to be honest.

Although Zhao Xu was confident in his ability to defend himself with his mage's armor and shield magic, he knew that his defensive skills wouldn't be enough to take down these heavily-armed guards.

Since becoming a mage, Zhao Xu had found himself instinctively simulating combat scenarios and analyzing his own tactics in various situations. However, facing the current situation, he realized that his Seven-Colored Spray was the only technique that could potentially take down a group of people. He also knew that the enemy would not give him a chance to cast a spell.

As someone who had been summoned before, Zhao Xu was aware that defeating the people in front of him would be meaningless. This was just the first hurdle.

Without mentioning the batch of guards in front of him, there were countless scouts and sentries lurking in the surrounding areas. Even if the iron cauldron in the corner was lit, it would only take a short time for hundreds of people to gather here.

After thousands of years of training, everyone was familiar with this type of setup, which was designed to facilitate search and counter-search.

"A adventurer from the other side, dismount and come forward to be inspected," a guard with a commanding presence shouted, his armor gleaming with metal plates on his helmet.

At the same time, there were three adventurers who looked similar to him, all with their hands tied and squatting in a corner, clearly waiting for the next wave of reinforcements to arrive and take them away. However, Zhao Xu didn't have time to worry about the civilians, as he dismounted his horse and prepared for battle.

On the opposite side, three people were walking towards him, two of whom were holding light crossbows with arrows that emitted a faint blue glow, indicating that they had undergone a toxic process. After leveling up to level 2, Zhao Xu had obtained the life die of a 2nd-level mage, with a result of 3 points, added to his 2 points of constitution, making his life value increase from 8 HP to 13 HP. This was considered a small gain.

Currently, a typical 1st-level mage with 12 constitution would only have 5 HP. Even 1st-level warriors might not have as high a life value as Zhao Xu. He had already taken two arrow shots and could still recover without losing consciousness, thanks to his life value. This was the ability given to them by their life value.

"Who are you? Where did you come from? Where are you going?" asked the leader of the guards, his face stern. They would not tolerate anyone who dared to appear here without official authorization, as this was a crime that would definitely lead to imprisonment. Zhao Xu, who had previously served as a border guard, knew that anyone who appeared here would be treated as a prisoner. He had a premonition that something was amiss.

His eyes fell upon the distant horizon, and he suspected that the difficulties of the border region were underestimated. There had been some unknown changes between the Tianbei Commercial Federation and Caso and Bautan.

Zhao Xu knew that if he took out his mage badge, the others would recognize him as a registered mage and would likely send him away. However, he would not be able to reach the northern town. Even if he went through the Nan Island Forest to another town, it would take at least three days.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Zhao Xiu, compared to the current group of players, had fought for ten years in Arthur's era, and some explicit or implicit rules he still understood many.

He immediately took out the proof issued by the Moonlight Guild of Wizards.

Although Zhao Xiu didn't want to admit it, this proof indeed gave him the confidence to roam freely in the wilderness of South Forest.

The group of mercenaries surrounding him, originally from the Heavenly Alliance, suddenly became his logistical teammates.

The leader of this guard team might not recognize the seal of the Wizards' Guild of North Castle, but he would definitely recognize the seal of the Moonlight Guild in nearby Moonlight Town.

Zhao Xiu didn't understand why the Guild's secretary also had the seal of the Moonlight Town Government.

The higher authorities are different from the present, and the same is true in Arthur's era.

When the three guards who had been watching cautiously saw Zhao Xiu pulling out something, they had already lifted their weapons to knock Zhao Xiu down and ask questions.

However, after seeing the document, the three guards relaxed and their faces eased slightly.

A proof with a blue cover and gold trim, even if it's a fake, would not come cheap.

The leader of the guards raised an eyebrow, thinking to himself that it's impossible that the offspring of a big shot came to play.

As he took off his helmet, he slightly bent his originally straight waist and extended his hand to receive the proof document.

"Whoa!"

Suddenly, an arrow flew like a gust of wind and pierced the forehead of the guard standing in front.

Accompanied by the opponent's unbelievable gaze.

In this way, a cold corpse directly fell to the ground, like a storm that swept through everyone's hearts.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the instant that the arrow pierced the enemy's forehead, accompanied by the sound of enemy attacks and screams, Zhao Xuan cursed the thieving bandits who had done this to him, while frantically beginning to cast a defensive spell.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan was already crouched down, not just because he needed to, but because he had already soiled himself. The time spent casting the spell was precious in this face-to-face confrontation.

Just as Zhao Xuan was about to bite down and recite the final phrase of the spell "Mage Shield", the two guards standing in front of him suddenly reacted. One of them turned and fled, while the other released the bowstring with a bitter expression.

In this chaotic moment, the guards were unclear about where the attack was coming from, but Zhao Xuan, standing at the forefront, was absolutely sure that he had not missed his target.

This was also the reason Zhao Xuan was casting the spell, and he was about to explain it, but he probably had to go back to the sacred temple to explain it to those statues.

"Thud." The second arrow struck, echoing through the air.

【Adventurer Summer, your defense check failed, taking 1D8=3 damage.】
The guard's arrow struck Zhao Xuan's thigh, causing a sharp pain that invaded his consciousness.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan could only bite down and curse his luck, grateful that the arrow had only struck his thigh, causing 3 HP damage.

If it had struck his head, it would have been a different story.

Even worse, if it had struck him directly and critically, he would have had to sing a sad song on the way back to the city.

But Zhao Xuan was just about to finish reciting the incantation when the non-fatal injury caused a surge of pain that disrupted his concentration, causing him to stumble over his chanting rhythm.

【Adventurer Summer, casting focus check: 4 (skill level) + 2 (constitution) + 4 (battle reflex) + D20 = 10 + 10 = 20, exceeding the difficulty of 14 = 10 (basic) + 3 (damage) + 1 (spell level), and the focus check succeeded.】
Suddenly, a powerful force came directly from his skill panel, energizing Zhao Xu's entire body and sustaining his spellcasting.

This unconscious driving force allowed Zhao Xu to successfully cast the spell.

A shapeless shield appeared directly on Zhao Xu's body, as solid as a rock.

Zhao Xu saw the spell succeed and immediately grabbed the mount he had summoned, using his memories of past riding skills to flip and jump onto its back. He then leaned forward, holding the reins tightly as he galloped away.

At the same time, warriors from a distance, wearing light armor and carrying curved swords, were charging towards the checkpoint. The people who had been captured by the checkpoint and were now trying to escape, took advantage of the distraction to make a run for it.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your defense level is 14th level, and you have taken 13 points of damage. Your defense was successful.】

The sound of an arrow hitting Zhao Xu's back echoed through the air, deflecting by the shield's power.

As Zhao Xu galloped away, he couldn't help but look back to see who was relentlessly pursuing him.
