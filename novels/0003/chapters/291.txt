Chapter 292: Crossing the Secret

Before the great disaster, anyone who obtained a divine attribute could directly become a demigod, and their profession level would rapidly increase to break through the legend. After becoming a god, the next step is to decide which faction to join or which pantheon to belong to.

Then, slowly cultivate one's faith system until the number of believers is sufficient to ignite the divine flame and gain the ability to wield "super divine power", which is the same power Zhao Xu obtained temporarily.

Until the number of believers is sufficient to make oneself a powerful god, one can consider starting to establish one's own temple and searching for opportunities to become the main god.

Only gods who have become the "main god" can break free from the shackles of the number of believers and will not fall back to the level of a demigod if the main world of the Arthurian pantheon is destroyed.

After the great disaster, the gods re-signed the covenant, and from then on, only legendary strong individuals can obtain divine attributes to become gods.

By this time, there will no longer be cases of suddenly becoming a god like a stray cat or dog.

At this point, Zhao Xu could only watch as the intangible and invisible "dead god attribute" remained in his information panel. After Lakshmi returned to his body, he fell into a deep sleep again.

Zhao Xu could not confirm whether this "attribute" was enough to promote him to the level of a demigod.

However, he had paid 1 revival stone to exchange for the divine attribute, and it was a deal that was the most profitable he had ever made.

After tidying up, Zhao Xu directly left the temple of the magic goddess and headed straight for the floating city.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

After sitting in Ana's office for nearly two hours, Zhao Xu finally saw Ana return. Seeing her come in, Zhao Xu also stood up directly and greeted her. "Good luck," Ana said, her tone laced with double meaning, while humming a tune as if she was in a good mood. Then she looked at Zhao Xu's pale face and stopped in her tracks, pointing at his nose tip and saying, "I want to restore your attributes."

Ana's words were suddenly filled with magical energy. Under the effect of the "wish" spell, her wish suddenly twisted out of thin air, generating a powerful magical force that was inputted into Zhao Xu's body, instantly eliminating the 4 points of physical quality he had lost.

Before Zhao Xu could express his gratitude, Ana interrupted him, saying, "Just write me a two-thousand-gold-coin IOU and don't bother with polite words about not wanting to owe me money."

As she spoke, she sat back down in her office chair, sinking deeply into it. At this moment, she continued to look at Zhao Xu, still unable to help but sigh: "Xun, you should reach level 9 within ten months."

"Teacher, is there a reason?" Zhao Xu finally couldn't help but ask, looking at the time node Ana had mentioned.

"Because then Arthur will face a major upheaval, and residents of a world that will be destroyed will enter. You'll need to be at least level 9 to have the ability to defend yourself then," Ana said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's expression also began to grow serious. Arthur's land was extremely vast, and it was not just a matter of accommodating a few more people from another world.

"What about that world, which will be destroyed a year later?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Not, there are still two to three years, but it's necessary to prepare in advance. From the perspective of the universe, two to three years is an insignificant margin, and the one-year deadline itself is already an estimated maximum time limit."

"This is the will of the gods?" Zhao Xu looked at the "divine armor" that An Ti Noya used to block divine power and asked.

"No, this is the will of the world." An Ti Noya replied in a more obscure tone.

"Whenever a 'universe' ends, the surrounding 'universes' will transfer a sufficient number of people to it," An Ti Noya said. "Then, at the time of migration, I will provide some assistance. However, the number of people who can survive will depend on the inhabitants of that universe."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath, "What method will be used?"

This time, Zhao Xu's question finally stumped An Ti Noya, who slightly tilted her head and then smiled mysteriously. "I haven't experienced this before, but if I were in charge..."

"I would dig up enough soil in Arthur's land, convert it into meteorite material, and then summon this meteorite, which I have engraved with countless spells, to the opponent's universe. Then, through legendary magic, I would duplicate a part of it."

"This way, the meteorite will appear suddenly, like a shooting star, and spread across the opponent's world, forming a network. Then, I would start the legendary magic and ritual when the meteorite lands, summoning the spirits to crossover."

Zhao Xu finally understood, realizing that the meteorites from the past were not used to destroy the world, but were actually a signal for magic?

The places where Arthur's soil is dug up are not just one, and the meteorite production points are somewhere else. Therefore, the areas arranged by the meteorites will be transmitted to the corresponding Arthur's areas.
Zhao Xu, suddenly realizing the reason for his past life's reincarnation, was momentarily stunned. His expression changed several times. Each time he wanted to ask Novia what was going on, but he didn't know where to start.

Indeed, after the meteorite fell, everyone lost consciousness and was reborn as Arturus. On Earth, they inherited the same attributes as Arturus. The former players of Arturus perfectly inherited everything in Arturus. Novia gave him a 9th-level skill, which was the time Zhao Xu could cast the five-ring magic.

The first step of advancement had been basically completed.

"Return to Chaos." Suddenly, Novia flashed in front of Zhao Xu, her hands condensing a chaotic energy vortex and directly injecting it into Zhao Xu's stomach.

【Adventurer Summer, you lost the "Steel Will" expertise and gained the "Chaos" expertise.】
Novia didn't loosen her grip on Zhao Xu's stomach, but instead continued to cast another spell - "Abandon Chaos".

【Adventurer Summer, you lost the "Chaos" expertise and gained the "Indeterminate" expertise.】
After only two spells, Novia completed the legendary expertise cleansing, converting Zhao Xu's recently acquired "Steel Will" expertise into a spellcasting expertise. "You've determined it," Novia said. "This Steel Will expertise has been converted into a spellcasting expertise. As for the 5th-level spellcasting expertise, arrange for 'Spell Endurance', so that when you reach level 6, you'll have some combat power and won't be a burden in Arturus's small team."
Here is the translation of the text:

Listening to Anzhiya arrange her own specialty, Zhao Xu didn't have any objections, and in reality, he would also arrange things similarly afterwards.

These two specialties, respectively, correspond to compressing spells into an instant and prolonging spells to eternity.

"Teacher, after completing this 'Steel Will' specialty, will I still stay in the Floating City and wait for your arrangement?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No," Anzhiya shook her head this time. "Young eagles must learn to fly. You don't need to come back until you've mastered 4-ring magic before level 7. Just go out and practice slowly. That's what I require of you - to team up with other adventurers."

Zhao Xu was taken aback that Anzhiya had decided to let him go two levels and required him to team up with others.

At this time, Anzhiya also returned to Zhao Xu the items he had accumulated in her possession.

With the newly obtained magical items, Zhao Xu finally felt a sense of security returning.

It's undeniable that half of a mage's abilities come from magical items, especially after using up all the spell slots. That feeling becomes even more profound.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu also changed into his magical items one by one, and only then realized that his magical items had a quantity level - "Stellar Cloak", "Mechanical Eye Mirror", "Invisible Ring", "Legendary Death Soul Staff", "Suppressive Outer Skin", "Time Reversal Talisman", "Teleportation Boots", "Eternal Flame Wand", "Howard's Convenient Bag", "Automatic Memo Feather Pen", "Orange Yellow Corundum", and "Higher Super Magic Instant Wand" in total.

Zhao Xu was confident that even when crossing dimensions, he could rely solely on these few equipment items to be the richest player in the game.
At this time, Zhao Xu took back the "Time Reversal Amulet" with a golden base and a long, slender bottle from Zhāntǐ Niǎo, saying, "Teacher, I'll give this back to you."

Earlier, Zhāntǐ Niǎo had lent this to him, and the power of reversing time was indeed formidable. Zhao Xu had used this trick to play a lot of tricks. However, he didn't expect that after going three thousand miles, he would finally return the item to its original owner after nearly half a month.

Who knew that Zhāntǐ Niǎo would smile and say, "Don't need it, consider it a reward for completing half of the mission this time. You also helped them reach that transmission door, saving us the trouble of searching for it later."

Before Zhao Xu could politely decline, Zhāntǐ Niǎo suddenly stood up and prepared to leave, looking at Zhao Xu with a melancholic expression as he was about to leave the door. As she walked out, she whispered in a voice barely audible, "Hurry up and become legendary, silly boy."

Until Zhāntǐ Niǎo's figure disappeared.

Zhao Xu only lifted his head, with a hint of confusion in his eyes.

Legendary?
