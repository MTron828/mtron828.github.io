Chapter 520: One Ball Decides Life and Death, Harm Unleashed

At this moment, the corpse of the rodent-like person had revealed its true nature, still unaware of its surroundings, and was continuously letting out a blood-curdling scream.

Slowly, its screams began to approach the shrill and short cries of the rodent, making one's heart palpitate.

However, in the midst of the crowd's terrified expressions, this rodent-like person seemed to have realized something, and with a hint of incredulity, it touched its face and let out a high-pitched scream.

"It wasn't me who killed them, it's really not me who killed them," it seemed to be explaining, "I don't know why I've become this way?"

"Did I just reveal my true nature?" White Dragon Serus was also caught off guard by this sudden development.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, showed no sign of empathy, gazing at the scene with a cold and detached expression. He spoke in a low and resonant tone, "Beast-humans can transform into beasts or half-beasts, or even completely transform into animals."

"However, this ability is only limited to naturally born beast-humans or those who have been infected and are aware of their condition, and can only transform into two forms."

"Fear or anger can also cause beast-humans to involuntarily transform."

The crowd, which had been watching the scene, was shocked when they heard this, as the opponent had already transformed into a large, pig-like rodent, its original clothes torn to shreds.

"Grab it!"

As the rodent began to kick its legs, preparing to escape, the squad leader yelled out, "Catch it!"

For a cooked duck, he certainly wouldn't let it fly away.
As Zhao Xu saw this scene, he calmly took off his gloves, preparing to tidy up.

It's not like he's surrounded by a group of violent dragons like Serus, just a vicious rat that's causing trouble. Every year, the patrol team in the small town has to deal with countless vicious rats. Rats are the lowest-level existence in the beast-human sequence, whether they're in their fully formed "vicious rat" or hybrid "half-human, half-rat" form, they're all just trash at level 2.

Even if you put on the "rat person" template, it's only level +3, far inferior to the level +8 vampire.

Just a moment ago, everyone was hesitant to approach the half-human, half-rat because they didn't have much experience. But now that they've seen it's just a common vicious rat, even adventurers without personal weapons would directly take a seat and get ready to fight.

A few rounds later, the vicious rat was crushed by everyone and had eaten a whole meal, its movements severely restricted.

"Take her away and interrogate her properly," the team leader said with a triumphant smile, "Let's see if she has any accomplices in Starfall Town."

The team leader seemed to see a small merit in front of him.

He immediately showed a flattering expression, preparing to invite Zhao Xu to go with him.

But the next moment, the team leader hadn't even finished turning around when he was suddenly blown away, as if he had been hit by an air cannon, and crashed heavily onto the nearby table, his bones almost broken.

"Team leader!"
Here is the translation of the text:

They immediately noticed that, at the position where their team leader stood, the smoke from the impact had not yet fully dissipated. Another hybrid creature, a rodent-like being, was standing there. It was more robust and larger than the previous one.

Moreover, this rodent-like being was fully armed from head to toe, with a fine sword at its waist that was even emitting a magical glow. Its scaly armor was intricately crafted and had a perfect finish.

"Be careful," someone shouted.

"It's the culprit!" someone else cried out.

"Surround it!" someone yelled.

The voices were chaotic, with only the offspring of the beastmen not panicking. Therefore, everyone suddenly realized that this rodent-like being might be the source of the infection that caused the recent murder.

A few brave warriors and barbarian players immediately charged forward, holding their long swords.

Arthur stood at the forefront, fearless of death, except for the demon and devil who could be revived.

However, these players were unable to attack for more than one or two rounds before being severely injured and retreating.

The flash of swords and the clash of steel left holes in the simple armor worn by these players.

"It's a tough nut to crack!" a wounded warrior player exclaimed, "The opponent is definitely a professional, with a rodent-like state, and possibly over level 10. Be careful!"

"Will you go up?" Vivian asked, shrugging her shoulders and looking at Zhao Xu for guidance.

At this moment, Vivian was already standing in front of Zhao Xu, shielding him from potential attacks from all sides, as a Saint of Revenge.

The powerful rodent-like being surveyed the crowd in the tavern, muttering to itself, "You're all a bunch of trash."

A patrol officer who had been knocked to the ground looked at the fine sword wound on his body and burst into tears, crying, "Am I infected?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Immediately, he burst into a fierce cry, and Zhao Xu was about to explain to the other party that there was no possibility of infection with a direct and brutal attack. However, the wild man, Anguo, was not involved in the initial capture process and was about to pull Zhao Xu into a fierce battle.

At this moment, Anguo glanced at the Druid companions below and noticed that the other party was gesturing for him to calm down, but Anguo shook his head instead.

Anguo then unwrapped his backpack and prepared to take out his weapons and tricks.

Zhao Xu waited for a while to ensure that apart from the wild man, there were still some opportunities left, and the other locals who had combat power had been intimidated by the mouse-stronger's one-hit-kill feature and were no longer willing to advance.

He shook his head and said to Vivian, who was still preparing for battle, "Help bind these two mice."

At this moment, the Druid, Hong Feng Ye, who was hiding behind Zhao Xu, felt strange when she heard his nonsensical words.

The mice were still unscathed, and they were already discussing binding issues. However, the next moment...

Zhao Xu raised his hand slightly and pointed at the mouse-stronger with a "Secondary Acid Ball" and said, "Secondary Acid Ball."

In an instant, two "acid liquid balls" with a size of about 6 centimeters appeared on the palm of Zhao Xu's hand.

They solidified and then shot towards the mouse-stronger.

Like a flash of fire, the mouse-stronger, who was unaware of the two acid balls, tried his best to dodge.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only the accuracy of the two of them is due to Zhao Xu's combat awareness being unleashed, and under Zhao Xu's attack ability, the trajectory is extremely cunning and difficult to defend against. They just slipped through the armor and entered the body of this mouse man.

With a body trembling with screams, this originally energetic mouse man, with a massive physique, suddenly fell to the ground.

Subsequently, Veveian had already approached and, with a flick of her hand, pulled out a rope to bind the opponent.

"What kind of spell is this?" the player exclaimed in frustration.

If a spell like this, with such mighty power, had been used by a mage, the door of the Mage Association would have been broken by the players long ago.

"It's a Second-Rate Acid Ball, a single-ring spell," Zhao Xu said lightly, without explaining further.

As the others slowly regained their composure, he turned around and walked back to his room, as if he didn't care about the subsequent merits.

"What is this spell, so fierce?" The others gradually regained their composure, and one of them asked.

A mouse man who had knocked down ten or so people, including a patrol team, was actually knocked down by a single-ring spell? If it were a four-ring spell, they could accept it.

The key question is that the other party said it was a single-ring spell.

At this time, the Druid Red Maple Leaf, who had been silent all along, quietly walked over to the mouse man's side, observing the massive acid burn wounds on his chest.

"The Second-Rate Acid Ball is a legendary 'ball series' spell, not a core spell, but because of its powerful combat strength, it has become extremely famous. Many powerful mages have used the ball series spells to accumulate unimaginable damage." The Druid Red Maple Leaf explained.
Here is the translation:

"How high is it?" The savage man looked astonished at the direction where Zhao Xu's figure had disappeared, thinking to himself, "Finish setting up and then run, it's quite like the King of Wind."

"No," Druid Red Maple Leaf explained, "compared to the 'Strong Acid Ball' spell of the 4th ring, the secondary ball damage is not high."

"For example, the opponent just cast a 1st-level spell that deals 1-8 damage, and for every two levels, the spellcaster's level increases the damage by 1-8, until the 9th level, which deals 5-40 damage (5D8)."

The savage player, although unfamiliar with magic, still understood the basic damage. He couldn't help but complain, "Although the 9th-level spell is just barely passable, the initial damage is too weak."

Druid Red Maple Leaf shook his head, "The key is that this spell ignores resistance and ignores defense, only considering distant contact, which means it will deal damage whenever it hits. The key is, that fellow wizard, how did he use this ordinary damage range to knock down a nearly 10th-level strong mouse warrior?"

As Red Maple Leaf spoke, everyone in the scene fell into deep thought.

"Housekeeper, who is that fellow wizard just now?" the team leader asked on the spot.

"This?" The housekeeper, who had just been frightened out of his wits, showed a hesitant expression, as if he wanted to say something but couldn't.

"What do you have to hide?" the team leader scolded, his tone full of menace: "He's a big shot, and I'm the one in charge here. You'll die before I do."

Hearing this threatening remark, the housekeeper hesitated for a moment before speaking, "Sir, that wizard is the ruler of the land on the other side of the block."

"Or rather, he is the nominal lord of this land."
The text translates to:

Suddenly, a player who had just returned to the game looked puzzled, "What does it mean? What's the riddle?"

His companion, however, had no patience and pushed his arm, "Shh, it's our first player, Zhong Xia Da Shen."

"The lord of Zezhou Town, the president of the Association of Mages."

"I'm going!"
