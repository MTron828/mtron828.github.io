Chapter 645: The Last Miracle

After Zhao Xu's appearance, the commotion behind him subsided, and the atmosphere became calm again. As the news spread, more and more people came to visit, including the high-ranking officials who had temporarily set up camp. However, Zhao Xu still politely declined their visits, urging them to return to their duties to prepare for the impending massive storm.

Zhao Xu began to realize that he could only help so much. Originally, there were countless educated Earth immigrants in Yanan, and they were not in the same desperate situation as they were a few days ago. Therefore, Zhao Xu decided to rely on the collective strength of the people to resist this storm.

As for Zheng Jia's family and their friends, they also followed Zhao Xu to the explosion site outside the camp. Zheng's mother was shocked to see the devastating scene.

Earlier, they had wanted to come, but the area outside the camp was extremely dangerous, and ordinary civilians without powerful players couldn't survive there. On the other hand, the chain explosion that killed Zheng Xin's friend also led to the area being completely blocked off until the investigation was complete.

This was the first time Zheng Jia's family had seen the scene of the incident. They looked around, and their eyes fell on a desolate wasteland. The originally barren trees, dry grass, and stone sand had been completely burned to ruins, leaving a scorched and unrecognizable landscape.
Here is the translation of the text:

Qi Qi, who had been to this place before, sighed and said, "We were already like this when we arrived earlier." 

"Initially, when Ling'er was here, she was accompanied by a team of guards. Even they were all killed, and no one knows what happened. There were no eyewitnesses or survivors."

As she spoke, she gazed at Zhao Xu, the master of this land, with hopeful eyes.

"If anyone can reverse this, then Zhao Xu might be a candidate for it."

"Is that so?" a warrior asked, frowning.

"It's hard to say. The five-ring resurrection spell requires a complete physical body. The seven-ring revival spell also requires a small part of the body, even if it's killed by disintegration. But the nine-ring revival spell can revive the body completely."

As soon as she said this, several people in the room looked stunned, and Ling'er's classmates looked pale.

Even ordinary civilians know the difference between one to nine rings of magic.
The higher the ring, the greater the difference.
Even the current Zhao Xu, who is only a five-ring mage, cannot achieve it.
Going up one more ring is already impossible without a corresponding path.
The female pastor also sighed and said, "Even powerful churches that can perform five-ring resurrection spells will not make it easy. Let alone nine-ring complete revival. Only the highest-level people in the church can do it."

"However, Ling'er is a team pastor and does not belong to any church," the female pastor said, looking at Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

Originally, she had been keeping this conversation in her heart, not wanting to say it out loud and crush the psychological defense lines of the crowd. But now, looking at the need to solve the problem in the summer, as a magic priestess, she naturally took the initiative to help the other party find a foothold without realizing it.

"Mr. Zhao Xu, do you have a solution?" Zheng Mu's face was sorrowful, tightly grasping Zhao Xu's hand, and even the creases on her sleeve were indented. It was as if the person in front of her was the only lifeline.

At first, she was hopeless, but her brain was still sharp, and she had already realized that Zheng Xin had good friends who had revealed the meaning in a few words - Zheng Xin was still salvageable, but it was difficult.

"Don't worry, Mother, I'll do my best," Zhao Xu comforted her and patted her shoulder, indicating that the elderly women behind her should support her.

At this moment, the high-ranking officials in the surrounding area, including the other players, were even more shocked.

It seemed that Zhong Xia's sudden visit to repair Zheng's house was not just about having a friend in Zheng Xin.

This humble attitude was already a sign of a junior treating an elder with respect.

But now, in this desolate wasteland, who had the qualifications to address Zhong Xia as an elder?

Perhaps it was the mother-in-law?

Even more so, the promise hidden in the phrase "I'll do my best" was of great weight.

In an instant, the gaze of the high-ranking officials in the surrounding area turned completely different, sighing regretfully and thinking about the opportunities. Maybe their own path to heaven had fallen to the other party.

At this moment, Zhao Xu knelt down on the ground, lightly picking up a block of black, charred remains that had been exploded, still emitting a pungent smell of asphalt.

Then, he began to wander around this explosion area, as if he was feeling the deep sense of change at that moment.

And everyone in this moment held their breath, not daring to disturb him, and maintained a calm and respectful demeanor.
Here is the translation:

In the end, Zhao Xu walked to a severely damaged waste heap, looking at the jet-black dust, silently grinding with his toes, drawing a circle on the spot.

He then took out a long box made of peach wood from his pocket, with a narrow slit on the long side, and the two ends were decorated with golden rivets, and the buckle had precious stone decorations. "The Endless Scroll Box" is a magical item worth 2,800 gold coins. It can hold 50 scrolls, with each scroll allowing the recording of six spells, totaling 300 spells.

As soon as Zhao Xu activated the scroll box, the scrolls inside could immediately extend from the box, ready for him to read. At the same time, it could also provide a +4 bonus to his focus and concentration. The action of extracting the scrolls from the box had been compressed to be as convenient as drawing a weapon, which was also the reason Zhao Xu was willing to spend 3,000 gold coins to bring the box.

At this moment, he extracted a six-ring divine scroll, which recorded the spells used by the former nine-ring priest, Lyra, when searching for the missing young man, Andy, who had disappeared after completing the evil ritual.

This spell was only a six-ring spell for a poet, but it was also the peak of six-ring spells. Before taking action, he needed to see enough "truth".

The surrounding players and civilians watched Zhao Xu's actions with bated breath, wondering if he would use the scroll's spell, which would be powerful enough to make the summer sun on the mountain peak of Yanchun look like a small ant. As Zhao Xu spoke the incantation, the entire ritual program was strictly followed, and a crystal sand clock worth 1,000 gold coins was projected from the scroll, reflecting in front of everyone.

Matching Zhao Xu's slow and steady breathing rhythm, the scenery within a 20-meter radius began to reverse.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

All the onlooking players and civilians couldn't help but cover their mouths, especially Zheng's father and mother, who were overcome with grief as they watched this scene unfold. Zheng Xin'an, who had vanished from this world, suddenly reappeared, seemingly unaware of any anomalies, as she knelt on the ground, using a trowel to collect soil samples.

By rewinding time, the events of the past could be replayed at various scales, from years to centuries. As time went on, the precision of the rewind decreased.

At the level of "heaven," the events and conversations of the people involved could be clearly understood. As a result, everyone could see Zheng Xin'an and the group of bodyguards accompanying her, conducting an investigation in this area, without any unusual occurrences.

"This is the power of magic, isn't it? It can replay everything without monitoring, and there's no secret left for Arthur to hide in front of the wizard."

"Ah, this is too scary! No wonder everyone is afraid of the wizard. It seems that in other aspects, they have such incredible abilities."

As the murmurs in the crowd went on, Zhao Xu continued to manipulate the magic, advancing the scene before him.

Everything proceeded smoothly until a sudden moment when the entire illusionary region was engulfed by an endless, scorching heat wave, accompanied by a tornado, which consumed everything in its path.

Zhao Xu froze the scene in place, then, like reversing a video, he rewound the scene to an earlier time and repeated the explosion multiple times.

This unpredictable technique left everyone stunned.

However, neither Zhao Xu nor the others could detect any anomalies in this scene. From start to finish, there was no murderer or any sounds or conversations.
As Zhao Xia looked down, it seemed like he had triggered a landmine explosion. As he advanced the fantasy scenario, everyone's hearts were racing even faster. Because Zheng Xin'an had been revived after this explosion!

She reassembled her body from the ashes, and the Nine Rings Revival Technique was complete. It was this technique that had allowed Zheng Xin'an to revive perfectly on the spot. However, just as she was regaining her composure, another directional explosion struck, destroying everything in its path. Zheng Xin'an's revival was also repeated.

This scene repeated itself over a dozen times until the ashes no longer assembled into a body, and the explosions ceased.

The people present, including Zheng's parents, were devastated by the sight of their daughter repeatedly dying and being revived. Zheng's mother let out a mournful wail, "Allow!"

Zhao Xia realized that the Lark was releasing the "Nine Rings Revival Technique" within Zheng Xin'an's body. However, the Lark seemed to have exhausted itself and fell into silence. When Zhao Xia arrived at the scene, he didn't hear the Lark's slightest response.

"Why did the revival stop?" asked Qi Qi, who had appeared beside him.

As the fantasy scenario ended, other classmates of Zheng Xin'an gathered around, each standing in a conspicuous position as if trying to draw attention to themselves.

"The Nine Rings Revival Technique, as the most perfect revival technique, consumes a huge amount of energy. Besides the Nine Rings Technique itself, it also requires Holy Water and a 25,000-gold Diamond."
Here is the translation of the text:

"After consecutively reviving nine times, it's impossible to maintain and will eventually degrade into a 'revival technique' with seven loops. It's estimated that the caster is trying to bet on the number of revivals exceeding the remaining explosive power, but it seems they've lost the bet.

The seven-loop revival technique is not as good as the nine-loop one," said Zhao Xu. "The caster themselves will also degrade by one level. It's obvious that Xiǎo Ěr has fallen from level 3 to level 1 and will further deteriorate if they continue to die. Is there still hope, Mr. Zhōng Xià?"

Zhao Xu nodded and smiled reassuringly, waving his hand. "I'll try it first. You all retreat to the area outside the explosion zone."

"I'll cast the nine-loop 'complete revival technique' if this land still has residual power. It might trigger another explosion."

"What about you, Mr. Zhōng Xià?" someone asked immediately.

"This explosion won't kill me," said Zhao Xu calmly, but his brow furrowed slightly.

If he casts the "Shield of Protection" spell, he can perfectly defend against an attack and remain unscathed.

After hearing his words, the crowd slowly retreated to about 100 meters away.

Zhao Xu then took out the "complete revival technique" scroll from the endless scroll case.

Suddenly, the golden light on the scroll caught everyone's attention, even those who were usually calm. The scroll, which could perfectly revive any living being, was too precious to ignore.

There was no regret pill on Earth that could undo death, but in this world, it was possible to reverse death. This was the reason why countless new mages were drawn to the art of magic.

The next second, Zhao Xu began to chant the secret incantation on the scroll, and the magical power poured out. The words on the scroll began to fade away.

"Complete Revival Technique!"
As Zhao Xu let out a loud shout, a sacred light once again descended upon the land, like the gates of heaven opening, washing away evil and redemption songs spreading throughout, with countless mysterious symbols of golden flames falling from the sky like a starry rain.

However, as Zhao Xu gazed on, the original strange power did not appear.

Unlike the first time Zheng Xin'an was repeatedly resurrected, the explosion site remained eerily quiet.

What's going on?

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's mind began to buzz.

The thought that had been avoided and hidden deep in his heart finally surfaced.

As he had thought, the artificial Grim Reaper still possessed some of the immortal powers of the Grim Reaper.

Consistent with the "life and death" powers, the living beings killed by the Grim Reaper could not be resurrected unless their spiritual powers exceeded that of the Grim Reaper.

Unless Zhao Xu accepted this spiritual power, he would be unable to suppress the Grim Reaper's powers that were leaking out.

This was the manifestation of the laws of the mortal world, which could not be matched by divine power.

Zheng Xin'an's initial resurrection was due to Lark's consumption of her own spiritual power. Unfortunately, after Zheng Xin'an lost his body, Zhao Xu was unable to connect with him due to being trapped in the mysterious cave, ultimately leading to Lark's disappearance.

"What's going on? We failed?"

"Impossible!"

"How did Zheng Xin'an initially get resurrected?"

The crowd surrounding him was stunned, unable to believe what was happening.

Should they give up?

As Zhao Xu gazed upon the desolate landscape, he couldn't help but sink into deep thought.

The resurrection technique had no time limit, and Zhao Xu could wait until he found a suitable target for the Grim Reaper to rely on its powers to resurrect.

However, he really couldn't afford to wait any longer.
He couldn't help but look up at the grayish sky, recalling the old mansion in Starfall Town where he and Zheng Xin'an used to live. He remembered the joyful laughter and warm moments they shared.

At this moment, the place had become the new headquarters of the Magic Association. No one knew why all the buildings in the area were requisitioned and demolished, except for one old mansion that was repaired but not torn down. Only Zhao Xu knew the reason, and in this world where the living and the dead coexisted, it was his last lingering thought.

As he looked up at the gray sky, Zhao Xu felt a sudden jolt in his heart. He remembered the time he met the Grand Goddess, who had left three divine marks in his heart. This was a magic that could reverse one's fate and everything.

For the first time, Zhao Xu had made a wish, asking for everyone in the barren land to have an extra layer of clothing to ward off the cold. The second time, he had made a wish, and the heavens had sent countless divine beings to resist the tide of undead. Now, it was the third time, and he was making a wish for himself.

Zhao Xu gazed up at the gray sky and exclaimed with fervor.

"I pray to the goddess to grant me a miracle."
"Resurrect the innocent girl before my eyes."

In an instant, everyone in the scene turned pale. This was because Zhao Xu's previous two wishes had been accompanied by the goddess's power, which had been transmitted to everyone in the barren land.

It was only natural that no one would object to using such a powerful spell to resurrect someone. But now, was it worth it just to resurrect one person?
At that moment, this chaotic thought flooded the minds of everyone, not to mention Zheng Xin Yu's friends who were also unaffected.

Can they muster the power to save a nation to save one person, if it's them? They just didn't know what to say the next moment, and the female pastor in the crowd even knelt down on the spot.

In the midst of the divine light sent down from heaven, the silhouette of the magical goddess Sylvia slowly emerged.
