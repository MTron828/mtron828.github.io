Chapter 245: Game Fever

After Zhao Xu used his "miracle" to revive Zhang Qi and others, he directly logged off to solve the meal issue for that evening.

Unlike the mage profession, the priest profession does not require eight hours of uninterrupted rest to prepare for their divine arts. Zhao Xu decided to spend the night and handle the meal issue earlier than expected.

He went for a run on the path outside the dormitory and then stopped by a fast-food restaurant on Food Street to eat a portion of eggplant and pork chops. He had felt unwell yesterday, so he deliberately took some extra time to exercise today.

As he ran, Zhao Xu felt his physical abilities improving slightly.

When he returned to the dormitory two hours later, Zhang Qi and others had already taken a bath and were browsing the forum.

At that time, his roommate Chen Sīnán was called away by the Knights of Justice and Punishment for another task, missing the Star Lake Battle.

Otherwise, Chen Sīnán, the Saint Warrior of the previous era, would have probably used up all his revive stones just like Zhang Qi in this battle.

"Xu, look at this, you missed a big plot twist in Mistra," Zhang Qi exclaimed when he saw Zhao Xu come in.

"Hurry up and take a look, our team is on the front page of the forum today," Zhang Qi said excitedly.

Zhao Xu just smiled and said, "Don't get excited, I just saw the post on the road, it's Little Hao's post, right?"

"Yes, can you imagine the scene? It was so shocking!" Zhang Qi said.

"I know, I've seen the post, it's very vivid," Zhao Xu said, hanging up his coat.

He is the one who saved them, so how would he not know about this?
When Zhao Xuan saw the scene, he was also silently pondering for a moment.

He could only use the "Seven Rings Revival" class skill, which was limited to three uses per day, without any cost. It was impossible to cover the crowd in front of him.

If he wanted to use the "Resurrection" or "Complete Revival" skills of the cleric, he would have to pay a hefty fee in diamonds.

Before searching the mine owner's treasure, Zhao Xuan couldn't afford it. However, after killing dozens of guards and controlling the 15th-level giant demon that night, Zhao Xuan's own "energy" had increased.

However, since his power came from the "Fiery God Servant", the energy could not be absorbed into his body. Otherwise, these would have accumulated and become Zhao Xuan's later upgrade.

So Zhao Xuan chose to indulge in it, using his own non-absorbed energy to cast divine miracles as a substitute.

The standard version of "Miracle" does not require any personal energy consumption. However, the "Divine Miracle" that can save disasters requires a large amount of energy.

So Zhao Xuan decided to borrow the energy he could not absorb to cast the divine miracle.

As a result, he directly exceeded everyone's imagination.

He created a divine miracle, pulled out seven or eight "Complete Revival" skills, and then used a "Healing" skill.

As for the two posts on the forum, Zhao Xuan had no idea that the heat would rise so quickly in just a few hours.
Here is the translation of the text:

In everyone's eyes, this is the behavior of a player who is dissatisfied with the game's NPCs, using weak strength to challenge a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. This idea of sacrificing for a just cause was initiated by numerous priests and paladin players, and then expanded to various professions.

At this time, many college students are at their most passionate.

Just so, the main players of King Arthur's game are this group of players in their twenties.

In an instant, the two resonated with each other, leading to the magnificent endeavor of thousands of players to conquer "Starfall Lake" today.

"Ah, right, Brother, the development of the entire process is consistent with what you said," Zhang Qi suddenly recalled the stories Zhao Xu had told him before.

With the help of these suggestions, the alliance's integration speed was much faster than before.

"However, Brother Xu, can we win?" Zhang Qi was already thinking about the feasibility of this war.

"You said we have the advantage of five resurrection stones, so our personnel are abundant. As for the disadvantages, it's that we don't have a unified organization, and it's easy for the opponent with a unified organization to defeat us one by one," Zhang Qi explained.

Zhao Xu directly pulled out a chair and sat down, asking Zhang Qi for his thoughts.

"Yes, we players have five resurrection stones, so our personnel are abundant. As for the disadvantages, it's that each team is small and easy to be defeated one by one by the opponent with a unified organization," Zhang Qi said.

Zhao Xu pointed out directly, "And the journey is too long."

This was the reason why the players were almost wiped out after fighting for several days in the Starfall Lake battle in the previous life.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's impossible for me to clench my fist, let alone gather strength, and still flow like a tiny stream. I naturally can't just burst forth and crush the 'Mineral Association'."
"Oh, it's a pity that we can't even build a temple at Star Lake right now."
Zhang Qi was also worried, and in fact, most of the classmates who returned to the class today were rushing back to their homes.
If Zhang Qi knelt down tonight, they would have to rush back to their homes again.
As a result, the original class team of tens of people was directly split into several smaller teams.
"Ah, right, Xiu, you guys are using your magical skills, and it's indeed impressive," said someone.
"But I don't dare imagine that there are players who can open up a godlike state," someone said.
Zhou Xiu didn't feel like telling Zhang Qi that he hadn't actually opened up a godlike state yet, but was just taking down some low-level mobs.
However, he did manage to wipe out the private guards of the mine owners, which would definitely leave them severely injured.
After chatting for a while, Zhou Xiu sat back down at his computer and opened the forum, only to find that many people were sending him private messages.
"This 'Starlight' account, is it not the same as 'East City Rui'?"
Many of the posts on the forum were from the same person, accounting for about 70-80%.
The main reason was that East City Rui's article "The Path of Mages" had specifically mentioned the concepts of "Demon Taming" and "Mage Close Combat".
Some of the content was even identical to the 4th-level mage who seemed like Death itself today, which had used the spell "Ghost Strike" mentioned in the article that could penetrate armor and defense.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, you know why that mage can ignore armor? When players dig up those warriors' equipment today, we found that they actually have huge wounds caused by giant hammers inside."

Zhang Qi suddenly asked the same question.

"Mages aren't supposed to be able to ignore armor, are they?" Zhao Xu said.

"Yeah, I'm jealous, mages don't even fight in close combat and yet they possess such an awe-inspiring piercing spell. Unfortunately, that spell can only be used by oneself, and I can't become a 3rd-level mage, sadly."

"You learned this spell, but it's only effective for one round."

Zhao Xu shattered the opponent's fantasy.

Zhang Qi won't be able to keep this spell unless he becomes a priest. Without it, he can't keep it for 24 hours. He has to use it briefly and then attack again.

The ability to keep the spell is actually a barrier standing before each person.

It's not just these spells that are heaven-defying. It's when they are combined with the expertise of "spell duration" that they become unbeatable.

"Oh, so I'll never have to break someone's armor again, mom's sake, every time I'm about to get a numb hand. This game is getting too hardcore, I'll have basic combat skills by the Middle Ages."

When Zhang Qi heard this, Zhao Xu simply explained, "You don't need ghostly strike, actually, there's a property called 'light' in magic weapons that can penetrate armor."

"How powerful is that?" Zhang Qi looked at Zhao Xu with wide eyes.

"It's quite expensive, you need to add +4 to it," Zhao Xu said.

As a result, Zhang Qi could only sigh and say, "Oh well, it's not worth it."

However, his expression still revealed his dissatisfaction.

A +1 light weapon is equivalent to a +5 weapon, which would cost 50,000 gold coins to start with."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu was also aware of Zhang Qi's envy-filled tone, but he didn't say much. In the past, he would also drool over magic weapons, comforting himself in the same way. In reality, the "light energy" weapon was unable to penetrate the divine defensive armor, and it was even weaker than the "Ghost Strike" technique. As for the monsters outside, none of them were without divine defensive armor.

Zhao Xu didn't elaborate further and instead selected a "Fall Star Lake" strategy he had written earlier from a document. Then, he made some minor adjustments based on the current situation and posted it on the forum.

After synchronizing with Artoire, Zhao Xu's goal had changed. He needed to conserve the energy of the Winter City players as much as possible. If he could save some of the accumulated resources, he could combine them with the wealth accumulated by the Mineral Association over the years.

It was likely that many things would be different when humans crossed over. Finally, Zhao Xu reviewed his edited "Fall Star Lake" strategy post and clicked the send button with caution.

By now, Zhao Xu's account had gained countless followers. He said that mages could learn the "Spider Technique" by eating spiders, and eating "fire ants" could awaken the "Strong Acid Breath" technique, and many players would follow suit.

"Xiao Shao, the Eastern City God has posted another update, it's about 'Fall Star Lake'." Zhang Qi exclaimed excitedly.

However, this was the moment Zhao Xu had already taken off his clothes and entered the bathroom.

At the same time, countless people in the forum were paying close attention, and many who were eating their meals directly opened the post to watch.
For them, this game has already gone beyond just a game, becoming a part of their lives. Meanwhile, the keyword "Arthur" has climbed to the top of Weibo's hot search list for the first time, and has entered the field of view for many outsiders.
