Chapter 536: War Magic

Zhao Xu gazed at Zheng Xin An's expectant expression, and his heart skipped a beat as he took a few steps back involuntarily. Zhao Xu immediately sensed a hint of awkwardness.

"Ah, don't worry, I won't eat you," Zhao Xu joked, waving his hand in a mocking gesture.

The next instant, he raised his staff and precisely positioned it against Zheng Xin An's waist.

"Stone Skin."

Zheng Xin An, who had been itching slightly, stopped scratching and listened to the words.

Stone Skin was an unparalleled "protective magic" that even belonged to the unattainable four-ring magic for current players.

Zhao Xu didn't stop moving; instead, he scattered granite powder and 250 gold dust over Zheng Xin An's body.

This seemingly mischievous action immediately caused the powder and magical energy in contact to combine and resonate.

"Wow, it's so hard," Zheng Xin An felt his outer skin as if it had added a layer of defense.

Subsequently, she glanced at the dynamic bar and couldn't help but cover her mouth, "It suggests that I've obtained a 10/10 damage reduction ability, with a maximum absorption of 150 (10 points per level, capped at 15th level) damage."

Zhao Xu nodded, implying that only "golden weapons" could breach Zheng Xin An's damage reduction ability.

If it were an unenhanced Chimera, its biting attack would only deal 6-16 (2D6+4) points of damage, with 10 points sufficient to absorb half of it.

As for the White Dragon Serus, it was ready to go into the mine.

This four-ring magic was enough to hold off this little girl for a few rounds.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

However, in the instant it turned around, the corner of its eye caught sight of the flashes of magical light behind it.

"Faith!" - One-ring divine art, increasing luck by 5 levels every 10 minutes.

"Higher-grade defense!" - Four-ring divine art, increasing defense by 3 levels for 24 hours.

"Resistance to energy damage!" - Two-ring divine art, absorbing 30 points of energy damage each time (11th-level effect).

"Protective energy damage!" - Two-ring divine art, absorbing a total of 10 points of energy damage per level (up to 120 points).

"You're really reckless!" White Dragon Serus couldn't help but shout out.

"That's just a broken Chimera, even with three heads, it's still only able to spit once every 1-4 rounds," he said.

"This kind of defensive spitting weapon is more than enough to defend against the ancient dragon."

Chimera's spitting weapon is testing its reflexive avoidance ability. Therefore, Zhao Xue's first two divine arts stacked up to give Zheng Xin'an a total of 8 levels of avoidance, making it difficult to fail.

The subsequent resistance to damage and protection of energy damage are targeted at five types of damage: strong acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sound.

Chimera's three heads are selected from the five types of damage: acid, electricity, toxic gas (acid), fire, and cold, which are also four types of energy damage.

With these two divine arts, Zheng Xin'an can still absorb two types of energy damage even if he fails to dodge.

It can be said that he used a few divine arts to greatly reduce the possibility of Zheng Xin'an being injured.

"Alright, let's go!" Zhao Xue also felt that it was about time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough magical abilities to start casting spells, and he can't even begin to think about it.

Just then, he decided to continue stacking his defensive spells, and just as the Chimera was about to attack him, his spells counterattacked and killed it.

"Syrus, what are the characteristics of the Chimera?" he asked.

At this moment, the three of them had already entered a somewhat damp cave, where the sound of dripping water could be heard from time to time.

Hearing Zhao Xu's question, White Dragon Syrus shook his head, "It tastes general, a bit dry, and needs to be marinated before it's edible."

Originally, Zhao Xu had planned to have Syrus explain the characteristics of the Chimera to Zheng Xin'an, and then supplement it.

Who would have thought that the other party would treat the Chimera as food?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but say, "Well, the Chimera, a magical creature, and the dragon tribe have some blood ties, don't you have any psychological barriers eating it?"

"How could we not?" Syrus seemed to savor the taste again.

At this moment, he gazed at the dark depths of the cave, his mouth already starting to water.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that it seemed that he would have to take on the task of educating Zheng Xin'an.

After all, the small town's Chimera attacks had occurred sporadically since the time they had cleared out the lair.

Zhao Xu didn't say another word, took out an unquenchable torch, shone it on the water pool on the ground, and then began to explain in the light of the torch, "Xin'an, imagine what the Chimera is like."

"It's said to have several heads, an eagle's body, and a dragon's skull," Zheng Xin'an guessed.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also began to describe the true appearance of the Chimera that he had seen with his "secret eyes".
Here is the translation of the text:

"Chimeras have a rear half that resembles a massive black goat, while the front half resembles a giant lion. They usually have a pair of brown-black dragon wings, paired with a goat's head, amber-colored eyes, and a reddish-yellow horn.

Another one is a lion's head without fur, with emerald-green eyes. The last one is a dragon's head with evil eyes that are as black as coal. They are usually about three to four meters long and weigh around four tons.

Unfortunately, I have never had the chance to observe these peculiar creatures closely, as each encounter has always ended in mutual destruction."

As Zheng Xin'an's voice echoed through this empty space, "But how do you know so clearly, Mr. Zhongxia?"

"It's simple," Zhao Xu replied, pointing to a dark shadow in front of him. "As long as you can kill one, you can observe it closely, like that one."

Before White Dragon Selerus could finish speaking, the originally immobile shadow suddenly sprang to life, as if a bat was flying by.

"Ah!" Zheng Xin'an was shocked to see the living creature, his eyes wide with terror.

Zhao Xu waved his staff and used an unknown spell to control the chimera that was attacking them.

"Ack!" A loud sound echoed through the air, and the chimera that had been hiding in the corner of the wall fell to the ground, unconscious.

"Is that it?" Zheng Xin'an asked, bewildered.

At this moment, Zheng Xin'an was gazing at the chimera's body, which was covered in black scales, with three heads that matched what Zhao Xu had described.

But it was hard for her to imagine that such a powerful monster could be defeated with just one bite.

"This is the way a high-level player battles, isn't it?" Zheng Xin'an asked.

"No."
Here is the translation of the text:

White Dragon Serus had already ridden on the controlled Chimera, "The 24th Summer Youth is what you players call the 'hang' technique. Even high-level players would still need to punch this monster to death."

"Clunk."

White Dragon Serus swung his massive fist, which was as big as a sand jug, towards the Chimera's head.

...In the evening, numerous player teams, each worth over 10,000 gold coins in reward, gathered in Starfall Town, making the town bustling again.

Due to the danger at night, most teams searching nearby decided to return to the town.

The players chatted and discussed their experiences from the day and the possibility of finding the nest.

"Look."

Suddenly, Zhang Qi knocked on Chen Sennan's waist, causing him to turn around in surprise, "What's wrong?"

At that moment, almost all players looked towards another direction, each with their head held high, staring blankly.

Under the setting sun in Starfall Town, a Chimera was stirring up the dust, leading the way for the returning militiamen who had gone missing that morning.

What was different was that these Chimeras had turned into undead creatures.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had returned to his room, looked at the reappearing old man, who was none other than the founder of the Itzel Kingdom, Marthus.
Marthus, with his hands behind his back, turned around and smiled kindly at Zhao Xu, "Ah, Mr. Summer, are you interested in learning the pressure techniques my master taught me? This is a chapter that even you, with the final scroll, might not be able to flip through."
Here is the translation of the text:

"In the past, I relied on this skill to defeat countless enemy forces on the battlefield. Do you think, even with the Nine Ring Art, it could only harm the area in front of you?

However, the ancient Itzel Empire had the ability to make these spells affect hundreds of people.

What is it?" Zhao Xu asked with a hint of expectation.

"Martial Magic."
