Chapter 084: Underground Mine

After Zhao Xun agreed to participate in this mission, the four members of Maple Leaf, who were already eager to start, unanimously raised their hands to join in.

In the end, Luo Ya decided to take three of his trusted subordinates, including Hil, a wanderer, Rock, an expert, and Wu Zhen, a warrior, to venture down into the mine with them.

The remaining members, including Zak, were responsible for guarding the entrance to the mine and watching over the contraband goods.

Zhao Xun and Shiren Qingwa separately underwent knowledge and "scholarly" ability tests, but failed to discover any abnormal rumors about this region.

The worn-out marks at the entrance of the mine also indicated that it had been sealed off for many years.

This was the reason why Luo Ya didn't bring too many battle-ready personnel. The greater danger in this underground city was the traps set by the enemy.

However, everyone received replenished equipment from Luo Ya, and Zhao Xun also received 20 arrows specifically designed for his crossbow.

Maple Leaf and Luo Ya, along with Wu Zhen, walked slowly towards the entrance of the mine, their hands gripping their weapons tightly. Maple Leaf occasionally demonstrated the double-handed giant sword he had just received.

According to Luo Ya, these borrowed weapons would be given to them for free, regardless of whether they could retrieve the treasure or not.

This made Zhao Xun slightly more optimistic, as he had heard the content of Luo Ya's transmission, which was limited to those who knew the "transmission art". Perhaps the content of the transmission included a phrase like "no price too high", which is why Luo Ya wouldn't feel that these underground forces could be so generous. The 50GP double-handed giant sword, which was given away so readily, was a testament to this.

"Disassembled?" Maple Leaf looked ahead and asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, after they formed a team, the leader naturally became Luo Ya. The entrance to the mine shaft was surrounded by layer upon layer of wooden bars, with an additional layer of canvas, despite being old and worn out. However, it was still sufficient to hinder them from observing the inside through the cracks.

"Smash it! You two come over and use an axe to break it open," Luo Ya instructed.

The two original guards who were responsible for watching the mine shaft quickly fetched an axe and began to chop at the wooden bars.

"Thud, thud."

After a few chops, the wooden bars were broken open enough for a person to squeeze through.

However, the two of them continued to dig, until the wooden bars were completely broken into chunks and mixed with canvas debris, before Luo Ya and others waited for about ten minutes for the air to circulate. Then, they lit torches and entered the mine shaft.

Meanwhile, the two guards responsible for digging up the debris began to keep watch at the door, without paying much attention to the mysterious curses on the canvas.

The entire team, led by Luo Ya and Maple Leaf, marched in the front row, followed by the two nomads, then the non-combat personnel led by Zhao Xu, and finally the warrior, Wind God, bringing up the rear.

The mine shaft was deep and dark, with broken rocks and a few broken plows scattered on the ground.

Suddenly, the nomad, Rainbow, raised his voice, pointing his torch at the natural stone wall, where a row of blood-red text appeared under the flickering light.

"What does this mean? Is it an expert?" Luo Ya exclaimed, noticing the strange sight.

Although the letters were crooked and twisted, everyone knew that this was not written in common language.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Luo Ya's subordinate, the expert Rock, walked up to the stone wall, holding his magnifying glass to observe the text on the wall. After a moment, he whispered to himself, "This looks like a text from the Netherworld, I need to check it out."

As he began to search through his backpack, a soft voice called out, "Travelers who have strayed, please leave!" The speaker's face was pale, and she gazed directly at the text. "I've studied the languages of the Netherworld, Abyss, and Abyss. All three use this Netherworld text."

Hearing this, everyone's expression changed, and they exchanged uneasy glances. "Yuyue, are you sure you're not mistaken? Or is someone playing a prank?" Rainbow, the carefree adventurer, asked hesitantly.

The Netherworld text is the language of demons and devils, and few people bother to learn it, except for wizards and clergy. Even Zhao Xu, who had chosen three additional languages, had chosen Dragon, Heavenly, and Elf languages instead.

As everyone looked at Yuyue's pale face, they knew she was telling the truth. "Let's continue moving forward. It's just a scare tactic to deter lost adventurers," Luo Ya said, his expression grim but resolute.

The group continued through the tunnel, which was just large enough for four or five people to pass through.

"Did you choose the Abyssal language as your additional language?" Zhao Xu whispered to Yuyue, the cleric beside him.

Most clergy have limited intelligence, and their choice of additional languages is limited. They tend to choose the Heavenly language, which is widely used in the divine realm.

Yuyue shook her head. "I'm interested in languages, so I invested points in 'Language' skills."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu looked at Yuyue with newfound respect.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the first-level spell list, there is a spell called "Linguistic Understanding" that allows them to recognize unfamiliar languages and texts. Considering the strength factor, most people rarely invest in language skills. Only players with a natural talent for languages, such as barbarians, will choose to invest in languages. Players with a profession that only has 2 skill points, such as mages and priests, will not actively learn language skills either. For example, the variant "Monastic Priest" has 6 initial profession skill points. Therefore, players who want to learn languages usually have a high level of focus and dedication, similar to an Arthurian knight. Players like this will find it easier to reach the peak.

Zhao Xu also realized the importance of spells and skills during his adventures and started thinking like a mage. He began to realize that some things that cannot be obviously improved in terms of strength also have significant meaning.

Zhao Xu thought back to his past life and couldn't remember any famous players with his name. However, he did recall a player named "Red Maple Leaf" who was a druid in his past life.

After walking for about five minutes, Zhao Xu and his companions reached the end of the mine tunnel. The view suddenly opened up to a vast expanse.

In front of them was a mined-out area with various holes and trenches, which was the main excavation site of the previous miners. They had to climb down to the lower platform, about 4-5 meters deep, where there was already a broken mechanical hoist hanging down, which the miners used to lift stones from the platform to the tunnel above. No one knew how long the hoist could hold, so Luo Ya directly used a rope to find a crevice in the tunnel entrance and slowly lowered it down.
Here is the translation of the text:

After confirming the surroundings, he let the people above, including Zhao Xu, come down one by one along the rope.

It wasn't until the last person, Wu Zhe, had come down that Luo Ya took a headcount and then the group continued on their planned route.

However, they had only taken a few steps when everyone stopped in their tracks, even Wu Zhe's hands were shaking as he gripped the giant sword in his hand.

On the wall that had just been lowered down, just a few meters away from the spot where they had previously lowered themselves down, there were several dark brown handprints on the corner of the wall.

It seemed as if someone had once desperately tried to climb up from there.
