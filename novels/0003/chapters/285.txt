Chapter 286: The Land of the Damned

After finishing his sketch, Zhao Xu retrieved his dagger and didn't say a word before turning around and leaving.

The "Land of the Dead" had been torn apart after the fall of the god of death, and it had been floating in the starry sky for centuries. Despite the passage of time, only one person, Edmond, had dared to visit this place, and it was unlikely that more than two people would show up.

After Zhao Xu left, this place would be permanently sealed by the Association of Mages, who would use their methods to restrict and compress the existence of the divine power.

It was only natural to think that no one would come to this place for centuries to come, let alone see the words left behind by Zhao Xu.

This was also the reason why Zhao Xu and the "God of Slaughter" had intentionally left behind a message together.

As Zhao Xu walked downstairs, he couldn't help but think about how Edmond had obtained the divine power. As a prisoner who had been imprisoned for over a decade, he had never given up hope and had continued to train his body. Despite being only at the level of a low-level warrior, he had still managed to find and break free from the divine power, becoming the God of Slaughter.

As Zhao Xu thought to himself, he slowly walked down the stairs. He was familiar with 3A-level games and knew that when entering an unfamiliar place, the first priority was to survey the surroundings to ensure safety.

However, he knew that the outside world was in chaos, and even if he made a loud noise, it wouldn't attract attention for the time being. It was only when everything was quiet that any noise could potentially attract the attention of the undead creatures that surrounded the place.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah!" Zhaoxu stomped heavily on the stairs, which had some corroded marks, as if stepping into thin air. His entire body stiffened, and his eyes gazed warily at the dark expanse ahead, which seemed to have no windows at all, unlike the second floor with its translucent curtains.

Although Zhaoxu's "Dark Vision" and "Soul Shield" had been removed after touching the idol, the undead creature itself possessed the characteristic of "Dark Vision", allowing it to distinguish between dark and light.

After a while, Zhaoxu saw that there was no unusual movement, and continued to move forward.

At this time, there were also many crashing and running sounds coming from outside the building, which naturally covered up his own sounds.

So, Zhaoxu did not think that the first floor was free of undead creatures, and instead continued to maintain high alertness.

It wasn't until he turned around and faced the grand hall at the bottom when Zhaoxu's entire body froze.

In front of him, in the grand hall, there were more than twenty undead creatures, hanging in mid-air like corpses, their feet not touching the ground, their upper bodies still slightly human-like, but their lower bodies had turned into skeletal remains. Their eyes were bloodshot, and their mouths kept muttering to themselves.

The dark vision could only see a completely black-and-white scene, and even Zhaoxu almost jumped with fright at this grotesque sight.

However, he was also half-undead himself, and could be considered a "fellow creature" by the undead, so his fearful thoughts were somewhat alleviated.

Zhaoxu took a light step forward.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, a series of "complaints and grievances, accompanied by pain" sounds entered his ears, carrying a kind of spiritual attack that incessantly assaulted his willpower.

However, in the land closest to his soul, Zhao Xu's "undying essence" energy remained firmly intact.

[As an adventurer, Zuko has the "undying creature" ability, making him immune to "hypnosis" effects.]

Zhao Xu realized that he had almost been caught off guard and that his original plan to continue moving forward had come to a halt.

He immediately began using his knowledge (religion) skill to search for information about the undead creatures ahead.

"'Master, this is a 'Wraith'," said Larks, who had been silent for a long time, while sharing the information she knew about Wraiths with Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu also compared the information he had researched to what he had learned.

Zhao Xu didn't know whether he was lucky or unlucky, but he had only encountered a 3-level Wraith.

The "monsters" created by Arthur were self-contained systems, like 1-level ghouls, which needed to increase their life force HD or take on a secondary profession to evolve.

For example, the ancient dragons were 19-level mages who could continue to take on mage professions and increase their mage levels, eventually becoming legendary mages.

At the same time, there was another route, called "templates", where monsters could take on templates, and adventurers could also take on templates.

In the undead creature group, except for some standard monsters like ghouls and mummies, most of them were essentially pre-made products.

Another part of the undead creatures were those that had taken on templates, such as skeletons, zombies, warlocks, and specters, many of whom were career professionals, with abilities and levels varying greatly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Among the "templates" such as "skeletons" that inherit few of the abilities of their previous lives, and "warlocks" and "wraiths" that can inherit most of the abilities of their previous lives. Therefore, wraith sorcerers and warlock wizards are among the most formidable and terrifying undead beings.

The "vengeful spirit" that Zhao Xu is facing is a standard undead being, with a challenge level lower than it. However, Zhao Xu's eyes reveal a hint of hesitation, as the formation of undead beings and the cause of their death are closely related in the standard system.

The rumor about "cannibal ghouls" is that they are usually the result of people who died from overindulgence or bad deeds. "Vengeful spirits", on the other hand, are the ghosts of people who were driven to suicide by others. They are solely focused on seeking revenge against those who drove them to the brink of death, even if they cannot cause real harm.

The "hypnosis" that Zhao Xu just used is actually the effect of the opponent's "supernatural ability".

As long as one enters within a 20-meter range of the "vengeful spirit", they will be attacked by the "mumbling" ability. If one's willpower is not resisted, they will be affected by the "hypnosis" spell, which can last for several rounds.

However, the "hypnosis" spell itself is a coercion element of the "mind control" spell, so undead beings that are immune to the influence of the mind will not be affected.

This is also the reason why more than 20 "vengeful spirits" can coexist peacefully in mid-air without influencing each other's minds. This also allows Zhao Xu to dodge this attack, which is one of the effects of his "ghostly nature". The previous "undead shroud" would not have allowed him to be immune to this kind of mind-influencing effect.

If Zhao Xu had not paid attention, he would have attracted the attention of 20 "vengeful spirits" and would have had to endure 20 layers of cumulative attacks. It wasn't until he successfully resisted once that he could be immune to this kind of supernatural ability for 24 hours.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The problem goes back to its original state.

Like the four-ring spell "Control of the Corpses" that summons undead creatures such as skeletons and zombies, the six-ring spell "Summon of the Dead" can summon standard undead creatures like "Corpse Eaters", "Mummies", and "Spirits".

The "Vengeful Spirit" itself is too rare and the cause of death is too strict, and it's more likely to form naturally rather than suddenly appearing like that. Even in the "Land of the Sleepers", it's the same.

Zhao Xu's gaze shifted to the edge of the wall, and he suddenly noticed the reason why there was no light here. The original doors and windows had been nailed shut, and even the windows didn't let a single ray of light through.

Moreover, the wooden boards above and on the floor were covered with mysterious curses to ward off spirits, although Zhao Xu thought they were almost useless.

But thinking about the characteristics of this city, a sarcastic tone suddenly emerged.

However, just as Zhao Xu was about to use the strategy of "When in doubt, throw a fireball", he suddenly saw a series of blood handprints appear on the sealed wooden boards and floor, as if an invisible creature was slowly stamping them out.

Zhao Xu almost followed the "When in doubt, throw a fireball" strategy, but then he saw the blood handprints gradually disappear one by one.

"Is this a crime scene?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask himself.

"Ha ha, master, it seems that 'Land of the Sleepers' has been forgotten too long, and even wizards like us have forgotten its reputation. Master, do you think this city suddenly appeared?" Larkspur said.

Zhao Xu's mind began to recall the overall layout of the city he had seen in the tunnel.
The entire town looked as if it had been swept by a sandstorm, with dust and dirt covering every inch. However, Zhao Xu suddenly remembered and couldn't help but say, "Many buildings' styles are actually not uniform, it's as if they were forcibly pieced together."

"No mistake, master, the land of the sleeping is where the god of death is in charge, gathering together the sites where Arthur once unleashed the majority of the undead creatures. That's why it's also called the City of the Damned. The building you see is actually building number 0365, the lost guesthouse of the missing tourists."

"Once, a group of tourists were taken away by a group of teenagers while they were having fun, and later they were brutally killed. The location of the incident was in this originally dilapidated house, and after that, the house became a haunted site. Later, the priests and followers of the god of death arrested the perpetrators, locked them up in this house, and nailed shut all the doors and windows, and then performed a ritual, and this house appeared in the city of Anta. Now, Zhao Xu finally understood the context, and as he looked at the "vengeful spirits" floating above the hall, he thought that the perpetrators might also be here.

However, Zhao Xu started to listen intently to the twenty vengeful spirits speaking in hushed tones.

There were various sounds, and it was chaotic, ordinary people would be dizzy just listening to a few sentences, not to mention the "hypnotic" effect, and just the content itself was confusing. Later, Zhao Xu opened his left eye that had just closed, leaving only his right eye, which had the power of "perceiving death", still closed.

"Rakshasa, it's likely that there were hidden circumstances back then."
