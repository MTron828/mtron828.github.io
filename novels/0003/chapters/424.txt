Chapter 425 Lord of the Elements
"Save? Saved?"
That day at KTV, Nan Xiaowei vaguely heard about Zhao Xu adding Wang Ningwei as a friend.
But at that time, the scene of Zhao Xu flashing his phone did not catch her eye.
So she has always thought that this was just a casual acquaintance brought about by being born in the same town. Who doesn't have some "friends" on their QQ or WeChat that they will never deal with again in their lifetime?
However, now it seems a bit more subtle.
Save.
This ordinary word in the game, but in Arthur's case, it seemed so heavy and significant.
Arthur, with an average of five resurrection stones per person, every life was not trivial.
Even at this moment, the remaining questions answered by Wang Ningwei, whom Nan Xiaowei admires, seemed somewhat blurry and insignificant in her eyes.
In fact, those words revealed a message, that Zhao Xu's strength even surpassed Wang Ningwei's?
And Wang Ningwei is also with others, if it weren't for the account "Dongcheng Ling" on the forum, she would even be the top female mage player. In light of this, Nan Xiaowei even began to scrutinize every detail of Zhao Xu and her, becoming familiar to the point of feeling somewhat unfamiliar.
Nan Xiaowei and Zhao Xu were classmates in elementary school, at that time Zhao Xu was full of radiance in the school, leading in all kinds of competitions, and was a frequent visitor to the chairman's podium under the red flag.
But entering junior high school, especially in high school, she realized that outside of her original small world, there were all kinds of outstanding people.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, he was considered exceptional, just like someone else's child in someone else's family, Zhao Xiu. As he rose in social status, the value of his words also gradually decreased.

She used to think that the most exceptional people were those she had not met. However, she soon found out that the neighbor who seemed ordinary had a hidden talent.

At this moment, she couldn't help but laugh out loud, and her gaze towards Zhao Xiu's door became softer.

"...Luo Luo, do you think we can make it there in time?"

Fang Xiu Yue was riding a horse at this moment, having run for dozens of miles, and looked a bit tired. After entering the "Star Fall" town in the winter city, she and her friends, who had taken advantage of the town's rich resources, had risen to a high level.

Even if a horse worth thousands of gold coins was expensive, Fang Xiu Yue and Luo Luo each had one, while Zhang Qi and his girlfriend followed closely behind.

The group of over ten people gathered together, seemingly few in number, but each person was equipped with well-maintained armor and magic weapons that could easily intimidate those around them.

For the villagers who lived in the newly developed village, these adventurers were like a powerful armed force, comparable to the nobles in the town.
Here is the translation of the text:

From the moment Crui and others stepped out of their door to borrow a village to camp, they received warm hospitality from the local villagers. Had they not been preoccupied with the explosion at the Aizhuo Palace, which was more than 100 kilometers away, they would have definitely accepted the villagers' task.

"As I play this game, I feel that the NPCs here are incredibly realistic, as if they were real people. They have their joys and sorrows, and they experience separation and reunion just like us," Zhang Qi said with a sigh.

Just now, they had stopped by the blacksmith's shop in the village to repair their weapons and equipment, which had been damaged in the battle against the goblin. The blacksmith's son had been excited to see them, and he even asked to join them on their adventure. However, his father, the blacksmith, had stopped him, pulling him back into the room.

"He wants to come with us because he can see the repetition of the same day, and he wants to see what's outside," Zhang Qi said with a sigh.

"Ha ha, I'm just feeling a bit emotional," Zhang Qi said, looking at his girlfriend, Feng Ge, who nudged him with her elbow.

"Hey, I'm just feeling emotional," Zhang Qi said, looking at the fading light of day.

According to the forum discussion, the player, Zhong Xia, had already spent over 10 hours on the second level after clearing the first level of the seal. This had led to heated discussions on the forum, with many people realizing that "Aizhuo Palace" was not a dungeon that could be entered by players below level 10.
Many high-level Arthur experts were deterred by the initial anti-magic field and did not enter rashly. By the time they found out the news, the Palace of Azura had already been buried underground, and its whereabouts were lost.

In recent days, countless powerful individuals near the Northern Alliance have taken the risk of not being able to use magic items, and have sneaked into the pit at the center of the explosion.

However, under the anti-magic field, even digging a hole with a shovel was difficult for them. As for other large-scale methods, such as using powerful monsters to dig, they could not be carried out because they could not deceive the landlord power of the Northern Alliance.

"That's a high-level artifact, it's not so easy to obtain," Fang Xiyue couldn't help but retort Zhang Qidao, "if we give out artifacts now, how will other players play in the future? There will definitely be a group of people complaining, suspecting that the game company is distributing artifacts privately."

"Come on, squad leader, your words are just like the first day of playing this game," Zhang Qi teased, and the others couldn't help but laugh at his playful expression.

"Zhang Qi, don't think that just because you're the main tank, I won't dare to lay a hand on you. At least I know that Arthur is not a game for raiding dungeons, and your status is not the highest," Fang Xiyue said.

Only then did Zhang Qi turn serious and said, "Xiyue, since you have this understanding, you should know. The planners of this game company have long been dead, have any of the demands raised on the forum been addressed?"

"Have those tycoons who have a history of spending millions or even tens of millions in other games protested and demanded the most basic resurrection stones to buy or even just a VIP monthly card? It's like no one wants to take their money."
"If it weren't for the limit on the number of high, medium, and low talent points in this game, which forces everyone to keep buying new accounts to open characters with high talent points and barely fleece the players, I would have thought that TC had changed its concept of 'how can you become stronger without spending money'." Zhang Qiyang spoke at length, but the main point was very clear: don't treat Arthur like an ordinary game.

At this point, his eyes couldn't help but light up, "This world is so interesting, if it were real, it would be so much fun."

"I don't want that," another poet and player in the class, Li Tiange, interrupted.

Since Cui Lu and others used the "Falling Star Lake" shortcut to overtake, Li Tiange gradually realized that he and this small group in the class were drifting further and further apart. Therefore, he took the opportunity to join the team for this collective adventure to the explosion center, hoping to witness the emergence of legendary high-level artifacts.

"Why don't you want that? Don't you think this kind of adventurous life is exciting?" Zhang Qiyang was still intoxicated by the admiring looks of the villagers they had encountered along the way.

Unlike a certain game from Poland, where a group of suicidal villagers dared to withhold the bounty for killing monsters.

"Exciting?" Fang Xiyue finally found a flaw in Zhang Qiyang's argument, "That's because you're currently a player in this game who can die and respawn, and can log off whenever you want."

"Do you know why the blacksmith's son admires you? It's because your sword is stained with goblin blood. The kid next door lost his childhood sweetheart to goblins on an outing, and when she was rescued, she was driven mad and committed suicide in the river within a few months."

"In this world, it's a world for the strong, but the strong will still be oppressed by even stronger ones."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If you were born in this world, you would see the Winter City and the Starfall Town, where many refugees have appeared. How would you feel if you're not born in a family with wealth and resources, but instead in a family that can afford to send you to warrior training? As we walk, those who serve as mercenaries are mostly ordinary people with martial arts skills. Think about it."

Feng Xi Yue coldly mocked Zhang Qi, who almost lost his temper, but was restrained by Feng Xi Yue's gentle tugging on his arm. Zhang Qi couldn't help but mutter to himself in a low voice: "It's no wonder he's so handsome and still single."

The group was filled with tension, and only the presence of Feng Xi Yue's girlfriend, Feng Xi Yue, prevented the two from arguing. "Don't say that," Zhang Qi said directly. "If we woke up one day, we might have crossed over to the world of King Arthur, and that would be amazing."

At this moment, Cui Lu also pulled on Feng Xi Yue's sleeve and spoke calmly to the two of them. "Yes, we also have players in our group who are very skilled. If they cross over, they can live well too."

Zhang Qi continued, "This world is the world of Dong Cheng, and it's also the world of the Starry Sky, and even the recent world of Zhong Xia. But it's not our world."

Feng Xi Yue suddenly summarized the hot topics of the two accounts, even surpassing the player goddess Wang Qing Wei.

After all, for a group of players, the ability to play is the most important.

"Yes, yes," Zhang Qi added, as they were already riding horses and entering the Maya Stone Ridge, where giant stones with unusual shapes were stacked everywhere. Even ordinary cavalry had to be cautious when passing through.

"By the way, doesn't Zhao Xu work as a mage in Mystral?" Crui Lu suddenly mentioned this name, "I feel that Mystral has been producing many high-level mages recently."
Here is the translation:

As soon as Zhang Qi heard it, he couldn't help but glance at Cui Lu, thinking that his old buddy had come to visit. He couldn't help but recall the conversation Zhao Xu had with him earlier, where he mentioned that the abbreviation "ZX" was randomly chosen based on his own name.

Ling Feng, who had heard some gossip from Zhang Qi, whispered to him quietly. However, Zhang Qi couldn't help but scratch his head, thinking that this guess seemed to match what he remembered.

And besides, compared to guessing that they were in the same school in Dong Cheng, this guess seemed much more plausible, since the kid was in Mistral too.

...Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had once been the center of attention, was now standing in the final barrier of the elemental seal, his expression grave.

He was no longer in the cramped stone room he had once known, but a mysterious island suspended in mid-air. The entire island had a radius of over a thousand meters, and even summoning giant creatures would not worry about a lack of battlefield space.

In the previous stages, Zhao Xu had continued to strengthen his close-range attack abilities and gradually shifted his spell slots towards close-range attacks.

After surviving for a day, he began to realize that it was difficult to maintain his spell slots for consecutive battles.

When he reached the level of a long-lived elementalist, he was forced to choose to use his golden and silver golems to open the seal, releasing his own golden and silver golems.
In the end, they easily suppressed the counterattack of the four elemental elders with their excellent defensive characteristics and outstanding single-target attack capabilities. In fact, these elemental elders are just ordinary goods that come out at level 11 challenge grade. Zhao Xu had already encountered a difficulty greater than this when he encountered the Iron Golem, so killing them was a piece of cake. It's just that these four elements all have some mobility and escape abilities, so killing them at the same time would give him a headache. At this time, Zhao Xu stood on the island in the void, not knowing where the interface of this world was. But this did not prevent him from constantly taking deep breaths to calm his emotions. At this time, a total of 24 mysterious runes from small to elder level of the four elements have been engraved on his treasure chest. However, Zhao Xu did not feel the slightest sense of celebration. Or, he guessed wrong. Originally, in the second level, he chose the elemental level, and he also wanted to repeat the experience of sealing the golem level, to see if he could get some help from a similar silver golem first, and then use the intermediate rewards to defeat the level boss. Now, on this island, he just has 24 inedible elemental runes. At this time, Zhao Xu silently threw out two legendary golems. As they appeared, the nearly hundred-ton weight suddenly slammed to the ground, as if the entire island was shaking. And at this time, Zhao Xu also took out almost all of his strongest equipment to face the enemy. Because in the previous level, he faced four elemental elders with a challenge level of over 11. This time, he was going to face four completely unimaginable, terrifying beings. Four elemental princes with a challenge level of over 35. Or, as they arrogantly call themselves, the lords of the elements.
