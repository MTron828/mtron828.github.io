Chapter 558: Wishful Thinking, Disappearing Land

As Zhao Xu was using the "Transmission Technique" to transfer himself in a hurry, another group of gods sent their own priests and knights to occupy the desolate wasteland.

The major guilds, including the entire northern region, received an edict from the gods' temple, ordering them to quickly transfer food to the land where humans had descended from Earth.

Some secret societies, mysterious cults, and hidden forces also quietly set out for the destination.

Even the legendary Nine-Ring Transmission Technique, which was said to be as free as it gets, was activated with the support of these powerful forces, targeting a specific location in the desolate wasteland.

Once the transmission array is set up, it can last for 10 minutes per level, although its radius is only about 1.5 meters. Anyone who steps into the circle will be affected by the "High-Level Transmission Technique" and be transported to the designated location.

At this moment, the cost of 1000 gold coins for the spell materials became insignificant.

If Zhao Xu couldn't use the Nine-Ring Technique, he would have to use it himself to transport the entire army.

The transmission array itself can also be combined with the "Magic Stabilization Technique", which is a type of one-way transmission portal.

"What's wrong with Zhongxia?" Wang Congwei asked.

At this time, Zhao Xu was standing on the outskirts of the Starfall Town, which was still under construction, lost in thought.

Just then, the long-absent Aiswixi appeared mysteriously beside Wang Congwei, but she was unusually silent.
Here is the translation of the text:

While Zheng Xin Yin was also arranged by Zhao Xu to be stationed in the rear, some key personnel were quietly selected and transferred to the Starlight Town, a safe area.

Although it had been a month since they were separated, Zhao Xu's return was like a thunderbolt, and he brutally killed a batch of incompetent guards to assert his authority.

He ordered them to transport the remaining food from the granary to the barren wasteland through the teleportation array.

"What's going on?" Zheng Xin Yin noticed that Zhao Xu's expression was off.

"Nothing, it's just that the players disappeared a week ago, so my lordship has been revoked by the Northern Alliance," Zhao Xu said.

"What?"

"It should be possible to reapply for approval," Wang Qing Wei thought of a solution.

"No, the process is too slow, from appeal to reissuance, it will take at least three days," Esvein analyzed.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu stood silently on the high platform, gazing at the buildings of the Magic Association that he had worked so hard to build.

The entire area was as big as a football field and was about to shine with its own glory.

He had spent half of the past four months on this place, and it was not wasted.

"Summer, what are you really worried about?" Wang Qing Wei asked Zhao Xu, who was lost in thought.

"I'm just a bit hesitant," Zhao Xu replied, looking up at the tower.

The wind blew gently, and the sound of rustling leaves and rustling sounds came and went, like an invisible dragon soaring and swooping.

"After we completely cross the boundary, our entire attributes and species will naturally synchronize," he said.

"This also allows my intelligence to truly match the current level."
Zhao Xu turned to look at everyone, "So I was thinking, if we really settle down here, no matter how we convince others, we will still be seen as typical defectors." 

Since ancient times, any organization that has gone into exile overseas after a failed domestic political change has never succeeded. 

Settling down locally, gaining the support of the people, and getting nourishment and replenishment is the most crucial core. 

"So what do you plan to do? Taking advantage of the loss of lordship, are you going to give up everything in the falling star town?" Wang Ningwei asked in response. 

She had already understood Zhao Xu's intention. 

According to the plan, it was Wang Ningwei who was supposed to reorganize the remaining personnel, while Zhao Xu stayed in the "enclave" of the falling star town for development. 

But obviously, Zhao Xu has now abandoned this approach. 

Now that he has synchronized 29 points of intelligence, Zhao Xu has felt particularly strongly the reason why a large number of players from the Blue Star faction would leave for other factions. 

The Zhao Xu of the past naturally had the idea that the safety and comfort of his family were more important, so he sought refuge in the falling star town. 

Including a bunch of his classmates, disappointed with the initial struggle, as soon as they had the opportunity, they left the savage and deadly land where people died every day and turned into undead creatures, and turned to the safe and stable Northern Alliance. 

Not to mention that they had their own influence there. 

Players are like wealthy people who own a "house" in a foreign land. Once there is a problem in the local area, their first reaction is naturally to drive to the safe foreign house, rather than stay and leave it to fate. 

But now, this abrupt change in the short term has shattered everything the players have. 

This change is the most crucial step in Zhao Xu's plan. 

Now, he has learned how to turn the variables in the plan into advantages for his side as much as possible. 

"In that case, it seems that we can only retreat," Wang Ningwei also realized.
They didn't have the "foundation" before, so they never thought about it from this angle, but now, it's different.
"Are you willing to give it up?"
Esvichi, who had undergone special training, now had a completely different aura.
And when she arrived at this place and saw the headquarters of the Mage Association built according to Wang Ningwei's ideas, she understood.
If they really give up, the one who will be most heartbroken is definitely Wang Ningwei.
Even Zhao Xu didn't know how much effort she had put into this place.
But Wang Ningwei decisively shook her head, "One day, we will come back."
Zhao Xu looked at the two and smiled slightly, "We don't necessarily have to give up these magic buildings that we have worked so hard to build."
"Oh? Can you do it?" Esvichi couldn't help but raise her eyebrows provocatively at Zhao Xu.
"It's not me, but someone else can," Zhao Xu said.
With that, he took out a mysterious magic scroll from his pocket.
The scroll, written on the finest dragon skin, instantly made the two female mages feel a stinging sensation in their eyes, as if they were about to cry.
"How is this possible?"
"Isn't it said that because of its special nature, dragon skin easily disrupts arcane writing?"
Precious magic materials were abundant among the mages, but they ultimately chose parchment as the writing medium for the scroll, even for a Nine-Ring Spell scroll worth three thousand gold coins, precisely because of its long-term stability.
"This isn't something from Sis... oh, it should be from Her Highness the Goddess, right?" Zheng Xinyun also covered her mouth in surprise.
"That's right."
Zhao Xu looked at the dragon skin scroll in front of him, which had been carefully wrapped in fine ribbons in the middle. However, through the gaps at the edge of the scroll, one could still see the arcane words on top, emitting a shimmering golden light.

Although he knew that there were no additional traps attached to it, it gave everyone the feeling as if a Soul-Capturing Emblem had been placed, triggering it would cause everyone within 20 meters to fall into a state of mental confusion.

Zhao Xu held his breath and carefully untied the ribbon, then slowly unfolded the extraordinary "magic scroll" in front of him.

"It is a nine-ring spell scroll written by the goddess of magic when she was at the peak of a 35th level legendary mage before becoming a god," Zhao Xu felt the powerful magic emanating from it, his lips turning slightly pale, "It's the... 'Prayer Spell'!"

With that, Zhao Xu flung the delayed dragon skin scroll and carefully examined the mysterious arcane words on it, absorbing the incredibly complex information.

If he didn't have a high enough level of spellcasting ability, he would have long ago been driven to the brink of collapse by the scroll.

At this point, the forces of the entire town were already watching from a distance, secretly speculating on Zhao Xu's next move. Some small families, obedient to certain powerful figures, were trembling in fear, dreading the retaliation of the former lord, Zhong Xia.

The more cautious families had already packed up and were preparing to quietly leave when the chaos provided an opportunity, when the other side was too busy to deal with them.

And more were looking forward to the arrival of the new lord to stop the other's authority.

"What is that? Could it be summoning something?" Outside the headquarters of the Mage Association, someone looked towards the town and discussed.

"Didn't they say he has a white dragon under his command? Could it be that he's trying to summon it back?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"What can we do about it?"
"Don't worry, the elder has agreed to our proposal," the town mayor hastily comforted the crowd.

But the next instant...

Zhao Xu finished gazing at the scroll of prayers and muttered his "incantation", which was actually his "wish".
"I want to include the location of the wizarding association I'm looking at, including this beautiful Star Lake, and also the silver mine area, as well as the temporary storage outside, and send it all to the deserted wasteland."

Zhao Xu looked up and reacted immediately: "Yes, including that area and the temporary storage outside."

At this moment, Zhao Xu was directly and unhesitatingly making a wish that seemed slightly greedy.

As the people who heard this wish were stunned, their scalps felt numb.

"I've noticed that every time I meet you, you're always full of creative ideas," Wang Qingwei said, rubbing her forehead.

It was clear that, as the golden light on the scroll of prayers slowly faded, the scroll's power was beginning to take effect.

"You didn't specify the coordinates of the deserted wasteland, so the implementation of this prayer may be outside the boundaries of Star Town, which is named 'Deserted Wasteland'," Esveg said, accepting his training.

"No," Zhao Xu smiled. "If it were a magic scroll written by other nine-ring wizards, it would indeed be the case."

"But this one was written by the goddess of magic, Sylvina, herself."

Zhao Xu finished speaking.

Suddenly, the ground beneath their feet began to rumble with a loud "boom-boom-boom" sound, as if it was starting to shake.

"I'll be right back."

Zhao Xu smiled lightly and then jumped off the tower.
He, who was able to free fall, was ultimately balanced and stabilized by his flying ability, slowly landing on the ground. At this time, all the residents of Falling Star Town ran out, staring in disbelief at the area where the Mage Association's headquarters was originally located. Several residents couldn't believe it and screamed on the spot, "How did it all disappear?" "The mining area, the mining area is also gone? The tallest flag has disappeared." "Hurry, go check it out!" At this moment, the previously dignified and steady town mayor immediately burst into a rage. Looking down from high above, several areas of Falling Star Town had become empty, with no foundations, as if a piece of the map had been torn off. "Now, it's time for me and you to settle the score," Zhao Xu turned and looked towards the direction of the town hall. "How much food you've eaten, you must spit out as much for me." With that, two heavy legendary golems were thrown to the ground. There was a sudden "thud thud" sound, like the sound of destruction.
