Chapter 12: Magical Positioning

Newbie mages in the Mage Association only learn how to cast spells, just like elementary school students studying exchange and combination laws. However, those who start from scratch and learn the underlying theories are equivalent to starting with the Pythagorean theorem, and they can derive the entire arithmetic theorem system. It's not pointless, but rather unnecessary for now.

Zhao Xu has aspirations, but he can't compare to the native mages in Arthur's world who take several years to reach level 1. Players generally follow the shortcut route and learn how to cast spells directly, just like not learning calculus in high school and directly learning a bunch of derivative formulas instead.

Knowing but not understanding is good enough; otherwise, the top mage in the game should graduate within a year, not a week. The shortcut mages are a privilege given to these Earth players by Arthur.

When players reach Arthur's world a year later, their intelligence value will be upgraded, and they will also be infused with corresponding magical knowledge.

It's only natural that Zhao Xu knows he can cheat a year later and naturally doesn't want to eat this hard nut now.

After crossing over from the previous life, most mage players have spent about a year and a half digesting the knowledge given by the system before they can continue upgrading smoothly. Before that, there were few mages who could upgrade smoothly.

"The teaching methods of the 'Gateway to Magic' and ordinary branch teachings are different," said Annya. "If we really want to mass-produce low-level mages, we have our own means or say local branches are working on such projects."
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, from the beginning, our cultivation goal is to take the legendary mage as a benchmark. There's no need to rush and make you a 1st-level mage immediately."

Zhaoxu looked a bit dazed as he listened to Anzhiya's words, holding the admission letter for the specialized graduate program. He realized that he had to report to school for an eight-year direct enrollment program. Even his current undergraduate degree has a similar feeling. Technical vocational schools are enough for those who really want to work, and their undergraduate courses are more focused on preparing for master's degree knowledge systems.

Most people are just beginners.

Zhaoxu understands and agrees with this approach, and he has already reached the highest level of magic in the wizarding world. However, he doesn't have a small goal. He's just trying to survive.

The question is, he's not willing to endure.

He has the patience to spend more time training, even if it takes several times longer than other players. It's because he wants to learn more spells, touch more powerful hidden skills, and pave the way for future professions.

He can trade time for future strength.

However, his magical knowledge system is not as solid as others. Because the legendary mage's goal is too far away for him to swallow in a year. His knowledge system is solid, he can draw spell models, derive predictive spellcasting structures, and know the release threshold of plastic energy spells, but none of these can bring even a hint of power enhancement to his fireball spell.

To enhance spell power, it's either through leveling up the caster's level or through specialized abilities.

If Zhaoxu chooses to take the route of researching and leveling up his spells, he will certainly be wasting his time.

Unfortunately, he has no choice, except that the earth will only travel to Asia 20 years later.
After understanding this point, Zhao Xu could only wrinkle his brow and read the book with a frown.

It's no wonder that he had never heard of a player from Mistral, as it seemed that all players in Mistral were still in school before crossing over.

Facing this situation, Zhao Xu could only stare blankly, as if he had returned to his high school days, and suddenly felt that the sheepskin cushion on the chair had become harder, causing his buttocks to ache.

"This book on the Art of Magic" would be a simple history of magic if it were simple, and Zhao Xu, who could read with great interest and enjoyment, would not feel any pressure at all, as he could read books on physics, mathematics, and the history of games and comics.

However, this book, which starts from ancient times, only discusses the evolution of magic and repeatedly mentions various mysterious concepts.

After completing professional training, players will determine their skill systems and decide whether to invest points.

However, even if they invest points, they must first meet the requirements of the previous period and then upgrade.

It's like leveling up, which is not just a matter of accumulating experience points, but also requires determining whether to level up or not.

The skill system has many categories, including knowledge, and each category needs to be invested in to upgrade.

If Zhao Xu's knowledge has an adjustment value of over 30, he can perform a knowledge check and try to automatically retrieve some keywords.

At present, he can only treat the opposite side of Anniya as a dictionary-like book to continuously search and read, with extremely low efficiency.

However, Zhao Xu does not know that he can open this book and will not be bewildered by his own mind, and he has already received some kind of protection.
As Zhao Xu delved deeper into his reading, he was able to roughly understand the text without much effort, but the more he read, the more perplexed he became, until he finally reached the point where the magic system of King Arthur was clearly stated, and he felt a profound sense of admiration.

The magic system of King Arthur is unique in that every profession, regardless of occupation, uses a magic slot, not traditional mana values. The number of magic spells each person can cast per day is determined by their profession level, with additional slots granted by attribute values.

Each mage must also rest for at least 8 hours and then meditate for an hour to confirm their magic before they can use it. Mages and priests must also determine what spells they will cast the next day and cannot decide on the fly.

Once used magic slots are depleted, they will not be restored immediately and must rest for another 8 hours before they can be reused the next day.

Mages must record their spells in their own spellbook, and only by doing so can they prepare for their magic. As their magic level increases, the number of pages in their spellbook also increases.

Therefore, unless mages use the Goddess's blessing book to record their spells, they must carry a thick and heavy spellbook with them at all times. If a mage loses their spellbook, they are as helpless as a cook without utensils, no matter how many ingredients they have.

Most mages are exhausted by the task of recording spells, unlike priests, who receive divine intervention and do not have to worry about such trivial matters.

The harsh conditions under which mages operate are what make their magic so formidable, making their spellbooks, expertise, and progress truly awe-inspiring.
However, Zhao Xu was more concerned about what he could choose. According to the traditional rules of the Arthurian Code, new apprentices would be given a free ordinary spellbook, and apprentices could freely copy all zero-level spells onto it. Generally, a zero-level spell would occupy half a page in the spellbook, while a first-level spell would occupy a full page. Additionally, they could choose three free copies from the local wizard association's storage. In those impoverished days, these three initial spells actually determined the initial combat strength of new apprentice wizards. Zhao Xu looked at the book, and he couldn't help but fantasize about which first-level spells he should choose.
