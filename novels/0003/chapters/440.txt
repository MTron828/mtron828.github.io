Chapter 441 Go on an Adventure Together
"It turns out that in the real final scroll space, it is actually like this." Zhao Xu stood in this dilapidated house that was about to be renovated, looking at An Tino Ya, whose face had turned pale, and sighed.
"But it's only because you now have 28 intelligence that you can understand the mystery of magic. It seems that you have gained insight into the power of the gods ahead of time, which is not bad."
An Tino Ya saw Zhao Xu with the same pale face, lips turning blue, his forehead to his pants soaked through, as if he had just experienced a cold and piercing downpour.
She understood in her heart that the other party had broken through that barrier directly at that moment.
At this moment, Zhao Xu, by breaking through the threshold of the fourth ring, also upgraded to level 7, a level that was currently superior to all players.
In the space of the memory palace created by An Tino Ya, Zhao Xu touched the deep insight of the other party in the real space of the final scroll.
It was a near-perfect replica.
The terrifyingly complex and indistinguishable flow of magical information, even after An Tino Ya's filtering, leaving only the strength below the fourth ring, still almost made Zhao Xu feel like he had overeaten, almost unable to digest it.
And at this moment, while Zhao Xu's hands were trembling, his heart was filled with excitement.
It was not because his character had officially advanced to level 7 on the panel, which was already a matter of course for him.
Rather, it was because in An Tino Ya's memory, behind the secret door of the memory palace, he had witnessed the existence of "truth".
Or rather, he had witnessed the existence of the "magic network" from the past.
After the great catastrophe, the magic network was dispersed and disappeared by the magic goddess. The magic network was so powerful that even the divine arts bestowed by the gods still used the channels and pathways of the magic network, saving themselves the trouble of opening new ones. Losing the magic network naturally removed the restrictions imposed by the magic goddess on "man-made network interruptions," but it also meant that the mages lost the opportunity to connect with the embodiment of this magical source. This also led to the mages of later generations mostly being able to only study magic following the "standard spell system." They could no longer, like the mages of the past, comprehend layer after layer of the magic network through their own insights, and explore and understand higher levels of magic. The original mages in the world did not have a magical system left by their predecessors. The mages of the past, when advancing, could sense the "spell structure" from the magic network and directly transcribe those spells into spell books. Unlike the mages of today, who can only honestly rely on "leveling up" to apply for two free spell transcription slots from the association. Losing the magic network also indirectly resulted in the later mages still being able to break through to legendary levels, but finding it extremely difficult to comprehend "legendary spells." Thanks to Antinoya's gift, Zhao Xu can be considered one of the few new era mages who can still access the "magic network" after the great catastrophe. At this moment, Zhao Xu looked back at his heart, and all the fourth-level spells he learned from Antinoya had been completely engraved in his mind. At first, he didn't expect that, outside the projection space of the final scroll, he could also transcribe spells without any loss. Those were hundreds of fourth-level spells.
These four-ring spells, just copying one of them takes a whole day, which is equivalent to saving a year of copying time. 

At the same time, the borrowing and copying fee for each four-ring spell is 200 gold coins (50 gold coins per ring), and the copying fee is 400 gold coins (100 gold coins per page, four rings totaling four pages). 

Unless using a magic item to bless the book, the cost of copying one page is 12.5 gold coins. However, there aren't many wizards who can get their hands on it, and in any case, the borrowing cost cannot be saved. 

By this calculation, he has saved tens of thousands of gold coins in borrowing and copying fees. 

"Teacher, how come I can copy spells from you for free?" Zhao Xu asked. 

His eyes lit up as if he had discovered infinite business opportunities. 

"Of course," Antinoya said lightly, "Wizards with the 'Wise Spellcaster' attribute use mental stimulation as the cost for copying spells. You can copy directly into your mind because of the legendary spell I just cast, which has already cost tens of thousands of gold coins in stimulation materials." 

"Including when you previously entered the projection space of the final scroll to copy the first to third ring spells, maintaining that space itself consumes a large amount of materials. Otherwise, do you think those floating spell books you saw inside were just falling from the sky?" 

"Is it equivalent?" Zhao Xu asked. 

"No, in reality, each spell you copied at that time cost almost as much as someone else copying a nine-ring spell." 

"But it's worth it to save you some time, otherwise, if you had to copy spells honestly, you might not even have completed a single ring spell by today." 

"Teacher, could it be that we really have some connection from a past life?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but be amazed.
The Mage Association can make many ordinary mages bow their heads and honestly apply for membership, which is also linked to the benefit of being able to apply for two free spells upon leveling up. You should know that the one-time borrowing fee for the Nine Rings spell is 450 gold coins, and Zhao Xu casually copying two of them would cost over a thousand. "You're overthinking it," An Tino Ya looked at him with disdain. Zhao Xu found that for some magical items, An Tino Ya sometimes showed more restraint towards him. But for some invisible expenses of tens of thousands or even millions of gold coins, although they cannot significantly improve his strength, An Tino Ya has never been stingy. For example, in the hundreds of four-ring spells he transcribed, Zhao Xu really only needed a few dozen in the end. Most of the spells were probably just familiar to him when he transcribed them. So in the cost of transcribing spells, 95% of the cost of transcribing spells that he will use less than 1% in the future is difficult to increase his strength by 5%. But there's no way, I'm a full-table caster, and that's the most pretentious thing to say in the caster community. When spoken, it truly shocks the world. It can make countless novice mages who have worked so hard to accumulate gold coins and seek to transcribe spells kneel down and cry on the spot, wondering why it's so unfair. "Stop standing there like an idiot, hurry up and check your professional abilities, if your level drops back to 6 later, it would be ridiculous," An Tino Ya lightly poked the dazed Zhao Xu with her finger. Zhao Xu then came to his senses and carefully looked at his character card panel. Profession 1: Level 5 Mage/Level 2 Super Magic Sculptor. Profession 2: Level 1 Priest/Level 4 Scroll Scholar/Level 2 Rune Guardian. He immediately gained the increase in life points and exemptions after reaching level 7.
The key is that he also obtained professional ability along the way.
The second-level ability of the Super Magic Sculpting Law is a brand new "Super Magic Specialty", which he carefully selected later.
The second level of the Spell Guardian has obtained a key ability "Arcane Vision", with the same effect as the spell of the same name.
Zhao Xu himself has accumulated enough, and at the moment when he has also studied the corresponding spell upgrade, he automatically mastered this supernatural ability.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu focused his attention on his own eyes and began to concentrate.
Slowly, in the fan-shaped visual area in front of Zhao Xu, as long as there is "magic light" within a range of 36 meters, all of them enter his line of sight and are automatically marked.
All magical effects will no longer escape his notice.
Zhao Xu has a pair of eyes that can see through "magic".
At this moment, he stared at Antinoya's cloak and began to focus his attention on it.
[Adventurer Zhongxia, you identify the spell on Antinoya's cloak, pass the check, and analyze it as a "protective" magic item.]
The feedback information is very limited, and it is simply not as good as the identification technique of a ring. Zhao Xu secretly thought that this effect was better than nothing.
But he immediately continued to focus on observing Antinoya. "Arcane Vision" can judge the school of magic items through spell identification, which is only the second ability.
It also has a key third ability, and can automatically identify without the need for identification.
At this moment, Zhao Xu is completely focused on the other person, as if he is casting a spell, with all his attention focused on her, as if he wants to forever engrave Antinoya in his memory.
Here is the translation:

"Adventurer Xunxia, you focus your extraordinary vision on Anniya and analyze her magical abilities (standard action). You discover that she possesses the ability to cast spells, with a maximum level of magecraft as follows: Arcana (legendary), Divine Magic (legendary)."

"Double legendary spells!"

Zhao Xun's eyes widened as he analyzed Anniya's magical abilities through his extraordinary vision. He almost rubbed his eyes in surprise.

Even though he already knew, he still couldn't help but exclaim in amazement at Anniya's legendary divine magic.

This means that, aside from the four legendary arcana spells she knows, Anniya also possesses four legendary divine magic spells.

From the first generation of magic goddess to the present, Anniya has mastered countless legendary spells, earning her the nickname "walking nuclear bomb".

"I've finished? This new toy is so much fun, right?" Anniya, now a "Guardian of Incantations", naturally understood why Zhao Xun was scanning her from head to toe.

"You've finished looking at me. I've restored my mental shield. Next time, don't make me think you've got a 'peeking' ability instead of extraordinary vision."

"Ah?"

Zhao Xun was taken aback, then quickly reacted.

He had just gotten excited about obtaining a "new vision".

After all, extraordinary vision is a three-ring spell, and he had only dared to play with it at the black market.

Usually, he would only use the "Detection Magic" with zero rings.

Now he realized Anniya's words implied that extraordinary vision was a divination spell.

Although it would enhance his intelligence gathering abilities, the divination spell itself was within the range of the "Mental Shield" spell, which had a level of eight.

As Anniya reopened her mental shield, Zhao Xun's vision suddenly lost all magical light, as if the colorful world had turned black and white.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, if both professional skills are confirmed to be no problem, let's go. I've already called a horse-drawn carriage outside."

"Noah said, looking back at Zhao Xu.

"Horse-drawn carriage?" Zhao Xu turned around, noticing that there were only himself, Noah, and Veian in the scene, with no fourth person.

"You need to go to the Union's capital to handle the formalities for establishing the association first, and I'll accompany you," Noah said.

"Not by teleportation?"

Zhao Xu's tone was somewhat hasty, looking at his teacher with a hint of unease, as if something was off.

"Can't you appreciate the beauty of the distant scenery?" Noah looked at Zhao Xu with a strange gaze.

"Teacher, you usually travel tens of meters directly using arbitrary doors or dimensional jumps," Zhao Xu joked, feeling that Noah, who took a few steps to use magic to travel, had no right to say that appreciating distant scenery was a good thing.

"What's wrong, Midsummer, do you think sitting in a horse-drawn carriage with me is an unbearable thing?" Noah said, sounding "polite" but actually quite insincere.

"No, I'd love to," Zhao Xu said, as if he could sense the subtle vibrations of the mystical particles in the air.

"That's settled then, let's set out together. We can have some fun and adventure on the way."
