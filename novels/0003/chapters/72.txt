Chapter 73: The Enemy in the Woods

As a subordinate of Caesar, Rak participated in the transportation of the merchant team. As the leader of a group of players, including Zhao Xu and others, Rak met with the person in charge of the smuggling, Luo Ya, and instructed them to follow the 13th wagon. The entire team consisted of almost 20 wagons, with nearly 50 people escorting, with each wagon having a few people assigned to it. The atmosphere in the team was very solemn, as if they were transporting prisoners rather than goods.

When the sunlight became brighter, Rak approached the warrior, Maple Leaf, and whispered, "From now on, the 8th wagon will be under the responsibility of the four Earth Adventurers. No matter what reason, unless Luo Ya gives the order to give up, if you lose the goods, I'll forfeit the deposit. And those who follow us to 'Nan Du' are even more impossible."

When Rak only mentioned the four of them, the wanderer, Rainbow, suddenly called out.

"What about the spellcaster? Isn't he included?" Rak's tone became heavier.

"He's not the same as you, he's just passing by and providing mutual support. He'll also provide magical support when necessary. You've received a bounty, can you be the same?" Rak couldn't help but speak more sternly.

Zhao Xu then glanced at the four of them, wondering if they dared to take on such a risk, and whether the four Revival Stones were worth the bounty this time.

In reality, players often hitch a ride, even the most basic necessities like food and shelter are not taken from the merchant team. When there's trouble, they'll take care of it, and when there's no trouble, they'll just relax and reach the destination.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In addition, you must report the time you are online and offline clearly, and follow the requirements of our team leader, Luo Ya. Once the time is up and we don't see you online for more than half an hour, we will continue moving forward without you. You're on your own to figure it out."

Lak also emphasized this point repeatedly, and Maple Leaf, as the team captain, nodded in agreement.

"Plus, Mr. Zhong Xia, although we don't expect you to stay up all night, I hope you can still stay near the commercial team and sleep, so that when we leave at night, you won't have to worry about being caught off guard."

Zhao Xu nodded in agreement.

In the game, players can sleep at night, but there's a risk of being attacked by monsters. As a result, many solo players will log off immediately after leaving combat and then log back on before rejoining the group. However, our commercial team needs someone to keep watch at night, especially since we need to be prepared to move quickly if we're attacked.

After Lak returned to the front, Maple Leaf began assigning night watch duties to his team members.

Later, the entire commercial team officially set off.

The city of Fuyang was destroyed by the residual effects of a legendary spell, which was centered outside the city. After nearly a century of natural evolution, the area has slowly recovered to become a hilly terrain.

Zhao Xu roughly referenced the map and used his geographic skills to estimate that most of the route we'll be taking tonight will be through a relatively sparse forest. Unlike normal commercial teams that can use the official trade route, our smuggler's team will have to blaze our own trail through the wilderness."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, do you want to sit there?" Team leader Maple Leaf pointed to the corner of the horse-drawn cart, where there was still half a seat available. "No need, Maple Leaf Brother, I'm physically capable," Yu Yu said with a slightly sweaty forehead after walking a few steps.

The horse-drawn carts of this merchant team were basically all fully loaded, with deep wheel tracks and footprints left behind every now and then. It was impossible for Zhao Xu to spare a horse-drawn cart for them to ride in.

However, if Zhao Xu was a 5th-level mage and also provided protection, Leader Luo Ya would definitely spare one. Zhao Xu's 14-point physical quality also guaranteed his mental state for this journey. Generally, people with higher physical quality have stronger endurance.

For Zhao Xu, running 1000 meters might feel exhausting, but for him, 3000 meters would be a breeze. "Yu Yu, do you know that when I was training to be a mage, a good teacher told me that after reaching 5th level, I wouldn't have to worry about setting foot on the ground again," poet Nan Ji Qing Wang said to the girl.

"Why is that?" Yu Yu asked.

"Haha, this one," the poet was about to explain when he suddenly saw Zhao Xu looking around his surroundings and asked, "Mr. Zhong Xia, do you know?"

Zhao Xu, who was thinking about the best escape route, responded unintentionally: "First-level spells have Summon Mount, and third-level spells have Phantom Horse. If the spellcasting level is sufficient, it's almost possible to cover a day's daily route."

"That's right," the poet said calmly, without continuing to speak.

Zhao Xu was about to turn back to look at the other person's expression, but he still managed to restrain himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu muttered to himself, "Could it be that he's trying to test whether I'm really a spellcaster?"

The players are being very cautious now.

Summoning a mount is arcane magic, not divine magic, and only Zhao Xu can do it in this situation.

The three-level arcane spell, "Poet's Arcane", is listed in the spellbook, but it's not possible to cast it until level 8. Zhao Xu wonders if his friend, the poet, can make it to level 8.

If Zhao Xu were to cast the "Summon Mount" spell now, combined with the delay spell from the expertise in time magic, it would be enough to last for about 8 hours. However, Zhao Xu is walking on foot, not riding a horse, because he hasn't mastered the spell yet.

Annie gave him some level 1 arcane scrolls, which are still in his backpack, lying quietly.

Suddenly, the entire caravan slowed down its pace.

The leader, Luo Ya, is at the forefront, and only a few leaders have the right to ride horses. The pace of the caravan is controlled by them.

Zhao Xu looked at the dense forest in front of him, turned back to look at the cargo on the wagon, and quickly activated his "Knowledge" and "Natural Knowledge" skills to ask a question.

This time, Zhao Xu's luck was still good, and he successfully passed the test and directly searched for the answer he wanted.

As Zhao Xu looked at the information panel, he could only sigh and thought to himself, "It's a good thing I can still talk sense into them."

"Did you guys know each other before?" Zhao Xu asked, looking at the wandering rainbow.

The other three shook their heads, while the wandering rainbow thought for a moment before speaking softly, "The old leader who was in charge of this matter has died. He came from another gang to take over the territory and has just taken the position recently."
At this moment, the entire team came to a complete halt, and the four people knew that something was amiss. Zhao Xu could only pin his hopes on Luo Ya Gan, who understood that before making a deal, he should first grasp the situation at each dock. He didn't want to face a group of Druids' wrath.
