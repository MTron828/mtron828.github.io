Chapter 426: The Final Transformation

As Zhao Xu gazed at her with a solemn expression, holding the sacred pendant of the Avenger, Vivian was also holding her breath in anticipation, as if she could feel the intense tremors before a storm.

"Master, do I need to join the battlefield?" Vivian suddenly spoke up after a long silence, which had led Zhao Xu to believe that she had permanently shut down.

"What? You've finally appeared?" Zhao Xu exclaimed in surprise.

"Of course, I wouldn't have appeared if not for the situation," Vivian warned. "If I didn't show up, you might have to give up the Revival Stone."

"How exaggerated is that?" Zhao Xu thought to himself, having grossly overestimated the strength of the Element King, even to the point of being terrified of a 30-level existence.

"Master, it's not that simple," Vivian understood Zhao Xu's misconception.

"Or to put it simply, true legendary monsters are not like the ones you see before you, two golems that are as simple as they seem. They're not like the ones you've seen in the monster manuals and knowledge you've acquired through trial and error. You can't just guess their abilities by looking at their stats and data."

"Or to put it another way, even the data on two legendary monsters on paper is completely similar. The information you've obtained is just one of the lowest possibilities. Master, you've only got a rough idea of their abilities and various damage reduction and resistance abilities."

"You've searched for possible abilities such as life value, attributes, and immunities, but you've definitely underestimated their specific abilities and various damage reduction and resistance abilities."
Here is the translation:

Even legendary monsters that might appear will directly possess the strength of a level 20 priestess, which is not strange at all. As Zhao Xu listened to these words, his face turned increasingly difficult to look at.

"That means I'm going to leave now?"

As he spoke, he felt the air on the virtual island, which was blown gently by the wind, and it had a slightly bitter taste.

"Ha ha, not that extreme. There's no one else here, and this demon saint warrior is trustworthy, so wait until the master uses me to simulate divine power, and it's still possible to fight a bit."

Lakshmi said this, and Zhao Xu sensed the deadly intent behind her words.

It wasn't just a legendary monster on paper.

Zhao Xu couldn't even begin to guess how many additional moves his opponent might have.

"Ah, Lakshmi, since you can transform into a divine item, can you transform into this divine aura as well?"

Zhao Xu had been wanting to ask this question since Lakshmi started responding.

"Yes, I can, but I can't bear the cost," Lakshmi explained. "Unless the master intends to make a one-time deal."

"Uh?"

"Hey, master, don't you know what divine aura is yet?" Lakshmi teased.

Zhao Xu shook his head, thinking back to when May introduced him to this place. He had almost died several times while clearing the levels. Where was he supposed to have the time to speculate and verify things like this?

"That's okay, I don't know," Lakshmi replied bluntly.

Zhao Xu immediately stopped talking, wanting to complain, but he restrained himself.

"This is what I don't know, but that doesn't mean I can't guess," Lakshmi smiled mischievously.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The divine artifact actually has several types. One type is the 'magical equipment' bestowed by the gods, which has divine attributes. Some of these are even the weapons used by the gods before they became gods, and are strengthened by divine power at the moment of their ascension. Another type is a conceptual existence, such as the countless divine artifacts that have been sealed away, capable of destroying the world. Once possessed by an evil entity, they can be used to destroy the material plane. Therefore, most of these are also sealed away like the Holy Breath."

"And the Holy Breath is also a conceptual existence."

"It is the key to the source of chaos."

When Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but mutter to himself.

At this moment, the concept of "chaos" in his mind seemed to reverberate and resonate, like an old box that had been sealed away for a long time, suddenly opened by someone's touch.

Although he was clearly neutral and kind, how could the connection between the Holy Breath and the source of chaos evoke such a strong reaction in him?

Zhao Xu had already experienced the "Source of Knowledge" and "Source of Magic" during his time in the game, but they were inferior to the two highest-ranking sources: the "Source of Order" and the "Source of Chaos".

He had even received a "Double Wash" from Anzhiya, which had imbued him with a hint of chaos. "So, the Holy Breath is also similar to a divine artifact like you, Lakshmi, that can't be used?" Zhao Xu wondered.

"Not at all," Lakshmi laughed, her voice rising. "I'm actually very powerful. And the Holy Breath is even more powerful than you think."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Or maybe it's also a tool that can destroy the world. You can connect the chaotic origin and pour the unbalanced power into the Arther continent, which will inevitably lead to the collapse of this world."

"You think, with the power to destroy the world, you're invincible, aren't you?" Larkus thought to himself.

"This ability is yours now," Zhao Xu sighed helplessly.

He wasn't someone who hated the world, and if he could wipe out the entire Arther, what's the difference?

"Master, at least this saying isn't applicable to you, throwing a mouse at a cat," Zhao Xu thought to himself.

Zhao Xu's expression turned serious, and he thought that Larkus was making sense.

"One day, if he really provokes something that exists, with this kind of power, he's like the person who controls the final button on Earth, similar to a wall-crawling person, who can essentially 'flip the table'."

"That's just thinking, Larkus. We still have to take action." Zhao Xu immediately stopped his daydreaming and thought about how to use the artifact.

"Master, let the demoness mistress control the golden demon, and I'll control the secret silver demon. Otherwise, the demon's combat strength is too low, and it's easy to be controlled by these legendary creatures with dozens of intelligence."

Zhao Xu listened, nodding slightly, "Then you'll control the demon, and the artifact won't change shape?"

"Not at all," Larkus sighed, as if he hated it, "I can separate my body and consciousness. When the time comes, I'll control the demon, and my body will transform into an artifact for you to use. This way, we'll have the best of both worlds. As for the artifact that needs to be transformed, I've already had an idea, and it's aimed at these elemental lords."

"With the power of the death god's fragments, I can barely transform this time, and then I'll collapse for a while. And don't worry, Master, you can seamlessly connect."
Here is the translation of the text:

After finishing his sentence, Zhao Xu couldn't help but want to praise Lakshmi, who was indeed a qualified tool person. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu had been standing there for too long, and he had felt the air grow thicker with the four elements. He immediately briefed Lakshmi on the plan for the next battle and handed over the control of one of the demons to her. After finishing these tasks, Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a deep breath.

Lakshmi's power after absorbing the fragments of divine essence seemed like a super-long-cooled-down ultimate skill. Although it took a long time, each use was absolutely refreshing.

"Master, when you reach the center of the island, the element will appear. However, if you delay it by a few hours, it will also appear. You decide," Zhao Xu listened and remained silent, slowly walking to the central platform at his own pace.

He then lightly stepped on it, giving his answer.

Originally, the island was calm and peaceful. Suddenly, numerous small light balls scattered and accumulated, forming four large celestial gates. These gates began to transform according to their respective connections. The pressure of the four internal elemental layers transmitted from within.

The interdimensional portal was established!

However, Zhao Xu did not see any elemental lords emerging from the large celestial gates. Instead, various auras continued to rise, and ordinary people who approached might be transformed into elemental beings by the original power of the elements. The virtual energy persisted for exactly 10 minutes.
The light gate has been completely transformed, turning into a flaming light gate that is constantly spewing out the fireworks of the inner fire elemental plane. Zhao Xu could only wait silently for this, fearing that if Laxi had transformed the artifact earlier, the transformation time wouldn't be able to sustain the duration of the light gate. At this moment, the four inner plane teleportation gates that had already completed their transformation suddenly rushed from the four directions of the island, and then they merged together. Accompanied by a dazzling light. A huge flame formed in front of him, with long and strong flaming arms extending from its body, seemingly constantly swaying and jumping. The face of this flame had two bright spots emitting a blue light, resembling eyes. The Lord of Fire Elements! Zhao Xu couldn't believe that this was the one who appeared in front of him at first, and the other three did not appear. "Laxi!" As the two legendary mithril and silver golems next to him suddenly rushed forward, Zhao Xu also shouted in his heart, "Artifact Transformation - The Final Scroll."
