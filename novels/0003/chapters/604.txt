Chapter 605: The Ecological Environment of Players

The second sister, "Qing Lu", a priest, couldn't believe that the mysterious mage in front of her was so straightforward, and she was momentarily speechless, her eyes flashing with annoyance as she gazed at Zhao Xu.

"Are all mages really as perceptive as you claim?" Qing Lu asked, her eyes fixed on Zhao Xu.

"It seems that you, Miss Qing Li, are also a mage," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

However, his gaze at the priestess was tinged with a hint of pity.

These players who initially entered the game with a simple role-playing mindset, and then crossed over and changed their affiliations, would naturally face the consequences of violating their original intentions.

It was as if Zhao Xu had just fallen into the demon-possessed zone, equivalent to a high-level civilian. Of course, he would still possess more "weapons" and "armor," strictly speaking, a high-level infantry.

As for the group of priests who did not conform to their original affiliations, they would be even more miserable, as they might face punishment from their original church.

Ordinary priests who deviated from the teachings of the gods could still use the "Expiation Art" to make up for their mistakes.

However, in this situation, unless Qing Lu was willing to succumb to darkness, it would be impossible to recover.

"Not to be pitied," Qing Lu said haughtily.

"I didn't say I pitied you," Zhao Xu shook his head, "but really, if that's the case, you'd be better off leveling up and starting over from scratch, otherwise, you'll have no hope at all."

With that, Zhao Xu continued walking towards the darkness ahead.

It was as if he had said all he had to say.

Especially since they weren't a team brought in by bodyguards, he didn't have any intention of continuing the conversation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey!"

Suddenly, the quiet and reserved Xinlin Guest, the youngest of the three sisters, Qingyu, shouted to Zhao Xudao, "Did you also experience the recent anti-magic scene? There might be more anti-magic scenes hidden here, won't you keep company with us?"

"Oh?" Zhao Xudao turned his head suddenly.

At this moment, he walked to the back of the three sisters and the stone floor was still radiating the magical glow from the "Luminous Technique".

In an instant, the originally difficult-to-see face of Zhao Xudao, who had over 30 points of charm, revealed his true appearance.

He was still carrying some sort of extraordinary and deadly attraction, which instantly left the three sisters, who were accustomed to big waves and strong winds, with a sense of shock and suffocation, and they remained silent for a moment.

"Do you want my help?"

Zhao Xudao asked with a playful smile.

"Yes," Qingli, the female wizard, nodded directly and unexpectedly.

"I think this stage, we shouldn't hope to find the secrets of the underworld and redeem the reward of Yashan."

"The adventure level here has exceeded our level, so, Master Lone Star, let's cooperate to safely leave this place, okay?"

"And now, we're not like before, we only have one life left, and once we lose, there's no revival stone," Qingli said with a very polite tone, as if begging.

"It's obvious that the three sisters who started didn't think they would go on an adventure, holding on to the idea of leaving at any moment, but they didn't expect fate to play a trick on them.

One anti-magic scene knocked out almost all players, directly sending everyone into this teleporter.
Here is the translation:

"Did you post a reward?" Xiaoning was taken aback for a moment, "I remember that these underground exploration missions did not publicly post a reward."

At this moment, the dark and profound underground cave reverberated with Xiaoning's questioning voice.

Just as Xiaoning finished speaking, he suddenly reacted and looked at the three people with a hint of surprise in his eyes, "Are you 'roots'?"

At this moment, the situation in Ailan was extremely complex. On one hand, many high-level players had risen to the challenge, even if they didn't have this idea themselves, they would be pushed by their family and friends around them.

For them, this was a chaotic situation.

Therefore, Wang Qingwei and Xiaoning were secretly recruiting "player guilds" in the dark, without openly incorporating them into their organization, but instead acting as "spies".

In Ailan's confidential files, these guilds being secretly recruited were referred to as "roots".

Hidden beneath the soil, yet able to nourish the great tree.

"You're really from Ailan's official side?" The three sisters finally revealed their surprise.

Xiaoning also smiled wryly.

As the saying goes, one thing doesn't bother two bosses. Since Ailan had secretly arranged personnel from "Qingwei's Sword" to enter this cave, naturally they wouldn't intentionally arrange personnel to come over.

Or, he might be the one arranged, definitely knowing the other's existence, and wouldn't initially behave so strangely.

It's no wonder the other party, obviously from the same faction, initially behaved so coldly, pretending his self-introduction was just a casual remark.

"So, we're teammates now."

Instantly, Xiaoning's tone also lightened up, as they were all working for Ailan, and he naturally wouldn't abandon them.

When he said this, the three sisters couldn't help but relax.
Here is the translation of the text:

Presently, in this underground cave where you can't even see your fingers, you might run into another player, who is also a powerful 5th-level mage, and it's as if you've run into an old friend.

"Let's talk about your situation. Are you three people who came in together?" the mage Clearing asked, and then began to recount their experiences.

However, Zhao Xiu's brow furrowed as he listened.

He had never thought that the other party was not from the same cave as him, but was actually from another cave in the western part of Yanshan.

This suggests that these densely packed and bottomless caves in the wilderness might all lead to the same place.

Therefore, it's possible that this is not the true source of the Undead Tides.

What bothered Zhao Xiu was that this time, the three leaders of the Rose Sword, accompanied by a team of adventurers entrusted by Yanshan, had come down together. However, they did not arrive at the same moment, and ended up in different locations.

This team of adventurers was also tasked by Yanshan to come, and if Zhao Xiu met them, he would have to help them escape together.

"That's right, follow me," Zhao Xiu instructed directly. "If we encounter danger, don't run wildly, I can handle it."

Of course, assuming that there are no divine beings down here.

"Mr. Lone Star, you're still standing on us, aren't you?" Clearing said, standing up at this moment. Although she had lost her magical abilities, her expertise in armor had not been lost. She was the one with the highest defense ability on the scene, and her life value was also decent.

Zhao Xiu then smiled slightly and said, "Why don't you try hitting me with your hammer?"

"Uh?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Pastor Qinglu didn't expect Zhao Xu to request this, but her carefree personality didn't give her any pause. She simply gripped the iron hammer and swung it at Zhao Xu.

In an instant, she felt that her hammer hadn't even approached the opponent's body before it had deviated, as if pulled by some miraculous force.

"Understood, let's follow me," she said.

"This underground cave must have a teleportation portal at the bottom, which would allow those 'undying creatures' to successfully reach the desolate wasteland. Let's go find it."

Zhao Xu didn't want to explain too much, as it would waste his energy.

In traditional online games, stacking absolute numbers can make monsters unable to move.

High-level players often encounter situations where they miss attacks from low-level monsters.

However, as the real-world Arthur, it seems impossible for such ridiculous things to happen, but the existence of magic makes it possible.

Generally speaking, it's difficult for ordinary people to break through Zhao Xu's defense. To do so, they would have to penetrate the "bias force" brought by his charm, which could deflect most attacks.

Next, they would have to break through the "invisible force field" generated by his "Sage's Robe" and "Shield Technique".

Even if they broke through these two forces, there would still be Zhao Xu's natural defensive abilities.

These were all based on the premise that Zhao Xu had voluntarily given up on dodging and lost his sense of agility, martial arts waistband, and sensory abilities.

Not to mention that he also had the "Star Cloak" for reflective damage reduction and "Damage Reduction" ability to defend against the last hurdle.

Therefore, in general, physical attacks against Zhao Xu would be unable to cause damage, making them "low-level attacks" in most cases.
After the three of them clarified their relative strengths, they followed Zhao Xu's lead in earnest. "Can you see?" Zhao Xu asked, his gaze fixed on the dark vision, walking through the darkness without a hint of uncertainty. It was as if he had a thermal imaging device, presenting a black-and-white scene around him.

When he asked his question, the three sisters shook their heads in unison, all of them choosing the human race and naturally unable to see at night. The female mage, however, hesitated to display her dark vision spell.

"Since you can't see, why don't you light a lamp?" Zhao Xu asked, sounding suspicious that he was with three elementary school students. "The Lone Star Mage, lighting a lamp in the dark night, we're easy prey for monsters. Undead creatures are born with dark vision."

Tourist Clear Rain reminded her, saying, "My nemesis is the undead, and I'm well aware of their weaknesses."

As a 1-level and 5-fold level of the "Nemesis" profession, when facing nemesis creatures, aside from the key skills, damage could also be increased by 2 points, and the same nemesis could be repeated to continue stacking.

However, compared to Zhao Xu's unlimited "Knowledge of Devotion" and "Dark Learning" abilities, the difference was more than one level.

"It's just that we didn't bring a torch," Clear Dew explained awkwardly at this moment.

"Give up," Zhao Xu said, lightly tapping Tourist Clear Rain's longbow.

"Shining!" Instantly, this three-ring spell added to the bow, shining brightly like daytime, instantly dispelling the darkness and making the entire cave bright and clear like the ground.
The piercing light also directly startled the group of bats hanging upside down in the sky, and they flapped their wings to fly away to a deeper area.

"Master Star, how can you disregard the precepts of the law?" The originally dignified female mage, Qingli, was astonished.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu furrowed his brow and asked, "When did I write the precepts of the law?
