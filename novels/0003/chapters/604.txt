Chapter 605: The Ecological Environment of Players

The second sister of the three sisters, Pastor Qing Lu, was taken aback by the mysterious mage on the opposite side, who was directly targeting the core. She looked at Zhao Xu with annoyance and resentment.

"Ah, so every mage is indeed extraordinary in their observations?" Pastor Qing Lu sighed, looking at Zhao Xu with a sense of pity.

"It seems that Miss Qing Li is also a mage," Zhao Xu said with a smile.

However, his gaze at Pastor Qing Lu was tinged with a hint of mercy.

These players who originally started playing for fun and then became entangled in a different faction, violating their original nature, naturally had their identities changed after crossing over. They were equivalent to a high-level civilian, just like Zhao Xu, who had just fallen into the demon realm.

Of course, they would possess more "weapons" and "armor" than ordinary civilians. Strictly speaking, they were high-level infantry.

As for the group of pastors who failed to conform to their faction, they were even more tragic because they might face punishment from their original church.

Generally, pastors who deviated from the teachings of the gods could still use the "atonement technique" of the Five Rings to rescue themselves.

However, in this situation, unless Pastor Qing Lu was willing to fall into darkness, it was impossible to redeem themselves.

"Not necessary to sympathize with you," Pastor Qing Lu said proudly.

"I didn't say I sympathized with you," Zhao Xu shook his head. "However, if that's the case, it's better to restart from scratch. Otherwise, you'll have no hope at all."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he walked towards the dark ahead. It's just a coincidence that they met.
Especially since they were not a team escorted by bodyguards, he didn't have any more thoughts of continuing the conversation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey!" Suddenly, the quiet Linkei, the youngest of the three sisters, called out to Zhao Xudao, "Have you also encountered the anti-magic zone just now? There might be other anti-magic zones here, too. Can you keep the secret and accompany us?" Zhao Xudao turned his head suddenly.

At this moment, he walked to the back of the three sisters, and the stone on the ground was still radiating the magical glow brought by the "Lightning Technique".

Instantly, Zhao Xudao's true face was revealed, which was difficult to see due to the backlight. He had a charm of over 30 points, and his body still emitted an extraordinary and deadly attraction force. The three sisters, who were accustomed to big waves and strong winds, were shocked and taken aback, and they didn't speak for a moment.

"Want me to help?" Zhao Xudao asked with a playful smile.

"Yes." The female mage Qingli nodded directly and unexpectedly.

"I think we shouldn't hope to find the secret of the underground and redeem the reward of Yanshan at this stage," Qingli said with a tone of utmost politeness, as if begging.

"Furthermore, the adventure level here has exceeded our level, so let's cooperate to safely leave from here, Starlight Mr."

"And now, we don't have the luxury of multiple lives. If we lose, there will be no revival stone."

It was clear that the three sisters had initially planned to come and go at will, but they didn't expect the situation to turn out this way. One anti-magic zone, and it was a knockout blow to almost all players, causing everyone to directly fall into this portal.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Aiyuan offered a reward?" Zhao Xu was taken aback for a moment, "I remember that these underground exploration tasks did not publicly offer a reward."

At this moment, the extremely deep and mysterious underground tunnel directly echoed Zhao Xu's questioning voice.

Just as he finished speaking, Zhao Xu suddenly realized and looked at the three of them with a hint of astonishment in his eyes, "Are you guys from...?"

At this moment, the situation in Aiyuan was extremely complex. On one hand, many high-level players had risen to the challenge, even if they didn't have such thoughts, they would be driven by their family and friends.

For them, this was a chaotic arena.

Therefore, Wang Qingwei and Zhao Xu were secretly recruiting "player guilds" in the shadows, and they didn't publicly register them under their jurisdiction, but instead played the role of "spies".

In Aiyuan's secret files, these guilds being secretly recruited were codenamed "æ ¹" (root).

Hidden beneath the soil, yet able to nourish the big tree.

"Are you really an official sent by Aiyuan?" the three sisters finally revealed their astonished voices.

Zhao Xu also smiled wryly.

As the saying goes, "one person can't manage two masters". Since Aiyuan had secretly arranged for personnel from "Rose Sword" to enter this tunnel, naturally, they wouldn't arrange additional personnel to come.

Or maybe he was sent, and he definitely knew about the other's existence, but he wouldn't initially behave so coldly.

"It seems we're teammates now."

Instantly, Zhao Xu's tone also relaxed, as they were all working for Aiyuan, and he naturally wouldn't abandon them.

When he said this, the three sisters couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.
Here is the translation of the text:

Deep in the underground cave where one can't even stretch out their hand to see their fingers, it's possible to encounter another player, a powerful 5th-level mage who's almost like an old friend. "Let's talk about your situation," the mage, Qing Li, said, "Is it just the three of you who came in?" Qing Li then went on to recount their experiences. However, Zhao Xu's brow furrowed as he listened, completely taken aback.

He had never thought that the other party wasn't from the same cave he entered, but rather from another cave on the other side of Yanshan. This meant that these vast and intricate underground caves might all be connected to the same place.

This realization made Zhao Xu's head ache. This time, the three leaders of the Rose Sword, along with their team of adventurers, had also arrived. However, they didn't enter the transmission portal at the same time, resulting in different drop-off locations.

The team of adventurers was sent by Yanshan and Zhao Xu would have to take them along to rescue them if he encountered them. "Follow me," Zhao Xu ordered directly. "If we encounter danger, just don't panic and I can handle it."

Assuming there aren't any half-gods down here.

Just then, Qing Lu stood up and said, "Mr. Lone Star, you're still standing on us." Although she had lost her divine magic, her expertise in armor remained intact. Her defensive abilities were the highest in the room, and her HP was decent.

Zhao Xu smiled slightly and said, "Try hitting me with your hammer and see what happens."
"Uh?"
Here is the translation:

The female pastor Qing Lu didn't expect Zhao Xu to ask for that, but her adventurous nature didn't give her any hesitation. She grasped the hammer and swung it at Zhao Xu.

In an instant, she felt her hammer hadn't even reached Zhao Xu's body before it veered off to the side, as if drawn by some kind of magical force.

"Understood, let's follow me," she said.

"This underground cave must have a portal that allows 'immortal creatures' to reach the desolate land. We'll go find it."

Zhao Xu thought explaining too much would waste his energy.

In traditional online games, even if you pile up absolute numbers, you can still trap small monsters in a state of paralysis.

High-level players often encounter scenarios where they get hit by Miss attacks in low-level monster packs.

However, as a true-world Arthur, it seems impossible for such a silly thing to happen, but due to the existence of magic, it becomes "possible".

For most people, breaking through Zhao Xu's defense would require penetrating the "biased force" brought by his charisma. This force can deflect most attacks.

Next, they would need to break through the "invisible force field" generated by the "Great Sage's Robe" and "Shield Technique".

Even if these two forces are broken through, there is still Zhao Xu's innate defensive ability.

All this is based on the premise that Zhao Xu has given up evading and lost his agility and martial arts belt's awareness ability.

Not to mention, he also has the ability to reflect and reduce damage with his "Star Cloak" and "Damage Reduction" ability.

Therefore, in most cases, Zhao Xu's physical attacks are already ineffective against most players and ordinary Arthur monsters, making them "low-level attacks" that cannot cause damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the three of them figured out their relative strengths and weaknesses, they followed Zhao Xu's lead honestly.

"What can you see?" Zhao Xu asked, his eyes fixed on the dark vision, walking through the darkness without a single question.

It was as if he had a thermal imaging device, and the scenery around him appeared in black and white.

When he asked the question, the three sisters all shook their heads in unison. As humans, they couldn't see in the dark, and the female mage couldn't bear to use the dark vision spell.

"Why can't you see?" Zhao Xu asked, somewhat suspicious that he was with three elementary school students.

"The Lone Star Mage, lighting a lamp in the dark of night, we're easy prey for monsters," Clear Rain reminded him, her head held high. "I'm very clear about their weaknesses."

As a 1st-level and 5th-level "Foe" profession, Clear Rain's skills could be upgraded by 2 levels, and the damage could be increased by 2 points. However, compared to Zhao Xu's unlimited "Knowledge and Devotion" and "Dark Knowledge" abilities, the difference was more than one level.

"It's just that we didn't bring a torch," Clear Dew explained awkwardly.

"Gotcha," Zhao Xu said, lightly tapping Clear Rain's longbow.

"Lighting spell!"

In an instant, this three-ring spell was boosted, releasing a blindingly intense light that instantly dispelled the darkness around them, making the entire cave as bright as the daytime.
Here is the translation of the text:

The piercing bright light also directly startled the bats hanging upside down from the sky, and they flapped their wings to fly deeper.

"'Sir Lone Star, how can you not follow the principles of the wizarding code?" The originally dignified female wizard, Qingli, was astonished.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu furrowed his brows, when did he ever have a face as big as this, writing a strategy for the wizarding code?
