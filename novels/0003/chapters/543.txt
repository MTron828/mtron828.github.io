Chapter 544: The Prophecy of the Giant Dragon, Meteorite of the Moon

After Zhao Xu told Wang Qingwei the secret of crossing the world through a phone call on that night, the barrier between them disappeared completely. If I had to describe it in one sentence, it would be like the closest of comrades.

At this time, the periphery of the association's stationed area was crowded with people, and the person in charge of station construction, Lola, had to stop working to welcome the high-ranking officials from the small town. However, the intention of everyone was to try to contact Zhao Xu through his secretary to learn about the purpose of the transmission portal in advance.

As for the transmission portal craftsmen from Mysterra, who had come from thousands of miles away, they were even more vigilant and treated themselves like dumb people, not saying a word.

But no one knew that at this moment, the scorching hot Zhao Xu was actually relying on a door and having a crucial discussion with Wang Qingwei on the side.

"Potential points?"

Wang Qingwei listened without hesitation, and the meaning was self-explanatory.

Both of them were clear that having potential points meant their significance was naturally limited.

However, the second way to obtain potential points meant it could be transmitted.

The third and fourth players with potential points could replicate themselves, which was unparalleled.

"Wang Zhong, this thing must be handled with great care," Wang Qingwei advised.

Potential points could restore spell slots, which was almost like exploiting a loophole in the world's rules.

However, the number of people with potential points was small, and among them, the number of mages was even fewer.
Here is the translation:

Mages who have the potential points can also reach the fifth ring, and they will get another discount. The last few rare individuals who have these abilities will also have a way to learn the "Unbridled Hero's Spirit" spell, which is extremely rare. This is also why this back door can be preserved, unlike the "Swift Burst" spell that can be learned immediately, which is heavily suppressed. Because the threshold is too low, it's just a two-ring spell. However, if Zhao Xu's method is spread out, it will lower the threshold and ultimately bring harm to these beneficiaries.

It's not that she's selfish, but rather that it involves a gigantic class of beneficiaries. It's the entire group of mages who are exploiting the Arthurian loophole.

"Don't worry," Zhao Xu said. "It's just that you also have 'potential points' that I'm telling you about."

"Simulating expertise is not inferior to restoring spell slots with powerful potential points," Zhao Xu said.

Many specialties are like a chain, and to simulate them, you need to spend two potential points.

"What is it?" Wang Qingwei asked, her eyes shining with anticipation.

"Remember, Qingwei, you owe me a debt of gratitude," Zhao Xu joked.

"It's a debt of many," Wang Qingwei smiled.

Then Zhao Xu's expression turned serious, and he extended two fingers. "There are specialties, and you can obtain potential points."

"The first specialty is 'Dragon Seer'," he said.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu's eyes looked out the window, gazing at the newly completed high tower above, where the craftsmen were hanging from above, using a chisel to carve out the emblem of the Eight Great Schools.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In most areas where Arthur is concerned, from the endless blue sky to the filthy and dark cave depths, there are symbols hidden. In ancient times, the legendary dragons observed the symbols around them, trying to find the meaning of these natural signs and try to obtain the legendary 'Dragon Prophecy' omen."

"With this expertise, we can track and decipher the records of all things, just like the legendary dragons, and realize what will happen."

"So, after acquiring the 'Dragon Prophecy' expertise, we will be able to trigger a predictive ability - 'Prophecy Enshrinement'."

"The prerequisite for this expertise is: 2nd level of Secret Knowledge, Dragon Language."

As Wang Congwei watched, Zhao Xu suddenly raised his fist high, and then his entire body began to radiate a mysterious aura.

At this moment, he seemed like a prophet, his eyes lost focus, as if he had gazed into the river of fate.

Immediately, Zhao Xu extended his finger, lightly pointing to Wang Congwei's forehead, just like that.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have awakened the 9th level character expertise: Dragon Prophecy, and obtained the 'Prophecy Enshrinement' ability.】

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you have executed 'Prophecy Enshrinement', with a bonus of +1 insight value. Duration: 3+1/2 Secret Knowledge = 9 turns.]

In an instant, Zhao Xu saw that he had reduced the number of times he used Prophecy Enshrinement from 8 (level / 2 + Perception adjustment) to 7.

At this moment, he was also in this state, except for the slight 1-level increase, he seemed to have also seen the unusual aspects of these mysterious symbols.

"The second key expertise is called 'Prophecy Hero'."

"It is a prerequisite for 'Dragon Prophecy', and its effect is that, whenever in the 'Prophecy Enshrinement' state, one will receive 1 action point, which is also the key to triggering 'Unbridled Hero Spirit'."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just then, Zhao Xu continued to lift his hand, drawing a complex gesture, which seemed to convey an immortal meaning to Wang Qingwei.

"Potential Point Simulation: Prediction Hero."
【Adventurer Zhongxia, you activate the "Prediction Hero" specialization (potential point simulation).】
【Adventurer Zhongxia: You gain 1 temporary potential point (Prediction Hero), lasts for 9 rounds】
At this moment, the numbers on Zhao Xu's panel also changed to:
Potential Point: 9 + 2 (temporary)
Zhao Xu then explained the details of his second specialization, "Prediction Hero".

After listening, Wang Qingwei took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

"Use a 'Prediction Ceremony' ritual action that lasts almost a round of time to activate a 1-point temporary potential point, which is difficult to replicate in battle. Therefore, it can only be used to start 'Unbridled Heroic Spirit' and similar dual specializations."

As Wang Qingwei spoke, she looked at Zhao Xu with curiosity, "However, it's a big sacrifice for you, even though the second Prediction Hero can simulate potential points, the cost of a specialization is not always worth it."

If there are no potential points, players need to learn the "Giant Dragon Seer" and "Prediction Hero" specializations to obtain potential points. Not to mention two, even three would be worth it.
This is the significance of "potential points".
It's like communicating infinite possibilities.
But Zhao Xu just lightly patted Wang Qingwei's shoulder, "The use of simulating two specializations at the same time, you'll slowly get used to it."
"And we have specializations, which can be washed away."
"It's impossible."
Here is the translation of the text:

Wang Congwei's expression changed to one of incredulity, "After the great calamity, returning to one's original strength and re-selecting one's specialty in the 're-training' is unheard of."

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, remained silent, directly pulling out a scroll case from his backpack and handing it over.

Wang Congwei opened the scroll with a puzzled expression, "What kind of material and length is this? It's beyond the seventh ring of magic!"

In the next moment, her eyes were completely captivated, even her voice trembling slightly.

"How is this possible?"

The scroll recorded two eighth-ring spells, "Abandon Chaos" and "Return to Chaos", which was a scroll that could cast these two spells.

Now, the Wang Congwei holding the scroll was even willing to bet that she could cast these two spells.

"Indeed, it's hard to believe, but Congwei, you should understand this now."

Zhao Xu said, looking out the window at the half-circular stone door frame being built, which would serve as the base for the future teleportation portal.

"Magic is Arthur's first productive force, you know."

"We mages are, by nature, cheaters in this world."

"This scroll is your birthday present."

...

The Celestial Observatory.

"What's strange is that the 'Flash Explosion' phenomenon on the moon has been happening quite frequently lately."

A researcher wiped his hand mirror and carefully examined the analysis report in his hand.

Another researcher turned his coffee cup around, sniffing the aroma wafting from above, "Meteorite impacts on the moon are actually possible every day. So, what's the big deal?"

Since amateur astronomers observed mysterious bright spots on the moon years ago, astronomers have joined the research and speculated that these "moon flashes" are actually meteorite impacts on the moon.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to Earth, the moon has no atmosphere, and when meteorites fall, they directly hit the surface without any friction protection. This is one of the reasons why the moon's surface is pockmarked.

"But what we observed is different," someone said. "The last time we observed it, it was during the lunar eclipse last year."

The researcher sighed, "When will our 'Moon Impact Detection and Analysis System' project be approved?"

"You just wait, and it will be approved by the end of the year," someone replied.

Just as they were talking, a bright flash suddenly appeared on the moon's surface. This excited amateur astronomers around the world who were eagerly observing the moon with their telescopes and recording the moment.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was sitting on the rooftop of his dormitory, sipping hot tea and enjoying the gentle evening breeze.

To the naked eye, the moon was still radiant and round, like a jade disk. However, he was well aware that his days on Earth were numbered.
