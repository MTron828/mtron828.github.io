Chapter 177: Mysterious Spiritual Body

Zhao Xu was cautious and controlled his pace, not wanting to rush forward. He kept a close eye on the strange shadows, ready to unleash the "Fireball Technique" with his eternal magic wand at the slightest anomaly. However, the strange movement of the bushes seemed to have ceased, and there was no unusual noise.

As Zhao Xu approached the bushes, he was on high alert, cautiously probing the area with his wooden rod. But there was nothing out of the ordinary. It was as if a small animal had disturbed the bushes and then left.

The sound of rustling leaves and the creaking of branches carried through the forest, accompanied by an eerie and haunting atmosphere. This was a typical phenomenon that often occurred in rural areas at night, which could be intimidating for novice sorcerers.

Zhao Xu, however, felt a strong sense of safety with his near-immune physical damage cloak. Wearing this cloak, he was like driving a car and could navigate through the forest with ease. Adding his camouflage technique, he was virtually unbeatable.

Suddenly, a crow flew out from the depths of the forest, heading towards the sky. After seeing this, Zhao Xu abandoned his idea of circling the bonfire and continued to move in the direction the crow was flying.

Thanks to his dark vision, he could clearly see the crow's location. The path ahead narrowed gradually, with dense bushes and thickets pressing against each other. Zhao Xu had to make an effort to cross over them.

After crossing a stream, Zhao Xu discovered that he had arrived at a cemetery. Besides a few scattered tombs and a few scattered earth mounds, most of the area was a desolate and orderly arrangement. At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyebrows jumped.
Here is the translation:

His gaze swept over the tombstones, settling on the distant forest, where flames flickered. It was an unusual place to hold a bonfire party, to say the least. At this moment, Zhao Xu lightly pulled out his sacred emblem, applied a few protective charms to himself, and then crouched low to the ground, facing the front.

He didn't stop until he was close enough to realize that in front of him were five or six young men and women, aged around ten or so, sitting around the bonfire, with a makeshift pattern made of stones arranged on the ground. The mysterious bonfire in the center seemed to flicker and dance, exuding an air of mystery.

"This incantation is so awkward to recite," one of the slightly plumper young men complained.

Next to him sat a woman with a complexion like a ripe peach, who gently tugged on the young man's sleeve, indicating that he should not speak out of turn. The woman's attire seemed to be from the nearby Women's Academy, where many noblewomen sent their daughters to receive cultural education.

The tall and thin man standing in front of the bonfire was holding a book, with a golden-rimmed glasses perched on his nose, looking grave.

"Let's all recite this incantation together, and then Lisa will hear our call," the tall man said.

"Souls of the damned, eternal monarch of darkness, wandering saint of the end of days..."

Zhao Xu was shocked to see that the inhabitants of Arthur were performing a magic ritual. However, he didn't immediately guess that the ritual was either a resurrection or a summoning of the dead. Generally speaking, the two were often the same outcome when a normal person performed the ritual.
Zhao Xu didn't expect to find a group of nearby college students who had nothing to do after eating and decided to come to the remote tombstone forest to perform a magic ritual. Are they not afraid of getting into trouble?

Zhao Xu noticed that the 31 candles on the outer circle were already half-burned, and some wax tears had even stuck to the ground. These 31 candles were like nails, firmly stuck to the ground.

This indicated that the ritual had already been going on for half the time, like a ship that had already sailed across the ocean and was not easily pulled back. Any interruption in the ritual would have unpredictable consequences. Zhao Xu, holding the sacred emblem, was confident that he could dispel the spirits. If anything abnormal occurred, he could still control the situation.

Zhao Xu was now equipped with powerful gear and had a more confident demeanor than before.

The ritual was being conducted by the tall, thin man in the middle, who began to chant an incantation, followed by the other three people, each repeating the chant. However, Zhao Xu felt that the incantation was deviating from the normal ritual.

As he noticed the abnormality, Zhao Xu began to prepare to interrupt the ritual. At the same time, he was constantly searching for knowledge and skills.

One of the most severe consequences of interrupting the ritual was to switch the allegiance of the person conducting the ritual or summon a strange creature. Zhao Xu was counting down the seconds, preparing to insert himself into the repetition of a certain incantation to stop the students' ritual. Just as he was about to speak up...

Suddenly, a gust of cold wind blew, absorbing all the heat from the surrounding air.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, the tall, thin man conducting the ceremony grabbed a powder and scattered it onto the fire pit.

Instantly, Zhao Xu's voice was about to shout "stop" but he discovered he was completely unable to make a sound.

【Adventurer Xiaoyue, you failed to dodge the effect of the "Silence" spell, and are now in a state of silence within the area】

Silence!

At this moment, the four people who were still muttering incantations halfway through were also astonished, completely unable to understand what was happening.

This effect is similar to the secondary spell "Silence" of the same name.

It not only prevents sounds within a 6.5-meter radius from being made, but also blocks any spell that contains the component of "language".

Just so, Zhao Xu had learned most of his spells, with the key component being incantations.

Even without the spellcasting stance or spellcasting materials, it would still work.

However, Zhao Xu was not flustered.

The ordinary wizards could only do one of two things: flee the area as quickly as possible or cast a very limited spell that did not require language.

But Zhao Xu was different.

His "Transmission Boots" on his feet did not require any language and could transport him out of the Silence spell's range.

At the same time, he could consume "Potential Points" to simulate the "Spellcasting Silence" ability, which would allow him to cast spells without incantations.

Subsequently, the air that had seemed to stagnate again began to flow smoothly once more.

The four people who had been unable to speak and open their mouths again effortlessly finished their incantations.

Even Zhao Xu noticed that his dynamic panel had flashed a prompt indicating the cancellation of the Silence spell.

However, he knew it was too late.

The flames dancing on top of the bonfire suddenly burst forth with a giant cloud of thick smoke, slowly taking the shape of a person.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You summon me here, what do you want?"

The voice of the misty body was very cold, and even its deep red eyes that had been projected seemed to be a cold and merciless gaze.

"We want Lisa back," the man standing in front of the bonfire said dryly, and then he showed a guilty expression.

"Ahah, indeed, foolish humans will always ask me for such foolish requests."

The misty body let out a deep, mocking laugh, "However, I'm in a good mood today, and I'll satisfy your request."

"You know the ritual, so you should know the rules."

The tall, thin man smiled and quickly nodded, "I know, it's written in the book, and I've prepared all the ritual offerings."

As he spoke, he quickly put down the book in his hand and lowered his head to pick up the bag that was placed on the ground, which contained the corpse of a goat.

"No, that's not enough. Restoring the corpse is one request, and bringing her back is another request. Don't you want your girlfriend to live with a rotten body?"

The entity attached to the misty body whispered.

It lightly pointed to the ground below, which was where Lisa was buried.

At this time, Zhao Xu also took out his staff from his hand.

He had never seen such a mysterious entity that could grant wishes in the ritual ceremony at the legendary library.

So, he had already thought of a way to resolve this matter, which was the book in the hand of the tall, thin man.

According to the legend of the "Luo Duo" in the legendary library, every book of magic that she had not collected could be exchanged for a magical item.

"What do you want? As long as I have it, I'll give it to you," the tall, thin man said anxiously.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's great, I, the great one, just need one thing," said the mysterious spirit that had transformed into a puff of smoke, suddenly bursting into a grotesque laugh. "That's your friends!"

As soon as the words were spoken, the four people who had been sitting in the corner, following the ritual, suddenly fell to the ground with a thud, already dead.

The tall and thin man immediately collapsed, crying and shouting, "No, no, I don't want that! I want them back!"

The mysterious spirit continued to laugh, saying, "Okay, why not? Who cares if I'm in a good mood today?"

Slowly, the dead bodies stood up again, but with pale faces and staring eyes straight at the tall and thin man.

In this instant, they had all been transformed into zombies.

"Don't hurry, your Lisa will come back the same way soon," the spirit continued to laugh, seemingly very pleased with the tall and thin man's expression.

"Time reversal."
Zhao Xu muttered to himself, holding the talisman in his hand.

Suddenly, all the surroundings began to rapidly reverse, and the ashes that had fallen to the ground re-ignited into their original charcoal form.

The wind that had just blown by also reversed direction.

The four zombies' faces turned red and their already murky eyes regained their vitality.

They all returned to 6 seconds earlier, returning to the state before they fell to the ground.

Zhao Xu looked at the man who had fallen to the ground, holding the talisman in his hand, and shouted at the front of the mysterious spirit, "Get out!"

Drive out the spell!
Zhao Xu looked at the direct disappearance of the mist with a blank expression, wondering how such a lowly spirit, transformed into a zombie-making garbage, dared to come here to use the prayer spell to revive the powerful.
