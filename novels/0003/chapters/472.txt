Chapter 473: Array Camp: Chaos and Benevolence

On the forum, a post about "Zhōngxià" was edited and sent out shortly after the player who was escorting Freyl went offline. The post read: "BOOM! Maybe we all underestimated the first player. You'll never guess his second identity!"

Instantly, the post was flooded with responses from numerous players, pushing down the previously popular post featuring a cute photo of a female player. The post was written from the perspective of a player who acted as a bodyguard and described in detail their group's miraculous experience of escaping from the winter wolves and white dragons after returning from the Ice Mountain range.

More importantly, this post revealed a crucial secret: the first player, "Zhōngxià", is also the chairman of the Starlight Town Mage Association.

This sudden revelation caused a massive wave in the entire forum, dominating all the hot topics of the day. As a result, the question "Who is Zhōngxià?" sparked a flood of responses and attention.

The name "Zhōngxià" had become a hot topic in recent times. Indeed, there were players who, within a few months, had risen from being ordinary waiters to holding official positions, such as town administrators. However, no one expected that the chairman of the Starlight Town Mage Association, a position with immense power and influence, would be granted to another player.
Here is the translation of the text:

Especially, the one awarded as the "Pitfall Town" player's first main town-level influence is a "Star Lord".
Combining the two is even more powerful.

However, there are already rebuttals appearing on the forum.

【Are you kidding? I'm in Pitfall Town, can you point out which building is the "Mages' Association" on the map? Is this just a joke?】
【Just kidding, unfortunately, I met a local player and was soon exposed.】
【Trouble upstairs, those who rebutted, please take a good look at the post, this "Xiaohua" is actually preparing to establish one, what's the point of him coming to prepare?】
【So it's even more ridiculous, do you think a player can build a complete Mages' Association from scratch? You don't have enough research and social resources to build a high-rise tower, let alone a grand association.】
At that time, because the original post was so confident, the doubting posts about Xiaohua's role as the head of the Mages' Association did not go unnoticed.

However, the posts doubting the opponent's preparations for the Mages' Association did increase, especially among the players in the entire Winter City and Pitfall Town.
Meanwhile, Zhao Xue's classmates from the same university were discussing this topic in their class and college groups, and the previously mysterious number one player was about to "drop in" Pitfall Town.
"This Xiaohua brother is so cool!" Zhang Qi praised him in the group chat, as if he had a natural affinity for the high-level player of the same gender.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ha ha, you're already licking it up without even seeing it? Don't go and slap your hot face onto someone else's cold buttocks."

Elite student Li Tian Ge saw this and couldn't help but mock him.

Zhang Qi naturally wouldn't let it slide and immediately counter-mocked, "Li Tian Ge, I never thought you would be as small-minded as to think that way."

"Who's small-minded, I don't know."

"There's no need to argue about this. We'll naturally get to see the strength of this big shot player in action. Especially since the new batch of novice mages has arrived in Starfall Town, we'll get to see it soon."

The two of them had been arguing online for a while, and it was really annoying.

"Hey, don't you remember when the guardian of our town encountered someone claiming to be the president of the Mage Association a while back? Since our town doesn't have a Mage Association, the guardian treated them like scammers."

A classmate suddenly thought back to that time.

"That's right. The first time I saw that person use a force field weapon that could cause harm, and later, a team of cavalry was summoned from the mine guardian's power, but it still ended in failure. However, the participants all kept quiet about it and didn't want to talk about it."

"That's definite," class president Fang Xi Yue also chimed in. "I just heard from someone that those cavalrymen were all controlled by the 'Mass Control Spell' in that very moment, completely due to encountering an extremely powerful being."

"I'm telling you, that person claiming to be the president was clearly using the power of his artifact," Du Nan exclaimed.

"Maybe it's the power of his artifact," someone said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's roommate, Chen Sīnán, who had been quiet until then, couldn't help but say, "According to the post's author, the person who is supposed to arrive in 'Arul City' today might actually be there, and we can see the recent turmoil in Arul City by paying attention to it. Recently, whenever he appears, it's always a big commotion."

"Hey, that's Arul City, and even if this person is a 7th-level mage, throwing him into the city would only make him sink like a rock, and as for the divine artifact, it's hard to say if he can even hold onto it," Li Tiān Gē retorted.

"Hey, you're using the wrong word, Zhang Qi. What's 'defeated'? The player was a bit unclear about it at the time, but he's definitely sure there's no battle record. So it's just a bunch of empty words, where's the 'defeat' so exaggerated?" Li Tiān Gē found the ambiguous point in the post and ridiculed him on the spot.

"Hmph, you don't understand how powerful their mages are, I don't feel like explaining it to you," Zhang Qi declared.

"Heh, if that person is really that powerful, Arul City would have a big storm tonight, and some big shots would die," Li Tiān Gē continued to add fuel to the fire.

At this point, Zhang Qi was about to respond with a bet, but he didn't dare to be so certain about it, thought for a moment, and then didn't respond.

The good-for-nothing people in the class also forwarded the screenshot of the chat to other groups.

These chat logs, involving a secret news at the time, and with a bit of ridicule, were soon spread to more QQ groups, and even appeared on the forum later.

Most players who saw the post reacted with skepticism, naturally. For them, tonight was just another peaceful night in Arul City.
As the two statues of demons soared into the air, their body shapes began to gradually change, and then suddenly transformed into terrifying giant entities in Freya's unbelievable gaze. It was as if a small sailboat just a moment ago had turned into a massive ship.

As the two statues crashed to the ground, the air was filled with two massive and muffled sounds, causing the eardrums to vibrate. The ground beneath the statues' feet was so heavily loaded that it cracked and subsided, creating a layer of fissures that spread like a spider's web, causing nearby buildings to sway.

Freya felt a slight tremor and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Is this a statue? One that has been transformed?"

She had touched such statues before, even had one on her own body. But how could these statues be related to the ones she had seen in the wizarding community in Orcus City? The only similarity was the radiant glow of the metal, which she vaguely recognized under the streetlights, but was still unsure.

If these metals were real, the value of the two statues would be worth a city. At this moment, after feeling the strange vibration and tremor, it was not just the fiery red lips of the guardian who came out to investigate. The windows of the entire street, which were originally closed, suddenly lit up and opened, revealing people peeking out to see what was happening.

"Is it an earthquake?"
"No, it's just a loud noise?"
"Can't be the wizarding community conducting experiments again?"
"Ah, don't scare me like that, I have to escape the city." Instantly, many neighbors began to chatter and gossip with each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hurry up! What is that giant black shadow lurking in the shadows near the lips of the infernal flame?"

"Oh my god, a construct being, a demon?! It's just too big, this is definitely a super giant!"

"Oh no, Aurora, who knows if we'll turn color tonight!"

Several good people continued to chat leisurely by the open window. Meanwhile, the street patrol team received this disturbance and immediately blew their whistles, rushing towards this direction with all their might.

"You hide yourself, okay?" Zhao Xuan glanced back at Fleure and smiled slightly.

At this moment, her eyes were still red, and her heavy thoughts had not yet subsided, but she was shocked by Zhao Xuan's sudden surprise.

"This is the divine artifact?" She muttered to herself, her gaze towards Zhao Xuan filled with emotion and confusion.

Zhao Xuan smiled lightly, "No, but it's theoretically stronger than most divine artifacts."

At this time, he slowly walked out of the shadowy area and walked towards the mansion where the infernal flame was already making a commotion, causing many customers to rush out without even putting on their pants.

In this instant, countless people saw the two gigantic and terrifying demon statues, their every move able to crush ordinary humans like ants.

Zhao Xuan lightly raised his scepter, about to issue an order to the demon statues.

【Warning: Adventurer, your current behavior may lead you to join the "Chaos Camp"!】
Zhao Xuan glanced at the warning and just smiled carelessly.

If the laws of order cannot purify this evil, then it's up to the "Chaos" faction to use their fists to tell the world the most basic "morality".
"Wipe out everything in sight." Zhao Xu's icy tone issued this order!
