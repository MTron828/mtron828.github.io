Chapter 623: Mr. Zhongxia

After Zhao Xu's departure, the originally calm and composed Old Man Weng did not seem to be himself. His face suddenly turned stiff, as if his muscles had been controlled by another force.

Slowly, his eyes became sharper, and his mouth curled up slightly. "Do you think giving him this thing will allow you to continue suppressing me?"

At this moment, he seemed to be changing his facial muscles, sometimes looking like an old man with wrinkles and sometimes smooth and unblemished.

He continued to mutter to himself, "We all know that the gods brought humanity to this forgotten land, with one goal being the 'Paradise of Humanity'. Since that's the case, I'll give it to the one who is destined to receive it, and let them decide whether to open the dice cup and see the final result."

"Ah, old man, he's questioning Anzhiya about her parents, doesn't he know that we're not Anzhiya's biological fathers?" Old Man Weng shook his head and disagreed with his own words, saying, "No, we are. She will also acknowledge this point."

"Why do you think you're being suppressed the most?"

"It's because you've always refused to accept this history and have been carrying the 'honor' of being the earliest generation of magicians since ancient times, thinking you're a powerful figure who can trace back to Ernest's shadow and shouldn't be hiding like a mouse in a sewer, afraid to show your head."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he spoke, Wú Luò's expression turned contemptuous, "How could you not think about it? The father of that little girl can merge us into his body, using all our abilities for him. At that moment, our defeat was already determined. From then on, our consciousness became part of him."

"If Ernest hadn't sealed off his consciousness and abandoned this region using the Magic King's trap, we wouldn't have had a chance to wake up," the old man Wú Luò said dejectedly.

He then revealed a disappointed expression, "And I'm to blame. My identity as a mage is too well-suited to his nature. Every time I wake up, his subconscious also automatically manifests, causing the spatial cutting force around us to continue activating."

"What were you just trying to kill him?" someone asked.

"Haha, old fellow, I'm not like you and Bai He. A dual genius, mage, scholar of the ancient tomes, and owner of the hidden potential point - it's a perfect new vessel for our bodies," Wú Luò said confidently.

"He can secretly detach a thread and attach it to the man in front of him. Can you bear the consequences?" someone asked.

"No, this person is not the same," Wú Luò said, revealing a confident expression. "You think I suddenly interrupted you and forcibly took control of your consciousness? It's because he just uttered the 'iron heart' secret mantra."

"This means he has received the recognition of the ultimate scroll. You're clearer than me on this. This means that if the tides of history remain unchanged, he may very well be the fourth-generation Magic Sovereign. And although I don't want to admit it, this kid indeed possesses the Nine Swords innate talent."

"Ah, forget it, let's just take it slow. This damned slave-owning profession!" the middle-aged Wú Luò continued to curse.

Note: Wú Luò is the protagonist of the story, and Bai He is another character. The text is a conversation between them, discussing their situation and the consequences of their actions.
Here is the translation of the text:

Compared to the initial thrill of stepping into the unknown, the old man, without intending to, allowed Zhao Xu to gradually lose the pressure of the "anti-demon field" and directly exit the sealed land.

On the other hand, he was constantly swinging his heavy sword, trying to recreate the feeling of successfully intercepting the opponent's attack.

However, that feeling of wielding a weapon from the heart was about to fade away, and he couldn't grasp it.

After witnessing the "history" just now and combining it with his knowledge, Zhao Xu had begun to understand why he had evolved to this outcome after entering the underground.

The dragon crystals he held were the source of power for the demon king device.

Therefore, if these dragon crystals wandered outside the mineral vein, they would attract the demon king device, triggering the summoning of countless undead creatures to surround him.

Although Zhao Xu was alone, he was no longer as desperate as he was in the anti-demon field.

As for the deep wound on his foot, he directly used a recovery spell to heal it.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was almost unmatched in terms of self-sufficiency and self-recovery, unlike other players who had entered the cave and were desperate.

The "Battle Sword" (Military Way) could only master three sets of techniques and one stance, just enough to prepare for three moves. He was like a "wizard" who had mastered three spells and could switch between them at any time. The stance was a kind of "passive skill".

As for the "Iron Heart Force", he would naturally need to master another "Iron Heart Flow" martial art first, so he had already secured two slots.

Initially, he had used the "Sword-Edge Barrier" to no avail, and Zhao Xu had quietly turned to other directions.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

He wandered aimlessly in the underground tunnel, swinging his sword and preparing to practice various techniques, hoping to get lucky and see which Iron Heart Wu Xing technique he could master.

The first level of Iron Heart Wu Xing includes the techniques "Posture of Punishment", "Steel Wind", and "Steel Strike". The first technique allows for a 1-6 damage reduction when maintaining a defensive posture. The second technique allows for a perfect arc attack on two targets at once. The third technique sacrifices personal defense to deal 4-grade attack power.

The second level includes the techniques "Sword Shield" and "Disarming Attack", with the latter allowing the user to disarm an enemy after a successful attack.

The third level includes the techniques "Mobile Fortress" (increases defense by 2 grades), "Vajra Repels Evil" (breaks an enemy's weapon and weakens 4 points of damage), and the most critical "Iron Heart Power".

In general, the third level has preconditions, so Zhao Xu has a limited range of options, only choosing from the first two levels.

At this point, Zhao Xu was troubled by his upcoming decision.

For him, it had been too long since he had to make such a careful choice.

Except for the initial selection of the first technique, he had always learned everything at once and followed a comprehensive approach.

He walked quietly with the heavy sword in his hand, taking one step at a time.

After touching the Unbeatable, his Dragon Crystal aura had been washed away. As long as he didn't use it again, he wouldn't have to worry about triggering another wave of undead creatures.

As Zhao Xu observed, he also noticed a small entrance with faint light in front of him, and surprisingly, there were many people inside.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Mystical energy circulation, magical power flowing. The 'Sharp Ear Technique' instantly locates itself inside, allowing it to finely listen to the details within the cave.

"Ah, Sister, I'm really craving ice cream right now."

"Don't even think about eating it, you'll die. You came in here so recklessly, and now the whole family has followed. If anything happens to us, who will take care of our parents?"

"Don't you know how harsh the current situation is?"

"This isn't a joke, it's a matter of life and death. The reward is so high, and I don't know if you also secretly accepted the task and came in here."

At this point, outside of the exchange between the siblings, another deep voice was heard, saying, "Don't blame your brother for this. Nobody expected it to be this treacherous in this cave. Even experienced people like Tiger of the Bramble Fortress and the Dual Assassins of Sunset Mountain Valley were defeated by these undead creatures within minutes."

"That's just it, we're helpless in this situation. Let's just defend ourselves and wait for someone to come and rescue us."

But the woman sighed bitterly, "We're not the kind of people who are used to being rescued. Those people who come to rescue us are different from us. We've only been stuck here for a day or two, and yet there are already people coming to help. This shows that they've realized the gravity of the situation, but they're still unable to alleviate the situation. This means they're completely powerless in this matter."

"You should know that the ones who can come down here are all exceptional in the game world, except for other forces intervening. Otherwise, who can save us?"

"Sister, Summer, the first in the rankings, isn't it possible for her to come down as well?"
Here is the translation:

"Idiot, did you pretend not to know when you registered for an account without using your brain? How could you be so stupid? Even a beggar wouldn't dare to venture into such a desolate place.

At this moment, many forces that have entered the wilderness have retained the title of "Lord" that they had in Starfall Town, which has made even the most unruly players start to accept this name.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xiu, who had just stepped out the door, scratched his head silently.

He really did come down.

It's awkward, but he's also been trapped like them.

However, it seems that these people are probably just arriving here, otherwise, the two sentries outside wouldn't be stationed there.

Zhao Xiu silently took a step forward, causing a faint sound to echo through the cave. Suddenly, the cries of over ten people hiding in the cave went up.

"Who?"

He then walked in silently.

The few adventurers looked at Zhao Xiu's cloak-clad attire and smiled in surprise.

If they are really trapped underground forever, as long as there is a priest who can persistently produce food every day, they can survive.

But it was only when they saw Zhao Xiu holding the "Heavy Sword" that the group's faces turned pale.

Priests are not skilled in heavy swords, unless they choose a "War" domain, which allows them to specialize in the weapons favored by their deity.

This probability is extremely low.

Just then, everyone's mouths were unable to close, and they opened them slightly.

Because the ten people in the cave, illuminated by dim light, saw Zhao Xiu's head adorned with a "Ayn Stone" that looked like a small star system, spinning constantly.

The Ayn Stone used its unique charm to convey to everyone present that they are not ordinary.

'Lord Zhang!'"

A joyful cry echoed from within."
