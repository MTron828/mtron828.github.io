Chapter 465: Dragon's Breath

Zhao Xun quickly nodded in agreement, but White Dragon Serus felt as if he had just pawned his future away for no reason.

Just thinking of the ancient dragon outside, Serus felt hesitant to retract his words.

But he still refused to give up, saying, "You guys should know that the dragons outside are ruthless and won't distinguish between us and them once they arrive."

For the evil colored dragons, a single spew of venom could kill everything in sight, and they wouldn't bother with petty concerns like relationships.

Just as ordinary people wouldn't care about ants when they're trying to kill cockroaches.

As Freyr listened to this, he felt like he was witnessing his own death, his entire body frozen stiff like ice, unable to move a muscle.

But the Summer Mage before him was saying that he would be a powerful ally in the future, and he might even rely on him to stir up the situation in Orlu City.

Although he wanted to persuade the other party to give up on this bodyguard who had summoned the dragons, he couldn't bring himself to speak up.

In fact, he even suspected that the other party might have just summoned new allies after driving away the dragon.

Freyr even looked at the bodyguard who the Summer Mage called "owing a debt" with suspicion, wondering if the young mother dragon had changed her taste in men to prefer strong and muscular men like this.

He was fascinated by the young human men who were strong and muscular.
Zhao Xu looked at Bai Long Seliu, who had agreed, and immediately assumed a regretful expression, saying directly, "We will not involve others and will withdraw on our own. At that time——"

At this moment, An Ni Yao interrupted, saying, "You can bet on it."

"Let's see if my 'Dragon Tribe Ignoring Technique' works," she said, looking down at Bai Long Seliu with a condescending glance.

Upon hearing these words, Bai Long Seliu suddenly felt like it had stumbled upon a treasure team.

The legendary "Dragon Tribe Ignoring Technique" had a bit of an impression on him, as the small dragon mother had once told him that it was a technique that could suppress the giant dragon clan's seven-ring art.

If this technique had not been passed down, the dragon tribe's treasure trove would not have been able to withstand the group of wizards' plunder.

The wizards would burn the dragon scales and apply the "Dragon Tribe Ignoring Technique" to themselves, causing a thick fog to rise around their bodies, which would then be absorbed by their skin.

This technique was similar to the "Soul Ignoring Technique" and "Animal Ignoring Technique", and was even more tyrannical.

Even the most starving evil red dragon would ignore the presence of the caster, no matter how keen the dragon tribe's eyesight or how skilled they were at using their senses. The technique also had no resistance to any kind of counterattack, and because it was a defensive technique, it would not be affected by spells like "True Knowledge" or "Psychic Shield". It was at the level of a "rule".

As long as the caster did not deliberately attack the giant dragon, this technique would be able to protect the caster until the spell wore off. Even if it encountered a legendary giant dragon, it would not be afraid.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can only whisper to a few people, saying, 'When the colossal dragon has reached its gigantic size, a conical-shaped projectile shoots out, with a radius and height of over 20 meters, and even a cat can catch a mouse on a good day.'"

Anzino laughed mockingly and said, "The 'Suppressive Projection' of the Three Rings, I haven't tried it out much yet, so I'll try it when the time comes. Or maybe I'll develop an immunity to cold energy damage. Is it that difficult? It's just a level 7 energy immune spell."

As soon as she finished speaking, even the usually proud White Dragon Selerus was speechless.

What she said was true, but few mages could successfully cast this spell to suppress the dragons' projectiles.

However, considering that this was said by this terrifying female mage, Selerus didn't dare to doubt it.

At this moment, the exterior dragons outside the carriage seemed to be unable to understand the delay inside, and continued to roar and urge on.

In an instant, a wild and ferocious roar from outside echoed through the air, causing the eardrums of the people inside to vibrate violently.

"The enemy is about to dive-bomb us," Selerus said, "and it's going to use its 'Fierce Dragon's Fury'!"

As he spoke, he looked proudly at the others, unless their life force was higher than that of the dragon, in which case they would have to withstand this supernatural ability.

Unfortunately, dragons of the same kind were immune to this ability, so it wouldn't work on them.

In the past, when Zhao Xu and Maple Leaf Team were passing through a gorge, the golden dragon Campanus had flown across the top of their carriage, using this ability to suppress everyone, putting them all into a state of "terror" and "shivering" with fear.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I have the courage of the divine," Saint Warrior Vivianne exclaimed, her 3rd-level Saint Warrior ability not only allowing her to be immune to fear, but also to help her allies resist such a negative state, providing a 4th-level boost to their willpower.

As Vivianne spoke, the light of courage seemed to slowly seep into the hearts of those around her, causing Frey's face to redden slightly and his spirits to lift.

"Roar of the Lion," Zhào Xù immediately cast the 1st-level Saint Warrior spell on himself.

To him, even the strongest immunity was no match for the immunity provided by Vivianne's ability.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, your "Roar of the Lion" spell takes effect. You are immune to fear, lasting for 23 turns.】

As for Anzhi, she didn't need Zhào Xù to worry about her immunity to fear, as it was something she could easily solve with her daily buff spells.

Suddenly, the sound of wings flapping and the roar of a dragon echoed through the air, even louder than the howling wind outside.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you are immune to fear and ignore the dragon's "Fierce Aura" ability.】

Following this, the sound of a dragon swooping down echoed through the air, with multiple dragons attacking simultaneously.

Zhào Xù noticed that Frey's face had turned pale, as if recalling a terrifying experience from the past. His face had turned purple and cold sweat was dripping down his face.

As long as he could withstand the dragon's ability once, he would be immune to it for 24 hours.

Frey, being able to bear the weight of his responsibilities in Auroria, could work together with Vivianne's courage to resist the dragon's attack, unless the ancient dragon personally intervened. However, with multiple white dragons swooping down, leaving no opening for them to counterattack.

Even Zhào Xù wasn't reacting quickly enough, and if he didn't cast an immunity spell beforehand, he would be affected by the repeated attacks of multiple dragons.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's go out," said Zhao Xu as he pulled back the curtain of the carriage.

Inside the carriage, Farel's lips were trembling, and he had lost all fighting spirit. This was exactly what he wanted, as some things were not suitable for outsiders to hear.

When Zhao Xu and his group got off the carriage, they found that the surrounding guards were lying on the ground, looking lazy and disheveled. Even those who still had consciousness had a blank expression and a pale face. It was clear that they had been defeated by the dragon's powerful attack. This was the typical behavior of the "Dragon" clan, which was weak in its juvenile stage but became formidable once it reached the fifth stage and gained the "fierce" ability. Under the influence of the "aura" that could affect a range of over 10 meters, the number of people was no longer an advantage. This was also the reason why the black dragon from the previous era was able to defeat the Star City.

Arthur, with his numerous abilities, could erase the numerical advantage. Therefore, "strong adventurers" were the dream of many forces.

One strong adventurer could equip a team of hundreds or thousands of soldiers, and it was not just empty talk. Even Zhao Xu, who was determined to help the white dragon Serus, could only stand blankly in the snow, watching the snowstorm in the vast expanse of white snow. Most of the dragons had lost their pure white scales, which had turned gray-blue and light gray, with white scales mixed in. Compared to other colorful dragons, these dragons were smaller in scale and had a more robust and powerful body.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Especially when a large number of giant dragons appear at the same time, it looks like ten or more enormous ice sculptures standing in front of you, and even the visual effect is enough to make your heart palpitate.

Even Anzennia, who was standing beside him, felt a bit of goosebumps.

"You've caused so many mother dragons to be killed, and now people are coming to hunt you down?" Zhao Xuan couldn't help but complain.

Giant dragons have a natural tendency to be cold-blooded and greedy for treasure. Even if they form a marriage with another giant dragon, it's rare for it to last long. Many times, they will separate as they age, with the exception of bringing one or two young dragons along.

Therefore, this scene of ten or more giant dragons has happened to him several times on the battlefield of the seal war. It's impossible to imagine in everyday life.

Is this just a debt of one or two mother dragons? Are you, Serus, really responsible for the destruction of the entire ice mountain range of the young and middle-aged white dragons?

"I'm a dragon like that?" Serus was infuriated. "And besides, our white dragons are open-minded. Where is there no destruction or chaos?"

"Serus, you, a greedy reptile, finally dare to come out from that carriage?""

The elder, a true ancient white dragon, had a body covered in grayish-white scales, with thick limbs sprawled on the snow, and a long tail swishing back and forth, looking like a layer of white towers stacked up.

"'When you were young..."

Suddenly, its murky yellow eyes stared straight at Zhao Xuan, and it let out a thunderous roar.

"The breath of the dragon's pearl?"
