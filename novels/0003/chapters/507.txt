Chapter 508: The Truth About Wang Ningwei

**Personnel List:**

* 8th Grade: 1 person ("Summer" - a level 8 mage)
* 7th Grade: 0 people (no information)
* 6th Grade: 0 people (no information)

Note: This time, we will be skipping two levels and displaying the player's name.

The official account "Creation Temple" on the forum, on behalf of the official planning team of King Arthur, has refreshed the "Jumping Space" clause once again without mercy.

Players have begun to feel numb and mechanically reopen this post.

In fact, they don't even need to guess - they know that players have once again been left behind by a powerful figure.

As the core players of Aurora City have revealed, the forum has basically confirmed one fact.

That is, the player "Summer" has indeed completed an unprecedented achievement as a player - serving as the chairman of the Association of Local Magicians.

As the chairman, this player has held a key position in the Arthurian Empire and has been in office.

Needless to say, the number of wizard apprentices in the player group is not small, and those who have been playing since the game's first day have been waiting for this moment.

They can intuitively sense the magnitude of the "Chairman of the Association of Local Magicians" position.

The player who holds this position has already been able to mobilize a powerful team of players and even make a profit by taking advantage of the situation.

Numerous sponsors who wanted to give money to King Arthur's team have been trying to find this "Summer" gentleman and negotiate some kind of "benefit exchange" with him.

Especially after the news spreads that the player "Summer" has taken over the management of "Falling Star Town" after rescuing the leader of the alliance's wife and children, this trend will become even stronger.

It was unexpected for anyone to hear the name of Zhong Xia again, and to their surprise, he had leveled up to level 8 without anyone noticing. After Zhao Xu finished playing the game, he went to the bathroom to relieve himself in the middle of the night. When he came out, he found his childhood friend Nan Xiaoyu standing by the wall, looking at him with a trembling gaze.

"What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked, wiping his hands with a paper towel.

"You've leveled up again?" Nan Xiaoyu asked curiously.

"No, Nan Xiaoyu, you've been busy studying lately. How do you know about the game?" Zhao Xu asked back.

Nan Xiaoyu had been taking care of her father in the hospital, and after he was discharged, she naturally went back home and didn't need to stay at Zhao Xu's place anymore.

"I didn't play the game," Nan Xiaoyu said, holding up her phone to show Zhao Xu the chat records of their class group.

"Exploded, exploded," a cute girl with a profile picture spoke up.

"If Zhong Xia is my boyfriend, can't I just play as I like?" a girl's voice said.

"And you can even let us all level up together," another girl added.

"Save the children, that big shot has revealed the secret to leveling up," someone else chimed in.

"Isn't that what they're saying on the forum?" Zhao Xu asked, scanning the chat records with a puzzled expression.

If people were blowing things up on the forum, it was understandable, but even in a class chat group, where everyone was friends and played the game together, this was too exaggerated.

"Is this what high school girls are into these days?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.
Here is the translation of the text:

He's only been out of college for a few years, he can't be this exaggerated, right? "What are you thinking?" South Wei said with a smile, "The main thing is, the scope of your exaggeration is too large, and before that, you only jumped a level." "This time, you actually succeeded in jumping two levels again, and even those who didn't want to give up were defeated by you." "Xu Ge, the ones on the forum are even more exaggerated. We're already considered rational people." South Wei said with pride.

"People are small, but the devil is big."

Just after receiving a bunch of equipment, Zhao Xu was also in a good mood, and after a sentence of criticism, he directly went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of Xing Ji, opened it and took a sip.

For some reason, he felt that his energy consumption was too high recently, and at night, he would sneak to the kitchen to supplement some food.

Unbeknownst to Zhao Xu, South Wei was not following him to the bathroom, but had been following him since he got out of the room.

"You want to drink it yourself," Zhao Xu said to South Wei, who was looking at him with a pleading expression, and also chewed on the bread that his mom had bought that day, which was a bit hard.

"No," South Wei shook his head, "Xu Ge, don't you know what's going on upstairs?"

Zhao Xu laughed, "What else can I do? These things can't be eaten as a meal."

"If I'm that famous, I'll definitely read all the posts about me on the forum."

"However, Xu Ge, how can you maintain this advantage, and you're still an upgrading slow wizard?"

Zhao Xu had already drunk half a bottle of Xing Ji.

"Wait until everyone slowly gets to the secret, and my speed will definitely be overtaken, so this doesn't matter."

He's not going to open his mouth and complain that you players are too weak.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, Xiao Guo, how did you manage to slaughter hundreds of adventurers who had malice towards you, and then come out of the Aizhou Palace in the dark forest? They are a four-person team, and they're hard to beat. As for a team of hundreds of people, you can wipe out the entire school's players in one second, leaving some time to spare.

"'Professionally strong, progressed strong, magical strong, equipped strong,' you summarized. 'If you can achieve these, you'll be just like me.'

"'For example?' Little Nan asked curiously.

"She didn't expect Zhao Xu to reveal their differences for the first time in the early hours of the morning.

"'For example?' Zhao Xu asked back.

"Little Nan thought for a moment, then said, 'Two.'

"'And I have more than 10 specialties,' Zhao Xu said.

"Looking at Little Nan's widening mouth, even an egg could fit in.

"He continued to reveal more, 'Or, how many magical equipment do you have?'

"This time, Little Nan didn't count on her fingers, but instead answered directly, 'Zero.'

"'And I have more than 20,' Zhao Xu said.

"'Ah,' Little Nan exclaimed, on the verge of jumping up, 'You're just making it up! You're completely a player tycoon!'

"'I know, so you go to sleep early,' Zhao Xu tapped Little Nan's forehead and then left by himself.

"At this time, he noticed that his QQ group had a message from Wang Qingwei.

"A string of messages, he hadn't had a chance to respond to them in the past few days.

"'Hey, Xia Xia, this time I've been assigned to be the vice-chairman of the Starfall Town, so we'll be partners in the future,'"

"'Oh, Xia Xia, how did you break through level 8, I'm still struggling to reach level 5,'"
Here is the translation of the given text:

"I'm almost there, sitting on the carriage," someone said.

However, I recently met a pastor named Yin'er on the road, and she's a great person, but I feel that her faith is not like any ordinary deity, it's very mysterious.

To be honest, I was still reading Wang Qingwei's reply to Zhao Xu, and suddenly I couldn't help but take a deep breath.

Wang Qingwei, Zheng Xin'an?

Is it too coincidental for the two of them to meet like this?

Although they are leaving Mistral together, they still have some connection, but it's too convenient to travel together.

"However, I heard that the waves in Auror City are quite big," Wang Qingwei said at the end, which is exactly what she said ten minutes ago.

"It's good that we've made it through," Zhao Xu replied immediately.

Keling: Hehe, I finally see you.

Zhongxia: Every day, hanging out in the game, the reality is naturally influenced.

Keling: But, Mr. Zhongxia, you're not the kind of person who is addicted to games.

Zhongxia: Then, Keling, you're not?

Keling: Hehe, I used to think I wasn't.

Zhongxia: However, I hope we can work together happily.

Keling: Received, old big brother.

Zhongxia: ...

Keling: However, Zhongxia, I have a guess about this world, do you want to hear it?

Zhao Xu's face, which was still smiling, suddenly stopped when he saw these words.

He tapped on the keyboard, having just input a line, and then deleted it.

Finally, the text left was only one word - "Yes".

"That's Zhongxia, can you take out your phone and call me at 13829xxxxxx? Please forgive me, I can only say this to you through the phone."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, with some dialogue and narration. The story seems to be a fantasy or sci-fi story, with elements of mystery and adventure.
Here is the translation:

As soon as Zhao Xu picked up his phone, he pressed the numbers lightly.

Outside, the night was dark, and the air was a bit chilly, with heavy dew.

Zhao Xu was alone in his bed, wrapped in a blanket, with the phone's light illuminating his face, listening to the late-night phone call from another woman in the world.
