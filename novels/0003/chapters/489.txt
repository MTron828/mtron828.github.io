Chapter 490: The Disappearance of the Summer Solstice
"It's all Ernest's fault. He's doing it on purpose!"
"He wouldn't dare to tell a lie, deceive the world's living beings, but that doesn't mean he'll explain himself after seeing others misunderstand!"
At that moment, Lord Gralt, his face clouded with anger, spoke with a sense of hatred.

The air around him was filled with the acrid smell of burned soil, making his stomach turn with disgust.

The prophecy that had been fulfilled, which had once been able to reveal the depth of the "Lord", was torn open once again.

The ancient, evil demon lords, who possessed a nature of "ambition", had their flames of ambition burning fiercely, no matter how small. Who could predict the outcome? The master of the abyss, who was not among them, was none other than...

The abyss, one of the 17 planes, held crucial importance and was ranked among the top few. Its full name, "Infinite Plane of the Bottomless Abyss", revealed the essence of this plane, which was said to be a gathering place for all sorts of ugliness, chaos, and evil.

Each layer of the abyss spiraled downward, leading to a realm filled with cruelty and evil. According to legend, the abyss had 666 layers, but most records guessed that the actual number was much higher.

Even the leaders of the abyss and evil deities only occupied one layer, which led to the conclusion that the number of abyss lords was considerable.

As for Gralt, who had once ruled the abyss, he was akin to one of the three great evil demon lords, renowned for his mighty reputation.

However, the abyss, a realm of chaos, could potentially bring about the "integration of unity" and order, but such an event would be short-lived. Nevertheless, achieving such a feat would be an extraordinary accomplishment.

As can be seen, the initial overlord, Glazet, had invested immense mental and physical effort to achieve a state of balance, only to have it all destroyed by a mistaken prophecy.

It's no wonder that Glazet would bring up the name Ernest whenever he mentions it, his heart filled with anger.

"Just go find the original Ernest and ask him to find me a normal circle mage, and get a promise from him that would be useless," he said.

Zhao Xu continued, "I've also asked Master Anzhiya, and she confirmed that I am not the reincarnation of King Ernest, so you can't find me and seek revenge."

"Ha! If you are the reincarnation of Ernest, then even if it leads to the descent of divine beings, I will still make my true form appear in Arthur, and then imprison you for eternity," Glazet said.

"But I need your promise because of the fate line on your body."

"I've consumed most of my 'fate energy', which I obtained by risking my life when Yege was on the brink of death. I used some of it because of the divine reason, and it will make me weaker," he said.

"However, it's worth it. I used these energies to discover your characteristic as a 'breaker of fate'."

As Glazet spoke, he let out a sly smile, "Don't look at Anzhiya, who is currently being very kind and obedient to you, as she is also looking at your characteristic of breaking free from the constraints of fate. Perhaps she is even dreaming of bringing Ernest back."

"Of course, she will rely on you, and may even ask you to sacrifice yourself for this in the future. Because, according to Arthur's current fate line, no matter what path is taken, there is no possibility of Ernest's return," Glazet said, finally seeming satisfied.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Why?" Zhong Xia listened to the other person's words, but the words that had pierced his heart didn't interest him at all.

However, the possibility that followed left him utterly perplexed.

"It's very simple."

"If Ernest still has the possibility of returning."

Grazzt sighed, "Then, at present, you see Anniya."

"She will still be the master of the material world of Arthur."

"Even if Ernest leaves Arthur, he will be unable to return. This is certified by himself. Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to use the 'secret' as bait, pretending to request the gods' protection for Anniya's sake."

"In reality, it was the 'secret's' allure that sparked a new war among the gods."

As Grazzt said this, he also revealed a hint of longing in his eyes, "At that time, when I was still weak, I witnessed for the first time the precarious situation where Arthur was on the verge of being shattered."

Zhao Xu slightly leaned to one side, still maintaining the same posture as before Anniya left, refusing to look back.

"I, even as a breaker of seals, am powerless to make a promise."

In the past, the magic goddess Sylvia had never made a promise to him before their meeting in the river of history, before her ascension to godhood.

Later, she was given the identity of a priest and was rescued from Grazzt's hands in the Sacred Heart Cathedral, with no unusual events occurring throughout the process.

As such, he had never made a promise.

The only exception was when he made a vow to "defend magic to the death" under the inducement of the stone tablet at the age of 77, in order to simultaneously level up his dual profession.

"What's wrong?"

(Note: I've kept the translation as precise and concise as possible, without adding any unnecessary words or phrases.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Glazet looked at Zhao Xu, who had fallen silent, as if displeased. "I've already told you the ancient history," he said. "Don't you think it's time you showed me some sincerity too?"

"One promise won't affect your future commitments," Glazet replied.

"I also make a promise with equal power," Glazet continued. "I will help you obtain the divine power of the deep abyss. This will allow you to become the 'lord' of one of the layers in the bottomless abyss."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's eyes suddenly flashed with multiple water-like, pale, and translucent ripples of light, and various scenes began to refract inside.

Zhao Xu was sitting in a luxurious palace, surrounded by dozens of beautiful female servants, each wearing lightweight silk and dancing enticingly before him. The alluring posture also revealed the true nature of the succubus. Below, thousands of powerful demons, including the legendary "Barlo Flame Demon", were kneeling, swearing loyalty to him.

Zhao Xu was also standing on a battlefield, holding up his staff, and suddenly, a "Mysterious Storm" swept across the sky, crushing countless demons and leaving their bodies scattered everywhere.

Zhao Xu was also walking on the surface of the earth, followed by a group of heavily armored knights, with a princess in front of him, blowing him a kiss and congratulating his return.

Zhao Xu was also standing on a floating city, with Anniya standing in the distance, gazing at him with a look of reverence and admiration, her emotions impossible to put into words, while the surrounding wizards, with looks of shock and amazement, bowed down in respect.

Ten different paths of life unfolded before Zhao Xu's eyes.

"Stop it," Zhao Xu couldn't help but scold Glazet.
Here is the translation of the text:

The things that came before were just exaggerations. The ones that followed were too ridiculous, even for a hero's epic novel like King Arthur's. "What's the point of all this? These things you see before you are nothing compared to what Ernest Hemingway wrote," Glazet retorted.

"So, you refuse to make a promise to me? Are you prepared to face the wrath of the mighty Glazet alone?" he asked, facing the question.

Zhao Xu also realized that the time for storytelling had finally come to an end.

Glazet, who had been patiently persuading him earlier, had exhausted his "patience" and was now expecting a return.

"Where did you take my mentor?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

In reality, Glazet had been thinking about why Anzhenya suddenly disappeared from the moment he started telling the story.

With Anzhenya's abilities, she had to be careful not to provoke the ruler of the underworld, Asmorth, who was known for his cunning. Other deep-sea leaders were just a joke.

As long as one lived in the underworld, one could rely on the will of the deep sea to intimidate others.

In reality, Anzhenya had really lost her footing.

If Anzhenya was really okay, she should have come looking for herself by now.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's entire body was as if he had been struck by a huge impact, and he stood still, frozen.

In his mind, countless questions swirled around, and the moment of revelation had arrived, explaining everything that had happened before.

He suddenly turned around.

The next moment, Zhao Xu also disappeared.
