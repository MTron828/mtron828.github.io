Chapter 139: Fear

The creepy laughter was accompanied by the sound of fingernails scratching on the blackboard, a shrill and low-pitched noise that seemed to want to tear apart the barrier of one's heart. The sound continued for nearly 6 seconds before slowly fading away, leaving only an echo that reverberated through the forest.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you successfully dodged the fear effect.】

Suddenly, Zhao Xu saw his status panel flash with this message.

Moreover, he didn't know the source of the sound, so the message didn't display the origin of the sound.

"Wind." Xia Lü called out Zhao Xu's name in a hurried tone.

Zhao Xu turned around, startled by the unusual tone, and found that the female mage, Xia Lü, was shaking all over, with a trembling that was not trivial.

Zhao Xu's face immediately changed color.

If Xia Lü continued like this, the VR brain control device's player protection function would likely activate, forcibly disconnecting her.

In theory, even if she failed to dodge, Xia Lü's divine protection would not be so oppressive.

Moreover, the creepy laughter had already disappeared.

"She's being affected by the failed dodge state," Xia Lü said hurriedly.

However, she didn't have a temporary solution to help Xia Lü.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that the creepy laughter was the first wave of attack.

He and Xia Lü, with their powerful willpower, had dodged it, while Xia Lü had failed, so she was affected by the fear effect.

When Zhao Xu first saw the giant dragon, he had been suppressed by the opponent's "fierce" supernatural ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, after he had been exempted from failure, although he was not afraid, the negative effects of exemption failure continued to harass him, even affecting his normal magical performance. It wasn't until the fear time had passed that he recovered.

Similarly, the shadow was also affected by the negative effects of exemption failure. Her mental state, which was already somewhat unbalanced, was further exacerbated.

She was now in a state of complete unease, as if she had really been startled. Normal players who had endured the fear duration could recover normally. However, this approach was not suitable for the shadow.

The female mage, Lu, whispered to Zhao Xu, "Resuscitation."

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed slightly, and he was surprised that Lu was so straightforward in reminding him to use a specific spell.

He still used the spell too boldly.

The "Lion's Heart" that Zhao Xu had once used on the eighth floor corridor was actually an immunity to fear spell. The only drawback was that it was only effective for a short duration.

Now, the shadow was already in a state of fear, and releasing the immunity spell had no effect on her. It was as if she had gone off the rails.

Lu's prompt "Resuscitation" was a spell similar to a stop-loss spell. As an extension of the priest's and paladin's divine magic, it was not part of the standard divine gift. It was usually obtained through external means.

The main effect of Resuscitation was to allow the recipient to retry their exemption after exemption failure.

It was like giving someone who had already failed a dice roll another chance to try again.

Although the difference in strength was significant, it was still difficult to salvage. However, for some people who were simply unlucky, it was indeed a lifesaving opportunity.

The current shadow was such a case. As a mage, her intention to exempt herself was not low. Zhao Xu and others could exempt themselves, and of course, the shadow could too.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu immediately used the vacant spell slot of the scholar of the ancient art to cast the "Revival" spell, relying on his precognitive abilities. Slowly, a pure recovery energy condensed in Zhao Xu's palm.

This is a contact spell, similar to a healing spell, which requires physical contact to transfer the spell's effect. Zhao Xu then placed his palm on the shadow's forehead, touching it gently.

At this time, the shadow's entire body was barely able to squat due to its weakened state, and it would have collapsed if not for the support of the nearby trees.

After the energy beam passed through the shadow's forehead and entered its body, it took exactly three seconds before the female mage, Shadow, let out a weak voice, saying, "Thanks, I'm fine."

Her voice was hoarse, like that of a patient who had just recovered from a serious illness.

"Are you okay?" Shadow slightly bent down and asked, looking up at Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu also lowered his head, trying to look at Shadow's face.

However, the dark red sky, as if stained by blood, did not reflect much light. Zhao Xu felt uneasy, wondering if he should cast the "Umbra's Eye" spell, which would grant him dark vision and allow him to see through ordinary and magical darkness.

He knew that this dark forest was created by magic. The eerie laughter just now was probably one of the forest's effects.

"I'm fine," Shadow said, struggling to stand up.

Normally, she would show a reliable image to others, but this was the first time she had appeared so weak in front of someone else.

"Thank you," Shadow whispered, nodding slightly towards Zhao Xu.

"No need, Shadow told me to use Revival," Zhao Xu replied.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu looked slightly embarrassed and said that at the time, he had missed the opportunity to cast an immune fear spell and had forgotten that there was a "resurrection" spell that could terminate the state.

In fact, at a higher level, there were even more spells that could counter various negative effects, but Zhao Xu could only use these ordinary level 1 spells to get by for now.

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, Luo smiled and shook her head, saying, "It's because you told me to stop just before I fell into fear."

Zhao Xu heard this and knew that Luo was referring to the habit of leaving a rescue signal after falling into the abyss.

He smiled and said, "I know you're trying to remind me, but I appreciate it. However, I think it's unnecessary to remind me like that."

Luo thanked him and said, "I know you're trying to remember, so I reminded you. But I'm grateful that you did. Otherwise, I would have been cut off just now."

Zhao Xu accepted her gratitude, but it sounded a bit awkward.

He smiled and said, "Thank you, but don't think that I didn't hear the sound of clothes rustling behind me."

The two female mages, who had been quite stern, looked embarrassed.

Zhao Xu, who had received a +4 enhancement to his hearing after his sudden burst of laughter, heard the sound of their secret conversation.

Luo continued to insist, saying, "You can hear this, so how did you not hear me cast the resurrection spell?"

Zhao Xu laughed and said, "I'm not really asking you, but telling you a fact."

At the time, Zhao Xu was in a state of psychological unease, so he hadn't even heard Luo's hint.

On the other hand, Luo, who was also a woman, had heard it.

"Let's go," Zhao Xu said, standing up.

The two female mages followed him, and the three of them began to continue their journey, analyzing the cause and effect of what had just happened.
Here is the translation of the text:

In just a few words, the whole story of what happened can be pieced together. According to my analysis, that strange noise belongs to a regional sonic attack, which should come in waves. At first, they felt something was off because they were being subjected to a terrifying sonic pressure in another region.

Later, when that terrifying sound wave attacked their area, they were almost exempt from the negative consequences. Fortunately, their willpower was strong enough to resist, and two of them managed to survive.

If they had been completely wiped out, it would have been like waiting for death. The reason they suspect it's a regional effect is that the duration of the fear effect is 120 rounds (12 minutes). This is also why they think it's a regional effect, rather than a strange spell or monster ability that can last for so long.

Even Zhao Xu, who was hit by the dragon's roar, needed to endure for 5D6 (5-30) rounds.

This may also suggest that after 12 minutes, the sound will attack again. Therefore, Zhao Xu and the others hastened their pace and crossed a thorny forest, with even the armor of the mage's robes being torn and battered.

Just as they were about to glance at each other, they discovered the vast expanse before them. A massive chasm stretched across the original flat terrain, revealing a deep, bottomless pit.

As they gazed at the precipice, they adjusted the position of their invisible servants and approached silently. At this moment, the crimson moon seemed to be drawn closer by an immeasurable amount, with the moon's shadow resembling a half-moon mirror reflecting in the deep pit on the opposite side, gazing at them from afar.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu lightly kicked a small stone down the deep pit, making sure he couldn't hear any echo, and then retreated three meters away.

"Here's a stele," said Lu, squatting nearby, with Zhao Xu and the Shadow hurrying over.

The stele was only about half a meter tall, lying horizontally in the ground, with several cracks already appearing on its surface, like a spider's web.

"If you can decipher the curse of the stele, you will see the bridge to the other side," said the Shadow, speaking out loud.

The chasm was at least several hundred meters wide, and ordinary people would find it difficult to cross without wings.

"That's what we should do," said the Shadow, suggesting they decipher the stele.

Lu gazed down at the deep pit, nodding slowly as she spoke, "Then let's do it this way."

Generally, following a logical thought process would easily lead to a trap set by the opponent.

Even if they succeed in deciphering the stele, there's a chance that the bridge will appear, but the pursuers may surround them on both sides.

So, it's better to jump out of the opponent's thought process and fly across the bridge when the time is right. This is especially true for those who are already in a critical situation.

However, the "flying disk" spell can only be used when it's more than one meter above the ground, so it's not suitable for their flying needs.

At this point, the three of them began to gaze at the mysterious text on the bottom of the stele, preparing to decipher it.

"I'm afraid it requires a very high level of knowledge (mystery) to do so," concluded the Shadow, focusing intently on the text.

As the three of them were the highest-level players in the game, with a combined level of 2, but their knowledge (mystery) skill was at level 5.

If they're as tricky as this, there aren't many players who can handle it.

"Help, save us quickly!"

Suddenly, a cry for help came from behind Zhao Xu and the others.

The three of them all looked back with solemn faces.
Three men with faces covered in blood are running out of the mysterious forest, and they are the same three wizards who were initially seated across from the campfire.
