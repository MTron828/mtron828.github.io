Chapter 498: The Prisoner of Death

North Alliance, outside of Auror City.
Above the sky, the snowflakes continued to fall, dyeing the originally bright blue sky white. The bustling streets outside the city had turned silent. Nature had simply used its weather powers to paralyze the main roads in the middle of the alliance, and the packs of wolves that came with the autumn wind had dwindled in number.

If it weren't for the Eternal Winter River, which flowed through the port and was not frozen, it would have been impossible to continuously transport goods from outside into the city, and prices would have skyrocketed to the sky.

As for Zhao Xu at this moment, he was calmly riding the "Ice Desert Horse", which had cold-blooded heritage. However, breeding such creatures was difficult, and the Auror City could only raise about a hundred. Otherwise, it would be impossible to establish a cavalry corps to launch an attack on the ice mountain range in the winter.

Inside the carriage, a prisoner was lying on the floor, wearing prison clothes and covered in wounds. His wounds had been treated, but blood continued to seep out. This prisoner was Oscar, the brother of the six sisters.

The entire northern region was as ruthless as ever, and the "Dark Devil", who could stop a child's crying, couldn't be imagined at this moment. Oscar lay motionless, like a dead dog, on the floor. As a 10-level wanderer, even though Oscar was crippled and couldn't lift his hand, the alliance still specifically set up a series of shackles to restrict his movements.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah, who would have thought that I still have a day to see the outside sun and water prison," Oscar said with a dry laugh.

Zhao Xu listened and replied coldly, "Don't think you can survive. As long as I can ensure their safety, I will kill you without hesitation."

"Oh?" Oscar asked and coughed, "It seems you know my story?"

"Ah."

Zhao Xu looked at the snow outside with a disgusted expression, so pure and clean.

In his past life, he had heard about Oscar's crimes. However, back then, the other party had never had the opportunity to be released.

Or, in that council, everyone was hotly discussing various plans, but only Zhao Xu knew that Oscar was not the biological brother of the six sisters.

They and Oscar had only a superficial relationship, like "sister's brother".
So Zhao Xu was suspicious, wondering what had caused this "butterfly storm" that had led the six sisters to take such a big risk and expose the hidden disk in the headquarters.

To know that they had already arranged spies around Lady Alyssa's body, and even going further, it was not impossible to directly assassinate the leader Tang De.

Suddenly, they wasted their efforts on Fleur and Lady Alyssa, not to mention they couldn't get what they wanted.

At this moment, Oscar coughed and said with difficulty, "So it seems I'm really going to die."

"But I'm definitely inside, I've never betrayed them, why do they still want me dead? I just want to live well, is it that hard?"

Oscar's face was not just pale, but his facial muscles had sunken in, as if he had been suffering from a disease for many years.

"Is it because you want to live, that's the reason you've wounded people's hearts?" Zhao Xu sneered.

"Ah, you high-and-mighty people, how can you imagine that we, who are struggling to make ends meet, can't even afford to buy medicine, and have to seek out such quack remedies?" Oscar's voice trembled as he seemed to be touched to the core.

"Yes, very good, eating human flesh can also give you a sense of morality," Zhao Xu said with a sneer, looking down at Oscar, who was lying on a makeshift bed of grass, as the cold wind from outside continued to seep in.

"I've read your file," Zhao Xu said coldly. "What about that innocent girl who died first? She pitied you and gave you some food, but you exploited her kindness and killed her."

"In that moment, you had no right to complain about the world being cruel to you, because you had already given up your conscience," Zhao Xu pointed out.

Suddenly, Oscar's eyes flashed with a "medium-level" evil aura, which lingered for a long time.

"This is all there is to say," Zhao Xu evaluated. "You've never atoned for your own mistakes, and the evil aura on your body has reached a medium level, almost reaching the level of 'strong'."

"And wasn't it because you were weak and unable to fight back against adults that you attacked that little girl?" Zhao Xu ridiculed. "With your physical condition, you say you've never done anything more serious? Who would believe you?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, it seems you're also like those who interrogated me, trying to get information from me. Why is it that a weak person like me can reach level 10 and above?"

As Oscar said this, he gazed at Zhao Xu with a mocking expression, as if to say that you're also the same kind of trash.

"Not just the devil's trick?" Zhao Xu sneered.

At this moment, he had already dispatched his subordinates, Serus and Vivian, to a certain location according to his plans.

"Do you really think there's no price to pay?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Haha." Oscar's eyes lit up with excitement, as if he had found a companion, "You're also familiar with this kind of thing?"

"No." Zhao Xu revealed a bitter smile, "I'm a wizard, so I'm clear about the devil's tricks."

As he spoke, he also revealed a sorrowful expression.

His companions had also been lured by the devil's tricks and fallen into the abyss.

Many secrets about the devil had been revealed after the war against the devil.

"Do you think that the devil's gift you received, which allows you to eat human hearts, has no price?" Zhao Xu asked.

"How do you know?" Suddenly, Oscar's expression changed to one of tension.

"No matter how they interrogate me, I won't betray them. How do you know?" Oscar asked.

"I don't need to know," Zhao Xu said, "Just cooperate with me in this performance, and it'll be fine."

As he spoke, he gazed out at the vast expanse of white.

"It's getting late, let's get moving."

Then Zhao Xu turned back into the carriage.

"Go and repent to those you've killed."

"I'm telling you these things because the price of that elixir is that your soul will be harvested after you die and become the lowest form of garbage in the abyss."
