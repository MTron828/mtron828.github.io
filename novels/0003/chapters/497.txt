Here is the translation:

"Ha ha, it seems you're just like those who interrogate me, also wanting to know the reason why I, a weak person, can reach level 10 or above. Say, Oscar, looking at me with a mocking gaze, as if saying you're just as worthless as I am.

"Not just devilish tactics?" Oscar sneered.

At this point, he had already transmitted the information to "White Dragon" Serus and Saint Warrior Vivi in Aurora City, according to his arrangement, and they were heading to a certain location.

"Do you really think there's no price to pay?" Oscar asked again.

"Haha," Oscar's eyes lit up with excitement, as if he had found a comrade, "You've also touched on this aspect?"

"No," Zhao Xu revealed a bitter smile, "I'm a mage, so I'm clear about the devil's tactics."

As he spoke, he also revealed a sorrowful expression.

He had once had a comrade who was also lured by the devil's tactics and fell into the abyss.

Many secrets about the devil were revealed after the Seal War.

"Do you think the devil's gift you received, which allows you to eat human hearts, has no price to pay?" Zhao Xu asked.

"How do you know?" Suddenly, Oscar, who was lying down, revealed a tense expression.

"I don't need to know," Zhao Xu said. "Regardless of how they question me, I won't reveal anything, but you'll cooperate with me in this performance, and that's all."

As he spoke, he looked out at the vast expanse.

"It's late in the day, let's get moving."

Immediately, Zhao Xu turned back to the carriage.

"Go and atone for killing those people."

"I'm telling you all this because the price of that elixir is that after you die, your soul will be harvested and become the lowest scum in the abyss."
