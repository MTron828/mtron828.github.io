Chapter 474: The Giant Dragon's Breath from the Mage

As soon as the command was issued, the Silver Golem and Golden Golem simultaneously took a few strides towards the "Fiery Red Lips" secret library.

With each step they took, the ground shook in synchronization, as if a steel piano was playing a dramatic melody.

"Hold your horses!" A warrior with a shield appeared, blocking their path. Despite being the guardian of Fiery Red Lips, he couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation as he gazed at the massive golems before him.

He had already made up his mind to abandon his shield and flee if things didn't go according to plan.

However, fate had other plans.

In the blink of an eye, the Golden Golem lifted its leg, which was as sturdy as a pillar supporting the sky, and stomped down on the warrior.

Crunch!

The Golden Golem's unique ability kicked in, accelerating its pace to the point where it left a lingering shadow on the retina.

"Ahh——"

A chilling scream echoed through the air, cutting off abruptly after just one syllable.

The guards who were about to rush to the scene saw the scene unfold, and their firm determination, which had been cultivated through rigorous training, shattered on the spot.

For a living person was being crushed beneath the Golden Golem's foot, right before their eyes.

"Ahh!"

"He's dead!"

This gruesome scene sent the residents on the street screaming, and the newly opened doors and windows were hastily shut, with no one daring to make a sound.
Here is the translation of the text:

This has already become a battle that surpasses their cognitive level. If they want to watch the show and then brag about it, they'll have to survive until the end.

No one wants to be targeted by these two "killer demons" like monsters.

Zhou Xu had once used the secret silver golem to entangle the golden golem and prevent the opponent from launching a similar trampling attack.

At this moment, the two golems took a few big steps forward and raised their massive weapons, which were shaped like the bodies of the golems, to attack the beautifully decorated main door.

The archer hiding in the watchtower had already shot an arrow at the two golems.

However, for them, the "defense level" and "damage reduction" abilities were just trivial matters.

"Bang!"
"Boom!"
A thick smoke rose up, and the secret silver golem had slashed down on a supporting column, causing the entire front wing of the building to collapse.

At this moment, the originally lively courtyard, filled with the sounds of laughter, noise, and movement, was suddenly filled with cries of surprise. The guests who had been immersed in the atmosphere all realized that this was not just a simple ground tremor.

As the two golems had attracted the attention of most of the people, they had also caused a huge commotion for the fiery red lips. Zhou Xu nodded in satisfaction.

Next, it was his turn to perform.

"Super Magic Control, Spell Maintenance, Spell Effectiveness."
"The Breath of the Dragon!"
Instantly, the continuous spell that had been cast, directly enhancing Zhou Xu's body.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have obtained the Golden Dragon's Breath, radius 5 meters, damage 80 points, duration: 24 hours】
Originally, this spell could bring 1-8 points of breath damage to the caster every two levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

Under the extreme influence of Zhao Xu's spell, the direct damage was 8 points, and then the spell level of his caster reached 10 levels. Finally, there were 80 points of fire damage, and even if the reflection succeeded, it would still be 40 points of damage.

Unless someone above level 5 or 6, it would be basically impossible to survive under the effect of this Dragon's Breath. Zhao Xu charged forward at that moment.

The two golems were limited by their attacking methods, attacking only one or two isolated targets each round, which was also their greatest weakness. Zhao Xu approached and then puffed out his cheeks.

Suddenly, a torrent of fire elemental energy accumulated in his mouth, followed by a tickle in his throat, and he opened his mouth wide and blew out a mouthful of air.

It looked like a child playing with sputum, but for a mage, it was a deadly fire of death. A massive, solid fireball erupted from his mouth, with an extremely high temperature, like a fire dragon spouting forth, directly engulfing the enemies beneath the golems' feet.

These guards, who had just mustered the courage to fight, couldn't even cry out for mercy; they were directly hit by a wave of scorching heat that enveloped their entire bodies.

In an instant, they couldn't even cough, accompanied by the intense pain brought by the thick smoke and high temperature. They died on the spot.

After the Dragon's Breath was released, the 5.5-meter radius of its effect was not wide-ranging, but it directly knocked out the guards of the entire courtyard. They were blackened and motionless on the ground, basically dead.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you are using Dragon's Breath (Golden Dragon), with a cooldown time of 1-4 rounds, and 2 rounds remaining.】
Zhao Xu nodded silently, having mastered this spell, the strongest weapon of the giant dragon, with the help of his persistence and expertise.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even this top-level version of him has reached the limit of harm. From the third circle to the fourth circle, his continuous harm has risen from ordinary physical harm to area harm. It's no longer the simple "cloud of sharp blades" or "malicious touch" like before.

"Mr. Wizard, that's the one," he said.

"That's the one who's driving away those two demonic illusions and attacking us," he added.

Just then, a few wizards in robes rushed over from the courtyard behind, and they witnessed the gruesome scene.

One of the guards, who was lucky enough to be standing outside the dragon's breath range, was running and shouting towards them.

The two wizards, who were usually half-guardians and half-enjoyers of service, quickly raised their wands and began to chant incantations.

"Ignis!" the wizards shouted in unison.

Two fireballs simultaneously descended and hovered in front of Zhao Xue's eyes.

However, Zhao Xue's super-magic wand was faster, and he didn't even need to think twice before shaking it off.

"Magic release, invalid boundary!"

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you cast the fourth-circle spell "Invalid Boundary" to ignore spells of the first to third circles.】

As a glowing, fixed magical sphere enveloped Zhao Xue, the two fireballs that had been accompanied by high thermal energy instantly disappeared upon contact.

Immediately outside the sphere, a massive thermal wave erupted.

The invalid boundary spell can ensure that no spell of the third circle or lower can take effect within a radius of three meters.

"Crashing sound."
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, Zhao Xu noticed the strange noise behind him and turned around to see another mage sneaking up to attack him. The other mage was holding a staff and had just cast a spell, but it had failed. The secondary shield of the four rings, which was actually the "Cruel God's Instrument", had been activated. Although Zhao Xu couldn't leave the shield's range, he had already made the low-level mages retreat without any achievement. In the split second it took Zhao Xu to deflect the spell, the two golems had also raised their massive weapons, each one in their hand, and struck the two low-level mages. Eventually, these golems could kill these low-level mages who had no defensive abilities as easily as killing chickens.

As Zhao Xu stepped on the fresh blood on the ground and walked into the courtyard, the guards who had been blocking the entrance had all died, with expressions of utter disbelief on their faces. A few guests who hadn't finished dressing yet came crawling and running out. Zhao Xu looked at them coldly and asked, "Where's Kulose?"

The guests, who thought Zhao Xu was there to escort them, shouted in anger, "Who are you? How dare you talk to us like this?"

"Ha! You think you're someone just because you're wearing a mage's robe? I'll write a letter to the association, prohibiting apprentices from wearing formal mage robes."

"Dead men tell no tales," Zhao Xu said with a smile, and his mouth began to water again.

The fire-breathing technique!
There was no trial, no strict order to decide.
It was just a chance encounter in a revenge scenario, and these guests died because of their loose tongues and being in the wrong place.
This is the difference between the chaotic camp and the orderly camp.
Zhao Xu's killing freedom certificate, without judicial review.
As Zhao Xu walked away after exhaling, he gazed at the several corpses that had been incinerated into charcoal, their faces and clothes indistinguishable. He silently crossed over them and continued moving forward.

The two demon images followed him, their swords clashing with Zhao Xu's flames, instantly becoming the fastest way to death in this region, directly taking away everyone.

The entire area was filled with the sounds of wailing and crying, with people running wildly and desperately, and most buildings were already on fire, burning fiercely. In contrast, just half an hour ago, the scene was one of peace and tranquility.

Suddenly, with a heavy step, a curtain dropped, revealing a man and woman trembling inside. Zhao Xu's eyes immediately recognized the fat man as the financial officer of the current alliance, who had once withheld their salary from the Starfall Town. The woman beside him was a servant from here.

"Please spare me, I'll compensate you with a lot of money," the fat man begged, having just seen Zhao Xu's path of slaughter through the curtain.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but think of the man's wife at home, who was so gentle, yet had also come to such a place. However, after his gaze shifted to the woman's age, Zhao Xu shook his head, turned his back, and waved his hand down.

A flash of silver light.
The secret silver demon image immediately raised its heavy sword, piercing the fat man's heart, leaving him with an expression of utter disbelief.

"No need to come to such a place," Zhao Xu said without turning his head.

"Just like the Demon King of Murder," Zhao Xu added.

"Deploy the array," someone said.
As the rapid footsteps echoed outside, Zhao Xuan turned around, discovering that the city guards who had been patrolling the area and the fiery-red-lipped guards had finally converged, blocking his path.

"What's the location of the Kurōze?" Zhao Xuan asked, his tone devoid of any hint of magic.

It seemed as though everything was just a routine matter, with no concern for whether he would get an answer.

"Hmph, it's not something you can know, noble," a guard retorted, his face filled with anger, before drawing his long sword and charging towards Zhao Xuan.

Zhao Xuan nodded slightly and let out a sigh.

"Then you should go first," he said.

Flames erupted, engulfing everyone in their path.
