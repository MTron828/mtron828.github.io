Chapter 108: A Different Path

Zhao Xu, who had once been an officer of the law, couldn't help but think that even in a small town without any notable adventurers, this kind of murder case was extremely rare.

As he saw the scene before him, he realized that there was no need to look for any evidence or intelligence.

The entire room was in disarray, with various drawers and cabinets overturned, and the books on the large desk scattered all over the place.

A bottle of ink on the desk had been knocked over, and the ink was flowing down the legs of the desk, dripping onto the victim's feet.

"Is this a case of burglary?" Feng Ye whispered to himself, looking at the scene.

The situation seemed to suggest that it was indeed a case of burglary, and the remote and damp environment made it the perfect setting for a crime.

Zhao Xu shook his head, acknowledging that the underworld forces did indeed have connections with the Roaming Association, but they were not entirely overlapping.

Within the underworld forces, there were distinct differences between the thieves' gang and the assassins' gang.

As Zhao Xu's past experiences as an officer of the law had given him some insight into the inner workings of the underworld forces.

"Not the same," Zhao Xu said, looking at the victim, a fortune teller who was the target of their mission to gather intelligence. "The killer came in, killed the victim with one swift stroke, and then methodically searched the room for what they wanted. That's why there's ink covering the blood."

Zhao Xu had already walked up to the victim's body and was carefully checking the victim's clothes. His pupils constricted slightly as he discovered that there were no signs of binding or interrogation.
Here is the translation:

"Criminals don't need to be found anymore?" Rainbow, the wanderer, asked, taking in the entire room's situation. "Maybe we can still find some clues here."

Zhao Xu shook his head. "It's meaningless. This time, even the merchant's caravan will likely have to return. This is no longer just a simple murder case."

Zhao Xu's judgment was always correct, and subsequent developments verified the correctness of his thinking.

As they thought this, Maple Leaf and Rainbow didn't say much, and followed Zhao Xu out of the place.

Thanks to Zhao Xu's timely use of his mage identity to scare off the thieves from the Tower of the Lin family, the others didn't dare to follow them. Otherwise, if they had been noticed by them after entering the scene of the crime, the three of them would undoubtedly be wanted.

After leaving, Zhao Xu, Maple Leaf, and Rainbow took cautious precautions to track back.

They poked into every nook and cranny, and only after confirming there were no stalkers did they directly join the crowd and leave Moon Bay Town.

Not until they reached the hidden location of the merchant's caravan did the three of them finally breathe a sigh of relief, slowly recounting their experiences to Roja.

Roja's expression changed several times as he listened to their account, his breathing also becoming uneven.

"Maybe this is just a case of seeing an opportunity and taking it, and the clues have been lost, but it won't affect our future plans," Roja said after taking a deep breath.

Zhao Xu's heart suddenly jolted.

It seemed their fates had reached this point.

"You still think that?" Zhao Xu said. "I don't think a wanderer of at least 2nd level would be killed so easily."
Here is the translation of the text:

Lao Yang's eyes widened in surprise, but he quickly suppressed his inner tension and explained, "Mr. Zhongxia, you're mistaken. The person who contacted you is just an expert in forging documents, and he's just an ordinary person with no combat skills."

Zhao Xu shook his head and lifted his hand slightly, indicating to Lao Yang to continue.

"Lao Yang, leader, I don't know why you're deceiving us about this, but some details are quite obvious."

Zhao Xu said calmly, "The calluses on someone's hand from practicing 'sneak attack' skills are different from those formed by forging documents. The size and location of the calluses are different."

Lao Yang was taken aback, not expecting his explanation to be refuted on the spot.

At this moment, a few people from the Maple Leaf faction also looked over, completely unprepared for Zhao Xu to discover this detail.

"That person should be an undercover agent sent by Kartan and Bos City in Moon Lake," Zhao Xu said slowly.

"If my guess is correct, it can explain the entire logic. Why wasn't the fortune teller captured by the merchant alliance's guards in Moon Lake, but was killed instead? Because some people have already discovered the weakness in Moon Lake and don't want to leak the information, so they used underground forces to resolve the issue."

Seeing Lao Yang's tired expression, Zhao Xu said with a hint of pity, "This also means that Kartan and Bos City may have been infiltrated by the merchant alliance to a certain extent. Otherwise, I don't think the merchant alliance would have the courage to cut off the enemy's claws in Moon Lake and not conduct an investigation."

A high-ranking operative, stationed in a remote town and posing as a ordinary contact person, is a bit extravagant.

Someone with the ability to perform a sneak attack, to say the least, is barely qualified to be a hitman.

At this point, even the most innocent-looking Youyou fell silent.
Here is the translation of the text:

The crisis level of this situation has become very apparent.

"Ah, Mr. Zhongxia, I didn't expect you, as a renowned earth adventurer, to have such a profound sense of ecological awareness about this town. I apologize for not realizing it earlier..."

"So you're going to continue on?" Zhao Xu replied calmly. "I don't think the Commercial Alliance would dispatch even basic reconnaissance forces if they knew we had a smuggling team like ours operating."

The rest of the conversation was cut off, and the entire tent fell silent. Zhao Xu had never been involved in smuggling, but Luo Ya was different. He had already sensed the awkward atmosphere and was still unwilling to give up, clearly intending to bet on his ability to get through it smoothly.

Zhao Xu's three trump cards were for him to use in acquiring experience on adventures, not protecting anyone.

Otherwise, he could have easily requested a proof from the Moon and Star Association of Moon's Edge Town.

"This leaves us with two options," Zhao Xu thought for a moment before speaking up. "We can either transport these goods back and consider it a failure or bury these things here and wait for a new development in the situation before making our next move. You can discuss it with your leader first."

Zhao Xu's latter sentence was almost saying he was waiting for Caeso and Butan City to fail.

At this point, Luo Ya stood up immediately, his tone carrying a hint of emotion, "Believe me, Mr. Zhongxia, I'm confident that under your guidance, we can successfully lead the entire team to the front lines. And in return, we will undoubtedly offer you a higher reward. I can even offer you a deal now..."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Alright then," Zhao Xu interrupted Luo Ya's eloquent speech.

"It's too late now, let's part ways," Zhao Xu said.

Ting-ting-ding, the tent began to be struck by the raindrops.

The clouds that had been suppressed for a long time finally couldn't hold on, and the gentle patter of the rain spread throughout the entire southern forest.

The summer rain season has finally arrived.
