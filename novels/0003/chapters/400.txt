Chapter 401: Divine Breath

The old man nodded silently as he saw Zhao Xu hand over the price. There was no room for negotiation on this line of business. This already meant that he had completed about seven or eight tenths of his business today.

The old man slightly raised his white eye, "You're making me lose my old capital. How about this? I'll consider it my first day of business, 90 gold coins. Can you accept it?"

Hearing this, Zhao Xu could only smile wryly.

A group of families with pooled funds were engaged in a zero-capital business, and they were actually making a loss? "Eighty gold coins, one price," Zhao Xu bite off.

At this moment, the old man also saw the determination in his eyes and gently put down the other book on the table, saying, "It's a deal."

Zhao Xu directly took out eight gold coins from his pocket and arranged them on the already worn-out wooden table.

The old man lightly scanned the scene and did not move forward to collect the goods, "Then take that magical book. Tonight at three o'clock in the morning, come to my doorstep. No more than two people can come."

"Okay."

Zhao Xu replied cheerfully and tucked the magical book into his pocket, then walked out the door.

"By the way..."

Suddenly, the old man stopped the two of them, and Zhao Xu was just about to step out of the door, having not fully left.

"Although you should know, I still want to remind you of the rules of this line of business: once the goods are out the door, they are not returnable."

"This is natural."

Zhao Xu said as he turned and walked away.

"If this book is fake, we can't hold the seller accountable?"
As a Saint Warrior, Vivian found it difficult to understand why some people would trade something of little value for something of great value. "This is just a way to break the rules," she said. "It's like buying a fake product and then trying to return it for a refund."

"I think the demonic family would definitely enjoy this kind of trading method," Vivian replied.

"That's mainly because nobody dares to provoke the demonic family," Zhao Xiu explained. "Discovering a fake return is the easiest, and then there's the option of damaging the item and returning it as defective. And sometimes, they even create fake returns."

As they walked down a narrow alleyway, the eaves above them casting a shadow over the winter morning sun. "This is just a ordinary magic notebook," Zhao Xiu said.

"It records the experimental ideas of an immature four-ring wizard, which was rejected by Dragan, a seven-hundred-year-old wizard, due to the impracticality of the concept," he explained.

Stone Skin is a 250-gold-coin material that can absorb over a hundred points of damage, making it a well-known lifesaving spell among four-ring wizards.

Although the foundation of magic has become increasingly solid, many wizards can only perform minor repairs.

However, it is built on a self-contained and complete logic, or in other words, magic has been progressing.

This is also one of the reasons why ancient magic notes are often incomplete and disorganized. They have gone through a natural selection process and have been preserved and passed down through the ages. Most useless items are discarded or destroyed.

Here is the translation of the text:

Even if the legendary notebook is passed down, those magical notebooks are easily mistaken for recording some debunked incorrect magical theories, which would greatly diminish their value as antiques.

Unless it's a notebook that records the final structure of magic spells after the invention of the "spell-breaking technique" by a legendary figure like Morgan le Fay, then it would be extremely valuable, worth tens of millions of gold coins.

Including the notebook personally written by Anastasia, the value would be impossible to estimate.

At this moment, Vivian couldn't help but show a disappointed expression, "Doesn't this mean that the value of this notebook has greatly decreased?"

"You think we could possibly trade it for 80 gold coins?" Zhao Xu laughed, "However, we're definitely not going to lose out on this. The paper used in this manuscript is carefully selected, and after recording the magic, it automatically possesses a special mystical power."

"So it can be used as a incomplete spellbook, and selling it for 200 gold coins is definitely possible."

This is the reason Zhao Xu is interested in this magical manuscript.

He's not interested in the artistic value of the recorded magical script or its historical significance in the field of magic.

He's purely considering its practical value after being dismantled.

While others think he wants to buy that genuine but worthless decorative bead, in reality, he wants to buy the box that stores the precious bead.

At this moment, the old man in the magical material store suddenly stood up from his hunched posture.

He took out a notebook from his pocket and began to meticulously record the details of the two people's interactions and the entire transaction process as an archive.

The black market can survive for a hundred years in the alliance, naturally, it has its own reasons for survival.

As she took a deep breath, she couldn't help but sigh and say, "My eyes aren't bad, I've jumped into the real magical tome, but the problem is that I don't know where to find a valuable magical tome that's worth selling. Well, even if it's just an old book worth 50 gold coins, I can still sell it. If I'm lucky, I can get 70-80 gold coins. That's good enough for now."

...As the clock struck midnight, the entire street was empty, with not a single person in sight, not even from the Northern Alliance, which was known for its lax enforcement of curfews. It was as if they were the only ones left in the world.

As they made their way through the shadows, they finally arrived at the agreed-upon meeting spot for the magical material store. But to their surprise, a cart was already parked there.

"It smells a bit weird," Vivian said, accustomed to the acrid smell of burning trash from her time in the depths of the abyss. But this time, it was a pungent smell of human waste.

"It was probably used for transportation purposes," Zhao Xu said, pulling open the carriage door and getting in. "Otherwise, a cart driving around at midnight would be quite suspicious."

"Shall we go?" the coachman asked, looking at the two of them with a hint of understanding.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied.

As they rode, Zhao Xu noticed that the coachman was deliberately taking them on a detour, driving in circles before finally heading in the right direction.

This kind of trickery was meaningless to the two mages.

It wasn't until they had been traveling for over 20 minutes that Zhao Xu noticed the cart slowing down. When he got out of the cart, he found that they had arrived at some kind of warehouse-like place. There were dozens of carts parked alongside, and it was clear that they weren't the only ones there.

"My name is Salarzi. From now on, I'll be your guide. Any transactions you make will have to go through me," said the young coachman, who looked to be in his late twenties.

At once, he led the two of them to the corner of the warehouse, where the floorboards had already been lifted, revealing a bright and spacious underground tunnel.

Zhao Xiu nodded to himself, thinking that it was unlikely that the city's authorities did not know about the excavation of a large space beneath the city.

Following the guide assigned to them, Zhao Xiu and Wei Wei walked ahead in the underground tunnel.

No one could have imagined that, instead of being a sewage system, this location was secretly hiding a massive market for magical items and antiques.

The air in the underground tunnel was clean and well-ventilated.

Zhao Xiu was thinking about what to do if a battle broke out and he needed to break through here.

"First of all, I need to remind you that all the items claimed to be 'magic items' here are actually items that have been verified to be able to emit magical light. Unless they are damaged and unable to emit light, they will immediately notify you." Salarza said.

Zhao Xiu's expression changed slightly.

It seemed that the magic items underground were of different levels.

However, most magic items that could normally emit magical light after being verified would be sold at open prices.

Except for a few that had been tampered with, pretending to be magical or altered to evade verification, these types of items were rare.

Buying these items had lost the thrill of "treasure hunting" and was more about a simple purchase.

However, it was the ones that had lost their effectiveness over time, even if they were detected emitting magical light, that posed the greatest challenge.

These items were also the most coveted by buyers.

Just then...
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Vivian's footsteps came to a halt. She brought a hint of "I almost said it" and glanced at Zhao Xu, then activated her telepathic communication ability to connect with him.

"I just received a message from Madam May," she said.

Zhao Xu raised an eyebrow slightly, surprised that Vivian and the other party were still maintaining this level of connection, even transmitting messages over a thousand miles.

"'Message' is approximately the content that the seal of the sacred breath has been touched, and the executor of the evil ritual is about to bring it down from the sky in the next few hours."

"'May's intention is that if we have the intention, we can look up at the dawn, wait for the disaster to arrive, and then go to the local area to find the opportunity of fate."

"At that time, the falling star will bring destruction to everything, but also bring new opportunities."

Sacred breath!

Zhao Xu thought back to the previous day, when he had joked about the catastrophe that would shake the alliance and surrounding countries five years later.

The falling star that had actually arrived the next day?

Zhao Xu's mind flashed back to the scene of him breaking into the mysterious nest and getting the bronze box.

That was also an evil ritual. Was it related to this?

Zhao Xu's mind was clear.

According to May's words, the sacred breath was a mysterious object comparable to a divine artifact, which was probably sealed in the sky.

If his guess was correct, the evil ritual was the way to obtain the sacred breath.

However, it seemed that he had been destroyed.

Or maybe it was destroyed in a previous life, with the only difference being the timing five years later.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the master of the ceremony lost the way to ascend, he decided to rely on another method to achieve his goal. On one hand, the adventurers who rushed to the scene were enemies of the mastermind behind the scenes. On the other hand, they were also the vanguard who had already rushed ahead, serving as cannon fodder to clear the way. However, time was now extremely urgent. As Vivia said, it had already happened not long after dawn. The artifact that transcended the divine, Lark, could not display its full strength in front of Zhao Xu at the peak of his powers. Therefore, "Divine Breath", a legendary artifact said to be able to reverse the effects of the area, would undoubtedly greatly boost his strength. Zhao Xu's gaze became resolute as he thought about this. He directly glanced at his character panel, which displayed his equipment.

Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu gazed at the equipment on his body, and without realizing it, he found that he had a total of 14 pieces of equipment, valued at 1.86 million gold coins. Although the majority of it was the 15 million gold coin "Soulless Staff" and the 170,000 gold coin "Higher Instantaneous Staff", the remaining 20 million gold coins or so were almost all obtained from the auction house in Anzhiya.

However, to be honest, when Frank, the nine-ring mage, gave him the staff, it was only worth 30,000 gold coins at most. According to reason, it would be around 6 million gold coins at most. But Zhou Xu was able to restore it to its original price of 50,000 gold coins by using the fragments of the soul god. It was as if the soul god fragments had endowed him with at least 5 million gold coins.

However, Zhou Xu was still aware that his internal and external bodies, hands, arms, and fingers were still empty. If he were to make up his mind and intervene in the sudden "Sacred Pulse" dispute that had just broken out, he might have to rush to buy these magical items and complete his breakthrough from 0 to 1 tonight.

In his past life, he didn't know about the "Sacred Pulse" news at the time because he wasn't in the Northern Alliance. It was only later that he heard about it.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Currently, with the backstage mastermind wanting to obtain the long-sealed divine breath, it means that this news cannot be hidden.

Although the May lady is thousands of miles away, she relies on her own arrangements and realizes that the divine breath has changed, and thus informs them that it can be intercepted.

As for the other forces trying to intervene, there are probably not a few.

Zhao Xu immediately made up his mind.

Tonight, he must go shopping in advance before the new wave of price hikes for magic items appears after the divine breath appears. "Take me directly to the most expensive place," Zhao Xu instructed.
