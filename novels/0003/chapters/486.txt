Chapter 487: Secret of the Seal of Magic

As Anziano finished casting the spell, the stone floor beneath their feet, which had been as hard as steel, suddenly became as slippery as a swimming pool. The two mages immediately fell into the pit, transforming into a massive stone, rolling around at the bottom, and slowly sinking deeper into the ground.

After about ten minutes, Zhao Xu began to feel the constriction in his feet loosen, spreading to his entire body. The air rushing towards him was unlike the rocky air beneath, accompanied by an extremely pungent demonic odor.

Zhao Xu suddenly lost his balance, feeling as if he was weightless. He immediately activated his flight ability, slowly controlling the floating force to regain his balance and then descend to the ground, section by section.

Meanwhile, Anziano had already landed on the ground, standing upright with a look of deep thought on her face.

Before them was a vast, barren, and newly excavated rocky pit.

It was clear that the surrounding rocky walls had not been repaired, only carved out to create this space.

"It's quite primitive," Zhao Xu sighed.

As he spoke, he suddenly became vigilant, scanning their surroundings.

Even Zhao Xu felt that the scene before them was more perilous than when he had left the palace of El'Dor in the past.

What could be the reason?

Why would Tang De risk everything to excavate a place like this in the most important location in the northern alliance city, with no clear purpose?

Or was this place already existing before Tang De's ascension?
At the moment when the two of them landed, none of this was yet known to anyone.

"Let's go, see what kind of trick this lord of demons is going to play," Anzheniyo evaluated, with Zhao Xu quickly following.

"Drip, drip."

"Drip, drip."

Suddenly, a mysterious dripping sound came from a distance.

Zhao Xu immediately turned his head, looking towards the direction where the sound was coming from, "Is there something like stalactites here?"

At this time, relying on his true knowledge, his gaze pierced through the darkness in front of him and directly fell on a triangular prism at the top of the mine, where a liquid was seeping out, dropping one by one.

In the past, Zhao Xu and his companions had been trapped in a mountain cave, and they had brought dry food, but the water bottle had been broken on the way.

As a group of poor adventurers, they didn't need to drink water or eat, and the transparent crystal stone, worth 4000 gold coins, which they definitely didn't have.

As for the endless water source, worth 9000 gold coins, which no one would spend a fortune to buy, they relied on the dripping water that seeped out from the stone to quench their thirst, and even filtered out impurities in the water, separating large molecular particles, which was cleaner than filtering through sandstone.

However, Zhao Xu, who had just looked at the scene before him, felt a sense of nausea.

Because a pungent and bloody smell had blown into his nostrils through the wind.

"Do you know what this is?" Anzheniyo asked.

"It's a coffin of the damned," Zhao Xu recalled and said out loud, recalling the prelude to the demon ritual.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The special demon sacrifice ritual is used to kill innocent people, and it's best for adventurers of higher levels. The effects will be better the higher the level. Then, the body is buried in the stone wall, and the blood from the body seeps out of the stone and drips to the ground, creating a pathway to the altar. This way, the residual evil energy from the corpse will return to the altar, enhancing the altar's power."

Annie looked back at Zhao Xuan and asked, "Have you done any research on this topic before?"

"This knowledge is so detailed, it's unlikely that someone without extensive research in religious knowledge could know about it," Zhao Xuan replied with a hint of bitterness.

In the past, during the Seal of the Demon War, the entire earth was affected by a massive impact, and the players in the Northern Alliance were also affected. Zhang Qi was taken away by a group of demons on the battlefield. Later, Feng Ge died in the battlefield, worrying about Zhang Qi's fate.

After Zhang Qi's death, Feng Ge's spirit was brought back, and she wanted to find Zhang Qi's corpse and bury them together. A group of classmates, led by an old priest from the temple, found a mysterious mine and discovered the altar and ritual.

When Zhao Xuan and his friends reached the stone wall, Zhang Qi's corpse had already been crushed into a grotesque shape. Zhao Xuan, who had witnessed the death of his loved ones and friends, could only vent his rage by hacking at the altar, but it didn't change anything.

"Let's go," Annie said, as the blood pool on the ground had filled up and was slowly flowing down the narrow channel.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's gaze swept over the area in front of him, feeling the vibrations around him, and carefully listening, his senses tingling with a sense of trepidation.

"What do you know? Generally, these altars that require specific rituals are used for what?" Anzhiya asked.

Zhao Xu shook his head slightly.

The old pastor from his past life had only vaguely recognized it, and its specific effects were unclear.

"Summoning demons."

Zhao Xu's footsteps paused for a moment.

"Yes?" Anzhiya seemed to sense Zhao Xu's unusual reaction.

Summoning demons!
The Seal of the Demons!
In his past life, after crossing over several years, countless demons from the depths of the underworld and demons from hell descended from the sky.

No one knew where these scoundrels came from, and they simply scattered throughout every town, spreading chaos and destruction.

Some small towns that lacked sufficient military defense were instantly consumed by these hellish creatures, leaving nothing but desolate wastelands.

The entire Ice Mountain Range north of here became a sea of corpses, a true hell on earth.

Zhao Xu, who had entered the game at the beginning, had basically survived the initial turmoil, but ultimately, about 70% of them died in this demonic war.

Even Zhang Qi and Feng Ge, who would normally join him on an adventure, had already met their demise.

This was a bond forged through adversity, requiring no words to express their camaraderie.

But now, he had unexpectedly discovered the "clues" that would trigger the demonic war.

This place was still the most crucial location in the entire Northern Alliance, with daily decrees being issued from the Central Authority, the Grand Marshal's Office.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Instructor, how many demons can this altar bring over?"

The arrival of demons can be divided into two types. One is summoning, in which case, even if they die, they will only leave behind a shadow, without affecting their original bodies. However, the summoned bodies will disappear once the summoning time is up.

The other type is to take the "stealthy route" and directly transport demons over.

However, demons that are transported in this way will suffer severe losses if they die. For example, just like the deep-seated demon that Zhao Xu killed in the underground temple of the god of death, it will return to hell and start climbing the ranks from the lowest level demon.

At this moment, Anniya raises an eyebrow slightly, looking thoughtful, "Although I haven't seen the altar ahead, according to the demon aura here, it's likely that this is not a portal. It's just a simple summoning of demons. The intensity is estimated to be around the level of the 'Abysmal Legion' spell, summoning several wraiths, a Babu demon, and a level 9 Florian demon. These demons are all fully enhanced versions with high lifespans. They can also summon demons and, to a certain extent, build a portal through slaughter."

"It's not a portal?" Zhao Xu is astonished, "The demon army brought by the seal of the past war is real and won't disappear. It's not a portal?"

"It's not impossible, but if they have been carefully selected and attached to the ritual, they can build a portal through slaughter."

"The blood and soul of Arthur's reincarnation is the best nourishment for this demon's portal ritual."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, that is to say," Zhao Xu's voice dropped slightly, "the altar summoning the demon is the starting material. As long as the scale of the slaughter is sufficient, it can open a teleportation portal, and then rely on the slaughter of the newly arrived demons to maintain this teleportation portal."

"Yes, it is possible," Antinoja replied.

At this moment, they had reached the end of the blood-stained path.

Ahead, a scorching hot haze stretched out, with a sulfurous smell that made it hard to breathe.

Meanwhile, the underground seemed to have a dense fog outlet, causing the fog to form a massive wave, constantly crashing against each other.

"Ugh!"

Suddenly, a strange red glow emanated from the fog, and the sound of demon weeping echoed through.

In an instant, a deathly aura swept over Zhao Xu's mind, tightening his entire inner heart.

The next second, he felt an extremely evil aura rising from behind them.

A demon with a deformed horn appeared behind the two, its body covered in hot ash. Even its shadow directly enveloped Zhao Xu and Antinoja.

Not too early to yell, right?

At this moment, Zhao Xu's mind was overflowing with frustration. Suddenly, a familiar voice echoed in his ear.

This made him burst with an unbelieveable expression.

It's really you, descending personally!
