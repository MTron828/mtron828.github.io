Chapter 440: Exposing Names

【Forum Flash News: "The first 7th-level player appears, activates the 'Jump-out Clause', and sends the list of 7th- and 5th-level personnel to the TC planning committee."】

As the holiday season approached, with just a few days to go before the New Year, most people had already taken a break and were relaxing at home. As a result, online entertainment platforms saw a surge in online traffic.

At least Zhang Qi saw that many students who usually pushed their studies aside to focus on their studies were now logging in to dig for silver ore with pickaxes and shovels. The heat was intense, and this post instantly attracted all the online players.

At this moment, countless online players, with looks of confusion and bewilderment, clicked on the post that had just been placed at the top.

【Personnel List:

7th Level: 1 person (details: 7th-level mage "Zhou Xia")
6th Level: 0 people (details: none)
5th Level: 0 people (details: none)

Note: This time, the jump-out clause will correspond to the display of player names.]

As soon as the post was published, many forum players who had been mentally prepared to leave a comment "just like that" suddenly discovered that the list this time included a crucial name that they had not expected.

Moreover, this name was also one of the "hot choices" on the forum over the past two days.
Here's the translation of the text:

It seems that the post has exposed the "Mysterious Big Shot" in the game, which has caused the "Gamblers' Party" to be slapped in the face. 

"What's going on? Didn't we say that the 6th-level Big Shot, 'Starlight Reflection', was real?"

"Haha, actually, you guys should have known that Starlight Reflection has been claiming to be a player from the beginning, but there's no clue or evidence of him in the entire game. Not even one player knows him."

In the forum, there have been suspicions that Starlight Reflection might be an NPC, and now it's been confirmed. 

"I'm not saying he's a liar, but he might actually be an advanced NPC, or even a high-ranking military officer or noble. That kind of character with a scythe-like weapon, will you see another one like that?"

"And think about it, the tactics he used on the battlefield were beyond what a 4th-level mage could do. Not even a 7th-level mage like Zhong Xia, who just got promoted, can do that."

The posts that doubted Starlight Reflection's existence have all been buried, but this time they're being brought up again.

Under the corresponding post, there are comments that are being upvoted quickly, becoming top comments, and pushing the original post to the top.

"One thing to note is that the 'Ghost Strike' spell is not provided by the local magic library, and it's possible that no one knows about this spell. 

A 3rd-level mage player then comes out to explain, bringing with him a halo of credibility due to his level.
Here is the translation of the text:

After seeing someone's reply, he immediately continued to respond, saying that it's just a "delaying tactic" and that it's impossible to achieve the effect of the "starlight echo" that lasts for a long time. 

So, I guess the other person is a justice mage who cannot show their face but cannot bear to see the miner of the Starlight Town being bullied, so they're using a proxy player to take action. It's impossible for NPCs to have such complex organizations like us players do.

That's not true. The "starlight echo" account has joined the "Anti-Hit Alliance" strategy group, and the other person even presented a specific battle plan.

Haha, it's just a pretension. The plan is actually written by "Arthoria", who has led countless battles in the Heavenly Realm and the Furnace of Purgatory. It's like a textbook for countless players' strategic arrangements.

So, think about it, the powerful NPC must have passed the plan to us through a player, otherwise, how can you explain the fact that the other person has not logged in since then? It's like someone threw away a bunch of money in the sky.

Now, NPCs can arrange for players to make offline contacts, transmit information, and distribute a battle plan to the QQ group. Is it difficult for them to do so?

At this time, many discussion groups and game communities received this hot news. Even game information apps directly sent out pop-up notifications, attracting everyone's attention.
Here is the translation of the text:

About the first player in the game, it was originally a 7th-level player named "Zhōng Xià" who had recently been involved in a controversy surrounding the "Divine Tool".

This topic instantly sparked a heated debate about the relationship between "Zhōng Xià" and "Starlight Reflected".

Even the account of "Dōng Chéng Ruì" was overshadowed by the controversy.

【Please think about it, after Zhōng Xià left the Ai Zhuo Temple, he killed in all directions, and there were hundreds of corpses piled up. The death spell can be attributed to a powerful staff, but three-ring fireball, flying spell, and so on are all genuine.】

As the discussion continued to unfold, the entire forum began to clarify the thoughts of the participants.

In general, everyone had clarified the following points:

"Zhōng Xià" was undoubtedly the current first player in the game, and his two-level gap in strength also led people to speculate that he must have mastered some kind of "upgrade" channel.

As for the Starlight Reflected, it was suspected to be a high-level NPC mage in the game, with a special identity, but firmly standing on the side of the players.

【Alright, big brothers, let's stop arguing, I just want to ask, how did that Zhōng Xià become a 7th-level player? I'm also playing, but this is a bit too big of a gap.】

【Oh, I've been hit, I won't say anything, I'll go back to the game and make some money, at least I can earn some silver coins today.】

At the same time, Zhang Qi was also looking at the forum page with a dazed and hard-to-believe expression.

Even their chat group was blown up by this event, with every time someone logged in, they would immediately log out, only to log back in again, with a 99+ rating.

In comparison to the suspicion that "Wáng Níng Wēi" was behind the account "Dōng Chéng Ruì".

The account "Zhōng Xià" had been dug up by many players after being blessed by the Holy Breath.
Here is the translation of the text:

He has already had a presence in Mistral, and it's not just a fictional existence like the "star shadow" that suddenly appears. The credibility is even more terrifying.

The "Summer Solstice Fan Group" immediately opened a regional forum section, and the powerful influence of "the first player" instantly drew many strangers in. Even more so, it split into two factions, with half focusing on the "star shadow" fan group.

However, the account "star shadow" has the reputation of the first player of the Celestial Lake War, especially attracting many new players. The heat is still significant.

Zhang Qi silently liked the relevant section, and after that, the hot posts in that area will appear in his information feed.

"What's the Summer Solstice? He didn't even participate in the Celestial Lake War. A Mistral mage suddenly comes to dig up our Northern Alliance treasure. I'm not interested in this guy."

Li Tian Ge realized that everyone's emotions towards the original "star shadow" were deeper, and directly spoke with a wave-like rhythm.

"You're trying to force it, but he's now the first player. This title is destined to give him unparalleled influence in this game. Do you believe that as long as he posts something, there will be countless gold advertisements knocking on the door?"

Class leader Fang Xi Yue quickly rebutted.

"Okay, okay, there's nothing to argue about. At least he opened up a new path for us. It proves that our player's upper limit can continue to rise to level 7."

Cui Lu also participated in calming down.

"Yes, and it's possible that 'star shadow' and 'Summer Solstice' are actually the same account."

Zhang Qi also deliberately replied.

"Haha, you're not saying that East City Ruo's account is also his? When the three reunite, he can directly take off from the original place."

Li Tian Ge rebutted.

"What's taking off? That's divine."

Zhang Qi continued to argue.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Yu has three accounts: Dong Cheng Biao, Xing Kong Dao Ying, and Zhong Xia. Dong Cheng Biao is a powerful account with a large number of game strategy posts, and it has a strong "technical reputation". Xing Kong Dao Ying is an account that participated in the Star Lake battle and verified the strong reputation of the NPCs, gaining a huge "command reputation" among players. Zhong Xia, which was born from the original Xing Kong Dao Ying account, has gained immense "power reputation" among players through its incredible strength and the help of a godly artifact, as well as its victory in the Midnight Forest battle. The three accounts together form a formidable force, and Zhou Yu, who possesses all three accounts, is difficult to predict. On the eve of the end of the world, he sent a message that will have a significant impact on all Arthur players.
