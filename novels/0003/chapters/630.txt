Chapter 631: Battlefield Command, Unlimited Buff Machine

"Is that the person carrying a long sword?"

"No mistake, it's that man surrounded by a group of Ayan core players."

"His face is quite impressive, have you secretly detected anything?"

"Ah, I've tried, but like me, a fool like me, I've gotten nothing. I think he's applied a detection-blocking spell, and I've wasted my spell slot."

"Isn't that being too cautious?"

Players who had followed Zhao Xu to the mysterious underground cavern had arrived at a vast plaza. The powerful undead creatures seemed to have sunk to the deepest level, with not a single one popping up.

Occasionally, skeletons and zombies would roam around, but players quickly dispatched them.

At this moment, numerous players followed, and this was their first chance to observe the rumored "Zhong Xia" (仲夏).

Even the most conservative and cautious players were gazing at him with a curious expression.

However, what really piqued everyone's curiosity was the equipment he was wearing.

Although detection magic couldn't scan Zhong Xia's information, he was adorned with a golden hourglass pendant, a star-studded cloak, a gemstone-adorned headband, a water crystal suspended from his forehead, a crimson-red golden robe, and four-colored Ayn stones on his head, as well as two shining gemstones on his fingers. Just looking at his external appearance was valuable.

Of the twelve magical equipment, only two positions, the wrist armor and external shell, were missing. This had left many people wondering what each item was.
After crossing over, everyone had witnessed Zhongxia's miraculous feats several times, and they had no doubt that he was wearing all sorts of magical items. "That headband with gems, considering his identity as a mage, should be a thinking cap, but I'm not sure if it's level 2, 4, or 6."

"That belt that looks like a hemp rope should be a warrior's belt. It's strange that Zhongxia, as a mage, wouldn't feel anything and wouldn't be able to enhance his defense level by wearing this stuff."

At this moment, most of the strong players gathered in the square were all high-level players.

However, even this group of high-level players couldn't detect the number of magical items on Zhongxia's body.

Zhongxia was standing silently at the front, reviewing the contents of his mind related to the "Devil's Device".

The main thing was that he was going to take action that could lead to a riot in the entire underground dungeon, so he had to gather everyone here first.

He was mentally counting down the time difference of the Devil's Device's oscillation.

"Mr. Zhongxia, are we supposed to cooperate on something?" a cleric player asked, his tone polite but still attracting the attention of several people around Zhongxia, as if it was not suitable to disturb Zhongxia's thoughts.

Seeing this scene, the cleric player felt helpless.

Originally, he had planned to come and go quickly, but now he had wasted a day or two, and he didn't know what was happening outside. Especially in this underground dungeon, he prayed for divine intervention, but he felt a sense of suffocation and his divine magic was less than usual. If he delayed any further, he didn't know what consequences he would face.

As soon as Zhao Xu heard these words, he directly activated his flying ability and floated up. The cloak behind him was fluttering in the wind blowing through the cave. "Everyone, form a defensive formation according to the radiation pattern!" he shouted.

Finally, he flew to a high altitude, where he could only be seen by looking up. Most of the people who could gather around him had assembled here, while those further away were unable to join.

Although no one knew what Zhong Xia meant, the players below instinctively rearranged their formation according to his intentions.

At the beginning, the Arthur players wanted to fight against the powerful monsters using their formation advantages. They took the least amount of damage and delivered the strongest blows.

As they faced various situations, their formations evolved and gradually spread. By this time, they were using the most widely spread radiation formation to counter the enemies from all directions.

"Now, our top priority is to find the exit's 'teleportation portal'. So, I will use the mysterious knowledge I obtained in this cave to activate special skills. Then, the aura I spread will attract undead creatures from the direction of the teleportation portal."

"So, as long as we move towards the direction of the undead creatures, we can slowly find the location of the exit's teleportation portal."

Zhao Xu used magic to amplify his voice, covering thousands of people around him.

"Therefore, in the process to come, undead creatures will constantly emerge to attack us, and we need everyone to cooperate and block their attacks, not allowing them to breach our formation."
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu spoke with determination, "As long as I can hold out for the first few rounds, I'll leave enough time for counterattacks. I'll wipe out the strongest monsters, so everyone doesn't have to worry about being worn out."

"I'll lead the charge," he said.

Zhao Xu stood tall in mid-air, looking down at the group of players behind him.

"Alright!"

"We're with you!" the players responded, their voices filled with enthusiasm and excitement, echoing Zhao Xu's words.

Immediately, everyone made a humming noise, half-exchanging ideas and half-responding to Zhao Xu's words, with most people following his lead and allowing him to guide them.

Zhao Xu nodded in satisfaction.

It's impossible to make a plan with everyone, unless it's a vote. If a complex matter is discussed among many people, it will only lead to disagreements and make it difficult to achieve the goal.

That's why Zhao Xu didn't even consider consulting with anyone, making a decision on the spot.

As someone familiar with success seminars, he knew that it's not just about whether what you say is reasonable, but also about having a supportive crowd.

When he remained silent, he had already subtly used "hypnosis" on some players who were already on his side, making them loudly support him when the plan was announced.

However, he didn't expect that among the people who had just stepped forward, only about one-third of them had been influenced by him, and the rest were naturally in agreement with him.

His "reputation" had been established.

"That's it, let's go!"

As Zhao Xu spoke, he gazed solemnly and flew slowly to the center of the team, where the players had already formed an array, greatly reducing the original area taken up.

At this position, he could also respond to the results from all sides.

"Light Dance!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu then exhibited this zero-ring spell, and four lantern-like light circles suddenly floated in mid-air, following his will and hovering in front of him, guiding the team's direction of advance.

Meanwhile, the thousands of players below also pulled out their weapons and held up their shields, with spellcasters such as mages, priests, and druids also casting spells to buff themselves.

As Zhong Xia said, the upcoming battle was inevitable.

Due to the prolonged duration of his spells, his spells would last for 24 hours. For a 33-level spellcaster like him, spells with a 10-minute cooldown would last for 330 minutes, and with the delay factor, it would be 660 minutes, equivalent to 11 hours, making it sufficient for him to cast spells twice a day.

"Scouting network!"
A scouting spell that was unbeatable in the field of exploration!

Zhao Xu had previously used this spell when he collaborated with the "Guardian's Guild" outside Mistral City, and with a level 2 proficiency, he had boosted the 40-person party's exploration value by 80 levels.

At that time, they had crushed all the monsters in the forest area around Mistral City, and they had taken the initiative without losing a single battle.

Now, within a 6.5-meter radius, Zhao Xu easily boosted the exploration value of these players to hundreds of levels.

Suddenly, these players exclaimed in surprise, looking at their dynamic information panel and gazing up at Zhong Xia.

"I'm going, is that really true about the 80-level exploration boost mentioned on the forum?"

"It turns out that the big boss is the source?"

Zhong Xia didn't stop his pace to explain, and he continued to cast his divination spell - one-ring "Ominous Omen", two-ring "Divination", four-ring "Prediction" - to reveal the development that was about to unfold.
Here is the translation of the text:

These spells can all provide feedback with an accuracy of around 90% for their current caster level. When combined, the error is only around 1 in 1,000.

As expected, the spell feedback feels like a "prelude to a great battle" in terms of urgency.

The ominous signs indicate that "danger" is looming, and within the next hour, he will face typical challenges in his adventure: moderately challenging monsters, dangerous traps, and other risks.

However, Zhao Xu still looks concerned.

For him, everything is a danger, so what about other players?

This suggests that if other players were to cast the spell, it would be a higher-level "catastrophe".

This means that players will face severe threats, powerful enemy monsters, and even deadly traps.

The "Divination" feedback is "fortune and misfortune", which can bring both good and bad results. It seems to be saying that some people will die, but then successfully find a way out through a teleport.

The "Prophecy" spell will provide useful advice on the caster's activities, goals, or actions within the next week. The answer may be a simple phrase, a veiled riddle, or a prophecy.

At this moment, the feedback is a saying:

The spirit of fear descends from the sky, and the indestructible undead creatures will emerge from the tombs, their burning red eyes fixed on the mortal world.

Zhao Xu's eyebrows slightly furrowed, but he immediately understood that it was referring to the undead creatures without needing to ask for help from the "on-site audience".

Arthur didn't have any monsters that were truly indestructible, so this phrase is referring to the opponent's ability to revive themselves, including typical examples such as wraiths and vampires.
Here is the translation of the text:

The flame burning in the pupils is, in essence, the soul fire of the undead being, which can also emit "fear aura", making it an immortal being - a warlock. The warlock is a type of immortal being with extremely high standards and unlimited potential, with the ability to cast spells. The warlock's abilities are not something that Zhao Xu can look down upon, but the opponent's ability to cast spells makes it a battle of magic. Half an hour later, they still haven't encountered a large group of undead beings, but the team leaders of each small team are reminding their members to stay vigilant. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu has completed his detailed battle plan for fighting the warlock, thinking about whether he needs to brief the others on it. Just like when he went to deal with the old witch, Zhao Xu had prepared countermeasures for the opponent's various abilities and thought through various scenarios. So, when he charged in, he felt confident. He guaranteed that his side wouldn't be killed off in the first round. A complete battle plan is the fundamental reason why every battle mage can survive. As they move forward into the darkness, they realize that the road ahead is becoming wider, and the formation hasn't changed much. However, everyone's vigilance has not decreased, and the size of the area they are covering means that the alert system will be triggered to a certain extent. "There are monsters in the cave at the 9 o'clock direction!" Suddenly, a player in the central area, aided by the "scouting network", shouted loudly, directing everyone's attention to that direction.
In the midst of the dark void, an endless legion of "skeletons" suddenly burst forth, like a tidal wave breaching a dam, accompanied by an unstoppable force that swept towards us.

Skeletons are essentially templates, but their power is determined by the number of life dice of the monster in front of them, and their strength is limited to around level 8 at most.

After seeing the skeleton horde, everyone's anxiety began to ease slightly.

Even though we noticed that our team was still accompanied by "Giant Skeletons" and "Cloud Giant Skeletons" with killing power, they were still just ordinary skeletons, not the terrifying, indestructible undead creatures that we faced in the initial wave of the undead tide.

The skeletons in front of us suddenly clashed with the players, and although these skeleton warriors had only a ribcage skeleton, they were equipped with steel shields and curved swords, and with one swift strike, they could knock an arm off. This kind of close combat was intense enough to be seen on the streets.

Because each skeleton was fearless and played the role of a consumable item, exhausting themselves in battle.

Most players, who had not experienced street fighting or close combat with a steel pipe, would be easily defeated, and if they were careless for a moment, they would be disembowelled and see their intestines spilling out.

This is also one of the reasons why the earth suffered great losses when the undead tide first occurred.

Zhao Xu also witnessed this scene, which led him to make a solo decision.

Fortunately, players who have seen blood before are still fierce and unwavering, and without hesitation, they held their line, preventing these skeletons from advancing to the rear.

As a commander, one needs to consider not only the content of the battle but also the entire logistics and preparation before the battle.
If there's no preparation, we'll have to improvise in the heat of the moment. Zhao Xu looked at the nearly thousand players gathered together, many of whom did not have dark vision and could only rely on torches to dimly illuminate the surroundings. However, as the giant horde of skeletons surrounded them, slowly seeping into the formation of the players. The torches that were originally held high began to fall to the ground, and the players in the dense formation had little room to maneuver. Some players had even mistakenly attacked their own teammates due to the chaos and lack of visibility.

"Fat Dumpling, you stabbed me!"

"What the hell's wrong with you, can't you see I'm retreating?"

"Wait until we're done with this battle, and I'll show you what I can do!"

Several players suddenly burst into flames, cursing loudly and even using profanity. Zhao Xu could only shake his head, wondering how these people couldn't learn to keep their mouths shut in a fight. As the players began to get restless, the sky above them again echoed with Zhao Xu's loud voice.

"Warspell!"

"Vision of Allies!"

Warspell is indeed a spell suitable for war. Even though Zhao Xu had just used his latent ability to simulate the expertise of a war spell, he still couldn't help but sigh in amazement at the moment. The players who had just been shouting and cursing suddenly regained their composure.

Every player was surrounded by a green light designated by Zhao Xu's spell, allowing each player to see the green glow emanating from their teammates, even through the darkness and fog. This way, they could avoid mistakenly attacking their allies. However, in reality, there was only the faint light of the torches below. These green lights were just each person's illusion, allowing them to distinguish between friend and foe.
Here is the translation:

Just like shackles, some people are born with their hearts locked. Zhao Xu looked down at the intense scene below, but didn't take the initiative to solve the zombies, instead thinking of supporting roles.

If you want to manage, you have to cultivate your team well.

Unconsciously, Zhao Xu had already taken the personnel below as his future "subordinates".

"Warfare Magic - Battle Frenzy." --- Human Frenzied Battle Magic.
"Warfare Magic - Revival." --- Instant Medical Care for All.
"Warfare Magic - Light Wound Healing." --- Instant Recovery.
"Warfare Magic - Magical Weaponry." --- Magic Weapons for All.
...
Gradually, as the magical glow fell on the land below, the over a thousand players suddenly discovered.
How did they become braver and braver? When did these zombies become as weak as chickens?
