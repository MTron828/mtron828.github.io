Chapter 217: Inferior Players

Winter City, which is located in the Northern Alliance, has a prominent status from the very beginning. The reason why the High School Alliance, where Zhao Xu used to be, developed so rapidly is because most of its birth points are near Winter City, allowing them to benefit from the city's prosperous resources.

Winter City also has a remarkable feature: it is extremely tolerant. Even the Avariel, who live underground, can find a place to settle down without being expelled due to their skin color or faction.

Zhao Xu's entire gaming life, from the moment he started playing the game to the point where he transcended, was centered around Winter City. Even if he didn't log in for a long time, he would still carefully explore every nook and cranny of the city's most bustling "Stroll Street".

As a result, Zhao Xu felt an unusual sense of nostalgia when he saw Winter City again ten years later.

He couldn't have imagined that he would be teleported to Winter City, the city where his friends from school used to live.

What's more important is that a massive battle between players erupted at the nearby "Star Lake" within a week. Statistics show that over 90% of the players in Winter City at that time had contributed to the Star Lake's Revival Stones.

This was a justice-seeking act by the players, but it ultimately triggered a massive storm that affected the entire surrounding area of Winter City.

"Ah, friend," Zhao Xu suddenly realized that someone had lightly patted his back.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was a good thing the other party didn't exert too much effort, or they would have triggered the "Stellar Cloak" themselves. 'Hmm?' Zhao Xu turned his head around.

However, he found that he had to lower his head to see the other party.

A half-human, half-beast warrior dressed in a yellow copper-embroidered leather armor was wandering around.

'Are you calling me?' Zhao Xu asked with a questioning tone.

'Yeah, let me introduce myself. My name is Shí Yī Bǎi, and I look at you carrying such a massive scythe on your back. Do you want to sell it to me? I'll give you a high price for it,' the player said with a sly smile.

Zhao Xu looked at the "Hollow Dark" scythe on his own body, which was indeed large in size, but it seemed that the other party might have mistaken it for a refined artifact?

Zhao Xu understood that he was still overestimating, and he couldn't help but laugh out loud, 'How much do you plan to pay?'

At this moment, the pedestrians on the street all brushed past each other, and a few curious onlookers glanced at this side, but none of them lingered for too long.

'Well, I just really love this equipment, so I'll take out the market price fourfold,' Shí Yī Bǎi said with a hypnotic tone.

Zhao Xu thought he had misheard.

Could it be that the "Hollow Dark" scythe's former owner, the "Fearful Spirit" from legend, was the ancestor of this half-human, half-beast warrior?

Just as Zhao Xu was about to think of this possibility, he automatically denied it, as a player wouldn't have an ancestor.

'Look, it's nice, eighty gold coins,' Shí Yī Bǎi said with a seductive tone.

It was truly dark.

It was indeed the most free and chaotic winter city.

After hearing Shí Yī Bǎi's condescending tone, Zhao Xu couldn't help but laugh out loud.

'Yes, your eighty gold coins are worth saving up,' Zhao Xu nodded and said.

After that, Zhao Xu turned around and disappeared into the crowd.'
Here is the translation of the text:

As the half-man looked at Zhao Xiu leaving, he hastily said, "Hey, don't go! Now, who among the players has more than 100 gold coins fluttering around?"

But Zhao Xiu had already ignored him.

As Zhao Xiu truly didn't care about him, the half-man couldn't help but stomp his foot and thought to himself, "I should have added another 50 gold coins, and then I would have broken his psychological barrier. Ah, that giant scythe looks like a refined product."

"Look at that kid's expression, it doesn't seem like he knows that the equipment in his hand is actually a refined product worth 300 gold coins. Why doesn't he listen to me? This is a difference of nearly 200 gold coins."

The half-man couldn't help but shake his head.

"It's a bit strange, how is it that the scythe doesn't cast a shadow in the sunlight?"

Suddenly, his eyes widened in disbelief, looking at the front, muttering to himself, "Is it a magical weapon? Or does it have a special effect?"

"Besides that guy, who else has 8,000 gold coins?"

At this time, Zhao Xiu followed the crowd to the "General Goods Market" in Winter City.

The "General Goods Market" in Winter City was a temporary rental market, divided into paid and free sections.

In the past, Zhao Xiu, when he was a level 1 warrior, had been encouraged by his classmates to participate in a battle at the market.

After being arrested by the law enforcement officer, he had decided to work hard to level up for the next battle.

In the lower levels, whoever had a harder fist could persuade others.

As the half-man looked at the players gathered in the free section, selling items obtained from the wilderness such as animal hides and simple weapons handmade by themselves.

Even some players had been living on the poverty line for a long time, and their armor was worn out, with cotton stuffing coming out from within.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu wore a sympathetic expression and threw a few coins onto the table, buying a few empty, flat-bottomed glass bottles as containers for future medicine. If players venture out on a quest without forming a positive snowball effect, they are easily prone to financial chain breaks, followed by equipment damage and a vicious cycle of repairing equipment that cannot be fixed.

Zhao Xu then transformed this monster-hunting game into a job. As a native of a city that can be considered his birthplace, Zhao Xu naturally knew that the fastest way to gather information was to visit the local tavern.

After a while, he walked into a tavern called "Drunk Dream". Even though it was daytime, the tavern was still bustling with people, some of whom were holding a whole pitcher of wine and drinking recklessly, as if they couldn't calm their troubled minds.

Zhao Xu didn't try to approach the drunkards, not even fellow players. He quietly walked to the back kitchen and observed for a while before approaching the bartender and whispering, "Who has the most reliable information here?"

Unfortunately, the most reliable source of information in Winter City wouldn't arrive for three months, so Zhao Xu decided to rely on others. He needed to find the clues of the teleportation gates surrounding Winter City, which was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

So, he needed to borrow from someone else. This was also the influence of the strong power. The bartender, however, looked down at Zhao Xu with disdain, continuing to wipe his cup.

Zhao Xu felt awkward, unable to imagine that the bartender who would chat with him later would also have such a realistic scene. Zhao Xu then wisely slid a silver coin across the table.
Here is the translation:

Just then, the maître d' cast a flattering gaze on him, whispering, "There's a wealthy lady upstairs who's interested in you. I think you can go up and ask her a few questions."

Zhaoxu didn't hesitate, directly walking up to the room upstairs.

The maître d' looked at Zhaoxu leaving with a regretful expression, but he didn't regret it at all.

He knew that his pocket would be richer by one more gold coin soon.

The wealthy lady, Miss Wulan, was someone Zhaoxu had heard about before.

She had been connected to the Star Lake mining lords, and after just one step, she had grasped the rights to the Star Lake mines and the mining operations from Winter City's mines.

However, Winter City had long since lost all trace of Miss Wulan.

Zhaoxu soon passed the two guards' inspection and successfully entered the room.

"Do you have something to ask me?" Miss Wulan, a normal player, had somehow become incredibly powerful, controlling the fates of countless players thanks to the power of Star Lake.

"I'd like to ask for your help in gathering some information," Zhaoxu said without bowing or scraping.

Just then, other players who were friends with Miss Wulan looked over and said, "Ha, Wulan, you've got your eyes on another fresh meat?"

The group of them stared at Zhaoxu, seeming to evaluate him.

Zhaoxu felt that the people in front of him seemed to have some sort of problem.

"Yes, what's the price?" Miss Wulan suddenly looked at Zhaoxu's cloak with interest.

Zhaoxu was slightly perplexed, thinking he had stumbled into a mountain stronghold and met the Big Boss or something.

Only half a month had passed, and the social hierarchy among players had already formed?
Here is the translation of the text:

"Weren't those just props?" Wolan said to Zhao Xu as she gazed at him.

"Those are not for sale," Zhao Xu replied simply.

Zhao Xu was confused - he had come to gather information, but instead, he found himself entangled in a complicated situation. Didn't he know that gathering information required a price?

"I didn't say I wanted to buy," Zhao Xu said suddenly, his voice trembling with surprise.

Wolan's cold voice echoed from behind him, "Take it."

Zhao Xu turned around to see Wolan pulling out a bag of gold coins from her pocket and dumping it on the table. At a glance, it seemed to be worth nearly a thousand gold coins.

Even the players who were chatting with Wolan couldn't help but take a deep breath. They knew the current exchange rate between gold coins and yuan.

A thousand gold coins could buy Zhao Xu's "cape" and "giant scythe"? Zhao Xu's mind was reeling as he tried to calculate the cost.

He also began to feel a sense of discomfort. It was bad enough that he had encountered a powerful player, but now he was also entangled in a complicated situation.

"You can keep it all for yourself," Zhao Xu said, finally realizing why Wolan, who was rumored to be wealthy, had suddenly disappeared after the Star Fall Lake battle. Despite having accumulated a large sum of initial wealth, she had failed to continue her momentum, letting her influence spread throughout the entire north.

It was a ridiculous feeling.

"Hold him back," Wolan's cold voice echoed from behind him.
