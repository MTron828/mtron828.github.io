Chapter 141: My Choice

"'Your knowledge (mysterious) skill bonus is actually 4 points less than mine, and adding the 5-point bonus from reading, the gap is 9 points.' The image silently looked at Zhao Xu and said.

'I have a 19-point skill bonus, and adding the 8-point feedback from the origin, it's a total of 27 points, but I haven't passed it,'"

Generally, a player's skill bonus is calculated by adding the level of the skill and the corresponding attribute adjustment, such as knowledge corresponding to intelligence.

Zhao Xu's knowledge (mysterious) level is one level lower than the image, and the intelligence adjustment is 3 points less, so his knowledge (mysterious) bonus is 4 points less than the image, only 7 points.

After the image stacked the skills, it reached the peak of 19 points, but failed. This is also the reason why he is full of doubts and wants to try again.

'I have a spell called "Knowledge Song" that can give my skills a 5-point bonus,' Zhao Xu explained.

Suddenly, the image took a step closer to Zhao Xu, asking in a hasty tone: 'Is it all skills?'

She had immediately asked the core question.

Zhao Xu nodded, acknowledging this point.

Facing the player who would eventually become a high-level mage, there was no point in lying, as they were not ordinary people.

'I knew, I knew,' the image said, despite being extremely confident and arrogant, but couldn't help but tap their foot impatiently.

'I almost browsed through all the spellbooks at the beginning, trying to find a powerful spell in this field, but I couldn't find it. I thought it was just a fictional novel,'
As soon as the image finished speaking, it couldn't help but stare at Zhao Xu, but it couldn't bring itself to say something like "Little brother, can you teach me this spell?" in accordance with its personality.

After taking a deep breath to calm down its emotions, the image asked tentatively, "After boosting the caster's effectiveness, how many additional points of value can it add?"

Zhao Xu looked at the image with a serious expression, saying, "Initially 4 points, and each additional cast increases by 1 point."

If Zhao Xu had a 10-level caster level, this spell could boost the skill level by nearly 9 points, which would already surpass the image's advantage over Zhao Xu.

At this moment, Luo suddenly spoke up, saying, "Mr. Feng, after we leave, you can evaluate the value of this spell with the person who taught it to you. If you come to an agreement, I'll take care of the copying fee for you."

The image was about to express its gratitude, but Luo waved his hand to stop it, saying, "Don't worry, I'll just use the gold coins from that paper bag to cover it. I'll take care of it first."

Zhao Xu didn't expect that Luo and the image had become so close.

He could only think to himself, "Why don't I see a rich and beautiful mistress taking care of me?"

However, after hearing Zhao Xu's confidence, the image still handed over the "Intelligence Headband" it had been carrying.

As soon as Zhao Xu put on the "Intelligence Headband", he indeed felt a slight emotional response.

As long as he wore this thing for 24 hours, the equipped properties would take effect, and his intelligence would be considered saved.

After putting on the "Intelligence Headband", Zhao Xu immediately began to cast "The Song of Knowledge".

The casting time of "The Song of Knowledge" was a rare spell that took more than one minute to cast, but not as long as the previous "Identification" spell that took an hour.
Here is the translation of the text:

So Zhao Xuan gazed at the intricate incantations swirling in his mind, reciting them word by word.

Finally, when the spell was complete...

A strange, novel sensation emerged in Zhao Xuan's mind, not the kind of luck that would work in any situation, nor the kind of environmental assistance that would help him adjust. For Zhao Xuan, it was an extreme boost in his personal performance level. He even felt an intense sense of confidence, feeling that he would perfectly pass this trial.

Zhao Xuan's entire being was focused on the stone tablet, and his secret skill values had already increased to 15 points.

However, Zhao Xuan knew he wasn't enough.

He needed a stronger power to help him break through the current predicament.

Suddenl,y the character panel in front of Zhao Xuan's face changed, and his potential points began to surge, increasing to 2 levels.

Zhao Xuan could only acquire 5 potential points per level, which would become invalid if unused. So, before reaching level 9, he thought this ability was useless. However, the last bit of potential points was now being converted into his assistance according to Zhao Xuan's will.

Potential points are the power of heroes.

It is the power that allows heroes to unleash forces beyond the reach of ordinary people, relying on extraordinary potential.

In an instant, Zhao Xuan noticed that his secret skill values had increased from 15 to 19 points under the influence of potential points!

"Judgment!" Zhao Xuan's heart cried out.

In an instant, his consciousness began to connect with the source of knowledge.

A 20-sided die appeared in Zhao Xuan's consciousness, spinning rapidly.

The final number that fell would be the assistance Zhao Xuan could receive from the source of knowledge.
Here is the translation of the text:

The dice suddenly stopped, and the rotating steps came to a halt. A cruel "1" was directed towards the top.

Zhao Xu's mysterious knowledge skill added up to 19 points, and with the assistance of the origin's power, it was almost 20 points. However, it was far from enough to overcome the cognitive barrier of the stone monument and successfully communicate with the origin.

Zhao Xu's face turned grim, and the final communication result was still uncertain.

However, in this critical moment, he knew he had basically failed.

With a shadow of 19 points and the dice's 8 points, a total of 27 points was still insufficient to pass. Zhao Xu's 20 was no longer a concern.

In this instant, Zhao Xu gazed at the dice that had already fallen to the ground, no longer changing.

Mages can reverse their fate.

Strictly speaking, it is the magic spell that can reverse their fate.

"Immediately, cooperate!" Zhao Xu suddenly released the mysterious spell again.

This level one arcane spell only required intuitive reaction, and Zhao Xu consumed two zero-level spell slots in an instant, successfully releasing it.

Suddenly, the originally calm dice began to rotate again.

[Adventurer Zhong Xia, re-roll knowledge (mysterious) = 19 + 1D20 = 19 + 11 = 30 points, passing DC30 difficulty, successful check.]

The dice fell again, but this time the number on top was 11 points.

Zhao Xu's knowledge (mysterious) check result was 30 points, crossing the 30-layer high barrier and directly communicating with the origin.

Suddenly, mysterious symbols on the stone monument began to take shape in front of him, gradually becoming understandable content.

"This is a spell that can be used three times."
"It can either protect oneself once, rescue a soul once, or reach the other side once."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

After Zhao Xu finished speaking, a mysterious aura suddenly enveloped his entire body. He couldn't help but display a puzzled expression. Suddenly, the cracks on the stone monument spread all around, becoming denser and denser. A countless number of deathly auras began to burst out from within.

Zhao Xu immediately wanted to urge the two women to escape. However, after the stone monument exploded, a dark and evil force burst forth, mixed with the destruction and terror of death. The force erupted instantly, destroying a region of over 100 meters.

Only after the darkness dissipated did Zhao Xu regain his vision. He looked up and saw that the originally desolate cliffside had become even more barren and lifeless. The ground seemed to have been ploughed with countless furrows.

The thorny forest closest to them, covered in darkness, had the outermost thorns completely decayed and fallen to the ground.

In front of Zhao Xu, the two women had already fallen to the ground, their bodies becoming increasingly transparent. This was a sign that they were about to enter the Holy Birth Temple.

Zhao Xu quickly rushed over and saw that the two women's faces had revealed themselves after they fell to the ground. However, Zhao Xu gazed at this tragic scene and seemed to recall his past. His fists clenched tightly.

"Save one and continue forward," he said.

"Life is meant to be chosen. This is the cruel world of mages," he added.

Ling An's familiar voice echoed again, but this time it reverberated throughout the entire space.

"Naturally, you can also choose to leave the once revival opportunity and continue forward alone. In that case, you will have an additional revival opportunity in the future."

"This is the true reward of this trial," he said.

"Take action, and the next decision will determine your true fate," Ling An's voice echoed once more.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the sound of Lei An disappeared, the entire cliffside fell into a state of profound quietness, with only Zhao Xu's heavy breathing. Zhao Xu turned around, gazing at the blood-colored moon on the opposite side of the deep, profound valley.

In front of him, the stone tablet that had broken apart after the explosion was now displaying a faint, ethereal bridge above the deep chasm.

According to the contents of the tablet inscription and Lei An's words, the curse granted him three opportunities. He had already used the first to protect himself. The second opportunity was to activate the bridge to gain true power. The remaining opportunity could be used to revive one of the two girls.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and gazed at the blood-red sky, sneering, "Forget it, kids make choices, I'll save them all!" After saying that, he continuously activated the curse twice.

Two holy lights shot out directly from the markings on his arm, falling into the bodies of the two girls. The original bodies of the two girls, who were about to dissipate, reformed and solidified into physical forms.

Later, Luo and Ying slowly came to, still in a dark red world, but they were able to breathe in the air of the world again.

Zhao Xu squatted down, laughing as he gazed at the two girls, who were lying limply. At this time, Luo and Ying finally noticed that their hoods had fallen off, revealing their true faces to Zhao Xu.

Ying looked at Zhao Xu with a strange expression, then walked to the site where the stone tablet had broken apart. The remaining half of the tablet was still intact, and the true text was now displayed.

"You should go yourself," Ying whispered.
