Chapter 083: The Mysterious Treasure

After climbing onto the carriage, Luo Ya's face was still pale and lacked vitality. He had been struck by a ghostly blow the night before, and it wasn't just his life force that was affected, but also several of his attributes. In general, the residents of Arthur would suffer from attribute losses and rely on resting to recover. The speed of attribute and life force recovery was consistent, with 8 hours of rest allowing for a small recovery, and 24 hours of rest allowing for twice the recovery. People like Feng Ye had witnessed the ghostly form and had not been able to withstand the "frightening appearance" curse, suffering some attribute losses and recovering after several days of rest.

Only Luo Ya had been struck by the ghost again, and his body had not fully recovered, as if he had contracted a severe illness. The carriage compartment was not cramped, and Luo Ya sat down in an empty spot, coughed lightly, and said, "This matter was not originally in the plan, but something unexpected happened, and I received a message from the leader using the 'Telepathic Technique'."

As soon as he spoke, everyone in the carriage raised an eyebrow, and Feng Ye and others didn't know what Telepathic Technique was, but from Luo Ya's stern expression, they could tell that something was amiss.

"The leader wants us to change course and go to a secret underground city to retrieve an item and bring it to Cassius and Brutus cities," Luo Ya said. "Originally, the team's situation was supposed to avoid this kind of situation, but this matter is urgent, and the underground city is not far from here, just a half-day's journey away."

"So I want to complete the leader's commission and hope to get your help," Luo Ya said, looking down with a serious expression.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu and his four companions may not be able to defeat Luo Ya and his dozens of people in a physical fight, but in terms of individual combat strength, they are not inferior. In fact, if each of them were to fight separately, they could all rank within the top ten of this team. 

"Can we really establish contact through the Earth's underground network?"

Zhao Xu, undeterred by the unusual situation, directly asked Luo Ya.

Luo Ya nodded slightly.

Zhao Xu furrowed his brow, as there was a player beside the leader, Is, who would receive the team's information from Luo Ya and then report back to Is every day.

As a result, Is was always aware of the team's situation in real-time.

This was also the reason why Luo Ya needed to bring Is along.

However, this communication method would only be feasible if the guild arranged personnel to rotate in and out of the network regularly, otherwise, it would be limited to once or twice a day.

Even if Is was willing to wait for the designated communication time tonight, using the "Transmission Art" to contact Luo Ya would be difficult.

The Transmission Art is a five-level arcane spell in the arcane arts and a four-level divine spell in the divine arts. It is equivalent to a 9th-level spell for mages, but can be used by 7th-level clerics. However, even a 7th-level cleric would need to pay a hefty price to use this spell, unlike players who could afford it with just a few silver coins.

Zhao Xu sensed the key to the problem, but he didn't seem to be intimidated, and continued to listen to Luo Ya's explanation.

"As for the situation in the underground city, the leader will have someone report back to you tonight, and we'll set up camp outside the city. We'll wait for Mr. Maple Leaf to receive the message before entering the city to explore."
Here is the translation of the text:

"As for the compensation, the chief cannot provide detailed information due to the limitations of the transmission art, but I can promise here that Mr. Maple will double the previous compensation, and Mr. Zhongxia, upon arriving at Caso City, I will give you a satisfactory return."

Zhao Xu listened without comment.

It's not possible to mix and mingle without leaving a name, said Luo Ya, which would definitely be enough to satisfy him.

As for the people of Maple, they had already been thrilled to hear that the compensation would be doubled.

Zhao Xu shook his head at the mere mention of gold coins.

The underground city is not like the open grasslands outside. Without mentioning the traps set up inside, just the layout of the underground city could trap them in a situation where they would be forced to fight to the death.

Zhao Xu had once survived a magical trap in an underground city in his past life, but he had not sought medical treatment, and every time it rained he would experience leg pain.

After the battle that night, Maple was no longer bold enough to take the initiative, and still looked at Zhao Xu, waiting for his instructions.

"Let's go take a look first, and we'll discuss the specifics later," Zhao Xu thought for a moment before agreeing.

After lying in the carriage for a few days, they had not yet refused to listen to the situation.

In this way, Zhao Xu's carriage, with the wheels rotating and the carriage head moving forward at a slight angle, headed towards the direction of the underground city.

Zhao Xu observed the landscape outside the carriage while consulting the map.

When the three moons rose again and shrouded the entire material plane of Arthur in the night sky, Luo Ya's team also arrived at the vicinity of the underground city.

The distance from the flash flood valley on the map was still more than an hour's journey away.

Luo Ya sent someone to search around and eventually found an old, abandoned mine. According to the contents of the transmission art, the entrance to the underground city was located deep within this mine, which was extremely well-hidden.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Even if ordinary people were to stumble upon this mine, they would hardly dare to venture in without knowing what kind of undead creatures might be lurking inside. After arranging the team's campsite, Maple Leaf reconnected and brought over the message from their leader, Isis.

Zhaoxu and Luo Ya sat surrounded by a few of Luo Ya's trusted subordinates, all of whom were furrowed in concern as they listened to Maple Leaf's retelling. This underground city was information intercepted by Isis's subordinates, and it could only be tentatively judged to contain some kind of treasure. However, the specific risks involved were difficult to determine.

Furthermore, this information could not guarantee secrecy for long, and it was possible that other forces could obtain it at any moment. It was even possible that some forces had already set out to get here, which was the reason Isis wanted to notify them using "transmission magic" first.

"What are your thoughts, everyone?" Luo Ya asked, looking at Zhaoxu's group after Maple Leaf finished speaking. "Don't worry, even if you don't participate, you'll just have to wait for a day. If we don't return by then, my subordinates will continue to head to Kaso and Butan according to the original plan."

One day was the time set by Isis, after which they would have to give up exploring the treasure. Currently, the players had little experience in exploring underground cities. Maple Leaf had just searched online and found it was all unclear.

Zhaoxu, on the other hand, gazed at the dark and ominous pit, his head bowed in silence. The treasure in the underground city, which could potentially delay trade between Kaso and Butan, was definitely real, and it was undoubtedly valuable.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As soon as he got some time, he used a 4th-level spell, and the treasure wasn't worth over 10,000 GP. Zhao Xu then smashed himself with an earth stone.

The question is whether he should also go in.

Zhao Xu walked around the corner of the tent a few times, saw that the maple leaves some people looked a bit eager to move, and touched the mark on his back.

"I accept this task."

He thought to himself, recalling what Anzniya had told him before, and chose to see what kind of treasure it was.

At the same time, he thought to himself that if he got back to Kasos and Buttan City, he would use these transported goods to settle his debts.
