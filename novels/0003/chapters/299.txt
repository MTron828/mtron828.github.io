Chapter 300: Creating Undying Beings

As Zhao Xu's staff pointed towards the sky, the heavens and earth suddenly filled with the aura of death, as if the end of the world had arrived from the land of the dead. The players around felt a slight shiver of fear.

However, the 12HD life-draining beholder, a beholder hunter, barely gave Zhao Xu's spellcasting a second thought. Although Zhao Xu had just unleashed two fireballs to wipe out the summoned earth elementals, the beholder hunter didn't seem to care.

The beholder, born with exceptional physical strength, also possessed high resistance to physical and mental attacks. Its "Fortitude" saving throw, in particular, was extremely high, reaching 16 levels, which made it difficult for ordinary mages to affect it.

Now, with Zhao Xu's staff finished, the highest-level beholder hunter suddenly stiffened, and the death energy directly flooded out of its body.

Although this energy was not fire or acid and couldn't stop its regenerative abilities, it was an instant kill effect that could extinguish the life force of living targets.

At this moment, a barbarian warrior let out a loud roar, wielding his massive sword and charging towards the strongest beholder in the scene.

The warrior was consumed by a desire to strike down the beholder, and his anger drove him to unleash a fierce blow.

Just as he was about to strike the beholder, he noticed that the beholder's dodge speed had slowed down. However, before he could savor his victory, the beholder hunter suddenly stiffened and fell to the ground, as if struck by an invisible sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

The warriors surrounding the giant demon were initially stunned, their eyes fixed on the barbarian's massive sword. However, they soon noticed that everyone's gaze was focused on the wizard holding the staff. It was clear that the staff, composed of finger bones, was the one who had dominated the previous scene.

"How many HP does the giant demon hunter have?" someone asked, unable to hold back.

"At least over 100 HP," someone replied vaguely.

"It's probably over 130 HP, and it could be even higher," Snow Patrol said, putting down his bow and arrow.

"So strong, 130 HP might be enough to kill even a 10th-level warrior with a single spell," someone said.

However, no one knew that the giant demon in front of them had a whopping 130,000 HP. Even if it was not resisted, it would still die.

This was the power of the "death finger" spell.

It could directly kill living beings.

Moreover, the legendary "death spirit staff" in Zhao Xu's hand had a resistance difficulty of 34 levels. Even the "giant demon hunter" with a 16-level strong resistance could only resist the effect with a 10% chance.

If the resistance effect was not 18 levels or higher, the giant demon would be killed directly, as it did not have any spell resistance.

So, when the "giant demon hunter" fell to the ground, dead, Zhao Xu was not surprised. A normal 7th-level wizard, releasing the 7th-level "death finger" spell, would have a resistance difficulty of around 20 levels (10 + level + intelligence adjustment).
For a giant demon, this ability is essentially easy to defend against, which is also the reason why "Death's Finger" is famous but has few battle records. It's only effective against low-level monsters and can't be used to kill high-level ones.

The undead staff itself was upgraded to level 16 through "Magical Ascension" and has a 34-level difficulty in terms of evading. This is also why two energy shots are needed to cast this spell.

At this moment, another two giant demons saw their leader, a giant hunter, directly fall to the ground, and a sense of unprecedented panic rose in their hearts. For a moment, the two giant demons screamed and forgot to put on their sharp blades, and they directly abandoned their defense, rushing away in the direction they came from.

As they lived near the Mistralla region, they already knew they had messed with a powerful mage, although he only had 6 points of intelligence. However, this instinctual fear still drove them to try to escape.

The escape instinct of the giant demon tribe told them that generally, powerful mages wouldn't bother to chase after fleeing monsters. However, they encountered someone who was not a traditional powerful mage.

Zhou Xuan had once risked losing five revival stones to meet the devil-like demon "Gralzart", and even relied on his previous life's intuition to guess the other party's identity, helping the Jade Star Master solve the problem of his wife's soul. As a result, he received a generous reward from the other party, obtaining a legendary undead staff and a higher-level demon lord's scepter.

Later, Zhou Xuan obtained a fragment of the Death God's divine power, which could be used to supplement the staff's energy. With the staff, he could be extremely reckless and wouldn't waste a single day.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

As Zhao Xu gazed at the two giant demons that had been running away desperately, he couldn't help but smile disdainfully. They didn't know that staying among the players was the safest. Zhao Xu had already made up his mind to use his staff's abilities to their fullest extent, without any thought of being stingy.

It wasn't until the two giant demons were about to return to their original position that Zhao Xu directly lifted the "Death Staff" in his hand, driving the lowest-level spell, the six-ring spell, from the staff's four spells. He whispered softly, "Death Array."

【Adventurer Zhongxia, you are casting "Death Array", which can kill a total of 75 HD life value creatures (20D4 + 10D4 spell enhancement).】

Instantly, a semi-circular area with a diameter of 12 meters and an area of nearly 500 square meters, enveloped the two giant demons.

Each of the demons had only 6 HD life value, and their life force was not greater than 75 HD, and they immediately failed to withstand the spell and had their life force burn out.

The light in the giant demons' eyes lost its luster, and they directly collapsed to the ground, weighing half a ton, sending up a cloud of dust.

At the same time, in the depths of the forest ahead, three muffled landing sounds echoed consecutively.

Zhao Xu heard these sounds and couldn't help but smile, "It seems that there are still giant demons hiding in the forest, waiting to strike from behind."

However, the giant demon hunter's calculations were even deeper, but it couldn't withstand Zhao Xu's just-cast spell, which covered an area of over 500 square meters. Besides the two giant demons that had been running away, the three giant demons hidden in the forest were also enveloped by the spell and immediately killed by the group death spell.

Zhao Xu looked silently at the scene, feeling the energy feedback from killing those giant demons and the energy that seemed to flow back into himself from the heavens.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unfortunately, the "Death Array" spell can only kill creatures with 9 HD or less, otherwise it will still be a decent group killing spell. The spell kills creatures based on the total amount of life dice, such as the "Guardian" guild, which are mostly 1-2 levels and thus 1-2 HD.

Even after Zhao Xiaofei used the spell to kill a total of 5 giant demons, each with 6 HD, adding up to 30 HD, which is still 45 HD short of the 75 HD limit. He could easily kill the members of the "Guardian" guild as well.

After Zhao Xiaofei successively used the spell to kill demons that even the "Guardian" guild's players couldn't kill, the players looked at him with a mixture of admiration and fear. They even began to speculate about the identity of the master behind the mighty staff.

Meanwhile, the high-ranking members of the guild were secretly calculating how long they could survive if the spell were to be cast on them. Zhao Xiaofei then walked towards the corpse of the "Demon Hunter", and the players automatically gave him a clear area to examine his spoils.

At this moment, each player was staring at the staff in Zhao Xiaofei's hand, trying to guess its value.

However, contrary to everyone's expectations, the "Storm Wizard" did not take the spoils from the monster's corpse, but instead continued to hold up his staff.

"What's next?"
"Hasn't he died yet?"
"Be prepared!"

At this moment, the players nearest to Zhao Xiaofei were extremely cautious, raising their weapons and facing him.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the staff in Zhao Xū's hand directly emitted the aura of the dead, and suddenly the entire area seemed to be filled with undead creatures, causing both priests to furrow their brows.

Immediately, a power summoned from the realm of the dead floated out in the air and slowly merged with the fallen "Giant Hunter".

"What is summoning undead creatures?" one of the priests reacted quickly.

"Is it controlling corpses with the Four Rings, or summoning spirits with the Six Rings?" Priest Qingyun gazed at the Giant Hunter's corpse as it underwent a transformation, his eyes fixed on the dark and profound energy dancing above it, and he couldn't help but wonder.

Slowly, the Giant Hunter, which had originally been completely dead, slowly stood up, its eyes vacant as it looked around, as if it didn't know how long it had been asleep.

At this time, many people had their mouths agape, staring at the giant, three-meter-tall creature with an aura of evil emanating from its entire body.

It had a human-like physique, with skin devoid of hair, but with one notable exception: its chest cavity was hollow, with only two rows of ribs remaining.

In the middle of its chest, a small person was struggling, its lower half merged with its chest, its face pale and terrified, as if trying to escape.

This bizarre scene made the players seated in the room feel uneasy.

Even the priests who resisted the undead were silenced by this moment.

Zhao Xū was also taken aback, as he had not expected that his eight-ring "Higher Summoning of the Dead" spell would summon such an ugly creature.

Zhao Xū could only introduce it, saying, "Let me introduce you to the undead creature 'Jiāo Fén Mo', which has a challenge level of 11. It will stand at the front and clear the way for us."
