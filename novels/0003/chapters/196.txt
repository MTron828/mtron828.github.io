Chapter 197: Magical Battle

Just after casting a series of spells, Zhao Xu was mostly busy adjusting and selecting his magical abilities, with hardly any time for extra thought.

If it weren't for his experience in the Final Chapter's space-time, where he had simulated similar scenarios and gained knowledge of advanced magical techniques, he would hardly be able to distribute and arrange his spells as smoothly.

The spell "Deep Furnace Refining Demons" has an endurance of 32 levels.

However, Zhao Xu's "Treatise on the Wonders of the World" only allows him to cast spells at a level of 20.

This means that when casting spells that require magical endurance on "Deep Furnace Refining Demons", he can only succeed at a rate of 45%.

Therefore, Zhao Xu needs to consider many factors.

When he decided to become a mage, many things became difficult to handle impulsively.

Unlike his past as a warrior, he couldn't just rush in and hack his way through.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xiu felt awkward.

However, Zhou Xiu also had ways to control the transmission spell, such as the "Dimension Anchor" spell, which could prevent the target from transmitting, but the success rate was too low. Another spell, the "Dimension Lock", could block transmission within a certain area, but it had a limited coverage and could only cover an area with a radius of 7 meters. As long as the "Deep Infernal" could run to a corner, it could freely escape.

Even within the range, the opponent also had a 55% chance to resist the spell and successfully transmit.

Therefore, Zhou Xiu deliberately cast spells such as "Higher Immunity", "Element Immunity", and "Mind Shield" to give the "Deep Infernal" a surprise, at least wasting the opponent's one spell-casting action.

At this time, Zhou Xiu's "Higher Speed Explosion" spell had already consumed 6 seconds of time.

Although he had a full round of time, Zhou Xiu did not use instant spells and could only release one spell during this round, just like the "Time Stop" spell.

Zhou Xiu had just not cast his immune spell for himself, so after this round of slow-motion time was over, he would fall into a dizzy state.

But Zhou Xiu had already thought it through and didn't hesitate to cast the spell he had arranged for Lixia to change - the "Oriental Fusion" spell of the 8th-grade spellcaster!

Suddenly, Zhou Xiu's brain remembered the spell slot, and the spell began to stick together, as if they were all interconnected.
Here is the translation of the text:

The most significant effect of this spell is that it can release two prepared spells from the caster's mind after casting, with the only limitation being that one cannot exceed seven circles and the other cannot exceed four circles. It's as if the caster is using a standard action to cast two spells.

This spell is also a unique skill exclusive to mages.

At this moment, the "Book of All Spells" also wants to follow suit and simultaneously load the spell into Zhao Xu's mind.

Under the effect of this spell, the newly formed spell does not require the caster to manipulate it, and it will automatically release.

The Holy Warrior's four-circle spell - Devotion of the Martyr!

Instantly, Zhao Xu's character panel directly refreshed, with many values changing to become immune.

This spell makes Zhao Xu immune to many negative effects, including the aftereffects of "Higher Speed" and the effects of stun, psychological coercion, etc.

He also added another layer of shackles to the demon's ability.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu also realized that he had optimized one step less.

In the third and fourth rounds of time, he could have used the eight-circle spell "Spell Fusion" to automatically release a seven-circle elemental immunity and a four-circle combination of other spells, rather than simply casting a single elemental immunity.

As a result, the Devotion of the Martyr spell did not occupy the precious opportunity gained from "Higher Speed".

However, Zhao Xu had no time to regret it.

The "Book of All Spells" had already turned the page under the stimulation of the spellcasting wave, and Zhao Xu was about to give new instructions to Lakshmi.

This time, he chose to cast the seven-circle spell "Banishment".

This spell is an upgraded version of the original "Banishment" spell in Zhao Xu's defensive staff, allowing him to take out the target's loathed items, thereby increasing the success rate of piercing through the opponent's spell resistance and increasing the difficulty of spell avoidance.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's like a TV drama where someone takes glutinous rice to exorcise zombies on earth. Similarly, the holy emblem on Zhao Xun's body, the demonic book that can kill devils in his backpack, can all become his helpers. They can also be stacked, providing him with a non-negligible success rate.

Just as Zhao Xun was about to make a decision, he suddenly felt a thrill in his heart.

He immediately canceled his decision and chose the four-ring spell "Decrease Magic Resistance"!

A blue-colored light beam shot directly towards the "Deep Prison of the Devil" and then jumped onto the red scaly skin with a loud "Zhi la" sound, before disappearing into the opponent's body.

[Adventurer Zhong Xia used the "Decrease Magic Resistance" spell on the "Deep Prison of the Devil", and the opponent's magic resistance failed, and the spell took effect, reducing the magic resistance by 15 levels.]

At this moment, Zhao Xun's dynamic bar displayed the message, indicating that his spell had taken effect.

The "Deep Prison of the Devil"'s magic resistance was reduced by a full 15 levels, leaving only 17 levels. This meant that Zhao Xun's spell was basically 100% effective in breaking the opponent's resistance over the next 20 minutes.

Zhao Xun had just changed his spell on the spot because he almost forgot.

He needed to keep it a secret!

When he was in a state of time stop, he didn't continuously open four "Interdimensional Gates" and summon four "Fiery Servants of the Heavens", afraid that the opponent would see his divine artifact.

After all, he couldn't use the "Banishment Spell" to send the "Deep Prison of the Devil" back. The opponent had just witnessed him transforming into "The Book of All Spells".

Otherwise, the story of a 3rd-level human mage possessing "The Book of All Spells" would spread throughout the underworld tomorrow.
Here is the translation:

Once the colossal giant in hell's mouth received the prediction, he knew that the chosen one had appeared. Therefore, Zhao Xu changed his target spell at the critical moment and also blessed his mind, recalling the four-ring spell that could lower the opponent's spell resistance. This spell, which could reduce an opponent's spell resistance by one level for each caster level, had a maximum of 15 levels. Even at a low level, the effect was not obvious, but when the caster reached level 15, the effect became significant. In general, any ordinary being who used this spell would have their spell resistance reduced to the point where it was as weak as paper.

At the same time, this spell also required a saving throw, but its special nature would add to the difficulty of the saving throw, making it almost certain to succeed. As a result, when Zhao Xu successfully cast the spell, the time loop seemed to come to an end.

Just then, the adventurer Zhong Xia activated the "Merciful Sorrow" spell, which would immunize him against the aftereffects of the "High-Speed Explosion" and render him unconscious for a whole round. The time loop returned to normal.

Meanwhile, the deep hellish demon, sensing that something was amiss with its body, remained unaware of the spells that Zhao Xu had cast during the time loop and rapid explosion. When it approached Zhao Xu within a range of six meters, it let out a fierce roar and spat out a dark green liquid from its mouth.

However, it secretly released its "Fear Aura" at the same time. The "Deep Hellish Demon" released a flash of light, which only took an instant to do, making it impossible to defend against. Moreover, Zhao Xu thought the other was about to attack him and was preparing to cast a melee spell to counterattack.
Here's the translation of the text:

Who knew that the devil's sudden charge was only to bring the two of them within 6 meters of each other, perfectly within the range of the "Fear Aura". Under the irradiation of the "Fear Aura", once no exemption is passed, it will become like encountering the might of a dragon's aura, causing one to instantly fall into a state of fear and lose control.

At this moment, the "Deep Furnace Devil" was about to reveal its sinister smile, just about to savor the terror on the face of the man in front of it.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu was also smiling wryly at the "Devil", his face filled with a sense of understanding.

However, the "Deep Furnace Devil" did not stop observing Old Zhao Xu, who was wearing a single-layer robe and had no armor, and decided to proceed with its original combat strategy.

It opened its mouth filled with sharp teeth and spoke in an ancient, hellish tone: "Command: Intimidation!"

Zhao Xu had always thought that this kind of linguistic magic was very stylish.

For example, a level 9 spell like "Command: Death" can instantly kill the opponent.

Whether it's good or not, the main thing is that there's no complicated action involved, just a single word and the spell is cast.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also felt the constraint of the Intimidation spell on himself.

The effect of the spell was now accompanied by the sound waves, invading Zhao Xu's entire body.

[Adventurer Xia's "Higher Immunity" effect is triggered, ignoring the effect of the Intimidation spell.]

[Adventurer Xia's "Merciful Savior" effect is triggered, ignoring the effect of the Intimidation spell.]

Two consecutive messages appeared on Zhao Xu's panel.
Here is the translation:

"It doesn't matter anymore.
Zhao Xū has already gone through the cooling period and has entered a new round.
This time, he is facing the "Deep Furnace Demon" whose magical resistance has been reduced to nothing, and his magic is already 100% effective.
"'Master, if you use the same benevolent shield spell to kill it, you'll drop a crucial item,' Lakshmi suddenly prompted.
Zhao Xū thought about it and changed his strategy.
"Arcane Fusion!"
He compressed his actions again and pulled out two identical spells, followed by...
"Four-Ring Spell: 'The Hammer of Justice!'"
Immediately, the two magical energies combined to form a hammer that flew straight at the "Deep Furnace Demon".
"The Hammer of Justice!
Almost the only spell without a damage limit!"
