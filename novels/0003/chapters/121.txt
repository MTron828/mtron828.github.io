Chapter 122: Monster Compendium

Zhao Xu turned around, his eyes scanning the room, and discovered that there was only one level one mage present.

"Your turn," said Lin Qi, bumping into Zhao Xu's elbow, thinking that the soft, cushioned seat was finally his.

If it were a lecture set up by a five-ring mage, the opponent would definitely recognize the "Shining Secret Silver" badge and would definitely be fake.

However, this was actually a nine-ring mage, Noki, who, although not very old in terms of age, was still relatively young in the group of nine-ring mages.

Lin Qi, who usually lived in Mistral's house, had heard his seniors praise Noki's shape-shifting skills.

He thought that Noki had already entered the legendary mage cultivation series.

Maybe after a few hundred years, he would become a legendary mage Noki.

This young, high-level mage, who was usually a pampered child, wouldn't care about the rules or the sons of the giants. He wouldn't even dare to fart.

Just as Lin Qi was fantasizing, he noticed that Zhao Xu had stood up and was hesitating.

Zhao Xu was about to speak, but then hesitated again.

At this moment, Noki saw him and his expression changed, taking a few deep breaths before speaking slowly: "Well, since you have a thirst for knowledge, you might as well sit down and listen to the lecture."

"Now, let's begin," Noki said, walking back to the whiteboard at the front of the room, lost in thought.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, the high-level mages in the front row all turned their heads and looked at Zhao Xu, but none of them noticed anything unusual.

These high-level mages all had "Magic Constant" cast on them, which ensured the third-level "Secret Vision" magic.

If there was no obstruction, these mages would all emit a faint blue glow from their eyes, allowing them to see all magical auras within a range of 40-50 meters.

As long as it was a magical item or a sustained spell, without intentional concealment, it would be undetectable under the effect of this spell.

This was an upgraded version of the first-level spell "Detect Magic", which not only detected faster but also no longer required the caster to maintain concentration to sustain the spell's effect.

Even if they maintained their focus, they could also determine whether a living being possessed magical abilities.

As for Zhao Xu, besides the bag of Howard's Convenient Bag that could emit magical auras, there was nothing else.

Since Zhao Xu returned to the floating city, she knew that Anneth would leave a mark on the magical items she created, so she intentionally added an extra layer of concealment.

Only a few close-by high-level mages noticed the silver chip on the back of Zhao Xu's mage emblem after it was turned around, and the sharp-eyed ones immediately knew it was the "Glimmering Silver" issued by the Association, which was rarely distributed.

The silver chip also had an emblem representing three levels of achievement, but this emblem could not be read without decoding it.

However, once a golden-level chip was obtained, it would be equipped with a method to prevent magical detection, so the secret vision magic would not be able to detect it, and it could only be inspected by manual examination with the naked eye.

Even a mage like Notch, with nine rings, could obtain such a badge, and according to reason, he would not need to bother with this small fry in advance.
Here is the translation of the text:

As they thought, most of the wizards who turned their heads returned to their original posture, continuing to wait for the upcoming lecture.

Nine-ring wizards received a chip, usually with the engraving "May the magic be with you, and please assist the badge holder." This was not something ordinary nine-ring wizards could obtain.

As for the legendary "May the magic be with you, and please assist the badge holder in all matters" inscription, even the council chair, Oss, who had a nine-ring son, was not qualified to wear it.

Thinking about this, the old wizard, Zhao Xiu, looked down at his somewhat foggy glasses and smiled.

At this moment, Nico had already controlled the invisible servants responsible for assisting on the stage, starting to write the core four transformations on a whiteboard.

Zhao Xiu, who was temporarily unable to understand these, looked down and took out the book "Basic 100 Questions of Transformation Entry" he was holding, preparing to read it against.

This made Lin Qi, who had glanced at the book title, suppress a smile and almost choke on his words.

"Who can tell me why the four big transformation techniques of the core system are so hard to learn?" he asked.

At this point, Nico suddenly became stern and said, "What is it?"

After hearing this, the wizards sitting in the back row looked puzzled, thinking this was the first question of transformation.

The high-level wizards in the front row, however, looked sharp and surprised, as they didn't expect to start with such heavy content.

"What is it?" Zhao Xiu couldn't help but ask Lin Qi.

The chairs in the audience were spaced apart, making it inconvenient to whisper to each other.

If they wanted to have a private chat, these wizards would also choose to resolve it with magic, as the content of their conversation involved significant research secrets.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Because you don't recognize it, how can you change it?" Lin Qi said with a bad temper.

"Isn't there a picture or data of these biological organisms?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

He had only glanced through the monster manual before, and that was it.

Who knew that Lin Qi was looking at him with a puzzled expression, as if to say, "Can you cook a meal just by looking at a recipe?"

Those who needed to demonstrate their skills as 1-2 level novice mages had long been eliminated.

The remaining ones were mostly researchers or belonged to a certain group, and no one needed to demonstrate anything.

The fundamental question of this shape-shifting system was left in an awkward silence.

No one could answer the question, which shocked everyone.

As for Lin Qi, he had expected this, and his self-motivated teaching style was his habit.

In the audience, no one had the qualification to answer his question.

"Transforming the first principle is to deeply recognize what something is, and only then can you transform it."

"You can't ask a mage who has never seen a sprite to use 'transformation magic' to transform into a sprite. It's even difficult for him to transform into another human he has never seen."

Lin Qi continued to manipulate the invisible servant on the whiteboard, writing a few simple sentences.

"Then comes the second basic question: even if you deeply understand the biological organism you want to transform into, there is still a possibility of transformation failure. So we have been researching how to deeply understand the target biological organism."

"And after several days of research, we finally discovered a key to promoting the success rate of core four transformations."
Here is the translation of the text:

After finishing his incantation, the mysterious mage had multiple invisible servants start writing various spells on the large, five-person-high canvas. At this moment, Zhao Xiu also quickly pulled out an Arien stone and had it float above his head. He noticed that some mages had Arien stones on their heads as well, so he didn't feel much hesitation.

However, Lin Qi, who was originally attracted to the content written on the whiteboard, suddenly heard the sound of Zhao Xiu pulling out something. He turned around and saw that Zhao Xiu had pulled out a transparent, angular Arien stone.

Lin Qi's face turned sour, and he gnashed his teeth. What a shame that the equipment of the ring mage was a 36,000-gold Arien stone. People had even spent 70,000 to 80,000 gold coins to buy such an item at the auction house in the Floating City.

He had always been reluctant to spend so much money, so he could only watch his sister covet it. After Zhao Xiu cast the "reading magic" spell, he finally began to understand the meaning of the spells.

However, his intelligence was limited, and he often needed to recalculate several steps on a draft before he could arrive at the same conclusion as the experienced mages in the room. Nonetheless, Zhao Xiu was not discouraged. When they were all learning magic, everyone used to make drafts and recalculate.

As a diligent practitioner of magic, Zhao Xiu was willing to take some losses. He had enough patience to repeat the path that the original mages had taken.

"Oh no, it's meant to be like that," Lin Qi exclaimed, his eyes fixed on the whiteboard as he nodded enthusiastically. This caused the elderly mage sitting closest to him to wrinkle his brow in displeasure.

The low-level mages of this era were too sloppy, and they didn't put in the effort to lay the foundation before trying to achieve the greatest turnaround.
Here is the translation:

Lin Qi, who is normally referred to as Big Daddy by his family members, often feels inferior due to his dual body type. As a result, he has mastered the art of temporary shape-shifting and transformation, which has become his specialty.

Lin Qi's dream is to master the "Omni-Transformation" spell, which allows him to transform into any being he desires, when he reaches level 15. While there are lower-level spells that can achieve similar effects, none are as permanent and cost-effective as the Omni-Transformation spell.

"Wow, it's too amazing!" Lin Qi exclaimed to Zhao Xu, who was completely absorbed in the whiteboard, not uttering a word. The language they were using was actually a deconstructed model of the spell, which only those who had mastered the art could understand.

This was also the reason Lin Qi wanted to get rid of people who hadn't learned these spells. Zhao Xu, who hadn't learned these spells, looked puzzled and asked, "Don't you understand?"

Zhao Xu's lack of knowledge about the spells made him completely lost, and he asked Lin Qi for an explanation. "Hmm, take a look at the third-level structural analysis below the soup-style structure. That's the core of the transformation spell, which has solved a long-standing question that has puzzled us for a long time."

"What?" Zhao Xu looked puzzled.

After Lin Qi finished speaking, he finally opened his mouth again, saying, "As we've just said, if you don't have a deep understanding, it's basically impossible to transform into the target being."
Here is the translation:

"Even though there are precedents for successfully transforming into a target species despite not fully understanding it, it is still impossible to replicate them."

As he said this, Fat Lin Qi was about to unleash a powerful attack, shocking the foolish young man in front of him.

"Now, in the way of 'thorough understanding,' there may be another route that allows us to avoid the long-term method of getting to know each other."

"So, it's likely that Floating City will mobilize a large number of people to tackle this difficult problem."

As Fat Lin Qi spoke, Zhao Xu became deeply puzzled.

Why didn't anyone tell him that you need to thoroughly understand the target species before choosing a transformation form?

Before he transformed into a Celestial God Servant, he had only glanced at the monster manual.

"Mr. Lin Qi, aside from long-term companionship, what other ways are there for 'thorough understanding'?" Zhao Xu asked, puzzled.

Fat Lin Qi, immersed in the content on the whiteboard, replied impatiently, "The answer is in the book in your hand, Question 87. It's about the 17 special cases of thorough understanding and the examples that cannot be replicated."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu quickly flipped through the book in his hand to the page mentioned by Fat Lin Qi.

"Special Case 13: Through reading the monster manual. The process of reading is considered a link to achieve thorough understanding with the target species, with a success rate of over 90% when transforming into the target species."

At this point, Zhao Xu recalled Anniya intentionally walking over to the bookshelf, selecting a book to hand to him.

However, this 100-question book did not explain what the "monster manual" is.

Zhao Xu could only continue asking Fat Lin Qi, "Mr. Lin Qi, do you know what the 'monster manual' is?"

Fat Lin Qi's eyebrows moved, and he immediately said, "You're still fantasizing about this thing?"
According to legend, this book of "Monster Compendium" is said to be a divine artifact from the higher gods, and all living beings that appear in the world will automatically be recorded in it. Its creator is King Ernest of Ofa, but since his mysterious disappearance, the "Monster Compendium" has also disappeared, and everyone suspects it is hidden in King Ernest's secret chamber.

Zhou Xu suddenly felt that the "Monster Compendium" placed in his dorm room was a bit too hot to handle.
