Chapter 510: Comprehensive Strengthening, Falling Giant Dragon

As the night wore on to around 3-4 am, most people would easily fall asleep, and when they woke up, it would be around noon the next day. However, Zhao Xu was full of energy, with a stone removed from his heart. He put on a down jacket and walked silently to the balcony, gazing at the cityscape at night.

If he lit another cigarette, it would be as lonely as snow. However, Zhao Xu's generation didn't care much about smoking. After crossing over, the only person he had contact with was his father, who had brought him some native tobacco from Arthur.

The conversation between Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei in the phone call was still replaying in his mind, accompanied by the gentle evening breeze.

With the residual energy from the two worlds, Zhao Xu's cognitive abilities, which were already high, had become even more formidable. He quickly reviewed the conversation from start to finish, thinking to himself about his decision-making.

Regardless, after venting to Wang Qingwei, Zhao Xu felt that his mental burden had decreased by half.

Zhao Xu had touched the mysterious underground tunnel in the floating city, which connected to the energy channel of the Earth.

As players passed through it, they were projected into Arthur. With the information he obtained at the time, he was clear about the load capacity of this device.

This claim had also been verified by Anniya.

Combining this with the fact that Zhao Xu had caused all players in Arthur to disconnect for more than a day,
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he opened this Pandora's box, he might just bring about another "disconnection" in the channel. On the eve of crossing over, even if everyone on Earth believed his words, he deliberately bought an account, which granted him 28 points of talent. However, the number of people who could smoothly enter the channel was limited. Once he used his "prophecy" as a trump card, it would inevitably set off a massive snowball effect that could not be stopped. Therefore, Zhao Xu could only wait until the last day to release it. By then, it would be too late for him to turn back, and he had intentionally discussed with Wang Qingwei the night before. On the other side of the moonlit night, a girl was also gazing longingly at the land that was about to be left behind. ...

When Zhao Xu relogged the next day, he was arranged by Anziniya to smoothly enter the North Branch of the Mage Association, completed the identity verification, and selected a set of architectural plans for the Mage Association. He then returned to wait for the logistics to be ready before starting work. From then on, his priority would be building the Mage Association. As for him driving a carriage being chased by winter wolves and then disappearing in the ice gorge, the treasure of the six sisters being lost, and the six sisters themselves disappearing without a trace, it was as if a deep fog had been piled up, with no one inquiring or investigating. Even a 10th-level strong warrior like Arthur could decide the key personnel and important choices for a region, let alone some historical nodes. However, the legendary strong individuals hiding behind the curtain would naturally use a different set of rules. Meanwhile, the hostages held by the six sisters were also rescued smoothly through the intervention of the Sacred Guardian Knights.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The incident was temporarily brought to a close.

However, it was well-known that the aftershocks would only be hidden for the time being.

Although Zhao Xu did not publicly claim responsibility for saving Flore and Lady Ailith, he still fulfilled his initial agreement and granted the lordship of the Starfall Town to Zhao Xu.

At this time, Zhao Xu, along with Annie, Vivi, and White Dragon Serus, were all crammed into a carriage, returning home.

The responsibility of driving the carriage was also transferred to White Dragon Serus.

Over the next few days, Zhao Xu sat in the carriage, flipping through the "Property Manual" one by one.

These mysterious and powerful "Property Manuals" contained unique magical scripts, filled with magical energy.

To gain the ultimate power through reading, it was necessary to read the entire book for 12 hours straight. Moreover, it was not allowed to read the book in one sitting, but rather had to spread it out over six days or more.

As the carriage traveled steadily for six days and approached the destination, Starfall Town, Zhao Xu finally obtained the additional 25 points of property.

Incidentally, Zhao Xu's property points also directly increased his intelligence after reaching level 8, bringing his current property values to a new level.

Strength: 43 (+16) = 8 initial + 24 unknown (Extinction Domain) + 6 enhanced (Divine Power) + 5 internal
Agility: 18 (+4) = 13 initial + 5 internal
Constitution: 17 (+3) = 14 initial - 2 death contract + 5 internal
Intelligence: 29 (+9) = 16 initial + 2 points + 6 enhanced (equipment) + 5 internal
Perception: 19 (+4) = 14 initial + 5 internal
Here is the translation of the text:

Charisma: 18 (+4) = 13 (initial) + 5 (inherent)

At this moment, Zhao Xu is looking at his attribute table, which is full of strong and impressive numbers.

This game allows players to feel the sense of gameplay through these specific numbers.

For players, the most intuitive comparison is the size comparison of these numbers and the total cost of equipment.

Although the strength of a mage's spells is determined by intelligence, the number of spell slots is still determined by perception. Therefore, after Zhao Xu's perception reached a new high, his spell slots have been refreshed:

【Arcane (Mage)：
Zero Circle: 4 = 4 (profession)
First Circle: 7 = 4 (profession) + 3 (intelligence)
Second Circle: 5 = 3 (profession) + 2 (intelligence)
Third Circle: 5 = 3 (profession) + 2 (intelligence)
Fourth Circle: 4 = 2 (profession) + 2 (intelligence】

【Divine (Cleric)：
Zero Circle: 4 = 4 (profession)
First Circle: 5 = 4 (profession) + 1 (perception)
Second Circle: 5 = 4 (profession) + 1 (perception)
Third Circle: 4 = 3 (profession) + 1 (perception)
Fourth Circle: 3 = 2 (profession) + 1 (perception】

【Divine (Paladin)：
Zero Circle: 3 = 3 (profession)
First Circle: 2 + 1 (domain) = 1 (profession) + 1 (perception) + 1 (domain】

Currently, Zhao Xu has 7 fourth-circle spells, and he can combine 9 third-circle spells to form 4 fourth-circle spells, plus the 3 recoverable spell slots of the Sage's Robe. In total, he has 14 fourth-circle spells.

With this, he has broken free from his initial predicament of having only 5 fourth-circle arcane spells.
After obtaining the four-ring divine art, Zhao Xu also rightfully returned the staff that can manipulate the domain of eternal darkness to Anniya.

From now on, Zhao Xu will prepare his magic every morning, and his sole focus will be on mastering the "Domain of Eternal Darkness" four-ring divine art, which can increase his magic level by half.

This skill is crucial to his combat capabilities, and its level depends on the specific level at the time of casting. Although it may only last for 6 seconds, it is sufficient, as the half-level increase in magic level can be maintained for 24 hours through the magic.

This is also the reason why Anniya can grant him a magic level of 70+.

At the moment the sun rises, White Dragon Serus, who is standing beside him, looks bewildered as Zhao Xu unleashes a combination of moves. Zhao Xu's own magic level is 7, and with the addition of 1-level tattoos, rituals, and Aen stones, it reaches a total of 10 levels.

After activating the 2-ring magic, "Meat Sacrifice", he reaches 15 levels.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu activates the magical beads on his necklace, which increases his level by 4.

Next, he activates the Arsenic Cross, consuming an X-ring magic slot and increasing the next X-ring magic by 4 levels.

Finally, when Zhao Xu casts the "Domain of Eternal Darkness" with the skull-shaped death seal (Death Magic +1 level), his own magic level at that moment has reached 24 levels.

In other words, the magic can give him an additional 12-level increase in magic level and 24 points of unknown power.

After 10 minutes of continuous morning buffing, his magic level becomes 31. Even after the magical beads' power disappears, he still has a total of 27+12=39 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

The hour-level spell in front of him, combined with the expertise in delaying, can last for two days. The 10-minute-level spell can also last for 9-10 hours, and can be used as a morning buff.

As for the experience of using the blessing of the priest's magic after going out, it is not considered. Except for the sixth-grade virtues of the right qi, he cannot use it. The remaining virtues and fourth-grade divine power are all worn without hesitation.

The first-grade virtue increased Zhao's attack and damage by 3 levels of luck. The fourth-grade divine power increased his attack from the original 5th level to the equivalent of the character's level, which is the 8th level. At the same time, it also brought 6 points of strength enhancement and temporary life value.

In addition, Zhao used the "Higher Magic Weapon" given by the third-grade "Higher Magic" to enhance the power of the staff, increasing the attack from +2 to +5 (after 62 hours of delay).

Zhao's current attack level is 31 levels, consisting of 8 levels of strength, 3 levels of luck (blessing), 5 levels of strength enhancement (weapon), and 16 levels of strength, minus 2 levels of weakness (defect) + 1 level of speed.

At this point, Zhao's attack power is comparable to that of some warriors who have not yet reached the legendary level.

He finished his morning buff in less than a minute and caught up with countless warriors who had spent their entire life trying to achieve this.

At this moment, the group of people were just getting up and tidying up their belongings. White Dragon Serus was standing in the corner, looking at Zhao, who had just finished his morning buff. He couldn't help but snort, "You humans are relying on the power of magic weapons, but you can't catch up to us dragons in terms of raw power."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Are you kidding me? This wooden stick is already leveled up to your spellcaster's level, and you're asking how far it can be stacked?" He glanced at Anzuo Noya, who didn't even look up, and finally gained the courage to speak up.

Anzuo Noya, who was sitting beside him, smiled lightly and continued to prepare for the day with the warm water.

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but laugh.

Since leaving the city of Auror, this white dragon had become more and more insolent. At first, it protested that driving every day was too tiring and demanded an increase in compensation. And now, it dared to scold him like this.

The "Magical Weapon" spell could only provide a one-level enhancement, which Zhao Xu had already used to make Maple Leaf's weapon magical, allowing it to attack the undead.

The "High-Level Magical Weapon" spell, on the other hand, was a stronger version. This spell could provide a one-level enhancement every four levels, so theoretically, a 20-level mage could turn his wooden stick into a +5 magical weapon that could last for 20 hours.

However, Zhao Xu, who was only 8 levels away, could already achieve the +5 level enhancement and even extend the duration to two and a half days, needing to reapply the spell only once every three days.

As he looked at the white dragon's provocation, he stood up and looked at the temporary cave he had found the night before, sizing up the space. He then said, "Not willing to try? Come on!"

After reading the "Fitness Manual" for the sixth day, Zhao Xu's physical condition, which had weakened due to the "Death Pact" spell, had recovered, and he could even see the bulging calf muscles under his bare skin.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mighty and diverse magic allows Zhao Xu to excel in playing nearly all professions. "Come on, come on," the white dragon, Serus, sees Zhao Xu hooking up and can't help but smile with joy.

As a dragon tribe, they are naturally inclined to attack with their claws. Humans, unless they are warriors like monks who practice "empty-handed" combat, find it difficult to attack with their hands and are often at a disadvantage with -4 levels of attack.

"However, we dragons do not engage in battles without a head start," Serus says directly, removing his upper body and challenging Zhao Xu with a smirk.

"Hmph," Zhao Xu says with a slight smile, "isn't that just a show?"

"Alright, whoever loses will follow the winner's orders for ten years," Serus says.

The moment Serus hears this, he bursts into laughter, thinking that ten years is a relatively short period for a dragon's lifespan. He has already begun planning to use this period to trade with that terrifying Ana Sofia.

At this moment, Zhao Xu is still unaware of the turmoil that will erupt around him in the next month, which is equivalent to the battles he would encounter in a hundred years.

Serus can't help but say, "Hurry up, hurry up, let's get started?"

"Okay," Zhao Xu says nonchalantly.

Serus is eager to prolong the work period, and this is his first time hearing it.

In an instant, Serus lets out a sharp cry and then releases the restrictions on his transformation magic, transforming into his original, enormous white dragon form right then and there.

The previously empty cave is suddenly occupied by this massive dragon.

Meanwhile, Saint Warrior Vivianna looks at Serus with a dazed expression, thinking that it's not easy for someone with his intelligence to come up with such a clever plan.
After recovering its original form, the white dragon, with its strength and physicality restored to its prime, became incredibly ferocious.

It sneered at Zhao Xuan, who had approached it, and shouted:

"I'm two levels larger than you in terms of body size. You can't even touch me, let alone defeat me. You can use your giant transformation spell to increase your size by one level, but within the range where you can still be defeated, I'll engage you in a battle of strength."

Sirus, the white dragon, was indeed an outstanding mage. However, he had firmly decided to educate his future offspring on a principle.

When a mage gives up their magical abilities and chooses to engage in a physical fight with a great dragon, it's definitely a recipe for disaster.

Sirus felt that this sentence was exquisite and decided to write it into "The Chronicles of the Eternal White Dragon: Sirus's Testament".

If we simply compare strength, the mage might still have some tricks up their sleeve. However, in a true battle between men, it's all about "grappling" and "takedown".

This is the clash of flesh against flesh.

Takedown refers to the level of close combat and attack proficiency between the two parties, which is influenced by both individual skills and the ferocity of their physical strength.

However, as a four-legged dragon, Sirus had a four-level advantage in stability and, with each additional level of size increase, he gained an additional four-level advantage.

This was the key to his victory over his opponent.

Unbeknownst to Sirus, Zhao Xuan was also sprinting towards him, almost too fast for the dragon to see. Zhao Xuan had completed his spell, and his entire body had grown by one level, resembling a small giant.

In the next instant, Zhao Xuan found himself in Sirus's incredulous gaze.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu, who had grown taller, easily lifted up a gigantic white dragon, just like a puffed-up doll.

Subsequently, Zhao Xu slammed it down to the ground with all his might.

Smoke swirled, spreading everywhere.

The gigantic white dragon, after enduring the pain, shamefacedly burst into tears.
