Chapter 257: The Winter of Boilfont

A warrior from Starfall Lake, grasping his massive sword with all his might, plunged it deep into the body of the priest player in front of him.

The powerful penetrating damage directly caused the opponent's life force to drain away, leaving him dead on the ground.

After half a day of intense battle, the warrior could smell the acrid stench of the battlefield, far removed from the acrid smoke.

The player ahead would soon disappear due to projection reasons.

As for the Mining Association, it seemed they had no intention of dealing with such matters.

As a mid-level official of Starfall Lake, he couldn't stop this from happening, even if it meant he fell ill or even died. He could only continue to wield his sword.

After completing this attack, the team leader of the watch continued to hold his sword at the ready, gazing out at the impending attack. However, he noticed that a blanket of snowflakes had fallen on his sword.

The snowflakes were immediately dissolved by the warm blood on the sword's surface, transforming into snowwater.

As the warrior gazed up at the sky, he couldn't help but lift his head and gaze at the sky.

"This isn't autumn yet? How can it snow three months early?"

Slowly, he began to feel the cold wind blowing towards him, like a frost on his face, causing a slight pain on his cheeks.

At this moment, both sides of the battlefield began to feel this unusual phenomenon.

"Is there a mage using a blizzard-type spell?" a novice mage asked.

However, the people around him shook their heads and pointed further away.

On the battlefield in front of Starfall Lake, flakes of snow continued to fall relentlessly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Currently, all players have mastered spells within a radius of ten to twenty meters, which is equivalent to the size of a small classroom. However, the current scene is a winter wonderland, with the original scorching sun hidden from view. The entire world has been enveloped in a silver-gray shroud, entering a harsh winter.

Innumerable people couldn't help but lift their heads to gaze at the sky, which was once a bright blue but has turned pale and white with snowflakes dotting it. Even under the intense cold wind, it's impossible to gaze directly.

"It seems that winter has arrived prematurely," a traveler exclaimed.

"Could it be related to the god's war?" Zhang Qi muttered to himself after hearing this.

Since the 4th-level mage appeared, the enemy's main force has been led away by the opponent, and they have quickly merged with another main force.

Notably, everyone was struck by the sudden appearance of the "Magic Goddess Temple" and the reaction to its effects. Many people recalled the scene where the goddess appeared in their dream last night, wearing the Magic Goddess's holy symbol.

As the news spread quickly through the entire Star Lake battlefield, many players had seen the goddess's appearance in a post.

At this moment, the sudden appearance of snow and the howling cold wind further confirmed the unusual nature of today.

Zhang Qi, the priest, was well aware of this.

The weather in the Arthurian world doesn't have sudden and drastic changes, especially those that affect the entire world. It's possible that a god's war is brewing behind the scenes.

Suddenly, Zhang Qi felt that the arrows and spears flying through the air were quite meaningless.
Here is the translation of the text:

They are fighting to the death here, and the effect they are unleashing may be as powerful as the will of a deity. However, it's only now that both sides have exhausted their strength and are rushing to send more troops to the battlefield to force the enemy to surrender.

Even from the perspective of the high-ranking officials of the great guilds, they would not rest until they have killed every single gold miner in the entire Star Lake town. "At least this snow has come, and there won't be an outbreak of plague for the next two days," Cui Lu said, gazing at the scene before her.

The unburied corpses scattered across the battlefield, amidst the blazing flames and scorching heat, are breeding grounds for the spread of infectious diseases, as East City's Lin had mentioned earlier. Now, with the addition of this thick layer of snow, the rate of decomposition has slowed down, and the flames have died down, leaving the ground scorched and barren.

This has also made it easier for the players to gather and launch a counterattack. Moreover, the snowstorm has severely limited the enemy's long-range archers' line of sight, reducing the density of arrows fired on the battlefield by more than half over the past ten minutes.

As everyone gradually comes to realize the effects of the snowstorm, they can't help but think of the divine intervention that has taken place. "Is that a high-ranking priest who's so powerful that he's even called upon divine aid?" a warrior exclaimed, his body clad only in a thick leather armor, with snowflakes falling into his neckline, but feeling no coldness whatsoever, only warmth in his heart.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the apprentice of the mage failed to summon the gods, he was aware that no matter what spell he used, he couldn't bring about the summoning of the gods or change the weather of King Arthur's kingdom. It was as futile as trying to hold back a swarm of mosquitoes with a cannon. On the battlefield, the priestesses of the magic goddess were praying and expressing gratitude to the divine for their blessings. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had released a 9th-level spell, was silently feeling the changes in the weather of the region.

"Your thinking is too complex, Master," Laksis suddenly exclaimed in surprise, as she had originally suggested that Zhao Xu find a way for players to avoid the upcoming plague. However, Zhao Xu had unexpectedly taken into account the suppression of battlefield smoke and archer fire and directly used the 9th-level spell "Fimbulfizz's Winter" to alter the weather in a region.

However, Zhao Xu was not a divine being, and after releasing the spell, he found he couldn't control its intensity. At this moment, he was staring at his dynamic panel.

The people present only knew the duration and scope of this winter at this moment.

The adventurer, Zhongxia, had cast "Fimbulfizz's Winter", with the following effects:

* Range: within a 50km radius
* Duration: 4 months (4D12 weeks)
* Intensity: extremely cold, with heavy snowfall and continuous snowfall
* Snow depth: 0.6 meters
* Wind speed: 34 km/h

Zhao Xu looked at the specific effects and suddenly felt a headache coming on. He had forgotten that, from the perspective of the solar term, the Northern Alliance had just entered winter, and it was usually two months before the heavy snow arrived. As a result, the intensity of the spell resonated directly with it, and if it were summer, it would only be a light snow or hail. Moreover, the affected area was estimated to be the size of a small city, still within the controllable range.
Here is the translation:

Even he had to be grateful for the duration of the spell's effect being within the normal fluctuation range. Otherwise, if it were the extreme 48-week limit, the "Star Lake" and "Winter City" could be seen with snow all year round. Naturally, the crops in this region would also be ruined. Unless another ninth-level priest intervened, using "Miracle Technique" or the like to terminate this effect. "The Winter of Finburi" is a highly optimized spell, equivalent to achieving the feat of "moving mountains with a mere thought", and it's capable of forcefully pulling a large area into winter. After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu remained silent, deep in thought, contemplating his next move. Following his previous spellcasting, both sides had to withdraw, regroup, and prepare for a new battle in the snow. This was also intended by Zhao Xu to give players time to regroup and revive their allies at the new temple. Suddenly, he gazed at Zhang Qi on the other side. He noticed a familiar player from the future, who was heading towards Cui Lu, having just left "Wooden Nunn" from the First Mage of Winter City. Zhao Xu directly skipped the 10-minute spellcasting time, simulating a third-ring "Sharp Ear Technique" with his divine sense, setting up a magical detection array around Cui Lu from hundreds of meters away. At this moment, he had already sensed what Cui Lu would receive next. And this was what he needed to know and intervene with. The player responsible for liaison from the Grand Alliance walked up to Cui Lu, unaware that they were already surrounded by the listening spell.
He directly whispered to Cui Lu: "Ms. Cui Lu Xunlin, hello. The 'Resistance Alliance' has decided to take this opportunity to regroup, and then hold an emergency meeting in 10 minutes. The group number is XXX. Please join the meeting immediately." After saying this, the player immediately went to inform the next person according to his own arrangements.

After listening to this, Zhao Xu also withdrew the magic induction field. In this battlefield, the battle of the Fallen Star Lake in the previous life was fought loosely, mainly because there was no one who could dominate everything, and there were no fewer than a hundred participating forces, which could not be completely integrated.

Now, under his interference and urging, the entire battle plan still had to rely on several prestigious players to gather the decision makers of various small organizations, and then half discuss and half arrange, distributing their respective task areas.

Zhao Xu had a covert mission yesterday, so he did not attend the early morning operation meeting held in the Q group last night. Now, he had to go to the group and voice his opinion.

In Zhao Xu's mind, he immediately reviewed the entire battle of Fallen Star Lake from beginning to end. Combined with the battle experience he obtained from the "Blazing Heavenly Servant," he continuously repaired the framework in his smarter state at this moment.

"Log off." Zhao Xu silently issued the command, while the group number was spinning in his mind.
