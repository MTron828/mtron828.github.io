Chapter 142 Testing Harvest
At the top of the central tower of the real illusion, the walls made of red bricks were hung with floating projections, showing the real scene of the entire Forest of Deception.
The perspective of the projection is diverse, as if there are pairs of eyes scattered in different positions in the void.
Looking closely at those images, it will be found that more than half of them are centered around the already shattered stele.
"Vice President, the voices you just created didn't make sense, did they?" When Leian and others reached the fractured canyon, they had already retreated to the second line and did not intervene in the manipulation of the later scenes.
Therefore, the voices that Zhao Xu heard after Lu (Wang Ningwei) and Ying (Aisweixi) were killed by the Black Light Curse were not emitted by Leian.
"As outsiders, we can often observe others with a god-like mentality. However, for those in the game, especially in the situation where they will officially dissipate and die in a few more seconds, they will also be more tormented by mental anguish."
The vice president of the Mage Association, Anger Wind, looked at Zhao Xu in the projection and said, his expression had softened a lot since just now.
At this point, Leian couldn't help but think deeply.
He knew that Anger Wind was not simply testing whether Zhao Xu would save someone.
In the curse on the stele, after using up one chance to protect himself, Zhao Xu had two chances left to save someone, and then to materialize the elusive floating bridge, and then the two survivors would pass together.
The person who was not chosen to be revived would naturally be revived by Leian, but the other person would also lose the opportunity to continue.
This test is a mutual screening, a mutual proof of one's abilities. The strongest can choose the most valuable teammates, which is the cruel truth explained by the monument. Only Zhao Xu chose to refuse to move forward, using both spells to save people. This choice has been made by others before, but it will never reach the point of moving the vice president. Lei An knows that there is definitely something deeper, but he hasn't been able to figure it out yet. "That's it." After Vice President Nufeng finished speaking, he immediately teleported away. When Zhao Xu revealed that he was already a level 3 mage, Wang Ningwei and Aisweishi were somewhat surprised. In fact, even Zhao Xu himself didn't understand what had happened. He only knew that on his character card, his character level had now become level 3. This means that after he completes some remaining promotion conditions, he will be a genuine level 3 mage, as well as a level 1 priest and a level 2 scroll scholar. Just like when he met the mage Lai En at the bottom of the mine, he leveled up on the spot and directly met all the conditions to become a level 2 character. "Are you saying that in this recent adventure, you leveled up to level 3?" Aisweishi asked Zhao Xu with a certain degree of consideration. At this time, there was still a faint smell of decay in the air at the edge of the cliff, the aftermath of the death black light explosion. But Zhao Xu could feel the abundant power of his body after leveling up, including his potential points being restored to full. More importantly, from now on, he can go and learn second circle spells. The door to the second circle spells in the new world has finally opened to him.
Here is the translation of the text:

"However, let's get to the point, why do you want to save us? Or, if you're going to save us, wouldn't it be enough to just revive our teacher? She's the one who's rich in resources and can be a great help."

Esvezi asked jokingly.

Wang Congwei looked at the two of them with a smile on her face, but didn't say much.

For her, it was already enough to be able to live on.

Even Zhao Xu's becoming a 3rd-level mage was a small matter.

After Esvezi asked his question, Zhao Xu fell silent for a moment before saying, "I didn't think too much, I just didn't want to see life slipping away in front of me."

"I refuse to choose to sacrifice others," Zhao Xu explained.

He's not great, but some things are just unnecessary.

He wants to go to the top and revive, and he'll earn it himself.

He doesn't need to use the death of the two girls as a trade-off to get another revival or two.

"Consider it a debt," Esvezi said softly.

Suddenly, the sky, which was originally red, began to change, like a dark red canvas being splashed with vibrant colors. The sky slowly tore open, piece by piece.

The earth also began to shake, and the dry and cracked ground slowly filled in the gaps.

Next, a sharp light beam came down from the sky, breaking the silence of the deep space.

Zhao Xu was stunned, and after the light passed, he opened his eyes again.

In front of him was a quiet and peaceful classroom, with translucent curtains outside, and a serene and peaceful view of the floating city.

The sunbeams fell on them, like a new birth.

"This virtual reality effect is quite realistic, isn't it?" Ra'an sat on a hand-carved recliner, indicating that the three of them should sit down.

"Congratulations, you have temporarily passed this test," Ra'an said with a smile after the three of them sat down in front of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is the next stage unnecessary?" Wang Congwei asked with a question.

Zhou Xu and Esvi also looked at Le'an with the same expression.

The three of them were clear that this test was just the opening act of the story, and that there must be more to explore beyond the Blood Moon.

"Actually, you've taken the wrong path," Le'an explained awkwardly.

"This is called 'The Secret Box of the Witch' and it's a long test field. However, the difficulty level is too high and not suitable for you now. So, the original intention of the test was to get you to the location where you can find a secret door, where you can find the target I want you to find."

"The Broken Stele is the content of the latter test. I didn't expect that you, a group of newbies, could also accumulate enough knowledge and skills to decipher the content of the stele. You really deserve to be called a top player in the player community."

At this point, Le'an noticed that Zhou Xu had become a 3-star character, and his smile also had a hint of incredulity.

The three of them were somewhat bewildered, thinking that they had finished exploring and were about to return to the teleportation platform. But who could have expected this situation?

However, they had to find a way to cross the cliff, so they would have to go back and find clues. At that time, the secret door would also be found.

But they had unexpectedly accumulated 19+ skills, directly spoiling the entire plot.

"That's it, we don't need to test anymore? What about the rewards?" Esvi asked practically.

"There are still stage rewards," Le'an suddenly felt he was facing a formidable opponent.
"As for the subsequent tests, we'll have to wait until all of you reach level 3. I promise, the things in the witch's secret treasure chest will be very useful even in the later stages."

"In fact, this real illusion has many such test copies, and except for abilities, most of the physical items you find can be used in reality. So being able to reach the eighth level is a reward in itself."

"However, this copy has progress locking, so when you all reach level 3 next time, you'll have to come together to open it," explained Lei An with a sly smile.

"Hmph, finally admitting that those three mages were fake? Hehe, I won't come next time to such a creepy scene," said Aisvixi firmly.

Wang Ningwei said, "I agree with Zhongxia and Aisvixi."

Zhao Xu didn't expect Aisvixi to be so righteous, but thinking of the other's hoarding nature, as long as she didn't say it was really good, it would be fine.

"I'm also very busy, let's get to the point and teach you the ability of 'concealed casting'," Lei An urged.

He only knew half of the true secrets behind the witch's treasure chest, and whether anyone had ever cleared this illusion open to low-level mages was unknown.

Lei An then began to explain the origins and techniques of 'concealed casting' to Zhao Xu and the others in the not-so-spacious classroom. But when they heard the specific content, even Zhao Xu and the two women, who had always been carefree, couldn't help but frown.

The simplest way for mages to obtain information in a head-on confrontation is naturally the ability to "identify spells".

Only by knowing the opponent's spells can one respond calmly.

And the premise of spell identification is hearing the opponent's incantations and seeing the opponent's casting movements.
Here is the translation:

Even if you don't recognize the opponent's magic, you can still obtain the feedback from the magic source through the skill of "Magic Identification" and know what kind of magic the opponent is using.

However, acquiring the skill of "Deception Magic" requires meeting several prerequisites. The focus level must be level 1, the Magic Identification level must be level 1, and the hand skill must be level 5.

As for Zhao Xuan, he has already reached level 5 in the first two skills, but he is still struggling to reach level 5 in the hand skill. This skill is the simplest way to show off by hiding a coin in his hand. For high-level thieves, this skill is a must-have.

As for street performers who perform magic on the street, most of them have this hand skill at a level or two. Those who aspire to become master thieves will also strive to improve this skill.

Although players and residents of the city disdain the act of theft, in some extreme tasks, having a thief with a high-level hand skill can greatly increase the success rate. However, the hand skill is not a standard skill for wizards or scholars, and Zhao Xuan needs to invest 10 points to reach level 5.

Once Zhao Xuan reaches level 5 in hand skill, he can probably make his magical actions indistinguishable from ordinary actions. This means that no one will be able to detect his magic. If he can also muffle the sound of his incantation, his every magical action will become a sudden attack. This is the strategic value of the "Deception Magic" skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

While Lei An didn't expect the three of them to display their skills in front of him, the three players who had no skills at all would still need to have at least 10 skill points left over. Zhao Xu had only reached level 3 and had just regained his skill points, with 3 points of intelligence and 1 point of humanity. He also obtained some skills from his profession, but he had to wait until he officially advanced to get them, and the scroll scholar got 4 points.

The three of them were bombarded by Lei An's attacks and were forced to learn the secrets of "concealment spell" and sign a contract to guarantee that they wouldn't leak any information from the "true illusion world". After that, they were chased away by Lei An.

When Zhao Xu asked him what to do if he forgot, Lei An simply told him to go back and ask the two women.

The three of them went to the 8th floor separately, each taking the alchemy elevator. This time, they went down together.

After their adventure in the Forest of Mysterious Illusions, the three of them finally felt like they had gained a sense of camaraderie.

"Are you satisfied with being the number one player?" Eschwiet asked after pressing the first button.

Zhao Xu was taken aback by this question.

The memories in his mind opened, and a flood of information flashed through his mind.

Unconsciously, he bypassed the first team and directly reached the top.

Among players, even the highest-level players were only level 2 warriors, with some reportedly about to reach level 3. However, it was still impossible for them to achieve that level and obtain the title of first-ranked player.
On the forum, in all the Arthur discussion groups, no one knows that there are still 2nd level mages now. As for 3rd level mages, that's even more unbelievable. Once the news of Zhao Xu becoming a 3rd level mage leaks out, some mages who have been stuck for a long time may have the idea of smashing TC's windows on the spot.

"I really can't tell that you have this kind of temperament," Aisvi said, looking at Zhao Xu, who was a little absent-minded, shaking his head.

"What temperament?" Zhao Xu didn't react.

"The temperament of a king," Aisvi said. Usually, aren't the first ones very domineering?

Zhao Xu shook his head and laughed. He didn't expect Aisvi, who looked very smart and steady, to have such a childish mentality. The real king in the future is the one next to him. 

When everyone gets the real attributes and abilities a year later, that will be the real beginning. By then, Zhao Xu will truly become a high-intelligence mage.

"No, Mr. Zhongxia is still very reliable," Wang Ningwei said with a smile, covering her mouth. "Aisvi, you are also very reliable."

At this time, the alchemy elevator finally slowly reached the first floor, and the steel gate slowly opened, and the hopeful sunlight fell on the three young faces again.

Zhao Xu looked at the tallest spire in front of him.

Second level spell, here he comes.
