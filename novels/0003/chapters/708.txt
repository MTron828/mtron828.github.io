Chapter 709: The Six Rings

This time, Zhao Xuan's journey to the depths of the abyss was particularly noteworthy, as he reached the "Bottomless Domain", where some secrets that he had previously experienced were torn apart before his eyes.

The abyssal will, which was the inverted image of his consciousness, made a single request of him: to formally accept the identity of the abyssal master.

Zhao Xuan did not object to this.

According to the will of "Anshiniya", which he had imagined, he re-emerged outside, and it was inevitable that the abyssal lord who was chasing him would discover him.

The abyssal will could also protect him, but at this time, the Lord of the Nine Prisons, Asmordius, had already turned his attention to the abyss, and was anxiously waiting to see if his longtime dead enemy would reappear.

Therefore, Zhao Xuan thought for a while and realized that he could rely most on his own abilities and skills.

He decided to utilize the abyssal Bottomless Domain to learn the Six Rings almost without any pause, in order to solidify his 11th-level abilities.

Considering the complex situation, Zhao Xuan decided that, unlike his previous extremely complicated route, he would choose the "Devoted Pray" profession in the 11th-level profession.

At this time, his profession line changed to:

Profession 1: 5th-level Mage/3rd-level Super Mage/3rd-level Magic Shield/1st-level Monk

Profession 2: 1st-level Cleric/4th-level Scribe/4th-level Incantation Guardian/1st-level Military Sword/1st-level Devoted Pray

As a profession in the Six Rings, the Devoted Pray was a role that endeavored to approach the divine, and the divine spirit that guarded himself descended great and eternal miracles.
Here is the translation of the text:

The faithful feel the thrill of the divine presence, as if they are standing in the midst of the divine realm, and this spiritual experience is a supreme honor for the faithful. Therefore, as they continue to excavate this path, they slowly realize that their mental and physical abilities have made significant progress, and they have become virtuous pray-ers, a profession that embodies the divine art.

Some virtuous pray-ers believe that instead of dedicating their entire life to the divine, they should strive to align themselves with certain abstract principles, such as becoming a symbol of a particular creed.

Those who hold this view gradually open up a notable path for virtuous pray-ers.

Most virtuous pray-ers are thinkers who, through continuous travel and missionary work, spread their creed to others, even though they may not be devoutly devoted to the divine. In this respect, Zhao Xu, who has reached the depths of his will, has chosen "chaos" as his creed.

This is the key to his transformation into a virtuous pray-er, which is far more rapid and swift than any previous advancement.

As for the requirements for advancement, there are two: first, a level 13 knowledge of religion, which Zhao Xu has just reached after listening to the creation myth; second, a ring of divine art, which he has possessed from the beginning.

However, there is a special requirement: one must have had contact with certain existences.

This condition is easily broken by some, but impossible for others. "Existences" refer to gods, their attendants, or even intelligent beings that embody the highest principles of a particular creed.

Interestingly, Zhao Xu has had contact with all these existences.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not referring to Sylvia, the messenger of the Fiendish God, and her servants. Instead, it's referring to the abyss before his eyes and the projection of his will, all of which are closely related to him.

After completing this level of progress, Zhao Xu also obtained the key ability of the first-level devoted priest: an extra domain and sacred light.

The sacred light can make Zhao Xu immune to all diseases, including magical diseases such as corruption and beastification.

Another crucial point is that he obtained the "extra domain"!

Prior to this, Zhao Xu had already obtained an additional "knowledge domain" due to his background as a monk, which was exchanged for knowledge devoutness.

At this level, he also obtained the fourth domain, which is comparable to a specialization.

Meanwhile, this progress will not discount any "spellcaster levels", so Zhao Xu also successfully obtained the five-ring divine art.

The prerequisite for the "devoted priest" progress is relatively low, and it is only necessary to touch some existing entities. However, the key is that only those with at least 10th-level religious knowledge can meet this requirement, which is why this progress is not common.

There are not many divine art masters above the 10th level.

After completing these, Zhao Xu silently sensed the mystical models transmitted from this void.

At this moment, he opened his entire body and mind to subtly absorb the feedback given to him by the abyssal will.

Countless mysterious symbols, reassembled, exchanged, and condensed, like a puzzle, through Zhao Xu's "Wise Heart Spellcaster" channel, reassembling in Zhao Xu's heart.
Here is the translation:

According to theory, both the arcane and divine disciplines are based on the method of "recording magic" and "preparing magic". Therefore, even if a mage has recorded the arcane version of a spell, they still need to re-record the divine version.

This is also the reason why many mages hesitate. The costs of "borrowing", "recording", and "time" can overwhelm a mage who wants to understand the vast majority of magic. Especially for those who have mastered the entire catalog of spells, they are more susceptible to external temptations.

However, the arcane tome still has channels such as the Mage Association and certain alchemy shops. In contrast, the divine tome requires mages to deliberately learn the art of recording and recording, which is already challenging. Only mages who are fond of recording tomes, like the goddess of magic, can learn this art.

Mages like druids, rangers, and paladins, who rely on intuition, find it even more difficult to record tomes. Therefore, Zhao Xu is also tightly grasping this rare opportunity.

Especially since he has just completed crossing over and can no longer rely on his previous "system shortcuts" to learn magic instantly in the "final tome" space. At this moment, he has finally returned to a normal mage's identity, honestly studying and understanding each spell's structure, and then recording them.

From the moment he became aware that he would link his fate with Ernest's, magic is no longer a powerful tool for Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, he is more concerned with the weight on his shoulders, carrying the responsibility of establishing the entire magical civilization at a certain point in history. Thus, he thoroughly analyzed each magical technique, reaching an unprecedented level of mastery.

Considering the necessity of going out, he still focused on strengthening his magical abilities.

Simultaneously, he carefully organized the entire magical system, one system at a time.

However, after taking a glance, his eyebrows furrowed, as if he had discovered a secret technique in the sixth circle of the "Yao Guang Zhan" spell, which could transform close-range weapons, throwing weapons, or a set of ammunition into energy weapons, allowing them to bypass armor defense.

This was a "+4" level enchantment, making a warrior wielding energy weapons virtually invincible.

For Zhao Xu, who possessed a ghostly technique, his ghostly technique became even stronger, capable of penetrating even the natural defense, and not being affected by the characteristics of energy weapons being unable to harm undead creatures, construct creatures, or objects.

As he glanced at another spell in the sixth circle, known as the "Xi Dui Long Xing" spell, which could alter a mage's close-range combat output, he immediately used this spell.

A blazing flame burned within his chest, followed by a deep red scale emerging from his body, quickly covering his entire body. Two wings capable of blocking out the sun grew from his shoulder blades.

He had transformed into a dragon!

And a pungent sulfur smell slowly spread throughout the air.

Zhao Xu gazed at his own appearance as a young red dragon, a highly customized spell that granted him spitting attacks and corresponding expertise, as well as a 60-point increase in vitality.

However, upon seeing the mediocre 20th-level attack, Zhao Xu shook his head, deciding to dispel the spell.
Here is the translation:

He realized that after his combat strength had increased significantly, some spells that seemed to have a high cost-effectiveness to others now appeared to be uneconomical to him, as they would actually reduce his strength instead. His spell selection needed to be tailored to his own character card.

He jumped directly from the transformation system to the defense system, his eyes fixated on it.

In the sixth circle, the spell "Progressive Enhancement of Defense" appeared, which could grant a 6-tier bonus to resistances and immunity to all enemies. Unfortunately, Zhao Xu's Sage Robe already met his needs, so he didn't need to use it every day. He abandoned it.

However, a crucial spell emerged - "Anti-Magic Field".

From then on, Zhao Xu would no longer need to spend his time every day using the spell "Anti-Magic Field" to survive. This ability combined with his "Iron Will" would allow him to kill even legendary mages who failed to prepare for a "battle of action". He would tell this legendary mage what it means to have a "sand-bag" punch.

As for the spell "Higher Dispel Magic", it was just a pale imitation of nothing. The enemies he faced were not strong enough to be dispelled by him.

In the sixth circle of the illusion system, a spell that was quite dashing but not particularly powerful - "Eternal Illusion" - emerged.

He could create a region of illusions and simulate visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile sensations. As long as he focused his mind, he could control these illusions.

The key was that the spell's effect was permanent.

The power of the spell was limited to his imagination only.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu opened the sixth circle of the prophecy system that the main event began.

For example, the spell "Stone Eye" could create an invisible magic detector that could move underground and provide Zhao Xu with visual effects of the detector.
Here is the translation:

Just like the secret art of the four rings, this spell can be sustained, allowing the caster to always have a "powerful detection eye" at their disposal, and their ability to dig can also allow them to explore unknown rooms that even they themselves are unaware of.

With this spell, even all underground cities can be considered to have no secrets.

The second spell is the "Position Detection" spell, which, through a one-hour ritual, allows the caster to perceive their surroundings and part the fog in front of them, allowing them to see and hear what is happening at a location.

The difficulty of the spell depends on the caster's level.

Zhao Xu can also use the "detector" generated by the local environment to cast detection and transmission spells such as "evil detection" and "telepathy".

"Telepathy" is essentially a zero-ring voice transmission spell that can be used to control which people in the scene can hear the message.

Zhao Xu also has enough means, such as "precognition", "multitalented caster", and the "selective spell" ability obtained through the spell guard, to compress spellcasting actions into a single round.

This means that, as long as he wants and his level is sufficient, he can always activate "video phone" and "monitoring recording" at any moment in any dimension or location.

This ability to invade others' lives at will is also exhibited throughout the entire magical system.

However, Zhao Xu's ultimate goal is fixed on a spell he has known and been waiting for - the "God's Eye".

A powerful spell originating from the giant dragon.

After Zhao Xu records it in his heart, he activates the "Super Spell Control" ability and combines it with the "Spell Sustenance" expertise to cast this six-ring spell.

The next moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

In front of him, a vague, half-transparent shadow appeared, moving in synchronization, but existing simultaneously in two different places.

At this moment, Zhao Xu saw the future, able to predict the enemy's next move, allowing him to gain a 2-level bonus in defense and reflexes.

But even more crucial and powerful is the fact that—

At any time and in any location, regardless of what he did just now, whether attacking or casting a spell.

He can continue to complete a "standard action" within the "connection" period.

Once he does this, the spell's effect will immediately end.

After that, Zhao Xu can use the "swift burst" to gain another "standard action" in the blink of an eye.

Moreover, he can also learn the advanced action flow "trigger technique".

Trigger technique can maintain its effect for a day, allowing him to set up spells targeting himself (up to 6th circle).

Once the trigger condition is met, the designated "set spell" will immediately take effect.

Therefore, Zhao Xu can use the trigger technique to set up the " oracle's eye" again, triggering the condition of the "oracle's eye" spell ending, or simply blinking his eyes.

At that moment, an automatic "oracle's eye" will be generated on his body, continuing to convert into "standard actions".

From then on, the number of spells Zhao Xu can cast within a 6-second period will be—
swift burst + standard action + standard action (swift burst) + standard action (oracle's eye) + standard action (trigger oracle's eye).
A total of 5 spells.

The high-level mage's action battle has officially been torn open by him.
