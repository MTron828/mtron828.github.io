Chapter 590: The Ghostly Tide

After crossing over, all the people on Earth lost their original sense of fun. Books, movies, and short videos, which were the cheapest forms of entertainment, could no longer be enjoyed. As for more upscale outdoor activities, it was unthinkable.

However, the original wilderness landscape of the post-apocalyptic wasteland had become the only new and exciting thing for city dwellers who were used to seeing high-rise buildings. They would occasionally spot beasts that were as tall as humans and extremely violent.

Just like children who grew up in the countryside, who would climb mountains from a young age and have no interest in so-called "XX Mountain Scenic Area" when they grew up. Even if the outdoor environment was beautiful, city dwellers would soon get tired of it and would have to gather firewood to survive.

After experiencing the initial fear and "hunger" crisis, people began to miss entertainment more and more.

Although they were exhausted from working hard all day, the campsite would still be lively around sunset. Simple games like soccer and wrestling became the most popular options.

Therefore, when the sunlight was good on this rare day, a real-life warrior battle broke out, and everyone was extremely excited.

Scholars who wanted to learn would watch the warriors' combat techniques, while those who loved to watch would want to see the two sides clash in a bloody and fiery manner.

Zhou Xun, who had lived in the campsite in his previous life, was naturally accustomed to such scenes. Sometimes, he would have to personally intervene and put out a few fires.

It's worth noting that before he crossed over, his physique was average, and he didn't have the strength of a chicken without wings, but he definitely had no muscle mass.
After crossing over, he obtained a body with 28 talent points, relying on 16 strength and 16 power. This kind of physique can be considered as a powerful wrestler among humans, and he moved without fear, wrestling anyone he encountered.

In this world, Zhao Xu's strength alone is a full 49 points! 

Fighting a dragon barehanded, this description of his strength is definitely not an exaggeration. Even ancient dragons cannot defeat him in an arm-wrestling match.

8 innate + 30 unnamed (realm of decay) + 6 enhancement (divine power) + 5 internal (strong body manual), which means his strength adjustment is as high as 19 levels.

The combat level of an ordinary warrior increases by 1 level per level. For example, the 5th level warrior player in front of him has 5 levels of combat skills, which means a full 5 levels of basic attack, and then adding the adjustment from strength, that is the actual attack level.

Even if Zhao Xu has no combat skills, relying on the overwhelming advantage brought by his 19 levels of strength, no one can stop his sword.

He is a force to be reckoned with.

He can bully people like this, even if he has no understanding of swordsmanship, relying on his powerful body that can carry 20 tons, all skills are just talk, and no combat power can withstand his punch.

Not to mention, with the four-ring divine power in the battle shepherd's three-piece set, his basic combat level has been raised to the equivalent of level 10, equivalent to a level 10 warrior!

This enduring spell constantly nourishes his whole body, injecting powerful combat awareness into him through the power of the gods, while also giving him 6 points of strength enhancement and 33 temporary hit points.

Zhao Xu didn't delay and walked to the front.

He no longer has the mentality of the arrogant young man in the past. Even if he brings a group of negotiators with him using teleportation, he does not reveal his identity.
Here is the translation of the text:

The main thing is that he doesn't bother with too many official matters, preferring to leave it to others and take responsibility himself. However, international relations are no small matter, and his current identity involves the reputation of Asia, although it's a bit shady, but he has no choice but to face it.

"I'm Lu Tie, a 5th-level warrior player, and my previous game ID was 'Windy Youth'," the warrior player said with a slightly embarrassed expression.

Only someone in their thirties like him would come up with an ID name like that. Few players would use their real name after crossing over, but if the other party is also a player, they would often add their previous ID to see if there's any connection. "Asia, Zhang Qi, 6th-level warrior," Zhao Xu reported Zhang Qi's name without any psychological burden.

Moreover, he intentionally reported his level to be one level higher than the other party's, so even if he loses, the other party won't lose face.

Initially, Zhao Xu thought the other party was upset about being recruited by Asia and was sent to negotiate with him. However, after reading the other party's mind, he realized it wasn't that. He didn't plan to create a scene either.

In many cases, competitors on the sports field may even be good friends behind the scenes. After all, work is work, and life is life.

The temporary force camp set up by Asia is naturally welcomed by the lower-ranking people, who see it as a safe haven. However, for those who have already occupied high-ranking positions in the new camp, it's like a phoenix-like situation, especially when the number of people increases, raising concerns about their future treatment.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, looking at it objectively, Lu Tie, who was considered a high-ranking official, didn't think about this kind of thing, and Zhao Xu also put down his defensive thoughts, adopting a more instructional mindset.

"These weapons are all for practice, and they're made of ironwood, which is similar in weight. They can only cause bruises, Zhang Qi, you can go ahead and try one that's well-suited to your hand."

As Zhao Xu was preparing to customize a "magic sword" based on the Nine Swords style, he was carrying a regular, refined weapon this time, without any magical effects.

This weapon was sharp and could cause harm at any moment, so Zhao Xu's gaze swept across the wooden weapons on the rack.

His gaze finally landed on a single-handed, close-range weapon called a "long sword".

The ironwood long sword had a newly polished, smooth finish, but there were no residual wood shavings or sharp edges. There was also a coil of rope around the hilt to prevent it from slipping out of hand.

As a single-handed weapon, the holder could also hold a shield. This straight-bladed weapon represented the honor and bravery of knights and was deeply loved by Saint Warriors.

Vivian held the "Holy Avenger" in her hand, which was also a long sword.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had mastered the "Holy Sword Technique" of the Four Rings, which allowed him to transform his long sword into a +5 magic long sword, dealing additional damage to evil creatures and possessing an anti-evil array.

However, Zhao Xu's primary consideration was the style of the Nine Swords.

Whether strong or weak, as a Nine Swords professional, the main emphasis was on being stylish.

After all, it was necessary to become like the legendary swordsmen of legend, wielding a long sword across the land.

As Zhao Xu lightly took down the long sword and grasped the hilt, he then casually drew the sword and tossed it in a flourish, looking completely ordinary and not drawing too much attention.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, in that instant, he completed the "Master's Touch" technique, similar to the "Scholar's Touch" that allows one to directly understand the content of a book.

The three major occupations of mage, priest, and scribe do not master the long sword, so Zhao Xiu used the "Master's Touch" technique, which immediately allowed him to master the weapon in his hand.

This technique, which can be maintained for a long time, allows the wielder to issue commands to the weapon and control it with their will, which is what is often referred to as "man and sword as one" in martial arts novels.

Therefore, warriors who can master most weapons are ordinary people among ordinary people, and are the leaders of the military.

However, Zhao Xiu's "Master's Touch" only applies to the long sword in his hand, and he would need to cast the spell again if he were to switch to another long sword.

"Please teach me."

As soon as Zhao Xiu mastered the weapon, he suddenly asked the void, "What is this?"

An instant muffled sound echoed through the air, as if thunder had struck, and the sound waves shattered everyone's eardrums. The sword's speed was extremely fast, and no one in the audience could see it clearly, as if the sword was reborn.

Those who had thought that Lu Tie was the current limit of the player's combat power were shocked.

Even the children who had always admired this warrior instructor felt a sense of idolization shatter, as they could see that the instructor's sword was something they could emulate.

The mysterious warrior's sword, which exceeded everyone's understanding, made people wonder.

"Is it a sonic weapon?"

"No, it's our weapon."

"What's going on? My ears are still ringing, and I'm experiencing tinnitus."

The players who were maintaining order in the audience were all astonished, staring intensely at Zhao Xiu's long sword, trying to figure out the mystery behind it.

Most "magical weapons" can attach magical abilities to weapons.
Spells that have additional effects are usually limited to just ice and fire abilities, but a sword that can trigger a sonic boom is unprecedented.

Facing Zhao Xu, the warrior Lu Tie's face stiffened as he humbly asked, "May I inquire about the strength of your attack? How many floors did you just reach?"

At that moment, Zhao Xu glanced at his character panel and, in the close combat attack row, even though he wielded a magical weapon, his level had directly soared to over 30, making him a top-notch player. He could easily slaughter a giant dragon without any hesitation.

"About level 30?" Zhao Xu estimated a number.

As soon as he said this, a huge silence fell over the entire venue.

If there was only a few levels of difference in skill, they could still compare and compete based on specific performance. But with a level above 30, even if Lu Tie was wearing full body armor, a casual sword strike could easily shatter it and kill Zhao Xu.

This was the brutal nature of a level 30 attack!

Suddenly, an urgent whistle sounded, and a young man kept running and shouting, "Something bad is happening, something bad is happening. There are a lot of undead outside!"

Upon hearing this, everyone panicked and looked up.

Zhao Xu's face also darkened. The third major cause of population decline, aside from food shortages and negative energy emissions, the undead wave, had finally arrived after two weeks of crossing.

Arthur, do you really think that the Earth's population is too large and needs to be reduced by means of natural selection?

Zhao Xu couldn't help but ponder this.
