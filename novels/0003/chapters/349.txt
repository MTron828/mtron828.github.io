Chapter 350: Heard It's Very Strong

"Go ahead," Zhao Xū didn't seem to be unwilling to talk.

In reality, he was thinking about whether to involve Zheng Xin'an in this matter.

"Mr. Zhong Xia, we also have a saying on Earth that the statue of the goddess of protection must be escorted to Mystra," he said casually.

"However, I'm not intentionally bothering you, Mr. Zhong Xia, I just want to ask for your opinion," Zheng Xin'an said with a hint of embarrassment.

She now knew that these NPCs were not as mechanical as ordinary game characters, but had their own personalities, some being lazy, some being determined to defend their beliefs.

She had always found it difficult to guess the thought process of this silent and serious Zhong Xia.

However, it was this diverse world that had recently gotten her hooked on the game.

When Zhao Xū heard what Zheng Xin'an said, he smiled slightly, "What did you figure out?"

Zheng Xin'an looked down, gazing at her shoelaces, "I remember that 'Pyromaniac Syndrome' is not a disease transmitted from person to person, but rather a disease caused by being bitten by a monster."

"That's right, old witch, the medium-sized evil alien, with a height and weight similar to that of a normal human, will directly attack good beings if it has the upper hand. It has the ability to perform magic and invade dreams, and its bite will bring about 'Demonic Fever' disease," Zhao Xū recited directly from his knowledge and some memories stored in his brain.

This statement left Zheng Xin'an almost with her mouth agape. She had not expected that she had gone to ask a few experienced players and received only a few words of advice, whereas the lecturer in front of her had basically summarized the entire monster in just a few sentences.
Here is the translation of the text:

"After being awakened, I privately asked the other party about it. The other party told me that they had encountered a witch-like old woman who had revealed that there was a special ring in their home. The old woman refused to give up the ring and was bitten by the old woman, resulting in the contraction of this disease."

"The old woman was instructed by the witch to bring the ring to the other party in the afternoon, and only then could her 'curse' be lifted. The woman herself had also decided to hand over the ring to dispel the curse. She had just brought it with her."

As Zheng Xin allowed the ring to be passed to Zhao Xiu to examine, he said, "The ring's owner said that she had saved her, and the witch was very interested in this thing, so she gave it to me as a reward for saving her."

"In the past, she wore this ring mainly to avoid being affected by too much noise, allowing her to sleep more soundly. This was also the reason she initially refused to sell it to the witch-like old woman, who knows what kind of disaster may come later."

Zhao Xiu didn't expect any unexpected gains and reached out to take the ring.

At this point, he lightly adjusted the golden copper frame of his "Mechanical Eye Protector" on his nose ridge, focusing on the bronze ring face, and felt the inner toothed groove.

The "Detection Magic" was transformed through the eye protector, and a beam of light fell on the ring, gradually feeding back information to Zhao Xiu's brain.

Indeed, a creature of this level 9 challenge had some differences in itself.

At this moment, he gazed at Zheng Xin'an with a shocked expression, unable to believe that his disciple had brought him an extra magical item on his first day. "This is the Silent Art Ring," he said.

"Ah?" Zheng Xin'an had recently been browsing through forums and had learned about various magical items, including the Silent Art Ring. However, she had never heard of this specific item before.

Zhao Xu seemed to read Zheng Xin'an's confusion and explained it in a friendly tone, "This is a non-core magic item, and it's normal not to have heard of it. The Silent Art Ring can be activated once a day, and the user can cast a spell with the same name as the ring's ability."

"In addition, during the effect of the Silent Art Ring, you can cast three spells with a level of three rings or lower without needing to use verbal components. The price is around 2000 gold coins, which is a good deal."

As he spoke, he put the ring on his finger, doing so with a smooth and familiar motion.

Originally, he had planned to visit that old witch, but who could have expected such a convenient opportunity?

However, this Silent Art Ring is a rare item, and if it were more well-known, it's likely that the wizards and clerics of Mistral would have already discovered and acquired it.

Zheng Xin'an was not oblivious to the strategic significance of casting three spells silently. This also meant that the old witch had judged the value of this ring and was willing to go to great lengths to obtain it.

"That's the plan," Zheng Xin'an said with some concern, although the other party had been attacked in the wilderness.
Here is the translation of the text:

But thinking about Old Granny's terrifying abilities, she still had some reservations. "It's definitely safe," Zhao Xu explained. "As long as the opponent lives in Mistral, Old Granny wouldn't dare to invade uninvited."

In this day and age, not everyone has a powerful background like that devil, and ordinary monsters that don't have a strong background have already become materials for shops.

At this moment, his gaze fell on Zheng Xin'an's body, and he smiled and asked, "Do you want to solve the opponent? That's a level 9 monster, you know."

"Ah?" Zheng Xin'an slightly frowned, "I'm not brave enough..."

But after a while, she revealed a curious expression, "However, I'm indeed quite curious."

"Let's go, there's a break in the afternoon, I'll take you to see Old Granny's abilities," Zhao Xu said.

"Wait a minute, do you have a plan to take on the opponent? That's why you've been standing here waiting for me all this time?" Zheng Xin'an looked at Zhao Xu with a bright gaze, unable to help but take a few extra looks.

Zhao Xu didn't expect Zheng Xin'an to be so perceptive, but he still explained again, "Don't think too much, Old Granny has a heart-shaped stone on her body, which can remove 10 diseases. I want to take that thing."

"Ha ha, okay," Zheng Xin'an smiled brightly.

Suddenly, at this moment, a few of Zheng Xin'an's online gaming friends saw her shadow and rushed over, panting heavily.

"Xin'an, Xin'an, do you know? That celestial shadow god has broken through again, reaching level 6 this time."

"Just the other day, players finally refreshed the second record, officially becoming a 4th-level warrior. Who knew it wouldn't take long for them to break through to 5th level and set a new record."
After a decade of grinding, Zheng Xin Yin had finally reached level 1 and was now looking to level up again. Even the so-called "stellar projection" had broken through to level 5 as a mage, far surpassing the imagination of these fellow mages. In general, it was rare for a mage to reach level 5 within a year of starting their career.

Moreover, Zheng Xin Yin's friend was excited, his face flushed with excitement. "Who would have thought that the profession description would be like this - mage level 5, level 1 advanced, and even appear to be an advanced profession!" Zheng Xin Yin was also taken aback.

Although no player had yet touched the advanced profession, just the name had already hinted at something extraordinary.

"Explain to me, Lecturer, what is an advanced profession?" Zheng Xin Yin turned back and looked at Zhao Xudao.

"Well, you can think of it as another form of part-time job, and it also requires certain prerequisites," Zhao Xudao explained in simple terms.

He didn't expect that this time he wouldn't even log off before someone came online to give him a live demonstration of the "jumping clause" appearing.

Originally, Zhao Xudao had always been quiet and low-key, but since the appearance of this clause, he had leveled up quickly and had become a focus of attention for everyone.

"Is the advanced profession strong?" Zheng Xin Yin asked.

The other female players who saw Zhao Xudao were busy bowing and greeting him, while also curiously asking questions and widening their eyes, ready to listen to the lecturer's explanation.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It seems that none of the players have ever touched on advanced professions, and even the existence of advanced professions is a blank slate on the forums.

Just at that moment, they unexpectedly met a priest who was familiar with the middle-level content.
Zhao Xun felt a bit awkward.
This was too direct, asking the person themselves, and it was hard to say whether he was boasting or not.
After a while, he said, "Advanced professions have strengths and weaknesses. From a practical perspective, professions like mages and priests have good expansion potential. Even something like a druid, its flexibility is higher when it comes to advanced professions."
"What about the 6th-level player who ranked first?" a female player exclaimed, continuing to ask Zhao Xun with enthusiasm.
Essentially, whatever Zhao Xun said at this point would become evidence of NPC forces.
He originally thought of covering it up, but then he remembered the keyboard warriors on the forums, and if he said something wrong, he might not be able to sleep peacefully afterwards.
So he opened his mouth and said, "Well, I've heard that his advanced profession is very strong, extremely strong, that kind of thing."
