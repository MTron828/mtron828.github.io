Chapter 434: The Man in the Sky

"In the middle of the night, a message suddenly popped up on the phones of countless players in the Northern Alliance: 'We're about to go to war in that twilight forest!' This call was for the group of people who live closest to that area.

'What's going on?' Zhang Qi just finished watching a healing anime at home and suddenly noticed the message on his phone.

Originally, they were planning to camp and stay in the game for the next few days, but with the upcoming New Year, everyone was too busy to gather. So they decided to log off and meet up again at a scheduled time tomorrow.

'A big deal has happened! Just now, the Azure Palace announced that everyone within a 50-kilometer radius will ascend to the sky. Then, anyone who enters within the next six hours will be instantly dropped off.'

A classmate who had just browsed the forum spoke up in the game group of their school's academy.

After four months of fermentation, the game group now has over a hundred members.

'It's not just one door, is it? How come it's only been two days?' Zhang Qi suddenly slapped his thigh. They had only halfway arrived at the twilight forest, and it was already almost time to get there.

Who could have thought that it would suddenly turn like this and be so close to the end.

'Exactly, if it weren't for the Azure Palace's announcement, the Summer Uncle would probably have made a fortune by now.'
Here is the translation of the text:

"How did he manage to get it? This door hasn't even been opened yet, he probably didn't get it." Du Nian, a classmate of Zhang Qi, was chatting with his family by the fireplace, munching on potato chips and typing on his phone.

"Too simple," someone retorted. "The announcement that the Eldrid Palace is leaving and the one that passed through the second door not long ago completely explains the connection between the Eldrid Palace ascending to heaven and him."

"You can go to the forum and see for yourself. It's basically everyone's guess that the player named Xun Xia found the 'shortcut' and directly obtained the artifact, and the strongest player will be born."

"So now, the explosion area in the Twilight Forest is surrounded by adventurers from the nearby towns, all rushing to get there, but they're still being suppressed by the Reverse Magic Zone."

"You guys who are in the Twilight Forest, hurry up and take your share!"

This sentence suddenly sparked the curiosity of the nocturnal creatures who were still awake, and several people directly speculated about the scale of the next battle.

Unfortunately, the players from Zhao Xu University, most of whom were descended from the Winter City of the Arthurian legend, would have to take a long time to rush to the explosion center in the Twilight Forest, even if they rode a horse non-stop.

Class monitor Fang Xueying, who had just finished styling her hair, looked at the lively discussion in the group and couldn't help but mock, "If the other side doesn't have the artifact, then you're all just going for nothing. If they do, then you're all just sending someone off."

"Not wrong," someone immediately responded. "And besides, the other side is still our player, an Arthurian local, who must investigate regardless, and they also have the capital. But what can we players do even if we catch them?"

"This has nothing to do with killing the owner and the artifact dropping. It's just like throwing water into a bamboo basket."

This sentence immediately made all the players who were confused by the artifact clear their heads.
Here is the translation of the text:

They all seemed to have forgotten, including the one with five revival stones. If the opponent was decisive, they could directly use the "return to city" skill and block most of the damage. However, this group of students had always been mixed, and soon, opposing voices emerged: "Who let you guys take the divine artifact?" "Have you forgotten the gains from the Star Lake battle? Have you forgotten the armor taken from those cavalrymen? Arthur didn't have a setting to refresh corpses after killing mercenaries!" This sentence instantly shocked the dreamer. The players naturally couldn't pick up the divine artifact, but once they started a battle, it would mean a golden harvest. The one with the divine artifact, "Zhongxia", couldn't pick up the equipment on the corpses in time. At this moment, they could clearly get another reward. Those who were killed by Zhongxia would definitely be turned into dust. Suddenly, everyone's topic turned to how to pick up equipment. Various discussion methods emerged one after another. Some righteous paladins who kept to the code thought that picking up equipment from corpses was immoral, but seeing the intensity of the discussion, they quietly swallowed their words. It wasn't until a cold sentence appeared: "By the way, who's in the Twilight Forest now?" "..." "Ah..." At this moment, the one hiding under the quilt, Nan Xiaoyi, was sharing gossip with her friend. Seeing the group chat, she almost dropped the cup. This group of amateur players, who had not completed their training, wanted to continue playing the game after training, but no one paid attention to them. She directly turned around, lifted the quilt, and, not even bothering to put on more clothes, took a step and rushed to Zhao Xu's room.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

At this moment, Zhao Xu's room was not locked, and Nan Xiaoyi burst into the room immediately.

However, the opponent was wearing a fake helmet, lying on the bed, with a thin quilt wrapped around their body. The indicator lights above were flashing rapidly, indicating that the helmet's owner was in a state of intense excitement and agitation.

This was a stark contrast to the peaceful and quiet environment that should have been present during the night. Nan Xiaoyi was still filled with excitement and was about to ask Zhao Xu if he had really obtained the divine artifact. Seeing Zhao Xu still engaged in the game, Nan Xiaoyi fell into contemplation.

At this time, people on the forum were even placing bets on whether Zhong Xia could survive. Nan Xiaoyi silently walked out of the room, gently closing the door, and turned to head towards his virtual helmet.

As the dawn approached, the entire El'goroth Palace began to tremble.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had been preparing to close his eyes and rest, also sensed the faint humming noise emitted by the stone monument in the middle of the hall.

At the same time, he was constantly adjusting his emotions.

"What's going on, will these two legendary golems not be released?" Vivi An asked, already having tightened her entire silver armor.

"There's no problem, let's keep it under wraps for now," Zhao Xu said, lightly waving his death spirit staff. "If the external forces are strong enough, we'll release them later."

As he spoke, he also gazed forward, as if he could see through the gray-white stone wall and behold the adventurers gathered around the meteorite crater in the twilight forest.

Although El'goroth Palace had issued a notice, he had ultimately delayed it by four days.

This was his greatest shield against the anti-magic field.
Here is the translation of the text:

The higher the position, the stronger the person, but it's less likely that they would waste time near here for the first two days. Instead, they would gather here in six days to attack. Even if these powerful individuals are woken up by someone in the middle of the night, they are unlikely to complete the 50-kilometer route in just two hours.

So, the only thing that bothers them is dealing with the organized forces, such as the town guard from nearby towns. After sunrise, they will naturally become the just and righteous guardians on the surface. However, in the dim light of night, once the mask is lifted, who can still tell who is who?

Suddenly, a clear and crisp bell tone echoed.

"Clang!"

This time, the impact sound seemed to strike the heart, and it directly woke up the people who were sleeping in the forest. In an instant, everyone's gaze turned to the source of the bell tone, which was the location of the meteorite crater.

For a moment, it was as if a chorus of singing nuns was singing in this vast hall, with a reverberation effect added.

Vivian also quietly sank into this ethereal mood, slowly closing her eyes.

"Let's go."

Zhao Xu instantly pressed the point and jumped up, standing up with his staff in hand.

Suddenly, a superheavy sensation came.

"We're rising from the bottom of the earth," Vivian exclaimed, her eyes snapping open and revealing a flash of light.

At that moment, the palace that had risen like a rocket into the sky, began to oscillate with increasing amplitude, and Zhao Xu quickly grabbed Vivian's hand, keeping his balance in this hall.

A white light flashed by, like a divine blessing, bathing the two people's bodies.

"...What's going on?"

"It seems that the ground is a bit strange."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The crater formed by the meteorite that landed in the Ai Zhu Palace is a half-circular pit with a deep excavation, originally located at the center of the volcanic rock that was boiling out of the earth. However, due to cooling, it has turned into a large, ugly black spot.

But countless adventurers have already descended into this cooled crater, holding torches and lanterns, and searching for clues under the extremely dim night light as the summer solstice is about to arrive.

As the two companions began to squat down to examine the ground beneath their feet, they suddenly found themselves in an unforgettable scene.

A mysterious palace that looked like a fortress suddenly burst out of the ground, exploding countless stones that had been petrified on the surface. Instantly, a sandstorm swept over the entire crater, covering the heads of the searchers.

But the searchers had already lost their attention to the top of their heads, with their eyes fixed intently on the palace floating in the air.

The palace suddenly released a beam of eerie white light, and one after another, the bodies of the adventurers fell to the ground under the driving force of the light.

"Aha, it's Captain Luka of the Tower of Lu Ka, who dared to sneak into the Ai Zhu Palace!"
"Look, it's the Great Wizard Mu Lin, who's even older than this!"

As the others slowly recognized the faces of the strong ones scattered by the white light, the speculation suddenly became widespread.

But as the voices gradually weakened, the searchers noticed that these once-powerful names had become nothing more than corpses.

At this moment, time was playing a cruel joke on them.

The white light that had been shed was all corpses.

These corpses with identities were so afraid to even approach and grab their equipment, let alone take on professional adventurers. "What is this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, a player noticed the corpses and the scattered particles, and pointed to the mysterious white light that had just descended, asking, "Is that Summer's person?"

A adventurer gazed at the palace of Aizhou and the crowd below.

At the top of everyone's head, at the focal point of everyone's gaze.

A wizard, dressed in a mysterious robe and a starlight cloak, hovered in mid-air, as if standing on a flat ground.

He held a long metal staff of magical authority in one hand and a legendary staff of bone fragments in the other hand.

The man remained silent, gazing ahead, as the crowd on the ground sparkled like countless stars.
