Chapter 64: Origin

Most of these mages have prepared a few fixed spells to shoot at the fixed targets on the underground platform. The frozen beam and magic missiles they release are basically spells Zhao Xu is familiar with and has studied.

This makes him a bit perplexed, and he can even identify them without using the "Spell Identification" skill. "Teacher, I feel something's off," Zhao Xu finally couldn't help but bring it up.

"Yes?"

"What I mean is, I heard a certain incantation, which is a spell I recognize. I also know what kind of spell the other person is casting. Even more directly, the other person is chanting the incantation loudly in front of me, such as the identification spell that takes an hour to cast. I'm not possible to not recognize it."

He has studied magic and has some experience with the "Spell Identification" skill, but this is not a challenge that can be tackled by someone with an intelligence of less than 16 points.

"Naive," Anny said with a sneer. "You're not using your current intelligence to challenge the countless years of practice by countless people."

"You're recognizing, not identifying. When you've condensed the 1st level skill, you'll know that identifying spells is a passive and instinctive behavior."

Zhao Xu heard this sentence and suddenly felt a stirring in his heart.

"It's easy for a mage to cast a spell, but what about seven or eight mages casting spells at the same time? My intelligence can handle it, but can your current intelligence keep up?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Because you've come here to train in spell recognition, it's because you've basically mastered the spells they release, and you're equivalent to having a 90% progress bar for level 1 spell recognition. It's just a matter of when you'll break through that last 10%. Otherwise, with your current 90% progress in level 0 spell recognition, you won't be able to compare to someone with true level 1 spell recognition ability."

Zhou Xu's heartstrings snapped like a broken string.

Suddenly, everyone in the scene in front of him became abstract coordinates, and those spells became curves in each coordinate system.

Zhou Xu's entire body sank into a trance-like state.

"Uh?" An Ti Nuo Ya sensed that something was off about Zhou Xu.

She directly waved her hand to cast the "Rainbow Spell" without any hesitation, isolating all external interference.

At this moment, compared to the rainbow-colored spell released by Lei An, An Ti Nuo Ya's spell had no trace, as if it had vanished into thin air.

No one in the scene noticed that a completely invisible rainbow-colored spell had enveloped the two people in the corner of the square.

Not even the personnel responsible for monitoring the safety of new mages in the area noticed the commotion.

Fortunately, An Ti Nuo Ya and Zhou Xu had started at the top of the platform, or the new mages might have accidentally touched the boundary of the rainbow spell and been struck by the seven powers of the boundary.

At this moment, Zhou Xu felt that the light points representing the three main fields of the priest were slowly brightening up in his mind.

The power of the magic field slowly emerged, pouring into his entire body, along with the powers of the other two fields, which seeped into his body.

As An Ti Nuo Ya watched the scene unfold, she immediately activated her mysterious knowledge and religious knowledge skills, beginning to associate and deduce.
Here is the translation of the text:

She, who was far beyond ordinary people, after receiving the blessing of magical equipment, directly connected to the deepest part of the "Source of Knowledge", which was terrifying.

The difficulty of the check in front of her seemed high, but under the luck of the celestial body and insight added by Anzhiya, it was like a raindrop in the scorching sun, disappearing in an instant.

Finally, Zhao Xu slowly regained his senses.

He saw that his information panel had automatically transformed into a series of identification checks for every spell he heard or saw.

["Identify the spell cast by the mage 10 meters in front of me, check result: 7+D20=7+10=17, exceeding DC16, identifying spell as 'Magic Missile'."]

["Identify the spell cast by the mage 7 meters in front of me to the left, check result: 7+D20=7+2=9, below the difficulty of the DC, failed to identify the spell."]

Zhao Xu had no time to look at the rest.

He noticed that his character card, under the skill list, showed that the spell identification skill level was 4, exceeding the skill level limit of a 1st-level character.

He looked at Anzhiya with a bewildered expression, "Teacher, my spell identification has reached level 4."

Anzhiya, who knew the situation, was still somewhat surprised by Zhao Xu's confirmation.

She nodded slightly, "So you've seen the identification check on your information panel?"

"Yes, my spell identification skill bonus is 7, where 4 points come from the 4th-level skill and 3 points from intelligence bonus. Why is it like this?" Zhao Xu asked with an incredulous tone.

Why did his spell identification suddenly rise to level 4?
It's not supposed to be a 1st-level skill that takes time to improve, right?
Why does his information panel automatically identify other people's spells?
Here is the translation of the text:

"Recognizing knowledge and magic is an ability that connects to the source. Annesse spoke softly, 'After you get the recognition level, your character card system will connect to the magic source of this world.' You can recognize other people's magic based on your experience, but the degree of understanding is different for each magic. This is very abstract.'

"But after you get the recognition level, you can automatically recognize the magic around you, relying on the power of the source. Even if you've never learned or heard of that magic before.'

"Zhao Xu finally understood what Anne was talking about, which was that recognition was actually this kind of ability.

"However, most people are just using the system, unlike Anne who knows the details.

"'So, what's the standard for recognition failure?' Zhao Xu asked.

"'Add 15 points to the magic level, and that's the recognition difficulty. If the roll is higher than the difficulty, you can recognize it.'"

Zhao Xu looked at the mages on the stage, who were casting level 1 magic. He had a recognition level of 7, and the difficulty of level 1 magic was DC16. As long as his recognition roll was 7 or higher, he could automatically see through the true nature of level 1 magic.

The magic source was 55% automatic recognition for him. The higher his skill level and intelligence, the higher the probability of automatic recognition.

It's no wonder that professionals have a crushing advantage over civilians, from attribute points to character card systems to this connection to the source.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu looked at Anne and said, 'Teacher, my knowledge and skills can also obtain additional background knowledge through successful rolls. Is this also connected to this source?'
Here is the translation:

"That's definitely it, the test result is 'the source of knowledge' giving you feedback, each time you test is an attempt to connect. I just knew what you're actually like by testing my knowledge."

Zhao Xu finally reacted and said, "But I still have a question, why my identification skill directly upgraded to level 4?"

Just then, An Niya grabbed his collar and teleported him to the training ground.

Their appearance was near the administrator, surrounded by several novice mages training their identification spells.

"You, release the 'magic missile' at him," An Niya instructed a female novice mage.

"Me?" Zhao Xu was shocked, looking at An Niya and the mage she was commanding, and took a moment to react.
