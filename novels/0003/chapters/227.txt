Chapter 228: Unexpected Encounter with a Classmate

As Zhao Xu walked out of the Mage Association, he directly turned invisible and hid in a corner, where he underwent a transformation.

When Zhao Xu reappeared, he had transformed into a priest wearing heavy armor, with a magic goddess's holy symbol pinned to his chest. The armor Zhao Xu was wearing was naturally created through his illusions.

Otherwise, the armor would not affect his divine magic, but as a two-circle mage, his magical failure rate would soar to 40%.

In his hand, Zhao Xu held a giant scythe, which had also attracted a lot of attention from passersby.

As Westervina's natural weapon was a wooden club, most priests would use weapons consistent with the gods, and rarely use special weapons like this giant scythe.

At this time, Zhao Xu was walking towards the city center square, where a swearing-in ceremony for players was being held. In fact, players had been clashing with local miners around the "Star Lake" area while completing tasks, so this time was no exception.

As Zhao Xu walked, he was also holding the giant scythe, trying to get familiar with its usage as soon as possible.

As a warrior in his previous life, Zhao Xu was skilled in various military weapons, including the giant scythe, which was also a dual-wielded close-range weapon.

According to the combat skills passed down by Arthur over the years, and quantified through the character card system, the damage curve of the giant scythe in Zhao Xu's hand was approximately 2D4 (2-8) damage, with an average expectation of around 5 HP damage per hit.
Here is the translation of the text:

This damage feature is not outstanding, but in the Arthurian combat technique heritage, there is a technique that is unmatched.

When the attack's execution level is extremely high, it can trigger a "crushing blow" technique that causes massive damage.

However, the difficulty of triggering this technique is not the same for different weapons.

Zhao Xu, holding a giant scythe, can only trigger this technique when his evaluation is almost perfect, i.e., 20 out of 20, and it is only triggered after a crushing blow threat.

Once triggered, it deals a quadruple damage, equivalent to Zhao Xu's attack dealing 20 HP damage without any additional effects.

It can be said that low-level players who are hit by Zhao Xu's crushing blow will definitely die.

However, Zhao Xu has to meet a prerequisite condition, which is that he does not actually possess this weapon.

For example, a mage or priest, with their profession training, only provides spiritual energy suitable for "light weapons", while a scythe like this is a "military weapon" that requires a specialized skill to master.

As for the Warlock, they do not have this problem because they can choose a war domain that allows them to master a specialized weapon and obtain a "specialized skill" in addition to their primary weapon.

Unfortunately, Xylara, a Warlock, is proficient in a wooden club, which is also mastered by mages, priests, and scholars.

Three times as proficient, without any additional effects.

However, as a mage, Zhao Xu, who has mastered all first- and second-tier spells, has various possibilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the past, Zhao Xu would quickly finish reading a book at the library using the "Touch of a Scholar" and then use this skill as a search tool.

Additionally, there is also the "Touch of a Master".

This minute-level spell of the mage can make him an expert in a weapon in a short period of time.

However, Zhao Xu had to prepare to use some magic before going to war.

Then, he could unleash his brilliance in an instant.

At this time, Zhao Xu had followed the crowd and walked to the city square.

In front of the square, there was a stone statue of the 13 founders of the Northern Alliance.

Originally, they were a group of adventurers who later became famous after completing the task of killing the demon king's avatar in the depths and defeating the dragon.

After that, the team settled down in the north and established the Northern Alliance, which continued to thrive for hundreds of years.

"Why, in this moment, can there be such a shameless thing as 'slavery'?"

On the stage in front of the statue, a poet dressed in luxurious attire was passionately recounting the "Lake of Fallen Stars" incident.

Immediately after, the team of adventurers who had experienced the "Lake of Fallen Stars" tragedy began to tell the story of what had happened, standing on the stage in front of the growing crowd of players.

At this time, besides the players who had come specifically to attend the event, many citizens of Winter City were standing still, watching the storytelling.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, a priestess of the goddess of good fortune, a girl with a clear and slightly short stature, was narrating the situation on stage. She described, in a voice trembling with emotion, the pitiful state of the slaves they had found in the underground pit. The description was simple and straightforward, directly conveying the slaves' hunger and exhaustion, as well as the lack of hope in their eyes.

As each witness took the stage, the atmosphere in the square reached a new peak. Zhao Xu, who had already heard this historical material, felt his emotions had stabilized. At this moment, he also felt the power of various skills piling up, which even influenced how he observed the world.

At least when he was listening to the speech, his "perception and observation" skill was automatically activated, like an intelligent AI, constantly analyzing and reminding him of the various subtle details of the speaker's behavior. Even before the speaker spoke out loud, he could predict what would happen next.

As for what the priestess was saying, Zhao Xu was even clearer about it. After the players were killed by the guards of the mine owners and returned, the slaves they had seen had already been slaughtered.

The last remnants of the slaves were erased.

This was the most brutal truth of King Arthur, only those with strong abilities could breathe and control their own destiny. Those without any abilities, level 1 commoners, could only flow with the crowd.

Even the residents of Arthur's city, who had been standing still, were mostly ordinary level 1 commoners, who, just like them, would only be able to find their lost children by giving money to the adventurers on stage and asking them to find their children. The adventurers of Arthur's city were ultimately a minority.
Here is the translation of the text:

The first batch of players who entered the game, including Zhao Xu, were the average adventurers. They were even more fortunate than those who did not enter the game. Compared to many of King Arthur's knights who had average attributes of 10 points each, they were much more fortunate and powerful. However, Zhao Xu suddenly realized a harsh reality when his "automatic detection magic" was activated. He saw that the in-game players were indeed extremely poor, with many of them not even wearing magical equipment. He looked around and saw that even the few warriors who were present were only wearing lightly armored suits and holding swords, listening attentively. Warriors who had completed their training could wear more defensive armor, such as heavy suits that provided 6-8 levels of defense. However, since they were poor, they did not have the means to buy such armor. Zhao Xu then noticed that his own transformed armor, which cost only 200 gold coins, was considered luxurious among the in-game players. He also recalled that the 1st-level mage "Rainy Night" had only a few bottles of "Light Wound" potions on him. Zhao Xu suddenly let out a deep sigh. As the former justice officer of "Star-Like Lake", he would hold a memorial service every year at the lake's monument. Therefore, he was certain that this incident occurred three days earlier than expected. In the past, he had wondered why the guards of the mining captains were similar in level to the players, and even more refined.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Even though the miners on the other side had a few three- and four-ring mages to support them, they were ultimately unable to withstand the pressure and were gradually being crushed. In the end, they had to use their lives to fill in the gaps and finally breach the stronghold of the miners.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt his detection skills being completely overwhelmed by the presence of everyone in the scene. He felt someone approaching him from behind. Zhao Xu's arm was slightly pressed against the giant scythe, preparing for a possible fight.

Just then, he heard a shouting voice behind him - "Xu ge"? However, Zhao Xu, who was mentally prepared, did not turn around impulsively. There were many bystanders around him.

As the footsteps drew closer, Zhao Xu felt his shoulder being tapped. He finally turned around, with a look of surprise on his face.

Standing in front of Zhao Xu was Zhang Qi, with several classmates from their class who were also playing games behind him. However, the female classmates from their class who were also playing games did not approach him, but stood at a distance. Including Cui Lu, they were all attracted to the scene because they didn't have classes today and had logged in early.

"Oh, sorry, I made a mistake. I thought my classmate should be in Floating Heaven, but suddenly he appears here," Zhang Qi apologized.

Zhao Xu simply responded, "It's okay."

At this moment, he, from his height to his facial expression, had undergone a transformation, and Zhang Qi naturally couldn't tell.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's gaze condensed, and his eyes looked to the left.

A fireball spell was rising into the air, flying towards a nearby location.

Is it targeting him?

No, it's a trap!
Zhou Xu reacted instantly, taking a step forward and charging straight ahead.
