Chapter 236: Divine Super Magic

Zhao Xu looked at his character panel and began to control the newly acquired potential points, exchanging them for the consumed spell slots.

The "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" spell, which he had obtained, would give him a small amount of potential points every turn, with the duration lasting only one turn. Therefore, he needed to use it in a timely manner to obtain the benefits.

Additionally, after 21 turns, Zhao Xu could use the "Miracle" spell to simulate the "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" spell and obtain new potential points, allowing him to achieve perpetual motion.

However, if that was the only way to achieve perpetual motion, Zhao Xu would not have needed to seek guidance from the legendary librarian, as advised by Anniya.

The rivalry between mages and priests in terms of equipment is often referred to as the "Enduring Magic" competition. For mages, achieving "Enduring Magic" requires a high level of progression, whereas priests can directly rely on "Divine Super Magic" to achieve the same effect.

In the future, Zhao Xu, who possessed the ability to create "Super Magic" and "Curse Magic" that could achieve "Enduring Magic" at a low or no cost, was currently following the shortcut of "Divine Super Magic".

The expertise of "Enduring Magic" is not suitable for all spells. Only spells with a fixed target, such as "Self" or a fixed distance, which cannot be dispelled instantly, can be combined with this expertise.
Zhao Xu attempted to learn the specialization "Perpetual Magic" from the beginning, but he struggled to memorize because the conditions were vague and numerous, deciding the fate of countless spells.

Even the most powerful magic is meaningless if it cannot be perpetuated. The cost of casting spells has become extremely precious in battle, and Zhao Xu had to pay a price of 4 spell slots and becoming disoriented for an additional "standard action" to cast a spell.

Not even the "Swift Burst" technique has a few qualified learners. After recalling the content, Zhao Xu remembered the "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" spell that can uncover hidden potential.

It was because of Anna's secret that Zhao Xu, in the "Final Scroll" space, was the first to simulate mastering this spell. Now, he wants to start using the "Sacred Super Magic" specialization.

According to Anna's words, only someone with unlimited spell slots is considered strong? That's just a long-lasting ordinary mage.

"Potential Points" not only restore spell slots, but also have another important function - simulating specializations.

Zhao Xu began to recall the details of the "Sacred Super Magic" recorded in the book. The various usage contents of specializations flooded his mind.

Actually, Zhao Xu wanted to simulate specializations, but he had to meet the prerequisite conditions first. "Sacred Super Magic" requires the consumption of "Dispersion Times", so the prerequisite condition is to possess the ability to "Dispel or Repel Undead Creatures".

Zhao Xu, being a level 1 priest, naturally met the prerequisite condition.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Other characters with potential points can also unleash their "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" and use their specialty, but they cannot abuse it like Zhao Xu does. Instantly, Zhao Xu consumed 1 temporary potential point in his mind.

Subsequently, a new specialty, "Endurance," appeared in his specialty list. This means Zhao Xu can use this specialty once in a short period of time. When the next "potential point" appears, Zhao Xu will immediately activate it.

At this moment, the specialty "Divine Super Magic" begins to manifest, quickly combining with the previous "Endurance" specialty to evolve into a new specialty, "Divine Super Magic (Endurance)".

Zhao Xu, seeing this spectacle, calmly uses his mastered level 2 spell, "Ghostly Strike!"

Ghostly Strike is a crucial spell for mages to deal damage. Its strongest effect is to make the wielder's weapon nearly invisible, like a transparent ghost. The weapon then gains the ability to ignore defensive abilities like armor.

Most adventurers rely on armor for defense. Mages are fragile and cannot wear armor, which affects their spellcasting. Zhao Xu once transformed into the "Fiery God Servant," which has over 30 levels of defense, including the 21st-level "Heavenly Shield." With this spell, the Fiery God Servant, even if it appears before Zhao Xu, has a defense similar to that of an ordinary person in terms of physical defense.

"Ghostly Strike" is the first spell that mages use to bully warriors.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it also has a fatal flaw - it can only sustain for one round of time.

So, the mage wants to use this spell to complete the casting and quickly close the distance to launch a melee attack.

But now, Zhao Xu directly activates the "Sacred Super Magic (Spell Endurance)" specialization in his hand.

Instantly, half of the "dispel count" is burned!

After reading the book, Zhao Xu only realized that the specialization itself also consumes one dispel count.

So, he had to consume 7 dispel counts to complete the "Spell Endurance" specialization's super magic.

Instantly, the 7 dispel energies disappeared from his panel.

Then, Zhao Xu saw a new hint appear in his dynamic panel:

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your "melee attack" is considered a "melee contact attack", ignoring armor and shield bonuses, duration: 24h.】

Directly covering the previous 6-second duration hint!

He succeeded.

From this moment to tomorrow morning,

Zhao Xu will hold the giant scythe, and all armor shields of enemies will be ignored by him.

His giant scythe can penetrate layers of defense and directly hit the enemy's body.

Zhao Xu will become the most terrifying assassin in the arena.

In fact, "potential points" can also be used to offset the super magic specialization.

Zhao Xu once consumed 3 potential points all at once to maximize the effect of "magic homing missile".

However, this approach requires him to provide potential points all at once, and cannot be paid in installments.

So, Zhao Xu uses the extra 1 potential point he gets each round to provide for the specialization that increases the effect of "spell silence" and "spell fixation" by one ring.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Like the 'Perpetual Magic' that requires 6 points of potential, it will directly clear out all his storage.

At this moment, Luo Duo looked at Zhao Xu, shaking her head and sighing: "Oh, the goddess forgive me, I've actually unleashed such a monster."

As she spoke, she almost knelt down like a nun, praying.

"Isn't it too exaggerated?" Zhao Xu said, using his sacred magic, revealing that he only had 3 times left to use his dispel, not enough for another use.

"After the great calamity, the Arthurian world made a pact, and from then on, 'Perpetual Magic' and related shortcuts will not be spread."

Luo Duo frowned, regretfully, "I never thought that I would only reveal this powerful tool to Zhao Xu just to show off my knowledge."

She had never realized that Zhao Xu had potential points.

Only Zhao Xu was different.

The first hurdle was learning a specialization.
The second hurdle was being able to learn it.
The third hurdle was having enough dispel times.
But Zhao Xu had the legendary library, lacking no channels.
He could simulate a specialization with potential points, without worrying about learning or not.
Next would come the third hurdle, which could be easily broken by potential points.

Some priests spent a specialization to learn "Extra Dispel" just to get an additional 4 dispel times.
It was unimaginable how difficult it was to obtain dispel times.

And now, Zhao Xu was still cheating with potential points - the third use of potential points, as said by Anniya, the true key to disrupting the balance of the world.

Recovering profession ability times!

Time went by, one round after another."

Note: I've kept the translation as precise and concise as possible, without any embellishments or creative liberties.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the duration of the spell was nearing its end, Zhao Xu didn't recover his spell slot, but instead used his talent points to restore his "dispel ability count"!
Because dispelling is a cleric's profession ability.
In the end, the originally exhausted dispel count, which was down to just three times, was restored to ten times through a 1:1 exchange at talent point 1.
Zhao Xu, much like the "Divine Super Mage" bridge, was able to do something that others who possessed talent points couldn't.
This means he can cast spells that last for 24 hours, turning a short-duration spell into a 24-hour spell.
Just like the "Super Natural Spell" ability of the Incantation Guardian, he can cast the "Prayer" spell without materials.
However, it's limited by the number of times he can cast it, with 4th-level Incantation Guardians only able to cast it once a day.
Anzio also relies on the talent point restoration of profession ability counts to do so.
At this moment, Zhao Xu finally felt that talent points were the core of this test account.
It's even stronger than dual elite professions.
Zhao Xu then continued to demonstrate various spell combinations with the "Spell Endurance" specialization.
He slowly accumulated Buffs on his body.
The only drawback is that he has to wait a minute each time to gather enough talent points to fill up the dispel count.
Zhao Xu thought about wasting a rare herb to get to the legendary library, and so chose to continue reading, absorbing the nutrients of the legendary library.
As he looked at the book, he slowly fell asleep.
He didn't wake up until the next day.
Zhao Xu suddenly woke up to find himself directly opening his eyes to see his dorm room's mosquito net, not the ceiling of the legendary library.
How did he log off?
As soon as he felt a sense of dizziness and numbness spread throughout his body. This was the exhaustion that came with excessive consumption. Zhao Xu slightly furrowed his eyebrows, directly took off his brain imaging helmet, and sat up. However, he was surprised to see that the sun outside was already quite fierce. He opened his phone to take a look. It was Saturday, 12:00 pm.
