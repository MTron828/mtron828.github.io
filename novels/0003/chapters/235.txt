Chapter 236: Divine Super Magic

Zhao Xu looked at his character panel and began to control the new potential points he had obtained, exchanging them for the spell slots he had consumed.

The "Unbridled Hero Spirit" spell, which he had obtained, would grant him a small amount of potential points every round, with the duration of the granted points lasting only one round. Therefore, this spell was suitable for those with obsessive-compulsive disorder, as they would need to use it in a timely manner.

Moreover, after 21 rounds, Zhao Xu would be able to use the "Miracle" spell to simulate the "Unbridled Hero Spirit" spell once again, replenishing his 21 new potential points.

This would allow him to achieve infinite motion.

However, if it were only this, Zhao Xu would not need to seek guidance from the "Legendary Library" like Anxena had told him.

The "arms race" between mages and clerics begins with "spell endurance". Mages want to achieve low-cost and easy-to-implement "spell endurance", which requires upgrading. Unlike clerics, who can achieve this through "Divine Super Magic" and bypass the need for upgrading.

For example, Zhao Xu, who would eventually possess "Super Magic Mastery" and "Super Curse Mastery" spells that could achieve "spell endurance" at a low or no cost, was now taking the shortcut of "Divine Super Magic".

"Spell endurance" is not suitable for all spells. Only spells with a fixed target of "self" or "fixed distance" and with a duration that cannot be cancelled immediately can be combined with this specialty.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu attempted to learn the "Enduring Magic" specialization, but he was forced to memorize because it was unclear and conditional, with countless magic spells at stake. Even if the magic was powerful, if it couldn't be sustained, it would be meaningless. Because the cost of casting would increase significantly during battles, which is extremely precious.

Zhao Xu had to pay a price of 4th-level magic slot and disorientation for an additional "standard action" to cast the spell. Even with such a cruel requirement, there were few who could learn the "Explosive Burst" spell.

After realizing this, Zhao Xu remembered the content he had just seen. He knew that there was a magic that could tap into his potential points, the "Unbridled Heroic Spirit" spell. This was because Anthenia told him the secret, so Zhao Xu went straight to the "Final Scroll" space and simulated mastery of this spell.

Now, he wants to start the second stage and start abusing the "Divine Super Magic" specialization. According to Anthenia's statement, only those with unlimited magic slots are strong? That's just a normal mage with a longer lifespan.

The "Potential Points" not only can restore magic slots, but also has another important function - simulating specializations. Zhao Xu began to recall the details of the "Divine Super Magic" record book.

The usage and content of the specialization flooded his mind. In reality, Zhao Xu wanted to simulate specializations, which also required meeting the prerequisite conditions. "Divine Super Magic" requires using "Dispelling" ability, so the prerequisite condition is to have the ability to "Drive Away or Kill Undead". Directly blocking the mage and the scroll outside the door. As Zhao Xu was a 1st-level cleric, he naturally met the prerequisite condition.
Here is the translation:

Other individuals with potential can also manifest the "unfettered hero's spirit" and use the "Divine Super Magic" skill, but they cannot abuse it like Zhao Xu does. Instantly, Zhao Xu consumed 1 temporary potential point from his brain.

Next, a new skill list appeared in his skill list, featuring the "Endurance of Magic" skill. This means Zhao Xu can use this skill once in a short time.

When the next "potential point" appeared, Zhao Xu immediately activated it. At this time, the "Divine Super Magic" skill began to manifest, rapidly combining with the previous "Endurance of Magic" skill to evolve into the "Divine Super Magic (Endurance of Magic)" skill.

Zhao Xu, with a calm expression, directly used the two-ring spell "Ghostly Strike" he had mastered.

As a key spell for mages to deal damage, "Ghostly Strike" can make the wielder's weapon almost invisible, as if transparent. Then, that weapon will have the ability to ignore defensive abilities such as shields.

Most adventurers rely on armor for defense. Mages, being fragile, cannot wear armor, which affects their spellcasting.

Zhao Xu, who had previously transformed into the "Fiery Heavenly Servant", possessed a defense of over 30 levels, most of which came from the 21st-level "Natural Shield". With this spell, the Fiery Heavenly Servant would be almost on par with ordinary people in terms of physical defense.

"Ghostly Strike" is the first trump card for mages to bully warriors.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it has a fatal flaw - it can only last for one round.

So, the mage wanted to use this spell to its fullest potential, and after completing the spellcasting, he quickly moved in to launch a melee attack.

But now, Zhao Xue is directly activating the "Sacred Super Magic (Spell Duration)" specialization handed to him.

Instantly, half of the "Dispelling Count" is burned out!

After reading the book, Zhao Xue finally knew that activating the specialization itself consumes one dispelling count.

So, he had to spend a total of 7 dispelling counts to complete the "Spell Duration" specialization's super magic.

And then, the seven dispelling energies suddenly disappeared from his panel.

Next, Zhao Xue saw a new prompt appear in his dynamic bar:

【Adventurer Zhong's "Melee Attack" is considered "Melee Contact Attack", ignoring armor and shield bonuses, duration: 24 hours.】

This directly overlapped with the previous 6-second duration prompt!

He succeeded.

From this moment until tomorrow, Zhao Xue will hold the title of the most feared assassin in the arena.

As long as he wields the giant scythe, all enemy armor and shields will be ignored by him.

His giant scythe can pierce through multiple layers of defense and directly strike at the enemy's body.

Zhao Xue will become the most terrifying assassin in the arena.

Actually, "Potential Points" can also be used to offset the super magic specialization.

Zhao Xue once used 3 potential points to achieve the maximum effect of the "Magic Missile" spell.

However, this method requires him to provide the potential points all at once, and cannot be paid in installments.

So, Zhao Xue uses the extra 1 potential point each round to provide for the specialization that increases the spell's duration and stability.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seems that a spell like "法术持久" that requires 6 points of potential will directly clear out all his storage when used.

At this moment, Lü Dōu looked at Zhāo Xù and could only shake her head and sigh: "Oh, Goddess, forgive me! I've actually unleashed such a monster."

She was about to kneel down and pray like a nun.

"What's so dramatic?" Zhāo Xù said with a holy and magical tone, revealing that he only had 3 uses left and couldn't use it again.

"After the great disaster, the Arthurian world had an agreement that they would no longer spread '法术持久' and related shortcuts."

Lü Dōu frowned and said regretfully: "I didn't think that I would accidentally reveal this powerful skill to Zhāo Xù, who only had it for show-off purposes.

She didn't discover that Zhāo Xù had potential points at all.

Only Zhāo Xù was different.

The first hurdle was learning a specialization.

If one couldn't learn it, it was the second hurdle.

And if one didn't have enough dispel times, it was the third hurdle.

However, Zhāo Xù had the legendary library and lacked no channels.

He could use "潜能点模拟专长" to simulate specialization and didn't need to worry about learning or not learning.

Next would come the third hurdle that could be easily broken by potential points.

Some priests spent one specialization to learn "额外驱散" just to get 4 more dispel times.

One could imagine how difficult it was to obtain dispel times.

And at this moment, Zhāo Xù was still using potential points to cheat again—

The third use of potential points, which was also the key to truly disrupting the world balance, as said by ānì Nǐ yǎ.

Restore profession ability times!
Time flowed by, round and round.

Here is the translation:

The duration of the spell was almost over, but Zhao Xū did not recover his spell slot, instead choosing to recover his "dispel ability" using his talent points. Because dispel is a priest's profession ability. In the end, the original 3 times of dispel ability, which had been consumed, was restored to 10 times through a 1:1 exchange at talent point 1. Zhao Xū effectively used the "Divine Super Magic" to directly achieve what others with talent points could not. This means he can cast spells that last for 24 hours instead of just a short period of time. It's similar to the "Super Natural Magic" ability of a 4th-level Prayer Keeper, which can be used without spell materials to cast a "Blessing" spell. However, it also has a limited number of uses, with 4th-level Prayer Keepers only able to use it once a day. Anzhiya also relies on recovering profession ability times using talent points. At this moment, Zhao Xū finally felt the true power of talent points. It's even stronger than dual elite professions. Zhao Xū then continuously demonstrated various spell combinations with his "Spell Endurance" expertise, slowly stacking buffs on himself. The only drawback is that he has to wait 1 minute each time to gather all his talent points and fill up his dispel ability. Zhao Xū thought it was a waste to use a rare herb to get to the legendary library, so he chose to continue reading, absorbing the nutrients from the legendary library. In this way, he sat reading, slowly falling asleep. He didn't wake up until the next day. Zhao Xū suddenly woke up, finding himself directly opening his eyes to the dormitory mosquito net, not the legendary library's ceiling. How did he log off?
He suddenly felt a heavy and hazy sensation all over his body. This was the feeling of exhaustion after a huge consumption. Zhao Xu slightly furrowed his brow, directly removed his brain-imagery helmet, and sat up. However, when he looked outside, he saw that the sun was already quite fierce. He opened his phone to take a look. It was Saturday, 12:00 PM.
