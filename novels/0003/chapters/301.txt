Chapter 302: Senior Investigator

As Zhao Xu thought, the Frost Sword had already arranged for the union members under his command to assemble the bamboo poles they had been carrying from the start, and then probe the muddy bottom to test the depth. At the same time, he arranged for the combat personnel to stand guard around the perimeter, prepared to defend against any possible attacks at any moment. It's undeniable that with a team of over 40 people, they can allocate personnel as needed.

The entire muddy area is longer and wider than 100 meters, a continuous stretch, although there is no unbearable stench. The only thing floating on the surface is the dry leaves that have just fallen. At this point, Zhao Xu judged that the muddy area in front of him was only about one meter deep. The four explorers responsible for finding the entrance to the stone room proceeded to wade into the mud, taking careful steps, each step preceded by probing the depth with the bamboo pole before taking another step.

As Zhao Xu was concerned about the stone room notes, although he thought it was a bit too coincidental, he was still confident that he would be able to get what he wanted. The only question was that when he saw the notes, he would have to refrain from asking for them, otherwise, anyone would think he was trying to monopolize the wizard tower. Zhao Xu was not nervous, as long as the location of the wizard tower belonged to him, then after the notes, the Frost Sword would still give them to him. Otherwise, Zhao Xu would be in trouble, no matter how many reasons he had.

So Zhao Xu had to ensure that they could enter that wizard tower, or else he would have no reason to ask the Frost Sword for the notes.

At this moment, the Frost Sword was looking at the worn-out, grayish-white sheepskin map in his hand, continuously directing the four explorers wading in the muddy area to move forward.
As they ventured deeper, the depth of the mud had already surpassed the chest level of the wanderers. The shore-bound warriors, who were known for their exceptional strength, began to grip the rope tightly. Suddenly, the lead wanderer exclaimed, "There's a raised platform!" He halted his advance, his step faltering as if he had kicked something. One of the wanderers drew their sword and stood guard, while another kept a safe distance to avoid any potential explosions. The other two adventurers focused on dismantling the sealed stone platform. However, the slightly raised stone platform, which was only about knee-high, would completely submerge their heads in mud if they crouched down.

In short, the wanderers' hands were not long enough, unless they had mastered the technique of using their feet to disable the mechanism. The shore-bound sword, who had heard the wanderers' feedback, furrowed its brow.

Initially, everyone had planned and conducted a simulation without considering this situation. Suddenly, even the reeds used for breathing were not prepared. "You want to try lifting your buttocks?" the sword suggested, giving risk advice based on everyone's opinions.

"Damn it, try lifting your buttocks yourself," the wanderer, Loot, complained after hearing this. At this point, he had already bent down to feel the distance from the stone platform.

"That mud is just right to cover our heads, it's a problem," Loot continued to say.

Zhao Xun, who had taken note of the magical record in his eyes, didn't want to deviate from the topic and directly asked, "If you grow taller, wouldn't your head be visible outside?"

"That's for sure," Loot shouted in response.

Just then, he felt a sense of unease. At the shore, Zhao Xu scattered a pile of iron powder and began to chant incantations. After he finished chanting the last syllable.

The iron powder, which had been scattered earlier, suddenly transformed into a deep, eerie light that attached itself to the body of the person, causing his entire body to begin to grow in size. His height and limb length increased proportionally.

Finally, after he had grown to around three meters tall, the transformation came to a stop. He looked at Zhao Xu with a bewildered expression.

"This is the 'Human Giant' technique, which allows you to transform into a large-scale creature," Zhao Xu said calmly, though he was a bit far away. "This way, you won't be washed away by the mud because of your short stature. Hurry up, it only takes five minutes."

Feeling the effects of the technique on his body, the person didn't dare to ask Zhao Xu about his height. He quickly bit his teeth and began to search the stone platform, looking for any hidden mechanisms or secret passages.

After a few minutes, the person suddenly looked thrilled and shouted, "I found it!"

The sudden movement was followed by a series of tremors, and the previously calm ground began to shake. Zhao Xu, who had been preparing to cast a spell, saw this scene and said, "Be prepared!"

As soon as something went awry, he would cast the spell.

In an instant, the entire mud pit was filled with a loud, rumbling sound, as if ancient gears had finally begun to turn. "Be prepared!" Frost Sword shouted.

With a quick motion, all the patrol members raised their longbows, pointing them directly at the few wanderers near the stone platform, as if they were the real enemies.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xū didn't show the slightest sign of nervousness. He had already experienced similar tactics in the underground temple, such as using mechanical devices to control the gates. The giant-like wanderer had already retreated slightly, as if he hadn't reacted to the sudden commotion.

At this moment, a cylindrical stone pillar, like a deep well, slowly rose from the muddy pool, revealing various rotting objects that made everyone present feel queasy. The pillar was surrounded by bricks, and its height was even higher than the people present, making it necessary to climb up to observe.

After the giant-like wanderer easily climbed up to the stone pillar, he opened the lid above the pillar using his research experience.

"There's a tunnel below the well," he said, then casually dropped a stone, and after a few seconds, the sound of the stone bouncing off the bottom of the well echoed through the air.

The well was very deep.

At this point, Shě Jiàn also realized the need to hurry, and he decided to enter the well with his team to explore the notes on the map.

He immediately followed his plan, arranging for his team to follow him down the well and into the stone chamber.

The wizard had left this chamber for future generations, and he didn't set any complex traps, so everyone wasn't too worried.

At this point, Zhao Xū also gave the signal to go down together, and Shě Jiàn, although slightly hesitant, agreed.

As a result, the team members who went down the well followed the initial safe route, slowly wading through the mud, and finally climbed into the stone chamber, accompanied by the giant-like wanderer, who also entered the chamber.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu didn't think much at this time, as the stone well was not far from him, so he directly drove his transmission boots and blinked his eyes, appearing on top of the well.

The players who were observing the situation were stunned, unable to believe that this madman, a wind mage, did not even bother to take a detour, but instead used his magic to speed up his journey.

When Zhao Xu arrived at the well, he noticed that the inner wall of the wellhead was made of bricks, with prominent stone steps that could be climbed slowly, step by step.

Zhao Xu then followed the people who had already climbed down, continuing to descend towards the bottom.

Finally, when he reached the last step, he found himself completely suspended in mid-air, over a wide room. He then let go and jumped down to the ground.

The room beneath the well was spacious, with walls made of bricks that were stacked neatly, without a single gap. It was hard to imagine that someone had built such a secret room a hundred years ago, hidden beneath the muck.

At the end of this spacious secret room was a similar stone door, which the two adventurers were staring at the lock of, looking puzzled.

"How's this?" Frost Sword asked.

"This has a trap, we have to wait until we've solved it," said one of the adventurers who specialized in unlocking and disarming traps, which was also the reason he had come.

After he finished speaking, he reached out to another adventurer and began to unlock and disarm the trap.

However, as time passed, the two adventurers' foreheads began to sweat more and more.

Until one of the adventurers stopped his hands, his face looking pale and exhausted, and shook his head, saying, "It's impossible to solve."

The onlookers were shocked, wondering how the trap could not be disarmed.

The trap had not been triggered, but it couldn't be disarmed either?

At this moment, Frost Sword was also getting anxious, as they had been surrounded and trapped, which was a very unfair situation.
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu, who didn't intend to make a big show of himself, walked up to the door that was blocked by a trap. At this time, another wanderer stopped and looked at Zhou Xu with a helpless expression, saying, "Crazy Wind, you're a mage, but solving the trap is something we wanderers should handle."

Zhou Xu didn't care and smiled, pointing to the trap that had never been triggered on the door lock and asking, "Can't you open it, but it won't trigger?"

The wanderer nodded slightly, and Zhou Xu shook his head, thinking that the mage was too fond of playing tricks on his descendants.

Just then, Chen Nu came up, thinking Zhou Xu wanted to force his way open, and shouted, "Breaking the stone door with brute force is impossible, unless you have a five-ring penetration technique."

However, Zhou Xu was delighted and said, "No, it's a two-ring shadow trap."

After saying that, Zhou Xu lightly brushed his backpack, and the mechanical trap on the stone door lock suddenly transformed and moved directly to his backpack.

The original trap on the door lock disappeared.

Zhou Xu didn't even bother to stretch out his hand to wipe it away, let alone that his spell target was his backpack the whole time. The entire process seemed like magic.

At this point, Zhou Xu's focus was no longer on the door lock. He clearly understood that he needed more dominance in the process that would follow.

He took out a proof certificate and said to the people present, "I am Crazy Wind, a senior investigator of the Rose Cross, responsible for investigating mysterious events in the secret temple. From now on, the process may require everyone's cooperation."

The Rose Cross is a secret organization responsible for investigating mysterious events on the ground, and is also the strongest force outside of the mage's shield.
Suddenly, the priest who believed in the goddess turned to Zhao Xu with a bow of respect. However, the players in the scene couldn't help but jump with excitement, as if they were top-level investigators. Are they intervening in the hidden task of Mistral? Is there a deeper secret to this wizard tower task?
