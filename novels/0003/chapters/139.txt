Chapter 140: Stacking Skills

Zhao Xu had analyzed the situation and concluded that the three people might be illusions, so when he saw them, his attention was already at its peak.

The three mages were basically half-naked, their robes torn to shreds by the thorns, with gaping holes all over their bodies.

Zhao Xu immediately raised his hand, preparing to cast a spell at these strange creatures.

However, the three mages, who were frantically trying to escape, were taken aback when they saw Zhao Xu and his companions. Their eyes widened in disbelief, as if they had seen something unbelievable.

The three mages, who had been desperately trying to run, suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

"Girl..." the three mages exclaimed in unison, but their voices were too soft for Zhao Xu to make out, sounding more like a dry cough.

The three mages then quickly turned around and scurried back to the depths of the forest, as if one of them was hiding a devil between them.

A chilling suspicion suddenly swept through the hearts of the three mages.

"One scene is like the aftermath of an avalanche on a mountain, where friends are saying that the girl's boyfriend has met his demise. But then the boyfriend suddenly appears, telling the girl that it's actually everyone who has met their demise, except for him, leaving the girl to choose who to believe in a cruel story."

Shadow sneered at the three mages' clumsy performance.

Meanwhile, LÃ¼ smiled warmly. "I believe that both Wind and Shadow are real people."

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, gazed off into the distance with a bad attitude.

This suspicious tactic is, of course, a familiar trick of mine.

It's not necessary to believe it; just prick someone with a needle and they'll believe it.

"Let's decipher this stele first," said Zhao Xu, who felt that it was better to settle some things early on.

At this moment, the three of them were squatting in front of the stele, gazing at the mysterious symbols below.

Typically, when encountering such situations on Earth, people would simply ignore the unknown content. However, Zhao Xu and his companions, the Arthurian wizards, used to connect to the source of knowledge to verify.

But this time, the process of connection itself had a probabilistic component, so the three of them did not dare to proceed with the interpretation rashly.

"Is it a language?" Zhao Xu speculated.

Arthurian languages were familiar to them, but there were also many other languages that were not well-known, even in other multiverse worlds. Just like Earth, which had hundreds of languages, but with limited styles.

"Definitely not one of the mainstream languages," said the observer, who had taken a look at the stele text.

"I have a scroll of the 'Tongue of Understanding' first-level spell in my hand, which can be used to read it," said Luo, adding, "However, I think this structure is not like a language at all."

The Tongue of Understanding spell was something Zhao Xu was familiar with, allowing people to understand and recognize languages they didn't know, effectively achieving the effect of a universal translator with a single-level spell.

As for being able to speak it out loud, that required a second-level spell, the Cunning Tongue spell.

"Then let's perform a knowledge verification of mysterious studies?" Zhao Xu gazed at the symbols on the stele, as if he had some impression, but couldn't quite remember it, and could only make this suggestion.

"We're not skilled enough in mysterious studies at our current level," the observer continued to emphasize.

Although Luo's knowledge of mysterious studies was similar to theirs, she was more solid in her learning.
Here is the translation of the text:

The prodigy who never forgets what they've seen is not going to be cheated anywhere.

"A person may be like that, but we have three people, don't we? We can show our data and provide our backup plan, and then concentrate it all on one person. Maybe we can change our fate that way," Ru Li said with a hint of happiness.

Zhao Xu listened and didn't think it was bad.

Now, the player who hears the backup plan is definitely scratching their head, wondering where it came from. However, the three of them are not the same.

"Knowledge (Mysterious) 5th level, +6 Intelligence adjustment," Li said first.

Zhao Xu looked at Li with an unwavering gaze, taking in Li's physical appearance, wondering how a human could have such attributes.

The +6 Intelligence adjustment meant that Li's current Intelligence was 22, which was higher than that of other players by at least 4 points. Even if Li had originally allocated 18 points to Intelligence at the beginning, it was still higher than that of other players by at least 4 points.

One +4 Intelligence headgear? That was already too luxurious, not to mention that everything was in a strictly controlled state.

Zhao Xu was convinced that Li must have at most one +2 Intelligence equipment.

As for the initial race, elves were only meant to increase agility and reduce physical strength.

So where did the remaining 2 points of Intelligence come from?

Zhao Xu was pondering this as he looked at Li's physique.

It wasn't until he thought about Li's eye color that a sudden realization struck him.

This world didn't just have him, the tester, in it.

It seemed that he had encountered a special race tester player, judging from Li's physical appearance and performance. It was likely that Li was one of those powerful, hidden human subspecies.

Zhao Xu could only sigh. When talent and testers combined, he felt like a reborn person was somewhat hollow.

"Knowledge (Mysterious) 5th level, +5 Intelligence adjustment," Ru Li said again.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu thought this condition sounded reasonable, and he was relieved that he could finally level up his knowledge skills. However, he still found it strange that he could only reach level 4, even with his vast knowledge domain. He had no idea how those two female mages had mastered such mysterious knowledge. His knowledge level was already high enough to crush most players. According to the forum statistics, among graduated mages, only about one-third had reached level 2 or higher in mysterious knowledge, because it required a lot of perseverance to continue studying in the game.

It was extremely rare for someone to reach level 2 in mysterious knowledge. As for other, less popular knowledge skills, it was even more rare for people to even know about them. "Mysterious knowledge level 4, +3 intelligence adjustment," Zhao Xu said, looking at the two women who were waiting for him.

He suddenly felt that his level 2 mage was a bit too weak. However, the data showed that mysterious knowledge had a +10 bonus, while Zhao Xu's was only +7.

"What's next?" the Shadow Investigator asked, inquiring.

"Wait a minute, there's a surprise," Lu said, pulling out a small, white-silver book from her bag, which was actually a dimension bag. She handed it to the two of them.

"This is the 'World Memory Scroll,'" Lu said. "If you read it for one minute, you can get a +5 performance bonus in the next knowledge test."

Zhao Xu looked at the small, white-silver book in Lu's hand, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of disdain for the exhausted mages who had spent a lot of effort to learn.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the book with three opportunities to increase knowledge and skills in one day, can it?"

The collector's eyes lit up as they eagerly flipped through the book's cover page.

For the collector, having such books with various magical abilities was almost the happiest thing in the world.

"Then, my mysterious knowledge and skills will reach 15 points," the collector said, looking at the stone tablet with confidence.

"Wait a minute," Zhao Xu said at this time, "hand over your intelligence headscarf first."

The collector listened to Zhao Xu's request, raised an eyebrow at him, but didn't stop moving, and took out her intelligence-enhancing "intelligence headscarf" from her cloak and handed it to Zhao Xu.

This also caused the collector's originally tied-up hair to fall loose.

Zhao Xu took it and directly pulled out a black rod from his backpack.

After he learned all the first-level spells, Anniya directly gave him a bag of spell materials, and then Zhao Xu put all the materials in the side pocket of his backpack, taking out what he needed as he went along.

After taking out the materials, Zhao Xu wrapped the rod and headscarf together and then began to perform the spell gesture as required.

This spell was one of the few that did not require incantation.

About six seconds later, the spell in Zhao Xu's mind directly transformed into energy and flowed into the headscarf through the black rod.

"Take it, and with it, you can also gain an additional +3 environmental bonus," Zhao Xu said.

At this time, Lu and the collector were both stunned by his action.

"How have I never heard of such a spell?" the collector asked in surprise.

"You don't know much," Zhao Xu smiled.
Here is the translation of the text:

This magic spell originated from other multiverse and was passed down by the first scholar who came to the Arthurian world. It was then secretly kept. This also means that few wizards mastered this spell.

"It's indeed quiet, but deep down, it's profound," said the shadow, slightly admiring Zhao Xu.

Luo also praised him, saying, "Wind, you've managed to learn and master so many spells in such a short time, it's truly remarkable."

In general, it's not scary, but someone who can spend a huge amount of effort to record and master a large number of spells can be considered an industrious genius.

Since Zhao Xu stood in the mysterious space beyond the final scroll, he learned spells at a rate of one per minute.

Even so, he still finished learning over 300 spells in just over five hours.

At this point, the shadow whispered the name of the "Revival" spell, which was more of a hint than an actual spell.

At this time, the shadow began to patiently flip through the "World Memory Scroll".

However, just a few seconds later, the shadow closed the scroll and handed it back to the female wizard, Luo.

"Isn't it just a minute?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No need, with a five-level knowledge skill, it can be done in just a few seconds," the shadow simply replied.

The shadow's attention was completely focused on the stone stele.

With his right hand, the shadow followed the scratches on the stone stele, starting to feel the passage of time and using it as a lever to activate the power of knowledge source.
After hearing the explanation from the shadow, Zhao Xu's evaluation of the small book was significantly improved. If it can be used in a short period of time, it would have strategic value.

It has almost reached the level of his "Knowledge Song" technique.

However, a while later, the shadow revealed a puzzled expression and said with a hint of regret: "I failed, just a little short, I should still have a chance."

"Alright, then it's up to you to try," the shadow said, handing over the headscarf that Zhao Xu had blessed to the shadow.

But the shadow shook his head and sighed: "No chance, actually, just a moment ago was the third opportunity for this book. It can only be restored tomorrow."

The atmosphere suddenly fell into an awkward silence.

"That's it, I'll do it," Zhao Xu said with a smile, showing his teeth.

As a mage with a spellcasting position, everything is possible.
