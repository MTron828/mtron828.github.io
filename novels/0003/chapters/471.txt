Chapter 472: Blood and Fire

"What's the point of being the daughter of the alliance leader, yet you don't use your power to destroy this filthy place and kill that evil person?" Fulei's voice grew increasingly low-pitched, as if Zhao Xu didn't notice the muscles bulging beneath her tight-fitting clothes, which seemed to be bursting with power.

"So, you're saying that this 'brothel' is actually one of the underground structures of the alliance?" Zhao Xu asked with a hint of sarcasm.

"No, I should say it's this entire area," Fulei replied.

At this moment, Fulei glanced at Zhao Xu with a wandering gaze, "Zhongxia, can I trust you?"

"From the moment you invited me here, you've already made up your mind, haven't you?" Zhao Xu answered.

"We players are least related to Arthur, as long as I've never appeared in Auror before, you don't need to worry that I'm not a spy of some big shot."

"Now that I'm in this position, you don't need to worry that I'll be bought off later."

Zhao Xu quickly pointed out the true intention behind Fulei's visit.

In the vast "Auror City", Fulei could mobilize tens of thousands of people, but to find someone to kill a big shot who had almost "gone public", it was really difficult to find a way.

If she missed this opportunity, she might never get another chance.

As time passed, the connection between the "player" and Arthur also deepened, and many noble and wealthy households began to appear with the "player's" traces.

The "player" had no connection to Arthur, and the connection would continue to dwindle.

"Zhongxia, please don't betray me," Fulei sighed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu thought for a moment, still didn't remind her to add the phrase "of trust" to the letter.

"Everything starts from before my birth," he said.

Fleur looked melancholy and said, "My mother, a noblewoman from a neighboring country, was kidnapped by human traffickers while on a trip and was eventually sold into slavery. As for Tang De, he was a guest here when he was young, but I was born prematurely, so he didn't know I was his daughter until later."

"If he wasn't sure he wouldn't have an heir, I would be considered a mere pawn even if I was his illegitimate daughter," she said.

"Even now, he still sees me as a tool for a strategic marriage. He might give me to his friend Du Ka Luo, or even marry me off to someone else."

As Zhao Xu heard this, he couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.

It seemed he had underestimated Fleur more than he thought.

Although Fleur had always respectfully addressed Tang De as her father when they first met, after revealing the truth, she had started calling him by his name and her tone was filled with disdain towards her "stepfather".

As Zhao Xu thought back, his pupils dilated slightly. He remembered the past and suddenly it all made sense.

It seemed Fleur had been plotting against him and Zheng Xin An from the start. She had deliberately arranged for him to go to Auroria City, which was the beginning of it all.

No one could have predicted that Zhao Xu's family would suffer a major setback, causing Fleur to be unable to bear the thought of dragging him into it anymore.

Each time Fleur mentioned Tang De's paternal affection, she would put on a fake smile, but beneath it was how much resentment she felt.
After my birth, it was only natural that I became the property of the fiery red-lipped woman. Behind the scenes, Kurouze, the mastermind, had brought in the fiery red-lipped woman and the most prominent courtesans of the pink peach, instructing me in the art of becoming a noblewoman. Even the nobles' mistresses were summoned to teach me how to dress like a noblewoman.

Suddenly, Fleure's demeanor changed dramatically.

The cautious posture transformed into a refined and elegant noblewoman, complete with impeccable etiquette, as if she was showcasing her past accomplishments. Even if she were to change into a different dress, there would be no sense of incongruity. She was no longer the carefree and playful girl she once was.

"This is all part of the plan to present myself as a 'virgin dessert' to be served to the high-ranking officials once I'm a bit older," Fleure said, recounting her past, her eyes cold and expressionless, as if she weren't telling her own story.

"Criminals," Zhao Xu sneered, his disdain for the trifles evident in his tone. As the former town magistrate, he had dealt with cases involving confiscated evidence and was not one to underestimate the importance of a life of luxury.

"I didn't know what kind of life that was back then," Fleure said, her voice devoid of emotion. "I only found it strange that the maids would gather around to watch me receive instruction, and even my mother seemed to dislike seeing me learn. It's only now that I understand she was disgusted by her own past self."

Hearing Fleure recount her past in such a detached manner, Zhao Xu couldn't help but assess her mental state. He believed she didn't have suicidal tendencies. Perhaps this flashback was a long-suppressed secret deep within her heart, and Zhao Xu needed to delve deeper to understand her. Otherwise, he wouldn't dare agree to her requests.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu boasted that he would forge the sharpest sword in Asia, but it didn't mean the sword would be wielded by someone. "It was around the time I was about to turn eight or nine years old when I was sent to a nobleman's manor. It was a place where one couldn't even speak loudly for years. Now, thinking back, I was destined for a miserable fate of being exploited. But my poor mother stood up at that moment."

"In this fiery-red-lipped woman who had been struggling for ten or so years, even a maid wouldn't dare offend her, fearing that one day she would be punished for her age and beauty. She had been imprisoned, starving to the point where even the insects and rodents in the walls were eating each other, and had been brutally treated by guests, leaving her with scars that would never heal. But in that instant, she still spoke up for me, her only daughter."

"She suggested that they go together, saying that it was uncertain whether it would be more effective in stirring up that corrupt nobleman. So she recommended to Kuroze that she accompany me."

"At that time, Kuroze looked down on her disdainfully, but after she crawled over, he broke her legs with the wooden stick in his hand and said, 'This will make the guest more satisfied.'"

At this point, Freya's eyes were already filled with tears, and tears began to flow down the edge of her mask.

"This is how we were escorted out of the city by a heavily guarded cart. But Kuroze guessed wrong by a hair's breadth. My poor mother, who gave birth to me, had unleashed the magical bloodline within her at the moment she gave birth to me. This innate talent allowed her to become a 1st-level mage, but she had been afraid of being detected all those years and had suppressed the last shred of hope, so she didn't dare to advance."

Note: Freya is a character in the story, but in this text, she is not the main character.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When guests who are familiar with powerful magic come, my mother is not lacking in her ability to understand their level of magical proficiency. However, every time she encounters such guests, she is delighted because she can learn more about the secrets of magic through casual conversations and increase her chances of escape. But she has never taken action.

Or, to be more precise, when I was born and saw the unfortunate fate of being born into this wicked world, she had already prepared to upgrade her magic and leave me with the opportunity to take advantage of the 'information gap'. It's funny that even with plenty of magical equipment, she couldn't help but remove them all when she was on that luxurious bed with that old man. She was paralyzed by a spell and couldn't even grip his hand.

But by then, my mother had already lost her legs and couldn't escape. At that time, she coldly told me about her past and said she had never liked me, but had brought me to this world, so this time she had come to repay the debt.

Then, that silly woman lit the fire, causing chaos, and only then could I escape. That night, my mother died, and I grew up.

By now, I've calmed down. After that, as a young girl, I had nowhere to go and had to wander into a bandit organization, where I became a vagabond. But since I'm naturally mediocre, I didn't have the strength to seek revenge. So I need to return to where Tangde is, and I want to use this power to make myself strong and ultimately kill everyone involved in this matter.

My story is over."

Zhao Xu also nodded silently.

Some people even consider death, not wanting to burden others with their emotions.

He gazed at the "Flaming Red Lips" mansion ahead, the night growing darker, and the guests who had been hidden for a long time emerging one by one."
Here is the translation:

"When you were brought back, didn't your experiences in this courtyard become known to others? So, if something happens to the other party, you won't be suspected, right?"

Flore smiled coldly, "This courtyard is said to be hiding many secrets of Oloru City. Not to mention human trafficking, just the number of wives and children of officials who were imprisoned for crimes or died in battle far exceeds your imagination."

"I'm one of those who want to kill Koruze, but I won't be ranked first. As long as I don't use my public power, no one will suspect me."

Zhao Xu listened and couldn't help but look at Flore again, hearing the subtle hint.

"Is Koruze your ultimate target?"

"He? That old dog who has been puffed up is the culprit, but not the only one. I'm seeking revenge against all the forces involved, including those who started the human trafficking of my mother."

"But my sword will first point to him. I want to make this evil underground force watch their comrades die one by one, and make them tremble with fear in the shadow of death."

Flore wiped away tears from the corner of her eye, "I know the cost of hiring a wizard. You need anything else, and I'll give it to you, including myself."

"Alright."

Zhao Xu re-checked his equipment, confirming that he was at the peak of his combat power.

"Shall we go?"

"Yes?"

Flore was surprised, as Zhao Xu faced the blazing red lips in front of him.

"Are you crazy? I hope you can kill for me, but not die for me. We'll take revenge, but we'll do it wisely. I invited you here because only by seeing this courtyard filled with evil can I muster the courage to talk about my past."

"But it's not what I want you to do tonight."
Here is the translation:

"I've endured for ten years and don't mind enduring for another ten years."

Just now, Floria, who had just finished crying, was still a bit out of breath. "Zhongxia, I know you've obtained the divine artifact, but once you use it or the method you used to kill those ambushers like the ones you killed at the night of the Ascension of the Heavenly Palace, you'll definitely be exposed. The black veil of the Oracle City will only be grateful that you've shown a weakness that can be attacked."

"I'll ask you one question," Zhao Xu asked. "Is Kuruzo inside?"

Floria nodded vaguely.

"That's settled then," Zhao Xu said, patting Floria's shoulder like a big brother. "Trust me, a wizard's methods are far beyond your imagination."

After that, he looked back at the mansion with red lips and red lanterns.

"This place has no need to exist."

"Whoosh." A loud sound echoed, and two "demonic statues" were thrown into the sky, drawing a bright and beautiful color.

Oracle City, Night of Blood and Fire.
