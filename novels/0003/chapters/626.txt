Chapter 627: The Powerful Template of 100 Gold Coins

Zhao Xǔ, seeing the crowd's interest, suddenly became enthusiastic and analyzed directly: "From a fundamental perspective, it's a template for a charge-type character card, with strength first, and physique second."

"What about agility?"

"Agility mainly enhances defense, but fundamentally because the charge-type sacrifice defense will sacrifice too much. In the subsequent resources, defense is sacrificed to enhance attack, so it's easy to waste resources even if you stack it high."

At this point, Zhao Xǔ felt a sense of helplessness.

In fact, his explanation is more suitable for explaining to players who can register their own character roles. However, it's too late for that now. Even if people want to change their attributes, it's too late to turn back.

In the past, there were many posts on the Arthur game forum about the direction of character cards, and ordinary people would definitely be confused if they didn't know how to proceed.

Moreover, players are all looking at the current strength of their profession from the perspective of 1-5 levels.

Therefore, in the early stages of the game, it's okay to play a bit carelessly, warriors can fight, rogues are decent, and mages are mediocre. It's only when characters appear at 6-9 levels that people realize that professions can be divided into early, middle, and late stages.

However, to carry a team to the late stages, it's definitely easier to make mistakes in the early stages.

Many posts exist, but few can be relied upon. A hastily written post may determine the strength of a character's future.

After crossing the bridge, everyone has lost the opportunity to re-register their account and start over.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's familiar voice was spreading, reaching every cave mouth, and countless listeners were writing down his words in real-time. Even before crossing over, the Earth's communication network was unparalleled, but no one had ever broadcast live discussions on such topics. Suddenly, countless cave mouths erupted in chaos.

Those who had come to this place in these turbulent times were either groups of guards who had arrived in an official capacity or teams with actual abilities, determined to take risks. Compared to ordinary civilians, they had the ability to achieve what Zhao Xu had said, and in a world where the warrior occupation accounted for 90% of the population, Zhao Xu's words were especially relevant.

Some people even decided to take action on the spot, and even recommended their children and relatives to follow in their footsteps. "Do you have a pen and paper? Where's the old wizard?" "Don't be silly, all the wizards have been mobilized, who would waste their time arranging to be here?" "What are you waiting for? Just grab a sword and carve out the key points on the mud, just like we did when we first crossed over, it's only been a few days."

In an instant, every cave mouth where a non-undead being had crossed over was plunged into a chaotic scene, with some people singing and others taking center stage, with the price of paper in Luoyang being high, and everyone was copying and waiting for the "true transmission" from Zhao Xu.

Inside the dark cave, the space was narrow, the walls were hard, and the fire was barely maintaining its brightness. Sitting opposite Zhao Xu were tens of pairs of expectant eyes, even they were struggling to figure out how to record everything honestly, but couldn't bring themselves to do so.

Zhao Xu, who didn't care about any of this, continued to speak, "Although it's already too late to change things."

Apart from rebirth spells, prayer spells, and tribal rituals, etc.
Here is the translation of the text:

"However, we can still analyze the racial selection aspect. Humans are the optimal choice, and the elf's racial adjustment is to lose 2 physical attributes and gain 2 agility. It's not too meaningful for charging forward. Dwarves lose 2 charm and gain 2 physical attributes, which looks profitable, but being born with short legs is not suitable for the role of charging forward.

On the other hand, half-orcs and orcs increase their strength, which is quite realistic, especially orcs can increase 4 strength at the cost of -2 in all three attributes. However, it's too costly.

At this point, a female mage raised her hand and said, "Isn't it that orcs are not initially chosen?"

Players listening to the live broadcast outside the cave also thought of this point, with some even being surprised.

Zhao Xu nodded, "Yes, there have been cases where players have crossed the ice and received blessings from the opposite orc empire, successfully converting to an orc player. However, I've also heard of people becoming the Stoneborn tribe, with a +4 strength and +2 physical attributes, a larger physique, and an added jump bonus."

"There are also the Wildborn tribe with their flying ability, which is quite impressive. Of course, if you don't care about appearance, there are also centaurs and lycanthropes."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he felt the atmosphere becoming increasingly strange.

In the early Arthurian period, most players chose from the core races.

Unless it's like Zhao Xu's dual-elite account, the number of sub-races and other rare races in the seven major races is not many.

However, this does not hinder the fact that Earth humans have spread to other tribes through various magical means such as reincarnation and racial ceremonies.

At this point, it's hard to bring up the topic of charging forward, and Zhao Xu naturally wants to highlight the suitable 'charging flow' race."
As soon as his words fell, more than ten people in the narrow cave seemed to hear the voices of countless people outside, and they directly asked, "Mr. Zhongxia, do these winged, centaur, and beastly people have crucial special abilities?"

Zhao Xu looked at the campfire in front of him, which seemed to represent the inner thoughts of the crowd, and said with a smile, "Because they are also related to the specific schools of the charging system. For example, the winged people are suitable for the diving flow, while the Galia represent the jumping and chopping flow."

"As for the centaur, just the racial adjustment alone adds +2, which means a level 1 warrior centaur is equivalent to a level 3 human warrior in terms of upgrade difficulty."

Like the "perfect human" Zhao Xu had encountered before, which had already been acquired, leveling up was like that of a character at level ten or higher. On one hand, it was due to the excellent template, and on the other hand, it was due to the difficulty of leveling up in the future.

Even if someone were to kill the opponent, the life energy they could harvest would be similar to that of a monster at level ten or higher.

"However, choosing a centaur is worth it. Strength +8, Agility +4, Constitution +4, Intelligence -2, Perception +2. Also, due to the centaur's characteristics, charging with a spear is equivalent to riding and charging with a spear, and it's not weak at all. It's the same as the beastly people, although their racial adjustments are also high, the increase in strength is also very good."

Listening to Zhao Xu's words, everyone suddenly felt a sense of enlightenment, and they also realized that they had underestimated the importance of strength.

As for the audience outside, they were all focusing on the "diving flow" and "jumping and chopping flow," desperately pondering whether there were extremely crucial elements in them.

At this time, the young warrior Ma Yufan said with a slightly bitter tone, "Brother Zhongxia, what you said is something we cannot access, even if there really is a chance to change our race in the future, I'm afraid that everyone may not want to change."
Zhao Xu's description at this time may be the most inappropriate for ordinary people, and the hundreds of years of life of the elves are more attractive. In fact, when countless players outside the cave heard the words of these races, they were also shouting for more exciting content, hoping that Zhao Xu would quickly move on from the topic of races. Little did they know, Zhao Xu's gaze was only focused on a segment in his mind. After thinking for a while, he decided to release it. It just so happened that he was going to the Icefield Mountains to meet the mysterious black dragon, so it would be a good idea to use the following method to form a powerful assault legion. Not to mention, with each additional race, the dragon god Tyamat would have gained another enemy. Zhao Xu didn't mind stirring up some trouble for his "potential" enemies. At this moment, he revealed a meaningful smile, which even appeared to be filled with anticipation in the glow of the campfire, arousing everyone's curiosity. From the deep breaths coming from the outside, people could feel the solemn atmosphere at the scene. "Next, I will mention the final trump card of this 'race chapter' of the assault legion, which is also a means that will disrupt the balance." "After going out, I will provide this means within the territory of Yanan's forces, and voluntary applicants will be selected based on merit." Although the target audience is only a dozen people, it will do. When they meet the main force later, these people will help spread the content. This means that most of Yanan's forces at this time will be able to hear this message. This is the reason why Zhao Xu is advertising here. Watching Zhao Xu tease everyone like this, the hearts of the people who had already dropped were suddenly lifted, and they looked at him eagerly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is a template that does not require giving up your original race, as soon as you transform, you can perfectly adapt to the charge flow, or say a special race template."

"One day, after successful transformation, you are still human, but your lifespan limit can be increased to over 400 years."

"What is it?" The boy's eyes flashed with an unusual brightness, and other players who did not choose the high-lifespan race were equally envious, as if they had caught a very affordable "anti-aging method".

"The price is 100 gold coins, and you only need to join the virtuous camp."

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already mentally noted the true bug of this template in his heart.

You can inherit the attributes of your original race, such as the 8 points of a human, and will not lose them. However, you can eliminate all racial characteristics, such as not needing to fear strong light as a beastman and not being dizzy in bright sunlight.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu ended the final suspense—

"Summoning Bahamut."
