Chapter 279: The Divine Fragment's Effect

After experiencing being deafened by the Grim Reaper's punishment, Zhao Xu had mentally prepared himself for this situation. At this moment, he was feeling the loss of all sounds around him, while also thinking about the source of the "divine secret".

He even speculated that this might only be limited to the Grim Reaper's secret.

It wasn't until the third round that Larksa continued to speak to Zhao Xu, saying, "Master, have you recovered?"

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied.

"This state is quite troublesome, so I'll continue to say it." Larksa said. "In the past, the Grim Reaper had a conflict with the 'Soul Empire' before becoming a god. This is also the reason why the Grim Reaper was later imprisoned in this half-plane."

"This half-plane initially served as a breeding ground for 'carnivorous beasts' by the Soul Empire, and later became a prison. The special structure within almost eliminated the possibility of escape or bribery. Therefore, it is usually used to imprison heavy offenders."

Larksa looked at Zhao Xu as she spoke, her voice accompanied by a melodious and lighthearted tone, which added a rhythmic quality to her words.

"So, did the Mage Association at that time have a legendary mage who protected the Soul Empire?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked, noticing that the Mage Association had intervened in this plane more than necessary.

Not to mention creating a half-plane, which would involve the level of legendary magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah," Laxus replied affirmatively, "the founder of the Sorcerous Empire, who was originally a wizard, helped his son establish the empire. And from then on, everyone knew that the Sorcerous Empire was backed by a powerful force."

"The Sorcerous Empire has been breeding those corrupted beasts, and it's said to be related to the worship of their ancestors."

"What exactly happened?" Zhao asked curiously.

"It's said that it's related to that legendary wizard, Xylara. He revealed a secret to the Sorcerous Empire, and they captured Lord Nal, who was still a noble at the time, and tortured him. They even destroyed his family."

As Laxus spoke, he seemed to be lost in thought.

"Who knows, but Lord Nal never revealed the secret during the torture, until one day he just vanished."

"Later, Lord Nal reappeared, and although he had not yet become a god, he had already gained immense power and destroyed the Sorcerous Empire with a single blow."

"Apparently, a meeting was arranged to discuss the details, but no one expected that Lord Nal would attack Xylara with his undeveloped godly power and kill him in this plane."

"...and then he imprisoned Xylara's soul as the will of this plane."

When Laxus finished speaking, Zhao was taken aback.

It seems that this plane has been under the control of a legendary wizard who has lost his physical form.

However, Zhao didn't look back or try to communicate with the plane at that moment. It's no wonder that this plane eventually fell into the hands of the Wizard's Association and became a fixed arrangement for the "Iron Will" plane.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's no wonder that Luxia just said that this plane is a shame for the Association of Mages. A large organization like that, which can't even protect its own high-ranking mages or legendary strong individuals, is bound to have great dissatisfaction. Therefore, when the Association of Mages launched an attack on Death, they sent a team to do it, even though it didn't concern them.

At this time, Zhao Xu also realized that the "Sleeping Land" in front of him was brought by another half-plane.

"Can the will still exist after the half-planes merge?" Zhao Xu asked simply.

Luxia continued to add, "Indeed, the planes will officially merge in a few days. If this legendary mage has lost his last foothold, he may be able to get eternal rest. So, we should leave before the official merger."

"King Qingwei and Eiswich are hiding in the town below, and this place didn't belong to the half-plane that controlled it, so the Association couldn't use the legendary mage to transfer it."

Just then, Zhao Xu noticed that the "Casket of Amber" in the sky was flying towards the direction of the Death God's temple mentioned by Luxia.

Zhao Xu looked at the rear of the team and thought about his own strength.

The current situation is that, in the short term, the will of this half-plane, which was once the legendary mage, is on their side. They will return to the material plane of Mistral through the arrangement of the other side.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until the sorrowful melody in front of him came to an end, the amber coffin had completely immersed itself in the temple, and the undead creatures surrounding it had begun to take action. Zhao Xu then quietly concluded his calculations and prepared to infiltrate the city.

"Rakshasa, you said that if you become a divine artifact, you can touch the 'amber coffin' and get some divine power out of it?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

"Yes, master, as long as you give me a head start, I can touch the 'amber coffin' and even get some divine power out of it without opening it," Rakshasa said proudly.

Zhao Xu was clear about his current state and felt the divine power, but he was unlikely to accept the divine rank.

"That divine fragment will only be useful after I become a legendary hero?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No, master, I told you, I can rely on this fragment to start developing my followers," Rakshasa said.

"Followers?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Yes, master, we can use it to disseminate divine abilities, but it will definitely be less powerful than the true divine abilities, and the number of people who can grant divine abilities is limited. Even the master himself is limited by his level," Rakshasa said.

At this point, Zhao Xu had already begun to think ahead.

Although he couldn't rely on the "divine rank" to become divine, he could use Rakshasa's divine artifact identity to simulate the effects of divine power and give himself a divine identity.

In other words, he could pretend to be a priest and grant blessings to those who looked up to him, a private blessing that was only available in the legendary realm.

The power of this cheating was a bit excessive.

Even the balance of the scales was not yet enough.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yeah, and also, as the master, you're not willing to use that legendary spirit staff, right? Logically, you must be reluctant to use it. But with my existence, I can rely on divine power to charge that staff, which is equivalent to you obtaining an infinite-energy 'legendary spirit scepter'."

Even if Lirks says it lightly, it directly reveals a strong possibility. That is, Zhao Xu may be able to play the role of a spirit master based on that staff. That staff can summon undead creatures, so Zhao Xu is like fighting with summoned creatures when completing some tasks, and he won't be too weak.

For example, today's situation, he can't even solve the problem with a few fireball spells.

"Hey, Lirks, shall we go take a look at that temple?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Yeah, sure, master. The temple can't be on high alert 24/7. Once a gap appears, we'll take advantage of it immediately."

"That's indeed possible to consider," Zhao Xu said, relying on Lirks' shape-shifting artifact for a sudden attack. After Lirks absorbs the energy, Zhao Xu will have to hurry and retreat with the shape-shifted Lirks.

Even they need to quickly teleport away.

The entire pace is extremely tight, with no room for hesitation.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's gaze also turned to the town below, "Let's enter the town ahead."
