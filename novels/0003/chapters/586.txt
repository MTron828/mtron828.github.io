Chapter 587, Level 10

Zhou Xu also had some suspicions about his past.

He suspected that in this "memory" of the past, he saw another Zhou Xu wearing the "Celestial Garb" and "Great Sage's Robe", holding the "Talisman of Power" and the "Staff of Law".

Perhaps at that time, he had become a legendary mage, and in the unreturnable realm of King Arthur, he went back in time to try to change his past.

Or maybe his "time travel" was destined to happen in the future.

In the end, Ernest established a vast magical empire and then disappeared from this magnificent world of King Arthur.

Except for a few ancient gods who managed to survive, such as the dragon god Thima, Bahamut, and the miserable lady, who was stationed in the Memory City and transcended the gods.

Most of the living beings were extinguished, and even the divine systems underwent several transformations.

Ernest's "portrait" or "statue" did not leave a single version or remnant.

He seemed to have deleted all the traces that could prove his existence, leaving only his "name" to be passed down among the mage community.

Zhou Xu was not too arrogant.

Only from Anxiony to May, he was so fond of him.

And countless strong individuals, from the ancient elemental gods in the depths of the Star Lake, such as Moszelelin, to the Overlord of the Abyss, Gralt, did not fail to find an anomaly in his destiny, demanding a "promise" from him.

Even if Zhou Xu remained calm and composed, he knew that he was indeed extraordinary.

Although he kept his emotions hidden, he showed no signs of turmoil.
Here is the translation of the text:

Deep down in his heart, a hint of "pride" is bound to emerge.
Perhaps, he is the "Ernest" of history.
Until this moment, Zhao Xu lifted his eyes, staring at the other person, as if he was staring at another version of himself.
He saw the originally dark night sky distorted by a kaleidoscope of colors, forming an abstract and non-linear oil painting with a somber and melancholic tone.
Like the ruins of a broken castle, the weak and invisible streetlights cast a long shadow of a pedestrian.
The shadow covered Zhao Xu's body, as if it was suffocating him.
Then, the empty space before him seemed to be distorted by a funhouse mirror, and everything became distorted and strange, impossible to look at, and the shadow suddenly disappeared.
Zhao Xu couldn't see "Ernest" anywhere.
Not even the original May that stood before him disappeared, and he couldn't find any trace of it.
"Can you recognize me?"
Suddenly, the formerly quiet space was filled with a profound and mysterious sound, like waves crashing, and suddenly there was a flash of insight.
Zhao Xu turned around, but he couldn't see anything unusual.
In his eyes, multiple versions of "secret vision" flashed, and the only thing he could see was the "blinding" light ahead, like staring directly at the sun at noon, which would cause his eyes to water after one second.
"I..."
Zhao Xu wanted to speak, but he couldn't find the words.
He couldn't even see clearly!
"Sorry, this time I've broken through, and the residual energy of my eleven-ring technique has not been absorbed yet. Therefore, you cannot see what's in front of you."

Here is the translation:

"It's because the world I just left is too dangerous, so it's not necessary to use such means to protect oneself, or one might be destroyed by an external force without noticing."

As he spoke, a mysterious voice from the void revealed a hint of surprise, "I've already sensed the magical energy of this world. It's indeed a very ordinary feeling, and it's truly a world where mortals are incredibly happy."

However, Zhao Xun's expression was one of shock and bewilderment.

Eleven Rings!

This is not referring to the kind of ring that occupies the eleventh ring position through the use of super magic. Essentially, it's still a nine-ring magic.

The terminal of the nine-ring magic is the legendary magic.

It was once that Zhao Xun was squatting in the legendary library of the floating city on a quiet night, borrowing a book that the librarian refused to lend out, titled "Secrets of Legendary Magic".

The book recorded a segment about the introduction of legendary magic, which is also a publicly known fact.

It's said that a "dream-like" power, a mysterious power that is inspired by prayer and defined by the practitioner themselves.

According to rumors, every legendary magician who enters the realm can see the true power of the multiverse, which is filled with sharp, fiery red, endless black, and vibrant orange shadows.

At that moment, legendary magicians' minds are surrounded by countless magical secrets written in forgotten arcane scripts, but they can understand them without any obstacles.

Furthermore, countless magicians have never pursued something, but for the first time, they spread out before them like truth, telling each legendary magician who has reached the hall - reality is a fragile thing.

This collection of powers that surpass ordinary magical knowledge can only be opened by those who have reached the hall.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only in the margins of ancient tomes and in the whispers of elderly wizards of the wizarding association can one hear of a magical art that transcends the abilities of ordinary people - the legendary magic. In the Dragon language, it is referred to as "the power of dreams." Regardless of how it is referred to, it is the next level and the final level of magic for legendary wizards. Executing legendary magic is not easier than changing the material reality, even for gods, when faced with a legendary wizard who can perform legendary magic. This is the manifestation of legendary magic in the world of Arthur.

However, there is a genuine existence of the Eleven-Ring magic outside of legendary magic. Is legendary magic a collective term for the tenth ring magic, or is it a pure magic system? Is the Eleven-Ring magic a magic power that far exceeds legendary magic? Does a solo tenth ring magic exist? This has been swirling in Zhao Xu's mind.

Even the questions raised by the former King of Wizards, Arthur, have been forgotten. Moreover, he cannot even listen to the mention of the web of magic and external gods. At this moment, Zhao Xu is no longer capable of thinking too much in this desolate and gloomy atmosphere.

"Ah, what a pity," the voice behind the curtain said again, but this time Zhao Xu heard the heavy sighs of regret. "If you really traveled back to that moment in time, how wonderful it would be?"
Ernest, who was behind the curtain, sighed, "I'm just a memory of the past, and I can't turn back the clock." "Perhaps, in the future, Arthur would not have turned out this way."
At this point, Ernest's words had exceeded Zhao Xu's understanding range, and even trying to understand was difficult.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, he can be certain that the Ernest consciousness in his memory realized that he was actually existing within the memory, having extended his independent consciousness.

Just like the characters in a work, he became aware that he was a part of a work.

"Anyway, I still have to thank you for letting me know everything about the future development in this memory. Although it cannot change the past, knowing that I didn't make a mistake is enough."

At this moment, Ernest's inner monologue had synchronized with the low murmurs around him, bit by bit, and even synchronized with this world.

Even the next moment, Zhao Xu's mouth opened and closed automatically, mimicking this sound.

He was slowly being assimilated by another will.

This sense of fear made Zhao Xu wake up, and he quickly switched to prepare to exhibit his magical powers, such as the blessings of the martyrs, to resist the discomfort in his body.

"Ha ha, remember, don't gaze upon God, but I just came from a world with an iron rule: do not look."

However, Ernest suddenly revealed a hint of disappointment, "Oh, what a pity, it's really too pitiful."

"The power obtained from the will of the world is ultimately filled with costs. After I contaminated it, you cannot stay in this memory. Go back and tell Annalyn that this is a world of unspeakable mystery and terror, where even a slight mistake will lead to a terrible death, waiting silently."

In an instant, Zhao Xu began to feel his consciousness being stripped away, clearly being rejected by this world.

He had already realized that facing the "Ernest" in front of him, even in a memory, the one with dominant power was the other party.

Zhao Xu immediately shouted loudly, "This is what Annalyn's mentor wants to convey to you - what kind of man are you?"
"...in the void, a voice of laughter echoed instead."

"Congratulations, Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have officially upgraded to level 10!"
