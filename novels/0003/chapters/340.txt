Chapter 341: Idol

"Is this a sacred emblem?" Zhao Xu asked a question he thought was a bit silly.

"This sacred emblem was given to you by the church, not by the goddess. It's just that you can show off the goddess's power through this emblem," Lark said with a cold tone.

Hearing these words, Zhao Xu almost slapped his thigh in surprise.

In the past, Lei An had lent him a notebook written by the goddess when he was trying to awaken some pastoral abilities in Zhao Xu earlier.

This notebook was like a treasured item for Zhao Xu.

Unfortunately, Zhao Xu had directly obtained the "domain" and pastoral abilities such as dispelling undead creatures, and had directly displayed divine arts.

So Lei An had always envied Zhao Xu's divine blessings, but Zhao Xu himself had never touched the goddess's true treasures.

The "legendary library" on the top floor of the floating city still had a few notebooks written by the goddess, but the library spirit, Mu Duo, had warned him.

Before reaching a certain level, flipping through those notebooks would only lead him to be more confused. Therefore, Zhao Xu had not borrowed any of them.

It was troublesome to not reach the level, and he was worried.

Now that he had encountered a similar situation again, Zhao Xu felt a bit awkward.

"That's it, since you don't even have a goddess's treasure, it's a bit of a hassle," Lark's voice had a hint of doubt.

"What do you mean by saying that from the beginning? Why do you need a goddess's treasure?" Zhao Xu asked calmly.

"Well, actually, I thought we had another breakthrough possibility - when you don't have the 'miracle art' as a divine channel," Lark said.

Laxus at this time relied on her vast knowledge and said, "The opponent has blocked the owner at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, and eventually, a price will have to be paid." "Have you thought about the concept of idol?" "Idol?"

Laxus had previously reached the "Land of the Sleeper" in the half-face of the dead god, where she touched the idol of the "God of Slaughter". Later, in the brief story of "The Path to God" three times, she made the same actions as Edmund, the God of Slaughter, and obtained three divine powers at the idol.

As a result, Laxus knew that an idol was not just an idol, but also a carrier of divine power.

"What do you mean by 'creating an idol'?" Laxus immediately asked the intention behind Laxus' words, "Can the goddess make her divine power descend directly to the idol?"

The magic goddess who once controlled the magical network can control the entire world's magical energy channel, but there are still powerful entities that can cast spells. Here, the magical network is not the entirety of magic, but it is absolutely the most effective way to absorb magical energy.

It is also thanks to the existence of the magical network that the magical civilization has been able to spread and promote more wizards.

Even the gods, when granting divine power, are assisted by the magical network.

It's like a water pipe that connects to every household. If there is no pipe, you have to carry a bucket to the river to fetch water, which is not as convenient as using a pipe.

And the gods also have to consider the efficiency problem when granting divine power. Otherwise, the gods would directly project their divine power to kill all enemies, and there would be no need to develop a loyal force.
The text describes a conversation between Lark and Zhao Xuan about the use of talismans and rituals to summon divine powers. Lark explains that the talisman itself is a low-consumption "divine power" channel, while the idol, being imbued with the mark of the divine, can also serve as a low-cost "divine power transmission" channel. However, Zhao Xuan points out that relying solely on talismas is insufficient and that a more complex ritual involving a more realistic depiction of the deity is needed to produce the desired effect. Lark then suggests that they use a more efficient method by using a spell to transform into a goddess and then adding a talisman as a medium to communicate with the divine will.

However, Zhao Xu still had doubts, "If that's the case, wouldn't it be possible to achieve this effect by using magic to transform into the goddess's appearance with a token from the goddess?"

Arthur pondered for a moment. If someone could easily achieve this, it would certainly be easily replicated by others. Therefore, the knowledge of magic, profession, and expertise would become a barrier that is difficult to imitate.

However, the use of a particular magic cannot become a unique skill. Something that is easily copied cannot form a barrier.

"No, ordinary mages or priests can only transform into the goddess's appearance through magic, but they are not like me," Lirix said with a serious tone.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood. His magic could transform into reality.

This was because he had seen Sylvana before. When he saw her, Sylvana had not yet become the third-generation goddess of magic.

This realization sent a chill down Zhao Xu's spine.

It meant that the scene he had seen was real and had existed in history.

He had changed his "past" in the present moment by sitting on the throne of the Oracle.

"Can you give me an answer?" Glazier urged, pressing Zhao Xu to give some vague possibilities.

"There must be a way," Lirix said, feeling a sense of impending doom, "If I were to die in front of Glazier, there might be a possibility of exposure."

"If that happens, the other party might pay a huge price, project more abilities, and directly use their skills to capture me. So, I'll have to take a gamble and become a divine artifact."

Zhao Xu felt the rhythm of Lirix's heartbeat at that moment.

The rhythm of this verse lets him know that Laxus is probably worried about his emotions.

Just now, she didn't persuade Zhao Xu to turn her into an artifact, and it's also because once Laxus enters the artifact form, it means everything will be eternal and unending.

Moreover, he is unable to completely eliminate the demon king of the abyss who is the original body, so this secret will inevitably leak out.

This means that Zhao Xu's eternal peace is impossible.

Even if he escapes, he will still be like this.

The temptation of the seven great gods cannot truly make the current gods abandon everything.

Because they are the gods themselves.

But the prophecy mentioned the eternal and unending point, which is enough to drive the gods crazy.

This means that the gods in the prophecy will become the eternal future, representing the order of the gods towards eternity.

The gods in the prophecy are the true eternal and unending ones.

The divine beings who have already occupied the seats of the seven great gods naturally welcome the seven great gods becoming the final determination.

As for the powerful existences that do not conform to the selection of the prophecy, they will either try to approach the origin of the prophecy or avoid making everything definite before they become facts.

It is possible that the powerful existences that just blocked the appearance of the seven gods will become the seven gods themselves and then push the seven gods to continue appearing.

Friends and enemies are always in a state of ambiguity.

"What do you say? It's just a matter of adding a little bit of divine power outside of the divine melody. As long as you can fill in the function of the token, the remaining goddess will automatically supplement," Laxus said with a furrowed brow.

As long as she intervenes herself, it's very easy to achieve these things.

However, she cannot show the slightest ability in front of Grazzite.
Here is the translation of the text:

This ancient, evil demon lord, who has witnessed the birth and demise of countless gods, has become a part of time itself. It is certain that it can recognize the origin of Lark's birth and background from the faintest clues.

At that time, his demands to Zhao Xuan would no longer be just a promise, let alone a simple one.

"Alright, I'll just eliminate you instead," Grazzt shook his head, his form already swelling to approach the black shadow behind him.

The originally small alchemical ascension platform was also gradually expanding to adapt to Grazzt's body shape.

"You can bet on it, a deep-sea lord like me can successfully capture the souls of players, rendering all your resurrection stones invalid," Grazzt revealed a cruel "smile" as he continued to threaten.

"You will definitely die and cannot become the corresponding fate. Humans, never underestimate the ability of a great evil king. It's not just magical powers and supernatural abilities that can understand human hearts."

Grazzt's demeanor had already become merciless, ready to strike Zhao Xuan at any moment.

"It seems that the master is really going to take action," Lark said solemnly.

However, Zhao Xuan's mind was clear and transparent, and his entire body slowly returned to the state of a devout priest at dawn prayer.

"Lark, can't you just get closer to God by a hair's breadth?" Zhao Xuan suddenly asked.

"What?" Lark looked puzzled.

"No," Zhao Xuan smiled, looking at Grazzt's projection in front of him, which had already inflated and burst through his robe, revealing a black, scaly, and thick-muscled demon body.

"Sisylva!"
