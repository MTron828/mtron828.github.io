Chapter 093: Half-Forged Prisoner

As he looked at the six former teammates repeating the same words, even though Luo Ya was gripping his weapons tightly, he couldn't help but shiver at the back of his neck.

A binding spell could control your loved ones to raise their knives against you.

Arthur's fame was not forged in a day.

If there were no divine patrols, then the spellcasters would dominate the world, and this saying of Arthur's would remain profound.

"Don't be afraid, it's all just illusions," Zhao Xu spoke calmly.

His eyes had already shifted from the six people in front of him to the dark depths behind them.

In this tunnel, the torches illuminated only a limited distance, but their light should be able to reach further away and provide a dim and bright visual effect.

However, the light was completely compressed within a circle of about 4.5 meters in diameter, as if wrapped in a huge black curtain.

"One 'Mage Armor' spell that provides intangible armor," the priestess spoke languidly, her face as mechanical as a wooden puppet.

"One 'Protection from Evil' spell that provides defensive bias, resistance to invasion, and resistance to invasion," the wandering rainbow-colored face stiffened, with her mouth open.

"One 'Holy Domain' spell that requires enemy attacks to be judged by intent," the warrior, Maple Leaf, seemed to have an invisible hand pressing his jawline, as if writing out the words.

"It's really not simple to have three such spells appear on the same person," the six people spoke in unison.

Luo Ya had already lost his patience and swung his sword violently, saying, "That's enough, let them stop, don't play with my teammates anymore."
Here is the translation:

That sword was about to strike with utmost fierceness, producing a sound that even Zhao Xu could hear, similar to the infinite fury burning in Luo Ya's heart.

"A cacophony." A cold and callous voice echoed from the dark and profound depths behind him.

There was no unusual change; it was just the magic power of a single voice. Luo Ya's entire body stiffened and he fell to the ground as if his vitality had been drained away.

Zhao Xu's entire body was paralyzed with fear.

As soon as the voice from behind him finished speaking, his information panel displayed a "Spell Identification Failure".

A direct, swift spell struck Luo Ya, faster than he could even react.

Zhao Xu slightly relaxed his grip on his defensive staff.

This was no longer a level-four spell â€“ a secondary spell could not have saved him.

"'Don't worry, it's just a 'Disabling' spell," a voice continued to echo from the dark depths.

Zhao Xu smiled wryly. "Disabling' is not a core spell; it's one that's hard to learn.

It can instantly kill anyone with less than 50 HP.

Anyone with -10 HP will truly die. To die in a state where their HP is exactly zero, only this spell can achieve that.

High-level mages can casually cast spells that overflow with damage that is hard to control. Instant-cast level-five spells, without any optimization, mean the opponent has a level-nine spellcasting position!

A 17-level mage who can cast level-nine spells sounds quite magical.

But even a 9-level mage who can only cast level-five spells is still beyond Zhao Xu's league.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't say he has a 'lesser spell barrier', even if he has a high-level version of the six-level arcane - one that can counteract first- to fourth-level spells' 'spell barrier' - it won't make a difference.

He can start casting fifth-level spells, and the mage's combat dimension has reached a new level, which is also when Anniya believes he has truly become strong.

"'Why not remove these illusions first?' Zhao Xu suggested.

Although Zhao Xu didn't use his trump card, the puppeteer behind the scenes seemed to be waiting.

"'As you wish,'"

The six illusionary figures standing stiffly suddenly dissipated like bubbles.

The flames on the ground expanded, and the darkness retreated further.

Zhao Xu finally saw that his original six teammates, from Youyou to Wuzhifeng, were all lying on the ground, their bodies twisted and tangled. It was unclear whether they had been affected by Luo Ya's gaze.

Zhao Xu estimated the surroundings and realized that the battlefield was too small, and the ripple effect might cause all present to create a divine temple.

However, Zhao Xu was not the type of person who would surrender when his teammates were captured. His only option was to fight to the death with the enemy after his teammates had sacrificed themselves.

Slowly, a mage dressed in a deep green robe and a hood appeared from the shadowy border.

He stood between the light and darkness, with an elegant demeanor, as if he were born into nobility. He held a metal scepter slightly shorter than Zhao Xu's staff in his hand.

A faint stench also spread through the air.

Zhao Xu focused on the scepter, recognizing its origin.

He had performed the awakening ritual before, and the old mage Mokar, who presided over the ceremony, had held a scepter similar to this one, 'Higher Super Magic: Instant Spell Scepter'."
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, Mokaer could directly cast spells of levels one to nine through the magical staff in his hand, three times a day, without needing to combine them with any advanced spell slots.

As for the mage standing before him, although he looked similar, it seemed that he didn't have the same level of prestige as Mokaer, and was probably only a normal version of the spell of levels one to six.

This meant that the mage's instant casting was due to the staff, not the level nine spell slot, which also reassured Zhao Xu'an somewhat.

"Why did you knock out my teammate?" Zhao Xu'an thought for a moment before asking.

At this point, the mage took another step forward from the shadows and looked up at Zhao Xu'an, saying, "It should be me asking you, why you dared to trespass on my territory of Leyen the Great Mage."

Seeing Leyen's true form, even Zhao Xu'an, who had seen many hell creatures in his previous life, couldn't help but take a step back.

The mage Leyen before him had a long snout, red glowing eyes, and half his face was already covered in black scaly skin. Moreover, two bat-like black wings were attached to his back, making him even more terrifying.

If Leyen had worn a mask, players might have thought he was a Batman-like character.

However, Zhao Xu'an, who had experienced the seal of the ancient war, knew that Leyen had already become a half-demon.

Mages had the ability to use illusions to change their appearance, especially Leyen, who had just used illusions to deceive them.

However, Leyen remained steadfast in his terrifying appearance, seemingly not caring about his half-demon identity.

After understanding this point, Zhao Xu'an's eyes also became more determined.

Half-demons were beings contaminated by evil forces, such as demons or other malevolent powers, and gained powerful abilities at the cost of falling into evil.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, you're saying I've already been very courteous by making you all half-dead, right?" The mage, Lain, sneered, his eyes gleaming with a madman's intensity.

"That's why you didn't take me down too?" Zhao Xu retorted.

He had already completed the preparation ritual - as long as he thought for a moment, the powerful force behind him would burst forth.
