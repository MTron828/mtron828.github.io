Chapter 450: Home Visit

"Zhao Xu, it's too busy at home during the New Year's holidays, and you're still going out?"

At this moment, Zhao's mother was preparing dinner for tonight, looking at Zhao Xu, who had just brushed his teeth and washed his face before preparing to leave.

Even on this rare holiday, she couldn't help but lament, "You're always glued to your phone and games at home, and now you're leaving again. It's not easy to see you."

"Mom, Dad is also going out today, so don't worry, I have a meeting with classmates tonight, and I'll be back soon," Zhao Xu replied.

But Zhao's mother shook her head, "He's going to the company today to give out year-end bonuses, can't he just stay?"

Just as she finished speaking, Zhao Xu had already quietly closed the self-owned door and pressed the elevator button to head to the first floor.

To be honest, Zhao Xu didn't really want to go out either.

It was just that this time, he happened to run into his high school friend who had returned from abroad. Yesterday, he had been playing games non-stop and his friend had called him non-stop for four or five hours.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu finished taking a bath that he realized what had happened.

About half an hour later, after getting off the subway and transferring, Zhao Xu arrived at a tea house that specialized in serving tea.

With the arrival of the New Year, many shops on the street had already closed, posting notices with the return date for next year. However, Zhao Xu didn't have the same experience of taking the train and feeling the "ahh" of childhood memories.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the Spring Festival approached, the tide of returning home had already passed, and shops along the street were open for business, with most entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on the peak season. Zhao Xu had agreed to meet some friends at a teahouse, which was still open for early tea due to the upcoming New Year's dinner.

"Hey, Xu-ge!"

Suddenly, a loud shout echoed through the entire hall, causing other diners enjoying their early tea to glance over before returning to their meals. The city was often characterized by its casual and detached attitude.

Zhao Xu quickly located his old high school friends who had suddenly shouted his name and walked over to them. "Xu-ge, it's been a long time!"

Liu Feng, his former classmate, directly approached him and patted him on the shoulder. "Yeah, it's been a long time."

Liu Feng couldn't help but chuckle and took a seat, handing Zhao Xu a menu. "Come on, let's order some dishes and catch up."

Zhao Xu didn't need to explain. In Liu Feng's eyes, they had seen each other during the winter holiday the previous year.

However, in Zhao Xu's memory, their last meeting was five years ago at a tavern. At that time, Liu Feng was full of confidence and ambition, and his exceptional abilities allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks. Two years later, he married a local noblewoman and became a prominent figure in the city, even organizing a renowned adventurer team.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu had experienced a series of setbacks and losses, including the destruction of his family and the devastating "Seal the Magic" war in the North.
When Zhao Xu, with a face full of wrinkles, met Liu Feng, who was full of vigor and vitality, again, the two high school friends who were almost the same age, looked like they had a difference of at least ten years.

Zhao Xu glanced at the menu, which had been marked with "honey-glazed phoenix claws," "steamed pork ribs," "char siu buns," and other snacks, and then selected "char siu noodles" and handed it to the waiter beside him, saying, "That's it, thank you."

At this time, the transparent glass bowl in front of him was turned on, and Zhao Xu directly took out the utensils from the package and put them in the bowl one by one to be reheated.

Liu Feng, who was sitting next to him, was a high school classmate who had gone abroad to study abroad after graduating from high school, while the other two friends, Hong Jiewei and Hou Tiansheng, had followed the same path as Zhao Xu, entering the university.

Hong Jiewei, who was also a classmate of Zhao Xu, had the same hometown as Zhao Xu, so he had a close relationship with him due to geographical reasons. Although Atlantis was the last port of call after the earth was destroyed, it is undeniable that most people were bound to their hometowns after losing convenient transportation tools and rarely left.

As for Zhao Xu and his friends, they were adventurers who could explore the world, visit different places, and get to know the local customs and people. They could even have the opportunity to meet the locals and have a good time with them.

"Lao Xu, I'm really sorry, I'm late this time. Let's have a cup of tea instead of wine, and let's toast to you all," Liu Feng said, looking around at everyone.

After everyone clinked their cups together, Liu Feng didn't seem to be nervous at all, and he started chatting casually, without focusing on his own study abroad experience. Instead, he started talking about some online entertainment, which quickly created a cozy atmosphere at the table.

Zhao Xu looked at Liu Feng with a sentimental expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

Regardless of whether it's on Earth or in Arthur, those who are good at making friends are often people like Liu Feng, who can get along with anyone. Even he and Hong Qiwei, the "homebody" type, wouldn't bother to attend such a reunion without Liu Feng's coordination.

"Xu Ge, have you played 'Arthur'?" Suddenly, friend Hou Tianxiong asked, and he and Hong Qiwei are both game enthusiasts who introduced Zhao Xu to some games in junior high school.

However, after entering university, Zhao Xu began to play less and less, gradually withdrawing from the game.

"Just played a bit, still not very skilled," Xu Ge replied with a slightly shy smile, compared to people like Anzhenia, he was indeed not very good.

Xu Ge didn't intend to pretend or lead the conversation in this direction.

At this moment, he seemed like an outsider, not the top player in Arthur as usual.

"That's great, then," Hou Tianxiong said. "I think this game will definitely be a hit in the second half of the year and become the number one game. I've re-registered three accounts and have mastered the basic mechanisms. Now, I can earn money by playing and don't need to spend my family's money to go out with my girlfriend every month."

Xu Ge listened silently and smiled to himself.

Many people in the past have used the popularity of the game Arthur to exchange game coins for RMB, and have felt extremely proud of themselves.

However, after a few months, they realized that the game's initial advantage had been lost, and they were stuck with nothing.

"Clearly, you betrayed our FFF team and got rich, didn't you?" Hong Qiwei said, his belly full, as he took a steamed bun and tea set that had been prepared and said, "I've made a fortune in the game and have invested in weapons and equipment. It's really great."

"I don't know how you gamers can complain about being exhausted every day,"
Here is the translation of the text:

Hou Tian was taken aback and exclaimed, "What a joy of adulthood! How can you, a fatso, understand this? Arthur's game has blocked all 18+ content, but in reality, you can still vent your frustrations by beating up Little Yellow Oil in the game, while in the game, you can ascend to heaven!"

Hou Tian immediately defended the three-dimensional space as heretical, and Hong Qiwei again began to argue.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu silently poured tea for everyone, and in fact, he was the most outstanding math whiz among the group, including Hong Qiwei.

He had married a wife in his past life, and Zhao Xu had also seen her, a true paragon of elegance.

It can only be said that this crossover has brought a life-changing experience to many homebodies who are addicted to games. Like Zhao Xu, who was struggling to get by, but still hadn't given up.

"Liu Feng said that Arthur's game feels pretty good, but it's not open in China yet. I'm afraid it will be a bit laggy if I play the Chinese version now," Liu Feng lamented.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's expression changed.

If what Anzhiya said was true, the game would be open in about six or seven months.

Assuming that the Chinese version would also be shortened to about 8 months, it would be quite a significant change.

However, for foreign players, it would be directly reduced from 6 months to 2 months, which would be a significant change for some professionals, who might not even have enough time to complete their training.

Moreover, the 9-week period of the previous life had already passed.

In his past life, Liu Feng was introduced to Arthur's game by Hou Tian over a cup of tea.

Now, he has missed the crucial 4-month gaming period and is wondering whether he can still seize the opportunity to marry a beauty and rise to fame like in his past life.
Here is the translation:

"Macaque, sharpening one's knife does not miss the chance to chop firewood. Do you think this game has great potential and could have a good several-year lifecycle? If so, shouldn't we invest in strengthening ourselves now? With a stronger strength, you can join the top team and earn more money."

Zhou Xu whispered to Hou Tiansheng.

At this moment, the other party looked puzzled, because in his eyes, Zhou Xu had never shown much interest in games, even when he played, it was just to accompany them together, equivalent to finding a common hobby.

"Oh, then I'll pay attention to it later," Hou Tiansheng said, not knowing why, feeling that this time he saw Zhou Xu, who was both unfamiliar and familiar, and the words he spoke seemed to have an added persuasive power.

"As for Liu Feng, oh, forget it, I'll give you my proxy, you can use that accelerator to play the foreign server," Zhou Xu said.

"Eh, eh, Xu Shao, aren't you not interested in playing games?" Liu Feng couldn't help but be astonished by the expression on his face, almost thinking that the Zhou Xu in front of him was an imposter.

"Because I saw some different things in this game," Zhou Xu said confidently, his expression self-assured.

Liu Feng's expression also became solemn, and he nodded slightly.

"Fat guy, look, Xu Shao is so serious, it seems like he's been pulled into this game. Looks like Arthur is really powerful," Hou Tiansheng said with a hint of ambiguity, "Xu Shao, you won't be obsessed with the characters in the game, will you?"

As he spoke, he pointed to the poster outside the mobile communication building.

At this moment, a giant poster on the outside of the building depicted a woman with silver armor and golden hair, looking fierce and determined, brandishing a sword towards the front.

"Like this Silver Armor Rider?" Hou Tiansheng asked.

Suddenly, Hong Qiwu, with a mouthful of glutinous rice balls, directly contradicted, "Get lost, Viola is our player, not yours to desecrate her."

"Viola?" Zhou Xu was taken aback, wondering how others knew about her.

How did others recognize her?
Here is the translation:

"She isn't from May 5th, is she?"

"You don't know? It's obvious that she's someone who doesn't often visit the gossip forum. Ever since these game posters went up, Vivian's popularity has skyrocketed to the top."

"According to the official statement, these characters are all real NPCs in the game, so the forum is all guessing where Vivian is from, and the speculation is going wild."

"But how do you know her name is Vivian?" Zhao Xu was taken aback.

At this point, his gaze also followed the window, as if looking at Vivian's eyes on the poster.

"Xu, the game's official information has been released," Hong Qiwei said. "Are you saying Xu, that you know our goddess?"

"Yes, she's under my care."

"Haha, Xu, this joke, I give you a full score."

But Hou Tianxiong couldn't help but burst out laughing, without any mocking tone.

For these old friends, this was just a joke.

" Ding-dong."

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's phone rang, displaying his mother's home phone number.

He didn't even say a word and directly picked it up.

"Zhao Xu, where are you getting into trouble and flirting with girls, a beautiful girl has come to look for you at home."

"Who?" Zhao Xu thought to himself, wondering how he had time to get into trouble, since he was a student.

"She introduced herself, her name is An Tiya, is she a friend you've made online? You guys use network IDs to chat in real life?"

At this moment, Zhao Xu's face turned pale.

"Mom, please take care of her, I'll be right back."

(Note: I've translated the text accurately, but please note that the story seems to be a part of a larger narrative, and some context may be missing. Also, I've kept the names and terms as they appear in the original text.)
"Oh, Zhao Xu, you can't possibly think that you're going to make a big deal out of this, right? I'm telling you, if you're still young and can do something like this, I...I...I..."
