Chapter 603: The Shocking Transformation in the Cave, Source of Suppression

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu's mind whirled around as he continued to add more "buff" spells to himself, piling up his static defense to its peak.

In an instant, a streak of "magical radiance" burst forth on his body, shining brightly in the pitch-black cave.

As for attributes, he had cast four to five spells on himself.

The three-ring demon domain spell "Pride of the Demon" (spell duration), increased his charisma by 4 points, making him a "non-human" and immune to effects targeting human-like beings.

The four-ring poet spell "Beautiful Soul" (spell delay), directly mapped the external physical appearance of the caster, revealing the true beauty or ugliness of the caster.

This spell, which could make evil creatures ugly, also made Zhao Xu more handsome, increasing his agility and charisma by 4 points.

The four-ring spell "Cerberus's Blessing" (spell duration), directly increased Zhao Xu's agility and charisma by 4 points, and his defense level was equivalent to the adjustment of his charisma, with a total of 10 levels.

The three-ring holy warrior spell "Righteous Anger" (spell duration), directly increased Zhao Xu's strength by 4 points.

At this point, Zhao Xu's attributes reached: strength 53 (+21), agility 26 (+8), vitality 17 (+3), intelligence 29 (+9), perception 19 (+4), and charm 30 (+10).
Here is the translation:

He is as charming as a sorcerer, radiating an astonishing charm and infectious power, regardless of who he interacts with. Meanwhile, his defensive capabilities have skyrocketed to 53 levels, thanks to the effects of new skills such as the Big Sage's Robe, Dragon Skin, Warrior's Waistband, Shielding, and Praise. Even if he encounters a legendary warrior, he can educate them on what it means to be "impertinent as a young person."

After completing these tasks, Zhao Xu still exercised caution and directly looked at his 9th-level character's "Dragon Seer" skill, which he had simulated with his latent potential points. He then activated the skill's ability, "Sacrificial Praise Ritual."

„ÄêAdventurer Zhong Xia, you are in a Sacrificial Praise state (9 turns), with a bonus to your saving throws and insight. You gain 1 temporary latent potential point due to your "Prophecy Hero" skill. In addition to the 1 latent potential point provided by "Unbridled Heroism" each turn, you also have an additional 1 point of temporary latent potential that you can freely allocate. If necessary, you can consume 2 latent potential points in one turn, amplifying its effect.]

Zhao Xu said, "Dream, ready? I'm about to speed up!" Meanwhile, the incantation for "Quick Burst" flashed through his mind, and the entire spell's structure was crystal clear in his brain.

At this time, countless players were still struggling to absorb the knowledge of previously neglected spells. Now that he had crossed over, other professions could learn from him, but only wizards could truly master all the spell knowledge before they could make any progress.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah." The intelligent will of the cloak, "Dream" spoke briefly and concisely.

Zhao Xu immediately leapt towards the ground, disappearing instantly before the crowd.

"Hey, he's going to kill himself?" a guard suddenly shouted.

"Don't be silly, the mage has a flying technique," someone said.

"That's right, it's probably a flying technique," a reserved guard patted his shoulder, saying, "Take it easy, Arthur's abilities are beyond my imagination."

"Good luck, and remind your brother to sign up for the mage class when the resources are good," someone said.

"I also want to, but who knows when he'll come out, and I'm just a 1st-level mercenary, it's impossible for me to support a mage apprentice for more than ten years," someone else said.

At this time, the guards who were dealing with the situation looked in the direction where Zhao Xu was heading, half-hoping and half-regretting their earlier decision.

Zhao Xu, who was holding onto "Swift Burst" and preparing to unleash it at any moment to gain "bullet time", relied on his flying ability and descended slowly and vertically, as if suspended by a rope.

However, in this completely dark environment, he couldn't see even a hint of "light".

The nearby walls, which were wet and slippery, were unable to provide any grip, and no one knew how those "undying creatures" managed to crawl out from here.

As he simulated the speed of "Spectral Vision" descent, he silently counted the time in his mind, his thoughts racing with calculations.

If he hadn't become a powerful mage by now, he would have been terrified by this eerie and quiet environment, especially the "opening above", which represented hope and light, was becoming increasingly small.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, at the 15th second mark, Zhao Xu's eyes widened in surprise. He quickly grabbed the wall with one hand, but it was too late to exert any force. As he lost the flying ability brought by magic, his entire body began to plummet towards the ground.

In this moment, the advantage of those species born with wings became apparent. For those without wings, it meant a fate of certain death.

At this moment, all of Zhao Xu's 30+ skills had lost their effectiveness, turning him into a blank slate at level 10. Only his prayer skills and attribute enhancements from reading the manual remained. Fortunately, his physical quality was still top-notch, and his inner heart did not show too much fear.

Unfortunately, his climbing skills had also instantaneously reset to zero. Otherwise, even on a super smooth cliff face, he could have created a miracle with his piling skills.

In a flash, Zhao Xu scanned the information on his character panel, but most of his abilities had become dull and unusable. Even his supernatural abilities were suppressed by the anti-magic field.

The only exception was the temporary "latent point" he obtained from "Dragon Prophet" and "Prophecy Hero", which remained intact. This was also his only chance to reverse reality.

Observing himself, Zhao Xu remained calm and composed, showing no sign of panic.
Here is the translation:

At that instant, he pulled out a unique scroll of the "Call of Power" technique, which was unparalleled in the world. The wealthy Zhao Xu, although he had mastered the techniques from "six rings" to "nine rings", was unable to use them at will before mastering them. However, he had prepared in advance by investing a lot of effort and resources, and was ready to respond to emergencies. The "Call of Power" technique, with its unique ability to suppress magic in the anti-magic zone, was the only technique that could trigger a brief flash of magical energy within the area. This was also the most important function, as it would allow him to cast a spell no higher than four rings later. A one-way portal was sufficient for him to return to the cave. As he observed the falling speed and time, he had calculated the absolute distance and was preparing to escape before the limit. At that moment, he decided not to wait for the East China Empire's Starry Sky Academy to open, and instead chose to advance to the 10th level of the divine technique, either "Warrior's Edge" or "Crossbow Legion", and learn the "Iron Heart Power" as soon as possible. At that time, he would no longer have to worry about the "negative state" that could kill him with a single blow. However, just at that moment, all the "suppression forces" on his body suddenly disappeared. He then fell onto the surface of a smooth and clean lake. Zhao Xu's entire body regained its freedom in mid-air, and the magical power was restored to his body. He gazed at the waves of the lake, which were constantly rising and falling - this was a portal.
