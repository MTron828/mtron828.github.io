Chapter 399: The Black Market

Zhao Xu directly pulled out a letter with a red seal from his chest, revealing the magic mark on top. "The Matriarchal Council of the Magic Order, dispatched," he said, displaying his own magic badge. "Hand it over and take a look," the leader of the guard said, his expression grave.

As the person in charge of guarding the city gate, he had received training in document recognition and was familiar with the official seals of public documents. However, this one related to magical powers and he was cautious. He even considered calling in the powerful mage who was resting in the adjacent room to verify the authenticity of the letter.

Zhao Xu's letter was genuine and he handed it over without hesitation. The guard looked at it several times before still not daring to open the red seal to inspect it. He handed it back and allowed the two to enter the city.

The two men were dressed in traditional mage attire, wrapped up tightly as if their skin would be burned by the air. Unless it was at dawn when they received an order to inspect rigorously, he would not dare to ask them many questions and would let them pass directly. He would not dare to offend the high-ranking mages, as the city guards would not take the initiative to protect someone like him.

This was also the experience of the guards of the vast Northern Alliance.

"Is it because we're wearing mage robes that we're not questioned at all?" he wondered. If it was a chaotic abyss, it would be no surprise to encounter such a situation, as there was no order to speak of. However, it was unexpected that just because they were both dressed in mage robes and handed over a letter with a seal, they could easily bypass the guards.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "mastermind" behind the eerie atmosphere in the entire town was standing right in front of the guard. "That's natural," said Zhao Xu. "We were holding back our close-range abilities at the time, and they might have thought we were another powerful warrior or even a team of exceptional fighters. There's even a possibility that some kind of mysterious creature was involved."

"Naturally, no one would suspect us two mages," Zhao Xu explained.

Last night's battle was a close call, with Zhao Xu and Wei Wei both exhausted. The cavalrymen they encountered were not ordinary bandits, but rather regular soldiers from the Northern Alliance.

Zhao Xu immediately recognized that the enemy was from the Northern Alliance, and he thought he saw some similarities in their training. This meant that he had underestimated them, and he thought it would be better to keep it under wraps. After all, he was going to take up a position at the Northern Alliance's Mage Association.

Moreover, the enemy had already seen their ability to fly without wings, which made them think that Zhao Xu was a Three-Ring Mage. This made it clear that they would not hesitate to kill them. In addition, the two exceptional young men who emerged had used several powerful magical items.

Zhao Xu didn't want to cause trouble, so he took the three treasure boxes left by the enemy. However, he didn't take the remaining magical items used by the enemy.
Here is the translation of the text:

Sometimes, when taking away magical items from renowned adventurers, if not handled in time, they may be traced back later.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but look back at the distant blue sky.

"What's unusual?" This time, Vivi was also wearing a long robe and had deliberately wrapped a cloak around her face to conceal her extraordinary beauty.

With a 30-point charm value and a face that conforms to human aesthetics, she was completely irresistible in all directions.

"It's nothing." Zhao Xu smiled.

In the impression, there was only one major event in the town of Zhenyuan over the next few years.

It's unlikely to be related to the "Holy Breath" that devastated the entire twilight forest five years later, right?

Zhao Xu's head began to ache at this thought. At the time, there were no other people nearby, and he didn't understand the falling object that had destroyed the entire forest and several small towns.

It was only heard that countless adventurers had rushed to the mysterious fortress that had fallen from the sky.

"Vivi, don't you want to?" Zhao Xu asked.

Vivi shook her head immediately. "I have my own limitations on using magical items. I can only use those special equipment."

The first of the five copper boxes opened by Zhao Xu was the "Power Rune Wand".

The second box opened by him was the "Wu Xue Waist Belt".

As for the remaining three boxes, the complex magical symbols involved were beyond Zhao Xu's three-ring "Dispel Magic" ability. He could only rely on his 28-point intelligence and powerful mental calculation ability to break the secret code.

However, Zhao Xu had estimated the calculation scale and did not expect to open the box and take out the contents in a few days.
Here is the translation:

The second treasure chest contains the "Buddhist Monk's Waist Belt" which looks extremely ordinary, just a rough rope. It's tied around Zhao Xu's innerwear, with no special feeling, completely lacking the flashy effect of a magical item. Moreover, the market price of this magical item is around 13,000 gold coins, not a rare treasure. Wearing the Buddhist Monk's Waist Belt can enhance the abilities of a Buddhist Monk. Those who are not yet at the level of a Buddhist Monk can, for example, enhance their defensive awareness and physical damage resistance to the level of a 5th-level Buddhist Monk. Buddhist Monks are known for their exceptional hand-to-hand combat skills, possessing a unique sixth sense to dodge attacks. This sense can manifest as a defensive ability that can be stacked like agility. Right now, he is walking down the street, and his mind seems to be able to intuit the rhythm of the people's movements. Zhao Xu's defensive ability has been boosted by 2 levels (perception) to level 20. The breakdown is: 10 levels (basic), 6 levels (higher-level wizard's armor), 1 level (agility), 2 levels (luck, magical staff), 2 levels (perception, Buddhist Monk's Waist Belt), and -1 (flaw). If he adds the shield spell, he can boost it to level 24. However, after seeing Viola's "+2 Floating Mirror Reflection" great steel shield, Zhao Xu realized that he had overlooked something. The armor has a failure rate for magical effects, so he cannot wear it. However, the shield is still acceptable because it can combine with magical effects, especially when paired with the "+2 value" "Floating" effect, allowing him to release his hands and not affect the spellcasting action, leaving room for combining with other magical effects.
Here is the translation of the text:

An adventurer equipped two round shields, which, although cumbersome, allowed him to have an additional shield that could be enchanted, naturally resulting in extra enchantment effects.

Viola could reverse the effects of a daily spell "Mirage" enchantment, as long as she had the means, and no one would lose out.

Even if he wasn't careful, he could reflect the "Death's Finger" and counterattack his enemies.

"Shall we continue to head to Winter City directly?" Viola asked.

"No, let's go to the Black Market," Zhao Xu smiled.

"The Black Market?" Zhao Xu was not wealthy in his past life, and the famous Black Market in the town, which was said to have countless magical items for underground trading, was not a place he had ever been to.

This time, he naturally wanted to go shopping.

Assisted by the temple, he had captured the demons and helped Wang Qingwei and Eisvich escape from the half-plane, and he had indeed received a fortune in gold coins.

In addition, Anzino saw him off on his journey and gave him a "Final Scroll" allowance for a member's living expenses, as well as a "Consolation Gold" due to his poverty.

Now, Zhao Xu could buy one or two magical items without worrying about it.

"Let's go take a look at the Black Market and see if there are any magical items suitable for you," Zhao Xu said.

"Last night's battle?" Viola asked with a hint of guilt.

"No problem, I also need to replenish my magical equipment," Zhao Xu replied.

Zhao Xu sighed, realizing that Viola, as a demon, was not like other demons born with combat abilities.

Her attack methods were limited, and the magical abilities she mastered were mostly supportive, with some limited uses for "Hint" and "Higher Teleportation".

Her rare supernatural ability to absorb the level of "Energy Absorption" from others could be achieved through "Kiss" or "Force Hug".
Here is the translation:

As the current Vivian, she would not be able to perform such actions as a noble paladin. This ability has also become half-broken. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu's magical position is also a big problem. After the intensity increased, his magical position, which was the most abundant among players, couldn't keep up. So, he was forced to convert his magical ability into melee combat ability when he went to war against that nest yesterday. This time, he also wants to see if he can find the "Wizard's Curse" on the black market. This magical item can make a wizard's magical position double, which is exactly what Zhao Xu needs after he sold the invisible ring he obtained the ownership of the wizard's tower and now has an empty hand.

"Wait until I bring you to the black market, and we will maintain a spiritual connection throughout the process to avoid speaking," Zhao Xu instructed.

"Okay," Vivian replied immediately, entering a state of synchronization.

"This dirty place has many rules," Zhao Xu sneered, "I'll explain it to you slowly later."

In his previous life, Zhao Xu learned the rules of the black market in the Northern Alliance, but he never used them and instead found it to be a black humor.

As he thought about this, he couldn't help but feel a headache.

From his parents to Zheng Xin, Wang Qingwei, Asvi, Zhang Qi, and others, as soon as he encountered a suitable magical item, he would have to be mindful of giving it to someone else. Unfortunately, he still has the capital gain from the secret silver mine in the Star Lake, but he has not yet officially received it from the church in the Winter City. Originally, as one of the top few wealthy players, Zhao Xu suddenly felt the cruelty of life.
