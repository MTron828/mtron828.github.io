Chapter 212: The War Begins

Zhao Xu gazed at the group of undead beings, his heart skipping a beat. In reality, he didn't want to get close to them, lest he be infected by the "despair" terror spirit.

Zhao Xu's mind was constantly scheming up various plans.

After a while, he finally made up his mind and went alone to the hanging rope on the opposite side of the high platform, as if he had already obtained the key.

Throughout the process, Zhao Xu kept an eye on the situation around him, noticing that there were more than one undead being.

The only thing that gave him solace was that he hadn't discovered any higher-level undead beings.

This also meant that, in the event of a problem, he, who possessed the fireball technique, could still escape unscathed.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu reached the base of the high platform that he discovered a rope hanging down from above. He lightly grasped it and, according to his previous habit, tried to confirm its safety by exerting some force.

However, Zhao Xu suddenly felt that he had lost his footing and almost fell backwards.

But what was even more ridiculous was that the entire rope suddenly dropped to the ground, clearly not being tightly secured from the start. It was as if it was just randomly tied up.

Otherwise, if it had broken or been overloaded, there would definitely be obvious signs.

Zhao Xu could only sigh and say that this setup was clearly designed to trap people who had obtained the key and were rushing to get up here. If there was no rope, people would have thought of other methods.

But it was precisely because he had left a rope at the location where life was present, making it clear that he wanted to confuse people, so that everyone would start off unprepared.

At this point, Zhao Xu also made up his mind, no matter what he saw, he would firmly believe in himself.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Zhao Xu at this time couldn't care less about much, and he directly approached a just-passed-by undead skeletal warrior.

As these mindless creatures wouldn't suspect anything even if Zhao Xu wore a priest's ceremonial robe, he took out a piece of fresh meat and bone fragments from his backpack and mixed them together.

The originally ferocious-looking skeletal warrior suddenly shook its skull, and the originally fiery head began to change its color to blue, indicating that it had been controlled by him.

This is a rather cruel second-ring spell that allows Zhao Xu to obtain an undead servant from now on.

Zhao Xu, the fake undead, would definitely cause trouble, and it's uncertain whether it's the mummy group that would attack him.

But if it's a real undead, there's no need to worry about it.

The skeletal warrior controlled by Zhao Xu slowly approached the mummy group.

The spell's effectiveness lasts for one day for each caster level, and if the target is an undead like a skeletal warrior, there's no need to make a saving throw.

Since the skeletal warrior itself has no spell resistance, Zhao Xu basically used one spell for each skeletal warrior.

However, for higher-level undead, whether it's intelligence or influence, it's much more complex.

Finally, Zhao Xu noticed that the skeletal warrior had walked into the position he wanted and began to search around, clearing away the pile of bones.

After clearing the area for a while, the skeletal warrior finally found a long key. However, in an instant, the skeletal warrior suddenly broke apart and turned into fragments of bones, falling to the ground.
Here is the translation:

Zhou Xu's eyes widened as he saw the scene before him, and he strenuously pondered the reason why the mummy was destroyed. It was not that the mummies were attacking the mummy, nor was there any mysterious shadow, but the mummy was simply dead in such a mysterious way.

At this moment, Zhou Xu looked up at the high platform above, preparing to go up. He followed the normal procedure, directly activating the transmission boot effect on his foot, and the transmission power enveloped his entire body in an instant.

Zhou Xu didn't hurry, and he didn't wait for the last moment; he directly followed the steps of "Secondary Quick Release".

In an instant, Zhou Xu had transmitted himself to the high platform.

At this moment, Zhou Xu had already pulled out a "jewel" from his pocket and gently opened it, re-tying it to the stone tablet.

He had made it so that it wouldn't be pulled down to the ground.

At the same time, Zhou Xu took out a "jewel" and threw it into the corner, which was created by him after summoning the "Millennium Book of Magic" during his battle with the "Deep Furnace Magician". This jewel was imbued with a permanent "Jewel Jump" spell.

As long as Zhou Xu concentrated his mind and input the incantation, he could teleport to another location.

It was just like the "Flying Lightning God" technique of a golden-haired ninja.

If any unexpected events occurred, and Zhou Xu couldn't return smoothly, he would activate the "Jewel Jump" spell by crushing the jewel on the square.

Finally, Zhou Xu climbed down the rope and walked towards the group of mummies. He stood 10 meters away and cast the "Invisible Servant" spell.

Undead creatures couldn't take the glowing key, probably because the key itself was somehow strange.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, when the invisible servant appeared, Zhao Xu summoned another invisible servant. Zhao Xu had already thought of a plan and sent one of the invisible servants to go ahead. Throughout the process, his attention was gradually focused, and he finally saw the invisible servant successfully pick up the teleportation key.

Zhao Xu only relaxed his breath before he immediately began to cast the second spell he had learned, "Teleportation." This spell could switch the positions of two target biological entities instantly.

Just as he was about to take the teleportation key from the invisible servant in front of him.

Suddenly, the invisible servant in front of him vanished into thin air, killed on the spot. Then, Zhao Xu saw a creature appear behind the invisible servant - a Fear Spirit!

Zhao Xu had no idea how many unknown enemies would appear next. At that moment, he could feel the Fear Spirit's fear aura spreading towards him, a chilling feeling.

Zhao Xu directly reached into his pouch and grasped the gemstone. Since the distance to the target platform was at least 100 meters away, and the teleportation boots were only for short-distance travel, Zhao Xu decided to use the gemstone to jump back.

[Adventurer, this region is locked by the "Dimensional Lock" effect and cannot be teleported!]

Zhao Xu suddenly saw this message, but he didn't stay surprised for long, as more undead creatures began to emerge in front of him.

He had already realized that he couldn't hide from these undead creatures anymore. Maybe some unknown eyes had been watching him since the moment he jumped down. Ultimately, he discovered a secret at this moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu also directly took out the "Fireball Mastery Eternal Wand" from his pocket.
He faced the mighty wind on the square, indifferently surveying the undead creatures in front of him.
Ultimately, it's only by fighting that one can know.
