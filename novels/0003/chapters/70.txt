Chapter 7: Mutual Accommodation

Zhao Xu looked at the four players sitting at the bar in the tavern, and they were all staring back at him.

A warrior wearing leather armor and wielding a large sword, a rogue holding a dagger, a bard sitting in the corner, and a female novice priestess - what an interesting group.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity when he looked at the warrior's gear.

The warrior's profession was really too poor, with initial weapons and armor all being cheap. They couldn't even afford to buy heavier armor, so they had to settle for low-defense leather armor.

The Caesar's aide reminded them of the meeting time and location for the next day and then left.

Zhao Xu sat down directly and introduced himself. "My name is Zhou Xia, a mage, and my destination is Mistral."

"The Maple Leaf, a 1st-level warrior, same destination," the warrior replied with a rough voice.

"Clover, 1st-level rogue, same destination," the rogue added, still a young man who probably hadn't even graduated from college yet.

"South Polar Toad, 1st-level bard," the bard estimated to be around the same age as Zhao Xu, probably still in school skipping class to play games.

"Yu Yu, novice priestess," the priestess looked at Zhao Xu's figure and couldn't help but shrink back a bit.

When he heard the last word, "novice priestess," Zhao Xu also couldn't help but furrow his brow, and he was actually right.

"The novice priestess hasn't completed her training, so there's no need to get involved in this mess," he said directly.

As players, they didn't need to be polite, and Zhao Xu got straight to the point.

This wasn't a school trip, and Zhao Xu had to cross the entire mountain range, and Anzhenya had given him three assassination tasks, but he hadn't planned to save any of them.
Here is the translation of the text:

"No, it's because we have to go to Mistral that's the reason," said Warrior Maple Leaf, who was the leader of the group.

Although it was still daytime, a group of adventurers had just returned, filling the tavern with a lively atmosphere that drowned out their voices.

"Tell me," said Zhao Xu, who had been around for a while, "you have to make sure to remove every single trap before going on an adventure. Who knows what kind of unexpected dangers we'll face on the road."

"Ah, Mr. Spellcaster, you're just with us, and if you don't want to cooperate, you can hide behind us when we encounter danger. As long as we three don't fall, you'll be absolutely safe," said the traveling poet, Nan Qi, who was standing nearby.

Zhao Xu chuckled to himself, thinking that this team was not a proper one, but rather a group of friends getting together.

However, this group was not the type to follow orders, so Zhao Xu didn't need to worry about all four of them attacking him at the same time. As long as they didn't attack together, he was confident that he could take them down one by one.

"Ah, I'm just curious," said Zhao Xu. "Even if we make it smoothly, it'll take at least half a month. What about the novice priestess, Miss Habitant?"

Zhao Xu's gaze fell directly on Priestess Youyu, who was wearing a priestly robe.

The other priestess didn't have the basic holy symbol on her chest.

In the early days of the Church of the Gods, playing with the behavior of priests was a serious offense, and even Zhao Xu, who was not afraid of anything, wouldn't dare to do such a thing.

"Actually, I've changed my faith," said Priestess Youyu, finally speaking up, her voice trembling with weakness.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at the missionary miss, who was indeed very elegant and refined, looking just like a girl from next door. If this young woman knew that the missionary, Arthur, had received divine power, she would probably not easily put on that sacrificial robe.

"What, did you change your faith?" Zhao Xu thought back to this term.

"Didn't you receive half of your training before changing your faith?" Zhao Xu began to feel a bad premonition.

"It was only after she received divine power that she changed her faith," Rainbow, the wanderer, explained.

Zhao Xu, who was accustomed to two lives, only wanted to say one word at this moment.

Is the Temple of the Gods really a restaurant, where you order food and eat until you're full and then leave?

It's no wonder that this woman, called Youyou, couldn't convert to the Church of Heaven in the Tianbei commercial alliance area.

The robe with those stripes on Youyou's body was something Zhao Xu didn't need to examine to know was the symbol of the goddess of commerce and wealth.

It's clear that Youyou is going to convert to the temple of the goddess of magic.

The goddess of commerce and wealth and the goddess of magic are part of the same faction. It's more troublesome to switch between them.

As for the priests who have received divine power, if they want to return to their original faith, it's also allowed, as long as the faction's power can provide divine power. They basically won't lose anything.

This is also the path Zhao Xu left for himself.

If you switch to an opposing faction, the other side will also settle this matter for you, and they will definitely give you enough compensation.

But if you switch to the same faction, you'll have to undergo a faith test.

This young missionary is still a novice and hasn't become a level one priest. She's only received divine power.

So the faith test is just like climbing a mountain, one step at a time, to get to Mystera.

If he really became a 1st-level cleric and changed his occupation, the cleric lady wouldn't be able to say no to fighting a few demons. It's no wonder that the other three players looked pale, having just managed to grab a leg treatment and branching out. "Mr. Zhongxia, what about you? You said you're a mage? Which mage are you?" asked the warrior Qianyue.

"I? My profession is called mage," said Zhao Xu, who couldn't bring himself to say he was a dual elite.

He couldn't pretend to be a 1st-level cleric and 1st-level mage, or the forum would be blown up tomorrow.

The team in front of him didn't have a cleric, and once they went to war, he would have to expose his identity by casting healing spells.

Zhao Xu thought to himself that it was okay, after all, a girl could grow up to be a goddess cleric.

He just hoped that the clergy would see him as a pastor's assistant and give him some compensation.

"Mr. Mage, you're lying," suddenly said a novice cleric who was hiding in the corner.

"Yes?" Zhao Xu didn't expect his lie to last for more than 30 seconds.

"I've read the scriptures of the church and there is no such profession as 'mage',"

Zhao Xu's mouth dropped open, and he wasn't even a member of the same family.

He had just started playing the game and really didn't want to join a knowledgeable clergy goddess, which was a pity.

"Oh, oh, I must have gotten it wrong, is it called a mentor instead?" Zhao Xu thought for a moment and brought out a near non-combat mage profession.

The four players across from him suddenly looked stunned, and Zhao Xu was really in need of their care.

A few days after the server started, some players found it difficult to adapt to the 11 basic adventure professions and switched to ordinary professions such as warriors, mentors, nobles, and experts.
Here is the translation:

The common trait among ordinary professionals is their weakness.
Lacking combat strength, this is already a relatively polite statement.
A few people began to understand, realizing that Zhao Xu was too shy to speak up and chose the profession of chicken farmer instead.
"That's fine, Mr. Zhongxiao, we'll gather at the time and location set by Mr. Lark tomorrow. Is there anything else?"
"No," Zhao Xu responded decisively.
"That's good, let's cooperate." Warrior Maple Leaf said.
At this point, he had already lost interest in understanding what kind of magic Mr. Zhongxiao was interested in.
