Chapter 494: Northern Territory Strategy

Until Anzhiya brought Zhao Xu back to the real world, he still had a hazy feeling in his mind.

This segment of time-traveling through thousands of years seemed like a minor "coincidence" to him, but Zhao Xu had already roughly felt the trembling of his soul.

He even suspected that he might have left some fragments of himself in the thousand-year period before the gods fell and a great calamity occurred.

The possibilities of "forgetting memories," "world assimilation," and "imprinting" made Zhao Xu realize that "time-traveling" was not as effortless as he had imagined.

This also made him re-examine the established fact that he could "reborn."

However, he had yet to unravel the "secret" that had puzzled him until now.

When they returned to the altar in the cave, Grazzit, the dark lord, had already escaped.

The scene was still shrouded in smoke, and the black, molten lava-like liquid that Grazzit had brought with him had cooled and solidified, covering the ground.

Perhaps at the moment Zhao Xu turned around to face the "time-space power" head-on, Grazzit, the dark lord, knew that his cunning plan had reached its limit.

This also gave Zhao Xu some sense of relief.

At that moment, Grazzit appeared behind Zhao Xu, stiff and motionless, which also revealed one thing.

The ability to manipulate time had exhausted all its action capacity.

Moreover, it was unable to control this ability, not only failing to activate it against Zhao Xu but also unable to activate it against Anzhiya.

At this point, Zhao Xu and Anzhiya carefully surveyed the dark altar in front of them.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can't be said that being brushed by Glazet has left Ansinoya with a fiery temper. "As it seems, it's probably not far from what you expected," Ansinoya said, looking at the stone tablet at the bottom of the altar, which was engraved with the text of the underworld. "This altar serves as a catalyst for summoning, and once successful, the summoned creatures will offer sacrifices to open the final transmission portal."

"This transmission portal that connects the deep abyss to the world of Arthur is a pleasure trip for the demons, but it marks the beginning of the suffering of the entire northern region," Zhao Xu sighed.

Arthur's strong warriors are many, but this refers to those at the high level.

As for the adventurers and soldiers in the northern region, including local defense forces, they will face demons born with superior qualities, from the timid demons to the six-armed snake demons and the Blaze Flame demons.

Unless Arthur mobilizes all his strength to help, these low-level demons will continue to swarm, and it's impossible to eliminate them. The only limit is the transmission portal's throughput.

Moreover, these demons have been fighting against the demons in the underworld and hell, and they have accumulated rich battle experience.

"No mistake," Ansinoya said with a slight frown. "The key is that Glazet left behind many hidden underground altars in the northern alliance, even if official forces intervene, it's difficult to find all these hidden underground altars."

"The underworld and the demon army are preparing to descend upon Arthur," Zhao Xu made a silent prophecy.

The neat stone tablet and the rough, non-human-made altar all suggest that these altars were mass-produced.

Behind it, there must be a massive organization continuously manipulating and operating."
For Arthur, the disaster that occurred years ago still brings him immense pain. A disaster that resulted in the death of every man in a small country, who were all born in the same year. For some demons, however, this disaster was a stepping stone to heaven, a way to secure their lives.

Some things are just brutally cruel.

Zhao Xu Ming knew that the hands of the underworld had already reached out to Arthur, but he was unable to pull them out, and could only watch as they spread out like cancer.

At this point, Zhao Xu Ming remembered the scene in the lair of the mutant scorpions, where he saw the "golden boxes" that Anzhiya had left behind, as well as the bodies suspended from the ceiling.

These suspended bodies were identical to the bodies hidden in the underground cave.

Zhao Xu Ming immediately told Anzhiya about this past event.

"It's just that," Anzhiya nodded, "the nephew of Tang De, who was sent to surround you, was probably the 'claw' of this force. But at the time, you had already cut it off."

"But this matter, I'm afraid they wouldn't want to draw attention from the church, so they just searched briefly and then stopped."

Zhao Xu Ming thought for a moment and understood Anzhiya's implied meaning.

Demons and evil spirits, who invaded the northern region during the seal of the underworld, were not an independent event. In fact, it was a kind of tacit agreement between the underworld and the abyssal evil lords.

Even the demons, it turned out, were not just limited to the evil king Grazt. The entire northern region must have had a "mysterious organization" connected to the lords of the underworld, and even Tang De was just a more obvious node in this network.

The Northern Alliance and the entire northern region had more than ten major forces involved in this network, which was far beyond what anyone had imagined.
Here is the translation of the text:

Looking at Zhao Xu's solemn expression, An Nuo Ya comforted him, "The Starfall Lake battle in the past was your first sword drawn in the north, and at that time, you could only rely on external forces."

"As for now, if you want to become the sword of invincibility like Arthur, you need to have the courage and daring to slowly lift the veil behind the scenes, making him become the test stone for you to walk towards legend."

"Otherwise, you think achieving legend is just a matter of leveling up and killing monsters, mastering a few spells and controlling a small part of the magical system, waiting for you to develop and use?"

An Nuo Ya, who saw through the actual altar, saw the other event provided by Zhao Xu, about the intention of the deep abyss and hell. She had guessed it with a high degree of accuracy.

After thinking about this point, Zhao Xu stood up, his eyes flashing with determination and anger.

The initial lack of clothing and food in the prehistoric era, as well as the subsequent sealing of the magic war, led to a catastrophic decline in the global population.

Not to mention the people of the entire earth, even the innocent civilians of the northland, suffered heavy losses.

Many small towns were reduced to desolate ruins, and some small cities were even transformed into the playgrounds of demons. Human bodies hung from the walls, and skeletal remains were stacked to form a sacrificial altar to appease the lords.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's heart tightened, as if an intangible force was grasping him tightly.

He spoke calmly, "Teacher, isn't it because the future Earth convergence point is located in the north of the Ice Mountain Range that this disaster has occurred here?"

An Nuo Ya looked at Zhao Xu with a gentle gaze, "From the moment the first legendary mage entered the Earth universe, the plan had the possibility of implementation, and even traced back to the aftermath of the great disaster, the covenant between the gods."
Here is the translation:

"On the other side of the crucible, they will naturally set up arrangements for this reason."

"Gods, they are preparing themselves for the 'Dusk Battle' in the future, accumulating enough believers. Similarly, the Abyss and Hell also need to stockpile souls as a reserve."

"They will invade Arthur, choosing the location where humans from Earth are crossing, only for maximum benefit."

"It's really unbearable to feel like a pawn or a pig being treated like one."

Zhao Xun couldn't help but laugh out loud, but his laughter seemed to be concealing some emotional explosion.

"Even if Arthur's main god has broken free from the limitations of believers, they will still develop their own gods and chosen people, constantly expanding their believers."

"The harvest land is here, and if you don't harvest this year's wheat, someone else will reap the harvest in the next season. A stronger farmer also has the capital to annex someone else's assets."

Anastasia pointed out the key to the eternal struggle of faith.

"This is also what he taught me. I don't want to be a farmer who harvests with a sickle or a peasant who toils in vain without a harvest. So I'll become a traveler, witnessing the rise and fall of Arthur, and the ups and downs of history."

"As long as I don't become a god, I won't be excluded from the will of the world and severed from Arthur. With my peak strength, I can wait for the world to come to an end. So I can witness the appearance of the third magic goddess today."

"Teacher, can the 17th dimensional interface also threaten your existence?" Zhao Xun couldn't help but ask curiously.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Definitely, but there are few exceptions, and some exist in the realm of concepts. Before you can understand how this world came to be, you will forever be unable to grasp the extent to which secrets are hidden in this world."

Anniya sighed.

"What are you going to do next? After verifying your identity in Auror City and obtaining supplies, what's your plan after returning to the Starfall Town?" 

Hao Xu replied with a sigh, "I didn't know before, so it's fine."

"Since we know that Tang De is the key, and there are networks of dark assistance surrounding it, I naturally want to eliminate it."

"Perhaps those who betrayed Arthur have their own reasons. They will loudly say that Arthur is no match for the powerful and hellish forces of the underworld, and that they are essentially sacrificing some inferior tribes to seek the continuation of the entire civilization's flame. But I think they are still going to go to the underworld and tell the devil about it."
