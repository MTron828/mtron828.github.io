Chapter 095: Truth

Zhao Xu was about to cast a spell when he suddenly felt a surge of excitement. He was only 2nd level?

He had started playing the game 8 months ago and reached 2nd level in 4 months. During that time, he mainly focused on completing quests and had not mastered the skills of a 2nd-level warrior. He had not grasped the concept of 2nd-level combat and could not reach the threshold of 2nd-level magic. He had also not mastered various weapons.

Now, he was suddenly able to break through to the 2nd-level threshold. If he solidified his foundation, he would become a prominent 2nd-level mage in the game.

Moreover, he could now pursue his second career path, which was a 1st-level scholar of mysterious scrolls.

Annie might be surprised to know that he had reached 2nd level and might even let him use the teleportation spell to return to receive training.

However, Zhao Xu's fantasy was short-lived, as he needed to deal with the living creature in front of him.

"Oh? You're about to counterattack me? How unfortunate. It seems I'll have to make the choice for you." Liren, the mage, suddenly snarled, pointing his hand at the ground.

"Whoosh!" The sound echoed, and Liren's finger shot out, and the Roia beside Zhao Xu suddenly turned into a cloud of dust.

The 6th-level disintegration spell, which could turn anything into dust, was being performed right in front of Zhao Xu.

Ordinary people would be shocked to see a living person suddenly disappear into dust right in front of them. However, Zhao Xu remained calm and composed.

"Eliminate all the impossible, and what's left is the truth, no matter how unbelievable it may be." Zhao Xu said this phrase, his tone calm and detached.
Here is the translation:

"When it's hard to believe in the evil you've caused, it's easy to think that everything is the world's fault, that everything is fake. But this self-comforting is not so bad."

Lawyer Ray didn't seem to care and chuckled.

"Where did my companion go?" Zhao Xu asked again.

He seemed to have not seen Ray's death at all, and directly questioned Ray, who was standing in front of him.

"Hmm?" Ray asked his first question, looking at Zhao Xu's serious expression.

He could tell that this was not an inquiry.

"These illusions of yours are really too crude," Zhao Xu explained.

Suddenly, all the scenery around them turned into fragments of nothingness, tearing apart like a simultaneous collapse of light. The darkness slowly receded, and the wizard Ray in front of him gradually transformed back into his original handsome appearance.

"Ah, you didn't even have any real knowledge, how could my 'eternal shadow' be exposed?" Ray sighed, bowing his head.

Behind him, about 40 meters away, there were seven people including Ray. They were blocked by an invisible barrier.

Everyone in the distance shouted and waved at Zhao Xu, but their voices couldn't reach this side.

"Don't look, they're being blocked by my silence and force field," Ray said. "Anyway, how did you see through my second illusion? My acting skills and illusions are seamless, aren't they?"

"Of course, those initial words about the curse wardkeeper were indeed not acting, I'm really jealous of you."

Zhao Xu frowned, but he didn't relax his guard. Instead, he raised his alertness to the highest level.

"Don't worry, you guys should actually improve your deception and reading people skills. Just now, you looked like you had a trump card that could kill me, and I almost wanted to know what Anzhiya gave you."

Note: Anzhiya is not mentioned in the original text, it seems to be a mistake. The correct translation should be "我差点想看看安缇诺雅到底给了你什么底牌" which means "I almost wanted to know what Anzhiya gave you". Anzhiya is not a character in the original story.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu heard the name of Anzhiya, he couldn't help but look at the eye-catching wizard, Lyren, with a hint of curiosity.

"Are you familiar with her? All the magical items she makes will have her mark on them. Take a look at the bottom of the staff, isn't it adorned with a girl's pattern?"

Zhao Xu heard this and smiled slightly, his embarrassment evident. From his Howard bag to the staff, there was this mark.

However, since the person in front of him knew Anzhiya, he must be safe, right?

"That's okay, can you let my companions come out too?" Zhao Xu tried to make a request.

"They don't have the qualification to listen to that, and I'm in a hurry. Let's hurry up and finish the conversation. This is not a place you can enter now," wizard Lyren said.

"You're who?" Zhao Xu, despite having many questions in his heart, still decided to ask the three big questions.

"Haha, who am I?"

Wizard Lyren shook his head, "I thought you would recognize me, this handsome teacher."

Suddenly, wizard Lyren's expression became serious, and he looked at Zhao Xu again with a deep gaze, his eyes filled with jealousy to a few degrees. "I said it, I said it, some people are born with it, and some people spend their whole life pursuing it. You don't recognize me? That means you're getting a private lesson from the moment you entered?"

Zhao Xu didn't dare to speak freely after hearing this.

These high-level wizards were just too knowledgeable and too perceptive. He couldn't expect Anzhiya's big flag to hold up for long.

After all, he had more profound secrets.

However, the silence lasted for a while before wizard Lyren didn't pursue it further. "I'm also stupid, Anzhiya gave you this thing, and you're definitely the final scroll system. Ha ha, it's really envious to the point of madness."
Here is the translation of the text:

Relying on a single sentence to introduce myself, I'm Rayn, a wizard who has made the wrong choice and is now atoning for my sins here.

After Rayn finished speaking, his expression fell somewhat.

"What choice did you make wrong?" Zhao Xu asked after hesitating for a moment.

Rayn lowered his head, "It's the same situation as yours, but I made the opposite choice."

"I had convinced myself that I could go back and use the Revival Spell to revive them, and it's better to die a few than to die a group. However, I was too young at the time, and some souls are not something you can get back. So I've been watching over them for a lifetime."

Zhao Xu looked at Rayn, but didn't say much, and he didn't stand on moral high ground to condemn him either.

Thinking about the altar of the High Priestess of the Moon in here, Zhao Xu had a faint understanding of what was going on.

"How did you get here?" Rayn asked Zhao Xu in turn.

Zhao Xu's face stiffened, and he smiled wryly, saying, "I heard there were big secrets here, so I came to take a look on my way. Time is urgent, and I didn't do much investigation before coming."

"Really brave adventurers," Rayn shook his head, "The miners dug up some things here, and I happened to come by to take a look. Who knew that the power of the abyss also paid attention to this place, and caught me off guard."

"However, after all these years, I've also found some clues about the things dug up back then."

"What kind of clues?" Zhao Xu asked, following Rayn's train of thought.

"Of course, it's the secret of King Ernest of the Arcane. Ernest, haven't you heard of him? He sat on the throne when you awakened, and it's rumored that he had a relationship with the First Magic Goddess."
