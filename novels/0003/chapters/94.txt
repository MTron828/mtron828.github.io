Chapter 95: The Truth

Zhao Xu was about to cast a spell when he suddenly felt a shock. Did I just level up to 2nd grade?

He had only reached 2nd grade after 8 months of playing the game, and it took him 4 months to get there. During that time, he mainly focused on completing quests and didn't master the skills of a 2nd-grade warrior. He couldn't even grasp the threshold of 2nd-grade attacks, and his proficiency with various weapons was mediocre.

Now, he was about to cast a spell, and suddenly he had broken through to the 2nd-grade limit.

He thought to himself that he should solidify his foundation, and he would become a top-notch 2nd-grade mage among players.

Moreover, he could finally start his second career path, which was a 1st-grade priest after becoming a 1st-grade priest himself. He imagined that if Anzinoja found out he had reached 2nd grade, she would probably let him use the teleportation spell to rush back and receive training.

However, Zhao Xu's fantasy would have to wait, as he first needed to deal with the biological creature in front of him.

"Oh? You're just about to attack me? That's a shame. It seems I need to make you understand that you didn't choose, so I'll choose for you." The mage Ray suddenly sneered and pointed at the ground.

"Thud" was the sound, and Ray's body, which was standing beside Zhao Xu's feet, suddenly turned into countless flying dust.

This 6th-grade spell, "Disintegration", could turn everything into flying dust. It was being performed right in front of Zhao Xu.

Ordinary people would be driven mad by the sight of a living person disappearing into thin air right in front of them, turning into dust.

However, Zhao Xu remained calm and detached, looking at the situation before him.

"Remove all the impossible, and what's left, no matter how unimaginable, is the truth." Zhao Xu said the famous phrase with a hint of sarcasm, "Too deliberate a clue."
Here is the translation:

"When it's hard to believe in the evil you've caused, it's easy to think that everything is the world's fault, everything is fake. This self-consolation is not bad at all," said the wizard Ryan with a carefree smile.

"Where did my companions go?" asked Zhao Xu again.

He seemed not to have seen Ryan's death at all, and directly questioned Ryan, who was standing in front of him.

"Hmm?" Ryan asked for the first time with a puzzled expression.

He could tell from Zhao Xu's serious expression that this was not a probe.

"These illusions of yours are really too amateurish," said Zhao Xu.

Suddenly, the entire sky and landscape crumbled into fragments like a burst of light, and the darkness slowly receded. Ryan's evil scales on his body slowly disappeared, revealing his original handsome appearance.

"Ah, you don't even have true knowledge, how did my 'eternal illusion' get discovered?" Ryan sighed, lowering his head.

Behind him, about 40 meters away, the seven people, including Luo Ya, were blocked by an invisible barrier.

Everyone stared at Zhao Xu, shouting and waving their hands, but their voices couldn't be heard on this side.

"Don't look, I've silenced them with my silence and powerful spell," said Ryan. "Say, how did you see through my second illusion? My acting and illusion were seamless, weren't they?"

"Certainly, those initial words about the curse guardian were indeed not acting, I'm really jealous of you."

Zhao Xu furrowed his brow, but didn't relax his guard, on the contrary, he raised his alertness to the utmost.

"Don't worry, you guys really need to improve your skills in deceiving and reading people's faces. Just now, you looked like you had the upper hand and could kill me with a single blow, making me wonder what kind of trump card Anzhiya gave you."
Here is the translation of the text:

When Zhao Xu heard the name of Anzhi Noya, he couldn't help but gaze at the mage Lyren in front of him with a mixture of curiosity.

"Are you familiar with the source of this magic item? Look at the bottom of the staff, is there a floral pattern in a girl's style?"

Zhao Xu heard this sentence and smiled slightly, feeling a bit awkward. He took out a staff from his Howard bag and saw that it had the same mark.

However, since the person in front of him knew Anzhi Noya, it seemed that he was safe.

"That's fine, can I release my companions?" Zhao Xu tried to make a request.

"The rest of the conversation is not for them to hear, and I'm in a hurry, so let's finish up and get out of here. This place is not for you to enter now."

Mage Lyren said.

"What are you?" Zhao Xu, despite having countless doubts in his heart, still decided to ask the three classic questions.

"Ah ha, what am I?"

Mage Lyren shook his head, "I thought you would recognize me, the handsome teacher you've seen before."

Suddenly, Mage Lyren's expression turned solemn, and he looked at Zhao Xu with deep concern. "I'll say it, I'll say it, there are some people who are born with certain things, and some people spend their whole life pursuing them. You don't recognize me? That means you came here alone for a private lesson?"

After hearing this, Zhao Xu didn't dare to speak carelessly.

These high-level mages knew too much and were too perceptive. He didn't expect Anzhi Noya's flag to hold up for much longer.

After all, he had more profound secrets.

However, after a moment of silence, Mage Lyren didn't pursue the matter further. "I'm also foolish, Anzhi Noya gave you this thing, you're definitely the ultimate scroll system, ah ha, it's really envious and infuriating."
Here is the translation of the text:

Lien, a wizard who made a wrong choice, is staying here to atone. After saying this, Lien's expression fell slightly.

"What wrong choice?" Zhao Xu asked after a moment's hesitation.

Lien looked down, his voice low, "It's the same situation as yours, but I made the opposite choice."

"I thought at the time that I could revive them with the Revival spell and that it was better to revive a few rather than none. But I was too young and naive back then. Some souls are not retrievable. So I've been watching over them for a lifetime."

Zhao Xu looked at Lien without saying much, nor did he scold him from a moral high ground.

Thinking of the altar of Diemo God, Zhao Xu seemed to have vaguely understood something.

"How did you get here?" Lien asked Zhao Xu.

Zhao Xu's face stiffened, and he smiled wryly, "I heard there were great secrets here, so I just came to take a look. Time is tight, and I didn't investigate much."

"Really brave adventurers," Lien shook his head, "The miners dug up some things here, and I just happened to pass by to take a look. Who knew the deep power was also paying attention to this place and got me caught off guard."

"However, after all these years, I've also found some clues about the things dug up back then."

"What clues?" Zhao Xu asked, following Lien's train of thought.

"Of course, it's the secret of King Ernest of Ahria. Haven't you heard of him? He's said to have had a relationship with the first goddess of magic."

As Lien spoke, he gestured with his finger.
