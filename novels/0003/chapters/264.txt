Chapter 265: The Advent of the Players

Upon hearing these words, the audience, who had previously assumed that the players from Earth would engage in a long and arduous battle with the "Cataclysmic Lake" Mining Association, were left in utter astonishment.

Especially those who had attended the prayer ceremony at the church today, who were not insignificant in number.

As soon as they heard the news, the nobles who had been participating in the ceremony hastily bowed their heads and apologized, then quickly returned home to reorganize their strategy.

As for the middle-aged pastor, he trembled with emotion as he led Zhao Xu to the VIP room.

It was impossible for the goddess to manifest directly above the Cataclysmic Lake, but rather it must be one of her chosen ones who had taken action.

Even so, to spread the magical effects to every player in the Cataclysmic Lake, such a feat was exaggerated and frightening.

Before the middle-aged pastor could ask another question, Zhao Xu had already taken a few steps forward.

It wasn't until Zhao Xu entered the VIP room that he discovered that Xiao Si, whom he had not seen for over a month, was now standing there with a confident air.

Unlike his previous cautious demeanor in the "Holy Heart Cathedral" of Mistral.

As Xiao Si saw Zhao Xu walking towards him, he quickly stood up and extended his hand, saying, "Welcome, Mr. Zhong Xia, it's been a while since we've seen each other."

At this moment, Zhao Xu, facing the "Archbishop" who controlled the entire city, did not show excessive humility, simply nodding slightly towards Xiao Si.

Perhaps, Zhao Xu, who was currently representing, was not just an ordinary pastor.
Here is the translation of the text:

He is also the "ally" of Aloth, the most noble angel in the god's kingdom.

"Mr. Sosi, I'm here mainly to ask you for something," Zhao Xuan said straight to the point.

Sosi looked at Zhao Xuan's expression and nodded silently, saying, "Don't worry, I already sent an urgent notice to the priestess of Winter's Castle this morning. As long as you're leading the team, we can mobilize the 'Sacred Knight Order' and the 'Priesthood' under your command."

At this moment, Sosi was expecting Zhao Xuan's joyful expression, but instead, he got a headshake from Zhao Xuan.

At the same time, a novice hurried over to knock on the door, saying, "Starfall Lake Battlefield, we have new developments."

Sosi was about to call out to the person to come in, but suddenly remembered that Zhao Xuan was sitting across from him, so he gave up asking the outsider and said directly, "Wait until later to report."

"No need, the players are now in a dominant position, and it's estimated that we can break through the city gates soon, so we don't need to worry about it," Zhao Xuan said, declining the other's help.

After hearing Zhao Xuan's response, Sosi was taken aback, muttering, "How can players possibly beat the frost giants with an average challenge level above 10 levels?"

"I used a miracle, allowing my spell to affect everyone in the room," Zhao Xuan explained lightly.

At this moment, Sosi, who had just lifted the colorful tea cup, almost spilled the hot tea in his hand.

However, Zhao Xuan changed the topic to the purpose of his visit today.

He took out a "Secret Silver Crystal" from his pocket, which he had exchanged for it from the master of the jade star.
Here is the translation:

"I need you to help me acquire a silver vein after the auction in the upcoming Starfall town mining competition," said Zhao Xu to the Abbot of the Order of the Silver Crystal.

"...But what if the Abbot secretly takes the 'Silver Crystal' for himself?" asked Lark to Zhao Xu.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already returned and was observing the players' attack on Starfall town.

In reality, the morale of the Starfall town guards had already collapsed, and they were unable to resist the players' intentions.

On the one hand, the profound influence brought about by the divine intervention was a factor.

On the other hand, the players' rapid progress in strength also proved the disparity in strength.

"'The Abbot won't dare to take anything from me,' Zhao Xu said confidently.

"How is that possible?" Lark said with skepticism, "After all, you don't have a close relationship with the Abbot, and even if he does take something, you have nowhere to turn to."

In reality, the conversation between Zhao Xu and the Abbot from start to finish was him giving instructions, which was why Lark felt confused.

"He knows some inside information," Zhao Xu said, looking at the players who had already reached the city wall and were attacking the towers.

"It's because he cannot determine whether this is the will of the goddess or just our own feelings."

Zhao Xu later returned to Mistral and naturally could not manage the mine, nor could he keep an eye on the mine and participate in the upcoming mine auction.

As for entrusting it to Zhang Qi, that was a real test of character, so Zhao Xu had already decided to entrust it to the Abbot from the beginning.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It was Zhao Xu's two moves that made everyone think that the goddess's influence had begun to intervene in the entire Star Lake. This also led many people to speculate about the goddess's support for the player's actions this time. However, regardless of the outcome, it meant that the goddess had completely intervened in the political ecology of the Star Lake town in the "Winter City" church.

At this time, the player flew over the city wall and entered from above, counterattacking and clearing out the internal enemies quickly. The speed of clearing out the enemies was fast, and soon the main city gate was fully opened.

Zhang Qi was also advancing in the crowd, holding a shield to protect his girlfriend.

"What's strange is that the 4th-level mage 'Star Void Reflection' suddenly ascended into the air and then rushed to this Star Lake, and then ignored everything," someone said.

"Maybe the other side has their own reasons," Cui Lu explained.

In reality, Zhao Xu did not personally leave with the players to fight together, but instead cast a fireball spell and then rushed towards Star Lake town.

This made him, who did not have a personal stake in the "Counterattack Alliance", suddenly reveal a vulnerability that left people speechless.

"Who knows, maybe he was scared," a wandering player mocked, his hands holding two broken blades that rang out with a dull sound.

"How is that possible? It's just that 'Star Void Reflection' has more important things to do," a few fans of the players protested, saying that.

However, they were just a minority, unable to reverse other people's opinions.

Suddenly, the crowd of players waiting at the city gate erupted in a commotion, only to recover to silence again.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Qi looked at the faint waves of sound in front of him, and for a moment, he didn't know what was going on. He quickly grabbed his girlfriend's hand to prevent her from being pushed away by the crowd.

"What's going on?" his girlfriend, Cui Lu, felt the same sense of unease as she looked at the crowd in front of her.

Suddenly, Du Nan, who was leaning against the wall, pushed his way back through the crowd with great effort. His face was red and sweaty, and he was panting heavily.

"What's going on ahead?" Zhang Qi asked.

At this moment, everyone began to tense up and prepare for something unexpected.

Du Nan, still panting, shouted across the crowd to Zhang Qi, "The forum has received a new warning about the jump clause!"

As soon as Du Nan spoke, the noisy discussion in the area fell silent, and everyone's eyes were fixed on him.

"What does that mean?" Zhang Qi asked, not understanding the situation.

"The 'Starfall' has reached level 5, and the second-ranked 3-star warrior has been promoted two levels. As a result, the clause has been reactivated, and the list of 3-star players has been released," Du Nan explained.

As soon as the players heard this, they couldn't help but look at their character cards again.

However, the "1-star" label was still glaringly obvious.

At this moment, the departure of the other party became insignificant, as they had opened up a new milestone for the player community. Even the significance of the Starfall Lake was overshadowed by the impact of this level on the players.

Suddenly, the crowd of players gathered at the city gate was shaken to the core, like a bomb had been dropped, by the news.
As the "Star Sky Reflection" flew towards the Starfall Town, it directly ascended to level 5.

It seemed to be mocking everyone's slow leveling speed. Some players suddenly felt that the success of the city siege was very uninteresting at this moment.

"It turns out that the '5' on the back is referring to level 5," a player suddenly had a moment of enlightenment.

The group of players preparing to enter the city was suddenly plunged into a state of silence.
