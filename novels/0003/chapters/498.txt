Chapter 499: The Killing Intent from Behind

As the air escaped from the torn trachea, Oscar's eyes were filled with terror. The pain of being unable to breathe made his lungs feel like they were being crushed by a stone.

He tried to make a sound, but it was of no use.

Under Zhao Xu's control of his powerful attack, Oscar's sword had precisely destroyed his vocal cords, leaving him to constantly open and close his throat, but unable to control it.

In the flash of cold light, Oscar even found it hard to imagine why his plan, which had always gone smoothly, had been directly crushed by Zhao Xu.

It was as if the other party had never considered his "secret method" of rapid promotion.
Even Arthur, who had sworn to live a poor life, would not relax his profession's level of strength.

Only strong power could guarantee one's basic right to breathe. A random monster that wandered into the village could cause the destruction of several households.

Looking at the opponent's consciousness still lingering, Zhao Xu glanced at the character card and his faith coordinates on the axis of good.
He then executed the judgment and sentenced the prisoner Oscar, who was guilty of ten crimes, to death on the spot, causing him to wander further away from the chaotic camp and leaving his coordinates on the axis of good largely unchanged.

As for the underground leader of the underground city of Oulu, Zhao Xu's choice was to use a legendary death-dealing staff to imprison his soul, because the opponent still had a memory of a hidden storage location of the entire underground force's backing funds, and he needed to interrogate the soul.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Oscar chose to end it all, Zhao Xu had already returned to the driver's seat of the carriage, with Oscar desperately trying to reach out and cover his wound, but being unable to move due to being bound tightly.

He could only listen to the approaching sound of death's bell.

"'Arthur's rules are many, but two are fundamentally unchanged throughout eternity.'"

"'One is that everything is three.'"

"'The other is the principle of equal exchange.'"

Zhao Xu seemed to be speaking to the empty air in front of him, but each sentence pierced Oscar's heart.

"'You once obtained it from the devil, a remedy made from human hearts, which not only alleviates your illness and accelerates your leveling, but also has a huge cost.'"

Oscar's voice was getting closer and closer, and Zhao Xu could clearly hear the prisoner's consciousness about to depart.

"'That remedy is essentially a devil's ritual, the key part being the ritual, which allows you to exchange your life for leveling up quickly, and then locks you away, effectively reducing your lifespan to just a few years.'"

"'By the way, I'll tell you, a human heart is not necessary at all.'"

Zhao Xu spoke indifferently, "'It's just to make you kill, and your soul will gradually decay. You'll spread a foul stench just like the same kind of creatures.'"

"'Otherwise, how could you smoothly descend into the abyss?'"

As Zhao Xu spoke, he looked at Oscar with a pitying gaze for the first time, "'In the bottomless abyss, do you know what the lowest-level monster is?'"

"'It's not the devil that looks like a lump of rotten flesh, which has at least a 2-level challenge.'"
Here is the translation of the text in English:

"At the very bottom are the 'Original Demons', a level 1 'Original Demon' that can only contribute to the abyss by providing a despicable hatred emotion towards surrounding objects."

"They are often found in the cities of the abyss, where they are either consumed as food or sold as slaves, or become prey in the hunting grounds of evil demons, or simply wander aimlessly, searching for the end of a life without hope."

"The Original Demons are the lowest form of evil demons, and their origins are from the chaotic and evil human souls that have transformed into external shells."

When Zhao Xu said that the key to gaining demon power is not the heart but the ritual, Oscar's eyes had already revealed a look of terror.

As Zhao Xu sentenced Oscar to death, not the end, he would become the lowest level 'Original Demon', which was his eternal destiny, and Oscar's heart was filled with terror.

But it was already too late.

After Oscar's death, Zhao Xu turned around and raised his hand, casting a "Mage's trick" to clear the bloodstained ground.

He said, "You're dead," and then struck with his sword, which was too generous.

Zhao Xu was angry with Oscar's crimes and decided to let him understand the miserable fate that awaited him after death, which was his answer to the evil in the world.

At the same time, he was also thinking about the promise given to him by the leader of the alliance, Tang De, which was made under the watchful eyes of the high-ranking officials.

As long as the hostage could be rescued smoothly, many soldiers would sacrifice their lives, even sacrificing everything for the entire alliance, but they would not be able to get a small piece of land, which would fall into Zhao Xu's hands.

In the background of the brutal kidnapping of the leaders of the alliance and their wives, it seemed reasonable for Zhao Xu to receive the Starlight Town, which was a bit too much to ask."
Here is the translation:

However, Zhao Xu's suspicions are not directed at Tang De's motivations, but rather at the motivations of the six sisters.

Regardless, Oscar, who has exhausted his potential, will not be a priority for the six sisters.

However, Zhao Xu will not take rash action even if he lacks information at the moment.

Now, his top priority is to rescue Freya and Mrs. Elly.

Whether Tang De is sincere or insincere, it makes no difference.

After the battle of Star Lake, which was influenced by the will of Xisilvina, the basic faith of Star Lake has largely fallen under the control of the Goddess of Magic. Based on this point, the Association of Mages has specially arranged for local chapters to be set up.

As a pastor, Zhao Xu has essentially brought the power of the church under his control, thanks to his relationship with the Archbishop of Winter City.

As a result, Zhao Xu has taken on the role of president of the Association and has acquired the right to govern the local area.

So, Zhao Xu has been adjusting his plans and constantly thinking about the layout of Star Lake.

He has already sensed the "Earth Crossing" aura and is gradually taking steps. For the time being, he won't have too many actions besides exploring the surroundings.

Managing Star Lake will make it the most solid and reliable fallback for players who cross over, becoming a crucial link in Zhao Xu's plans.

Suddenly, as Zhao Xu was traveling along the road to the Ice Mountain Range, he subtly sensed a shadowy figure moving forward in the snow ahead.

He immediately slowed down the horse's speed and, from the bottom of the carriage, pulled out a pure white rabbit that seemed to blend seamlessly with the sky and earth.

Zhao Xu pulled out dried food and silently performed the two-ring divine art to share his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

The originally bewildered rabbit suddenly opened its mouth, swallowed the meat snacks in its hand, and then leaped forward, sprinting wildly across the snowy field.

In the blink of an eye, thanks to the magical power, Zhao Xu acquired a sense of vision and smell similar to that of a wolf, allowing him to observe the world.

His field of vision suddenly switched to the rabbit's body, and he began to sprint forward, following its gaze across the snowy landscape.

The snow-covered landscape before him seemed to be a carefully laid trap, like a six-sisterly conspiracy.

This situation was beyond Zhao Xu's expectations, and he would not have planned it this way, even if he had wanted to.

However, as the surrounding cold air grew quiet, Zhao Xu began to sense a killing intent emanating from the rabbit's innocent-looking eyes.

In an instant, a dark shadow swooped down, and he felt his field of vision spinning wildly.

The next moment, his field of vision turned black, and Zhao Xu struggled to distinguish the red, membranous scene before him.

It was as if he had swallowed a mouthful of throat, and the magic connection was lost a few seconds later.

Zhao Xu's face turned pale, and he felt a sense of unease.

Just as he had calmly observed the whirlwind of the rabbit's field of vision, which did not pose any life-threatening danger to him, he saw a hundred or so winter wolves and a few frost giants lurking in his path.

Awaiting him on his journey.

Zhao Xu suddenly swung his whip, and the horse let out a loud whinny, before taking off at full gallop.

For Zhao Xu, it was no challenge to wipe out hundreds of winter wolves.
Here is the translation of the text:

With the help of his "extremely effective" and "twin-born" fireball magic, he could even wipe out the entire pack of winter wolves. However, he didn't want to reveal his true strength to the six sisters.

In an instant, Zhao Xu controlled the horse-drawn carriage and sped towards the Ice Mountain Range.

In theory, climbing the Ice Mountain Range during the winter was a suicidal endeavor.

After crossing the Ice Mountain Range, there were countless beastmen tribes and half-beastmen clans in the Bosong Plains, who were more ferocious and courageous than humans. They couldn't even cross the Ice Mountain Range during the summer, let alone the winter.

Even the cunning and powerful "Northern Hunters" would only venture into the Ice Mountain Range to gather information on the giant ice giants, white dragons, and winter wolves, and then report back to the alliance.

According to legend, during times of scarcity, the elderly were sent to die in the Ice Mountain Range.

Therefore, the Ice Mountain Range was seen as a death zone by the residents of the North.

The six sisters, apart from their powerful strength, also had a large number of subordinates, and had managed to avoid being wiped out by establishing their lair on the Ice Mountain Range.

Their first destination was also the Mirror Heart Lake, which was located on the Ice Mountain Range.

Zhao Xu was driving the horse-drawn carriage, speeding through the snow-covered land, and soon, a large number of winter wolves emerged from behind him.

He looked back, almost sighing.

Indeed, there were hundreds of winter wolves, rushing towards them.

Zhao Xu immediately deployed several spells, such as levitating the carriage and reducing the burden on the horses, allowing him to maintain a distance from the winter wolves behind him.

However, even after doing so, he couldn't shake off the doubts in his mind.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu thought to himself, no matter who wants to harm him, he shouldn't summon a group of winter wolves because he can't be killed, as long as he flies back to the high altitude. Although he may lose his sight due to the wind and snow, these powerless winter wolves won't be able to do anything to him.

"Whoosh."

A massive stone was thrown from behind, coming from the giant of frost, and was heading in the opposite direction due to the strong wind, failing to catch up with Zhao Xu's horse-drawn carriage.

Not good.

Zhao Xu suddenly woke up, turned around, and looked at the corpse of Oscar in the carriage, which had become icy cold.

It seems that the "leader's authority" in Starfall Town is not as easy to take as thought.

Or maybe this is just the first course in an endless series of traps.

Some people don't want to give the living Oscar to the Six Sisters.

Or maybe they don't want Freya and Lady Elly to return.

Within the alliance, there exists a mysterious force that can communicate with the Ice Mountain Range, and it intends to eliminate the "hostage" demanded by the Six Sisters.

However, Zhao Xu's heart also hardened at this moment.

He intends to take the "leader's authority".

This will also greatly help him establish a chapter of the association, so everyone who dares to block his way will be eliminated by him.

Zhao Xu immediately adjusted his route, constantly looking ahead at the location of the icy gorge, and continued to move forward.

This is the most treacherous path to the Ice Mountain Range, where one misstep would send him tumbling down the cliff, or even be pierced by ice shards and crushed to pieces.
