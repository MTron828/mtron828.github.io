Chapter 532: The Forgotten People of the Italer Kingdom

Everyone in the scene understood what had happened when they saw the humble demeanor of the town's chief of police, Kechi. "This is too low-level, even for a pig eating a tiger," someone said. "What's the point of dressing up as a private investigator?" another person asked. "I finally saw a plot twist like 'visiting the dragon king' in a new media novel," someone else remarked. "Is it possible that they planned the storyline in advance? It's too coincidental," someone else wondered.

The town's residents were taken aback by the haughty demeanor of the "Zhongxia" noble. Although they might find him unimpressive, they would still maintain a humble attitude when facing him in person. However, the players who were not familiar with the situation did not hesitate to mock the noble's behavior when they saw it.

As the atmosphere in the scene gradually turned cold and stern, the onlookers began to realize that the situation was not what it seemed. Meanwhile, Zhao Xu, who had the "right to rule," was calmly watching the many town law enforcement officials who had arrived. He even recognized a few familiar faces among them.

As the ruler of the town and chairman of the association, Zhao Xu was accustomed to being high above the rest. He had always believed that it was his due. To install his own people in power, he only needed to cultivate his own talent over a period of one or two years and then gradually replace the existing officials. This was the same strategy he had used when he was the chief of police.
Here is the translation:

The players have conquered the Mine Owner's Association's "Falling Star Town", causing a major reshuffle in this small town, with many positions now held by players.

However, three months later, the era changed with the Earth's passage, and he must have a "Falling Star Town" from head to toe, with every detail being his heart's desire.

For those who may not be familiar with the situation, he can only apologize.

Don't call him Lord, don't call him Dad, it's useless.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and said, "Given the performance I've seen, I think it's necessary to hold a town hall meeting to re-discuss the election of the town's law enforcement officer."

At this moment, the members of the town's law enforcement team, who had been slowly gathering outside, had almost completely surrounded the square. Everyone looked lost.

It can be said that with this one puff of smoke, the entire law enforcement system's backbone had gathered here.

Even before Zhao Xu's proposal was discussed and decided at the town hall meeting, Law Enforcement Officer Keji's face turned white.

He had realized that his efforts over the past 20 years had been reduced to nothing.

Keji's lips trembled, but he didn't know what to say.

If Zhao Xu proposes this resolution at the town hall meeting, the town's high-ranking officials will do their best to block it.

Because no one dares to give up the "Lord's Authority" and occupy the "Administrative Authority".
Otherwise, the Northern Alliance will not be called an alliance, but a kingdom.

But this time, in front of all the law enforcement team members, this Lord of the Summer opened his mouth, which means this is no longer a position issue.
It's even a question of "face".
It's so serious that even the highest-ranking officials in the alliance can no longer stand by.
Here is the translation of the text:

Kechi, who had been the de facto ruler of the small town for over a decade, couldn't help but wonder if this decision was worth it. His opponent could have taken years to secretly gather allies and then strike back, and he would have a clear opportunity to step down with dignity.

Why couldn't there be a stalemate? Kechi clenched his teeth, but didn't dare to speak out.

As he knew all too well, the head of the association's power and influence were unparalleled, and he could sense the extent of his authority.

"I'll accept this decision," Kechi said, bowing his head and submitting his resignation.

Just then, one of his loyal followers shouted loudly, "No, sir!"

Immediately, a muscular black-bearded warrior drew his large sword and shouted, "I refuse! Why must we sacrifice our lives for this outcome?"

Kechi's emotional appeal sparked a chain reaction, and the ten or so loyal followers who followed him, unable to bear the "hot-blooded" scene, drew their curved swords and shouted, "We swear to share our fate with our commander!"

The alliance was located in the northern region, which was perpetually shrouded in ice and snow, especially near the mountain range. The harsh environment had given rise to the fierce and martial culture.

The sound of the sword being drawn, like a domino effect, spread instantly.

Zhao Xuan was also taken aback. He had anticipated this scenario, but it was too easy to achieve. It seemed that his investment had paid off.

At this moment, Zhao Xuan looked at Kechi and shook his head with a smile.

He wasn't just seeking to replace Kechi, but the entire law enforcement team of the small town.

The right to govern was his area of expertise in the past and the foundation of the town's administrative power.
Here is the translation of the text:

He didn't think about splitting up with anyone, and it was clear that he would eat alone from start to finish.

As he saw the abnormal laughter of Zhongxia, Kechi was initially satisfied with his last-minute emotional performance in front of these colleagues, but he reacted instantly.

The opponent was on the fifth floor.

Kechi had realized that this was not just about his own descendants, but the entire system needed to be thoroughly cleaned.

He didn't care how he showed off, it was only for the group of "former law enforcement team members" to see.

"Fast---" Kechi shouted urgently.

However, before he could finish saying "draw sword", the one standing behind him, Zhao Xu, had already completed the last action with the "Super Momentary Release Rod" in his hand.

The four-ring magic "Black Tentacle".

In this instant, Zhao Xu officially revealed his pride as the leader to these people, including the patrol officers and the spectators around him, who were watching the commotion.

As the former officer Kechi, he had just called out to his descendants who were following him, but they could only silently watch as the originally peaceful underground suddenly burst out with countless three-meter-long "Black Tentacles".

What was even more terrifying was that these tentacles had an attack ability equivalent to Zhao Xu's magical level, which was simply legendary in power!

Each strike from these tentacles was like a legendary warrior wielding a sword, and no one could avoid it.

Even the strongest warriors and most agile fighters would be caught and tightly wrapped up by these black tentacles, then presented in a hanging posture.

This area with a radius of 6.5 meters was the only place where no one could stand calmly.

These proud and arrogant law enforcement officers, who were used to flaunting their authority, were all wrapped up by the tentacles and completely unable to move.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What? This giant tentacle play is going on, but unfortunately, I can't record it."

"Oh, come on, the sky of this small town is about to change."

The veteran adventurer who thought he had seen it all sighed.

"Well, the head of the public security bureau didn't come to the rescue in time, did he? How did he get fired?"

"That's simple, because he just got off the horse with his left foot."

"This isn't just a trivial matter, is it?"

"No mistake, he was in the way of the lord's path, which is his biggest sin."

"Don't worry, he won't cause a commotion among these officials because you'll see plenty of new faces tomorrow."

"I don't know if the lord can keep it under control."

The players who had experience in management looked at each other with concern.

Managing a few people is one thing, but managing tens of people or even hundreds is a whole different story, let alone reselecting these people.

In everyone's eyes, the lord of the summer had never recognized more than 50 people in the small town.

Zhou Xiu then instructed Kai Qi, "Go notify the town management committee, I want to hold an emergency meeting."

The next moment, a long and distant dragon's roar echoed from the sky, growing clearer.

"Oh!"

"What's going on?"

"Ah! The fear effect! What's happening?"

Many people who were watching the show clutched their heads and knelt down, as if they had received a tremendous shock from within.

At that time, a shadow slowly covered the crowd from above.

As they looked, a silver dragon with scales as white as snow, its wings fluttering, gently landed in front of the empty land before Zhou Xiu.

The airflow continued to blow from the ground, causing some weak individuals to take a step back.
Here is the translation of the text:

These officers who were controlled by the dark tendrils, although they were also invaded by fear, were still proud and thought to themselves, "The leader has just struck us, so we'll have to rely on our own magical abilities to overcome the dragon's magical resistance."

This speculation was spreading among the onlookers.

However, this massive white dragon was lowering its head in submission to Zhao Xu, offering its humility.

...When Zhao Xu returned to his temporary wooden hut, he found that Anzhi Nora was also in his room, and there was an old man standing beside her, stooping over.

The old man was thin and had bony arms, with deep wrinkles on his face, as if he had lived for many years.

Despite this, the old man exuded a sense of grandeur.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but observe the old man carefully, who had more than 28 points of intelligence and was no longer the Wu Xiaomeng he had known in his youth. He could even recall his school days with effort.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "You're the mysterious old man who gave me the 'Automatic Recording Quill'?"

The old man suddenly smiled, his face creasing with wrinkles. "I'm delighted you still remember me, Zhong Xiaoshi."

Zhao Xu looked at the old man and then at Anzhi Nora, who was standing beside him with an expressionless face, and asked curiously, "Do you two know each other?"

"Or rather, who are you?" he added.

Just then, the old man nodded slightly to Zhao Xu and said, "As the adopted brother of the princess, I, Zhong Xiaoshi, beg to express my respect."

"My name is Ettore Matthews," the old man said.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but open his mouth slightly. "This Ettore, the founder of the Ettore Empire, is the same name."

"Not at all," said the old man, Matthews.
