Chapter 532: The Forgotten People of the Itier Kingdom

As everyone in the scene realized what was happening, they couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. "This is too low-level," someone said. "It's like they're trying to make a report on a private investigation." "I've finally seen a plotline like 'visiting the dragon king' in a new media novel," someone else joked.

The locals of the small town looked at the "Zhong Xia" (仲夏) with disdain, even though they felt he was inferior. However, the players, who thought it was too boring, couldn't help but mock the scene, despite Zhong Xia being the first person.

As the atmosphere in the scene gradually became more tense, the audience began to realize that the situation was not as simple as it seemed. At this moment, Zhao Xu was looking at the many town law enforcement officers who had just arrived, and even recognized a few familiar faces from the future.

As the person with the power of a lord, Zhao Xu had not yet obtained the real power of a feudal lord, but he was still far removed from the common people. It was as if he was trying to intimidate these people, but it was just a waste of time.

As a lord and the chairman of the association, he should be above everyone else. If he wanted to install his own people, he could cultivate his own followers in just a year or two and then gradually replace them.

Zhao Xu had done the same thing when he was in the position of an officer in charge of law and order.
Here is the translation of the text:

Players have conquered the "Fallen Star Town" controlled by the Mine Owner's Association, causing a major shuffle in the town and resulting in many positions being filled by player characters.

However, three months later, the era has changed, and he must have a comprehensive and thorough "Fallen Star Town" that is his heart's desire.

For those who may not understand the situation, he can only apologize.

Even if he calls himself the Lord or Daddy, it won't work.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

"Considering your performance, I think it's necessary to hold a town hall meeting to re-discuss the selection of the town's law enforcement officer," he said, scanning the surroundings.

At this moment, the members of the town's law enforcement team, who had been slowly gathering in the square, had almost surrounded the entire area. The atmosphere was tense.

As Zhao Xu spoke, even before the "town hall meeting" had been discussed and decided, the law enforcement officer, Keiji, turned pale.

He had realized that his efforts over the past 20 years had been in vain.

Keiji's lips quivered, but he didn't know what to say.

If Zhao Xu proposed this resolution at the meeting, the town's high-ranking officials would do their best to block it.

Because no one dare to give up the "right to leadership" and occupy the "administrative right".

Otherwise, the Northern Alliance would not be called an alliance, but a kingdom.

However, in front of all the law enforcement team members, this Lord Summer opened his mouth, which meant that the issue was no longer just a position, but a question of "face".

It even reached the level of the alliance's high-ranking officials, and this Lord Summer could stand firm.

After dominating the small town for over a decade, Kechi, the leader, couldn't help but wonder if this decision was worth it. His opponent could have easily spent years building a network and waiting for the right moment to take him down.

Why couldn't there be a straightforward situation where one didn't have to fight to the death? Kechi gritted his teeth, but didn't dare to speak out.

As the head of the association, Kechi knew the extent of the leader's power and influence. He decided to accept the decision and immediately submitted his resignation to the higher-ups.

Just then, Kechi's loyal followers shouted, "No, sir!" and suddenly, a burly man with a menacing look pulled out a large cleaver and shouted, "I refuse! Why must we struggle and die for this situation!"

Instantly, the scene was ignited by Kechi's emotional appeal, and the dozens of loyal followers behind him, unable to resist the fervent atmosphere, drew their curved swords and shouted, "I swear to share the fate of my lord!"

The union was located in a region of perpetual ice and snow, especially on the side closest to the ice mountain range, where resources were scarce. The harsh environment had also given rise to this rugged and martial behavior.

The sound of the sword being unsheathed spread like a row of dominoes, and even Zhao Xiu was taken aback. He had anticipated this scenario, but it was too easy to implement, wasn't it?

It seemed that his investment had paid off.

At this moment, Zhao Xiu looked at Kechi, shaking his head and smiling. He was not just targeting Kechi, but the entire town's law enforcement team.

Law enforcement was his area of expertise, and the foundation of the town's administrative power.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

He didn't even think about who to divide with, and it was clear that he would eat alone from start to finish.

Seeing the abnormal smile of Zhongxia, originally, Kaiqi was still satisfied with himself, thinking that his final dramatic gesture would leave a lasting impression on his colleagues. However, he suddenly reacted.

The opponent is on the fifth floor.

Kaiqi had realized that this was not just about his own lineage, but the entire system would be thoroughly cleaned up.

He could show off all he wanted, but it was only for a group of "former law enforcement members" to see.

"Quick——" Kaiqi shouted hastily.

However, before the words "draw the sword" had left his mouth, the person standing behind him, Zhao Xun, had already completed the final action with the "Super Mystic Instant Authority Staff" in his hand.

The four-ring spell "Black Tentacle".

In this instant, Zhao Xun officially revealed his splendor as the leader to the patrol team members and the crowd of spectators who were watching the commotion.

This was also where his pride as a mage lay.

Behind Kaiqi, his loyal followers, who had just been remotely called, could only silently watch as the originally peaceful underground suddenly erupted with countless three-meter-long "Black Tentacles".

Even more terrifying was that these tentacles had an attack ability equivalent to Zhao Xun's spellcasting level, which was a legendary power!

Each strike of these tentacles was like a legendary warrior wielding a sword, and it was impossible to avoid.

Even the strongest warriors or the most agile acrobats were caught by these Black Tentacles and then strangled, presenting a hanging posture.

The area within a 6.5-meter radius was empty, and no one could stand still without being affected.

These arrogant and boastful law enforcement officers who had once been proud and arrogant were all wrapped up by the tentacles, completely immobile.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What? The giant tentacles are playing at the scene, but unfortunately, I can't record it."

"It's still playing along, the town's sky is about to change."

The experienced adventurer who thought he had seen through everything sighed.

"Well, it's not surprising that the police chief didn't come on time, and he got fired instead."

Another player was astonished.

"It's very simple, because he just stepped down from his horse."

"Isn't that unjust?"

"No, he was in this position and blocked the way for the lord, which is his greatest sin."

"Don't worry that he will cause these law enforcement officers to commotion, because you will see enough new faces tomorrow."

"I don't know if this lord can handle it."

A few players who have held management positions looked worried.

Managing a few people, and managing tens of people, is a huge difference, not to mention selecting new people.

In everyone's view, the lord of the summer festival in the town didn't seem to know more than 50 people.

Zhao Xu then instructed Ke Qi, "Go notify the town management, I'm going to call an emergency meeting."

The next moment, a long and distant dragon's roar echoed from the sky, becoming increasingly clear.

"Oh!"

"What's going on?"

"Ah! Fear effect! What's going on?"

Many onlookers who were watching the show bent down, as if they had been struck by a huge impact.

At this moment, a dark shadow slowly descended from the sky, covering everyone.

Suddenly, a dragon with scales as white as snow and a shiny silver sheen appeared, flapping its wings and landing in front of Zhao Xu's empty space.

The airflow blew constantly on the ground, causing some weak people to take a step back.
Here is the translation of the text:

These law enforcement personnel, controlled by the dark tentacles, although their hearts were also invaded by fear, still proudly thought to themselves, "This lord has just struck us, now we'll have to rely on our own magical powers to conquer the dragon's magical resistance."

This speculation was also fermenting in the minds of the onlookers.

However, this massive white dragon, with its majestic body, bowed its head to Zhao Xu and offered its humble submission.

...and returned to his temporary wooden hut, Zhao Xu discovered that Anxi Nina was also in his room, accompanied by an elderly man who stood upright.

The elderly man's physique was emaciated, and his arms were thin and bony, with deep wrinkles on his face, as if bearing the weight of time.

Despite this, the elderly man exuded an aura of grandeur.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but carefully observe the elderly man, who was no longer the Wu Xiaomeng he had known before, and whose memories of their past encounters had become clearer with effort.

He couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "You're the mysterious old man who gave me the 'Automatic Recording Quill'?"

The elderly man smiled, his face creasing into a smile, "I'm delighted to see that you still remember me, Zhong Xiaojie."

Zhao Xu looked at the elderly man, then at Anxi Nina, who remained expressionless, and asked curiously, "Do you know each other?"
"Or who are you?"

The elderly man nodded slightly to Zhao Xu and said, "As the esteemed disciple of the Marquis, I would like to express my respect."

"My name is Elter Matthews," he said.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but open his mouth slightly, "This is the founder of the Elter Kingdom, and also the name."

"Not bad," the elderly man, Elter Matthews, said.
