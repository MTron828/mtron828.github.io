Chapter 146: The Power of a Master Craftsman

When Zhao Xu was transported back to the floating city of Mistralla by Anxin's hand, he still couldn't help but think about the inheritance of the Itterian royal family.

At that time, Zhao Xu also used the "Magical Radiance" spell, covering up the radiant light on his stardust cloak.

If the stardust cloak was not worn, it would appear to be an ordinary cloak, which was more in line with Zhao Xu's requirements.

Therefore, he used the "Magical Radiance" spell to conceal the magical properties of the cloak, making it impossible for others to detect the magical properties using detection magic.

Even if the cloak was worn, the radiant light that resembled the stars would also be concealed, unless someone used a method such as "Identification" to detect it. Otherwise, no one would discover that Zhao Xu was wearing a valuable magical item.

The "Magical Radiance" spell was bound to the caster's level, so Zhao Xu could cast it multiple times, with each cast lasting over 4 days.

After Zhao Xu arrived at the 7th floor of the floating city, Anxin performed the awakening ritual for the enchanted item on him.

The process was similar to the awakening rituals he had experienced before, such as gaining the language of dragons and becoming a "Wisdom Caster".

After the ritual, Anxin received a notice to attend an urgent meeting at the high-level meeting of the floating city, leaving Zhao Xu alone to study the "Enchanted Item" manual.

As the possible lifelong companion of the enchanted item, Zhao Xu carefully read and thought about the details.

After choosing the "Wisdom Caster" ability, Zhao Xu deliberately searched the forum for information on the abilities of enchanted items.
Here is the translation:

He had also carefully read many books about demonic pets, and the most mentioned aspect was that demonic pets and mages were as one. Mages could also derive benefits from their chosen demonic pets, such as a mage who had chosen a toad demonic pet could increase their life value by 3 points, which was even better than the "robust" talent in the early stages. Mages who had chosen lizard demonic pets could increase their climbing skills by 3 points. Of course, many players also liked to choose owls, which would allow them to communicate with the demonic pet. More importantly, as long as the demonic pet was by their side, mages could enjoy the "vigilance" talent, which increased their listening and investigation skills by 2 points. Even if they chose a falcon demonic pet, they could increase their listening skills by 3 points in bright environments, and combined with the vigilance talent, it would be a 5-point increase. At that time, the 1st-level adventurer, forest ranger, and scout had only reached 4th level in investigation and listening skills. Therefore, Zhao Xu was very suspicious that Wang Qingwei and Aiswei had given up on demonic pets, otherwise they would have taken out their demonic pets and continued to increase the effectiveness of their investigation network. In this way, they would have surpassed all players in investigation and listening skills. This was also the scary thing about mages, as they could exceed the skills of 1st-level adventurers who had 8 points of profession skills. After all, 1st-level adventurers relied heavily on skills to survive. However, such powerful abilities were only possessed by mages who had mastered almost all 1st-level spells, like Zhao Xu. Zhao Xu felt a sense of unity with the star-studded cloak on his body after the ritual, and he began to operate the abilities of the itemized demonic pets according to the instructions.
Here is the translation of the text:

The item magical pet is stronger than ordinary magical pets in that it can feedback its own abilities. It's like a mother hen that lays eggs for its owner, not a dragon that swallows gold coins. After reaching level 3, Zhao Xu obtained 4 skill points (3 intelligence and 1 human reward), leaving him with no more profession skill points until he formally obtains a profession level.

He tried to test the skills of the "Stellar Cloak" by injecting 3 skill points from his brain into it. Suddenly, the Stellar Cloak began to react, trying to merge with Zhao Xu's body. After about half an hour, Zhao Xu noticed that his character panel had changed. His remaining skill points had decreased to 1 point. However, an additional line appeared: "Item Magical Pet Skill Point: 4".

Zhao Xu let out a sigh of relief, finally succeeding. Item magical pets are strong in that they can digest skill points and increase them by one-third before feeding them back to the owner. If Zhao Xu dares to invest all his skill points, his skill points will increase by one-third more than those of others under the same conditions. This is a significant improvement in the skill point crisis faced by mages, who have only 2 profession skill points per level. Unlike scholars who have at least 4 profession skill points per level.

The only problem is that these 4 skill points are attached to the cloak. If Zhao Xu is separated from the cloak for too long or the cloak is damaged, he will become extremely passive. However, this is just being passive. Others may lose the skill points invested.
Zhao Xu can make An Ti Nuo Ya perform the Wish Granting Technique to restore his vitality.

This is also the reason why An Ti Nuo Ya arranged the item magical pet for him.

After gaining 4 skill points, Zhao Xu didn't rush to allocate them. His "Hand Skill" skill is a black hole that can absorb as many skill points as he wants. However, he didn't have the time or mindset to practice things like playing with coins or flipping ropes, as he had seen in his past life that a few levels of Hand Skill could allow him to rotate a pair of sharp double-edged blades on his four fingers.

Next, Zhao Xu re-focused on the second ability of the magical pet, "Vitality Return".

Before investing vitality, Zhao Xu had thought about it.

The existence of experience points has been a topic of discussion for a long time. The character panel only quantifies various skill levels, life value, and defense levels, but does not provide an experience bar.

As a result, people have been unable to control when they can level up.

If learning can provide immediate feedback, such as a math problem +1, many people will make an effort to learn. Because learning becomes a tangible thing, just like leveling up in a game.

The magical pet can invest in something similar to experience points, allowing more experience points to be fed back. Although this is beneficial for leveling up quickly, Zhao Xu was unsure how it worked.

However, even small meat is still meat, and Zhao Xu thought about it before starting to meditate according to the manual. He slowly imagined pouring his body's vitality into the cloak.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the corner of the originally quiet room, the three burning incense sticks on the brazier suddenly trembled, accompanied by wisps of smoke.

Zhou Xu's entire body began to emanate a faint glow, as if life force was slowly flowing into his cloak.

Ten minutes later, Zhou Xu woke up with a start.

He noticed that his body seemed to be slightly weakened, and the numbers on the character panel, including his level and HP, began to fluctuate.

"Can't be demoted, can it?" Zhou Xu thought suddenly, recalling his friend who had been kissed by a demon and had lost a level each time as a sweet and bitter price.

Just as Zhou Xu felt like he was on the verge of demotion, a warm flow of energy began to emanate from his cloak, constantly flowing into his body.

It wasn't until half a minute later that Zhou Xu felt he had received a much greater amount of energy than he had paid.

This also confirmed the theory mentioned in the manual, which stated that he, with his "Item Monster" specialty, had gained an additional 10% experience bonus.

If Arthur had a membership, this experience bonus ability could be considered a member benefit.

At this point, Zhou Xu also stood up and brushed off his dusty clothes.

The Item Monster also had the ability to re-invest a spell slot and reduce the backlash by two levels.

Zhou Xu could only give up his 2nd-level spell slot for now, as he didn't have one yet.

As for the remaining abilities of the Item Monster, such as intelligence, communication, and various magical powers, he would have to wait until he leveled up later to unlock them.

Thinking about this, Zhou Xu couldn't help but pull his cloak closer to his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

This cloak can now be considered the most valuable magical item on his body.

After confirming that he has mastered the ability to control magical items, Zhao Xu also logged out of the virtual world and returned to the real world.

...This time, when Zhao Xu logged out again, he found that Zhang Qi was having a video chat with his girlfriend, engaging in their usual daily routine.

Although Zhao Xu had only logged in for over two hours after finishing his meal and received a magical item worth 130,000 gold coins, as well as a powerful skill, he felt like time had passed for a long time.

After suppressing his excitement over the equipment, the legendary story of Ernest began to unfold in his mind.

At that moment, he was in a state of heightened sensitivity and did not ask any further questions about Anny or the person being protected.

However, Zhao Xu was certain that the secrets of Ernest's legend remained unchanged and had not been obtained by any deity.

Zhao Xu had read the book "The Arcane Path" given to him by Anny.

He was clear that the gods of Ernest's era were not the same as the gods of the present day, with an overlap of less than one hand.

Thinking about this, he realized that the gods were also a high-risk profession.

Zhao Xu thought to himself and got out of bed, opening his phone to take a look. In the QQ group, Wang Qingwei and Esveish were chatting with each other, discussing topics ranging from King Arthur's details to daily fashion and 2D topics, which made Zhao Xu feel dizzy.

"Baby, the task of Star Lake is too dangerous, you'd better not go," Zhang Qi said to his girlfriend on the video call.

Then, Zhang Qi began to analyze the environment around Star Lake with his girlfriend.

Star Lake is a crucial location near Winter City.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the University City, people who were born on a winter day in the city of Dawn often go to the surrounding areas of Star Lake to train and fight monsters. It's also where a supply point began to develop.

Listening to Zhang Qi's analysis, Zhao Xu was puzzled. Despite the danger, he couldn't understand why Zhang Qi would give away the remaining four revival stones he had at Star Lake in his previous life.

The Star Lake Battle is the first large-scale battle launched by an Arthurian player, holding great significance.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu's university alliance can have a significant impact in the future.

"Okay, okay, I'll accompany you to participate in the permit." After hearing his girlfriend's coquettish tone on the other side, Zhang Qi quickly consoled her.

Zhao Xu looked at Zhang Qi's back, recalling Zhang Qi's care and help towards his family in his previous life.
