Chapter 193: The Treasure within the Treasure

"Haha," Lark said with a blush, looking embarrassed. "It's just that my official name is the Eternal Holy Artifact."

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked, still confused.

"Well, I can change into different forms of artifacts," Lark explained. "For example, I can transform into the Dragon Pearl, which allows me to control giant dragons and perform corresponding magical abilities."

Zhao Xu listened in a daze, but he had seen many artifacts, so he wasn't surprised. "So, what's your unique ability?"

"I can probably change into a different artifact," Lark replied nonchalantly.

Zhao Xu felt a sense of foreboding, thinking that he would be frustrated to death or alive when he took this little sister on adventures in the future. He took a deep breath and tried to explain in simple terms: "Let me give you an example."

"Oh, no problem, my master," Lark said with a smile. "I can transform into any artifact you want, so I'm also called the 'Treasure within the Treasure.' Even that old goat Gauss praised my abilities."

Zhao Xu felt that the other person was already getting out of line and could only shake his head.

Gauss was the president of the Magic Association who wrote the book "Compendium of Magical Treasures." The book's final page listed the top 50 mainstream artifacts in the current era, using various metaphors and high-level abstractions.

It's said that no one has been able to understand half of that essay to this day, and Zhao Xu is also unsure about the confidence of Lirix.

However, let's change the subject.

Zhao Xu is still listening and has come back to his senses.

It seems a bit excessive.

Is it like he has all the legendary artifacts in the world?

Legendary artifacts are sometimes no stronger than ordinary magical items, but they're impressive.

The strongest destruction spell, "Spellbreaker," can destroy all magical items and cancel all continuous spell effects.

However, when facing legendary artifacts, even this skill has a small chance of success.

"Can you show me the transformation of the 'Great Mage's Staff'?" Zhao Xu urged Lirix to display her value.

"It's possible, but are you sure?" Lirix said suddenly, with a hint of hesitation in her tone.

"Is there a price?"

Zhao Xu suddenly stopped making reckless decisions.

Examples of shape-shifting are endless.

"I can transform into a legendary artifact, but it's unstable. Even if I try to transform into the 'Great Mage's Staff,' the success rate won't exceed 30%. And once I direct the transformation, the duration will be significantly shortened, from a few rotations to a few minutes, and it's hard to predict."

"If I choose to transform randomly into any legendary artifact, I can prolong the duration."

Lirix explained.

Zhao Xu also understood that the more he tries to direct the transformation, the shorter the duration.

He also became curious: "How long can it last if it's random?"

The legendary artifacts provided by directed transformation are only a few minutes, and it's even more awkward when it's a few rotations.

If it's random transformation, it can last for several hours, and it would be very convenient to use, even directly going to the Mistral.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can't be that long. He must be calling me Gou Xia at this point. 'Ah, it should last at least 5 minutes without a precedent.' After thinking for a moment, Lisbeth gave a shocking data that made Zhao Xu's eyes widen.

Zhao Xu nodded, and from then on, he decided not to use the "random transformation" option.

In fact, the difference between 2 minutes and 4 minutes is not significant.

Wait a minute! Suddenly, Zhao Xu started thinking carefully, and his expression changed subtly.

Meanwhile, Lisbeth was floating in mid-air, talking to him as if she was emphasizing the importance of those two minutes, emphasizing that he shouldn't underestimate her endurance for 5 minutes.

However, Zhao Xu's thoughts had already drifted away.

Each god has its own characteristics.

For example, the "Wizard's Rod" and "Script of Ten Thousand Laws" are suitable for gods from the magical system. If they appear in gods like the "God of War" or "God of Courage", it would be out of place.

What kind of god's artifact is the Grim Reaper's? How can it change into other artifacts?

Zhao Xu started recalling his recent behavior.

He must have been led astray by "Yegor's Seven Prophecies" since then. He felt a sense of joy and excitement similar to his previous life, and he never doubted it again.

But from then on, the other party never actually proved anything?

Who knows if it's the devil's rebirth?

At this moment, Zhao Xu couldn't help but analyze the cost of flipping the board.

'Ah, why don't you ask about my true form?' Lisbeth, like a proud little princess, smiled proudly at Zhao Xu."
Here is the translation:

"So, what do you say?" Zhao Xu replied, his face slightly stiff.

"That's cheating me, using your intelligence in places you can't even imagine," Lark said proudly.

At this moment, Zhao Xu lowered his head, trying to conceal his expression, but a smile appeared on the back of his hand.

"Boom! Boom! I've seen your smile!" Lark exclaimed, starting to celebrate with a bouquet of flowers.

Zhao Xu suddenly realized he had thought too much.

However, this is also a helpless place, where the deep cake of the city looks at things and is easy to think too much, without analyzing a few circles, and the heart is not comfortable.

Because of thinking too much and analyzing the probability of going off track is basically high, reaching 90%.

"Just, I'm sure I just brought 'Suppression Outer Skin' just now," Zhao Xu asked back.

He had just used the outer skin three times, successfully reducing the damage from dozens of points to just 9 points.

It felt incredibly real.

"That's definitely true," Zhao Xu said. "This 'Suppression Outer Skin' is the most familiar and stable state I've ever been in. I usually don't do anything without using this state."

At this time, Lark spoke softly, "Your master, are you going to think that you just happened to get this thing by chance?"

"That's not the case. You should just give up on your fantasy," Zhao Xu said. "This thing and the 'Time Reverse Amulet' on your body are both related to the spiritual energy, not a product of the Arthurian world. So, things like this can only be seen by people who have spent a lot of effort bringing them from other multiverse worlds."

"You can speak loudly, there's no one here, and I won't feel embarrassed," Zhao Xu corrected Lark's behavior with a slightly awkward tone.
Here is the translation:

However, he didn't expect that Lirix had already transformed into a "suppressed outer shell" and merged with himself from the beginning.

"You're not the God of Death's artifact?" Zhao Xu shook his head to clear his thoughts.

"My master, how could you think that the God of Death could grasp someone as beautiful as me?" Lirix slipped into a self-absorbed personality.

"Get to the point," Zhao Xu instructed.

At this time, Lirix's voice finally returned to normal and explained, "I'm just borrowing this place and, by the way, supplementing the blood altar's energy to keep it functioning and prevent some short-sighted gods or legendary wizards from discovering my whereabouts."

Zhao Xu thought so too. What place was more peaceful than the God of Death's temple altar?

The God of Death himself was dead, and he couldn't even covet this "Eternal Sacred Artifact".

Meanwhile, the source of the shielding power was not him, and it lowered the risk of being found.

"That means you'll be using the 'suppressed outer shell' to follow me from now on? I'll transform into a god artifact when you need me?" Zhao Xu and Lirix confirmed.

"Yes, no mistake. But I can only transform once a day, and the duration will increase with your level advancement. By the late stages, the transformation can last for up to 10 minutes." Lirix blushed.

"Hey, add a prefix, make it clear who it belongs to," Zhao Xu hurriedly corrected.

At this moment, he also realized that this "Eternal Sacred Artifact" could only make him a "real man" for a few minutes each day.

Moreover, it had to be a one-on-one fight with no outsiders, and the opponent who knew about this prophecy would not survive. Otherwise, if someone who knew about this prediction saw him with this "Eternal Sacred Artifact", they would immediately know what was going on.
Here is the translation:

"Hope you can try your best." At this moment, Larkspur shook her head and sighed, "My previous four masters all died young. Later, I discovered that it was because they treated me like a weapon and didn't have any emotions, so I couldn't unleash my powers. So this time, I deliberately took the form of an 'external shell' to protect my master and cultivate emotions."

Zhao Xu's face darkened almost immediately.

Four short-lived masters.
Is there another time-traveler besides him?

"My first partner was a temporal dragon, but it didn't last long. Later, it was devoured by the river of time. My second partner was a half-divine with the power of time, but it also didn't last long. It died in the war of the gods."

"My third partner was——"

"That's it, I'll try my best to be a growing partner," Zhao Xu said with his teeth clenched.

"However, you have a special treatment this time," Larkspur said with a flattery.

"However, before you can formally master me, you need to do one thing," Larkspur added quickly.

"What?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Just...," Larkspur said awkwardly.

"Just say it," Zhao Xu said, noticing that this artifact had a bit of a talkative personality but was still quite good-natured.

"Just to formally use the artifact, you need to prove yourself, like a ritual. You need to challenge a powerful opponent and succeed."

Larkspur's voice dropped to an inaudible level at this moment.

"What kind of ritual?" Zhao Xu suddenly felt a strong sense of foreboding.

"Similar to the 'Master Level +1' ritual, you need to defeat a powerful opponent to unlock my powers."

Zhao Xu's voice also lowered slightly, "How powerful are we talking about?"

"Yes, based on your current strength, it's not like facing Asmodai. Just go challenge the 'Deep Pit Fiend' that entered my home."

As Larkspur said this, her eyes lit up with excitement. "Goodbye."
