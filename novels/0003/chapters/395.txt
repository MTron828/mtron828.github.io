Chapter 396: The Joy of Plus One

As Viola, a righteous saint warrior, looked at the puzzled expressions of the two men below, she couldn't bear to explain the situation to them. A few sentences later, the warrior North Nation and the Forest Ranger, Jian Yu, gradually turned pale.

They had already realized that they couldn't return to their original escape team.

Thinking about the fact that there were still their bags at the starting point, the two men who were already poor in the game felt a stomachache and couldn't help but curse the adventurers who had died. They looked at the powerful mage in front of them, who could predict that they were the ones who had first plundered the yellow copper treasure box.

This was because the escape team they had joined was absolutely unwilling to venture out again. If they waited for the mage to rescue them, it might not be until the giant mutated scorpion had caught up to them.

Although the two men had not returned to their original team, they had participated in this event and had survived, making themselves guilty of original sin. They would definitely be blamed by the relatives of those who had been killed by the mutated scorpion.

Even their fellow players would complain about them. The few people who had returned to the main camp had been swallowed up by the mutated scorpion and had brought disaster upon themselves, leaving the remaining hatred to be taken by them.

Therefore, the two men directly gave up on returning to the team.

"Are there other similar treasure boxes besides the one you found initially?" Zhao Xu asked.

"There are four or five," North Nation replied.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That place was really terrifying, with corpses hanging from the ceiling, some of which were wrapped in coffins containing dry bones. Even after watching many horror movies, Player Bei would still get the chills thinking about it.

"You find it scary, so why bother staying here to continue searching for a treasure chest?" Zhao Xu laughed and asked.

They didn't block the road with an army of scorpions when they came, which meant that the two of them could have easily found a way to leave. However, they didn't want to leave, naturally wanting to stay and get more treasure.

But the road was still blocked by scorpions, and the two of them were unable to break through.

Even they were worried about the long night, fearing that if they dragged on, they would lose everything. That's why they were hesitant to leave, waiting for the moment to strike.

Only players who had revived stones could afford to be so reckless, wanting money without risking their lives.

"Grand Master, the main reason is that those people moved too fast, grabbing the treasure chest outside first. If I hadn't gotten a treasure chest, I would have been satisfied and left," Warrior Bei explained with a sly smile.

As they spoke, they began to avoid any contact with the dead bodies.

"So, do you two think you can go back and grab the treasure chest?" Zhao Xu asked.

At this point, the two of them looked embarrassed, saying, "We're not as strong as Grand Master, so we can't get it."

They were still staying, ultimately not willing to give up.

It's like being a pearl that's been dropped into the water, watching it float away or sink to the bottom before giving up. Even those small, mutated scorpions could eat them up to the point where nothing was left."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Zhao Xu was about to speak, the warrior suddenly stood up with a humble demeanor and said, "We naturally dare not go back to that nest, but we can escort you, Master, and also provide you with intelligence to prepare for your future actions."

In this game, even players who are not worthy of respect in real life would address NPCs with reverence in order to obtain rewards.

Zhao Xu had just casually raised his hand and flown, and this warrior player naturally wouldn't think that the other was also a player.

So he communicated with the opponent using the way of exchanging information with NPCs.

"Okay, then what do you want?" Zhao Xu asked, almost reaching into his pocket to ask.

There were four or five golden chests in that place, which meant that they had stumbled upon an enormous fortune!

Even though Zhao Xu had over ten magical items on him, he would still feel tempted by the other four or five magical items.

After all, this was a world where one could strike it rich just by digging up treasure.

They were now in a situation where they could reap great rewards with minimal effort.

The warrior listened carefully and then gave Zhao Xu a price quote of several dozen gold coins.

The location was not far away, and Zhao Xu could still find it on his own. If he asked for more, he wouldn't dare.

"Okay," Zhao Xu said, showing no dissatisfaction.

From then on, the warrior gradually introduced Zhao Xu to the intricacies of their journey, especially detailing the distribution of monsters in the nest.

Throughout the journey, Zhao Xu also listened with a furrowed brow.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not too difficult, but rather the monsters in the player's North Country that can intimidate, such as the giant mutated scorpions that are asleep, are within his response range. It seems to take four or five treasure chests, which is a bit excessive.

At this moment, the four of them slowly approached the empty nest in the tunnel. The path was very smooth, with no phenomenon of the mutated scorpions stationed by the North Country.

Zhao Xu suddenly heard some commotion inside, and his face changed color, and he directly took a step back and sprang to the side. In an instant, he flew past.

He saw that the originally quiet nest was filled with countless mutated scorpions frantically fleeing. The nest itself was a giant cave-like structure, with a hard, natural rock wall at the top, with only a few hooks inserted into it, and the suspended corpses had already been removed, unknown whether they were transported away.

The mutated scorpions were continuously drilling into the nest's internal three-to-four-meter-wide dark tunnel, which led to an unknown destination.

Zhao Xu could only be grateful that he arrived early.

Even after these ordinary low-level mutated scorpions realized the disaster of their species after the super-giant mutated scorpions were divided into pieces, they gave up the current nest and fled.

However, the opponent took the treasure chests with them, which was somewhat of a loss.

At the same time, the other two people also struggled to climb over, looking around in bewilderment. These mutated scorpions were even more cunning than them, understanding that the nest had been discovered and fleeing.

At this moment, a giant mutated scorpion was holding a yellow copper treasure box in its pincers, preparing to enter the tunnel. Meanwhile, a ring of medium-sized mutated scorpions were carefully awaiting, layer by layer wrapping it, presenting a protective posture.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although these mutant scorpions have not deciphered what these copper treasure boxes are, it is clear that they regard them as sacred treasures, aside from carrying them individually. In addition to their own defense, they have deliberately strengthened their defense array.

"I'll try flying around and see if I can find a gap to sneak in," Vivian said, watching the scene unfold.

However, Zhao Xu didn't say a word and pulled out the eternal wand from his hand, aiming it at the dark, non-transparent escape hole. With a flash of fireballs, he shot a blast of fire at the hole.

Instantly, the originally clustered mutant scorpions were swept away by the explosive flames that engulfed the escape hole. The fireball magic, which was no less intense than the recently used burning hand technique, mercilessly flooded the cave, slaughtering countless mutant scorpions trying to flee.

Any scorpions below medium size within a 100-meter range of the fireball were basically unable to survive.

In fact, with a damage curve of 5-30 (5D6) for the fireball, only large or above-sized scorpions could barely survive through their own blood reserves.

"This is the power of the three-ring spell?" Warrior Bei Guo exclaimed, witnessing the power of the fireball for the first time up close.

Compared to the burning hand technique, the fireball itself was more intense and dense, covering almost the entire area visible to the eye, with countless dead mutant scorpions unable to breathe.

The abandoned decision by the wizard, which was made earlier, now filled him with regret.

As for the wizard, who had reached level 5, it seemed that he wasn't far off.

"Start moving, prioritize getting the treasure," Zhao Xu shouted, flying towards the treasure.

It was thanks to the opening of the hole just now that he was able to tear it open. Otherwise, he would have been blocked by countless scorpions along the way.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, the only thing that seemed to have lost its vitality was the ground, which looked like it had been scorched by a flamethrower, with a bunch of dead scorpions scattered all over it. 

Outside, the warrior Vivianna began to wield her sacred avenger's longsword, facing the mutated scorpions that were smaller in size. The gigantic mutated scorpion that was holding a yellow copper treasure box in its pincer saw Zhao Xu appear and suddenly swung its other gigantic pincer at him.

At the same time, Zhao Xu was sprinting towards the scene, and when he saw this, he didn't hesitate. He directly held up his black lacquered staff, which was as dark as ink, and struck the mutated scorpion on its head.

"What?" The warriors North Country and the Ranger, who were hiding outside, were about to be stunned.

Just a moment ago, Zhao Xu had fired a fireball spell, and he seemed like a master wizard, but who would have thought that the stick he was holding would suddenly start swinging wildly? 

Arthur's wizardry was not something that a barbarian wizard like Gandalf could do, and it was something that countless players would proudly declare.

However, the subsequent development shattered North Country's illusions.

The staff that Zhao Xu was holding, which was originally just an ordinary stick, seemed to have divine assistance as he swung it, and it directly struck the mutated scorpion on its body.

Moreover, there was no clear sound of the stick bouncing back due to the natural armor. 

All that could be seen was the circle of light on the outside of the stick suddenly bursting open and directly penetrating the mutated scorpion's body, cutting through its natural armor and the outer shell of its body.

The high-grade, extraordinary weapon transformed the stick into a massive, powerful force, while the ghostly strike helped Zhao Xu easily penetrate the opponent's defense.
Here is the translation of the text:

Without fear, the wooden board's ability to withstand attacks sparked a surge of destructive power, instantly transmitting it into the body of the mutated scorpion, instantly tearing apart countless internal organs and leaving them shattered and dismembered.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu swung his staff and ignited a one-ring spell, utilizing the power of the activation symbol on the staff to release a massive amount of magical energy, striking the opponent's body with a crushing blow.

This super-large, mutated scorpion, which had been at the peak of its powers, suddenly discovered that its 75 HP of life force was insufficient to withstand this blow. It was already too late to resist, and its massive body crumpled to the ground.

In its final moments, it noticed the second staff swing coming from behind, but it had already been weakened by the flames and had less than 60 HP left. The second blow was enough to kill it.

The two people at the entrance witnessed this scene, their eyes wide with shock and their faces pale. They even rubbed their eyes in disbelief.

"Just now, that mutated scorpion was almost dead, so it was easily killed by one staff swing," warrior Bei Gu muttered to himself.

"Yes," Lin Jian nodded in agreement.

However, despite their words, they both knew the truth in their hearts.

Fireball spells can still kill small targets, but when facing large targets like mutated scorpions, even if the opponent fails to dodge, it's unlikely to cause half the damage.

For super-large targets like mutated scorpions, the damage is even less, barely reaching a quarter.

Who would have thought that the outcome would be this?

"I've made up my mind," warrior Bei Gu said, his eyes closed in contemplation, as if in a meditative state, "I'll post a message telling everyone that mages can also deal damage in close combat. Tomorrow, I'll cancel my account and create a new mage character."
"I once gave up on being a mage because of this. Today, I've seen the light and will return to being a mage."
In the gaze of the northern region, Zhao Xu is now gently picking up the yellow copper treasure box that has fallen to the ground, not rushing or hesitating to put it into his backpack. Joy is added to the harvest.
