Chapter 301: The Notebook in the Stone Chamber

As soon as they saw the "Prison Soul Demon", a creature that defied everyone's imagination, the members of the guild fell silent.

This creature's appearance was completely different from the skeletons and undead they had seen before, and it looked more like an alien.

If they had encountered this creature in the wilderness, they would have probably treated it as an enemy at first, and it would have taken time to change their perception to consider it an ally.

Especially after Zhao Xu had just used fireballs to wipe out the hundred-odd goblins and then killed the giant demon with a death spell, no one dared to approach the "Prison Soul Demon" to take a closer look.

At this time, Xue Jian received a report from the Kayci squad he had sent to wipe out the remaining goblins and learned that the rear was safe.

He stood in front of Zhao Xu and asked in a low voice, "Crazy Wind, what was the reason behind summoning this undead creature?"

At first, he had only asked Zhao Xu to release a spell like "Web Magic" to temporarily delay the giant demons' movements.

Who knew that Zhao Xu would just wipe out all the giant demons without hesitation, even triggering a dull thud in the forest, killing all the giant demons hiding there.

Therefore, at this moment, his gaze at Zhao Xu was like seeing a lifeline.

Zhao Xu, however, remained calm and composed, looking at Xue Jian and asked, "Do you think things will remain calm from now on?"

Zhao Xu's voice was not loud, but it was loud enough to penetrate to all the players in the scene.

Each person's face became uncertain, and those who reacted quickly turned their gaze to Xue Jian, the guild leader, who was present.

Xue Jian's face also turned dark at this time.
When the three giant demons appeared, he could still convince himself that it was just a misunderstanding. However, when the orc squad appeared, it was clear that they were deliberately working together with the giant demons, which revealed many things.

These guild members are not those who transport valuable goods, nor are they a small group of adventurers like a handful of cats. They are a large team of 40 people, fully equipped with armor, weapons, and even magical gear, with a deterrent effect that makes most wild beasts not dare to attack them.

Moreover, as players, they exist as projections, and if the orcs kill them, they will become non-existent, and their weapons may not even be taken. This shows that they are being watched.

The only thing on Shang Jian's mind that is worth paying attention to is the map of the wizard's tower hidden at the bottom of the lake. This reveals that they obtained the map from the late wizard's heir, which is no longer a secret.

A team of adventurers in their teens can handle this secret, but if a group of level 1-2 adventurers gets their hands on it, it will attract attention.

At this moment, Shang Jian lowered his head, deep in thought. If they can finally find the ruins of the wizard's tower, it will be worth it, even if they have to sacrifice all the revival stones. However, if they have already been closely watched, what they are doing now may be a prelude to someone else's "wedding dress".
Here is the translation:

It's possible that after they enthusiastically leave the Mage Tower with a huge amount of wealth, they will face a strong enemy ambush. If they don't get an equivalent return this time, the union they have worked so hard to build may directly collapse.

"Sister, if not, let's give up," Snowflakes said, her tone already icy cold, but her eyes were worried as she looked at her brother.

At this moment, some other 1-star players who were standing a bit off to the side didn't quite understand what Snowflakes was saying. They had just defeated the attacking team, so why were they giving up now?

On the other hand, the higher-ups in the union were all looking at Frost Sword with a tolerant expression, waiting for his decision.

"No problem, let's give it a try. We can't just turn back without even using a single revival stone," someone said.

"Don't be foolish, listen to the guild leader," another person added.

"Considering the situation, we're facing over a hundred goblins and three giant demons. Who knows what kind of tricks they might have up their sleeves?"

As the poet, who was relatively rational, spoke, he also glanced at the crazy wind mage, implying that he didn't need to say anything else. The wind mage still had many spells left, but the key was whether the other side would let them continue to gamble like this.

Even if the wind mage claimed to be a three-ring mage, no one was taking him seriously anymore. The risk had already exceeded the agreement, and the other side could just leave at any moment.

Frost Sword remained silent, listening to the advice of his comrades, preparing to make a decision.

Zhao Xu watched this scene with a helpless expression.

He had used his lightning-fast methods to slaughter over a hundred goblins and at least six giant demons. Why was Frost Sword being so cautious?

Although most players could play through the game with five revival stones, the majority of them had given up.
Here is the translation:

However, he had already unleashed his "Death Point" and "Death Array" as well as "High-Level Summoning of the Dead" - three powerful killing techniques. Are you still willing to join him and fight alongside him, even after witnessing this?

It's not possible that the opponent would not even bother to use a non-player character (NPC). Although he had heard that Arthur, the current king, had a strong prejudice against players and treated the in-game Arthurians as real people.

Just as Zhao Xu was guessing the motives of the Frost Sword, preparing to add fuel to the fire, the Frost Sword suddenly looked up and said, as if mustering the courage to say, "Mr. Wind, now that you know the risks that lie ahead, are you still willing to venture forth with us?"

The Frost Sword's expression was humble, without any hint of coercion.

Zhao Xu smiled and thought that the Frost Sword had underestimated the value of a wizard tower.

Even in the city of magic, where magic was highly developed, it was difficult to imagine. Even legendary wizards like Anzhi, who had their own independent research facilities in the "Octagonal Tower" of the Floating City, would certainly have their own secret hideouts.

It was obvious that a legendary wizard would not target a straightforward location like the Floating City. However, a "Half-Plane" or a "Wizard Tower" like this was a different story. From the sixth ring onwards, many wizards would start preparing for the construction of a wizard tower. Some would even build multiple towers.

High-level wizards also had the patience to wait for a wizard tower to be completed.

However, Zhao Xu was different. Although he had excavated a wizard tower from the lake bed at a low cost, he had still saved a significant amount of time. Especially since the opponent was a flying wizard tower that took a long time to build.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Mage Tower" is like an unappraised magical item. It can only unleash its true value in the hands of someone who truly understands it. The Frost Sword team cannot do that. Even if they hand it over to the Association, they would only get a few magical equipment items, which is a well-documented fact in the Association's history.

So, they chose to let Zhao Xu, an Association mage, obtain the address of the tower. Although Zhao Xu seems to be unable to grasp the Mage Tower, as an Association insider, he has connections with mentors and family members. Through his channels, he can get a bigger return. Even without going through the Association, Zhao Xu can make key contributions within the Association. Therefore, the high-ranking officials of the Guardian Association are confident that Zhao Xu will give up the majority of the tower's share of benefits.

However, Zhao Xu has the ability to make the Mage Tower return to the sky.

To Zhao Xu, the chip given by the Frost Sword is not just the address of the Mage Tower, but the right to own it. This chip is worth the price he is willing to pay, even if he has to wait until he reaches level 10 to use it. According to Ayn Niyola's words, even without a Mage Tower, one is still a mage. At this moment, Zhao Xu smiled and said to the Frost Sword: "Of course, but I need to take on greater risks later. So, I want to obtain two items from the Mage Tower." The Frost Sword thought Zhao Xu was being reckless, but he was only specifying two items in advance.
Here is the translation of the text:

To know that the wizard's tower is hiding the wizards' lifetime wealth, including precious stones and gold coins used as materials for magic, is their main goal. As for magical items, it's all up to fate.

After discussing the details with Zhao Xu and Shuang Jian, they decided on a plan. They went to take the equipment off the ground dwarves and a few ordinary giant demons, preparing to return to the city to sell them. However, the dwarves were small in stature, and their armor and weapons were not suitable for humans of Zhao Xu's average build. They could only follow the initial agreement made in the guild, which was to return to the city and redistribute the goods.

After experiencing the turmoil, the players of the Guardian's Guild continued to move forward, crossing the Domain of Origin and traversing the treacherous sand dunes.

On the third day, the group finally arrived at a marshland. Zhao Xu was puzzled, as they had deviated from the nearby lake since yesterday. He called out the "Soul Prison Demon" again, which stood quietly at the front of the group, its expression unreadable. "You're not telling me that the wizard's tower is hidden beneath this marshland?" Zhao Xu asked in surprise.

If Shuang Jian had been teasing him all along, he would have to show off the Soul Prison Demon's killing power to make him understand that even a three-ring wizard is not someone to be trifled with.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just as Shang Jian's face broke into a hearty laugh, his chest armor began to vibrate along with it, "Mr. Wild Wind, what we got from that descendant of the mage is essentially a rough map of the location. The map even marks another location."

"There is a mysterious stone chamber hidden in the family's ancestral notes. In the past, the powerful mage who built the mage tower recorded the entire construction process of the tower and the secrets of all the mechanical devices in the tower."

"Only by getting it can we smoothly enter the mage tower. Otherwise, how can we, a group of low-level players, dare to rashly enter the mage tower?"

At this moment, Shang Jian's eyes gleamed with a sharp light, gazing at the dark and murky swamp before him, "The stone chamber where the Eroel's mage notes are hidden is located beneath this swamp."

However, at this moment, Zhao Xu's mind was filled with countless thoughts.

Eroel!
According to legend, seven people brought back the notes from the mysterious tomb, and the third person who returned to Mistral was named Eroel.
Wasn't it that Eroel's family went to the mountains north of Mistral a hundred years ago?

Shang Jian's mind was racing, and he suddenly understood everything in the flash of an instant.

It was the Eroel family's mage who possessed the mage tower, who died in the turmoil a hundred years ago. It was only then that his family left Mistral.

And the notes have been hidden in the stone chamber all along, without being taken out!
