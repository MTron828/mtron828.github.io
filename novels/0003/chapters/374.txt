Chapter 375: Enchanting Saint Warrior

It's as if someone who has a younger sister would naturally dislike the idea of being close to her. Similarly, Zhao Xu, who has a "childhood friend" relationship with Yun Xiaoyu, doesn't have the kind of romantic feelings depicted in cartoons.

Yun Xiaoyu, who can cause trouble and eat, is something Zhao Xu can tolerate, even saying it's not a burden.

When humans from Earth were transported to the other side of the planet during the meteor shower, the sudden pressure of having over 6-7 billion resources, as well as the new environment and everything starting anew, led to a state of great chaos for the first half year.

On one hand, people sought resources to sustain themselves, building makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the harsh environment.

On the other hand, power-hungry individuals vied for dominance, luring in lucky players and seeking to rise to the top.

With various schemes and a harsh environment, even with the help of the gods of Arthur, the number of casualties was considerable.

Most humans on Earth were ordinary people with no special skills or connections, and their occupations were limited.

Even among those who first contacted the Arthur game, not everyone had a smooth ride. For example, Zhao Xu only found out that Xiaoyu was also an Arthur player after they crossed over.

This point also shows that after leaving the small town to attend university, Zhao Xu started to feel a sense of distance with Xiaoyu, with whom he had been familiar with for a long time. Even people who have been close for a long time will become strangers once there is a gap in space and time.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the past, Xiao Wei believed that the bigger the ability, the greater the responsibility. Ultimately, she met her demise in the prime of her life, sacrificing herself to protect civilians, just like many saints who crossed over to the past at the beginning.

As she spoke, Xiao Wei couldn't help but ask Zhao Xu, "Do you also play?"

As she said this, she saw Zhao Xu's expression, which seemed to be both smiling and not smiling, and immediately sat up. "You have to keep my secret," she said. "I use my brain-computer to utilize shallow sleep time to secretly play Arthur, and if you betray me, I'll kill you."

As she spoke, Xiao Wei's expression turned wicked.

"Oh, come on," Zhao Xu replied, pulling out a new pillow from the closet and sitting down. "How many levels have you reached?"

"What do you mean?" Xiao Wei replied. "I've been in the training process for three or four months, but I'm still a novice, and I haven't even reached level one. I'm in a desperate situation."

It was because most people in the community were only level one or two that "How many levels have you reached?" became the default greeting among Arthur players. It was similar to asking "Do you play Arthur?"

"I don't know why," Xiao Wei said, wrinkling her brow. "They say that a mage's training is simpler than that of a wizard or priest, but I'm still stuck on the basic pet."

"Although I can only play for a few hours a day," she continued, "my efficiency is too low, and I can only watch my classmates happily leveling up."

Zhao Xu suddenly realized the difficulties faced by grassroots players. Before, the players he had interacted with, although most of them had relatively low levels, were at least the type of players who invested a lot of time. Playing poorly was one thing, but they couldn't resist the temptation to spend time or even spend money.
Here is the translation of the text:

The largest group in the game is actually the light players who play for three hours a day at most, or one hour at least. After crossing over, they are generally stuck at level one or two in the mud.

If a team of average level 5 players, including Arthur's illegal force, were to join forces, they would definitely notice the change.

Compared to before, Zheng Xin Yu, who has completed half a month of priest training, has a slower speed, but Zhao Xu can already feel the opponent's stable faith energy being transmitted.

If he wasn't weak in terms of spiritual power, he wouldn't be able to provide feedback. Otherwise, he would have already become a priest by now.

According to Zhao Xu's estimation, his opponent might be able to become a priest in another month at most.

In his past life, Zheng Xin Yu had spent three years as a novice priest but was unable to break through to become a priest.

This time, relying on his game player identity, he was able to become a priest in just over a month and a half.

This is the benefit of having a game player identity.

As for the current obstacle posed by his childhood friend, Cloud Xiao Yu, Zhao Xu was also a bit troubled.

If it were a spell model, he could even explain some advanced content to Cloud Xiao Yu on the spot, making it easy to understand.

However, it's a pet.

His pet is still a "material pet" that grants skills and life energy according to level, and it won't awaken new abilities until he reaches level 7.

"I'll go back and check some shortcuts for awakening pets," Zhao Xu said after thinking for a moment.

However, Cloud Xiao Yu looked skeptical.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not like the early days where anything can be shared. Any method that can accelerate one's career is priceless. Even the big V and media accounts that share content are mostly high-end content that ordinary people cannot access. Because it's too high-end, it's not practical and can only be used to satisfy one's curiosity.

However, Yu Qingyue didn't expose Zhao Xu's secret. Perhaps she has known since she grew up that the "Xu Ge Ge" who stood in front of her, shielding her and protecting her and the neighborhood kids, was no longer the all-powerful person she had imagined.

Just like many people's initial ideal shatters when they realize their "father" is ordinary. However, Zhao Xu smiled meaningfully at Yu Qingyue.

...Later that night, Zhao Xu finally regained control of his own room and directly logged back into Arthur. Since Yu Qingyue was in a town far from Winter City, Zhao Xu was unable to physically meet her in the short term.

As he touched the super magical storm, the two people who initially followed him also returned to Mistral. Zhao Xu also left behind his own backup and entrusted Elliot to be his shadow, secretly monitoring Zheng Xin'an and reporting to him at any time.

Zhao Xu realized that he would be disconnected at that moment and realized that he needed Arthur's "native" forces, not just player teammates.

When Zheng Xin'an was about to break through to become a priest, Zhao Xu would naturally return to Mistral and perform a simple review of the past month. Therefore, he didn't worry too much about this.

Only looking back, Zhao Xu gazed at the demon saint warrior Vivian with a puzzled expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this time, Vivian, without the helmet that concealed her appearance, showed her face, which was born from the combination of purity and charm, constantly stirring his heartstrings.

The other party did not have that evil, devilish smell, but instead emitted a fragrance as fresh as milk.

"Your true appearance is what?" Zhao Xu thought that it was impossible to continue like this and decided to let Vivian reveal her true form to make her "awaken".

The easiest way to make someone lose their charm is to know that an idol is also human and needs to eat, drink, and excrete.

It's not that she's a goddess who doesn't eat the food of the world.

Zhao Xu now knows that charm is not equal to beauty or attraction.

However, when he met the demonic pastor in the church, although he thought he was grotesque, his appearance was considered exquisite by the demonic standards.

After all, the demonic pastor had a charm of over 30 points, which was not something to be trifled with.

So Zhao Xu needed the demonic pastor to use her demonic appearance to shock himself, and everything was just like a phantom.

"Mr. Zhongxia, this is my true appearance," Vivian said with sparkling eyes.

"Do you think I'm crazy?" Zhao Xu grinned.

But Vivian just shook her head, and her shoulder-length golden hair brushed against his nose.

"I was created by the mother of evil, Cang Ye, from the beginning, and this is my appearance," Vivian said with a faint smile.

But at this moment, she also revealed a bitter smile.

As a demon born with a human appearance, she would face discrimination in the underworld.

And as for the shape-shifting ability, it was not a difficult task for demons.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the reason why your mentor said you're a container?" Zhao Xu's mind suddenly flashed back to the term mentioned by Andriana.

"No mistake," Vivianna nodded, "I originally existed as a container to confine the goddess."

"Capture the goddess, strip her divine energy, inject her divine nature into my body, use my demise to awaken the goddess's will within me, and this body becomes the prison for the other party, which is the reason why the evil mother created me initially."

Vivianna said, her expression having returned to normal. The conversation seemed to be unrelated to them.

The goddess, of course, wasn't just referring to the magical goddess. Rather, it was one of the many goddesses, with numbers not less than half. No matter how beautiful a human soul was, it couldn't compare to the allure of a goddess's body being stripped of everything.

Zhao Xu didn't even need to think about it, and those benevolent goddesses who had a feud with the devil would be treated with brutal cruelty once they fell into the devil's hands.

At this moment, he couldn't help but feel sorry for Vivianna.

The devils of the abyss, saying that they were absolutely not exaggerating, were born to indulge in desires. And Vivianna, before being converted to the May camp, must have had a similar history. When Vivianna was in her natural form, she didn't have any qualms. Now that she had become a virtuous saint-warrior, she must be extremely disgusted with her past self.

"Sir Zhongxia," Vivianna said, as if she had seen through Zhao Xu's sympathetic expression.

She spoke with a hint of shame, "I am pure."

Pure devil? These two words were probably incompatible from birth. Even combined, they would be the shortest joke.
It seems that the narrator, Zhao Xu, has discovered a mysterious container, Vivianna, who is being kept by the demon lord, Cang Ye. Vivianna explains that she is a vessel and cannot be touched because she is not clean. Cang Ye keeps her close to prevent others from touching her, as she is needed to capture and bind goddesses. Vivianna then insists that she is not dirty.

Zhao Xu is confused and asks Vivianna to clarify. Vivianna does not respond, instead giving Zhao Xu a strange look, as if she can see through him. Zhao Xu realizes that the legendary sorceress, May Fifth, has returned something extraordinary to the world. He learns that May Fifth is the first disciple of Ernest and has been involved in some sort of agreement with Anniya.

Cang Ye's name is also a new discovery for Zhao Xu. He learns that Cang Ye is an ancient demon lord who has been in the Abyss for a long time and is even the ancestor of some Abyss leaders. Therefore, she is known as the Mother of Demons.

It is likely that Vivianna is also part of Cang Ye's plan, but was later destroyed by May Fifth and even sent to protect him. Zhao Xu notices that Vivianna's sword is not ordinary and can sense the cold energy emanating from it, even from a distance.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I hold this sword in my hand.

At this moment, Vivian cancelled her original kneeling posture and directly held the sword hilt, handing it to Zhao Xu.

The crossguard of the hilt was embedded with five red gemstones of varying sizes, shining brightly and captivating the eye. The last one at the tip seemed like a brilliant star in the night sky, radiating a mysterious aura.

"It's the legendary one?" Zhao Xu stroked the straight pattern on the sword's body.

"No mistake, Holy Avenger," Vivian said.

As if in response, the sword began to hum.

Zhao Xu also couldn't help but nod slightly.

It was a sacred artifact worth at least 120,000 gold coins, a treasured item of the Holy Warrior.

However, in the hands of an ordinary person, it was just a normal +2 frost iron longsword.

But in the hands of a Holy Warrior, it would awaken the faith and become a +5 Holy Frost Iron Longsword, granting the Holy Warrior and those nearby a +5 level to their spell resistance.

Moreover, each round, the Holy Warrior could activate the "Higher Dispelling Magic" area spell once.

It could be said that it was the ultimate goal of countless Holy Warriors' dreams.

Zhao Xu lightly returned the sword to Vivian at this moment.

At the same time, he had already noticed that his "Intelligence Headband" had exceeded 24 hours, and finally received this hint:

"Adventurer Zhong Xia, your intelligence has increased by +6 (Intelligence Headband)."

In an instant, his attribute points rose to 28.

At this moment, Zhao Xu finally became the top intelligence player.

Instantly, his spell slot also rose, and the difficulty of his spell resistance also increased by 3 levels.
Here is the translation of the text:

Countless people have obtained attribute enhancements, but it's also the most difficult thing to achieve, and many people can only rely on it, which occurs when they reach level 4.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had obtained such an enhancement, and it was not a small thing. The complex spell model had become clear again.

"Let's go say goodbye to our teacher," Zhao Xu said, and he had already returned to the floating city. However, he knew that he didn't have much time left.

Vivian immediately recovered her role and walked beside Zhao Xu, looking like she was protecting him.

"Did you know my teacher?" Zhao Xu asked curiously.

Vivian nodded.

"Anyone who has experienced the End War knows her," Vivian said. "At the beginning, my master used the downfall of the Magic Empire as a pawn to accumulate a shocking 'secret' before leaving this world."

"It was to exchange a promise with the gods in exchange for his departure from this world, allowing the young lady to safely survive the last End War."

"That was a battle to redivide the gods' powers and determine humanity's fate under the king of Arthus."

"How did the King of Avalon die?"

Zhao Xu suddenly asked this question, which was not recorded in any literature.

At this moment, Vivian's eyes welled up, as if she was crying.

"My master didn't die," she said.

"He just disappeared mysteriously, just like he appeared mysteriously in Arthus."

"Just like he appeared mysteriously."
