Chapter 319: Online Users: 1

Zhao Xu's gaze directly fell on the countdown timer that had already reached zero, and his mind flashed with several possibilities, leaving him uncertain for a moment.

Zhao Xu had indeed enjoyed some extraordinary experiences playing the "Arthur" game, and these were mostly due to his interactions with the characters in the game.

The only thing that exceeded the game's mechanism was his decision to purchase a dual elite account with potential points on the first day, and then using the dual elite's features to continuously roll the snowball.

In reality, dual elite accounts were initially a burden for players.
Because professional training itself wasted a lot of time, and if a player like Zhao Xu chose the dual elite route, it would take at least two months to reach the peak.
The test accounts in the early stages of the game had mostly disappeared by now, and only a few had managed to roll the snowball successfully.

So, was it worth logging in or not?

At this moment, only people like Zhao Xu who knew the inner workings of Arthur would be so troubled.
Because he was connected to a real-world energy transmission channel.
After two days of careful examination of the mysterious silver panel, Zhao Xu had even guessed the truth that best fit the facts without any supporting evidence.

In that mysterious research institute, the high-level researchers of the Mage Association had activated the material transmission channel when they were activating the energy channel, which directly caused the energy channels of all players who had projected their energy to the earth to be interrupted.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

But it's likely that 80% of the factors are due to Zhao Xu standing too close, plus he has sufficient magical abilities and equipment, and his mana is beyond limits.

Even Zhao Xu suspects that it might be due to the Lich attached to him, or the fragments of the divine power.

Because these two are outside the predictions of the Mage Association.

In just a few seconds, Zhao Xu analyzed seven or eight possible scenarios he might encounter, but still decided to click the login button.

As soon as he clicked the button, Zhao Xu suddenly felt a strong vibration in the brain scan helmet.

His pupils flashed with a rainbow-colored glow, as if he had fallen into a pool of rainbow-colored starlight. The strong color visual impact covered his field of vision.

This strong stimulation immediately swept away his entire consciousness, causing him to fall asleep instantly.

At the same time, Zhao Xu didn't notice that in the upper layer of the identity information input interface, there was a row of current online player numbers below.

As Zhao Xu logged in, the "0" in the bottom row suddenly jumped to "1".

At this moment, many players who had logged in at the same time saw that some directly entered the immersive movie mode to watch movies, while a few stubborn ones directly re-entered the game interface and saw the non-zero game online numbers, feeling delighted.

Many players felt uncomfortable because they hadn't played for a day and had gotten out of practice.

On the forum, many warriors complained that their combat skills had become rusty.

However, when these brave players entered the formal login interface, they found that the countdown timer was cold and showed 09:51:23.
Here is the translation of the text:

Players who discovered this point generally think it's just a machine glitch and quickly try to log in to their game to find friends to play with. Some even post on the forum to notify other players to verify. Many players on the forum initially thought it was a boring prank, but the scene unfolded over the past two days, causing many to be fooled, and the moderator banned a batch of suspicious accounts.

However, when they saw the screenshot of the login interface showing "Current online players: 1", some people still felt uneasy and decided to log in again. Then they encountered the same situation.

The forum suddenly confirmed the authenticity of the screenshot, and the focus shifted from suspecting PS to server display failure, and of course, some people also whispered about conspiracy theories. In the last 10 hours before the official launch, this caused a significant stir.

Many good players were guessing who the true "1" was. However, Zhao Xuyu suddenly regained his consciousness and found himself still in the mysterious research room where he disappeared.

The researchers and equipment in the room were still there, but there were fewer observers on the second-floor corridor. Compared to his memories two days ago, Zhao Xuyu found that about 7-8 people were missing. However, he noticed that everyone's robe style and color had changed slightly, which made him wonder if he had only been disconnected for a moment, not over 24 hours.

This realization made him think of a terrifying possibility - that the two worlds were out of sync. At this moment, Zhao Xuyu noticed that Anni still stood in the same position as before, and she also noticed his appearance.
Here is the translation:

Or, one could say that all the researchers in the room, including the sorcerers on the second floor, all turned their attention to Zhao Xu, who had suddenly reappeared after disappearing earlier.

But no one seemed to know why, and no one came forward to ask any questions.

At this point, Zhao Xu was probably the most critical person involved in the unexpected occurrence.

After a brief moment of attention, the researchers below began to busy themselves again, working on the devices in the corridor.

"Have you come back?" This time, Anzhiya's voice, linked to the heart, echoed in Zhao Xu's mind.

"Did you guess I would come back?" Zhao Xu asked immediately.

It was impossible for these people to have coincidentally stayed in this research facility for two consecutive days.

Zhao Xu guessed that something unusual had occurred, causing seven or eight observers to gather again.

Especially at this time, it was Arthur's midnight, and everyone should have gone to sleep by now.

For the sorcerers who needed to rest to recover their exhausted magical energy, it was even more important to follow the principle of early sleep and early rise.

After hearing Zhao Xu's question, Anzhiya smiled and replied, "About two hours ago, they notified us that the energy channel had temporarily restored a small part. So we came to take a look at the situation."

Then, Anzhiya began to explain to Zhao Xu the reason why he had suddenly disappeared two days ago.

In general, it was roughly consistent with Zhao Xu's guess.

The only difference was that Anzhiya explained it more from the principle of magic, and also let Zhao Xu understand that the sudden disconnection was due to the "Time Reversal Amulet" on his body.

The "Time Reversal Amulet" itself referred to a "Heart Spiritual Ability" with nine rings, not Arthur's magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur's world does not exist, and all the mental powers, including the "suppression skin" on Zhao Xu's back, are products of other universes with mental powers. Naturally, Zhao Xu, wearing these two mental powers, unknowingly allowed the energy channel to absorb the power from other universes, causing his stability to collapse.

Originally, this material-energy transmission channel was a measure to prevent mental powers, but it was unexpected that Zhao Xu was wearing two mental powers, one of which was particularly strong, causing this leakage. However, this loophole has been patched up, and even if you're now a mental master, you can still withstand it.

You are able to enter Arthur's world ahead of schedule because of the special optimization for you to repair this loophole. The channel is currently in a semi-damaged state and will only be fully opened at 10 am tomorrow. As you have been optimized, you've entered ahead of schedule.

Normally, this transmission channel has self-protective mechanisms, such as when a player's emotions surge or special methods are used, the channel will automatically disconnect the player's connection. However, Zhao Xu has obtained greater permissions, allowing him to be more "arbitrary".

This arbitrariness is equivalent to leaving a back door for Zhao Xu to use this channel in the future.

"If you want to mess around, you have to tell me first," said An Ti Noya, looking at Zhao Xu's gaze fixed on the eight silver panels, knowing his thoughts.

"Because you yourself are reckless, you may not be able to return permanently." An Ti Noya said with a double entendre.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu immediately understood the opponent's intention.

In other words, in the game, he was relying on this channel to bring back his strength and appear on Earth as a three-ring wizard.

At that time, he could use those three-ring spells, especially the suggestion spell, hypnotizing humans, shape-shifting, and mental detection, without any restrictions on Earth.

However, he would not be able to return to Arthur's land through normal means.

This was because the original him was still sleeping on the dormitory bed on Earth, while his soul had taken on the form of a three-ring wizard and appeared on Earth.

This was similar to the legendary "Star Projection" spell that allowed the wizard to possess a duplicate and go on an adventure.

However, unlike the "Star Projection" spell, which allowed the wizard to dispel the duplicate at will, Zhao Xu had to bring the duplicate back through the channel. Otherwise, his soul could not return to the creation temple.

"What are they studying down there?" Zhao Xu continued to ask.

"Researching why the channel automatically rebooted just an hour and a half ago," Anzhi Noya replied carelessly. "It's as if there was a mysterious energy resonance between the two realms, which directly caused the channel to form a half-connection. The original channel had already begun the formal reboot, waiting for tomorrow at 10 am."

"So, let's go take a look at what kind of power is affecting it."

Two hours had passed.

It was also two hours ago when the channel exhibited this phenomenon, which made Anzhi Noya and others rush back to investigate.

However, Zhao Xu had a sense of this time.

It was at the moment when Zheng Xinian was reciting the prayer and causing his internal spiritual energy to vibrate.
