Chapter 556: Barren Death Ground, Mysterious Man

The Barren Death Ground is located at the coastal outlet of the entire North Region.

Although this area occupies the coastline, the energy level of the entire forbidden area exceeds the general standard, and the corpses buried underground will unconsciously transform into undead beings.

As a result, this land has become a "barren region" and is no longer inhabited by humans. Even the bravest adventurers dare not set foot here.

This vast region in the North Region has gradually become a desolate and uninhabited area, and only the most powerful adventurers dare to set foot here.

However, there are not a few adventurers who have entered and returned, only to transform into undead beings.

As the morning sun shines down, a man lying on the ground slowly opens his eyes, blinks, and slowly regains consciousness.

"What's happening? Should it be a dream?"

Just as this public servant, who had just joined society, opened his eyes, he was shocked to find that the surrounding forest was unlike anything on Earth.

It's more like the game he played a month ago, "Arthur".

"Damn it, I must have been daydreaming, and I've been nostalgic for that game."

The man rubbed his eyes again.

But the next moment, he realized that the half-armor he was wearing was incredibly real, with a tactile sensation that was completely consistent with his memories. The only thing that didn't quite fit was the heavy feeling, which made him hesitate.

"Could I have really crossed over?" the man was skeptical, unable to resist touching his face as if he were trying to get a sense of reality from it.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not just you, it's everyone." Suddenly, a voice from behind made the man jump, and he quickly turned around to see a patroller wearing a chainmail shirt, with vines wrapped around their armor, indicating that they had been to the battlefield many times.

"What does it mean?" the warrior asked, unable to help himself.

"You'll see," the patroller said, pointing to the location behind him.

On the muddy ground behind, hundreds of people were lying down, most of them in a coma, with only a few like the patroller who had woken up.

"This means everything is true?" the man muttered to himself. "I thought it was just a dream..."

"Stop being so careless," the patroller warned. "This forest is not right. I'm afraid these people will fall asleep and not wake up again."

"What's next?"

"They'll all become zombies and skeletons."

...In the end, players were scattered throughout the vast wasteland.

Originally, the number of players was unimaginably large, compared to the tens of billions of people on Earth, it was like a drop in the ocean.

If it weren't for the existence of the enemy team's unbeatable strategy, even the tide of players would be enough to overwhelm our side.

"Quick, block it!" a girl suddenly cried out.

In front of her was a zombie, waving its arms and slowly approaching the girl.

The other one was also a person who had crossed over from Earth, but had been corrupted by negative energy just a few hours after falling asleep and died in their sleep.

The corpse was then transformed into a zombie with shriveled skin, a sunken face, and an evil stench, and within a few moments, it had disappeared into thin air.

"Come on!" the girl's friend shouted at the men who were standing there, looking at each other but doing nothing.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's take a look at the situation," a muscular man said with a hint of explanation. "Who knows what's causing this? If we touch them, they'll turn into zombies, what are we going to do?"

Behind the crowd, there were hundreds of other survivors. The scene of zombies spreading through touch from horror movies had a profound impact on people's judgments.

"You're nothing but men," the woman's friend cried, tears streaming down her face.

As people worried about the woman, who seemed on the verge of losing her life, yet couldn't help but feel helpless. Suddenly, a long sword appeared, and in an instant, it took out the zombie with one swift strike.

The woman, wearing half-armor, put away her sword and said to the crowd, "Don't panic, we'll reorganize and establish order. These zombies are not contagious, as long as we work together to surround and kill them. First, let's wake up the unconscious ones."

Similar scenes were repeatedly unfolding in the devastated wasteland.

The first crisis was the people who didn't wake up in time, who slowly turned into zombies in their sleep, even to the point of becoming skeletons. This was the terror of this desolate land, unable to be buried.

As for areas with police and soldiers, although they may not be as strong as the players, after overcoming the fear of infection, they could still handle a few stray zombies.

At this moment, the monsters in this desolate wasteland were also eyeing these unexpected visitors.

As people slowly adjusted to their new surroundings and realized that the world they had crossed over was not the peaceful world they had imagined, the masses began to organize into small teams for self-protection.

In this apocalyptic atmosphere, many of the earth's upper-class individuals slowly became aware that their greatest reliance on "production resources" had been lost.
Unless one is a professional with specialized technical skills, there is no longer a name to be proud of. As giant and ferocious animals begin to appear, these "Arthurs" who have previously played the game will suddenly emerge from the crowd.

"Everyone, please line up and register your identities," a player at the front of the line shouted, just having effortlessly killed a tiger that had bitten two people to death and made a lasting impression on everyone's minds.

Otherwise, a tiger would soon become a corpse on the ground.

"Alright, leader," a wild man player said to his superior, who was a middle-aged man with a dignified demeanor.

The middle-aged man nodded in satisfaction, saying, "Well done, Xiao Qi. We'll remember your contributions when we get back."

"You'd better quickly contact your former teammates and summon them in the name of the organization. We're in an emergency situation, and only if everyone works together can we find a way out," the middle-aged man said firmly.

However, his heart was also filled with gratitude that this young man, whom he had previously looked down upon, was now a player in this game and could rely on his "influence" to control the situation.

Even with Xiao Qi's identity as the team leader in the game, his subordinates had already gathered and followed his arrangements.

"Hey, don't bother our elder brother, he just finished filming yesterday and is very tired," someone suddenly shouted from the crowd.

As the commotion spread, several people quickly ran over.

"What's going on?" Xiao Qi, the wild man, asked.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Suddenly, a slightly short woman stood behind a tall and handsome man, recounting the events that had just occurred, while another three or four companions stood by her side.

The woman and her companions directly encircled the man, keeping him tightly guarded, while the handsome man remained silent.

Originally, Xiao Qi, who was under pressure, seemed to recall unbearable memories and suddenly let out a loud shout: "Line up according to discipline!"

"I don't care who you were or what kind of celebrity or businessman you were," he said. "But I want to tell you one thing: you're now in Arthur, where everything depends on your own two hands to survive. Don't think about relying on your past glories to live a peaceful life here."

"So, please put away your airs, and if you disobey the rules, I'll have no choice but to ask you to leave and withdraw my protection from you."

The girl who had just spoken, originally wanting to argue, but thought of the terrifying appearance of the old tiger that had just fluttered over, and her courage, which had just been boosted, was suddenly extinguished.

She lowered her head and replied, "Yes, we will comply."

The middle-aged leader standing behind Xiao Qi also changed his expression when he heard these words, but thanks to his many years of cultivation, he was still able to maintain a smile.

It was no wonder that Xiao Qi suddenly exploded, because from this moment on, he had discovered that his physique was no longer the weak and feeble scholar he used to be, but a true strong and mighty warrior.

However, players are not biological organisms that can be isolated from society, regardless of how solitary they may be. They all have their own family members, and family members also have the most direct impact on the relationships between players.
Here is the translation:

The family members who had never met Arthur before were initially convinced that the original organization was the right one, rather than the player who had already taken the lead, and naturally, they also advised players to obey the organization's deployment without any combat ability.

As expected, in the initial hours, the entire chaotic wasteland formed a new management team, temporarily composed of players and the original earth management team.

Even these original management teams didn't hesitate to take positions, directly giving away the positions that countless people over several generations could not have reached, which temporarily stabilized the power.

Soon, these groups began to contact nearby groups, and these earth-crossers slowly discovered something.

All earthlings had crossed over to the same area.

The players also realized that this region was much larger than they had initially thought.

"Line up, we're going to take a headcount. Don't run wild, there's danger nearby, and no one can protect you." A middle-aged woman with a sharp face shouted, having dealt with the masses at the grassroots level, and naturally knew how to intimidate this group.

Below her was a sea of people, packed onto this empty land, which made it easier for outer-layer players to patrol.

"What should we do about Xiao Xu?" a middle-aged woman sighed, blaming her husband beside her.

"It's all your fault, Xiao Xu, he agreed to go travel with us at the beginning," she said, scolding her husband.

"When he said he wanted to confirm something, his determined expression was the first time I've seen him like that in my lifetime," the woman's husband also sighed, "You know Xiao Xu has never asked us for anything, he's always been very considerate. Before the exam, he begged me, how could I refuse?"

Here is the translation of the text:

"The woman shook her head and said, 'You look at that, everything in this area is based on the Earth's coordinates, and I have no idea how Little X is doing over there, whether he's hungry or not.' The middle-aged woman looked worried.

"Don't worry too much," her husband said softly, gently squeezing her shoulder. "You didn't notice that in this local situation, young laborers are in high demand. Once you have the opportunity to join them, it's actually a good thing."

The middle-aged woman suddenly had a reaction, "Oh, I remember that Little X posted a message on the family group about a month ago, saying we should enter this game."

Just then, the man's expression turned sour, "Don't you remember eight months ago when we also entered the game? Don't you think your physical condition is different now?"

"It's a pity that Zhao X doesn't like playing games, and he missed this opportunity to become one of the elite."

As he spoke, he gazed back at the past, the few elderly people who were weak in body had been invaded by the negative energy from the ground, their faces pale, as if they were about to collapse at any moment.

Suddenly, the middle-aged woman excitedly grabbed her husband's sleeve.

"What's wrong?" the man didn't react.

"What is it? What is it?"

"Hold on! Who is it?"

At this moment, a stern-looking woman who was counting the personnel shouted, but soon realized that the man in front of her was wearing a cloak that sparkled with starlight.

The opponent was a player!

The mysterious man quietly walked past the opponent and walked to the side of the middle-aged couple, "Mom, Dad, come with me, I'll arrange for you to go to a safe place."

The man's voice was not loud, but it seemed to carry a sense of gravity.

As soon as the mysterious man appeared, the staff in charge of this area rushed over, and two other players were also seen following behind them."
Here is the translation:

"This mage, sir, we are now mobilizing you under the emergency regulations, according to the instructions, to temporarily join the Arthurian Player Guard, and we hope you will comply with the arrangement and strive for the survival of humanity."

The man who had been running up quickly stood in front of the mysterious man, gasping for breath.

"Move aside," the mysterious man said with a voice as sharp as a sword, as if his intentions were to kill.
