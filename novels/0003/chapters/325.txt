Chapter 326 The Fallen

"Sir, how about I go ask the neighbors around first?" Eliton saw Zhao Xu frown and quickly gave his suggestion, "Because there are too many fallen leaves on the garden path, it seems like no one has been here for a while, maybe they went on a trip."

"No," Zhao Xu shook his head, "Approaching a breakthrough in promotion, even irresponsible parents wouldn't let their children go on a trip."

Unless they have been unable to make a breakthrough for many years, they would choose to go out and try their luck.

Otherwise, most people would stay obediently in a place where they can seek timely advice and help, which is the most secure way to make a breakthrough.

In fact, even players like Zhao Xu and his group, as long as they successfully advance to level 1 mage, it's worth celebrating on the forum and receiving congratulations and envious looks from mage apprentices.

This behavior has not gone out of style in the two to three months after the server opened.

And for Arthur to become a mage, it's even more difficult.

Even in mage families with many talents, after their descendants become mages, they would specially hold banquets to entertain relatives and friends.

The emphasis on mages is also one of the reasons why Mysteria can become the most developed place in magical civilization.

Eliton looked at Zhao Xu assessing the height of Peter's iron gate, thinking that he wanted to climb over it, and quickly said, "Sir, if you want to climb over, let me do it, your identity is not suitable."

As he spoke, he also looked around the streets and alleys to see if there were any patrolling guards.

"What are you thinking," Zhao Xu assessed Eliton, this kid wouldn't be getting addicted to taking the blame, would he.
Zhao Xushun quickly glanced at the spell slots on his body, and they were still mostly intact. The fourth ring of the mage is also the third ring of the poet's divination, which allows him to directly perceive Peter's situation under certain intelligence. However, Zhao Xushun is not at level 6 yet, so he cannot release the third ring divine spell, and naturally cannot cast the poet's spell in the divine spell version. As a second choice, he can choose to secretly check if there is anyone in the room. The "Hawkeye" of the third ring can help him with this. The "Hawkeye" and "Sharp Ear" are among the best in the third ring divination spells, not just spells that enhance his vision or hearing on paper. Instead, they can directly set up a magic sensing field at a specific location within a radius of about 200 meters based on his casting level, even if he cannot see that place, as long as he knows the specific coordinates or information about that place. If the spire does not block divination spells, Zhao Xushun can use this spell to peep into Antinoya's office without entering the tower. Therefore, blocking divination spells has become a standard feature of some secretive places, and many mage associations have similar rooms for confidential conversations. Of course, Zhao Xushun cannot use the "Hawkeye" spell directly to spy on his student Peter's situation. If he didn't suspect anything, he should have turned around and left, waiting for the next visit. After some thought, Zhao Xushun decided to go for the second best. He rolled up his sleeves and used the "Versatile Spellcaster" professional ability directly.

In fact, after Zhao Xu obtained the "Death God's divine fragment," he already understood that the legendary death spirit wand in his hand had become somewhat different. Like the original six-ring spell "Advanced Summon Undead," which originally only created advanced undead creatures, he still had to go through a command process, and the spell itself could only be released at night. But that day, on that strange death spirit wand, none of these became a problem. This also made Zhao Xu somewhat suspicious whether the divine fragment of the death god in his hand would just happen to combine with this death spirit wand and evolve into a divine weapon. Ultimately becoming Zhao Xu's first true divine weapon, rather than being in a state of malfunction like Luxe recently, unable to respond to his summons. "Ban Dao, then I'll go find the patrolman," Elidon said nervously. Mysteria's "Spell Guardian" is essentially used to deal with the same kind of mages, and most disputes involving ordinary people are resolved by the police department. But Zhao Xu shook his head, "Calling them will probably just be sending them to their deaths, and it will be too late by the time they arrive." As if that mysterious breathing had sensed him, and then miraculously stopped, the breathing disappeared. Only the sound of water droplets was still quietly flowing, falling to the ground and creating echoes. Zhao Xu silently pinned on a "Senior Inspector" badge of the "Rose Cross." With this heavy identity, even if he forcibly intruded into a mage family, he would not be pursued, let alone just an ordinary residence. "Can you pick locks?" Zhao Xu asked tentatively. Elidon immediately shook his head. But when he saw Zhao Xu turn his head back, thinking that the other party was disappointed in him, he quickly said, "Sir, I will go back and learn this skill."

The strong pungent smell immediately wafted over, causing Eliot behind Zhao Xu to turn extremely pale, as if recalling the unforgettable nightmare he had experienced more than ten years ago.

But he could only grit his teeth and clamp down on his thigh with all his might when he encountered this scene. He knew that at this moment, Zhao Xu's test of him was also underway. Because he had voluntarily given up the option of choosing other ways of assessment.

He could only restrain himself, widen his eyes, and look at the still cruel world in front of him.

Above the luxurious chandeliers in the hall, there were also several bodies hanging, which were already difficult to distinguish, swaying slowly even without wind.

The dripping sound that Zhao Xu heard was the sound of their dripping blood.

And standing on the bloodstains that had gathered from the dripping, there was a man, or rather a male creature.

Black scales had already grown on his exposed skin, and even most of his face was covered with them. Only a few of the scales on his neck had fallen off, revealing the rotten flesh inside, which was red and disgusting.

The man's eyes glowed red, and he looked at Zhao Xu and Eliot with extremely fierce killing intent, with a pair of bat-like wings constantly opening and closing behind him, as black as if they had been charred.

"P-Peter, how did he become like a demon?" Eliot exclaimed, covering his mouth at this moment, already noticing the horns sprouting from Peter's head.

"This is a semi-hell creature," Zhao Xu said indifferently, "A good person doesn't have to take this kind of detour."

With that, Zhao Xu lightly snapped his fingers, dispelling his own illusion.

Instantly, the cashmere coat he was originally wearing disappeared without a trace.

In its place was a cloak with a sparkling starlight trail, constantly shimmering and shining, draped over his shoulders and fluttering in the wind.

Peter, who had already become a semi-hell creature, also roared and charged towards Zhao Xu at this moment.
