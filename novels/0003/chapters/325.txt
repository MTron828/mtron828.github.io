Chapter 326: The Fallen

"Sir, shall I go ask the neighbors around here?" Elton saw Zhao Xu wrinkle his brow, and quickly offered his advice, "Because there are too many fallen leaves on the garden path, it seems like no one has been here for a while, maybe they're away on a trip."

"Not," Zhao Xu shook his head, "parents who are responsible and nearby will not let their children go out of town."

Unless it's been a long time since they've broken through, they will choose to go out and take their chances.

Otherwise, most people will stay in a place where they can get timely guidance and seek help, and it's the most stable way to break through.

In reality, even Zhao Xu and his group of players, once they successfully level up to become level 1 mages, they are worthy of posting on the forum to celebrate, and receiving congratulations and envious looks from fellow apprentices.

In the two to three months after the server opened, this behavior has not gone out of style.

And Arthur people becoming mages will be even more difficult.

Even talented mage families will set up banquets to entertain their friends and family when one of their own becomes a mage.

The importance of mages is also one of the reasons why Mistral this region has become the most advanced magical civilization.

Elton looked at Zhao Xu, who was sizing up the height of Peter's iron gate, thinking he was about to climb over, and quickly said, "Sir, if you want to climb over, it's better if I do it. Your identity is not suitable."

As he spoke, he also looked around the streets and alleys, checking if there were any patrolling guards.

"What are you thinking?" Zhao Xu looked at Elton, wondering if this kid was trying to take the blame or something.
Zhao Xu instantly swept his gaze over his body, and most of his magical arrays were still intact.

As a four-ring mage and also a three-ring poet, he could use his "Perception" spell to directly sense Peter's condition if he had some information beforehand.

However, Zhao Xu had not yet reached the level of a six-ring mage, so he could not cast the three-ring divine spell. Therefore, he could not use the poem spell, which was a version of the divine spell.

Instead, he could choose to secretly observe the room to see if there was anyone inside.

The "Eagle Eye" spell, which was one of the top three-ring prophetic (perception) spells, could help him do this.

The "Eagle Eye" and "Sharp Ear" spells were not just paper-thin enhancements of his visual or auditory abilities, but could directly set up a magical sensing area within a range of about 200 meters from his current location, allowing him to sense the situation at a specific location.

He didn't even need to see the location; as long as he had a clear mental image of the coordinates or knew the location, it would work.

If the pinnacle tower didn't block the perception spell, Zhao Xu wouldn't need to enter the tower to use this spell to secretly observe Anny's office situation.

Therefore, the blocking perception method had become a standard feature in many secret places, such as the rooms provided by many mage associations for confidential talks.

Of course, Zhao Xu couldn't directly use the "Eagle Eye" spell to spy on his student Peter.

Even if he wasn't sure if there was anything suspicious, he should have turned around and left, waiting for the next visit.

After thinking it over, Zhao Xu still decided to settle for second best.

He quickly rolled up his sleeves, took out his hand, and directly used his "Multi-Talented Mage" professional skill.

As soon as Zhao Xu's two ring-shaped magical positions merged in his hand, they transformed into a three-ring "Sharp Ear Technique", which also saved him from the 10-minute casting time. Zhao Xu, who had been careless, decided that as long as he couldn't hear the sound of breathing from the people in the room, he would leave immediately.

Eilton noticed that Zhao Xu was casting a spell and quietly stood beside him, ready to defend against any unusual phenomena. As Zhao Xu finished his incantation, a formless magical energy burst into the room, ignoring any obstacles.

Next, a formless magical sensing field was set up at the location chosen by Zhao Xu, beginning to collect sound information from the room.

Eilton noticed that Zhao Xu's face had become somewhat strange and whispered, "Master Zhongxia, what's wrong?"

"It's strange," Zhao Xu felt a sense of astonishment. "It's the sound of dripping water."

"Is there also the sound of heavy breathing?" Eilton asked.

"There isn't any yelling sound," Zhao Xu replied.

Zhao Xu's face became even more unnatural. Meanwhile, Eilton was also looking at Zhao Xu with a strange expression.

Zhao Xu, however, was too busy to pay attention and urgently called out for his "Spirit Demons" to come over.

"Spirit Demons" are evil, immortal beings that will be instantly killed by the guards of the Mystical Realm if they dare to appear openly. However, Spirit Demons are normally lurking in the "Spirit Realm" or "Stellar Realm", tracking travelers and waiting for the right moment to strike.

Therefore, Spirit Demons are usually dormant, but when Zhao Xu gives an order, they will come from other Spirit Realms or Stellar Realms, which intersect with the main material plane, and then appear in the main material plane.

In reality, after Zhao Xu obtained the "Soul God Fragment", he had already realized that the legendary soul-stirring staff in his hand had become slightly different.

The original six-ring spell "Higher Summoning of the Undead" was only meant to create high-level undead creatures, and it required a complex process to activate it, and the spell itself could only be released at night. However, that day, with the unusual soul-stirring staff in his hand, these constraints no longer applied.

This also made Zhao Xu somewhat suspicious, wondering if the Soul God Fragment he held might just combine with the soul-stirring staff to evolve into a true divine artifact.

Eventually, it would become Zhao Xu's true first divine artifact, unlike Lark's recent state of being unable to respond to his summons.

"Should I go find the patrol to report this?" Elliot said anxiously.

Mistral's "Magical Guardian" was originally designed to counter similar magicians, while ordinary disputes were usually resolved by the law enforcement department.

However, Zhao Xu just shook his head, saying, "Calling them would be a waste of time, and it's too late anyway."

As if the mysterious breathing sound had sensed him, it suddenly stopped breathing and disappeared.

Only the sound of dripping water continued to flow quietly, echoing to the ground.

Zhao Xu silently pinned on a "Knight's Badge" with the "High-Level Inspector" insignia.

With this authority, he could even storm the magician's family without being pursued, not to mention a ordinary civilian residence.

"Can I open it?" Zhao Xu asked tentatively.

Elliot shook his head immediately.

However, after Zhao Xu turned his head back, Elliot thought the other party was disappointed in him and hurriedly said, "Sir, I'll learn this skill later."
Here is the translation of the text:

"No need, our mage can use a spell to open it," said Zhao Xuguang. As soon as he finished speaking, the incantation that had been memorized in his mind suddenly came out of his mouth.

He waved his staff in his hand, lightly striking the iron gate lock that was stuck.

The gate suddenly shook, and the lock head, as if manipulated by an invisible hand, turned and opened. The lock's pin also automatically returned to its original position. In this way, the iron gate that could only be broken open with brute force was opened by Zhao Xuguang using the "Impact" spell.

Elliott, who had been watching this scene, lowered his head.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xuguang asked.

"There's nothing, I just remembered when I was a child, my toy box was locked, and someone used a similar spell to open it for me," Elliott said weakly, his fists clenched tightly.

Zhao Xuguang heard this and let out a gentle sigh.

"The things ahead may bring back bad memories, so why don't you just stay behind?"

"No, sir, I'd like to follow you," Elliott said, but he still had a sense of determination.

"Then let's go," Zhao Xuguang said, and he had already walked through the garden in front and arrived at the red wooden door of the mansion. The intricate woodcarvings on the door could still be seen.

Zhao Xuguang continued to use his staff to open the door in front of him, accompanied by the third "ah" sound he had heard today.

However, what entered his field of vision was a sea of bright red, as if they had mistakenly entered a battlefield where blood was flowing freely.
Here's the translation of the text:

As the pungent stench suddenly enveloped him, Elton's face turned as white as a ghost, as if he had been reliving the nightmare that had haunted him for over a decade. He clenched his teeth and grasped his thigh tightly, knowing that he had voluntarily given up the option to choose a different evaluation method.

He could only suppress his emotions, staring straight ahead at the cruel world before him. The chandeliers above, which had once been adorned with luxurious decorations, now hung eerily still, with the bodies of the dead suspended from them. The dripping sound was the sound of their lifeblood dripping away.

On the floor, a man stood, his skin covered in black scaly skin, with half of his face covered in decay. His eyes gleamed with a fierce killing intent as he gazed at Zhao Xiu and Elton, his bat-like wings fluttering constantly at his back.

"Who, Peter, has he become a demon?" Elton exclaimed, covering his mouth in shock, noticing the horns on Peter's head.

"This is a half-demon," Zhao Xiu said nonchalantly. "Good people shouldn't take this path."

With that, Zhao Xiu snapped his fingers, dispelling the illusion surrounding himself.

Instantly, the woolen robe he had been wearing disappeared, replaced by a cloak that shone with starlight, fluttering in the wind. Meanwhile, the half-demon Peter let out a roar and charged towards Zhao Xiu.
