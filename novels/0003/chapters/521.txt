Chapter 522: Key Plot Twist, Species Transformation

As the dawn broke, the radiant light filtered through the lacy curtains, illuminating Zheng Xin Yin's face.

At this moment, she wore a look of puzzlement, slowly opening her eyes, her pupils radiating an incredulous expression.

"How is that possible?" Zheng Xin Yin muttered to herself, "Is it because I've been playing too many games recently, and my subconscious is reflecting that in my dreams?"

She immediately sat up, and the downy bedspread fell away, revealing the puffed-up pajamas underneath.

"It must be," she said to herself, "because the 'divine being' in my dreams is actually my own subconscious, so it's only natural that it would be omniscient and omnipotent."

"Because it's me, so it's as if I'm holding the reins."

As Zheng Xin Yin gently patted her smooth face, she chuckled, "Ah, Xin Yin, you really are a master of fantasy, imagining the end of the world and all."

"And that players can even bring their accounts into the game world, that's just too fantastical."

As she walked to the mirror, gently blowing on the air above her forehead to smooth out her hair, she couldn't help but smile sweetly.

Just then, she grasped her phone, which was charging on the bedside table, and prepared to go to the bathroom to wash up.

As she walked, she continued to scroll through the current hot topics on her phone. Suddenly, her hand stiffened, and the latest iPhone almost slipped out of her hand, falling onto the wooden floor.

Zheng Xin Yin was too stunned to react, her expression frozen in shock. She quickly rushed to her floor-to-ceiling window, yanked open the lacy curtains, and gazed out at the sea view, confirming that she was still on Earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

The headline on the hot search is the hottest news of the day. The wreckage of a plane that crashed previously has finally been found, and the long-lost secret has finally been revealed.

The question is, this "hot search" is actually a dream she had last night, and the one who told her about it is the one she met at the concert.

The memory in the dream is too fuzzy, and only now can Zheng Xin'an recall it. "This is actually true!"

Zheng Xin'an quickly turned around and walked to the desk, taking out a sketchbook from the stack of colored papers.

She kept recalling the memories in her mind, but the pencil in her hand could only draw a simple outline of a face and a cross before she couldn't draw anymore.

Zheng Xin'an realized that the image of the one who spoke to her in the dream was completely forgotten.

Even this speculation made her feel a sense of blasphemy.

Zheng Xin'an thought back to when she attended the concert and a mysterious and elegant man gave her an activation code.

She can't remember his appearance very well.

After playing the game, she realized that she had a guiding thread compared to other novice priests being raised, and it told her how to walk.

Half a minute later, Zheng Xin'an quietly put the sketchbook back in the stack of paintings, then took off her socks and knelt down in front of the open window, like a nun in a TV drama.

Then, she continued to recite the prayer-like phrase in her mind, her expression blank and puzzled...

"Great God, shepherd of the faithful on earth..."

In a dimension that humans can't see, Zheng Xin'an's expression emitted a mysterious thread, guiding her towards the sky...

(Note: I'll make sure to provide accurate and precise translations, without any unnecessary words or repetitions.)
Here is the translation of the text:

In a distant residential area, when the sun was about to rise, the lights of a certain house were already on, even before the sun officially rose. Zhao Xu, who was typing away on his keyboard, suddenly felt a stirring in his heart. He sensed that Zheng Xin'an was reciting a prayer in a distant location, just like Arthurian legend.

The voice trembled and wavered, from hesitation to determination, as if whispering in Zhao Xu's ear. He listened carefully and took a deep breath, realizing that he had taken a crucial step in connecting with his followers.

After cultivating Zheng Xin'an to a higher level, he would be able to lead her to establish a secret sect, relying on the protection of the goddess Lakshmi, and then inject the funds from the secret silver mine in Zhentian into it. This would give him an extra card to play.

Zhao Xu had learned many moral lessons, with many contradictions. However, there was one thing he believed without a doubt: "The Three Burrows of the Cunning Rabbit".

When Anny taught him, she gave him a formula, which said that when he reached X level, he would have at least X ways to escape. For the residents of Arthes, "survival skills" were the most important.

However, after the successful completion of the "Dream Ritual", Zhao Xu's entire body was still in an excited state, and he couldn't calm down. So he decided to re-open the account "Dong Cheng Ling" and edit last night's "Vampire Strategy Post" before finally publishing it.

That vampire who appeared last night, solo and arrogant, was definitely part of a group. If there was a player involved, Zhao Xu wouldn't fall into their trap, but would instead let them link up the two accounts, "Zhong Xia" and "Dong Cheng Ling", to trigger a massive response and let as many people as possible obtain the 28-point talent account.
Here is the translation:

So he edited another post, "What would happen if you were to cross-dress and be reborn as a species."

He chose the body of an "elf" or a "half-elf" player from Earth, and for ordinary people who don't have many complaints, the lifespan of an "elf" can be extended to around 600 years, which is much longer than the 28-day lifespan of a normal human.

As for some players who chose the dwarf or halfling species, Zhao Xiu still tried to come up with a way to save them.

This includes some special accounts that may transform into another species through a ritual, such as the "beastman" he saw today.

For current players, it's just a matter of deleting their account and starting over.

However, as a high-level player like Zhao Xiu, he naturally wants to take the route of inheriting his abilities.

Even he needs to publish this method as soon as possible.

The Archean species are actually hundreds of kinds, even including species that don't have a level adjustment of +0. For example, there are the day elf, fire elf, gray elf, moon elf, and Drow.

There are even species that can raise the challenge level, such as the descendants of the demon lord Tiefan and the heavenly descendants of Ahishmo.

These species are all costly for adventurers.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xiu thought the opponent's future was hopeless after seeing the vampire.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only a part of the monsters that have found the breakthrough can smoothly upgrade their profession. For example, those who have undergone late-stage transformation, like Zhao Xu, are impossible to catch. Otherwise, Anzhi Noya can easily transform into a giant dragon using the "Prayer Art". The key is that Zhao Xu's upgrade becomes more difficult after that. This is something Zhao Xu only learned later.

For most people, having an additional specialization as a "human" in many races, including the first race, is not a bad thing. Compared to the previous life, Zhao Xu has a clearer understanding of the key to strength.

After thinking for a while, Zhao Xu still decided to publish the article "If I Were to Cross-Dimensional and Reborn, How Would I Choose My Species?" online.

Although the methods described in the article can be achieved, it's uncertain how many people will actually take advantage of them. However, Zhao Xu still wants to spread this secret.

At least, let the regretful players know the way.

In an instant, countless players who had just woken up saw that "Dong Cheng Lian" had published a new post on the forum.

But to Zhao Xu's surprise, the players who had chosen the wrong species were confused about how to turn back into humans.

The players on the forum saw this post and thought that Dong Cheng Lian had found a bug in the game, providing a "direction" for transforming into other species.

Some players were so quick to copy and save the post, fearing it would be deleted in just a few seconds.

At this moment, countless players, filled with admiration, began to read this article, which was only a few hundred words long.

[Method 1: Prayer Art.]

Many people looked at it and shook their heads, skipping over it directly.

The Prayer Art and Miracle Art are names everyone knows, and they are aware that this is the top-level "Nine-Ring Magic" in the game.
Here is the translation of the text:

Its notable feature is its unpredictable power and unpredictable consequences. The problem is that it costs two million gold coins, and only a few people can afford it.

Method 2: Racial Transformation Ritual
Below this, there is no explanation, only two mysterious ritual category names written in Artesian language. Zhao Xu's intention is also very simple, because the ritual cannot be explained in three or two sentences. He left behind some keywords, allowing people to find their direction.

Players can quietly take note and prepare to search for related knowledge at the city library.

Method 3: "Reincarnation" and "Final Breath" in the Four Rings Spell
Although the Four Rings Spell is not currently accessible to players, it is at least the simplest way.

However, after taking a closer look, players are also getting a headache. The reincarnation spell allows players to revive after death in a new body. This is a spell that can bypass the "life limit".

The key is that they will revive in a random body. Gender is undetermined, and the species will be randomly selected from a list of: Bearman (1%), Dwarf (12%), Elf (12%), Wolfman (1%), Halfling (12%), Goblin (4%), Half-Elf (10%), Half-Orc (10%), Half-Human (12%), Human (15%), Dog-Headed Man (4%), Lizardman (1%), Orc (4%), War-Lizardman (1%), and others (1%).

The key is that this spell can preserve nearly all attributes and skill levels, except that it may reduce one level, and if the player is only one level, it will reduce two physical attributes.
