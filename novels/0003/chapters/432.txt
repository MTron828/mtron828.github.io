Chapter 433: Morning Execution

"Professor, did you see the mysterious script used to unlock the treasure box on the Element Lord?" 

After a moment of awkwardness, Zhao Xu reluctantly returned to the current situation, unable to go near the center of the explosion again. Even with An Ti Noya's help, he wouldn't have been able to retrieve the second key on the stone monument.

"What script? Oh, they've all returned to the four elemental planes." 

"What do you mean 'returned'?" Zhao Xu didn't expect this answer.

"Yes, after the four Element Lords were suppressed and returned to their respective planes, they naturally brought the scripts used to unlock the treasure boxes with them."

Zhao Xu felt a headache coming on as he hit his forehead. "Can I still unlock the fourth treasure box?"

Realizing Zhao Xu's predicament, An Ti Noya smiled sweetly. "Why worry about it? When you can use the five-ring dimensional teleportation, you'll naturally be able to find the remaining scripts in the inner layers of the four elemental planes."

Although Zhao Xu could use the power of the staff in his hand to cast the nine-ring "Stellar Projection" spell to search for the scripts, An Ti Noya still advised him to wait for a while.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but lift his head, carefully examining An Ti Noya.

It was worth noting that since buying the staff from the black market that night, Zhao Xu had never taken it out. Originally, he had bought it specifically for this expedition to the Aizhoudao Palace, but who knew that the mastermind behind the scenes was actually Ernest, leaving no room for him to use the staff to travel through dimensions.

Just how did An Ti Nuo Ya know he had a wand like that? And Vi Vi An said it was the Eye of May, but he didn't deny it, but it's not possible that it's also An Ti Nuo Ya's double-edged Eye. It's as if he looked through Zhao Xu's thoughts, and An Ti Nuo Ya's face almost turned red, "I think it's better to go back and take a course on the correct way of using magic."

"You don't think you're qualified to buy that broken wooden wand."

The silver badge flashed! Zhao Xu was startled and suddenly remembered that he was a member of the Mage Association, which was why he easily obtained permission to purchase the item from the black market in the town.

Of course, all these records will be reported to the local Mage Association.

However, Zhao Xu left for the explosion center before dawn the next day, so he didn't need to worry about the Mage Association's subsequent investigation.

Buying magical items is not just a matter of money; you also need to have the qualifications. Especially in large cities where magical items are traded, you need to be even more cautious.

If a fireball wand like this was sold to a madman, he might use it to blow up the city hall the next day. That would definitely be a trail that everyone would be unable to escape responsibility.

So, when buying high-damage magical items, it's usually necessary to have a guarantor, at least ensuring safety for the next 10-30 days.

Whenever a city investigates a case related to a specific magical item, they will trace back the magical items sold in the past few days.

This is also why Zhao Xu had to follow the rules and procedures to purchase the magical item that night.

It seems that An Ti Nuo Ya had already obtained the records within the past two days, which is why he knew about the magical item he purchased.

He didn't just come here on a whim, so he decided to take a look at him and ended up saving him that easily.

Zhaoxu knew that An Xinyue was not the type of person who had a lot of free time and could afford to live a leisurely life as a homemaker, which made him feel a bit warm inside.

However, just as Zhaoxu was thinking this, the conversation took a turn.

"What do you mean you're going back empty-handed?" the teacher asked.

Zhaoxu had already forgotten about the five treasures and An Xinyue, and he easily ignored his existence and directly started complaining to An Xinyue.

After entering the Alchemy Palace, he felt his own weakness acutely.

Especially since the power of the scroll that had been accumulated to the final volume had disappeared, and he had only managed to clear two levels with great difficulty. It was really embarrassing.

At this point, the "audience" outside the palace would generally think that he had obtained a divine artifact.

Zhaoxu was really eaten by regret and had become a laughingstock.

"Compensate?" An Xinyue asked, looking at him with a smile.

"This is a bit embarrassing," Zhaoxu said, looking embarrassed.

Just as he was about to leave, Viola, who had been awkwardly standing by, suddenly turned her head and pretended not to recognize him.

"No problem, just give me that statue and I'll take it. It's just what I need to collect," An Xinyue said with a smile.

"Ah, no need to trouble the teacher, I'll just take the loss myself," Zhaoxu said, still looking embarrassed.

Actually, controlling a dragon was just a matter of controlling a giant dragon, and he would still be subject to the giant dragon's prejudices.

"It's like he has just obtained two extremely powerful 'Gundams' out of thin air, and he won't be shortchanged anywhere compared to the Dragon Ball. 'Hmph, you're still daring to sell yourself cheaply?' Anzuela said, but she was actually handing him a similar notebook. 'Here, I got this for you in May. It helped you solve the giant monsters of darkness and find the location.'"

Zhao Xu looked at her with a slightly skewed mouth, as if he was looking at someone else.

However, as soon as he took the notebook, he immediately felt the difference inside.

"Teacher, what is this notebook -"

"Don't ask me, I would have copied it myself if I knew," Anzuela said with a wave of her hand. "This series of notebooks is actually pointing to an ancient tomb of elements from the distant past. You can organize a team to explore it yourself and find many treasures inside."

"I'll go to the Mage Association in Starfall first. Wait for me to finish dealing with the outside crowd, and then come straight to Starfall. This journey is your last test."

After saying this, Anzuela's figure slowly faded away.

Only Zhao Xu was left holding the warm notebook, silently looking at the empty hall.

"Vivia, don't be reckless," Zhao Xu said softly, patting the shoulder of the other person. "This Ai Duo Palace will burst out at dawn, and we'll be kicked out. We can take advantage of the night to escape the battlefield."

When Ai Duo Palace is reassembled, it's natural to think that someone has "advanced" and obtained a "divine artifact" before the investigation results are out.

At that time, he will face the "wolf pack" that is searching for the spoils.

Zhao Xu said he didn't obtain the divine artifact, but the other party doesn't believe him.
Here's the translation of the text:

"It's impossible for him to walk out freely, let alone prove his innocence with a single piece of evidence, just by relying on his own magical equipment. Moreover, he won't be able to prove it by cutting open his stomach like a sixth-grader. Everything is decided by 'Fists'. As long as he can survive until the city guard arrives at the nearby town after dawn, he will naturally be protected. The 'chaos' that lasted from dawn to morning was a test given by Anzhinoja to him. "Don't worry, Will, as long as my sword's light doesn't fade, no one can approach you," Vivian swore solemnly. Zhao Xu nodded silently, and the reputation of the Saint Warrior in Arthur's era was as valuable as a thousand gold coins. "Then let's prepare and wait for the dawn to arrive," Zhao Xu said. People won't think that he's strong just because he passed two trials. Instead, they'll think he found a secret and was lucky, and might even ask him for the secret to the trials. 'Dong, dong, dong...' Suddenly, a short and abrupt bell sound came, and Zhao Xu felt a sense of foreboding. However, he was too late to stop it. "Warning, the Eternal Palace will restart its return to the Heavenly Realm at 4 am, waiting for the next activation. All adventurers who enter will be left in the pit at that time." This thunderous and far-reaching voice spread to everyone's ears within a 50-kilometer radius of the explosion area in the dark forest. Even adventurers who had already fallen asleep were shocked awake by this sound. Suddenly, everyone's gaze turned towards the center of the explosion. This means that in a few hours, the center of the explosion will be where the possible holder of the 'Divine Breath' artifact, Zhong Xia, will appear!"
Here is the translation:

At this moment, Zhao Xu is standing in the grand hall. He was about to swear at the coarse language, but it seems that the Ai Zhuo Palace is intentionally playing with him. This is not a disguised order to hunt him in the underworld, but rather a notification to everyone that they can ambush him at the Meteorite Pit at 4 am the next morning. A moment later, Zhao Xu's heart was still not at peace, but he eventually regained his composure. He said calmly, "Vivian, prepare to kill."
