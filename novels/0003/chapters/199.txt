Chapter 200: The Truth About the Notebook

Zhao Xu was about to open the dimensional bag and examine its internal structure. Suddenly, Lark said, "Master, since this thing belongs to you, you can open it easily. However, you might attract some lingering odors."

Hearing Lark's words, Zhao Xu stopped his hand from reaching into the bag.

The dimensional bag was not like the "Howard Convenience Bag" Zhao Xu was familiar with. It couldn't automatically bring out the things he needed.

However, Zhao Xu still gained something from the bag. He began to fold up the bag-like dimensional bag.

Although the dimensional bag's appearance was similar, Zhao Xu judged that the bag in front of him was the "Dimensional Bag II", worth around 5,000 GP, with a 2-cubic-meter space. It could even hold 2 tons of water.

Even if the bag only contained a few gold coins, Zhao Xu didn't feel too bad about it. After all, he had just defeated a monster and mostly relied on divine items to buy his way through.

"Strange, Lark, why didn't I level up this time?" Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

In the past, he would easily level up after chatting and doing some trivial tasks.

This time, he had fought a monster with a level close to 20, but there was no reward? Otherwise, Zhao Xu would have reached level 4 and gained attribute points, allowing him to increase his intelligence to 22.

"Ah? Master, didn't you make a mistake?" Rakshasa said with a hint of a smile, "I've already obtained it, like the 'Tome of All Laws', my probability of shape-shifting has already reached 31%! Isn't that amazing?"

"1%," Zhao Xu replied, his tone incredulous.

However, this also means that Rakshasa may one day be able to freely transform into any artifact she wants.

Just then, a thought arose in Zhao Xu's mind.

"Rakshasa, do you also want to upgrade?"

"Yes, Master, the true form of me can freely transform into any artifact, not just one," Rakshasa replied softly, "So I need your support."

"And besides, Master, you can also take a look at this altar. There are secrets there," Rakshasa suggested.

"If we don't do it now, Mister Stra will come later and seal this place off. You won't be able to freely explore then," Zhao Xu said.

Zhao Xu's gaze then fell on the altar, and he slowly walked towards it.

The altar of Death God Nala was carved from a single block of jade, with a texture that was both beautiful and eerie. This material, aside from its own magical properties, was also extremely durable and resistant to external forces.

After over a hundred years, the altar was already devoid of any offerings, and the Death God had long since vanished. It was as if the altar had been abandoned.

Zhao Xu approached the altar and noticed that, aside from the original inscriptions, there was a layer of faintly boiling blood bubbles on the surface.

Was this just what the "Deep Hell Refiner" had painted on with his own blood?

Using his recent study of rituals and combining his knowledge of mysticism, religion, and spatial awareness, Zhao Xu made a rough guess about the contents of the "Deep Hell Refiner's" re-painting: it was to seize control of the altar.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's to change the direction of the altar from pointing to the abandoned realm of the dead god, to point to a layer in the depths of the underworld, or to say, it's its master. Laxus has already infiltrated the altar, so he immediately knows the devil's actions.

Zhao Xu nodded, and it's no wonder that he, a devil from the Order, has a firm concept of class. He took out a book of magical notes from his backpack, titled "Notes on Magical Incantations of Midsummer". He copied the ritual incantations he saw into the book.

At the same time, he briefly summarized what happened after he entered the underworld.

"Laxus, is this notebook okay in my hand?"

Zhao Xu and Laxus confirmed that this notebook was obtained from Andi, an ancestor of the devil, and was a legacy. "It's just a normal notebook that can record unlimited content," Laxus said, sensing something after a moment. "However, it's been tainted by the death aura of the tomb, and the owner of the tomb when it was alive must have had some real power."

A bit of power?
Can someone with such abilities be evaluated by Laxus, not above half-god?

When Zhao Xu received the diary, the first few pages recorded by Andi's ancestor contained the approximate location of the tomb and a simple sketch of the tomb's entrance.

If there are people passing by that area, it would be possible to explore it.

However, he hopes to reduce his expectations, as the place was explored by Andi's ancestor over 500 years ago, and it's possible that it has been transformed into a resting place for adventurers."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu was doing his homework while asking, "Laksis, did you deliberately bring me here?" He had come here because he had found a torn notebook in the sand heap, which was the starting point of everything.

"No, master," Laksis denied. "In fact, I was sleeping in that stone coffin from the beginning, and I only woke up when you entered. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left that 'deep hell' here so carelessly."

As soon as Zhao Xu heard this, he immediately reacted by casting a "Secondary Swift Release", but he had just used a "Higher Swift Release" and couldn't cast another spell of a similar type.

However, Zhao Xu's reaction was not slow, and he took out the notebook from his pocket and threw it in the direction of the distant altar.

At this moment, Laksis had just exhausted his strength transformation artifact and was unable to support him in the short term.

Zhao Xu took out his "Protective Staff" and prepared to face the ghost that had been intentionally led to him by the sand heap.

Suddenly, the notebook that Zhao Xu had thrown away began to vibrate and a faint, indistinct spirit slowly seeped out of the notebook and stabilized in the air, slowly taking the form of a human.

"Linghun," Laksis reminded.

Zhao Xu was also vigilant, looking at the unexpected ghost.

However, as a third-level cultivator, he was no longer as powerless as he used to be.

The ghost's true form was a middle-aged man with a painful expression, but with a military air about his eyebrows.

Zhao Xu knew he had met a comrade from his past.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why did you deliberately bring me here?" Zhao Xu asked.

It had been so long since Lei An had failed to find this temple by using that sundial stone, and yet he couldn't see any sign of this ghost's exceptional abilities.

"Just like you don't need to worry about me, my wish has been fulfilled, and I will dissipate on my own soon," the ghost bowed to Zhao Xu before expressing gratitude.

As it spoke, its faint light gazed at the pile of rotting corpse residue that had been constantly shrinking since the death of the devil. It was not that Zhao Xu didn't want to intervene. However, as long as the devils didn't die in the abyss of Baator, their corpses would continue to shrink until they disappeared, only to revive after a hundred years in the abyss.

At that time, the devils would transform into whatever level of devils depending on whether their former master had given them face.

Zhao Xu roughly understood the key points of the situation but didn't say much, instead waiting for the ghost's explanation.

After all, the other party wouldn't need to prove their words by dispersing their soul and flying away, and so they would have to continue discussing.

"You know, I was the commander of the Southern Flag Army 400 years ago, and I was tempted by the devil and sacrificed my subordinates' lives," the ghost said with a blush.

"You're foolish," Zhao Xu replied calmly.

Military units are more closely knit than adventurer teams. Zhao Xu's former subordinates also had many brothers who fought together in the seal of the devil and mutual trust in the war. Naturally, this betrayal was even more despicable.

If the other party was a destitute refugee who had been driven by desperation to make a living, it would be forgivable. But after all, who would care about so many things?
Here is the translation:

However, as a high-ranking officer, I, having received an education, fell prey to the devil's manipulation and ultimately ended up as a vengeful spirit unable to escape.

Zhao Xu would not understand sympathy just because the other party had fallen into an inescapable state as a vengeful spirit.

"It's true, I'm foolish," the vengeful spirit self-accused.

"When I sacrificed about seven or eight soldiers, and when one soldier's skeleton was excavated, the entire regiment fell into chaos, and soldiers began to flee every day."

"In the end, I told the devil that I couldn't continue the sacrifices, but instead received mocking from the other side, saying that I had sold my soul to them for revenge, and after death, I would only become one of them."

"At that time, I was not willing to give up, on one hand, I felt that my power was increasing every day, and my appearance was becoming more and more like that of the devil, but on the other hand, I was also afraid. So later, in front of this notebook, I committed suicide, and indeed, I did not become a devil, but became a vengeful spirit instead."

"Mr. Zhongxia, you killed that devil, and my wish has been fulfilled. The rest of the content is recorded in this notebook, and I hope you can keep this family heirloom, which was brought out from the tomb."

The vengeful spirit suddenly exclaimed: "That shameless woman married me for this very thing, so how could I let them have their way? They'll never guess that the thing they're desperately searching for is the torn notebook I carry with me every day, ha ha ha..."

The vengeful spirit's words had barely ended when the misty, condensed spirit form suddenly collapsed and dispersed in all directions.

"It was mistaken, and it has left the protection of the notebook. Its soul will reassemble and then fall into hell, reincarnating as a devil," Lixue spoke quietly.
When Zhao Xu heard it, he didn't say much.

When someone makes a mistake, they will naturally have to pay the price, it's just a matter of time.

At that moment, he also walked out to the notebook in front of him, which had truly revealed its true appearance after the ghost disappeared.

Or rather, its shape and appearance were exactly the same as the "Summer Magic Notebook" obtained by Zhao Xu from Andi.
