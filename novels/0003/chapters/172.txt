Chapter 173: Counterattack on the Battlefield

As the mage fell to the ground, Zhao Xun's heart tightened involuntarily. According to what Anzhiya had told him, if there were any casualties among the 20 people, his "Invisibility Ring" and "Fireball Eternal Magic Staff" rewards would be revoked. Zhao Xun could only hope that the arrow had not hit its mark.

Players' health points only decreased to -10HP before they died, so even a few dozen points of damage would not be enough to kill a level 1 mage instantly. However, after the arrow struck, several more arrows and spears came flying towards the players' formation from the forest. The new players immediately let out a chorus of angry shouts as they retreated in disarray, fleeing towards the back.

At this moment, nearly twenty orange-yellow or dark red goblins emerged from the underbrush. They were all over a meter tall, with most of them holding simple spears or hammer-like weapons. A few of them were even holding a single-handed shield. These goblins looked slightly different from the typical fantasy depictions of green-skinned goblins, with dull, glass-like eyes. The leader of these goblins, a large goblin, was wearing a blood-red cape with black stripes, and holding a longbow that seemed to be emitting a faint, subtle glow. It was clear that this large goblin had fired the arrow that had just struck. The goblin's mouth was smeared with a yellowish-yellow tooth, and it shouted, "Kids, kill these mages and take their equipment!"
In the face of this urgent situation, the mages in the front row, especially those with higher physical abilities, were frantically casting protective spells on themselves, and their various pets, such as toads, ferrets, and crows, were also fluttering and jumping around.

It was not that they didn't want to cast the spell earlier during their journey, but as 1st-level mages, their spell duration could only last for 1 hour without leveling up their spellcasting ability.

Unlike Zhao Xun, who could maintain the spell for 6 hours, even had a 2nd-level spell slot, and could combine it with the "Spell Delay" specialization to extend the duration of the "Spell Shield" to 24 hours.

Zhao Xun quickly approached the corner, his horse in tow, and at the moment he was about to cast the spell, he pulled out a block of beef tallow from his backpack, which was used as a spell material.

Zhao Xun then cast the "Oil Spell" directly on the path where the goblins were charging towards him.

As the incantation was finished, a layer of smooth oil suddenly covered the overgrown path, which was littered with stones and leaves.

The goblins, led by their leader, charged forward, but were immediately tripped up by the thick layer of oil and fell heavily.

The next few goblins also followed suit and fell to the ground.

For a moment, the original group of over 10 goblins halted their advance, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at their fallen comrades, as if there was an invisible trap lying in wait.

Although the goblins had a similar intelligence to ordinary humans, with a score of 10, they lacked the instinct for group combat and relied on intimidating their enemies to maintain their cohesion.

After witnessing this scene, the leader of the goblins shouted, "It's the Oil Spell! Charge forward and crush those stupid fools!"

As he spoke, he began to swing his long sword, as if trying to intimidate the goblins into attacking.
Here is the translation of the text:

After being intimidated by the eerie atmosphere, the few goblins nearby finally noticed that the oil slick on the ground was a three-meter square. However, Zhao Xiu had just cast the spell and discovered that his invisibility spell had not been cancelled, and he relaxed.

However, the invisibility effect of the ring of protection would be cancelled when trying to cast the spell at the enemy's area. Zhao Xiu had just cast the spell on the ground where the goblins were about to arrive, just avoiding this point.

The goblin who knew the oil slick spell was only looking at the retreating novice mages and had not looked in the direction of Zhao Xiu.

Arthas's spell distance can be divided into several types, including contact distance, near distance, middle distance, and far distance. Oil slick spell belongs to near distance spell, and its standard casting range is 7.5 meters. With each level increase, the casting distance can be extended by 1.5 meters.

Zhao Xiu relied on his 6th-level spellcaster level to directly cast the spell at a distance of 12 meters. Otherwise, he would have to take a few more steps to cast the spell.

Unless he could release the spell at a distance that could only reach the area where the novice mages were located, which would be a disastrous move against his friends.

At this time, except for a few mages who were hit by a magic arrow during the casting process and failed to cast the spell, the mages in the rear had already reorganized their formation.

They followed the original arrangement made by Wang Qingwei, and after being attacked, the middle squad would cast the attacking spell first.

At this time, Esveil also joined in, passing through the first row and directly releasing a "Seven-Colored Spray" spell.

Suddenly, the goblins were covered by the cone-shaped spell and fell to the ground. The mages who had released the "Mage Armor" spell saw this scene and turned around, holding up their wooden sticks to strike at the fallen goblins.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Zhao Xu saw the scene, his heart was set at ease, knowing that the battle was almost over.

Initially, the power of the earth elementals was no match for ordinary level 1 human warriors, and their magical abilities were also relatively weak.

The most dangerous wave in the team was naturally during the sudden mysterious attack.

At that time, the earth elementals would attack the group of mages, and if the mages couldn't cast their spells smoothly, they might be severely injured.

Zhao Xu released the "oil slick" spell to give the novice mages of the Mistra a chance to breathe.

As long as they could withstand the initial attack, they would have a surplus of 40-60 spell slots, and would naturally be able to wipe out the 20 earth elementals.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but let out a sigh.

He also began to feel the power of controlling spells, and he realized that a mere 3-meter-diameter oil slick could block the earth elementals, which were lacking in long-range combat capabilities.

If he had used the spider web spell as a spell material, and used the thorny bushes as anchoring points, the earth elementals would have been unable to move and would have been killed by the archers or mages with magical projectiles.

This was also a characteristic of the mage Arthur, who had powerful spells but was limited in the number of spell slots.

After more than half of the earth elementals were defeated, even the largest earth elemental couldn't save the remaining ten or so earth elementals that had been frightened, and they basically scattered and fled.

Meanwhile, Wang Qingwei advised the mages who wanted to pursue the fleeing earth elementals, and the group turned around and began to clean up the battlefield.
Here is the translation:

Among the fallen adventurers, the spiked hammer, leather armor, and banners, which were also the spoils of this battle, had been collected.

At this time, Zhao Xiu tied the horse to a distant location and, relying on his stealth technique, slowly approached the rear.

He was indeed worried about the few fallen players.

He couldn't help but say something, so he decided to release a "Light Wound Healing" spell to lift them up.

If a player's HP falls below 0 after being injured, they will continue to lose HP unless they receive good medical treatment or their body can stabilize their injuries. This is also the significance of a healer with a "Healing" spell in an adventuring party.

At this moment, Wang Qingwei walked over, looking down at the fallen mages.

"I have a healing belt that can cast healing spells," Wang Qingwei said, confirming that the three novice mages had only fainted.

Watching Wang Qingwei release the belt's spell, Zhao Xiu couldn't help but be impressed. It turned out that Wang Qingwei was the daughter of fate.

The "Healing Belt" artifact, known as the strongest low-level healing equipment, had been obtained by Wang Qingwei at this early stage.

This belt costs 750 gold coins, but it has 3 energy per day and can consume 1 energy to heal 2D8 (2-16) HP, 2 energies to heal 3D8 (3-24) HP, and 3 energies to heal 4D8 (4-36) HP.

The 2D8 healing amount is already the level 2 divine spell "Healing Medium Wounds" of the healer's skill. The spell can also add an additional healing amount equal to the caster's level.

So, the mage Arthur is eating and looking at the spell effects, from the spell distance to the various spell effects.
Here is the translation of the text:

Wang Ningwei immediately chose to treat each of the three people who had fallen to the ground with a treatment, just managing to pull them back from the brink of death.

Luo Lei, on the other hand, walked to the front and touched the ground where the gnomes had fallen, but found nothing.

"'Oil and grease' can be self-resolved," Esve said, standing beside him.

Zhao Xu's oil and grease could last for 6 rounds of time, but when he saw the players counterattacking, he naturally cancelled the summoned oil and grease to avoid hindering his own allies.

"Who just cast the oil and grease?" Luo Lei, who had always appeared cold and ruthless, asked.

Those who could be chosen to go to Mistral to study were all normal in terms of IQ, but lacked EQ.

When they heard Luo Lei's words, they too reacted.

In that instant, it was not casting a "shield of protection" to protect oneself or a "magic missile" to attack the gnomes, but rather casting "oil and grease" to hinder the players, playing a crucial role.

The players in the scene were all silent.

Jiang Shan, who was standing in the corner, tried to speak up but hesitated, not daring to take credit for it.

No one was a fool; he had learned some spells and shared intelligence from the start.

"It's really amazing, and we have a 21st member in our team," Esve said, slowly walking to the back of the team.

However, in front of him was a dense thicket, with no sign of human presence.

At the same time, Esve's eyes fell on the sandy ground, trying to analyze something.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, was looked at by the other side with a sense of unease, and he could not hide his own scent, sound, and tactile sensations.

He also couldn't help but lower his head and look around, wondering if he had left any footprints.
Here is the translation:

At this moment, the one being watched was clear that he shouldn't make any reckless moves, with twenty pairs of eyes fixed on this direction.

One misstep, and it would be impossible to predict whether it was the skills of some mage that had detected his presence.

Unfortunately, the mages in front of him did not possess the "Detection Net" spell, otherwise they would have piled up 40 levels of detection skills, and Zhao Xu would be completely untraceable.

"Grease Technique." Suddenly, Esveik muttered to himself, staring at the spot where Zhao Xu was standing.

Zhao Xu suddenly felt his feet starting to manifest a layer of grease.

He was about to be exposed!
