Chapter 241: Arcane Notes

After thinking over his plan for tonight, Zhao Xushi directly began to use Althor's transformation ability "Metamorphosis".
Instantly, he transformed into a clergyman-like figure wearing a board-like armor.
Under Zhao Xushi's deliberate arrangement, he assigned his 4th-level mage reputation to the account "Starlight Shadow".
As for his new transformed appearance, it was positioned as a magic goddess priestess born from Arthur.
In the end, being a priest is always good at communicating, even if he goes to the Mineral Association tonight, he can still get VIP treatment.
Tonight's infiltration plan, Zhao Xushi thought about it and decided to use the "Wind" identity, and basically he would be casting various high-level divine magic spells.
When those divine magic spells appear on the 4th-level mage, it would look quite incongruous.
After thinking it over, Zhao Xushi stood up directly and prepared to extinguish the fire in front of him.
Just as he was looking at the flames, he suddenly thought of Zhang Qi and others.
He originally wanted to take care of them, but was suddenly interrupted by the discomfort of his real body.
However, since it was like that, Zhao Xushi decided to take care of Zhang Qi's progress.
After breaking through the "Falling Star Lake" town, he would definitely search for the first batch of valuable items as the most agile player at that time.
And the remaining armor and weapons, he felt they took up too much space.
Naturally, he arranged for Zhang Qi to rush into the treasury and search for those weapons and equipment.
As for Zhao Xushi, who is now a top-level caster, he thought about what was happening and found it effortless.
It was just like the night he and Le'an went to look for Andy's whereabouts.
Here is the translation of the text:

One method is the "Biological Location" spell, but it has its drawbacks, such as being detectable and susceptible to illusion. Another method is the "Perception of Position" spell, which is less accurate due to limitations, unless the target has the "Mental Shield" or possesses a divine artifact.

Zhao Xu ultimately used a simulated miracle to simulate a higher-level spell. After completing the "Perception of Position" spell, a flood of information surged into Zhao Xu's mind, allowing him to immediately obtain Zhang Qi's precise location.

Zhao Xu had already surveyed the area around "Falling Star Lake" with his feet. He had even brought people to search for the bodies of murder victims near the lake's surface.

However, Zhao Xu did not recklessly teleport to the scene to take a look.

A well-prepared mage is a long-lived mage.

He directly pulled out a bowl from his backpack and poured in a bottle of 25 gold coins' holy water without hesitation, until a shallow layer covered the bottom.

"Higher Perception Spell."

After completing a simple spellcasting action, Zhao Xu's fingertips emitted a sacred glow, like a waterfall slowly pouring into the holy water bowl.

He was casting the seven-ring "Higher Perception Spell", which was not significantly more powerful than the five-ring "Perception Spell", but ensured that some "Detection" type spells could be cast through this bowl.

The seven-ring spellcasting time only required a standard action, unlike the five-ring spell, which took an entire hour, making it more convenient. As long as the target did not successfully resist the spell with a saving throw, the caster could see the target through walls or mirrors, but the mirror's range was limited to a 3-meter radius around the target.
Here is the translation of the text:

Not a few unscrupulous sorcerers love to use this spell to snoop on others, so corresponding shielding spells and fake spells also come into being.

At this time, the water's surface, reflecting the night sky, began to ripple and change into another scene—

Zhang Qi lay on the ground, his entire body in a state of unconsciousness, covered in bloodstains, with his girlfriend, Pastor Feng Ge, desperately performing CPR on him beside him.

Upon seeing Zhang Qi's uncertain state between life and death, Zhao Xu also furrowed his brow.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then directly applied a self-sustaining spell to his own body, then simulated the "Advanced Teleportation Spell" and transported himself to the location where Zhang Qi was.

At this point, he assumed the identity of a high-ranking priest of the Goddess Church.

"...Hurry up and escape!" a blood-stained Saint Warrior weakly shouted to his comrades.

However, he lay on the ground, having just awakened from a state of near-death, with a massive gash on his full-body armor and the heavy warhorse beside him looking sluggish, as if about to collapse.

"We can't escape," another male priest standing behind him shook his head.

His condition was also not good, having fought multiple battles and exhausted, barely able to hold his staff, and the "+1" heavy steel shield in his hand had a significant crack.

The priest of the Goddess Church continued to gasp for breath, feeling the burning sensation in his chest.

Behind him, only a few players, including his classmate Cui Lu, were barely standing, but the number was significantly reduced compared to what Zhao Xu had seen yesterday, with many having already returned to the Holy Temple to report.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Robin the priest, we have put you in a difficult situation," said Cui Lu, who was also standing tiredly. She had been responsible for the remote shooting position and had managed to survive until now.

Robin the priest shook his head, saying, "I have dedicated my life to this goddess, and I will die with honor."

Most of his powerful magic had been used to rescue fallen players and his teammate, the 5th-level holy warrior Et, who was also injured.

In fact, they were unable to inflict any significant damage on the giant in front of them.

The giant had just taken a few steps forward when he was noticed by a small team that had been observing them from afar. However, this small team was also heavily injured and had lost more than half its members.

The mysterious giant began to approach them again, his presence on the barren land making him seem like a demon.

The giant was almost as tall as seven or eight meters and weighed over six tons, causing the ground to shake with every step. Moreover, the sword in his hand, which was almost three meters long, was terrifying. If there was no defense, it would be easy to be cut down by this giant sword.

Robin and his companions had just finished fighting off a group of assassins who had been sneaking up on them and had managed to repel them. However, they suddenly encountered the mysterious giant.

It seemed that the giant was just annoyed by them, and he swung his sword without saying a word, then activated his "Great Flowing Slash," knocking down the entire first wave of teammates. Only Et, the 5th-level holy warrior, survived, while the other low-level players were killed on the spot.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just then, the giant unleashed a highly concentrated magic missile that struck five players with extremely high life values, instantly putting them on the brink of death.

Having confirmed that the team was unable to put up any resistance, the giant suddenly teleported to another team to annihilate them.

This enemy was completely beyond their match.

As the giant approached Robin, its massive figure and intimidating armor already exerted a tremendous psychological pressure on him, even from a distance of several meters.

"Hand over your spellbook, and perhaps I can spare your lives," the giant said.

"I'm a priest," Robin retorted, his tone unfriendly, as if to say he didn't have a spellbook.

"A priest of the goddess of magic, who hasn't even mastered some basic magic secrets?" the giant sneered, shaking his head. "Well, you can join them in going to report to headquarters."

As the giant raised his massive sword, which was still glowing with frost, he suddenly swung it down.

The players nearby cried out in shock, but it was too late to intervene. The nearby paladin could only grit his teeth and watch the impending tragedy unfold.

Suddenly, Robin vanished instantly, as if he had never existed.

The giant's heavy sword struck the ground, releasing a massive impact that created a crater.

Or, to be more accurate, it wasn't just Robin.

The entire team was inexplicably teleported to a spot about 30 meters behind them, as if they were chess pieces being moved around.

The giant also took a safe distance from the front, but he showed no surprise. His gaze fell on the priest who had just appeared.

The giant's immense magical knowledge allowed him to realize that this priest had cast a five-ring spell, "Dimensional Teleportation," forcibly relocating the team members about 30 meters away.
Here is the translation of the text:

As it turned out, the mysterious pastor who had appeared suddenly was standing closest to him.

"Mr. Feng, is that you?" Crui Lu, who had just stood up, recognized the pastor in front of him as the Mr. Feng who had mysteriously disappeared the night before. However, she didn't expect him to appear at this critical moment and save them.

Robin, who had met Crui Lu's team just today, was also curious and looking at the pastor in front of him who shared the same faith.

Not bothering to express his gratitude for being spared, he shouted loudly: "This giant is very dangerous, with the ability to manipulate portals and spells that are ineffective against the barrier."

After hearing the pastor's hint behind him, Zhao Xu just smiled faintly, having already known what the giant in front of him was through his angelic knowledge skills that exceeded level 30.

"Magic Goddess Pastor Feng," Zhao Xu introduced himself, looking at the giant in front of him.

"That's Tario," the giant said, as if he was very interested in Zhao Xu.

"What kind of 'arcane knowledge' can the mine owners bring out to ask you to come here?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask.

The giant in front of him, who was over 3,000 years old, had spent his entire life pursuing magical power, except for the Wind Giant. It was rare for him to fight with other races.

Just as he had hastily cast "Dimension Pull" to pull away the Goddess Pastor Feng, it was because the giant's sword attack intensity was over 30 levels, directly crushing everyone in the scene.

Adding to the damage caused by the giant holding a massive, genuine, heavy sword, there were hardly any in the scene who could withstand it.
Here is the translation:

"My research has led me to predict that the mage priestess of the goddess appearing here will have a crucial occult notebook on her person. The giant sorcerer spoke calmly. Then he swung his heavy sword with an unbridled ferocity and charged towards Zhao Xu, who is also a goddess priestess and his target."

Note: I've translated "赵旭" as "Zhao Xu" assuming it's a character's name, as it's a common Chinese naming convention.
