Chapter 638: Dragon Crystal Furnace, Three Dragons of Creation

With a fierce attack, he dealt 20 points of damage, 20 points of morale damage, and 5 points of leadership damage, pushing his physical output to a peak of 88 points, which is his standard damage with a single stab.

It seems exaggerated, but it's still within a reasonable range.

The key point is that, after activating the ultimate skill with 30,000 gold coins, he unleashed a 10-hit combo and combined it with the increased damage from riding, his attack output reached 44 times!

For every 1-point increase in fixed damage, he can reflect 44 points of final damage.

On the other hand, the added "Blazing Flame" effect, which adds 1-6 (1D6) floating damage, cannot follow the multiplier of the charge, so the actual multiplier is only 10 times.

This is the reason why fixed damage can crush floating damage.

When Zhao Xu spoke, the people of the Heavenly Realm couldn't help but exclaim in disbelief:

"It's really possible to reach this scale!"

Not only was he, but even Zhao Xu, who calculated this data, was secretly shaking his head.

Even some powerful mythological beings, such as the gods, might not be able to withstand his deadly 10-hit combo.

"That's it then."

Immediately, the entire Earth scene like a curtain was torn apart, with the surrounding mountains, horizon, and blue sky all becoming like a spider's web of shattered glass.

Zhao Xu slowly emerged from his initial "dream state".
Here is the translation of the text:

"Follow me, and I'll take you to a place. These people under you, I've already told them about in the Dream Kingdom, because you've successfully passed the trial and awakened. So they can all leave alive."

"They'll wake up, and as long as they follow the path I've left behind, with the undead creatures along the way being driven off, there won't be any major problems."

"Good." Zhao Xu also relaxed his mind upon hearing this.

Immediately, the "Human Heaven" transformed into a long rainbow shooting off into the distance, with Zhao Xu driving his own speed and closely following behind.

This time, the path brought by the Human Heaven seemed to be twisted and strange.

The road was treacherous, to say the least, with several hidden entrances that were extremely secretive and difficult to discover. It was not something that could be explained by a flat map, but rather a method of flying and teleportation.

No one could clearly indicate the destination, not even search experts combining detection magic. This also made Zhao Xu even more curious about the purpose of this journey.

"Just before we go, I suggest you raise your combat strength to its peak state," the Human Heaven shouted as it flew away, accompanied by the sound of breaking wind and reminding Zhao Xu.

"What?" Zhao Xu listened, and couldn't help but glance at his entire body.

"I can feel the footsteps of the God of Death approaching, and the forging location I'm taking you to may not be safe. They may attack at any moment."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu also explained, "Since I obtained the infinite potential points, my magical positions have never been unsatisfied."

Using magical positions, potential points restore magical positions.
Using professional skills, potential points restore skill usage times.
Unless it's magical items, Zhao Xu's body has never been unsatisfied.
Here is the translation:

"I'm saying that you have a super magical specialty that you haven't learned yet, and if I hadn't read your character card, I couldn't have imagined that such an exaggerated thing would happen."

"Generally, normal people after leveling up will not only solidify their abilities, but also learn their specialties. Especially for mages, their super magical specialties don't need to be trained through experience, but can be achieved through research and mastery of spells."

Zhaoyu's eyes twitched slightly when he heard this.

He immediately glanced at his specialty chart—

Familiarity with Magic (Defect)
Precognition (Defect)
Multitasking Mage (Human)
Magic Delay (Priest Domain: Strategy)
Transcription of Scrolls (Level 1)
Combat Spell (Level 1)
Pet Magic (Level 3)
Magic Twin Birth (Level 6)
Dragon Oracle (Level 9)
Magic Durability (Mage Level 5)
Magic Remote (Super Mage Shaper 2nd Level)
Magic Instant (Steel Will)
Magic Extreme Effect (Super Mage Storm)
Mighty Attack (Soul Attachment)
Unselected (Magic Guardian 2nd Level)

In fact, he obtained the potential points and relied on the ability to simulate his specialty, feeling that some super magical specialties with low usage frequency could be eliminated.

For example, Magic Remote is used to complement "Frosty Touch" and "Healing Spell" and other touch spells. However, it is not used every day. On the other hand, Delay, Persistence, Instant, Twin Birth, and Extreme Effect can be considered fixed combinations. Buff Magic Persistence and Delay, and use Twin Birth and Extreme Effect; in other cases, Instant is combined to allow him to cast two spells in one turn.

Looking at it this way, when his Extreme Effect expires, he can replace Magic Remote with Magic Extreme Effect.

But now, what super magical specialty should he choose?

Zhaoyu's heart was filled with a hint of confusion.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had three options of targets in mind.

One was "Invisibility", which wouldn't change any range, area, target, or damage, including any spell components. However, it could make the spell have no visual effects.

As a result, Zhao Xu would cast an "Invisibility" fireball spell, and no one would discover it before it exploded. It was considered a sneak attack of the first class.

Only when the high-energy thermal radiation caused by the explosion and the non-magical flames ignited by the fireball made the spell recipient realize they were being attacked.

However, true knowledge and the ability to break through illusions could still allow people to normally see the effects of this spell.

Another option was "Spellcasting Prodigy", which, when combined with a high three-ring effect, could increase the effectiveness of the spell by half. It was theoretically even stronger than the extreme effect.

If Zhao Xu learned it, he could say that he could deal with the line of spell damage with the "Strongest Extreme Combination", which could be equivalent to ten times the professional artillery mages.

The remaining popular options were also "The Son of Thunder", which was specifically used for lightning or sonic damage spells and could transform the spell into a "Thunder Spell" that was half-electric and half-sonic damage.

However, the recipients of the spell would be stunned for one round (strong will) or knocked down (reflex), and the spellcaster would also be dizzy for one round. However, this was not a problem for Zhao Xu.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu hesitated slightly.

"Are you hesitant?" the Heavenly God asked, still flying rapidly and magnificently, like he was wielding a sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're not as handsome as you thought you were, are you?" "That's right." Zhao Xu nodded slightly and made up his mind immediately.

[Summer, adventurer, your 2nd-level spell shield choice is "Invisibility".]

The dynamic bar completed this prompt instantly, and Zhao Xu had simulated this specialization using his latent ability earlier, so he could directly grasp it without any gaps.

This specialization is supposed to have no effect on anything, but it's just too cool.

Ordinary people can't even see the effect of this spell, let alone react to it. It's a must-have for killing people.

"..."

Even the Heavenly God was taken aback by Zhao Xu's sudden ability to activate this specialization.

"Actually, from my perspective, although the spell may not be effective against the 'artificial god of death', it's still safer to learn a more effective and reliable one."

"..."

Zhao Xu fell silent.

Feeling that his lifelong wish had finally come true, Heavenly God was about to joke around, but he didn't expect - Zhao Xu couldn't use logic to deduce anything.

Mastering the specialization took only a second.

"Whatever, I can also simulate it with latent ability later," Heavenly God consoled himself.

In this way, the two of them flew for about half an hour before suddenly arriving at the edge of a cliff. In front of them was a vast, seemingly endless chasm.

Zhao Xu began to slow down his movements as he approached the edge of the cliff, and in front of him was a gap of thousands of meters, like a giant ball-shaped space carved out of the earth.

Only when he reached the edge of the cliff did Zhao Xu stop in his tracks, gazing at the wondrous sight below.
Here is the translation of the text:

That's a deep, bottomless pit, but it's radiating a strong, red light, as if it's hiding a giant red crystal vein.

"This is the location where the Arthr dragons are buried. I suspect that this is where the ancient blood of the giant dragon, Arthr, has taken physical form."

"Have you heard the prophecy of the giant dragon?" Zhao Xun couldn't help but be astonished.

"Haha, you know that my first master, the spirit master Corallon, has a legendary story?"

"What is it?" Zhao Xun asked.

"In ancient times, it was said that he was the incarnation of a part of the ancient giant dragon, Arthr."

"That's impressive enough," Zhao Xun laughed.

"That's definitely true. The creation of the three dragons can be said to be the beginning of the Arthr universe."

"What creation of the three dragons?" Zhao Xun asked.

Zhao Xun also knew from the prophecy of the giant dragon that there were two other creation giants, which he didn't expect to be real.

"In the creation era, the two giant dragons that fell first were 'Order' and 'Chaos'. Among them, the keeper of order is the serpent dragon with a tail, and they are the earliest models of dragons. It was because of their fall that the entire outer layer of the Arthr universe was stabilized, and the core force of 'camp' was created, allowing the world to have order and chaos. The later creation giants of Arthr created the material world and various life forms in various planes."

"What about 'Chaos'?"

"I don't know, the power of chaos has wiped out all the traces about it, except for 'Order'. No one knows anything about it."

The Heavenly Court gradually revealed these ancient secrets to Zhao Xun.

"However, I heard from my previous master, Corallon, that the body of Chaos might be buried at the bottom of the deep pit, in the bottomless realm."

"It's said that the demons of hell and the evil demons of the deep pit are constantly fighting over this body."

Note: The term "亚瑟" (Arthr) is used to refer to the dragon, but it's unclear what the exact name or meaning is.
The text translates to:

"One side of Hell wants it, while the other side believes it's the beginning of their lives and is resolute in their refusal."

Zhaoxu couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. "Perhaps one day, I should really go down to the depths."

Note: Zhaoxu is likely referring to the Underworld or Hell, which is often depicted as a place of judgment and punishment in mythology and literature.
