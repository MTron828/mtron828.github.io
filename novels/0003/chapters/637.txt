Chapter 638: Dragon Crystal Furnace, Creator of the Three Dragons

With a forceful attack, he dealt 20 points of damage, 20 points of morale damage, and 5 points of leadership damage, pushing his physical output to a peak of 88 points with a single blow.

This is his standard damage output when he strikes out of habit.

It may seem exaggerated, but it is still within a reasonable range.

The key is that after activating the ultimate shield with 30,000 gold coins and combining it with the charge attack, his attack output can reach 44 times!

Every time he increases his fixed damage by 1 point, he can reflect 44 points of final damage.

On the other hand, the "Fiery Blaze" enchantment, which adds 1-6 (1D6) floating damage, cannot be amplified by the charge attack, so its actual output is only 10 times.

This is the reason why fixed damage can overwhelm floating damage.

As Zhao Xu spoke, the people in the Heavenly Realm couldn't help but express their disbelief:

"Who would have thought it could reach this scale?"

Not just him, Zhao Xu, who calculated this data, also shook his head in secret.

Even some powerful mythological beings, such as the Son of God, might not be able to withstand his deadly 10-hit combo.

"That's it, then."

The entire Earth scene suddenly tore open like a curtain, with the surrounding mountains, horizon, and cerulean sky dissolving into a spider web-like shattered glass.

Zhao Xu's entire being slowly emerged from his initial "dreamlike" state.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Follow me, and I'll take you to a place. The people under your feet, I've already told them in the dream realm, because you've successfully passed the trial and awakened, so they can all live and leave."

"They will wake up, and as long as they follow the path I've left behind, with the immortal creatures along the way driven away by me, there won't be any major problems."

"Good." Hearing this, Zhao Xu also relaxed his mind.

Immediately, the "Human Heaven" transformed into a long rainbow shooting towards the distance, and Zhao Xu also drove his own speed, closely following behind the other.

This time, the path brought by the Long Sword Human Heaven seemed to be a few turns and twists.

The road was treacherous, not to mention the several hidden entrances that were extremely secretive and difficult to discover. It was no longer possible to explain it with a flat map, but rather it was a method of flying and dodging like a heavenly being.

No one had explicitly pointed out the destination, even if it was a search expert combined with detection magic, it was impossible to find.

This made Zhao Xu even more curious about the purpose of this destination.

"Before we go, I suggest you increase your combat power to its peak state."

As the Long Sword Human Heaven flew away, accompanied by the sound of breaking air, it also reminded Zhao Xu.

"What?"

Zhao Xu heard it and couldn't help but glance at his entire body.

"I can feel the footsteps of the Mortal God approaching, and the place I'm taking you to may not be safe, as the other side may attack at any moment."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu also explained, "Since I obtained the infinite potential point, my magical positions have never been unsatisfied."

Using magical positions, potential points restore magical positions.
Using professional abilities, potential points restore ability counts.
Unless it's magical items that consume resources, Zhao Xu's body has never had an unsatisfactory state.
Here is the translation:

"I'm saying you have an overpowered specialty that you haven't learned, and if I hadn't read your character card, I wouldn't have imagined that such an exaggerated thing would happen?"

"Normally, after upgrading, people would solidify their abilities and master their specialties. Especially for mages, their overpowered specialties don't require traveling to train; they can just research and practice their spells."

As soon as he heard this, Zhao Xu also furrowed his brow.

He glanced at his specialty chartâ€”

Spell Mastery (deficient)
Precognition (deficient)
Multitalented Mage (human)
Spell Delay (pastor domain: planning)
Script Scroll (scroll level 1)
Combat Spell (level 1)
Item Summon (level 3)
Spell Twin (level 6)
Prophetic Dragon (level 9)
Spell Endurance (mage level 5)
Spell Remote (super mage level 2)
Spell Instant (steel will)
Spell Extreme (super mage storm)
Fierce Attack (angelic attachment)
Unselected (spell guard level 2)

In reality, he had already obtained the potential points and could simulate the abilities of some high-frequency usage super mage specialties, which he felt he could eliminate.

For example, Spell Remote was designed to coordinate with "Frostbite Touch" and "Healing Spell" and other touch spells. In reality, it wasn't used every day.

However, Delay, Endurance, Instant, Twin, and Extreme could be considered fixed combinations, with Spell Endurance and Delay always present, and Spell Twin and Extreme used in combination; in other situations, Instant was used in combination with other spells. As a result, when his Extreme reached its limit, he could replace it with Spell Extreme.

But now, there was another super mage specialty to choose from. Zhao Xu was naturally puzzled.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had three options for his goals.

One was "Invisibility", which wouldn't change the range, area, target, or damage of the spell, including any spell components. However, it could make the spell have no visual effects.

So Zhao Xu cast a "Invisibility" fireball spell, and before it actually exploded, no one would notice it. It was a sneak attack at its finest.

Only when the high-energy thermal radiation from the explosion burned and the non-magical flames caused by the fireball spell ignited would the target realize they had been attacked.

However, those with true knowledge, such as breaking through illusions, could still see the effects of this spell normally.

Another option was the "Spell Amplification" specialization, which could boost the effect of the spell by half when paired with a high-level spell. In theory, it was even stronger than the Extreme Amplification.

If Zhao Xu learned it, he could say that he could take on a professional pyromancer with ease.

The remaining popular option was "Thunder Child".

However, it was specifically used for spells that caused lightning or sonic damage, allowing the spell to become a "Thunder Spell". It would convert the damage into half lightning and half sonic damage. The key was that living beings affected by the spell would be stunned for one round, or even knocked down, and the spellcaster would be dizzy for one round. However, this was not a problem for Zhao Xu.

As he thought about this, Zhao Xu hesitated slightly.

"Hesitation?" the Heavenly Being said, still flying rapidly, even more so than the magical weapons with the "Dance in the Air" effect, as if he really had a swordsmanship technique.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're not as cool as you think you are, are you?"

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded, making a decision on the spot.

[Adventure Seeker Summer, you have chosen the "Magic Concealment" specialization for your level 2 magic shield.]

The dynamic panel instantly completed this prompt, as Zhao Xu had simulated it using his innate abilities beforehand, so he could directly grasp it without any gaps.

This specialization is supposed to be useless, but it's cool.

Ordinary people can't even see the effects of magic, and they're trapped in the spell's influence, unable to react. It's a must-have for killing people.

"..."

Even God's Heaven didn't expect Zhao Xu to activate this specialization instantly, and he couldn't help but feel a moment of hesitation.

"Actually, from my perspective, although the magic may not be effective on that 'artificial god', I'll just learn something more stable."

"...". Zhao Xu fell silent.

Feeling that his lifelong wish was finally within reach, God's Heaven, who had finally relaxed, was about to make a joke, but he didn't expect - Zhao Xu couldn't be reasoned with using common sense.

Mastering the specialization took just a second.

"Well, simulation can also be used to improvise," God's Heaven consoled himself.

As a result, the two flew for about half an hour, and suddenly arrived at the edge of a precipice. In front of them, it seemed like a vast, hanging cliff.

Zhao Xu also started to slow down his movements at the edge of the precipice, facing a void thousands of meters wide, like a huge, hollowed-out ball.

Only when he reached the edge of the precipice did Zhao Xu stop, gazing at the miraculous scenery below.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That is a deep, bottomless pit, but it's emitting a red glow with incredibly strong penetrative power, like it's hiding a massive red crystal vein.

"This is the location of the Arthurian dragon crystal. I suspect that this is the direct manifestation of the ancient dragon blood of Arthur."

"Do you know about the prophecy of the giant dragon?" Zhao Xu couldn't help but be astonished.

"Hah, you know that my first master, the Spirit God Corey, had a legend about it?"

"What kind of legend?" Zhao Xu asked.

"It's said that in ancient times, he was said to be a reincarnation of a small part of the ancient dragon Arthur."

"That's impressive enough," Zhao Xu laughed.

"That's definitely true. The three dragons of creation can be said to be the beginning of the Arthurian universe."

"What three dragons of creation?"

Zhao Xu also knew from the prophecy of the giant dragon that there were two other creation giant dragons that existed, but he didn't expect that they really did exist.

"In the creation era, the two giant dragons that fell first were 'Order' and 'Chaos', among which, the guardian of order was a winged dragon with a tail, and they were the earliest models of dragonkind. It was they who fell first, which stabilized the entire outer layer of the Arthurian universe and created the core power of the 'camp', allowing this world to have order and chaos."

"What about 'Chaos'?"

"I don't know, the power of Chaos has wiped out all the records about it, except for 'Order', no one knows anything about it."

The Heavenly Court slowly revealed these ancient secrets to Zhao Xu.

"However, I heard from my previous master Corey that the body of Chaos might be buried at the bottom of the abyss, in the bottomless domain."

"It's said that the demons of hell and the demons of the abyss are constantly fighting over the body that exists at the bottom of the abyss."
The text translates to:

"One side of Hell wants it, while the other side thinks it's the beginning of their lives, and they're determined not to give in."

Zhao Xu can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia when he hears this.

"Perhaps one day, I should really go to the depths of Hell."
