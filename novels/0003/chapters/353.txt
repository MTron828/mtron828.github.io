Chapter 354: Branching Out

Just then, a sudden cry for help echoed from a distant location.

"Let's take a look," Zhaoxu instructed the driver.

Even if they didn't hear it, as clergy, they would suddenly hear someone's plea for help and flee, only to end up causing their own team to become unbalanced.

This is also the reason why occupations like paladins, clergy, and druids are more likely to meddle in other people's business, as they possess stronger abilities. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to survive on their own.

At this point, the driver, though reluctant to get involved in this mess, still hastened to drive the carriage in the direction of the sound.

As the carriage went over the half-person-high heap of reeds in front, the view opened up, revealing a carriage identical to theirs parked by the roadside.

One of the carriage wheels had sunk deep into the mud pit, and a woman dressed in luxurious fur coats was leaning out to observe the situation. She was holding a small child in her arms, who was also looking curiously at the battle unfolding before them.

A sturdy-looking middle-aged man with a dark complexion, carrying a shield, stood guard in front of the mother and child.

Surrounding the carriage were eight bodyguards, clad in silver armor and wielding steel shields, vigilantly watching the cavalry troops ahead.

Outside the carriage, a brigade of riders on horseback was stationed.

Although many of the riders were on small horses that couldn't travel long distances, their lightweight armor made them formidable warriors.

The cavalrymen in front of them wore black armor with wolf-shaped designs, and they were still holding the reins of their warhorses, but they had knives and battle-axes attached to their bodies. They were staring intently at the people in front of the carriage.

"It's said that the Black Wolf Cavalry is hired by some big shots in Mistral to do some dirty work that's not seen in the light of day," someone said.

The driver, who was familiar with the roads around Mistral, explained that the Black Wolf Cavalry usually didn't rob merchants on the main road, but they seemed to be targeting this carriage in particular.

Zhao Xu frowned slightly, already suspecting something.

As they rode along, they saw a group of people who looked like they were about to fight. The Black Wolf Cavalry's leader, wearing a shiny suit of armor, shouted, "Hand over the child you're holding, Mrs. Beatty, and let us go back to finish our business!"

But Mrs. Beatty remained silent, and instead, her personal bodyguard, a burly man, shouted back at the leader of the Black Wolf Cavalry, "You're the ones who are coming to rob our lord, do you think you can take the consequences?"

The leader of the Black Wolf Cavalry sneered and waved his hand behind him, and the other twenty-odd cavalrymen drew their curved swords, which glinted with a cold light, and prepared to charge. However, the leader of the Black Wolf Cavalry didn't seem to care too much about the carriage driven by Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, he shouted at the horse-drawn carriage on the other side: "You're not thinking that just climbing up the tree makes you rich and noble? You don't even think about your own origins?"

Meanwhile, Betty in the center was biting her teeth, seething with anger as she glared at the surrounding cavalry troops in front of her. She knew that the child in her arms was the greatest bargaining chip, and if she lost it, she would have no way to turn the tables.

"'Betty'?" Eylton thought of this name at this moment.

"Heard of it?" Zhao Xu, who had not lived in Mistral in his past life, had only read about the upper-class families of Mistral and their crests, and was not very familiar with the middle-ranking powers. Especially after searching his knowledge of the place, he couldn't react to such a name.

"It seems to be the Purple Vine Guild in Mistral," Eylton fell into deep thought.

Guild?
Zhao Xu was not unfamiliar with such organizations, and he was even clear that the guilds in Mistral were the white gloves of the wizarding families, specializing in commercial operations and accumulating wealth.

Like the goose quill that could record magical spells, there were only three guilds in Mistral that were granted special operating rights, and behind them were countless disputes that had been settled.

At this moment, Zhao Xu was faced with what seemed to be a small-scale robbery, but in essence, it might be a small-scale representation of the entire power struggle of the wizarding nobility in Mistral.

However, the horse-drawn carriage of the Violet Vine Guild and the black wolf cavalry seemed to be stuck in a mysterious stalemate, with both sides shouting at each other but not attacking each other with swords.

As the shouting between the two sides continued, Zhao Xu heard a grand drama of aristocratic resentment unfold behind him.
After obtaining sufficient information, Zhao Xu again used his pastor's 1st-level profession "Knowledge" to search for rumors and combined it with his local skills to obtain a considerable amount of intelligence.

He then explained to the two people behind him, half-braiding and half-guessing the background of the current situation.

The Purple Bamboo Guild is a family-style guild that mainly engages in magic scroll trade in Mistra.

During this period, the guild's leader, Abell, remarried seven years ago after his wife's unexpected death, and had a son named Weberst with his second wife, Betty, who was already holding a position in the guild.

As Abell's physical condition deteriorated, the guild was gradually taken over by his original wife's son, Halley, and his stepmother, Betty.

Initially, the two sides lived in harmony, but suddenly, Abell suffered a stroke, was rescued by doctors and pastors, and lost half of his physical abilities. He became extremely weak and exhausted every day.

At this time, the underground currents of the guild began to stir, and Betty, feeling the wind direction was wrong, hastily took her son and fled back to her hometown in Frosty Town.

As a result, the scene unfolded where Abell's son, Halley, entrusted the Black Wolf Riders to block Betty.

For him, as long as he controlled his younger brother Weberst, he could basically prevent Betty from creating any waves.

"Commander, shall we save them?" Zheng Xinan asked.

At this point, Zheng Xinan knew that the other party was not a weak woman being coerced, and he did not have that kind of emotional knot. Although he looked down on such behavior, he did not intervene hastily.

In such a situation where no one knows who is right or wrong, impulsive action is easily become a butcher.
After seeing the situation unfold online, players have learned to take a step back and observe before acting. At this point, both sides are engaged in intense shouting matches, with the sound of clashing weapons echoing through the air, as if they are on the verge of a desperate battle.

Eliot looked worried, thinking that it might not be their turn to take action. However, when Zheng Xin'an asked for his opinion, he quickly shared his analysis.

"What do you think?" Zheng Xin'an asked curiously, her hand tightening around the bowstring of her lightweight crossbow. The arrow was ready to be fired at any moment.

This was the same bow that Zhao Xu had just given her.

Originally, the monster, Old Witch, had a defense ability of over 22 levels, and Zhao Xu hadn't planned for them to use their lightweight crossbows to attack. Without experience, they might accidentally harm their teammates.

Unexpectedly, this standoff happened, and Zhao Xu pulled out a new bow for them to use.

"Based on the situation, it's clear that the Black Wolf Riders are at an advantage, while the horse-drawn carriage has fallen into a pit but is not in a hurry to escape. It's likely that they think they have a chance to win. Additionally, the trading company, which is involved in scroll trading, may also have some notification methods. Right now, they are waiting for reinforcements to arrive," Eliot analyzed.

At this point, he also thought about the pendant with sand that Zhao Xu had given him, and then said, "In that case, it's possible that Mrs. Betty will surround and kill those Black Wolf Riders."

However, Zhao Xu just shook her head, saying that Betty had probably already realized that no help would come, and that her only hope was a one-in-a-million chance.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xinyu finished speaking and didn't wait for anyone to ask questions, when suddenly he saw the distant rolling sands and gray fog rising from the original post road.

A cavalry regiment of over thirty elite riders, led by someone from Shuang Lu town, was approaching from the distance.

Compared to the ordinary cavalry company besieging Betty's family, the cavalry company coming from afar was made up of heavy armor, with riders covered in dull black armor from head to toe, their faces obscured by helmets. In front, ten or so riders held long spears, exuding an atmosphere of solemnity.

"Retreat," Zhao Xu ordered the driver in front.

As the eldest brother, Harry followed the tradition of Mistrall and the pressure of the church's influence, ensuring that the final outcome would be that his younger brother Webster would be monitored for four or five years until Betty's family was completely eliminated.

Next, they would put on a show, but it would be unconventional, with a hint of taking advantage of the situation.

Zhao Xu, who didn't want to stir up trouble, naturally decided to retreat.

As he saw the approaching cavalry's identity, he felt a strong sense of bloodlust emanating from them. Betty immediately realized that the people coming to rescue her family members were probably going to be killed by this cavalry company from Shuang Lu town.

Her eyes reddened, but she clutched her child tightly and looked at the leader of the new cavalry company, constantly thinking about their escape route.

Just as the coachman lightly raised the whip and prepared to drive away, there was a loud "thud" sound, and an arrow with a falcon's feather fell on the outside of the carriage, even piercing the weak part of the carriage door.
The cavalry leader surrounded by Betty's troops suddenly turned his horse around, leisurely gazing at Zhao Xiu on the other side, and asked, "Friend, have you watched this play for so long, and you still don't want to trade something for a smooth departure?"
