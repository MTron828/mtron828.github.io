Chapter 346: Super Magical Control

As Zhao Xu walked out of the transmission portal and returned to the ground of Mistrals, his heart was still racing.

He almost wanted to scold himself for being too slow to react to the name "Anniya" and its basic word origin.

However, he also partially understood the reason why Anniya always wore a hood.

Although Zhao Xu had always heard Anniya's soft and sweet voice, he couldn't tell her age from her tone, which seemed not to exceed 20 years old.

But when he finally saw Anniya, who looked like a high school student around his age, he felt a bit awkward.

To be blunt, with his age of 30 in his past life, many men of his age would have daughters around Anniya's age.

The "Suiyue Wuhun" spell allowed Anniya to lock in her age, and as long as she didn't remove the pendant, she would always remain a youthful girl under 20 years old.

Not to mention dignity, if Anniya were to sit on the ground, Zhao Xu would even have the urge to pat her head and tousle her hair.

As his disciple, he was already like this, and almost all the high-level mages in the floating city would find it difficult to show respect to Anniya.

Zhao Xu had looked at the legendary mage's chronicle, where most of them had considered their physical appearance and were generally in their middle or old age.

In the Arthurian era, people went through three stages of life: middle-aged, old, and elderly, with each stage experiencing a decline in physical strength, agility, and intelligence, resulting in a total decline of six points.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Intelligence, perception, and charm are strengthened one by one, ultimately enhancing the three points. For casters, many wizards are accustomed to accepting this "aging" effect, even if they lose more severely in the first three aspects.

"Ah," Xu Zhao sighed after a while. After seeing Anny's true appearance, he almost imagined dressing her in a JK school uniform, and he himself had a perverted thought.

Xu Zhao directly snapped his fingers and cast the "Magic Duo" spell, summoning a chilly feeling that cleared his mind.

As he suspected, Anny's "charm" attribute may be stacked to an uncalculable extent. Naturally, he took a glance and became deeply fascinated by her appearance in an aesthetic convergence scenario.

With the cooling sensation, Anny's figure became slightly blurred in Xu Zhao's eyes.

Xu Zhao regained his composure and carefully examined his "Advanced Profession Ability".

Originally, dual elites only allowed a single path of advancement. However, Xu Zhao had once sworn an oath to the magical source, allowing him to break through this limitation.

As a result, this time, he advanced in both arcane and divine magic.

At this moment, his arcane caster level reached level 6.

As for divine magic, his 1st-level priest remained independent, and his 1st-level curse-warden was stacked onto his 4th-level "Scholar of the Tome" level, making him equivalent to a 5th-level divine caster, thereby acquiring three-ringed divine magic.

Xu Zhao gazed at his advanced arcane profession, "Super Magical Sculptor".

This profession has three prerequisites.
Here is the translation of the text:

The first prerequisite is the skill foundation, where knowledge (mystical) is at 5th level, spell recognition is also at 5th level, and craftsmanship (sculpture) is at 3rd level. After preparing for over ten days, he has significantly improved his craftsmanship and can now create a statue that looks exactly like the original.

The second prerequisite is that he must master two exceptional magical specialties. Zhao Xuan has mastered the magical specialties of "Instant Spell Release" (replacing "Steel Will") and "Spell Persistence" (5th level mage reward), which satisfies the requirement.

The third prerequisite is that he must be able to cast a three-ring spell. There's no need to mention the details.

In summary, the prerequisites for this upgrade are not particularly demanding, even if there are requirements for exceptional magical specialties. Only a few high-ranking members of the association know the truth about this long-sealed "upgrade profession".

Furthermore, only Zhao Xuan and a few high-ranking members of the association know the truth about this long-sealed "upgrade profession". Even more exaggeratedly, every time Zhao Xuan acquires an exceptional magical specialty, his combat effectiveness will show an exponential increase.

At this point, Zhao Xuan looked at the 1st level profession ability of the "Super Magical Control" profession.

This profession ability allows him to perform super magical operations by absorbing attribute damage. Generally, spellcasters want to make their spells super magical, but they need to prepare the required ring spells. For example, a zero-ring "Detection Magic" spell that wants to be released instantly must be paired with the "Instant Spell Release" exceptional magical specialty, which costs a four-ring spell slot.
Here is the translation of the text:

It means that Zhao Xu needs to use a "Magic Instant Detection" spell to prepare, which requires a four-ring magic circle, something he is currently unable to do.

At the same time, the "Spell Amplification" in the "Super Magic Art" has effects such as "Spell Amplification" and "Spell Enhancement", making it harder to be waived by "Spell Promotion".

Therefore, despite being saddened, wizards will still learn a few key "Super Magic Arts", especially those related to casting time, such as "Instant Spell".

For Zhao Xu, who has "Super Magic Control", he no longer needs to increase the ring number to cast super magic.

For example, the "Instant Fireball Spell" requires four rings, but Zhao Xu's "Instant Fireball Spell" is still a three-ring spell, with the difference being that his attribute will decrease by four points.

Moreover, the attribute can be restored, even through a simple rest.

For instance, "Spell Recovery" and "Secondary Recovery" are effective methods to restore attribute damage, but he needs to pass a difficulty 20-level spellcasting test.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu directly walked into the "Holy Heart Cathedral" next door, picked an empty room, and sat down to meditate to obtain today's divine magic.

After a rough hour of preparation, Zhao Xu refreshed his prepared magic sequence and was able to cast a three-ring spell.

The "Super Magic Control" ability consumes attributes and can be restored through methods like "Recovery", but it's not strong enough.

Zhao Xu needs a one-time solution.
Here is the translation:

It was impossible for him to fight while also recovering his attributes. At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath and slowly cast his new acquired three-ring priest skill, "Energy Shield".

As he cast his spell, a soft, warm light appeared in his palm, similar to a priest's healing spell. As long as this warm energy touched a target creature, the spell would take effect. Compared to distance spells, this "contact" spell was indeed riskier, but Zhao Xu didn't have any obstacles this time since he was casting the spell on himself.

Zhao Xu immediately pressed the energy towards his chest.

【Adventure Seeker, you have cast "Energy Shield" on yourself, immune to fatigue, exhaustion, attribute damage, and attribute absorption effects (regardless of their origin) for 7 minutes.】

Immunity is the strongest defense.

Zhao Xu continued to experimentally activate his "Super Magic Control" ability in his mind, then merged it with his two-ring spell "Ghost Strike" and the "Spell Prolongation" specialization.

Instantly, the Super Magic Control ability also reflected a damage of 6 points to Zhao Xu's physical attribute. Zhao Xu directly redirected it to his physical attribute.

【Adventure Seeker, your "Energy Shield" spell has absorbed 6 points of physical damage from "Super Magic Control".】

【Adventure Seeker, you have cast "Ghost Strike" (Spell Prolongation) on yourself, duration: 24 hours (originally 1 round)】

Two prompts directly notified him that he had succeeded.

Seeing this scene, Zhao Xu, despite some psychological preparation, still felt his heart racing wildly.

This means that from now on, all spells in the format of "Spell Prolongation" in his hands will become 24-hour spells.
Here is the translation:

In the future, he can easily cast spells with just a flick of his hand, which is an instant casting spell. Know that the "Instant Casting Staff" he is holding is only worth 170,000 gold coins, limited to three uses per day. As for Zhao Xun's "Super Magic Control" ability, there is no limit to its use, unlike the "Holy Super Magic" mastered by the priest, which is limited by the number of undead creatures he can resurrect.

With his super magic specialization increasing, from then on, when others see his fireball spell, it will be accompanied by effects such as "Instant Casting", "Spell Amplification" (full damage), "Spell Strengthening" (+50% damage), "Spell Advancement" (increased difficulty), "Spell Expansion" (expanded area), and "Spell Twins" (two fireballs).
