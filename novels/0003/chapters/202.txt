Chapter 203: Unrestricted Mage

"Lu, do you know anything about this 4th-level mage?" Mò Xīn Jiàn looked at his phone, where a hot post on the forum had caught his attention, and fell into deep thought, even letting go of the chopsticks in his hand.

At that moment, a girl sitting across from him, eating a boxed meal, heard the old man shout out his game name and immediately thought of the man who had once spent 22 minutes copying a skillbook. She then shook her head.

That mysterious player was strong, but not strong enough to reach this level so quickly. Half a month ago, he was still a 1st-level mage. How could he suddenly become a 4th-level mage?

Mò Xīn Jiàn saw Lu shaking her head and didn't ask any more questions.

When the game first launched, he had insisted that everyone quit their original game and join this one. However, after half a month, the group of traditional high-rollers who could achieve efficiency several times that of ordinary players had all lost their abilities. It was even to the point where the old boss of Mò Xīn Jiàn's studio had to personally come in to work, and Lu had to give up her hard-earned character and switch to a mage profession to ensure the completeness of the team's personnel.

This was all thanks to his decision to enter the game early, unlike other studios that entered the game slowly, with some of them still stuck in profession training.

Mò Xīn Jiàn had always found it strange that the game's thought process was to care for old players, but at the same time, the game had a revival stone limit. If you didn't care, only accounts that had registered and logged in on the first day would have an additional 4 points of attribute points, and he had already basically exhausted his options after this round of manipulation.
Here is the translation of the text:

This account bound to the iris can only be used by oneself after logging in, and there is no reward for the first login.

Like other game studios, everyone initially doesn't know how important the innate points are, and they all think about registering a new account when needed, without paying too much attention to the opening rewards. Even if they prepare a few accounts to receive the opening rewards, it's not a big deal.

Looking back, 4 innate points can only be exchanged for 1 property point, which is equivalent to 4 property points. Currently, it has a huge advantage.

In the current server, only those 4-level players who have opened up new property points can start to obtain new property points.

As for equipment that increases properties, he has heard of it but has never seen it. Even the big game studios that invest a lot of manpower and resources have not found a +4 property equipment.

The market price of +2 property equipment has already exceeded 100,000 yuan, but it still can't make up for the gap in opening rewards.

However, Arthur is not a game where players can level up by killing monsters alone. There is also a profession training system that blocks the way.

So, only those true gamers and gold players who are passionate about playing games and have innate talent can stand out.

Even if they invest more resources than other players, they still can't reach level 2.

The circle of Moxin Jian now has a consensus: when the old players who registered at the beginning reach a certain intensity, combined with the recent discovery of the five-ring revival spell, they and the first team players will create an insurmountable gap.

This is also the reason why Moxin Jian is anxious every day: the current momentum must be seized, or the gap will be irretrievable.
Here is the translation of the text:

The player hasn't felt it yet, but he has a profound understanding of the number of Arthur's daily active players. The daily active players of Arthur show a normal increasing trend, and it's just waiting for a hot event to trigger a massive influx. He has also learned that the European and American servers will be launched in half a year, but only international players can register for accounts, which will log in to the same city as domestic players. At that time, Arthur will welcome a massive influx of players.

Thinking about this, Mu Xin Jian's eyes again fell on the 4th-level account. The note "4th-level mage" has been intentionally bolded and highlighted by the moderator, indicating that they are also eyeing it. 4th-level warriors are nothing to talk about, but 4th-level mages are simply unbearable.

Even though he has been working with his uncle since he was 18 and has seen countless ups and downs, he still feels envious when he sees this number. Players see 4th-level characters appear and feel a sense of admiration and admiration for how they achieved it.

However, these studios that have always been at the forefront of the gaming industry will understand that it's all about the money! At least, his QQ group has had over 20 private chats asking for inside information. Those who have inside information can sell strategies for a big price. It's not like the first month when everyone was obsessed with professional training cards and Arthur's products were flooded with negative reviews on the TC market.

After players complete their training and officially become 1st-level adventurers, it has become a symbol of pride. Those who haven't graduated are not game-challenged, but rather, they are not up to par. The sour taste of lemons has enveloped the entire forum, causing many abandoned players to see their friends succeed in leveling up and return to their original adventure life with renewed enthusiasm.
Here is the translation of the text:

As players continue to explore, the mysterious and extravagant content of Asera has attracted many new players. This excitement has led to a steady increase in daily new registrations.

"Older brother, don't waste your time, we don't have that kind of money," said Cheng Xu, eating a BBQ dish, "If there were ten to fifteen servers, each server would have a first-place player, but Asera only has one server and no internal purchases."

"This is a situation where everyone in the entire server is looking at a 4th-level player dressed up, with a group of 2nd-level followers beneath him," said Cheng Xu. "I'm also going to get rich by secretly raising a bunch of high-level accounts first."

Just then, the studio's financial manager, Lao Zhao, chimed in, "Get rich? You'll only be able to work your whole life."

"I'm just going to shout out one call, relying on the current number of Asera players, whether it's a public number or a streamer," said Cheng Xu. "As long as we seize this opportunity, we'll be financially free. You should know that yesterday's data showed that at least 20% of players with high innate abilities chose to buy new accounts instead of keeping their existing ones."

"What's he hiding?" Cheng Xu asked. "And mainly, it's just him alone. We in the studio know that a single person cannot achieve anything meaningful."

"Even a 4th-level mage with full concentration will still be killed by someone in an instant," said Cheng Xu. "It's better to join a team and at least protect yourself."

"Ah, it's hard to replicate someone else's formula," said Lao Zhao, collecting his leftovers and making a joke to the few people still eating outside. "But maybe he'll show up and explain himself after seeing the hot forum posts tonight."

The remaining people outside, however, just looked at each other in silence.

Can you rise to the 4th level by yourself? That would take a lot of face to say such a thing.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this point, Zhao Xu had leveled up to 4th grade, and the upgraded effect of the "Spellcraft Notes" in his hand had already disappeared. Even if he let someone else read this "Spellcraft Notes", it would be of no use.

"Your strength has increased again, master," Larky said, approaching him with a warm smile.

"It's okay," Zhao Xu replied, taking a moment to review his abilities. His skill points had been fully allocated, so he had no obstacles to upgrading this time. His attributes, including his life value and skill points, had all been accounted for.

As a 4th-grade mage, he did not have any additional abilities. However, his "Dark Knowledge (Tactics)" skill increased to four times a day.

Zhao Xu was aware that, with his "Dark Knowledge" and "Knowledge Devotion" abilities, he had become a powerful team attack buff. When combined with his divine arts, he was almost invincible.

He could only serve as a support character, and the team's personnel configuration would need to be rational. This was unlike his previous team-up with Wang Qingwei, where they had three mages, which would have been weak in the early stages. However, after this upgrade, his team would likely be the strongest in the current league.

As for the high-level stages, it would be three mages combining their powers to crush everything.

However, this upgrade meant that Zhao Xu's first career path was a standard 4th-grade mage, but his second career path had become 1 pastor/3 scroll, allowing him to master two-ring divine arts.

If Zhao Xu had mastered two-ring divine arts, he wouldn't have to worry about the first wave of "Blunt Impact" damage. He could easily cast the 2nd-grade mage spell "Shield of Protection" with his palm.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

This spell, which can be cast without thinking, creates a spherical shield with dragon wings, capable of deflecting the first strike from close-range, long-range, or magical attacks, regardless of whether it's a single point of damage or a billion points of damage. This is a concept defense, forming an absolute barrier. It's also magical.

This spell has made countless wizards envious, and it's a skill that even those who can't grasp it are amazed. However, after transforming it into a divine spell, Zhao Xu was able to learn it by relying on his profession's characteristics and the art of copying spells.

This also means that he has obtained the right to survive for the first time. In the past, An Ti Niya used this spell to block the attack during her first trial. At that time, she was simply showing off to him, and they would have various ways to respond to attacks in the future.

This also means that Zhao Xu has evolved into a "wizard" who cannot be defeated. Moreover, he has "Wings of Protection" and "Secondary Quick Explosion" on one hand, and on the other hand, he has "Multitalented Caster" and "Precognition" that allow him to break through the limitation of needing to prepare spells.

As a result, even if a wizard is limited by the number of spell slots, he can still rely on his abundant spell resources to start a snowball effect, ultimately achieving a state of crushing. Not to mention that Zhao Xu has broken through the rigid barrier of needing to prepare spells with his "Multitalented Caster" and "Precognition".

He has become a wizard who can freely cast spells and has a vast array of spells, and the difference between him and traditional wizards who rely on mana points is almost negligible.
Here is the translation:

After he officially reached the 9th level and his magical abilities continued to grow, he could also abandon the weakness of limited magical slots. He became a caster of unlimited magical slots, unrestricted magical tables, and unrestricted forms of casting. In the online game, he was a mage who could cast thousands of spells.

"Master, they're here," Lacis reminded him.

Zhao Xu also suddenly realized and turned around to look at the stone door he had passed by earlier.

He had a headache, and the remnants of the "Deep Prison Refining Demon" in the corner were still there.

He didn't know if Rayan and the others believed that "Deep Prison Refining Demon" was a way of self-destruction.
