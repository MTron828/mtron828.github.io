Chapter 29: The Elder Mage

Zhao Xū was on the verge of shouting out loud because of the people sitting below staring at them. After a moment's pause, he finally realized that An Ti Nuo Ya was just joking.

"You're not serious, are you, instructor?" Zhao Xū said with a smirk.

"I'm not joking," An Ti Nuo Ya said. "We can just send a legendary mage to handle it. We don't lack legendary mages, and as long as someone is willing to put in the effort, the headquarters won't have a problem with it."

"Even if it's just once a month, it's no big deal," Zhao Xū said.

Zhao Xū, despite knowing he was being unreasonable, still couldn't help but take a deep breath when he heard this. A 17-year-old mage who can cast 9th-level spells can't even think about becoming a king, let alone a high-ranking official. It's not about whether you can do it, it's about whether you want to.

Think about it, and you'll realize that a 21-year-old or even higher-level legendary mage faces problems that are on a whole different level, problems that require them to save the world.

Zhao Xū thought about this and couldn't help but feel a bit of sympathy looking at Wang Qing Wei's corner. These players, who had just woken up, had basically been held back for five days, or even longer. There may be some who are suppressing their thoughts, striving for the honor of being the first to complete mage academy training.

Unfortunately, this is Mistral, where countless top-notch mages with exceptional talent have been sent over the centuries. Even the strongest geniuses must bow their heads here.

Zhao Xu's gaze slowly swept across the group of native magic apprentices, looking at Arthur's apprentices with a hint of surprise. "Teacher, is there a method to increase a mage's innate talent by spending money?" he asked.

Anzhi Noya followed Zhao Xu's gaze and glanced at him. "You've got cause and effect backwards."

"I'm asking you, if you were a lord or king, would you send your children to become a mage or a warrior?" Zhao Xu finally fell silent.

The native magic apprentices, all wearing the same uniform robe with a badge on their chest, caught Zhao Xu's attention. As someone who had been a bodyguard, he had a keen eye for spotting the nobility among them.

The unusual number of nobles among the apprentices made him hesitant to ask.

"Directly increasing a mage's innate talent is to boost their intelligence attribute," he said.

"However, among those people, those who have read 'The Silent Thinking Tome' or have received the 'Blessing Art' to increase their intelligence attribute won't exceed five people."

Zhao Xu turned his head to look at Anzhi Noya.

Even nobles couldn't enjoy the "Blessing Art", but the woman in front of him had simply demonstrated it for herself.

If there were no players present, Zhao Xu would definitely mutter to himself, "The fragrance of the noble's mansion is stale, and the road is full of frozen bones."

"Don't think too much, I just demonstrated it once. The upper limit of intelligence attribute increase is 5 points, and not everyone can easily consecutively perform the 'Blessing Art' five times."

"A mage can increase their intelligence attribute by 5 points, mostly through reading the '+5 Silent Thinking Tome'."

"If you can accumulate 13,500 gold coins, I can sell one to you. The market doesn't have it for sale."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's heart was secretly muttering to himself, he wouldn't dare to be so greedy, and he would be satisfied with just a few points of intelligence added to him.

Five wishes, who could imagine?

But even if he had the ability to smuggle silver coins, he would still need at least five million yuan.

If we convert it to gold, four billion yuan would be even more unthinkable.

In the previous life, most players were struggling to make ends meet.

Suddenly, the large door at the front of the hall, which was half-closed, was slowly pushed open by someone.

An old wizard, who looked to be in his late 70s or 80s, walked in with a cane that reached almost a meter in height.

The new wizards in the hall, including Zhao Xu, all straightened up and sat up straight, revealing a dignified and solemn expression.

As Zhao Xu gazed at the old wizard's dignified appearance, he couldn't help but nod in respect.

In fantasy stories, wizards' abilities are usually tied to their age, except for this old man beside him.

"Teacher, that metal cane looks really cool. When I attend the lectures, I've seen many wizards carry canes. Will I get one after I join?" Zhao Xu asked.

Anzhiya glanced at Zhao Xu.

"You know a lot sometimes, and sometimes you don't know anything at all. That is a 'High-Level Super Magic Instant Release Cane', which can make your spells instantaneously three times a day."

Zhao Xu was shocked by the sudden revelation and immediately asked, "How much?"

"17 million gold pieces," he replied.

Zhao Xu suspected he had misheard and asked again, "How much?"

"You didn't mishear, this is the most expensive one in the Super Magic series."

Zhao Xu could only suppress his excitement.

"I knew it, wizarding items are not measured in gold coins, but in gold pieces."

This expensive item is something that players would definitely not be able to touch in their first year, so he didn't recognize it.

Zhao Xu had previously come into contact with the wand, which was roughly the size of a multifold scroll, about 30 centimeters long. He had no idea that such a thing existed.

"Uh?"

Zhao Xu suddenly realized that an old wizard was slowly approaching him, accompanied by a middle-aged wizard with a respectful expression.

Zhao Xu was standing at the boundary between the front row and the back seats. He turned around to see if anyone was behind him, but there was no one.

It seemed like they were deliberately approaching him.

Could it be that they were going to ask him to leave?

The old wizard then realized that Anzhi Noya was just a novice wizard, and everything he had been told was just a ruse, including the gold coins that had appeared yesterday through a prayer. Just as Zhao Xu was daydreaming about the plot, he noticed that the old wizard was slowing down, but still getting closer, while Anzhi Noya remained completely unaffected.

There was no sign of respect or kindness towards the elderly.

Just then, the old wizard stopped about half a meter away from them. The novice wizards in the auditorium, even those with high pride, were all captivated by this scene.

"This old master is going to hold a ceremony for you all," the old wizard said, lowering his head and almost dropping his white beard.

"You can't just use a portal or teleportation to get here?" Anzhi Noya asked.

"This old master's magic is not something to be wasted on a short trip," the old wizard replied respectfully.

"Ah, get on with it then, I'm in a hurry," the old wizard said, while his eyes, which seemed to flash with brilliance, were fixed on Zhao Xu.
The translation is: "Young people, just go straight up to that 'Mysterious Throne' and sit down."
