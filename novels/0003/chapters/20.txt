Chapter 21: Transcription of Magical Arts

However, when Zhao Xu finally started learning those skills, he realized that he still thought it was too simple.

The entire game has many players, and the fastest record for graduating is seven days, which is not without reason.

It's like letting a middle school student directly self-study advanced mathematics. While it's not impossible, there will be difficulties.

The content learned in high school is not much compared to university, but they still repeated it for three years, so that they could intuitively respond to various forms of exam questions during the high school entrance examination.

The time for the exam is not enough for people to think deeply, so everyone advocates for the "topic ocean" tactic, using experience to compress thinking time.

Magical arts are the same.

Those models and various incantation postures require fusion with his instincts.

Zhao Xu has already known how to cast spells after a few days of learning, and most of the work is done in the hour of daily magical arts.

True casting is equivalent to the process of driving a car, and the magical arts themselves are like a vehicle that has already been built and is waiting there.

However, for this process, everyone still needs to exert themselves.

Magicians cannot just glance at the book and look at how to recite a spell when they are about to cast it. This will only make their opponents laugh.

Zhao Xu was also dizzy when looking at those various syllables of incantations.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The spellbook of our school of magic is written in arcane script, which is a common characteristic among all spellbooks. However, each spellbook is unique and requires individual processing. Therefore, I will give you a spellbook, and you will need to perform a 'spell recognition' check to unlock the true form of the spellbook. Only then can you read it."

"As I said, the spellbook is encrypted, and you need the key to decipher it. Spell recognition is one of the skills of the Arthurian Knights, similar to investigation and observation, which require practice and training."

"Zhao Xu hasn't reached the advanced level of spell recognition yet, so it's not applicable to him."

"It's because this 'zero-level magic book' is specifically designed to allow you to read the spellbook. Alternatively, if the owner of the spellbook allows it, you can also read it without going through the spell recognition process."

"Through the 'reading magic' spell, we can also read spellbooks set by others without traps. This spell is like a universal key."

"So, the arcane script is not intentionally encrypted by the school of magic, but rather it's the complexity of the script that makes it difficult for outsiders to decipher. Therefore, the school of magic has developed a method to break the spell."

"In other words, it's to prevent outsiders from accessing our secrets. However, you should remember that the spellbook is the foundation of each spellcaster, except for the 'reading magic' spell, which allows you to prepare spells without a spellbook. For any other spell, you need a spellbook to prepare and cast the spell."

Anzhi said this slowly and seriously.

Zhao Xu had heard that spellcasters often transcribed spells and went bankrupt, which sparked his curiosity. "Teacher, what is the cost of transcribing spells?" he asked.

Anzhi then handed Zhao Xu a book.
Here is the translation of the text:

After receiving it, Zhao Xu directly opened it and took a look. Although the cover of the book was thick and made of high-quality material, the book was completely blank. He estimated that it had about 100 pages, but since it was made of sheepskin paper, it looked quite thick.

He looked at An Niya with a puzzled expression, unsure of what to make of this.

"When you spend an entire day studying a spell, you can record it in your own spellbook. The number of pages you need to record depends on the level of the spell. For example, a zero-level spell requires one page, while a nine-level spell requires 11 pages."

Zhao Xu frowned at the thought of spending a whole day studying each spell. Moreover, the cost of recording each page was 100 gold pieces. However, the new mages were fortunate, as the association would cover the cost of recording their zero-level spells and three first-level spells.

Zhao Xu was shocked by the price, but he didn't expect it to be this expensive.

"Who is this money going to?"

"Not a single person gets this money. It's just a waste of materials. The cost of recording a 100-page spellbook is around 10,000 gold pieces, so we've recognized 100 gold pieces per page. You can't possibly record spells without spending this kind of money and yet still have the spells available for use."

Zhao Xu could only sigh at the thought of how poor and miserable mages are.

It's no wonder that no one has ever thought of printing spellbooks before. How could someone with limited resources afford to spend so much money?
Here is the translation:

Through the art of memory or copying from scrolls, it's like this. If you directly copy someone else's spellbook, since it's for reference, the time and copying fee will be halved, at 50GP per page, which is a calculated result.

Zhao Xu suddenly woke up with a burst of energy upon hearing this.

He didn't need to guess; he could sense that Anniya's expression under her cloak was certainly a smiling one, waiting for him to make a joke.

He himself watched a web series and had to pay a membership fee.

This fellow who eats, if someone lends you a book, even if the time is halved, it means he can't prepare the spells in that book.

Copying your own spellbook is also 50GP per page, unless it's absolutely necessary, no one will do something so boring.

Anniya didn't drag on for too long and gave him a direct explanation: "The current fee for borrowing spellbooks is calculated at 50GP per level. Some rare spells may require additional payment or not be disclosed."

Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu nodded, and the borrowing fee was just equal to the cost saved by copying the spellbook.

In other words, for a person to borrow a spellbook and copy spells, the cost is 100GP per level.

"So, now you have to choose two paths."

"'The first path is the book in my hand,'" she said, pulling out a book with an iron-bound cover, silver-edged lock, and approximately 30CM x 15CM in size, 15CM thick, and flying into his hand.

"This is the Goddess's Blessing Book, a rare item. Since it was made with spiritual essence, you don't need to pay for copying materials. The book contains 1000 pages and is priced at 12500GP, but it's relatively hard to buy because wizards all want it."

Looking at the ordinary-looking cover, Zhao Xu couldn't believe that there was such a divine item that could compress the copying price to nearly one-tenth.
Here is the translation of the text:

As long as there is such a rare item, the cost of recording materials per page can be reduced to 12.5 GP, which is much more advantageous than the original 100 GP or the 50 GP of the copying spellbook.

As for the difficult-to-buy, it's because outsiders don't have easy access to such a large organization, so they naturally have an internal purchase channel.
This is probably what everyone calls a privilege.

However, Zhao Xu didn't get too excited at this time, because he noticed that Anzhiya mentioned two paths.
"One path is to activate the 'Wise Heart' expertise."
"After this, all your spells will be recorded in your own mind, and you will no longer need spellbooks."
Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat at this time, and he began to take the path of the mage, and the strong expertise of this organization finally beckoned to him.
