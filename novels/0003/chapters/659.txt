Chapter 660: Magic Attack and Defense!

It's strange that someone would deliberately avoid a sneak attack, not to mention a surprise attack in the middle of a fight. Instead, they would explain everything beforehand and only then take action. Even in the blink of an eye, Zhao Xu's mind would whirl with countless thoughts, pondering whether the opponent's mental state was about to deteriorate.

After his intelligence had increased, he found that his thinking became even more swift and unobstructed. At critical moments, he could still remain calm and clear-minded, unraveling the threads of the universe.

Thinking about the strange aspects of this ancient fortress, Zhao Xu grew more suspicious. This "procedure" was likely a part of the ritual that the opponent had to complete to appease the "demonic god".

Zhao Xu's gaze was fixed intently on the opponent's "magic staff", which emitted a flashing gemstone at its tip. The staff itself seemed to be made of pure wood, with no visible carvings. However, Zhao Xu quickly realized that it was actually a "powerful magic staff".

As long as he consumed a certain amount of magical energy, he could cast ten different spells, including magic missiles, weakening rays, and monster binding spells (ranked from five to six). The staff's aura was radiating, indicating that the opponent had activated the staff's magic.

This caught Zhao Xu's attention, and he focused his eyes on the opponent's body, scanning him thoroughly. This deformed man might have received the protection of the "Cthulhu" demonic god, directly shielding his "secret vision" and making it impossible to detect any specific details.
Here is the translation:

As Zhao Xu had already carefully examined the opponent's magical items, he knew that they would not exceed three or four, and the staff worth 210,000 gold coins in his hand was the most valuable, surpassing the rest. However, as he thought, the glow within the staff did not fade away, but instead grew brighter and took shape.

In the blink of an eye, the spell was sure to be released. At this moment, Zhao Xu took a deep breath and waved his hand, releasing the "Storage Ring" on his finger, unleashing the strongest technique of the Eight Rings!

"Higher Speed Burst!"

Intuitive action!

Zhao Xu knew that he would be slower in casting spells from now on, but he had already taken the initiative. At the same time, the magical creature "Dream" on his shoulder, who was bound to the "Starlight Cloak", used its ability "Prayer" to release a healing spell that could restore 1 HP, activating the "Medicine Knowledge" spell's "Recovery Dizziness" effect.

This set of actions had become second nature to him, but this time, under the pressure of the situation, Zhao Xu re-evaluated his actions.

It was undeniable that, until he fully released the spell without being interrupted by the opponent's intuitive spell or affected by the special backlash of this space, Zhao Xu's heart remained heavy with anxiety.

A novice mage, he had always been feared for his unknown abilities, even more terrifying than a nightmare.

At this moment, with 6 seconds of time to spare, Zhao Xu could cast two spells, including a "Tag" and a "Quick" spell. He now realized the true difficulty of his situation.

The alchemist, who could enjoy the same reputation as the "Terrible" title, even earned a nod of approval from his mentor, Anniya. It was natural to have his own unique advantages.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a chemomancer, each level up can enhance their magical abilities, which is already impressive. Moreover, each level up also comes with professional skills. However, this leveling up and Zhao Xu's "Super Magical Transformation" are similar in that they can master the strongest and most tyrannical ability at the first level. Zhao Xu's "Super Magical Transformation" is a temporary ability that sacrifices attribute damage for "Super Magical Control". On the other hand, chemomancers can greatly increase the difficulty of spellcasting by using "Pollution Spellcasting". These spells are accompanied by the original polluting power, making them more difficult to resist. Generally, spellcasters need to rely on key attributes to determine the difficulty of spellcasting. For example, Zhao Xu's wizard relies on intelligence, while clerics and paladins rely on perception. The difficulty of spellcasting is calculated as 10 + ring number + key attribute adjustment value. Based on Zhao Xu's current 29 intelligence, even if he casts a five-ring spell, the difficulty would only be 24. Therefore, Zhao Xu's previous learning of "Spellcasting Upgrade" was only focused on "ring number". Because simple attribute enhancement is too difficult. Even a 20-level Zhao Xu would only gain three attribute points, increasing his intelligence from 29 to 32. However, a chemomancer's difficulty of spellcasting does not rely on intelligence, but on corruption value. A spellcaster with a corruption value of 50+ is equivalent to a 25 intelligence adjustment, which is at least 60 intelligence. A five-ring spell difficulty would then be 10 + 5 + 25 = 40.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Assuming that Zhao Xu's current physical condition is 29, controlling his "corrosion value" at a safe level of 80+, he still has a 30-point distance from death. At this time, the difficulty of his five-ring magic immunity is even higher, reaching 55 levels.

Not to mention, the extra spells of the pollutant chemist will depend on a 10+ corruption value, rather than intelligence. When determining extra spells, even a 40+ corruption value is equivalent to a 50-intelligence mage. At this stage, the reward spell slots are even more numerous than the original profession's spell slots.

As long as he has a 50+ corruption value and corruption value, he can already elevate the entire mage's strength to the extreme. From that moment on, numerous spells that were previously unable to enter the realm of the gods due to low immunity difficulty, such as "Death Finger", will begin to emerge.

Even Zhao Xu's "Incantation Guardian" can only ignore spell resistance, but immunity is still a considerable challenge. In essence, the pollutant chemist's ability to create spells with a difficulty of dozens of levels is what truly turns ordinary spells into treasures.

Moreover, the required combination factors are extremely low! Even a mage with no magical background can still rely on this ability to create miracles.

Even a pollutant chemist only needs to combine spells, and a mage from the countryside can still create miracles with this ability. The pollutant chemist only needs to consider suppressing his own corruption value and avoiding reaching the upper limit too quickly.

Additionally, the pollutant chemist can also obtain "secret" abilities at odd levels, including one secret ability - "Fresh Blood Super Magic".
Here is the translation:

It is a weakened version of Zhao Xu's "Supreme Magic Control", requiring no higher circles to cast. The difference is that it can only apply one supreme magic specialty, causing pinpoint physical damage, and cannot strengthen beyond the highest circle of magic that can be cast.

Despite being weakened to such an extent, it is still an "excellent ability" that cannot be compromised. After reviewing the strong abilities of the pollutochemist in just 1 second, Zhao Xu's inner heart became even more cautious.

This means that the spellcaster in front of him has the possibility of a "one-hit kill"!

Even a weak spell in the hands of the pollutochemist is a terrifying means. The pollutochemist's own spells are considered "evil" components, making it easier to increase the spellcaster's level and break through the magical resistance.

For example, Zhao Xu's "Skull Saint Seal" allows the necromancy spell to increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and enhance the "Domain of Decline" effect.

Deep breath!

Even though Zhao Xu's "Higher Speed Burst" can greatly slow down time, Zhao Xu still clearly sensed the opponent's magic staff shining brightly.

He gritted his teeth and glanced at the character panel on the person's face.

Constitution: 38 levels (9 profession + 8 physique + 5 resistance + 5 morale + 1 performance + 10 luck)
Reflex: 33 levels (3 profession + 8 agility + 5 resistance + 5 morale + 1 performance + 10 luck + 1 quickness boost)
Willpower: 38 levels (13 profession + 4 perception + 5 resistance + 5 morale + 1 performance + 10 luck)
Here is the translation of the text:

Mental state: One-Ring Belief, Resistance: Sage's Robe, Performance: Ayn Stone, Fortune: Treasure of the Explorer's Legacy

Even if those monsters approaching legendary level are far inferior to Zhao Xu's current level of resistance!

Facing the daunting task of a 50-level mage with a high degree of difficulty in casting spells, Zhao Xu still lacks the confidence to take on the challenge!

Do you know that a 20-level mage's basic qualities, such as 6 levels of strength, 6 levels of reflexes, and 12 levels of willpower, are far inferior to Zhao Xu's current abilities!

With dual elite skills, good fortune, and frequent overtime work, Zhao Xu's abilities are not inferior to those of a 20-level mage!

Attack?
Defense?
The scales of justice are constantly spinning in Zhao Xu's mind, forcing him to ponder the strategy he should adopt against such a formidable mage.

Undeniably, Zhao Xu and his opponent both have the possibility of a one-hit kill.

However, it is difficult for Zhao Xu to rule out the possibility that his opponent has a trump card, which could lead to a passive defeat if he fails to anticipate it.

No!
Zhao Xu's mind suddenly clears, realizing that the reputation of the opponent's name has caused him too much pressure!

The opponent's ability to pollute the spell is not feasible for a wizard.

No!
Zhao Xu instantly denies this possibility.

At this moment, the opponent has not yet completed the spell, and unless he prepares an action to counterattack, he cannot eliminate the possibility of a fake spell.

Especially, this deformed mage has clearly understood the opponent's secrets and may have considered this aspect, deliberately pretending to cast a spell.

Ultimately, Zhao Xu lets his guard down, thinking that the opponent does not have the "pollution" effect, and then uses an attack spell, only to be counterattacked and killed.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this moment, Zhao Xu's mind was like countless rings entwining each other, each pushing and pulling the possibilities of the other.

Oh well!

In the end, the thought process that did not gamble with one's life still emerged victorious!

"Mercy of the Martyr!"

As Zhao Xu let out a loud shout and struck a pose with his hands clasped together, the sacred creed he invoked began to descend from the heavens, pouring into his entire body.

The halo of honor and glory immediately enveloped his entire physical body, instilling in him an unshakeable conviction to counter fear.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have cast the "Mercy of the Martyr" skill, granting you the following effects for the next 33 minutes:

Immunity to bleeding, charm, coercion, and any effects that cause pain.
Immunity to effects such as dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation.
】

With this, Zhao Xu has basically immunized himself against a multitude of negative effects.

At this moment, the "Higher Quick Release" has only just begun, and he still has an opportunity to use the "Quick Action" skill!

Zhao Xu, without hesitation, brandished his "Higher Super Magic Wand" - releasing "Defensive Barrier"!

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, you have cast the "Defensive Barrier" skill, granting you immunity to all death spells, magical death effects, energy absorption, and other negative energy effects for the next 33 minutes.

Immunity is the strongest defense.

Zhao Xu doesn't even want to engage in a spell-casting competition with the opponent, let alone try to outmaneuver him.

He directly filled in his last weak spot!

Most negative buffs have been filled in by Zhao Xu in this instant.

Even the opponent has to try to figure out what he has not immunized against.
Here is the translation:

As the protective barrier's positive energy ring enveloped Zhao Xu's entire body, the extra time brought about by the higher speed explosion was exhausted in this instant. Suddenly, the dark mage on the opposite side brandished their staff, and a brilliant light burst forth!

Is that a powerful spell stored within the staff?

"Invalidation of Spell!"

A faintly glowing, fixed magical sphere appeared, directly enveloping the distorted man opposite. This six-ring arcane art could shield all spells from one to four rings!

If Zhao Xu had not yet reached the five-ring level at this moment, seeing this spell would have made him extremely frustrated, as he had an innate ability to suppress all effects below the four-ring level.

This was a common tactic used by high-level mages to bully low-level mages.

Recalling the time Zhao Xu faced the endless barrage of arcane cannons, he relied on the secondary invalidation spell within his protective staff to defend himself.

Who would have thought that the dark mage in front of him, with powerful magical attacks, would also choose to defend themselves?

Zhao Xu felt a sense of despair and could only shake his head and smile wryly, realizing he had underestimated his opponent.

A mage who could withstand the numerous concurrent corruption symptoms within the ancient stronghold, his desire for survival was extremely strong! How could he bear to rashly engage in a life-or-death battle with someone?

Just like Zhao Xu, who had an endless number of hidden cards, he wouldn't rashly engage in a battle with a stranger.

At this moment, Zhao Xu also restored his internal magical fluctuations and continued to elevate his authority, pointing his staff at the opponent from afar.

The dark mist enveloping the opponent's body made it difficult for him to discern the finer details, otherwise, he wouldn't have been so frustrated at the beginning of the attack.
Since it is so, let's first throw a stone to ask the way. The magical technique of dual birth, feeble wisdom!
