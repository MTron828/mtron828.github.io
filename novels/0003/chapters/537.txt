Chapter 538: The First Player's Loss

After the "Chimera" trained militiamen were killed and converted into undead creatures by Zhao Xu and his team, and brought back, Zhao Xu's personal reputation soared to new heights.

The legend of the wizards has become even more terrifying to the residents of these small towns, which is just an illusion.

It's only when someone puts their strength on full display that people can understand the crushing momentum.

Even if players try to challenge Zhao Xu again, it's like trying to attack a mountain, and they might even be wiped out.

Players who are familiar with Zhao Xu's abilities realize that he has a "White Dragon" pet and his strength is unmatched.

After establishing the "Lord's Office" department in the city hall, Zhao Xu posted his announcement on the notice board outside the city hall, which is also where the town announcements and policies are posted.

Zhao Xu's first announcement clearly stated that the player "Allow Pastor" discovered the Chimera nest with the help of divine power and received a "+5 Insight" inner value "Comprehensive Volume" related to the priest's main attribute.

Strictly speaking, a war priest may have a higher demand for strength than insight, especially since war priests are expanding their abilities in close combat and "Divine Blessing" and "War Domain" directions.

Among players, there are also 16 strength and 14 insight war priest starting strategies.

Generally, spellcasters have stopped pursuing the extreme 18-point main attribute as they did at the start of the game.
Here is the translation of the text:

According to their perception, only a few players can execute the Five Rings Divine Art. It's also because people realize that the Five Rings are too far away, and it's better to focus on the present. When it's necessary, they can upgrade their equipment and attribute points later.

Meanwhile, warriors found themselves in an awkward situation, unable to find a single cleric who can heal them. As a result, barbarians had to rely on their fierce fighting spirit to regain some face.

As for the announcement made by Zhao Xu, stating that a 1st-level cleric obtained an item worth 100,000 gold coins, although it raised some suspicions, Zheng Xin's participation as a kind-hearted cleric greatly increased the credibility of the announcement.

It is undeniable that becoming a cleric requires adherence to the principles of the camp and the will of the gods. This point has been generally accepted by players.

It's not that players don't understand the role of a cleric, which can deal damage and heal. Rather, it's that they cannot fulfill the role.

Faith and discipline are intertwined and are the greatest obstacles. A warrior may try to deceive and manipulate others, but his sword will remain sharp. However, a cleric who betrays their faith and principles will see their divine art lose its luster.

Therefore, Zhao Xu's "task" has indeed been "verified", and the value of this task, which is worth over 100,000 gold coins, far exceeds the difficulty of finding a nest. This has greatly stimulated the adventure team.

Furthermore, the team also obtained some valuable information about unregistered nest locations, without wasting their time.

As a result, everyone has been closely monitoring the announcement board, with all information related to the Lord's Manor.

In the following feedback, players have also subtly regarded "Zhong Xia" as a game NPC, or even a god who has transcended their player status.
As spring arrives, the construction of the "Mage Association's Base" in the small town is gaining momentum, with the completion of the rooftop imminent, awaiting the arrival of subsequent mages and artisans from the capital.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu has been quietly cultivating his own abilities, occasionally participating in the actions of other players. Most of his acquaintances from his previous life have had some interaction with him after his rebirth.

He is like a seasoned adventurer who, after years of wandering, wakes up one morning to see dewdrops on the windowsill and suddenly understands the importance of returning to his hometown and restoring his peaceful life.

During this period, players who have obtained experience by trading revival stones have begun to successfully breakthrough to new levels. Zhao Xu's 8th-level identity no longer seems as impressive.

At the same time, with the increase in divine blessings from the gods, messages of adventurers receiving divine blessings have occasionally emerged on the forum.

As early as a few days ago, there was a rumor about a half-human player who had obtained the blessing of the war god while hunting a group of 6th-level dragons and almost broke through to 8th level.

By the time the server reached its sixth month, there were already over 300 players who had reached level 7.

Among them, the top 20 players who reached level 7 earliest have the potential to break through to level 8 at any time.

Clerics and mages, who are considered top-tier professions, have already begun to appear at level 6.

The "Fireball" spell, a three-ring spell, has also begun to shine in the hands of top-tier mages.

Although it may not be able to cause absolute damage to players of the same level as warriors and barbarians, it is sufficient to clear low-level monsters and 1-2 level players.

This is the first time that players have felt a sense of "fun" in the game.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's finally possible to experience the thrill of killing monsters in traditional online games.

At this moment, everyone has begun to realize that these top players are just one step away from the legendary players, who are considered to be on a different level.

They are no longer struggling to catch up to their opponents, avoiding the triggering of the jump gap treaty.

Instead, the top 20 players in the near-combat class can easily reach the level of the legendary players.

Even if the opponent breaks through to level 9, they cannot trigger the jump gap again.

Players can finally regain their dignity.

However, Xiaoyue spends most of his time on the construction site of the guild, between the Star Lake and the mining area, and only goes out to hunt monsters once a week.

Sometimes, he sits on a small boat on the lake, fishing for the whole afternoon.

Or he holds a thick book with intricate designs and reads it on the boat, with the women on the boat occasionally changing.

It's as if he has turned "Arthur" into a game of nurturing life.

The situation of Zhao Xiu, who has not leveled up for two months, is completely different from the one who leveled up 2 levels in a month, 8 levels in four months, and crushed the second-ranked player by 3 levels.

If Zhao Xiu occasionally takes action, he can use the four-ring spell to crush and shock everyone, otherwise, there will be a backlash of voices even in the town.

Most players are pitiful.

Especially since the opening of the "American server", "Asian server", and "European server", foreign players have joined Arthur, making this anxiety even more intense.

Although players from other servers are mostly born outside the current national server's common town.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhaoxu's decision to take a two-month-long break from his 8th-grade studies has caused people to worry about whether the scenery of the 9th grade is as insurmountable as a heavenly barrier.

"Mr. Zhongxia, you seem to be very leisurely."

Zheng Xin allowed himself to row the small boat with all his might, pushing the waves back and slowly drifting on the lake under the setting sun, like a dream.

From an outsider's perspective, Zhaoxu didn't seem to do any physical labor, just holding his hands and reading a book, while Zheng Xin, a woman, rowed the boat. Even if the other person was a 12th-grade pastor, it was somewhat ungentlemanly.

"Don't you feel annoyed?" Zhaoxu joked.

Zheng Xin slightly puffed out his mouth, but didn't say a word.

"I'm just telling you that, although the gods are largely products of faith and priestly character, many people's original hearts have been worn down, but they still cannot deny that they will make deals," Zhaoxu said, looking at Zheng Xin.

"As long as I value the gods more than you do, they will rely on me," Zhaoxu added.

Zhaoxu thought to himself.

Zheng Xin, on the other hand, was holding his breath, rowing the boat with all his might, and muttering to himself.

"I knew that Mr. Zhongxia would definitely scold his wife soon," he said.

"Haha, haha, haha," Zhaoxu suddenly burst out laughing, feeling a sense of relief.

Zheng Xin, however, looked at Zhaoxu with a strange expression, saying, "But Mr. Zhongxia, you seem to be quite enthusiastic."

It is clear that Zheng Xin, who had been fully immersed in his missionary work, had slowly risen to the 3rd level over the past two months.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but burst out laughing when he saw the scene. Zheng Xin Yu, who had been preaching to his followers, had accumulated a lot of spiritual power. Zhao Xu had almost no money and returned all the spiritual power to Zheng Xin Yu.

Otherwise, how could he have risen to level 3 so quickly?

As a result, he was actually scolded by Zheng Xin Yu.

Zhao Xu, still smiling, said, "What's wrong? You're not satisfied with the 50-golden-coin boat that's not luxurious enough?"

"You can invite me to a bigger boat if you have such refinement," Zheng Xin Yu said.

Zheng Xin Yu's eyebrows furrowed, and he said, "Sir Arthur, I'm only reminding you of this because of what Condor Sister and I said. You've ordered a three-masted frigate worth 30,000 gold coins from the shipyard in the capital city. Sir Arthur, are you planning to start a trade around the Eternal River?"

Many players had already realized that they didn't need to level up to engage in corresponding industries on the planet. The old-established trade routes were thriving in the player community.

A few giant trading companies had emerged, and even interacted with the power elite in the towns, monopolizing part of the trade in goods.

Zheng Xin Yu thought Zhao Xu had shifted his focus from purchasing magical equipment to boost his own strength, and had various doubts.

He thought Zhao Xu also wanted to earn the "easy money" on the planet.

Unbeknownst to Zheng Xin Yu, Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "The three-masted frigate is almost 40 meters long and 5 meters wide. In addition to the three masts, each side of the ship has 70 oar positions. A total of 200 sailors are needed, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. Don't you think this ship is a good deal?"

In reality, Zheng Xin Yu didn't know that Zhao Xu had paid an additional 8,000 gold coins to modify the ship, adding a ram and installing three turrets on the front, middle, and rear.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A man's dreams are all vast oceans," Zhào Xu joked.

"Hmph, don't think I don't know that this ship can't cross the ocean, it can only sail along the coast or row," Zhèng Xīnyù corrected.

This means that this ship can only sail along the eternal winter river that flows through the entire northern region.

Zhào Xu suddenly felt that Zheng Xinyu's words were clever and had done their homework before bringing it up.

This shows that the other party's opinion is not just Zheng Xinyu's idea, but may represent the views of many people.

Zhào Xu couldn't explain it, but he was preparing food on one side and preparing sufficient manpower for deployment on the other.

The eternal winter river that flows through the entire northern region can reach the "Wasteland" that appears after crossing, which is where the Earthlings are.

As long as a port is built there, it can receive continuous supplies from the entire northern region.

Of course, the prerequisite is that there is enough money.

So Zhào Xu had arranged people to go to some shipyards to buy large sailing ships.

"Squawk --"

Suddenly, a sharp, piercing whistle sound came from the lake shore.

When players discovered that Earthling actions could be perfectly replicated after mastering the whistle technique, many players who couldn't whistle before began to master this skill with more agile fingers.

Zhào Xu looked at Zheng Xinyu's furrowed brow and gazed into the distance, realizing that a group of unfamiliar players had noticed their actions on the lake and were blowing whistles from afar.

"It's the Spring Outing Team," Zhào Xu quickly confirmed the identity of the group's leader by glancing at the flag.

"Not taking things to heart," Zheng Xinyu murmured to herself.
Here is the translation:

As the highway from the Winter City arrived, the vanguard of the road was a group of seven or eight warriors dressed in full armor. It's no exaggeration to say that anyone who can equip such gear is one of the top players. For ordinary civilians, it's like being trapped in a can, unable to take a step forward. This is also the reason why knights in armor were considered nobles in the Middle Ages.

Behind these bodyguards stood a group of adventurers, including a ranger, a priest, and a rogue, each of whom was an expert in their field. Together, they formed a team of ten people who escorted a group of nearly 50 people, known as the "sightseeing party."

As King Arthur's fame spread, many players who had difficulty completing training courses began to focus on the game's scenery. These players were known as the "golden coin sightseeing party."

As long as they had the money, these adventurers were willing to take their sightseeing party to the lair of the giant dragon and enjoy a day of sightseeing. Because this group of sightseers were mostly 18 constitution, with a bonus to vitality (+3 life value), they were willing to take risks to see the wonders of the Arthurian kingdom.

Therefore, they were not afraid to provoke stronger players. Even if they lost, they could just register a new account and start again.

Zheng Xin allowed knew this point, so she understood that these sightseers were unwavering. "He's going to regret it if he does it again," she said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu continued to flip through the book in his hand, "Mistral's Magic Guardian: A Secret History of Blood and Fire." However, his reaction was more stimulating to the sightseeing party, which had just started to get excited. The oily men in the group burst out laughing.
Suddenly, the person next to him hastily pulled him, saying, "Don't die, the leader of this small town might be someone else." "Oh, is it that first player who has already lost?" the man who had just blown his whistle laughed jokingly.
