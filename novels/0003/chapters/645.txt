Chapter 646: The Oath of Magic

At this moment, the goddess of magic emanated a sacred and resplendent glow from within the light and shadows, like the rising sun. Any evil person who approached would feel an unbearable pain. The red mist slowly emerged from the door, forming a circle with seven blue and white stars, and the eyes of the Heavenly Gate seemed to gaze upon this region.

The goddess's pressure caused everyone present to kneel down, bowing their heads to the ground, trembling under the weight of this divine will. The goddess's power was like the sea, her authority like a prison.

Even the most resolute unbeliever would feel a sense of weakness and vulnerability in the face of the divine will. Zhao Xu was the only one who could maintain his composure, standing firm and unwavering like a flagpole in a storm.

As for the other players, they were silently repeating the titles in their minds: "Mysterious Lady, Mother of All Magic, Source of All Arcana, Holy Mother of All Creation."

At this moment, Xisilvina had jet-black flowing hair and skin that was taut and radiant, a perfect representation of the ideal human female form. She was wearing a simple yet elegant deep-colored silk dress, with a gemstone pendant around her neck.

Zhao Xu had already realized that the woman standing before him was likely a manifestation of Xisilvina. He had recognized the ring on her chest - the core of the highest permission in Arthur's magical network.
Here is the translation:

As long as one possesses it, all the legendary beings and magic that have appeared on the continent of Arthur will be able to perfectly replicate and be used. However, the true goddess of magic doesn't need such a method. Or, any true god cannot show their true form on this land of Arthur. To send an avatar is already the greatest scale.

"Respectfully, Goddess," said Zhao Xu as he slightly bowed his head.

He had not forgotten that he was the other party's priest, a "scholar-priest" who specialized in knowledge.

Although Zhao Xu was no longer like other devout goddess priests who would pray and worship at dawn and dusk, he still maintained the basic rituals for the goddess.

"I'm also happy to see you again, Xunyue," said the goddess Sylviana's soft voice, making the people below feel their hearts stir with emotion.

This was a true goddess, one of the strongest divine powers in Arthur!

It was as if they had known each other for a long time.

This familiar conversation even made them think that another powerful divine power was standing in the scene.

Even before crossing over, gods were like distant stars that could be observed but not touched for mortals.

"I think Nydia should have mentioned it to you," said the goddess, her voice softening. "The effect of the three divine miracles I gave you. Do you decide to use it to revive her for the last time?"

"Or use it to save your kingdom?"

As she spoke, the goddess's avatar slightly lifted her hand with the white silk sleeve edge, as if indicating something to him.

"You can use it to save these innocent civilians who are about to be ravaged by the rain, isn't that a better choice?"

Zhao Xu slightly lowered his head and spoke slowly.

"It's not that simple to me."
Here is the translation of the text:

As he spoke, his eyes gleamed with intensity, and he lifted his head to gaze at the goddess, saying, "When I first registered my character, I climbed the ladder at that time."

"At that time, I answered over a thousand questions, and in the profession icons ahead, the priests and mages were all clear, but the druid's icon was nowhere to be seen."

Suddenly, the players kneeling behind him couldn't help but shout out in surprise, for they too had registered characters before and had never answered over a thousand questions.

Ordinary people wouldn't have the patience to answer so many questions, let alone those with strong convictions. Unless one has obsessive-compulsive disorder, it's unlikely that someone would continue answering questions without being able to extinguish the icon's glow.

As the crowd looked at Zhongxiao's gaze, it became different, and they were deeply curious about the first person's story.

"It wasn't until I encountered a question about moral dilemmas that I was able to remove the druid's icon, and thus I obtained the two profession badges of mage and priest."

As soon as he finished speaking, many players who knew the inside story were also shaken, wondering if Zhongxiao really had a priest-level profession, just like the legend said.

Wasn't he completing his second profession training?

"Can you still remember that question?" Goddess Sylvia suddenly asked.

Zhaoxu nodded with a smile, saying, "Of course."

"One track has five children playing, while another abandoned track has only one child. A distant train is about to arrive and will crush the five playing children. At this fork in the road, I'm holding a handle that can change the tracks, and I have to choose between saving one rule-abiding child or five unruly children."

Zhaoxu recounted the previous question, and even now, he still couldn't forget the shock and excitement of that time.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When did you choose?" the goddess, transformed into a curious being, asked.

The players below, including ordinary citizens, leaned in to listen, and even players who had just arrived from outside the region and camp administrators were gathering. The gods' majesty was such that no explanation was needed, and they immediately fell to their knees in unison.

As for those who heard this question, they all tilted their heads, thinking about how they would make their choice.

"I refuse to answer," Zhao Xu said.

"Ah?"

"How can I not?"

"Can it be that I won't answer?"

At that moment, the players who had scaled the heavens together all discussed the issue, and some even chose the statue directly without answering. Even those who patiently answered the question would skip this step when registering their characters again.

Although the memory was long ago, everyone clearly remembered that only by answering could they continue to the next question.

"You haven't answered?"

"No," Zhao Xu shook his head, "I directly told the broken ladder that I refused to answer this low-level question."

At that moment, the crowd below all looked surprised.

However, looking at it from a different angle, it became clear that making this decision was not easy.

Because Zhao Xu's choice was like giving up.

The first hundred times of giving up was tolerable.

But the cost of giving up on the first thousand times was enough to shake anyone's determination.

"Why?" the goddess, now with a smile, gazed at Zhao Xu, who stood on the scorched earth with a fiery spirit.

"Because this should not have been a question at all."
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu shook his head and said, "If I choose to save those five children, the next question would be that I have to kill one of them to save the other five."

"If I refuse this time, or if I had chosen to sacrifice those five children from the very beginning, then the scale would tip to the other side, with a hundred children, a thousand, or even a billion, or all of humanity."

"If you choose to save more people based on the number, then what is the number?"

"So I tell you, I refuse to answer such a stupid question."

At this moment, Zhao Xu's words struck directly at the heart of the problem.

This kind of moral dilemma should not even be a question. Even if the next step is to ask parents to sacrifice one of their own children, how would they face it?

"Haha." The goddess, who had been maintaining a composed demeanor, suddenly burst out laughing with an unparalleled smile.

Because Zhao Xu had, in an intangible way, answered the goddess's question, as well as the questions of everyone who followed.

If he chose to use "divine power" to save all the people in the land of Yana this time, then what would happen if he encountered a situation where he had to sacrifice the entire land to save 6 billion people next time? Should he follow the principle of maximizing benefits to save more people?

"Now it's your turn to answer this question. How would you answer it?" the goddess asked, her tone becoming even more gentle and soothing, as if listening to a lullaby.

Zhao Xu also had a flash of inspiration and immediately declared, "I'll turn over the chessboard."

"Very good." The magic goddess Sisylva lightly clapped her hands and looked directly at Zhao Xu, saying, "Zhao Xu, you were asked by Naiya whether you were willing to become my elector, a magic executor in the Arthurian realm."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I can also tell you as a citizen that you are not defending me, but the magic itself."
"As for us, we are only temporarily exercising the power of magic."
As she spoke with a solemn tone, the heavenly gate behind her began to resonate with a melody that transcended the mortal realm, echoing with the sacred song of the heavenly spirits.

"I, Silviana, the embodiment of magic in the world, am asking you, Zhongxia, if you understand——"
"Magic is an art beyond compare, a gift bestowed by fate, and the highest privilege given by Arthur to those who wield it. Always remember to remain humble and avoid arrogance. To master magic effectively, one must avoid recklessness and carelessness. If magic puts you in a precarious situation, you should be able to extricate yourself. Only by following this path can you avoid the sin of abusing magic."

"We are devoted to magic itself, not using it as a tool to overthrow the world. When you learn not to use magic, you will truly understand wisdom. Use magic at the most opportune moment, not for selfish gain. A truly powerful mage is one who can control their desire for magic. Wisdom and thought are the true power of magic."

"Learn new magic, create new magic. Self-study and creation surpass following ancient tomes and seeking guidance. Create magic in creation, share it with others, and magic will never perish."

"In the end, the practitioner who has mastered magic will gain eternal wisdom, achieve an eternal will, and coexist with Arthur, pouring their heart and soul into the world, becoming one with magic."

Finally, Silviana gently placed her hand on Zhongxia's forehead, speaking softly.

"Will you become my citizen, Zhongxia?"
Zhongxia, however, clenched his fist and made a solemn oath.
"I swear here, I will defend magic until the day I die."

["The spellcaster, Solstice, has sworn an oath 'to defend magic until the day I die', for the second time."
