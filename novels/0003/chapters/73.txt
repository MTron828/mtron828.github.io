Chapter 74: The Power of Nature

"'Brother Maple Leaf, what's going on?' Yuyue looked around cautiously, only to find that the escorts of the merchant caravan were also quite anxious. 'Possibly there's an obstacle ahead, Yuyue, you should have used your divine arts to avoid it earlier,' Brother Maple Leaf began to arrange the positions of the other three team members."

"The players are not inexperienced, and they don't need to be told how to position themselves. After all, they've been through about a month's worth of basic combat training."

"Zhao Xu lightly opened his backpack and touched the mark on his back to confirm that it was still there, and then relaxed slightly."

"Annie Noa gave him three assassination skills, one of which was directly attached to his back. As long as he didn't use the revival stone, the remaining ones would become part of his reward."

"So every time Zhao Xu uses one, he's using up some of his future rewards. However, Zhao Xu is very confident that as long as he's not killed instantly, he can use the skill attached to his back to last at least 250 minutes and handle most situations."

"Zhao Xu's deepest impression of this mark is that Annie Noa sacrificed a legendary spell to directly accelerate the production time from 23 days to 23 minutes. This only accelerated the time, not the materials or expertise required for production."

"Annie Noa naturally didn't affect her physical condition, but Zhao Xu knew that his character would definitely be short-lived, with a lifespan of only 23 days. Thinking about being able to compete for eternal life in the future, he didn't care about this price. Otherwise, it would be too silly to wait for half a month for this mark."
"The great guardian of the forest, we have no intention of offending you. Please allow us to pass, this is the treasure we offer." At this moment, Ruya in front finally shouted.
His voice echoed around the entire forest, and several attendants quickly carried over prepared boxes.
"The forest guardian?" The wanderer asked in a low voice.
"It's a druid, I'm afraid there's a secret society of druids here. I only just found out their route, otherwise I would have been prepared earlier," the poet Antarctic frog sighed.
It's easy to take on one druid, but it's very troublesome to take on a group of druids. As the saying goes, in Arthur's world, all small druids are one family.
Even players who are not afraid of anything in the world dare not casually destroy the forest in Arthur's world.
"No, druids wouldn't just stop a caravan like this, is there something wrong with these goods?" Miss Priest said, looking straight at the carriage.
However, all the goods in this convoy have been tightly wrapped in oilcloth, with no ventilation at all.
"Could it be animal fur or tiger whip and bear gallbladder?" The wanderer Rainbow already had a bad association.
"No, don't think of these gangsters as fools. They know there are tigers in the mountains, why would they go there?" The poet frog denied.
Zhao Xu stayed in the corner, listening silently, but his opinion of this small team had increased by half.
Encountering something wrong, being able to analyze it rationally rather than panic, is also considered qualified.
At this moment, suddenly the entire forest erupted with the roar of a lion.
"It's the druid's animal companion," the wanderer Rainbow quickly said, having noticed the direction of the lion before Zhao Xu and the others, relying on his own reconnaissance and listening skills.
"What kind?" Zhao Xu quickly asked.
"Just a lion," the wanderer Rainbow was puzzled.
But at this point, Zhao Xu didn't need to ask any further.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire squad of merchants began to tremble, including the warrior-like players like Maple Leaf. However, it wasn't because they sensed something unusual ahead, but because the oak trees surrounding them, which were originally 10 meters tall, suddenly sprouted into towering tree people.

Everyone was paralyzed with fear, fearing that any unexpected noise would mark the start of a massacre. The oak tree people then began to wave their hands, animating the surrounding oak trees that were previously immobile.

Like a gentle breeze, the oak tree people suddenly multiplied, with their numbers swelling to around 40-50. This overwhelming pressure slowly seeped into the hearts of everyone present.

Zhao Xu, who had seen many battles, still managed to keep his composure, but he couldn't help but mutter to himself: "What's going on?"

However, he didn't even bother to make a knowledge check this time, and instead, he was lucky enough to stumble upon the content he had read about when his knowledge (nature) skill was boosted.

"Hey, poet, how can such a sudden and quiet emergence of an oak army be possible? If there's such a spell, wouldn't a simple flick of the wrist be enough to take down the players' army?" Zhao Xu said.

However, the poet's "逸闻知识" (legendary knowledge) failed to pass the check, and he didn't even have the knowledge (nature) skill to use. In this situation, he was powerless and could only remain silent.

"It's because they've been hiding there from the start," Zhao Xu explained.

The people around him suddenly turned their gaze towards him.

"How is this possible? I've upgraded my investigation skill to level 2, and with 2 points of perception adjustment, how could I, with a +4 investigation bonus, not notice such obvious tree people?" Rainbow, the wanderer, exclaimed in frustration.

"The tree people's hiding skill in the forest has a +16 racial bonus," Zhao Xu said calmly.
Even if the tree people themselves are hiding and their value is negative, when combined with racial bonuses, their skills in combat surpass those of wandering rookies like Rainbow. However, at this moment, Zhao Xu and the others were all attracted by what was in front of them. A druid riding a fierce lion emerged from the depths of the forest. Behind him, the jungle was even more shadowy, obviously not knowing how many people were lying in ambush.

The druid's face was ancient, as if it contained a raging fire underneath. The leather armor he wore was entwined with various vines, and the fierce lion under his knees bared its teeth.

"What level is the lion rider?" the warrior Maple Leaf asked, seeing the imposing figure.

At level 1, most druid players still ride horses or camels, nowhere near the level of a lion.

"It seems to be level 7," the priest said thoughtfully.

Zhao Xu glanced at the priest and smirked. This was the downside of relying on memory rather than skills.

He didn't want this group to underestimate the druid, and therefore underestimate the tree people in front of them. So he spoke again, "This is a fierce lion. At least a level 10 druid can have one."

Then he looked at the oak tree people around him and said, "These tree people are summoned using the level 6 druid spell 'Oak Guardian.' Each of them can summon two more of the same tree people. Don't underestimate them, this is a challenge level 8 monster."

As Zhao Xu spoke, the others may not have grasped the concept of the tree people, but when he mentioned a challenge level 8, the level 1 players understood.

The challenge level was a recommended combat level suggested by Arthur, meaning that to challenge this kind of monster, it was recommended to have at least 4 adventurers of level 8 or above.

Although the evaluation was not very accurate in the post-cataclysm era, the combat power of monsters at the same challenge level could vary greatly. However, it still had some reference value.
"Escape depending on the situation," whispered the soldier Maple.
Although the druid had not spoken yet, with this kind of starting posture, it was impossible to have a good conversation.
Intimidated by the druid's power in front of him, Roya continued to raise his voice, "Druid, please allow us to pass. I am willing to offer a sum of money to maintain nature, and I also promise—"
"Get lost!"
