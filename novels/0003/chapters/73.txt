Chapter 74: The Power of Nature
"Brother Maple Leaf, what's wrong?" Yu Yu looked around, only to find that the escort team's attendants were also very nervous.
"It's possible that we've encountered some obstacles ahead, Yu Yu, and you didn't use your divine magic to dodge them well." Warrior Maple Leaf began to arrange the positions of the other three team members.

The players didn't have much experience, but they weren't stupid either. After a month of time, they had basically acquired some basic combat knowledge and didn't need Zhao Xu to explain the positions.

Zhao Xu lightly opened his backpack and touched the mark on his back, reassuring himself that it was still there and slightly relaxing.

Anzhi Noya had given him three killer moves, one of which was attached directly to his back.

As soon as he encountered an unexpected event or started to use it, it would trigger.

These three killer moves would all become part of his reward if he didn't use the revive stone. So, Zhao Xu always used them in advance, sacrificing his future rewards.

However, Zhao Xu was very confident. As long as he wasn't killed instantly, he could use the killer move on his back and have at least 250 minutes to deal with most situations.

He remembered the deepest impression of this mark on his back, which was that Anzhi Noya had spent a legendary spell's price to directly accelerate the production process from 23 days to 23 minutes.

This only accelerated the time, not involving the materials and expertise required for production.

Since Anzhi Noya's body situation was locked, it naturally didn't affect him. But Zhao Xu knew that his role had definitely shortened his lifespan by 23 days.

Thinking about the possibility of eternal life in the future, he didn't care about this price. After all, it was too silly to wait for half a month for this mark.

"The Great Forest Guardian, we mean no disrespect, please allow us to pass through. This is the treasure we have brought." At this moment, the leader of the group, Lyra, finally spoke up.

Her voice echoed throughout the entire forest, and the few attendants quickly brought over the prepared boxes.

"What's this, the Forest Guardian?" the wanderer whispered.

"It's a Druid, I'm afraid there's a secret gathering of Druids here. I've only just learned of their route, or else we could have prepared earlier," the poet, Qing Xia, sighed.

It's easy to take on a single Druid, but taking on a group of them is a different story. As the saying goes, "even if you're not afraid of heaven or earth, you shouldn't be reckless in the forest of Arthur."

"But the Druids wouldn't suddenly block our path like this," the priestess said, looking straight at the cart.

However, all the goods on this cart have been tightly wrapped in oilcloth, not a single draft of air.

"Could it be animal fur or tiger gallbladder or something like that?" the wanderer, Rainbow, was already having bad thoughts.

"No, don't think these faction members are idiots. They must know that there are tigers on the mountain, yet they still come here," Qing Xia denied.

Zhao Xu stood in the corner, listening silently, but his evaluation of this small team had increased by half.

When something doesn't feel right, it's best to analyze it calmly rather than panicking. Suddenly, a loud roar of a lion echoed throughout the forest.

"It's the Druid's animal companion," the wanderer, Rainbow, exclaimed, having already noticed the direction of the lion through his own investigation skills.

"What kind?" Zhao Xu asked hastily.

"Just a lion," Rainbow replied, puzzled.

However, Zhao Xu didn't need to ask anymore at this point.
Here is the translation of the text:

The entire team of merchants and followers began to tremble, even the warrior player like Maple Leaf couldn't help but gasp for air.

It wasn't that something unusual appeared ahead, but rather that the oak trees around them, which were originally 10 meters tall, suddenly sprang to life and became giant tree people.

Everyone was too afraid to move, fearing that any sudden noise would trigger a massacre.

Next, the oak tree people began to wave their hands, activating the surrounding motionless oak trees.

Like a silk thread breaking, the oak tree people suddenly flipped over twice, with the number of tree people quickly reaching 40-50.

The pressure of this massive number was slowly seeping into everyone's minds.

Zhao Xu, who had seen many scenes, was still able to maintain his composure and couldn't help but mutter: "What's the point?"

However, this time, he didn't even need to use his knowledge skills, and he was lucky enough to encounter a content he had read before when leveling up his knowledge (natural) skill.

"Hey, poet, how can such a sudden and quiet scene give rise to such an oak tree army? If I had such a spell, I could just wave my hand and defeat those players' army."

However, the poet's "legendary knowledge" had just failed, and he didn't have any knowledge (natural) skills to contribute. In this situation, he could only remain silent.

"They've been hiding there from the start," Zhao Xu explained.

The people around him suddenly turned their gaze towards him.

"How is this possible? My detection skill is already 2nd level, and with 2 points of perception adjustment, how could I not notice such an obvious tree person? Even with +4 detection bonus, I couldn't detect it?" Rainbow Wanderer couldn't help but raise his voice.

"The tree people have a +16 racial skill bonus for hiding in the forest," Zhao Xu said calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if the druid himself has a negative value, combined with the racial bonus, the skill against the opponent exceeds that of a rainbow-colored nomad. However, at this moment, everyone's attention was drawn to the front.

A druid riding a ferocious lion emerged from the depths of the forest, with more shadowy figures lurking behind him. The druid's face seemed to conceal a turbulent rage, and the leather armor he wore was wrapped with various vines. The lion under his feet also showed its sharp teeth.

"What level is the lion's rider?" asked the warrior Maple Leaf in awe.

It seems like a 7-level druid, said the priestess with a lazy tone.

Zhao Xu looked at the priestess with a hint of a smile, implying that this was the disadvantage of relying on memory rather than skill.

He also reminded the group not to underestimate this druid, nor the treant army before them, and said, "This is a ferocious lion, at least a 10-level druid can tame it."

After saying that, he looked around at the treants and said, "These treants were summoned by the level 6 druid's spell 'Oak Tree Sentinel', and they can summon two more of the same treants. Don't underestimate this, it's a level 8 monster."

Zhao Xu said, and the 1-level players may not have fully grasped the situation, but mentioning the level 8 challenge clearly made them realize the difficulty.

The challenge level is a recommendation made by Arthur, suggesting that a team of four level 8 adventurers or above is needed to challenge such a monster. Although this recommendation is not entirely accurate in the post-apocalyptic era, it still has some reference value.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The warrior whispered to the leaves, 'Run if the situation calls for it.' Although the druid hadn't spoken yet, this opening move wasn't suitable for a good conversation. Raya, intimidated by the druid's intimidating aura, continued to raise her voice and said, 'Respected Dr. Druid, please allow us to pass, I'm willing to pay a fee to maintain nature, and I also guaranteeâ€”' 'Get lost!'"
