Chapter 357: Hint

"What do you say?" Zhao Xu's gaze was no longer within the ordinary human's tolerance.
In fact, the recent conflict was no different from fifty ants bothering himself, and he didn't think it was a big deal.
If it weren't for him being unable to determine whether these fifty ants were thieves or not, he would have decided to either let them go or not.
As long as Betty's suggestion was reasonable, he could accept it.
Ultimately, he was now playing the role of a goddess priestess, not a Jianghu thief.
"If you, the priestess, allow it, I want to let all these cavalrymen go."
Compared to when Betty was originally besieged, she was now acting like a mediator, begging Zhao Xu instead.
Her guards, including the chief of the guards, all looked calm and normal, without the slightest hint of anger.
Betty saw Zhao Xu's silence and said, "I can use the low-ring aurasphere in my hand as a price to buy their lives."
Zhao Xu saw this and his gaze remained fixed on the leader who had initially ordered the attack, "Rupert".
After sensing Zhao Xu's gaze, Rupert, who was trapped in the web, was so aware of the implication that he immediately understood.
He directly pulled out the short sword tied to his thigh and flashed a dazzling silver light.
Then Rupert suddenly plunged the sword into his own thigh, and his forehead broke out in a cold sweat, with no blood in sight.
However, Rupert was biting his teeth and refused to fall, instead staring at Zhao Xu with a piercing gaze.

Whether you need a second sword?
Zhao Xu saw the situation and was taken aback, unable to imagine that this Robert would be so decisive.

Zhao Xu had been waiting for the other party to beg for mercy a few times, and since they would not be able to recover from this blow, regardless of whether it was the original organization or the subsequent Mrs. Betty, they would all be crushed and trampled into the dust, experiencing the difference between the clouds and the abyss.

However, the other party's apology with a single sword had also saved themselves.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime illustration of the vast gap between the strong and the weak, and it is only by using more extreme methods that small people can show their remorse to the powerful.

Zhao Xu turned around calmly, completely ignoring the aftermath of the battle, and directly returned to the carriage.

As for what happened next, it would naturally be carried out by Mrs. Betty, who had begged the cavalrymen for mercy.

As for the bribe of the scroll, he naturally didn't care.

After the three of them got into the carriage compartment, the coachman directly slapped the soft whip in his hand, preparing to start the journey.

"Commander, the leader of the cavalrymen who attacked us initially intended to ambush us to prevent secrets from leaking out," said Zheng Xin'an, biting his lip and thinking deeply.

"I understand the other party's thoughts, which are relatively pure and have not been completely transformed. Zhao Xu explained, "Just like a player with no roots, the power of evidence is insufficient. And if we really find a successful channel for complaint, many things would have already been decided."

"Killing us is the main thing, and as for secrecy, it's just an afterthought."
Here is the translation of the text:

Eliot suddenly came to his senses, "Sir, why did we let them go again?" However, he showed no reaction to Robert's just-stabbed sword, and if he offended his teacher, he would die, what was the meaning of stabbing a few times?

Zhao Xu looked at the restored carriage door curtain, "Have you finished killing? If you really want to kill, I'll make it clear that it's not a spider web technique, but a fireball technique."

As he spoke, he also looked at the two of them, Eliot being a native of Arthur, who had only touched the same human life once.

Why was the fire so fierce now? If the other party offended himself and others, they would kill without hesitation.

It seemed that he was playing more like a player now.

Only such things, evil barbarians could do, and good shepherds would have to restrain themselves.

When Mrs. Betty heard that she would rather spend a lot of money on a magic scroll to redeem the group.

Zhao Xu understood that the other party would probably think of how to arrange the cavalry unit after hearing the name "Chi Lao".

Thinking that the other party might also be controlled by him in the future, Zhao Xu naturally gave up the approach of cutting the grass and roots.

People like him wouldn't take revenge by stepping on tools, but would go straight to the backstage mastermind controlling the tools.

Just then, the carriage suddenly started to brake, and the speed slowed down significantly.

The coachman poked his head in, "Sir, Mrs. Betty is driving over."

After the coachman turned back, Zhao Xu also poked his head out of the carriage curtain and saw that Mrs. Betty had changed from her previous gentle appearance in the carriage.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the opponent held the child in her arms, she was controlling the warhorse with her legs, exuding a sense of elegance and bravery. "Mr. Pastor, the wheel of the carriage we just sat in has broken, so we can only temporarily ride the horse to make do. However, the child is weak, and I'm worried he'll catch a cold due to the snow. Therefore, I'd like to request that my child be allowed to get on the carriage to avoid the snow."

Behind her, there were still twelve riders, clearly having just arrived. She had already gathered some personnel by using Zhao Xu's flag. The two people sitting in the carriage heard Betty's request through the carriage curtain, although they exchanged glances, feeling a bit strange but unable to put their finger on why.

"Let's get on," Zhao Xu said, looking at the light layer of snow on their clothes.

If it were just the two of them, it would be fine, but the carriage wheel wasn't neglected. Betty had received fifty cavalrymen's support and had no pressure at all, so she could easily fix the wheel.

In the end, Betty was insisting on joining the journey, wanting to get close to Zhao Xu and continue to develop their relationship.

After Betty and her child got on the carriage, she leaned against a corner and her child quietly slept in her arms.

"Mr. Pastor, how do I address you?" Betty asked, considering the journey would not be short.

Zhao Xu, who had no secrets to keep, introduced himself and the identities of the others.

As if sensing Zhao Xu's awkwardness, Betty changed her target and chatted with Zheng Xin and Elliott, laughing melodiously like a silver bell.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though Elliot, who had been carrying a deep grudge against the blood, showed a slight relaxation on his face after seeing Mrs. Betty's tearful eyes. "Do you believe the rumors about the town being haunted?" he asked suddenly. Mrs. Betty, who had been eager to answer, suddenly turned pale when she heard the question. Although she quickly regained her composure and changed the subject to divert the attention of the group, Elliot and Zheng Xin-yi, who were with her, sensed the gravity of the situation. Originally, they had planned to visit the old witch in the town, but now they were faced with a more serious challenge. Mrs. Betty, who had just discovered her own strength, reacted instinctively to conceal her true nature. What kind of shadow was cast by the small town? Or was this a secret that couldn't be revealed by the pastor? Although Elliot thought that the town couldn't possibly hide any supernatural secrets or powerful monsters, he still felt a sense of unease. At this moment, Elliot directly reached into his backpack and pulled out a small glass bottle from the side pocket. With his "hand skills" honed over time, he managed to conceal the bottle in his palm without any visible signs. The bottle contained a snake's tongue, which was smeared with olive oil, a special material used in a particular ritual.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Mrs. Betty, your experience of crossing the blockade line as an orphaned mother has truly impressed me," Zhao Xu suddenly praised, making Mrs. Betty's face turn bright red as she lowered her head.

Zhao Xu clapped his hands, and even the glass bottle held between his thumb and index finger by his martial arts skills went unnoticed.

As he clapped, his whispering incantation was hidden to the extreme in his mouth.

He directly used the "Deception Spell" technique, hiding the process of casting the spell in ordinary-looking actions.

No one in the scene noticed that Zhao Xu was chanting the spell.

Zhao Xu and Wang Qingwei, as well as Esvei, had obtained the transmission of the Deception Spell after passing the true illusion test.

After Zhao Xu finished clapping, the glass bottle held between his fingers had turned empty.

Zhao Xu's actions were extremely smooth and elegant, and he had naturally hidden the small glass bottle containing the material.

At the moment the spell was completed, Mrs. Betty, who had been looking embarrassed, suddenly seemed to be in a daze.

However, she quickly regained her composure.

Zhao Xu's tone carried a hint of profundity as he said to Mrs. Betty, "Since you are currently stranded in Frosty Town with no one to rely on, you should rely on us after reaching there and share information and communicate with us in a timely manner."

Mrs. Betty's eyes lost their sparkle for a moment, as if her eyes had lost their light, but she quickly recovered.

It was as if she had just been controlled by someone for an instant.

"Ah, Mr. Zhong, you're saying that, aren't you?" Mrs. Betty suddenly became enthusiastic and smiled lightly at Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation:

"Adventurer Zhongxia, you successfully cast the "Suggestion" spell on Mrs. Betty, with a duration of 12 hours (1 hour per level)."
