Chapter 253: The Demon Grand Duke

When Frang, the silver-white body of the nine-ring mage, heard Zhao Xu mention the name of the enemy, his entire person seemed to be in disbelief. His body, as if struck by an impact, continued to tremble, producing a metallic collision sound.

Just now, everyone was speculating about the identity of the devil on the other side. Only a demon of this level could play with the nine-ring mage in this way. Who knew that Zhao Xu would finally utter the name of the enemy, which was not the lord of the underworld, but the "Deep Abyss Lord", the "Demon Grand Duke".

Demons and devils have significant differences in terms of their origins and characteristics. Mainly, they occupy opposite ends of the balance of order and chaos. Meanwhile, countless dead demons and devils on the battlefield of blood and war can demonstrate the insurmountable hatred between the two.

Therefore, when Zhao Xu used the name "Demon Grand Duke" to guess the identity of the "devil", how could Frang not be shocked to the point of incredulity? "Wow, Lord, you're still right," Lakis interrupted to praise Zhao Xu. "However, your talent is too strong, and you can still be so sensitive to detect the opponent's demon. Oh, the Demon Grand Duke 'Grazzit' is undoubtedly the strongest demon in the Deep Abyss."

Lakis sighed emotionally.
Here is the translation of the given text:

"It seems that he can deliver a fluent and persuasive speech, using elegant language to convince other beings. It's a bit strange, as if he was pretending to be someone else, like a small person playing the role of a great orator. That's why I'm particularly impressed that you, the master, can see through it."

At this moment, the "Glazet" in the mirror clearly accepted its identity and no longer made any loud noises.

The power brought by Zhao Xu's five miracles has taken shape and formed a binding ring, while the unformed ones slowly woven into a massive net, attempting to envelop this space.

If the opponent fails to fulfill their commitment, they can only be severed from the oath, otherwise, they will definitely not be able to retreat completely.

When it's beneficial to oneself, one can utilize the order of the oath. When it's detrimental, one can use the chaos within oneself to suppress the power of the oath.

This is why "Glazet" can act recklessly in the material world as the most demonic "evil king".

He is both horizontal and vertical.

Trying to suppress this "evil king" solely with wisdom would be nothing more than a joke.

This kind of verbal sparring usually only occurs between two people with similar social status.

If Zhao Xu didn't have the ability of a 20th-level cleric, he wouldn't even dare to attempt it.

In his past life, he knew that the bottom of the Political Affairs Department in Star Lake had a demonic footprint.

It's unknown whether the current Flange left behind a residual altar in his past life, which later released its power and turned an innocent gravekeeper into a half-fiendish being.

As a law enforcement officer, Zhao Xu was naturally assigned to be the common liaison person of the Holy Church, coordinating forces to jointly annihilate the demonic altar.

So, Zhao Xu stood at this location from the beginning and would never guess the answer was demonic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't know how you guessed that, but it's indeed fascinating that you're a priest who can perform five miracles. Since the goddess of magic has bestowed her favor upon you, I won't interfere. I'll wait for you in the depths."

As she spoke, a radiant green gemstone shot out of the mirror and fell directly onto the pile of gold coins.

"Phia, my Phia," Frank suddenly rushed to the gemstone, passionately kissing it as if trying to absorb its power and warmth.

"You've managed to preserve your wife's body, so it's best to examine the gemstone first. Don't rush to perform the ritual by the corpse."

Despite the "Nine-Ring" mage standing opposite him, Frank's unstable mental state made Zhao Xu remind him twice.

"Thank you, thank you, truly too much thanks," Frank's long-held wish was finally fulfilled, and he became incoherent.

Meanwhile, the demon lord "Grazzt" was accidentally bound by Zhao Xu's miracle and promptly dropped the gemstone, releasing the binding force that had been suppressing him. He was now preparing to use his powers to infect Zhao Xu.

This is also a characteristic of Grazzt's behavior, usually saying nothing and suddenly dropping the gemstone to enthrall the "Nine-Ring" mage Frank's mind.

In an instant, Grazzt's intention condensed into a wave of resonance.

"Master, this place has been sealed by Grazzt's power and cannot be transmitted. It's likely that he will soon launch a power attack on you," Lark rushed to remind Zhao Xu.

"He's brewing a mysterious ritual, so he hasn't moved yet. Once he does, he'll likely directly eliminate you, Master."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lysander's tone had become somewhat urgent, "Take your master's soul through death." "I don't know if I have the luck to know your true name, but you're the first one to make me feel so defeated in all these years as 'Grazzt'." The air was suddenly filled with a deep, rich male voice that seemed to have a hypnotic effect, as if it had the power to induce a trance.

Zhao Xiu suddenly thought of the legend of "Grazzt", a dark-skinned devil who had infiltrated the material world, befriending witchcraft practitioners and granting them powerful magical abilities. This shock caused Zhao Xiu to instantly break free from the influenced state and regain clarity in his mind.

He then walked straight ahead, trying to approach the mirror within a range of about a few meters. The energy field emitted by the mirror was growing stronger and stronger, even beginning to distort the spatial vision. It was unclear whether what Zhao Xiu would touch the mirror would be a real object or not.

Zhao Xiu was still feeling the intense energy field emanating from the depths of the underworld.

【Adventurer Zhongxia, under the influence of the underworld's power, your priest level has decreased by 1 level, and you will lose 1 of your 9-circle spells.】
【Adventurer...】
...... Four consecutive prompts, and Zhao Xiu was directly hit, losing all 9 of his divine spells.

However, he finally reached the front of the mirror.

"Anti-magic field." Zhao Xiu shouted directly.

Suddenly, an invisible barrier opened up around Zhao Xiu, covering an area of about three meters in diameter.

This was the smallest range spell Zhao Xiu had ever used, but it was also the most powerful.

Within this thirty-square-meter area...
Here is the translation of the text:

All forms of magic, including supernatural abilities, have been suppressed. This includes all magical items. Originally, the "Anti-Demon Zone" was powerless against divine artifacts and divine power was also unaffected. However, the divine power wielded by "Graldet" is not the true power of the gods, but rather a special divine power granted by the Abyssal Plane. When Graldet reached the plane of Arthur, he had to compress himself countless times, causing the magic mirror providing the power to be suppressed, losing all its abilities. The original divine power supply was instantly cut off.

The eerie whispers of demons lingering in the air began to fade away, and the surroundings returned to quiet. After a few minutes, Zhao Xu finally terminated the effect of the "Anti-Demon Zone".

Then, he picked up the mirror and threw it directly in front of Frank, saying, "Your wife's soul is actually inside the mirror."

Frank's eyes widened in shock.

"That emerald is fake," Zhao Xu said, looking at Frank. "If you smash it, the demon's soul will emerge, infect and occupy your wife, turning her into a demon."

Frank's eyes filled with terror.

"No, what you're saying is that after I shattered the emerald, the miracle power suppressing him weakened because the magic itself was deceived."

"Then, once you destroyed your wife's body, you would ultimately succumb to despair and death. At the moment when you surrender your soul to that demon, it will tell you that your wife's soul has been in the mirror all along, under your control. If you seek help from the gods, you can break the mirror and retrieve your soul."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's all because you dare not defy the will of that demon. Eventually, you will succumb to despair and become the soul offering of the incomparably delicious Grand Master of Magic."

Zhao Xu painstakingly analyzed the "Grazzart" technique, bit by bit.

Unknown to him, after being infected with the abyssal divine power, his thinking became increasingly clear.

The thick fog that had previously shrouded his mind was instantly dispelled by him.

"...I'm not the kind of person who relies on age and experience to become a nine-ring mage," Frank said, his face filled with shame.

He had already gained a basic understanding of Zhao Xu's logical reasoning.

Even when he no longer feared the demon's power lurking behind the mirror, he could use his nine-ring mage's abilities to uncover the truth.

Unfortunately, his opponent's cowardice meant that even if the demon was in a state of utter despair, it could still effortlessly manipulate Frank's actions.

"Thanks for these 'Super Demon Instant Release Rod' and 'Legendary Death Soul Rod', which cannot repay your kindness," Frank said, his face flushing with shame, as he pulled out a piece of "Secret Silver Crystal" from his pocket and placed it on the ground.

Then, Frank bowed to Zhao Xu and said, "I must hurry to revive my wife. If you need me in the future, please send someone here."

As he said this, he pulled out a small notebook from his pocket, which recorded the secrets he had collected from the Star Lake over the years.

Frank then picked up the mirror and cast a teleportation spell to leave.

Zhao Xu understood why Frank was in such a hurry.

After the demon disappeared, Zhao Xu's mind became clear once again, as if he would be ashamed to death if he lingered any longer.

Zhao Xu turned around and looked at the "gains" he had obtained from his recent "resistance" to the demon king.
However, he first picked up the "bone pointer" crafted "Death Soul Rod" instead.

This is a rod that can "seal titles".

As long as the player dies in front of Zhao Xu, he can use the "Soul Binding Technique" to bind the soul.

This will prevent the opponent from reviving.

It can be considered the first major killer of revenge.
