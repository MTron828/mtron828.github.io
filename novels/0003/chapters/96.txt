Chapter 097: Departure

The timing is indeed quite subtle. This timing refers to the excavation of the lost inheritance of the Itier Empire or the excavation of Ernest's secret. Both are unknown numbers.

Zhao Xu also noticed that on the other side of the force field, Luo Ya, the seven people, were watching him calmly and quietly, chatting with the wizard, Ryan, and their emotions were pacified.

Understand that the time to leave is about to come, and he directly spoke up, saying, "Since the leaders of the association have already learned about this, there's no need for me to specifically bring back this information."

To be honest, Zhao Xu didn't want to get too involved in this secret.

What's the point of trying to get something and getting oneself into trouble?

As for the matter of leaking secrets, anyone on the same line as them is a suspect.

"You're overthinking it," he said. "I reported this information to the association a month ago, but no one came. So, I'm sure they must have known about this information earlier. And you wouldn't think that the wizard would send a messenger to find a clue, would you?"

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, thinking it over.

"However, there is something that needs to be given to you," Ryan said, pulling out a small booklet from his dimensional bag.

"This contains some predictions and analyses about the secret that I wrote. Please give it to Anzhi Noya and tell her we've cleared up our accounts."

Zhao Xu took it and asked, "Aren't you going to tell the association about all this?"

Logically, with Anzhi Noya's level, she would also know.
Here is the translation:

"The association isn't just about your final scroll. She definitely knows it in the end, but it's not necessarily now. I'm giving her this thing so she can make her own decisions independently."

"Can't you just directly communicate with Anniya?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

Although he was a player, he could revive even if he died on the road, and he should be able to hand over the scroll to Anniya. However, giving her this thing still has some risks.

He may leak the information, even if the probability is low. As a performer, Leiren may seem reliable, but his true nature is likely to be more cautious.

"I saw you and decided to tell Anniya," Leiren said with a smile.

His gaze was like looking at a bookmark, making Zhao Xu feel a bit uneasy. He couldn't help but ask, "What's the connection to me or Anniya?"

Although Ernest's secrets were tempting, Leiren understood Anniya so well that it wasn't her thing. She wouldn't even bother to take a look.

"Anniya will tell you when you get back," Leiren said, returning to his mysterious demeanor.

Zhao Xu hated talking to these wizards, who liked to be vague and mysterious, like fortune-telling. "Just let them go, and we'll leave. We'll seal the entrance later."

"Seal? What's the point? I'll just hide this place when I'm back. You can try to get in if you have the ability. However, you took the wrong path. When you went down that platform, the path to the left was the way to the secret underground city, but the trash inside has already been taken by the previous adventurers. It's a waste to go."

Zhao Xu couldn't believe the result and felt a bit strange: "Isn't this the underground city?"

"It's definitely not. This is my own base," Leiren said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But isn't there a room filled with the names of the demon lords outside, and an altar?" Zhao Xu asked with a mixture of surprise and wariness.

As he spoke, he also tensed up, ready to react if the mage, Lyren, didn't make sense. Offering sacrifices to the demon lords wasn't something that could be easily brushed aside.

"The altar was set up by my former comrades," Lyren said with a faint tone, "I also used it to observe how they obtained that kind of power and research how to sever the connection. So, I left it there, and if it's dismantled, it will just restore itself. You can report this to the temple later, they know about this."

Hearing this, Zhao Xu's words trailed off.

"Right, who is your shadow?" Lyren suddenly changed the subject and asked.

"Shadow?" Zhao Xu had never heard of this question before.

"Didn't Anzhiya tell you that when you chose the secret transmission during the final scroll selection, it was one clear and one shadowed? You are the clear transmission, and there must be a shadow transmission as well," Lyren explained.

Zhao Xu's mind flashed with the image of Wang Qingwei, but he quickly denied it, as the other party was not the final scroll.

"Ah, ah, take note, the clear and shadowed transmissions usually choose partners who are relatively close," Lyren smiled playfully.

"What do you mean?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Just that you're an Earth adventurer, and the other party is probably 8 out of 10 also an Earth adventurer," Lyren chuckled.

As soon as he heard this, Zhao Xu didn't have much to worry about anymore, as he didn't believe there were players like that now.

"Alright, you can all leave now," Lyren said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu discovered that his seven teammates had already been transported to his side.
As everyone was stunned for a moment, they quickly raised their weapons and pointed them at Reinhardt the mage.

"We've misunderstood, this is the domain of the lord, we've just wandered in by mistake, let's leave and explain later," Zhao Xu hurriedly explained.

After this ordeal, everyone basically trusted Zhao Xu, and they slightly relaxed their grip on their weapons.

However, Mu Ye couldn't help but ask Zhao Xu a question: "What is your occupation?" It was as if he was afraid that the Zhao Xu in front of him was an illusion.

Zhao Xu didn't expect Mu Ye to remain clear-headed, and his heart was still racing as he looked at Reinhardt the mage with a bad temper: "Teacher."

Reinhardt the mage didn't expose him and continued to stand elegantly, waiting for them to leave.

"Well, let's go then," Luo Ya also understood that if there was a lord in the underground city, then they would be courting death if they entered without permission. It would be best to leave with dignity.

"How do we avoid this?" Zhao Xu asked Reinhardt the mage, looking at the location where the cursed tower had just disappeared.

"It's fake, just walk straight through," Reinhardt the mage smiled haughtily.

"Fake?" everyone found it hard to believe.

"How is that possible? Those spells are clearly..."

Suddenly, a demonic statue appeared in front of them, and the demonic head opened its mouth, with a fireball spell seeming to shoot out.

"Ah." Everyone was shocked by the terrifying scene and scattered to avoid it.

However, nothing happened.

Zhao Xu finally understood, "You must have been eavesdropping on us, I mentioned the cursed tower, so you used illusions to make us think there was a cursed tower set up here?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu saw that he had hit his mark, Lena the wizard laughed with great satisfaction, saying, "That's it, so you know that when you go on adventures in the future, don't talk nonsense. As for those spells that came crashing down, they were all invisible spells I cast, and I just happened to have a four-level staff of magic wands."

Zhao Xu looked at Lena with a bad temper and cursed him to his face, saying, "You're wasting your magic wands, Lena. The energy of my staff is not free."

As for that pitfall trap, I brought it over from the underground city on the other side. That spell is pretty cool, haha. You can all go directly now, I've already returned to the other side."

At this time, Zhao Xu was already tired of talking to Lena and led his teammates away without looking back.

"Hey, hey, you haven't told me why you know that I used illusions," Lena's voice echoed from around the corner.

But Zhao Xu's voice was already gone, and Lena's face fell. He thought to himself, "So that's what you're doing? This is your 'deception spell' technique, which makes it impossible for me to detect spells and counterattack."

But soon, his expression turned gloomy.

That kid was just about to take him down, and he suddenly leveled up. This kind of aura of power was also intimidating. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been quickly exposed.

As for that group of adventurers last time, he had used illusions to play with them, making them want to cry and beg for mercy before he let them go.

"Ah, these things are none of my business. Let the Miss Itt√©r Annyo handle it herself."

..."Ahh..." A beautiful girl with a book in the darkness, dressed in a cloak and flipping through the pages of a book, felt a bit chilly and couldn't help but let out a sneeze.
Here is the translation:

"She reads very quickly, glancing through the book and then flipping back to the previous page, as if she has the ability to remember everything she reads. The black-haired girl with purple eyes wore a robe with a blessing mark on it, which was a ritual that increased her magic level by one, and her name was embroidered on it - 'Esvei'."
