Chapter 80: Aftermath

Zhao Xu one by one lifted up the people who had fallen to the ground, but the ones who had lost consciousness remained motionless and failed to wake up.

He also went to take a look at Luo Ya.

Luo Ya's life force was estimated to be at the forefront, barely holding on to his life after being hit by the Yin Soul, and was in a critical condition.

Just as he was waiting for someone with medical skills to come and help, Zhao Xu had a treatment spell and didn't feel like wasting his skill points on medical skills.

He just wanted to have the ability, not to become a medical expert.

As the four people remained unconscious until around the 5th round (30 seconds), Zhao Xu began to realize that the difficulty of casting the spell varied depending on the person using it.

Zhao Xu had an intelligence adjustment of +3, and when he cast the rainbow spray spell, the difficulty of the spell would be 10 + 1 (spell level) + 3 (intelligence) = 14, which was DC14.

The four people of Maple Leaf would at least have half of them wake up, and it wouldn't be a complete defeat.

However, since everyone was unconscious, he only pulled out the prayer candle.

The original use of the prayer candle was for priests to light it during spell preparation, allowing them to gain divine power, equivalent to a high-level priest.

For example, Zhao Xu could prepare divine power like a 3rd-level priest.

If he cast the spell while lighting the candle, he could cast the spell like a 3rd-level priest.

Each prayer candle could last for 4 days and 3 hours, allowing Zhao Xu to pretend to be a 3rd-level priest for 4 days.
Here is the translation of the text:

The prayer candle consumed all its components in an instant to unleash the 9th-grade spell "Gate of the Abyss". This is too tyrannical.

Ordinary people who want to use the 9th-grade spell "Gate of the Abyss" from the magical scroll need the skill "Magic Device", but the prayer candle can do it with just a match.

Before the catastrophic era, the prayer candle had once spread wildly, with many powerful beings from other worlds causing trouble every day, driven by mysterious forces to rush to the scene to rescue.

This intense resentment ultimately affected the world's will, making it difficult not only to create the prayer candle but also making it a taboo item.

The 8400 GP price tag that was circulating before the catastrophic era was simply because of the 4200 GP production cost, and it was priced at twice the cost. It's not like this price could buy it.

Zhao Xu was reluctant to take it out, and even when he saw the Druid, he wasn't holding the prayer candle. This thing itself is a troublemaker.

If it weren't for Luo Ya lying on the ground, near death, and the many mercenaries scattering to flee, he would have found another way to solve the problem.

The native people of Aria are not those kind of NPCs who give you tasks and clap for you. They won't give you a pat on the back just because you're a good player.

Players flaunting their wealth are often the victims of native thieves, and it's never news. He didn't want to be sold by someone in Bratan City or Kasok City.

One prayer candle may not be enough to mobilize great power, but the channel behind it represents a lot.

So, sometimes players are weak, and it's not a bad thing.

However, Zhao Xu is still worried about the just-consumed components.

He naturally can't summon the top-level angel, just to play around with the spirit of the dead.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu chose to use the prayer candle because it was the only way to scare away the ghost at a low cost. The only cost was that the next time he wanted to cast the "Portal to the Other Realm" spell, the success rate would be only 80-90%.

"Ah, gone again," the priestess muttered to herself as she woke up.

She was still a bit disoriented, thinking that her whole body had just stiffened from reviving. It wasn't until she took a closer look at the surroundings, which were similar to before, that she exclaimed in a tone filled with shock, "Now that I've revived, let's take a look at the effects. Maple Leaf Brother, we've revived in the same place!"

However, when she shook her surroundings, she found that the other party members were still in a state of shock and hadn't woken up yet.

She suddenly snapped out of it, crying out, "Ghost!"

With a look of fear, she scanned her surroundings with her short neck, but there was no sign of the ghost.

"Wake up. The ghost is gone," Zhao Xu said helplessly.

This kind of behavior from the priestess was a typical example of giving opportunities and not taking advantage of them, and she was able to keep the enemy under control for two rounds.

"Pastor, do you have a medical skill? If you do, go and treat the leader over there and see if you can stabilize his injuries," Zhao Xu said.

"That's definitely possible, Brother of the Healer. I didn't receive my divine art until later, but I used my medical skill to restore everyone's status beforehand," the priestess replied.

Zhao Xu just smiled when he heard this.

This priestess, who looked like she was not very smart, didn't seem to be as useless as she seemed.

With the aid of the medical skill, players could recover 2 times as much natural recovery as normal. That is, 8 hours of medical care could recover 2 HP, and 24 hours of rest could recover 4 HP.

Although the situation was precarious, it was still better than having nothing. The colorful explosion itself was already under control, and Zhao Xu wasn't worried about the sudden deaths of a few players. Later, the three maple leaves slowly woke up, and Luo Ya, under the medical skills of his teammates, stabilized his injuries and regained consciousness. However, he couldn't move too much and had to rest for a while.

It wasn't until the next morning that Luo Ya finally gathered the remaining players together. Many people had witnessed the presence of ghostly apparitions the night before and felt a sense of power, agility, and physical strength being drained away. This terrifying curse destroyed the minds of most people, and even some of Luo Ya's close friends didn't dare to return to check on the situation for over an hour.

Some players even lost their attributes and fell into a state of helplessness, numbness, or even death. By the time the sun rose, there were four bodies wrapped in white cloth on the ground.

However, Zhao Xu was not a saint, and he only had one life. He couldn't always be holding a candle to protect everything. Moreover, the situation had already reached a critical point, and it was reasonable for players to flee in emergency situations.

So Zhao Xu could only silently pray for the warriors who had lost their lives in the night, hoping they could return to the divine realm. Furthermore, considering the emergency evacuation protocol of the adventure agreement, it was understandable that players directly fled to the arbitration court of the just god.

However, after reorganizing the team, Luo Ya didn't ask Zhao Xu a single question. Even the entire team looked at him with a subtle sense of reverence.
After the chaos last night, many damaged goods could only be handled on the spot, so a vacant horse-drawn carriage was released. The four players, led by Feng Ye, also rode on the vacant horse-drawn carriage with Zhao Xu. However, as soon as everyone sat comfortably and the coachman cracked the whip to start moving, they all looked at Zhao Xu with curious eyes without exception.
