Chapter 078: Desperate Situation

"Magical Weapon!"

As the ghostly figure approached Zhao Xu's face, he finally managed to utilize his "Multitalented Arcanist" ability, converting two zero-level spells into a first-level spell, "Magical Weapon", which he released.

With his hand aglow, Zhao Xu didn't hesitate, quickly channeling the energy to the warrior Maple Leaf's greatsword.

The sword, which had been damaged for half a month, suddenly emitted a bright glow, like a shining weapon.

"Is it a +1 Magical Weapon?" Maple Leaf exclaimed, shocked, after refreshing his character card with the weapon information.

Magical Weapons, ranging from +1 to +5, could enhance the holder's attack and damage capabilities, and even grant special abilities. The simplest +1 weapon required 2000 GP, a cost that was far beyond the player's means, even for a veteran like Luo Ya.

The ghost, however, let out a cold, raspy laugh, like a gust of cold air.

It didn't even spare a glance at the warrior Maple Leaf, who had already injured it, and continued to charge straight at Zhao Xu.

It was clear to everyone in the scene that Zhao Xu was the greatest threat to it.

"Maple Leaf, hurry up and fight that ghost, your weapon is strong enough!" Yu Yu, who had learned magic, cried out urgently.

Yu Yu had already lost all her priest abilities and could only wield her shield frantically.

Hearing Yu Yu's words, Maple Leaf regained his composure and let out a mighty roar, performing the standard attack move he had practiced every day, charging straight at the ghost with his sword held high.
After completing the spell, Zhao Xū had no instant-cast spell available, and he could no longer continue casting spells within a single round, so he immediately retreated backward. The nearby pastors and wanderers hurriedly approached, shielding him with their shields, despite knowing they were also in danger. The poet, who had been singing an uplifting song, suddenly stopped, and the morale-boosting effect on everyone's bodies began to count down from five rounds.

The wraith's speed was impressive, and it directly leaped into the air, flying around Zhao Xū and heading towards him.

In an instant, Zhao Xū felt the wraith's presence, akin to a bat spreading its wings, charging towards him.

The wraith, having successfully possessed Zhao Xū, was ecstatic, already thinking of how to slaughter everyone present, just as it had once slaughtered those merchants.

A dark and eerie energy began to emanate from its soul.

Just as the wraith was about to envelop Zhao Xū in a deep embrace, Zhao Xū's protective abilities surged forth, forming an invisible barrier that directly crushed the wraith's accumulated attachments.

【Adventurer Zhong Xia, your "Protection from Evil" spell ability responds to the wraith's "Possession" supernatural ability, ignoring the effects of the cursed soul jar. The spell's duration is 1 minute and 7 rounds, during which you are immune to this effect.】

Even Zhao Xū, who had anticipated this, couldn't help but exhale a sigh.

This was the unbeatable aspect of the first-level Protection from Evil spell, which didn't require a saving throw and allowed him to be immune to this effect.

At the same time, the warrior, Maple Leaf, finally arrived, swinging his sword at the wraith.

Maple Leaf had also seen powerful warriors wielding magical weapons in the city, and this was his first time holding such equipment, filling him with limitless courage.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, when the blade entered the spirit's body, it was as if a cow was entering the ocean, without any effort at all. Maple Leaves blinked her eyes, unable to accept that she had only cut through an illusion.

"Continue, unless it's a spirit weapon, otherwise there's a 50% chance of losing," Zhao Xu shouted in dismay.

This is the terrifying aspect of spirits, even with magical weapons, the attack still has a 50% chance of being lost. Even if it doesn't manifest, those present can't even see it.

"Stun!" The poet toad had already stopped singing and successfully released his only zero-level spell.

However, the spell's yellow glow entered the spirit's body like rain flowing into a creek, with only faint ripples.

Zhao Xu almost spat out blood, wondering what effect his spell would have on a living being. However, he didn't have time to tell the poet what to do, and continued to chant his own spell - "Magic Missile".

A force field missile, condensed with magical power, directly struck the spirit's body, causing the spirit's body to waver slightly.

【Zhao Xu cast the spell "Magic Missile", dealing 1D4+1=2+1=3 points of damage】

Only force field spells can have a 100% effect on these spirit beings, without losing any attacks.

But this spirit was not the skeletal remains Zhao Xu had seen before, with an average life value. This small amount of damage was not a burden to it at all.

However, Zhao Xu had gained the information he wanted through this attack.

This spirit was just a normal spirit within its range, not yet empowered.

At this time, Maple Leaves finally managed to swing her second sword, relentlessly aiming it at the spirit.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, this time his attack was directly repelled by the ghost's bias force on its body.

Warrior Maple's face turned pale, and he didn't expect himself to miss the attack, but was instead blocked by the ghost's defense.

Zhao Xun's head was about to go numb at this point, wondering how many charm points this ghost had. It was able to easily use its own defense bias to deflect the powerful attack.

"Mooning." The ghost finally spoke a sentence, but with an endless tone of mockery.

It flew lightly, and soon landed in front of Zhao Xun and the others, then raised its hand, as if about to scatter death.

【Adventurer Xiaoming performed a spell identification on the ghost ahead, 7 + 1D20 = 7 + 5 = 12, spell identification failed.】

Before Zhao Xun could recover from the shock, a seven-colored rainbow beam shot towards them.

Seven-color burst!
Without needing to identify the spell, Zhao Xun recognized this as a spell he had used on Anniya before.

【Adventurer Xiaoming performed an insight check, 4 + 1D20 = 4 + 20 = 24, DC18, succeeded.】

Zhao Xun's body felt numb, and he saw this prompt.

He hadn't even had time to be excited about his good luck through the check when he discovered that the surrounding environment was silent.

This ghost had only used a seven-color burst to knock out all four players in the team, leaving them in a coma-like state.

Those who did not pass the saving throw would fall into a coma for 2D4 rounds, then be stunned for 1D4 rounds, and finally be forced to be stunned for 1 round.

Even with good luck, it would take 24 seconds to recover. If unlucky, it would take 13 rounds, or one and a half minutes.

"This time is enough to send someone off."

Zhao Xun sighed in frustration.
He didn't expect that the pastor in front of him would collapse, and it seemed that his profession's exemption bonus was being revoked.

Without any obstacles, the person in front of him, Zhao Xu, seemed like a delicious meal to the ghost.

The smuggling team had already escaped cleanly in the just-completed battle.

Facing this desperate scene, Zhao Xu also smiled lightly.

When encountering a biological entity of this level, he didn't know whether it was his bad luck or the ghost's bad luck.
