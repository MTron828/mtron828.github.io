Chapter 098: The Nine Swords

"Is it dawn already, Xiu?" Zhang Qi asked, looking at Zhao Xiu, who had logged off at around 10 pm.

Zhao Xiu's online and offline times had been quite regular these few days, and today he was even earlier than yesterday.

After being driven out of the mine by the mage Lyra, the team had set up camp nearby and waited for the next day to continue their journey.

Zhao Xiu, on the other hand, had decided to log off early to review some data.

"Qi, have there been any 2-star players recently?" Zhao Xiu asked, casually searching for keywords on the forum.

Zhao Xiu usually browsed the forum during his offline time, while Zhang Qi spent most of his day browsing the forums and various Arthurian groups, participating in commercial exchanges.

As a result, Zhao Xiu often received firsthand information that wasn't available on the forum from Zhang Qi.

"There are 2-star players, and some warriors have even reached the 3-star threshold. Yesterday, I think there was a player named No Night who became the first to reach 2-star. However, the mage profession definitely doesn't have 2-star players, or they would have been blown up long ago."

"Now everyone knows that even if you have the experience to reach 2-star, you need to complete your skills and specialties first. So the first-ranked mage has returned to the academy to further their studies. The other mages in the vanguard team are mostly incomplete, with only a few having completed all their skills and specialties. However, there are no mages who have accumulated enough experience."

"However, I've heard that some mage players have become fed up with the profession and are planning to delete their accounts and protest to TC."

While Zhao Xu was thinking, he had been busy for the past few days, focusing on adventurous content and memory magic. He didn't expect the players' progress to be so slow compared to his imagination.

Unbeknownst to him, he had already ranked among the top players in the world.

Zhao Xu, with his dual expertise, calculated all his abilities by combining the best of two professions.

In his skill points, he adopted the 6-point foundation of the Monk profession, not the ordinary 2 points of the Mage profession. With a 4-fold bonus at level 1, he effectively had 16 more skill points than a mage of the same intelligence level.

Additionally, he had two extra specializations, which could be said to have started with more effort than other players to level up.

However, Zhao Xu was eager for more of this sweet burden.

Just two specializations, "Precognition" and "Multitasker", allowed him to break free from the predicament of having to determine the spell earlier.

It can be said that Zhao Xu's Mage had a higher degree of freedom than the spontaneous casters.

Other Mages had to allocate their spell slots wisely, dividing their time between damage spells, control spells, and defensive spells. In times of crisis, they could only sigh at the useless spells.

Therefore, Mages could only break free from this predicament when they leveled up and had enough spell slots.

"Xu, I've noticed that everyone has gone crazy playing this game lately," Zhang Qi said, pointing to his mouse. "Many people have sunk into the game, skipping classes and even going on dates in the game."

"Even Shi Nan has been playing Saint Warrior for the past few days, and he's been writing his homework normally. Recently, he's been copying the scriptures of the Just God," Zhang Qi exaggerated.

Chen Siren is probably the most diligent in their dormitory in terms of studying, but he comes from a middle-class background and can only strive to graduate and find a job as soon as possible. Zhao Xu and Zhang Qi, on the other hand, are not interested in this, and only Liu Hanqing, who comes from a family of officials, chooses to pursue further studies.

"Zhang Qi, what about you?" Zhao Xu asked, looking at Zhang Qi. "What are your plans?"

"Plans? I can just get my degree and make my parents happy," Zhang Qi laughed, saying that his parents would be overjoyed if he got into a 985 university.

He had originally planned his route for studying abroad, but who knew that Zhang Qi's high school exams had exploded.

"I'm talking about your in-game route," Zhao Xu suddenly said seriously.

He gazed at Zhang Qi, who still looked carefree, and his mind flashed back to the solemn and brave warrior Zhang Qi from his memories.

"Well, I'll just level up, and each level I'll get a skill, and I think it's pretty cool," Zhang Qi said with a satisfied expression.

Listening to this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but remember when Zhang Qi had used this reason to persuade him to choose the warrior instead of Saint Knight, which was suggested by Chen Siren.

Zhao Xu smiled and said, "Do you want to take on a part-time job or advance?"

Part-time jobs for humans have fewer restrictions than those of other races, and Zhang Qi's part-time job won't have a huge impact.

"Ah, the teachings of Saint Knights and monks are not suitable for me, and I'm definitely not up for it. Barbarians are too stupid, and I don't like it. As for mages, I'm even more at a loss," Zhang Qi said, having researched online forums for a long time.

"By the way, have you heard of the 'Nine Swords' profession, which is said to exist on the eastern continent?"

Zhao Xu's tone had a mysterious hint.

...

That night, when Zhao Xu logged back in, everyone was exhausted and had gone to sleep early.
Here is the translation:

As he was about to pull out his sleeping bag from his Howard backpack, he suddenly felt an inner connection request - a request from the wizard "Lyren" to establish a "mind link" communication.

Zhao Xu looked around, but didn't see any shadowy figures. He took out his staff from his backpack and directly agreed to the communication.

"Unexpectedly, you're quite cautious, don't worry, it's just a simple mind link communication that won't harm you," Lyren's voice transmitted over.

Zhao Xu furrowed his brow, "What's the matter?"

He always felt that whenever he met Lyren, something bad would happen.

"It's not that I have anything to say, but I've left some unfinished business. I've said too many secrets to you, and I forgot to give your partner, Maple Leaf, the antidote to that curse."

Zhao Xu only realized this now, he had forgotten to ask Lyren to cast the antidote at the time.

"That's not possible," Zhao Xu asked back.

"That's definitely the case."

"That means the wizard can also cast spells at a distance now?" Zhao Xu thought back to those spells, some of which could be cast remotely, but at least one had to see the opponent first.

"There are spells that can be cast at a distance, but the spell to remove the curse requires physical contact, I was just hiding in plain sight," Lyren answered with a hint of mockery.

"That's all, I'll sleep now?"

"What, you're really impolite, I came to tell you kindly, it's best to remind that Maple Leaf warrior to 'delete the character' in case something happens," Lyren said.

"Your meaning is that he will have an accident?" Zhao Xu's face darkened.

"I didn't say that, you said it yourself," Lyren replied.

Maple Leaf is definitely fine now, but in a year, players will lose their spiritual protection.
