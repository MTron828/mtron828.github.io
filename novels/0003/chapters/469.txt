Chapter 470: Fiery Red Lips

For the next half a day, Freya's voice "Heart-to-Heart" did not appear again, but the first sentence had already left Zhao Xu feeling extremely surprised and filled with caution.

As he was on his way to Zhuling Lake, he had taken the name of a pastor named "Feng" and had also brought a giant scythe, but he had added an extra layer of concealment.

Who would have thought that this private daughter of Tangde, who was not yet a year old, could so easily connect him.

Even Freya hadn't introduced him as the "suspected" wizard who had obtained the divine artifact, "Summer".

But Freya could still call him out, which made Zhao Xu carefully review their encounter.

The carriage continued to roll "yee-haw" through the streets of Oulu City, and Zhao Xu looked out the window, gazing at the scenery outside.

He could see that the surrounding buildings all had a certain historical flavor, similar to the Oulu he had remembered from his previous life, which was filled with architectural heritage.

However, when they arrived at the Governor's Office, they were told that Tangde had important matters to attend to in the afternoon and couldn't meet with them. Even Freya's uncle, who was also Tangde's nephew and closest advisor, was unable to see them.

He could only sulk and apologize, saying that he couldn't introduce him to Tangde today.

However, Freya patted his chest and assured him that he would personally take him to the city's wizard association tomorrow.

Because today is a holiday for the association's branch, most people have taken a break. He went there too, but it was a waste of time. Seeing Zhao Xu's expressionless face, Freire quickly patted his chest and assured him that there would be a high-level banquet in the evening, and he would bring Zhao Xu along and personally introduce him to the attendees. Zhao Xu was delighted and grateful.

In his previous life, he relied on the protection of "Fleur" to enter the stage of "Oro City". This time, as a four-ring mage, he took a different approach and boldly entered the scene.

However, before the big organizations published the investigation results, Zhao Xu was still considered a "7th-level player holding a divine artifact" in identity.

When he defeated hundreds of enemies, he exceeded the expectations of those who had not mobilized their troops in advance. However, in the city where legendary strong individuals existed, even more people were not afraid of him. Those who had the ability, confidence, and courage to take him on were not just a few.

Before his identity was publicly disclosed by the Mage Association's branch, he could not sit comfortably.

As a result, their cart continued to move along the road in Oro City, with a light snowfall outside. There were few players or residents on the street, and everything was quiet.

"This Freire brat is really stingy, not even arranging a maid," said White Dragon Serus, who had transformed into a burly man, complaining.

After being educated by Zhao Xu's "Frosty Touch", it finally understood that there was no one in Zhao Xu's team who was pleasant to deal with.

Although it was licking its face in the middle compartment, it was still seeking guidance from Zhao Xu on the powerful magic that could defeat the elderly White Dragon and render it unable to live.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xū's gaze fell on him, he still lost his composure and didn't dare to provoke him, and instead became a "simple and virtuous dragon" in reality.

"After rejecting my offer, the maid is now yours," Zhao Xū said after hearing Serus's complaints.

"Huh, you don't know that in the noble families of Aurorville, they all have special maids who receive guests," Serus complained, "and I'm surprised that despite having several maids watching me, I didn't even get a single hug."

Zhao Xū could only look at Serus, who was still standing there with his shirt off and his muscles bulging, having walked into the courtyard with various poses.

Just moments ago, Serus had gotten off the horse and taken off his upper body clothing, walking into the courtyard with various poses, with the intention of making a show.

"I thought you were testing your ability to transform into a human and maintain your physical strength in cold weather," Zhao Xū said with a hint of mockery.

On the side, Viola had quietly sat down at a distance, having changed back into her casual clothes earlier. When they were allocating the rooms, she and Zhao Xū had been assigned to the same room, while the shameless dragon had been alone in his room.

"That's natural," the dragon said, his gaze also overflowing with emotion. "How could he not think about his daughter, how could he compare to a fragrant human girl?"

"So you've been causing trouble before?" Viola asked calmly, her tone devoid of emotions.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xū noticed that her hand had again reached for the sacred avenger, but the dragon facing them had not noticed this possible scene that could cause his lineage to end.
Here is the translation:

"Hmm, what a ridiculous thing to say, don't you know that Grandpa White Dragon has such great allure to the rural village girls?" White Dragon swung his robust arms, as if his muscles were filled with scales, and his biceps bulged like a weightlifter's. "I'm much stronger than those country bumpkins who can't even eat a full meal and have a yellowish and emaciated complexion."

Hearing this, Zhao Xiu also lost his patience to educate the other person.

Arthur did not strictly enforce racial segregation, otherwise there would be so many half-elves, half-orphans, and so on.

As for the creatures with templates such as half-dragon, half-heaven, and half-hell, the numbers are countless.

As he looked at the white dragon, he thought that expanding the directory of dragon-like creatures was a trivial matter, as long as it was willing.

The original intention of praying for strength was, after all, everyone's inner pursuit.

Even in his past life, he had fantasized about being an incredibly powerful person who could move mountains and stir up the sea.

"Zhong Xia Da Ye, don't say that your white dragon brother Serus didn't invite you, how about we go to the city tonight and have some fun? I know some local brothels and I'm familiar with their skills."

After drinking the "old wine" brought by Freyr, Serus let out a cold breath, and his entire body was in a state of slight intoxication, and he began to boast loudly.

"Vivian, tonight can you watch over this white dragon, don't let it go anywhere, wait until tomorrow we've seen the key figures in the city of Auror."

Zhao Xiu ordered.

"Okay." At this time, Vivian's expression seemed to flash with a sharp edge, "Unless I die, it won't be allowed to step out of this room."

As she spoke, she raised her long sword, which was still sheathed, but the intention was already focused on the white dragon.

"That's not going to happen to you, right?" Vivian received the order but didn't forget to care about Zhao Xiu's whereabouts.

"I?" Zhao Xiu smiled slightly, his expression a little awkward, "I have to go meet someone privately tonight, it's not convenient to bring too many people, so you two can stay here."

Sirus's face turned red with discontent, saying, "Ah, Uncle Zhou, you're not going to sneak off to that red-light district without me, the benevolent white dragon? I finally managed to smoothly enter this city after so much effort."

Zhou Xun smiled inwardly, thinking that Sirus was not as "experienced" as he had boasted.

Just listening to Sirus's speculations, Zhou Xun could only say that the other party was using a perverted and depraved mind to speculate about him, a virtuous and upright gentleman.

In reality, Sirus was truly interested in the development of his descendants, and after removing his helmet, he revealed a charming smile, making Vivi a more attractive choice.

It seemed that the white dragon's eyes were blind, not knowing that the true national beauty was right beside him.

Zhou Xun didn't say a word, reorganizing his luggage and fully armed, as if he was going to fight to the death.

At that moment, his mind was still replaying the note with the location of the paper, which was given to him by a servant girl who accidentally bumped into him in the evening, containing a secret code - "Pastor's Wind" - between him and Fleur.

As well as another location - the famous "Flaming Lips" of Oloro City, where people indulge in pleasure.

"...You're early," a sweet and gentle voice came from the shadows.

"Hmm?" Zhou Xun turned back, surprised to find Fleur standing in the corner, fully dressed in a tight-fitting outfit from head to toe, with a mask and a tight-fitting dress.

At first glance, she had a stunning figure, long legs, and long, wavy hair, with tempting lips. However, at this moment, she was dressed in a chain mail shirt and a small sword, looking like a lightly dressed night raid.

"It seems you've recognized me," Zhou Xun said in surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There's no mistake, I can only say that your disguise skills at that time were decent enough to deceive those players. For someone like me who specializes in observing and reading people's expressions, it's not like I'm comparing apples and oranges. At that time, I didn't come out from the shadows."

Zhao Xuan didn't refute this.

At that moment, he had just returned to Winter's City after seeing Freya and had used the prayer candle to summon the Archangel Ariniel and then performed the "Holy Spirit Possession" to become a level 9 Cleric.

Before encountering Freya, his disguise skills were indeed limited to just "illusion" and not very high.

"Just what you said, 'Summer Solstice Mage', is that a guess?" Zhao Xuan continued to ask.

However, Freya shook her head. "No."

"Oh, it seems that the guards have leaked the information," Zhao Xuan nodded.

At that time, the only ones who knew his identity were his friend Freya and the guards under his command.

Freya could have the information conveyed to Freya's mansion within half a day and had her maid relay the meeting address to her.

It was also normal to have someone stationed among the guards, especially since the current leader of the alliance was her biological father, and many things were a matter of course for her.

However, the guards were able to smoothly leak the information, which was quite unexpected.

"What do you mean, Freya, why did you bring me here?" Zhao Xuan asked.

"What's that?" Zhao Xuan asked.

"What do you know, now that you're in this situation?"

Zhao Xuan's gaze shifted to the "Legendary Death Spirit Staff" in his arms and the "Legendary Mage Statue" that he had never taken out before.

At the same time, he patted the jade stone in his pocket that contained the residual effects of the "Dragon Tribe Assault" legend.
With these tricks up his sleeve, he should be okay, right?
