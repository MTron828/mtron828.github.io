Chapter 117: Anger

Zhao Xu, who had previously worked as a city administrator, knew that he could easily infiltrate the high-level organization that controlled tens of cities. He had undergone numerous trials and had built a vast network of relationships within the organization.

Looking at the man in front of him, Tak, who was dressed in a luxurious robe, Zhao Xu estimated that Tak was a member of a noble family with a high social status. Tak's life value was higher than that of ordinary people, and he was also more powerful.

It was unlikely that someone with Tak's temperament could achieve such a high position without a strong background. Arthur's theory of "only the strong survive" was true, but strong individuals also had family and friends. Therefore, it was possible for non-strong individuals to also receive benefits.

"Look at the few mages by your side, and you're still eyeing my magical notes?" Zhao Xu said calmly, waiting for Tak to take the bait.

"Haha!"

Tak laughed loudly, as if he had heard something hilarious. "Who are you deceiving?"

"If you think my magical notes are just a ordinary book, do you think I would spend so much effort to catch those few stray cats and surround you? You know how much effort I put in to catch those cats and surround you?"

Tak continued, "Even Isis thought she had gotten something precious, but she didn't think about whether some things are beneath the likes of you, the lowly scum. If I hadn't been afraid of stirring up a hornet's nest, I would have caught you before dealing with Isis. But I didn't want to let her get away."

As Tak spoke, Zhao Xu slowly pieced together the entire plot.

He immediately asked, "Have you gone to that mine?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"As expected, although the mage had used a spell to hide the mine, it was impossible to keep it a secret. Unfortunately, by the time we arrived, he had already disappeared. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had to waste my energy chasing after you scoundrels."

Tark said, a smile spreading across his face.

"It's really amazing, who would have thought that there would be a clue to the treasure hidden in the mine. Poor those initial adventurers, they entered the treasure trove and only took a few magical items, thinking they had gotten off easy, only to be swindled in the end."

"You guys look at each other, you're keeping secrets from each other, but he's keeping a bigger secret from you."

Tark's expression suddenly turned ecstatic as he pointed at the Maple Leaf group, his face flushed with excitement.

The Maple Leaf group was trapped, their faces filled with anger as they glared at Tark.

"Some things aren't meant for you to touch, and even knowing about them would be disastrous."

Zhao Xu's expression remained calm as he looked at Tark.

Zhao Xu was well aware of the horrors of these treasures, and he didn't even want to know about them at first.

Let alone let the Maple Leaf group know. After all, death is the end of the world.

In the Arthurian world, sometimes the soul returns to the world after death, which is a happy event.

But what's even more terrifying is that the soul is imprisoned and cannot be reborn.

Who knows that this sentence struck a chord in Tark's heart. He immediately waved his hand, and a heavily armored guardian appeared, directly stabbing at the suspended Rock, who was struggling to make a sound with his mouth gagged with a cloth.

The sword stayed in Rock until it turned red, and the heavily armored guardian finally pulled out the sword. Rock struggled a few times before going limp.

Zhao Xu was not affected by Rock's betrayal, but he was surprised that the man in the traditional Chinese dress wanted to show his determination to him.

Zhou Xu is eating everything, except for threats. He didn't even take out his staff. "Oh, how dare you!" Tak said disdainfully, looking at Zhou Xu, "This is something that the adventurers from Earth can't even touch. Come out and surrender, or I'll have to chase you down three or four times." "You know I can do it," Zhou Xu said.

The mages standing beside Tak, dressed in a white robe, looked down on Zhou Xu with a condescending gaze, barely even glancing at him. In their eyes, protecting Tak had already fulfilled their greatest responsibility.

Zhou Xu also understood why the other party didn't come to capture him, but instead was trying to psychologically attack him. Players usually use up all five revival stones before turning into a true corpse and dropping all their items. Before that, it's more practical to forcefully take away a player's items. However, if a player chooses to use the "burn to death" method of suicide, no one can stop them.

This is equivalent to a forced disconnection of projection, similar to when players get lost in the wilderness and return to the city to revive. Players generally revive near the town's cathedral, making it unrealistic to capture them there. This is also why Tak has been trying to pressure Zhou Xu to surrender the book from the beginning to now.

Zhou Xu took a closer look at the enemy's strength this time. The scene was indeed astonishing, with over 200 heavily armored knights, but he could be sure that the other party was not from the powerful mage families of Mistral, otherwise they would not be unaware of the significance of this mine.
Here is the translation of the text:

Not daring to touch Ernest's secret, the weak and feeble Church of Small Powers didn't even have the qualification to participate in the competition. "Let them go, I can go back with you," Zhao Xu thought to himself, still deciding to use the proof letter from the Mage Association to settle this matter. The identity badge in his hand would definitely be recognized by the few mages in front of him.

"Ah, what a naive person in this world," Tak said with a laugh, and the others around him also couldn't help but chuckle. After getting a forced smile from everyone, he felt quite satisfied.

"These merchants are silly, and so are you," he said. "They began by trying to deliver goods to Kasos and Brutus, but in reality, my family has already infiltrated and controlled those two cities. The city lords are just scapegoats. Without this achievement, I wouldn't dare to take the position of elder."

"So you know, when I saw this merchant team coming to deliver goods to me directly, I was extremely happy," he said with a laugh.

Suddenly, the clouds in the sky were unable to hold the pressure of the storm, and a torrential rain poured down, shattering the scenery of the entire southern forest. The original green landscape turned grayish, filled with mist and moisture.

This time, Zhao Xu didn't have time to put on his raincoat, and the whole person was soaked by the rain. His heart also became cold and numb.

He had already figured out why things didn't go smoothly in the end. It turned out that the initial direction was an error from the start. The fortune-teller from Moon Bay Town, who didn't need to think, was executed by internal forces.
The entire city of Caspian and the city of Brutania's independence has always been just a pawn used by powerful people to vie for power from the very beginning.

Each person who can make a move tries to bite off a piece of meat above.

"Why do you want to play with people's lives like this?"

Zhao Xu's heart had already become cold.

Heavy rain poured down on his face, flowing down his hair and into his official robe, but he didn't feel a hint of cold.

"It seems I need to show you what it means to play with lives."

Tark, standing far away, heard Zhao Xu's words and for the first time showed a cold, merciless smile.

The heavily armored knights who were escorting the smuggling merchant group suddenly drew out their long swords and stabbed at the already fallen and helpless merchant guards.

Like dominoes falling, the guards who had once spent over a week with Zhao Xu, even helping him carry things and set up tents, fell one by one and did not move again.

It was as if they had never been in this world.

Blood mixed with rainwater seeped into the earth.

The heavy rain pounded the ground, but could not stop the countless swords piercing hearts.

The huge wounds just harvested one after another.

Later, poets passing by could not imagine that this place had once buried the lives of dozens of people.

The trees that had grown tall and lush had once been watered.

The hanged man, already in a state of near-death, could only be conscious for a while and then fall unconscious again. The sounds of swords piercing and slashing around him had made him realize what was happening.

But now, he had no energy to grit his teeth or clench his jaw, and could only deeply regret his actions.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You're going to hell!" The poet finally opened his mouth, cursing angrily.

The group of players will be captured, and it's all because the Maple Leaf only has one last revival stone left, without thinking that the true death of the person who truly died, who knows that the NPCs in front of him are plotting something.

"I---" The poet's national curse was about to come out of his mouth, but he suddenly stopped, accidentally making the horseman who was about to shout unable to make a sound again.

As a result, the poet's life value directly dropped to -10 or below, and he instantly turned into a rainbow and vanished without leaving any remains.

At the same time, Yu Yao was also taken away by the sword that came with red eyes, still tied by the rope.

The wandering rainbow was unable to break free from the rope, and even the cloth in his mouth couldn't be removed. He was furious and shouted, "I'm going to file a complaint to the TC about these game NPCs, and ask them to delete the data!"

However, no one could hear him clearly, and he didn't even have the opportunity to say it before he followed the rainbow away.

"Are you satisfied? Mr. Zhong Xia, this is the gift I sent to you, as a return for the book you will give me later, please continue to enjoy it."

The young man, Tak, even laughed with a hoarse voice, with a face full of reckless and wild expressions.

Playing with what, there was no meaning to play with life.

Arthur once said that offending someone, there was no one more frightening than a wizard, because it was a grudge that spanned generations.

The scene just now seemed so long to Zhao Xu in his eyes.

But in reality, it only took an instant.

He was too late to stop it.

The proof document of the Moonlight Town, which had been soaked in the rain, was already crushed in Zhao Xu's hand.

Zhao Xu opened his eyes and looked ahead.
His entire body began to radiate extremely terrifying magical power. Anita's seal, which was the third method behind his back, was finally being unsealed by him. "Body Transformation!" Nine-level Arcana.
