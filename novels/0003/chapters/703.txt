Chapter 704: The Creation of the Giant Dragon

The mountains and rivers shattered, the gods' realm sank, and Zhao Xu remained composed.

Having witnessed the joys and sorrows of humanity, seeing the heavenly treasures right in front of him, and holding the mighty divine artifact that could destroy the heavens and the earth, Zhao Xu could be considered the supreme leader of the Earth's human forces.

Zhao Xu's experiences had tempered him to remain unchanged even when facing the crumbling of the mountains.

However, the words "Deep Abyss Lord" weighed heavily on him. Each character was as heavy as a thousand pounds, and even if he added Ernest's secrets, it would still be impossible to compare their weight.

He subconsciously turned his head away.

As someone with a 360-degree panoramic view, he still couldn't help but do so.

Until he was certain that there was no one else around him.

The "Deep Abyss Lord" referred to him, Zhao Xu.

But?

Was it true?

This position was unrelated to him, no matter how hard he stretched.

Zhao Xu was not the type of person who would feel complacent after receiving a gift from heaven. On the contrary, he would still waste a small piece of his time to carefully test the danger.

Zhao Xu's greatest lesson from his past life was that no matter what happened, he should not rush forward. What he ate might not be a big bread, but instead, it could be a bullet.

Zhao Xu thought to himself, "The most significant connection between me and the Deep Abyss might be this 'chaotic' camp?"

Even in his past life, he was a stalwart defender of order and justice, going so far as to become a police knight of the Arthurian legend. This was one of the reasons why he and Zheng Xin Yao were compatible, as their values aligned.
Here is the translation:

After the destruction of the town and the death of his family, he had to endure an unbearable burden of life and almost lost his faith. He then turned to the neutral good path. In order to avenge his family, he chose to ignore the rules. However, his ultimate bottom line was still goodness. After that, he embarked on a seven-year journey of revenge, constantly strengthening his warrior abilities and gaining experience like a veteran warrior. His camp gradually changed from good to chaotic good.

In the end, he returned to his original neutral good path. The connection between "you" and the abyss is essentially the relationship between the body and soul. According to fate, you should have reached this place after the legend. However, it seems that someone has interfered with your fate, so you arrived here ahead of time. Knowing the location of fate.

Zhao Xu's eyes narrowed slightly, "Who tampered with my fate?"

Suddenly, the name that had taken care of him a lot, and could be said to have protected him all along, jumped out - the magic goddess, Sylvina.

In the vast universe that seemed to have reached its end, a series of thunderous sounds echoed through the void.

The waves crashed against the shore, and the giant waves pounded against the cliff. The river flowed upwards, sweeping across the sky.

This reflected Zhao Xu's state of mind at the moment.

"Is it her?" Zhao Xu asked.

He knew that the person on the other side of the abyss would tell him.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the past, the magic goddess Sylvina led him to the awakening ceremony of "Magic Apprentice", and he underwent a journey back to the beginning of the millennium, where he encountered the then legendary wizard Sylvina herself, who was still a young girl.

According to the rumors, it was not him who needed the goddess, but the goddess who needed him.

This pawn should not have appeared on any chessboard, and yet it jumped out to influence the entire life line.

Now, he is the master of the abyss.

He has already become the "key player" of this world.

"No."

Suddenly, a response echoed through the void.

"That Sylvina lady, one of the strongest gods, can be said to be very close to the truth of fate, even more so than the goddess of pain."

"However, those who watch the flow of the river cannot change its direction, including that lady."

The opponent is very strong and may have even uncovered some historical truth.

But that's still not enough.

"Who is it then?"

"Is it Anniya?"

Zhou Xu continued to gaze at Anniya, a woman who was the key to his life, his mentor, and his soulmate.

Recalling his previous experiences with Anniya, he saw a flashback of their past moments together.

"It is and it is not."

The voice in the void continued to say.

You think you're the master, don't you? You think you can do it.

Zhou Xu suddenly felt a surge of frustration in his heart.

The boundless realm seemed to understand his thoughts and directly explained: "Anniya, miss, is waiting for another key moment in fate."

"As for the current abyss master, to her, it is very important, but it is not the reason she has been waiting for thousands of years."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's okay."
Zhao Xu couldn't help but take a deep breath.
Since that time he crossed over to the ancient era of King Arthur and saw the "Emperor Ernest" descend upon the land.
Zhao Xu was really worried.
If he was the reincarnation of "Emperor Ernest", the other party was waiting for him to revive from his body.
That was a bit too bloody.
"Can you really green yourself?"
"But is that so?" Zhao Xu's mind was shaken, and suddenly he realized that the other party was describing it in this way.
"What does this even mean?"
The void was a sigh that echoed through the ages, like a drumbeat resonating through the sky, with the reverberations falling back down layer by layer.
"This is something I cannot answer."
"Then let's go back."
Zhao Xu's expression became extremely solemn, "Who is it that led me here beforehand?"
The Lord of the Abyss.
It's not a good position, no matter how you look at it.
Human kingdoms and succession disputes are all filled with bloodshed. The Abyss also has so many lords, and it's a chaotic era.
Especially, he now knows this point, and it's no longer a secret.
However, the existence that broke through Zhao Xu's spiritual barrier is not few.
Does this mean that this message cannot be hidden for long?
If so, Zhao Xu might directly become a thorn in the eyes of the Abyss, as well as countless creatures and gods!
He must take action quickly.
This world cannot tolerate another existence like "Emperor Ernest".
This chaotic situation, where the strong rise and the weak fall, allows everyone to occupy their own small patch of land and dig it up from the earth to eat.
Here is the translation of the text:

If a "strong one" appears, he will devour everything weak and small, just like a large fish in a snake's belly, slowly absorbing everything and converting it into his own part. Ultimately, he will achieve the ultimate goal of dominating everything.

This is the greatest historical lesson that Ernest left for Arthur and all the gods.

Don't let another strong one who can notify Arthur appear again.

"That existence is probably familiar to you."
"In the future, you will all represent the purest chaos. Therefore, you will meet each other. As a result, the chaos within your body will be released prematurely, and the river of fate will no longer be able to block it."
"In other words, when you step into any portal in the abyss, regardless of where it is."
"You will all be transported to this place."
"This is the will of the abyss, and it is also your will."

At this moment, the boundless realm slowly takes the form of a vague, ethereal human-like figure, resembling an old man with white hair, slightly bending his knees and waist, with a servant-like posture.

As he listened to the other's words, Zhao Xu's brain flashed with a thought.

Even if Anzhiya had warned him that in searching for Lark, it was best not to think about the person - Nayaratip, who lived in a terrifying, nameless world, and was terrified of encountering him.

The other's nature is the nameless chaos.

Similar to what is in front of him, he also represents the chaos and represents the "abyss" of chaos.

The other's behavior, however, is also a perfect "devil".

All the circles are closed at this moment.

"I understand," Zhao Xu nodded slightly.
Here is the translation:

"So, you're saying that I can take back the power of the Abyssal Lord and control the entire Abyss? By doing so, I can dominate the entire Abyss?"

Zhou Xu's eyes flickered slightly.

He had never intervened in the management of the entire Nalan, even waiting quietly for development. The main reason was that Nalan needed rest and cultivation. It wouldn't be able to help him at all for several years or even a decade, not to mention cultivating enough adventure teams before that.

However, the Abyss was different. It was like a magical USB stick that could be inserted and removed at will, with a huge storage capacity.

"I'm sorry," said the elderly being, bowing his head slightly towards Zhou Xu. "Please allow me to tell you about your past as the Abyssal Lord. After you've heard it, you'll naturally understand everything and won't have any more doubts about grasping the Abyss."

The elderly being's posture was impeccable and dignified, a perfect coordination that even the royal etiquette masters of the Arthurian Empire couldn't match.

"You said you'd listen with an open mind," Zhou Xu nodded.

"Compared to that, have you heard the myth of the legendary dragons?" the elderly being smiled.

Zhou Xu didn't notice himself nodding.

What's more, he seemed to suspect that there was a profound connection between his "latent potential" and that.

In fact, even the "giant Arthurian dragon crystal mine" at the bottom of the wilderness was now in the planning stage.

After the great storm that shrouded Arthur's world, the entire mining plan would be launched.

Additionally, he also had the expertise of "Dragon Seer", which was related to the rumors of the "Dragon Prophecy" that represented the ultimate truth of the world.

It was rumored that magic was derived from the residual echoes of the Dragon Prophecy.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I know that the giant dragon Arthur sacrificed his life to clear the cosmic mist. The massive dragon body also transformed into the material plane of the world."

Strictly speaking, the dragon Arthur is equivalent to the primordial giant Pangu who created the world.

However, after countless years of history, few people know this point, not even Zhao Xu, who only learned about Arthur's name origin later.

"Don't you know, the original creator dragon had at least three?"

One stone stirring up a thousand waves!
Three?

Zhao Xu felt that he had a hazy impression, but couldn't quite recall it.

It was as if the Mandela effect had turned his memories into a chaotic mess.

"Are the other two?" Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

As he spoke, countless mysterious diagrams fluttered in his mind, transforming into butterflies.

The ancient being, who had transcended the boundaries of the world, smiled slightly, "The other two are the serpent dragons - chaos and order."
"They are like two snakes, head to tail, tail to head, connected to each other, maintaining the stability of the entire Arthur world. However, before the creator dragon Arthur died, he made a plea to these two creator dragons."

"Plea?" Zhao Xu was slightly astonished.

"No mistake," the old man's gaze finally revealed a glimmer of sharpness.

"The two serpent dragons represent the complete cycle of life and energy, forever revolving, with birth and death intertwined. Adding the power of order and chaos, it's as if the world's strongest magnet is firmly attracting all scattered energy."

"So the existence of these two creator serpent dragons represents that the entire Arthur world will forever remain in a state of absolute lifelessness, until the world is destroyed."

"They don't die, and all things will not be reborn."

"They don't perish, and the heavens and earth cannot continue the cycle."
Here is the translation of the text:

This mythological story's content has shockingly affected Zhao Xu.

It's simply extraordinary, like the direct connection between heaven and earth, the greatest thief.

He waved his hand, then asked, "So, what?"

"So, the creator of the world, Arthur, before his death, made a plea - to sacrifice his life and abandon himself. As long as the ring-shaped structure of the twin snakes is destroyed, the power will be released."

"The world will then have order and chaos, life and death, and all binary opposing existences."

"With Arthur as the intermediate support point, everything will evolve into three, and all things will be created."

—Ah—

Zhao Xu took a deep breath.

He didn't even need to say more; he had already imagined the outcome.

It was inevitable that there would be a split!

"Who agreed and who refused?" Zhao Xu asked.

The old man sighed, "The creator of the world, the order dragon, refused this point, but the creator of chaos, the twin snakes, based on their nature, agreed."

"It thinks that if things continue as they are, the world will be a stable and unchanging state. Only diversity can be the essence of chaos."

"The structure of the twin snakes, as long as one of them is opened, cannot continue."

"In the end, order and chaos fell. At the same time, the energy and elemental forces they consumed continued to evolve Arthur's multiple aspects, including positive and negative energies and elemental aspects, which were born at that time."

Zhao Xu nodded, "I should be that chaotic dragon, also known as the current abyssal lord. And what about the order dragon?"

The old man smiled.
"Asmotiel, the lord of the nine hells."
