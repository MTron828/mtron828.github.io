Chapter 070: The Path of Return

Zhao Xu stood in the city of Fēng Fēng, feeling familiar with the bustling commercial city without any magical aura.

This was more like the world where the Arthurian people lived.

Fēng Fēng was a crucial hub city located north of the Tian Du Mountain Range.

This city, said to have been destroyed by the legendary wizard using storm magic, had been rebuilt over the past century and had become a thriving metropolis.

Every day, countless merchant caravans departed from or returned to the city, transporting goods for the "North of Heaven Alliance" that governed dozens of towns.

However, after feeling familiar, Zhao Xu still felt a headache when looking at the map of the entire Tian Du Mountain Range region in his hand.

Anniya had given him a simple task:

She had sent Zhao Xu from the south of the Tian Du Mountain Range, Mí Sī Tǎ, to the north, Fēng Fēng.

She wanted him, as a 1st-level character, to return to the magical capital, Mí Sī Tǎ, without using teleportation.

The distance between the two cities was over a hundred li when measured directly, and the risk of crossing the Tian Du Mountain Range was enormous.

Even with the power of the "North of Heaven Alliance", a safe route had not yet been opened.

Zhao Xu estimated that it would take him half a month to return to Mí Sī Tǎ, and he would likely have leveled up to 2nd-level wizard by then, and another profession could also be advanced to the level of a scholar.

In the last six years of his previous life, Zhao Xu had participated in countless outdoor adventures and had no concerns about his experience.

The only question was, his life value and error tolerance were not yet sufficient.

After leveling up to a priest, Zhao Xu's life die had changed to D6, although it was still inferior to the traditional priest's D8 but was still sufficient for a wizard's D4.
Here is the translation of the text:

He now has 8 HP, a significant increase of 2 points, and his back has stiffened by 2 degrees.

Legend has it that even a 1-HP mage like King Arthur dares to roam freely, as others have the capital to resist various forms of damage.

As for Zhao Xu, with 8 HP, not to mention taking a round of concentrated fire in the wild, just a slight ripple can make him create a sacred temple.

However, death is also another way for Zhao Xu to complete his task, as he will revive in Mistral after death.

But this way, he may not receive any good rewards afterwards, and his leveling progress will be greatly delayed.

After some thought, Zhao Xu still carried his Howard bag and walked towards the North Secret Alley.

The information panel on Zhao Xu's character card is now displaying the latest information.

【Adventurer Summer is conducting a "Knowledge" check for the Mender 's "Scholarship", with a result of 1 (Mender) + 3 (Intelligence) + D20 = 1 + 3 + 8 = 12, exceeding the difficulty DC10, and obtaining "General Folklore". Specifically, it is as follows......】

As for the Mender, compared to traditional Menders, they are weak in martial arts and strong in culture.

"Knowledge" is a unique ability of the Mender, similar to the "Wandering Knowledge" of the wandering poet, Zhao Xu's knowledge skill level is low, and more inclined to specific problems.

Therefore, it is more convenient to directly understand local legends through "Knowledge" rather than trying to find out through rumors.

He will soon find the most convenient destination through those general rumors.

The location of the North Secret Alley is very secluded, with adjacent buildings and a lack of direct sunlight, and the ground is slightly damp.

Several rough-looking people stood chatting at the street corner, glanced at Zhao Xu's outfit, and then ignored him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only Zhao Xu's target was them, and he walked straight up to them and whispered, "I need a ticket to go to 'Nan Du'."

Nan Du refers to the Magic City of Mistral in the local dialect of the Flickering City.

One of the high-ranking officials, dressed in a hemp shirt and looking down on Zhao Xu, said, "What's your background?"

"A mage, take me to see your leader," Zhao Xu replied calmly.

The onlookers' condescending attitude suddenly froze, and the official with the lowered brow said, "This esteemed guest, please follow me."

Zhao Xu didn't say much and followed him.

As they returned to the town of ordinary people, Zhao Xu's past experiences began to come in handy again.

He was no longer like facing An Xueying, but had become a thoroughly trained student.

These people dressed as beggars, but Zhao Xu judged from their appearance that they were mostly ordinary people who had not received professional training, or in other words, first-class citizens.

Not even the lowest-level warrior could compare.

Warriors were already a watered-down version of soldiers.

Unable to become a soldier, they would turn to a lower-level warrior, which was the ecological niche of the broadest population of ordinary people.

Zhao Xu estimated that it took about ten minutes to arrive at a lively tavern, which was also the headquarters of the secret underground forces led by Caesar.

When going upstairs, Zhao Xu estimated the surroundings and found that the environment was perfectly set up.

However, Zhao Xu was not familiar with this place, so he would naturally estimate the escape route.

He had three tricks given to him by An Xueying in his backpack, each of which would deduct once on use.

But it wouldn't be convenient, and he would use them without hesitation.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

Caesar, who was sitting and chatting with his friends, heard the report from his subordinate and sat up straight, taking a moment to scrutinize Zhao Xu. "Are you going to Nan Du?" he asked.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly.

"Earth players?" Caesar's eyes flickered with recognition. It was common for people to refer to these Earth adventurers as "players" after a month of exposure.

Zhao Xu's aura made Caesar hesitate for a moment, as if he was thinking that Zhao Xu was one of the native inhabitants of Arthur.

"No mistake," Zhao Xu replied.

The players had not yet intervened too deeply in the forces, and many forces liked to assign players to be mercenaries. It was a lucrative business, and they were not afraid of death.

"Ah, Earth players, you should know the current situation in Tian Nan Mountain," Caesar said.

"I know that the two towns at the foot of the mountain are trying to secede from the Commerce Alliance, and most of the regular merchants have given up on crossing Tian Nan Mountain in recent times. That's also why I came to find you," Zhao Xu explained.

At this point, only these underground forces' smuggling teams dared to risk crossing Tian Nan Mountain.

Only they were not afraid of the dark, and dared to bring outsiders with them.

"It seems you've also done your research. Mr. Mage, are you willing to pay a large price for this ticket?" Caesar thought for a moment before speaking.

As Zhao Xu, who had once been a chief of police in his past life, had killed many heads of these underground forces on the spot, he had a significant psychological advantage.

If he really needed to negotiate, he could even turn around and collect a protection fee.

However, all these were external matters. What was more important to him was reaching Mistral.

"When we encounter battles, I'll join in and provide magical support. However, if the situation is unfavorable, I'll also withdraw from the battle."
Here is the translation of the text:

When Caesar heard the other party's words, he relaxed his mind, which was exactly his bottom line. It was not difficult to flip the table and kill that mage, but the subsequent trouble was too big. A few days ago, a habitual thief from the neighboring power stole a player's wallet and was discovered by the opponent. The leader of the thieves immediately gathered his men to chase away a few players. Who knew that that female adventurer was able to gather dozens of adventurers from various professions to surround and kill the thief organization. It was a hot topic in the entire secret alley, with players turning pale with fear. They were there to make money, not to cause trouble. "The few adventurers from Earth who came down to the bar were also going to Nan Du, I think you're probably the same identity as them. Let's join them and take action together."
