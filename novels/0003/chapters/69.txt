Chapter 070: The Road Back

Zhou Xu, standing in the stormy city, felt a sense of familiarity with the bustling commercial city without any magical aura.

This was more like the world where the Arthurian people lived.

The stormy city was a crucial hub located north of the Tian Duan Mountains.

This city, which was said to have been destroyed by the legendary wizard using storm magic, had been rebuilt for nearly a century and was now thriving.

Every day, countless merchant teams departed or returned to the city, transporting goods from the entire "Tianbei Commerce Alliance" under its jurisdiction.

However, after feeling a sense of familiarity, Zhou Xu looked at the map of the entire Tian Duan Mountains region in his hand and still felt a slight headache.

Annie gave him a simple task:

She sent Zhou Xu from Mistralla, south of the Tian Duan Mountains, to the stormy city north of the mountains.

She asked him, a 1st-level character, to return to Mistralla, the city of magic, without using teleportation.

The distance between the two great cities was over a hundred miles, not to mention the huge risk of crossing the Tian Duan Mountains.

Even with the power of the "Tianbei Commerce Alliance", a safe route had not yet been opened.

Zhou Xu estimated that it would take him half a month to return to Mistralla, by which time he would have leveled up to 2nd-level wizard and another profession could also be upgraded.

In the last six years of his previous life, Zhou Xu had participated in countless outdoor adventures, and he wasn't worried about his experience.

The only question was that his life value and error tolerance were not enough.

After leveling up to a monk, Zhou Xu's life dice had changed to D6, which was lower than the traditional monk's D8, but still superior to the wizard's D4.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's current HP is 8, which has increased by 2 points. His backbone has also become harder by 2 points. The legendary mage is not afraid of Arthur's onslaught because he has the capital to resist various forms of damage. With his 8 HP, even if he were to receive a round of fire in the wilderness, just a slight ripple would be enough to let him create a holy temple.

However, death is also one of Zhao Xu's ways to complete his mission. After all, he will be reborn in Mistral. However, this may not bring him any good rewards, and it may significantly delay his level-up progress.

After thinking for a while, Zhao Xu still carried his Howard backpack and headed towards the secret alley in the north of the city.

On the information panel of Zhao Xu's character card, the latest information is now displayed.

"Adventurer Zhao Xu is investigating the 'Knowledge' of a mendicant priest. The result is 1 (priest) + 3 (intelligence) + D20 = 12, exceeding the difficulty DC10, and obtaining 'general rumors and legends'."

The mendicant priest is weaker in martial arts than traditional priests but stronger in culture.

"Knowledge" is a unique ability of the mendicant priest, similar to the "逸闻知识" of a wandering poet. Zhao Xu's knowledge skill level is low, and he tends to focus on specific questions.

Therefore, he can quickly understand the local legends through this ability.

He immediately gained insight into the general rumors and quickly figured out where he should go.

The secret alley in the north of the city is a secluded area with buildings tightly packed together, with no direct sunlight and a slightly damp floor.

A few rough-looking people stood at the entrance, chatting and glanced at Zhao Xu's clothing before losing interest.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu's target was actually them. He walked straight up to them and asked in a low voice, "I need a ticket to 'Nan Du'."

Nan Du is located in the Whirlwind City, which is also known as the Magic City of Mistralla.

Mistralla is too famous, and ordinary people dare not mention its true name easily.

One of the leaders, a tall and thin man wearing a linen robe, looked at Zhao Xu's robe and sneered, "What's your stake?"

Zhao Xu replied calmly, "The spellcaster, take me to see your leader."

The surrounding people's condescending attitude suddenly froze, and the leader's brows furrowed as he said, "This dignified person, please follow me."

Zhao Xu didn't say much and followed him.

As they returned to the city of ordinary people, Zhao Xu's past experiences began to come in handy again.

He was no longer like facing An Ti Nia, and he was now just a well-trained student.

These people dressed as bandits, and Zhao Xu judged from their physical appearance that they were mostly ordinary people who had not received professional training, that is, level one civilians.

Not even a basic level one warrior was qualified.

Warriors had already become a weakened version of warriors.

They couldn't become warriors and instead became level one warriors, which was the ecological environment of the masses.

Zhao Xu walked for about 10 minutes and arrived at a lively tavern, which was also the headquarters of the secret underground forces of Caesar.

As he went upstairs, Zhao Xu estimated the surroundings and found that there were clearly set up sentries and guards.

However, Zhao Xu, who was not familiar with this place, thought it was better to plan an escape route.

He had three tricks given to him by An Ti Nia, and each time he used one would deduct once from the reward.

But in reality, he would not hesitate to use them.
Here is the translation of the text:

Caesar, who was sitting in a corner chatting with his friends, straightened up slightly after hearing the report from his subordinate. He looked at Zhao Xuan and asked, "Are you going to Nan Du?"

Zhao Xuan nodded.

Caesar's expression changed slightly, and he seemed to think that Zhao Xuan was one of the locals. "Not wrong," Zhao Xuan said.

As for the current situation, the players had not yet intervened heavily in the forces, and many forces liked to assign players to be mercenaries. They were willing to risk their lives and were very profitable.

"Ah, you Earth players should know the current situation in Tian Nan Mountain," Caesar said.

"I know that the two towns at the foot of the northern mountain are trying to secede from the commercial alliance, and most of the regular commercial travelers have given up on crossing Tian Nan Mountain in recent times. That's why I came to find you," Zhao Xuan said.

At this time, only the underground forces' smuggling teams were brave enough to cross Tian Nan Mountain. They were not afraid of darkness and were willing to bring outsiders along.

"It seems you've already heard about this, Mr. Practitioner," Caesar thought for a moment before speaking.

As a former justice official in his previous life, Zhao Xuan had dealt with underground forces many times and had killed over three people on the spot. With his current backpack containing a trump card, he had a significant psychological advantage. If he really wanted to negotiate, he could even collect a protection fee.

However, all these were external matters. What was more important to him was reaching Mistral.

"When we encounter battles, I will join and provide magical support. However, if the situation is not right, I will also withdraw from the battle."
Here is the translation of the text:

When Caesar heard the other party's words, he relaxed his mind, which was his bottom line. It's not difficult to surround and kill this mage, but the trouble that follows is too great.

A few days ago, the traitor from the neighboring faction secretly stole a player's wallet, and the victim discovered it. On the spot, the thief's leader gathered his men to chase away the few players.

Who knew that the female adventurer could gather dozens of adventurers with various professions to surround and kill the thief organization. It made the entire secret passage talk about the players' predicament.

They are here to earn money, not to cause trouble. "The few adventurers from the Earth also want to go to the Southern City, I think you are also of the same identity, come back and join them, and we'll act together."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, likely in a fantasy world, discussing a plan to deal with a thief organization.
