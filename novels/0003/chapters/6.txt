Chapter 7: The City of Magic

"Players, please complete 0-2 defect selection. This defect cannot be erased. Please be cautious when selecting or giving up selection."

The system's prompt tone was quite urgent, as if this entire thing shouldn't exist in the first place.

Zhao Xuyu's eyes slowed down and appeared to focus on the defect options.

Fortunately, the four surrounding ladders were already enveloped in white light, or else people with acrophobia wouldn't be able to choose.

Zhao Xuyu's attention was drawn to the digits at the bottom right corner.

10.
9.
8.
7.

Even Zhao Xuyu's laziness reacted to the fact that this was the countdown for defect selection, and the system had opened up in a stealthy manner, giving him a very limited time to make a choice. Not to mention that the system didn't even mention what the specific benefits were.

Adding to the system's ambiguous tone, it sounded like you wouldn't lose out even if you didn't choose anything.

"'Easy to get hurt.'"
"'Civil servant.'"

Zhao Xuyu didn't have the energy to re-read the entire text, and he only managed to find two defects related to close combat in the list.

【Easy to get hurt: You're not good at protecting yourself.
Effect: Your defense -1 level.】
【Civil servant: You're completely not good at using close combat.
Effect: All your close combat attacks -2 level】

After the countdown officially ended, the entire defect system list had disappeared.

On Zhao Xuyu's personal panel, only the descriptions of the two defects he had just selected were left, placed in the special skills list—

Special skills (Human race reward): To be determined
Special skills (1st level): To be determined
Special skills (Defect 1): To be determined
Special skills (Defect 2): To be determined
Here is the translation of the text:

Arthur's character specialty is usually completed through vocational training, and if a person does not choose a human race, they do not have the perseverance and luck to open the system.

So, just considering the number of specialties, the opponent is three points behind Zhao Xu.

As previously said by the great master, specialty is the ability to freely choose.

He has three more abilities than others.

As for the consequences of the defect, Zhao Xu thought for a moment and still accepted it.

AC actually refers to the defense value, with each person born with a fixed 10-point defense value, which is then added to various bonuses such as agility adjustments.

The player's attack power is their basic attack value, combined with a series of bonuses such as strength adjustments.

Zhao Xu, a 5th-level warrior from his past life, reached the 5th level of attack power after adding 4 points of strength adjustment to the 4th level, so his attack power is 9 levels.

Arthur uses the D20 system, where D20 is a 20-sided die roll, representing a number between 1 and 20.

Similarly, D6 is a six-sided die roll representing a number.

3D6 represents the sum of three six-sided die rolls.

Zhao Xu chose a defect, sacrificing attack and defense, and had a rather late-stage idea.

Slowly, Zhao Xu began to realize that he had lost his senses and was surrounded by a haze, as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.

Zhao Xu suddenly woke up, finding himself wearing a linen robe and standing on a stone road, with the sun already at noon. However, he was enveloped by a dark shadow, as if there was a giant cloud in the air.

Zhao Xu carefully observed his surroundings, finding that most of the people were Arthur's original inhabitants, with a few curious onlookers who looked at him like he was a stranger.
Here is the translation of the text:

On the main street, it was surprisingly clean, but covered in various mysterious symbols that he couldn't understand. Meanwhile, the information panel below his character card was constantly updating. The character card and information panel are auxiliary tools for each Arthur player, recording the real-time character cards and various dynamic information. The hints on the panel read:

"Hint 1: Please follow the introduction letter in your package and enroll in the wizard training course at the Magic Academy in this town to complete your formal vocational training."
"Hint 2: Please follow the introduction letter in your package and enroll in the clergy training course at the Holy Shrine in this town to complete your formal vocational training. (Recommended: Sisylvia Shrine)"

At this moment, Zhao Xu also realized that his backpack indeed contained some items.

At this time, many players in the Arthur world had already chosen their professions and were walking around the city. There was no concept of a "newbie village" in Arthur, only cities and villages. Most players were already stationed in the cities, with only a few having access to complete sets of professional associations and training facilities.

In other words, the system was currently arranging for players to participate in these training programs, and those who wanted to join these programs would have to pay the price. If they didn't have the money, they would have to sign a contract and complete the training, after which they would have to provide services to the associations for a certain period of time.

What was even more realistic was that these towns where they were born were actually real, and after the mass migration, everyone felt that the NPCs in this town were just like them, living and breathing. However, Zhao Xu couldn't bring himself to face this reality.
Here is the translation:

These towns are all real places in the world of Arthur, not just copied and pasted from a beginner's village, so he knows the layout of the Winter City he used to inhabit, but is unclear about where he is now. Not to mention where he needs to go for training.

Looking at the towering city walls in the distance, it's clear that this isn't a small place. He took out the two letters from his backpack. The recommendation letter explains where this is.

Zhao Xu has 3 intelligence adjustment points, so he is naturally gifted in speaking three languages, without needing to actually learn them, just going through the motions. He doesn't understand, but the system will automatically translate for him. After crossing over, these language memories are actually infused into each person's mind.

Among the Arthurian interfaces, the "common language" shared by billions of species is mainly locked by the system and does not occupy a quota. The remaining three quotas will be automatically learned by him later.

Ordinary people usually have only one recommendation letter, but Zhao Xu has two because of his special dual-elite profession.

He smiled as he unfolded the parchment, looking at where he was.

"Mistral." A few words flashed before his eyes, and Zhao Xu's hands shook involuntarily.

Mistral, the land of the magic goddess, where magic dominates everything.

Zhao Xu suddenly understood the shadow beneath his feet came from where he was. He directly raised his head.

It was a city of floating magic towers suspended in the air.
