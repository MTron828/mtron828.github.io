Chapter 274: The Abyss Entrance

The next morning, Zhao Xu was notified by Ana Toniya that his audit had been approved. However, before he entered, the association sent a special team to brief him on the details of the "Carrion Beast Abyss" and recent changes. They also brought him some unfortunate news.

The association had informed Zhao Xu that the Half-Face had evolved again in the early hours of the previous night, and anyone who entered would be affected by the "Mage Disintegration Technique". Therefore, the association had prepared 5-level or lower magical items and scrolls for Zhao Xu to abandon. Even Zhao Xu himself could not bring his basic backpack or Howard's convenience bag.

After reconfirming the risks with Zhao Xu, the association officials handed him a temporary teleportation key.

Zhao Xu, facing the new rules that had appeared overnight, had to entrust all his magical items to Ana Toniya. This was his first experience of realizing that everything was false and only his own strength could ensure everything.

Originally, a divine artifact was a heavy-duty shield against the "Mage Disintegration Technique". Unfortunately, the Half-Face itself had fragments of the God of Death, so Ana Toniya did not provide Zhao Xu with a divine artifact.

Even Lakshmi, who had been her younger brother, was not a problem. Zhao Xu dared to bring Lakshmi along.

After saying hello to Ana Toniya, Zhao Xu directly activated the one-time "Teleportation Key" in his hand.

At this moment, the key to the Half-Face suddenly burst into light, sweeping Zhao Xu in.

Finally, when Zhao Xu opened his eyes, he found himself in a dense forest. Even the sunlight filtered through the leafy trees and fell on his cloak. The entrance to the "Flesh-eating Beast Mine" was hidden in this forest.

"If you're coming through my words, you're probably going straight to the mine," said the master. "But relying on these people's words, it's probably a remarkable feat to get here."

At this moment, the sunlight filtering through the trees fell on Zhao Xu's body. According to the Association personnel, the forest Zhao Xu saw was actually a hallucination, an expansion of his mind.

It was only after the "Flesh-eating Beast Mine" that the true half-face adventure route began, and Wang Qingwei and Esvegni were currently trapped inside. Zhao Xu was vigilant, looking around his surroundings, which was not just a pure waiting for an enemy's attack.

Rather, the forest itself could be arranged, and any special power threats could appear at any time, which was normal.

"Raksha, if you're lost, I'll cast a spell or start searching myself," said Zhao Xu.

"Yes, master, go straight ahead to the right front, towards the tallest tree, and the 'Flesh-eating Beast Mine' should be there, I can sense the aura," said Raksha.

When he heard this, Zhao Xu nodded and started walking straight ahead towards the right front.

This place was called the "Flesh-eating Beast Mine" because this half-face started to raise "Flesh-eating Beasts" at the beginning, as their bodies were made of key important magical materials.

However, after the appearance of replaceable magical materials, this flesh-eating beast breeding base was abandoned.

As time went by, this place gradually became a prison for the once mighty nation.

One day, this half-world prison welcomed the future Grim Reaper, and it became famous for a while.

"Master, I heard that if you experience the cruel punishment that the Grim Reaper experienced in that underground city, you can get the reward of 'Iron Will'," Lacis said to Zhao Xiu.

"Lacis, those association members just told me that this is not 100% true. Moreover, those cruel punishments are too harsh. It's unnecessary," Zhao Xiu said.

Zhao Xiu's pace was not slow, and he kept walking through the forest and sometimes stopped at stone bridges and streams.

The whole process was very calm and peaceful, and finally Zhao Xiu noticed a cave entrance with an open door. He stopped immediately.

Zhao Xiu walked closer to take a look.

But he found that the entrance was blocked by a mysterious incantation.

"It seems to be the password to enter the cave," Lacis said.

Zhao Xiu nodded, and the password was naturally a string of content that he could recite smoothly.

The incantation in front of him was a jumbled mess, and naturally Zhao Xiu had to decipher it.

Zhao Xiu immediately started combining and processing the content of the incantation in his mind.

As the association members said, different people meet different difficulties. Some have no idea what they're facing, and some are on the verge of death.

Compared to Zhao Xiu, who was just deciphering a password, he was extremely "merciful".

However, if he couldn't decipher it, it meant he would be cut off and unable to enter the space.
Here is the translation of the text:

Slowly, Zhao Xu also furrowed his brow, using various common encryption and decryption methods to handle the mysterious phrase in his mind, but the result was meaningless.

"Master, what's going on?" Larkss sensed Zhao Xu's furrowed brow and asked.

"I didn't intentionally pay attention to encrypting the curse before, and my understanding of this area is mostly limited to deciphering arcane texts," Zhao Xu said.

"Hey, Master, I still understand a lot about curse encryption, and I can learn it quickly, right?" Larkss asked.

"Yes," Zhao Xu replied.

As he responded, Larkss began to silently recite the specific encryption content in his mind.

After about a minute, Zhao Xu directly said: "The next method is wrong."

This sudden reaction startled Larkss, and she asked: "Master, I haven't finished deciphering the entire thought process, how do you know it's wrong?"

Larkss was still confident in her own memory, so she was puzzled by Zhao Xu's sudden reaction.

Zhao Xu, on the other hand, shook his head and said, "The 'Caboso' encryption method you just recited is using the substitution method, but no matter how you substitute, the original 173-character curse will have parts that are simply preserved. I randomly generated over 100 combinations, but none of them made sense, so this method shouldn't be."

At this point, Larkss finally realized Zhao Xu's true intellectual strength.

Zhao Xu didn't wait for her to finish before starting to understand and think about the encryption method; instead, he began to directly apply it from the start, even completing some complex calculations in his mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

She slowly recited the corresponding incantation encryption methods, and this time she memorized them more precisely. Even other low-level mages listening here would feel confused and unable to understand what Laksis was doing.

However, after Laksis finished reciting the 23 common encryption methods, Zhao Xu still didn't reveal which spell he was referring to.

"Lords?" Laksis asked tentatively.

"They're all garbled," Zhao Xu said.

Laksis' expression turned incredulous, "Lord, did you just complete all of them? So quickly?"

"Yes," Zhao Xu didn't seem to care about Laksis' tone, and his gaze shifted back to the incantation on the door.

"Probably double encryption," Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

"This? It's too much of a hassle," Laksis complained even more.

This meant that the incantation on the stone door was first encrypted using one method, and then re-encrypted to obtain the second encrypted text. As a result, the original text itself was garbled and couldn't produce meaningful content.

With the initial 23 encryption methods, Laksis could combine them in various ways to exceed 400 double-encryption methods.

"Yes, Lord, how about we divide 200 of them and work together? You shouldn't underestimate Laksis, I was once a prodigy in arithmetic calculations."

"Not necessary," Zhao Xu suddenly walked up and directly touched the incantation with his hand, then whispered another incantation.

Suddenly, the stone door, which had been filled with death energy, began to slowly open from top to bottom, emitting a low-pitched humming sound.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah? Master, are you 30-40 years old in terms of intelligence? You've just instantly calculated all 400 encryption methods?"

Lakshmi was shocked.

"Don't be ridiculous, Lakshmi. Isn't there a rule that says it takes no more than five steps? So I first selected the 16 encryption methods with a depth of less than five layers, even if I had to encrypt myself again. Then I tried the fourth one and it was cracked."

Lakshmi finally understood, and Zhao Xu had indeed calculated the 400 encryption methods. Choosing the 16 methods that conform to the "no more than five steps" principle was completely reasonable.

At this moment, Zhao Xu looked down at the dark corridor below, and directly took a step forward. Only two steps later, the stone door behind him had silently closed.

Suddenly, countless torches of flame erupted directly above the corridor walls. A faint, shadowy figure appeared at the end of the corridor.
