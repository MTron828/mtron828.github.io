Chapter 674: Rescue

As the cannibal wizard shouted, the two horns on his head began to wobble, as if they were about to burst forth. He gazed at the crowd with a cold and ruthless expression, making his words seem entirely sincere.

The people in the small team heard these words and were already displaying tears in their eyes.

They looked up, but saw no glimmer of hope. Even if there was some, it was blocked by the overwhelming numerical disparity.

At this moment, the team of over ten people was surrounded by an endless army of cannibal monsters, with flying dragons swooping down from the sky, as if they were about to snatch a target at any moment.

"Ahh!"

Someone couldn't help but let out a cry of surprise, because they had seen the same Earth-crossers as themselves among the cannibal monsters.

Most people were expressionless, with their hands tightly bound by rope, being dragged behind the cannibal monsters like slaves of old. Some had been worn out by the ordeal, with their clothes torn apart.

Those who had resisted capture were now crawling on the ground, their backs covered in iron wires. They had lost all movement.

As for those who had fainted from the pain and were being dragged on the ground, their human weight was negligible to the cannibal monsters, who were at least 21 times stronger. It was no longer about imprisoning prisoners, but rather transporting livestock.

As Zhao Xu saw this dismal scene, he clenched his fist tightly.

The members of the same small team were biting their teeth, unable to imagine this desolate scene. Those who had once lived a comfortable life on Earth found it hard to fathom this bleak reality.
Here is the translation of the text:

They also understand that the reason why there are so many demon armies emerging is that they are determined to capture them all in the process of continuous pursuit, leaving no one alive.

Zheng Xin'an also looks somewhat disbelieving, as if he finds it hard to accept.

Initially, the undead waves were just simple massacres, and they would not resort to such cruel methods of torture.

In fact, in this desolate land, countless unseen corners are repeating a similar scenario.

Even Arthur, who had stepped through the veil, is constantly replaying this gruesome scene.

But back then, they were playing the role of saviors, wielding justice like a mighty fist, rescuing the suffering civilians.

The captives were only ordinary civilians under Arthur's command.

Because once the players fail to capture the enemy, they can only die on the spot, using a revive stone to escape. Trying to escape with such a trick is not worth the effort.

But now, under the premise that life cannot be relived.

The instinct to survive is the greatest primal urge controlling every person's body.

"Just now, your threat, I can understand as a desperate reaction after losing the sacred artifact. After all, without a fierce warning, no one would take themselves seriously."

Zhao Xu at this moment slightly lowers his head, but his words are merciless.

Compared to just now, he had thought of allowing Xin'an to show off his skills, wondering how to communicate with the evil, incommunicable beings.

But now, he has been enraged.

The teammates beside him are worriedly looking at him, but dare not make a sound.

"Ha, ignorant humans."

The demon sorcerer sneers, shaking his head, "You cannot understand the significance of that sacred artifact to my tribe!"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Moreover, because of your recent rebuttal, I have decided to take the initiative."

"Remember, your companion is forever injured and disabled because of your loose talk, and will never be able to walk again."

As soon as the words were spoken, all the people in the scene turned pale with shock, and their eyes were filled with sympathy as they looked at Allow's expression.

This punishment of entangling companions is inevitable, even if they can eventually escape. This young man will definitely be haunted by guilt for the rest of his life.

Haha.

Zhao Xu had finally realized that he had underestimated the fanaticism of the believers.

The premise of exchange is mutual respect. By stealing someone else's belongings, he had lost the opportunity for exchange from the very beginning.

The other party could explain to him, but in essence, it was asking him to return the "sacred object" and put pressure on the small team that had stolen it.

Because these captured players all have friends and family, this force will form a pressure that will weigh down on that small team.

It is clear that the one who committed the evil deed was the flesh-eating demon, but because the small team had stolen the sacred object of the monster, they would be condemned by their companions. People would blame them as the initiators of everything.

This is the biggest truth in this world of the strong devouring the weak.

"Go, chop off her leg," the flesh-eating witch said without waiting for Zhao Xu to think about it.

The moment the words were spoken, the flesh-eating demon who had been standing beside Allow suddenly raised the giant axe in his hand, with the curved edge still smeared with blood.

The people in the small team all almost let out a scream.

However, they saw Zhao Xu, who had caused this scene, remained unmoved, with a hint of disappointment.

"It's not your tribe that is a flesh-eating demon?"

Suddenly, Zhao Xu uttered a questioning voice full of astonishment.
Here is the translation of the text:

While the sorcerer standing on the back of a dragon didn't expect Zhao Xu to discover this, his gaze was slightly annoyed, and a long-forgotten memory began to resurface.

The giant army of demons below also showed a slight tremor, as if they were echoing Zhao Xu's words.

"Is it because of the loss of the holy artifact?" Zhao Xu quickly established this connection.

The dark storm clouds above were about to unleash their fury, and Zhao Xu didn't believe these monsters would ignore it.

However, they still had to entangle them to kill them, indicating that this was a task that had to be executed.

The "holy artifact" was not just a spiritual belief.

It seemed that it was not an ordinary object, Zhao Xu thought to himself, and two templates flashed through his mind:

The demon template: Strength +10, Agility -2, Constitution +4, Intelligence -4, Charisma -4, treated as a 4th-level giant, +5 level innate defense...

The sorcerer template: Strength +10, Constitution +6, Intelligence +4, Perception +4, Charisma +6, treated as a 5th-level giant, two racial bonuses, +5 level innate defense, spellcasting ability, regeneration 5, spell resistance 19...

For a ordinary person, getting the demon template would be a challenge of level 3, and getting the sorcerer template would be at least level 8.

Although demons are generally chaotic evil, they are not without utility.

Just as Zhao Xu was thinking this, the demon who was about to harm Allow did not receive the stop command and directly swung his giant axe to chop down, as if he wanted to split this void open.

This would be a scene of bloodshed, and it shocked the recently arrived forest guide, Lan'er, who closed her eyes. She couldn't bear to see her companions, who had just been laughing and joking together, suffer such pain.

However, everyone was surrounded by danger, and they were all powerless.
Here's the translation:

Even if the next scene is one where she is insulted, everyone except her husband will fight to the death to resist, while others can only wait in pain. The difference in strength is too great!

If they were only facing a team of devourers, they would not be able to beat them, but at least they would fight with all their might and go out in a blaze of glory.

But now, they are facing an army of hundreds of devourers, and even if they stand still and let themselves be slaughtered, they may not be able to kill them all with their weapons and physical strength.

Zhao Xu is also looking at the heavy axe falling down with a calm expression.

If the opponent can break through the defensive spell he just set up for Zheng Xin An, he would sell his badge of mage tomorrow.

So Zhao Xu is the most carefree person in the crowd.

He shrugged and decided to start the game.

Originally, he wanted to teach Zheng Xin An a "weakling's" way of survival.

But now, it's no longer necessary, so he might as well switch to another lessonâ€”

who has a harder fist, who can bully others.

In the next instant, Zhao Xu's gaze turned stern, looking at the army of devourers with a condensed killing intent.

However, after Zheng Xin An revived, she seemed to have lost her previous experience and vigilance, watching the attack scene and even didn't have the instinct to dodge.

"Hey!"

You're not really stupid, are you, silly girl?

Zhao Xu was also taken aback.

Standing still, the defense could only rely on "armor" defense, which was insufficient to determine how hard it was.

It was really unlucky that they were hit by a weak spot in the armor, and it was still possible to break through the defense!

"Quick Burst!"
Here is the translation of the text:

At the moment when the giant axe's cold light was about to touch Zhao Xun's daughter's leg, Zhao Xun's "instinct magic" shattered open.

It was as if the clock had been forcibly stopped, and the entire space had completely solidified in this instant.

In the dimension where no one could see clearly!

Zhao Xun's shadow flashed.

He was like a fish swimming deep in the ocean, effortlessly traversing multiple devouring demons and directly embracing his daughter, while also rushing forward!

The entire process was like a flash of lightning, with the actions unfolding like a watercolor painting.

"Hah!"

The axe light flashed.

The devouring demons that were executing the sentence had originally aimed to sever the bones with a force that would leave no residue. However, as the board's prey suddenly disappeared, the giant axe lost its grip and fell to the ground, sinking deep into the mud.

In this instant when time suddenly recovered, Zheng Xin Ya regained consciousness and realized that she was being held in Zhao Xun's arms.

"Hey, don't you believe I'm not telling you to dodge?" Zhao Xun shook his head.

"You've lost a leg, and I have the means to regenerate it. You'll still feel pain."

However, this scene had not been noticed by many.

Because at a distant location, a sudden and sharp arrow storm attacked, and several devouring demons who failed to dodge let out a miserable cry.

The arrows with barbed tips would not only cause fresh blood to flow out of the wound and accelerate death but would also require incredible strength to pull out.

Several devouring demons let out a loud cry and directly snapped the arrow shaft, without hesitation, allowing the arrowhead to remain in their body forever.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's incredible, he's not afraid of getting hurt, and his physical condition is surprisingly good, even for an external being from another world." Zheng Xin's thoughts were a bit scattered, and he had already moved to another dimension.

"You just stay here and watch the show, don't run around near me."

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and looked at the sudden battle sounds. He already understood what was happening.

The army of flesh-eating demons had appeared, with a large cavalry unit driving towards them.

The horses under the cavalry were actually the standard-issue warhorses from King Arthur's era. Behind the cavalry, there were many adventurers with excellent equipment, preparing to start harvesting the battlefield after the cavalry's charge.

"It's the camp, the camp is sending people to save us!" The team suddenly burst into cheers.

"Let's go, we'll fight to the death and join forces with the main army to wipe out these demons!"

"Yes, charge! Take revenge!"

Just as the chaos subsided, no one had noticed what had happened to Xin, but this didn't affect their determination to fight the enemy.

This is human nature - even in desperation, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, people will fight to the death.

The players who were captured earlier also showed a glimmer of hope in their eyes, but they were bound by ropes and couldn't struggle. Except for a few adventurers who had broken free using their escape skills and were hiding, waiting for the right moment. The others could only let out cries for help, urging someone to come and untie them quickly.

"Is there a royal relative or noble who has been left behind here?"

Zhao Xu was puzzled by the entire situation. From the moment these people were surrounded to the information being transmitted and the camp's reaction, the time taken was absolutely no more than a few hours.
Here is the translation of the text:

These warhorses of the Aslan, of course, are those he has ordered to remain in this camp, and the entire camp's defensive force can be said to be the second-best in the empire, excluding the capital city.

After all, he might disappear for an extended period of time at any moment.

If he were to return and find that the camp where he left his son has been flattened by monsters, it would be a comical situation.

However, at this time point just before the heavy rain is about to fall, it would be reckless to dispatch a large force from the camp into the unexplored and deadly wilderness area.

It would take a lot of courage to do so.

Dispatching a force would leave the camp's defensive forces weakened, which might actually have the opposite effect.

"Are we the closest relatives of the emperor?" he asked awkwardly.

Zhao Xu didn't hesitate to slap his forehead; he was clearly taken aback.

Yes, it's true.

However, the reason it's impossible is that this team is here to rescue himself and his son.

His reputation, though, is not enough to give others the confidence to rescue him.

He cannot solve the problem with just a few hundred cavalrymen and adventurers.

Even with a few more Heaven Gods, it's still not enough.

Oh, yes!

He left behind a note, saying he took his son away, and from that moment on, the protection spell that was originally over the camp was transferred to him, the person involved.

So, the camp no longer needs to keep a large force on standby!

Therefore, the camp is bold enough to dispatch troops to wipe out these flesh-eating monsters.

As Zhao Xu gazed out at the continuous carnage before him, he couldn't help but wonder, who is digging the Aslan's hole?
