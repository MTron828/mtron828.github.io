Chapter 185: Breaking Down the Door

This time, Lei An arranged for a large number of people to search the area on the other side of the wilderness, mainly to find a location similar to the entrance of the devil's altar.

Originally, this task could have been replaced by magic, but the "Deep Prison Fiend" could confidently enter, and the altar itself had a special shielding effect.

Otherwise, Zhao Xu himself could have used his first-level divine magic "Earth Sense" to search for the location.

When Zhao Xu returned to the dark era, he tried using this magic to search for the "Molin Monument" at the beginning.

However, he also encountered the same shielding situation and ultimately relied on a paper note left behind by a family in a village to find the way.

This is also the reason why Lei An needs to arrange for these low-level mages to participate.

Ultimately, they surpass ordinary city guards in terms of knowledge and can notice the differences in mysterious phenomena.

Although Zhao Xu was certain that there would be no living people inside the tower, he still slowed down and moved quietly.

This way, he avoids being ambushed and instead ambushes others.

The seemingly slight difference in wording determines who can cast magic first.

The bottom layer of the tower is a thick wooden door with iron bars added for reinforcement, which can barely defend against a siege for a short time.

The door is currently half-open, revealing a gap just large enough for a person to squeeze through. The door has many holes and cavities, which have been eaten away by insects and ants, forming internal cavities.

However, Zhao Xu's footsteps come to a halt, and he does not continue forward.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he looked back, the two women behind him followed his gaze, and they saw the faint marks of teeth on the wooden door, as well as wood shavings scattered on the ground, different from the natural decay caused by insects and worms.

"Rodent-damaged," Esveith whispered in analysis.

Arthur's world had various mysterious powers, which also affected the biological characteristics of its inhabitants.

Above the animals, there were fierce creatures with stronger combat capabilities, some of which were even comparable to low-level warriors.

Above the fierce creatures, there were the inhabitants who had undergone beastification, and the most famous of these were the werewolves. However, there were also humans who had undergone beastification, such as the wild boar people and mouse people, who could maintain their human or animal forms.

However, because their beastification was contagious, once they were attacked and did not survive, they would transform into the same beastified humans.

As a result, this group was always feared and ostracized by the residents of Arthur, and they could only survive in the wilderness.

Zhao Xiu was cautious at the door and made a "listening" movement, but not only did he not hear anything, but the dynamic bar's skill check also gave him no hint.

At this time, the two women behind him also shook their heads, indicating the same result.

Zhao Xiu thought for a moment and then gently pushed open the door. At this moment, the woman behind him, Wang Qingwei, was holding a bow and arrow, ready to shoot at the widening gap. Esveith was also preparing to cast a spell according to plan.

The sound of "Ah!" suddenly stopped.

Zhao Xiu tried to pull with all his might, but it was unresponsive.

"That's because the door has been stuck for too long," Wang Qingwei said.

"When did you start adding points to your strength?" Zhao Xiu asked at the beginning, and his strength had not been added to, remaining at the initial 8 points.

So his in-game character's strength was naturally weaker than the average 10 points of strength of ordinary humans, which would also affect the intensity of his close-range attacks and close-range damage.
At this moment, Wang Congwei and Aisweiss looked at each other, both saying simultaneously, "We're just 8-pointers too."

As expected, they both abandoned close-range attacks and focused on maximizing their intelligence stats.

Zhao Xu was allocating his points to perception and charm, while Wang Congwei estimated that Aisweiss was prioritizing charm attributes, but didn't know which one Aisweiss was prioritizing.

Zhao Xu was thinking about attributes, but couldn't help but return to the starting point of this problem.

He had to solve this wooden door first.

Just after Zhao Xu's efforts, he had only managed to move a slight crack, and the door axis had become even more stuck.

Meanwhile, Aisweiss turned around, looking around to see if there were any tools they could borrow.

At this moment, their backpacks were full of ropes and hooks, but they couldn't bring explosive tools.

If there was a high-strength barbarian in the team, they could try to force open this half-broken door.

Even later, after leveling up, they could directly break through some unstable walls in underground cities, avoiding traps along the way.

Arthur was a real world, and there wouldn't be a single solution to this problem.

Wang Congwei's expression turned thoughtful.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but wonder, "Why didn't you suggest I use the second-level spell 'Tactical Strike'?"

Logically, as a spellcaster, Aisweiss should have reminded him to use a spell to solve the current predicament as soon as possible.

However, Aisweiss looked puzzled, saying, "You've learned this spell so quickly? And you only have two available second-level spell slots, wasting them here isn't a good idea."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, summer, I don't have the secondary magic pearl restored yet," Wang Congwei added, but she was still keeping a close eye on the crack, prepared for anything that might emerge.

Zhao Xu finally snapped out of it.

Unbeknownst to him, his acquired specialized abilities began to manifest.

Although he hadn't reached the level of a player in terms of mastery of three-ring magic, his current spellcaster level, boosted by various buffs, had reached level 6, with spell durations lasting six times longer than those of a level 1 mage.

In terms of spell slots, the number of spell slots granted by the mage level was fixed. A level 3 mage had one level 2 spell slot, and the number increased to four by level 9. By level 20, mages had four spell slots for each ring (one to nine).

The remaining extra spell slots could only be obtained through intelligence.

With Zhao Xu's current intelligence of 17, he could obtain an additional level 2 spell slot.

Considering he only had two level 2 spell slots, Esveigh didn't plan to let Zhao Xu waste one here.

However, Zhao Xu had the multi-talented mage ability, allowing him to combine three level 1 spell slots into a level 2 spell slot.

This also meant that Wang Congwei's eight level 1 magic pearls could unleash four level 2 spells.

At this moment, Esveigh's slightly expectant look was met with Zhao Xu's faint smile. "Not just two?" Esveigh asked.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly and said, "Let me cast a spell then."

In the QQ group discussion the night before, the team had decided on Zhao Xu as the team leader, with no other reason than that he was the strongest.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Esvezi stood behind Zhao Xun, looking at him with a deep-thinking expression.

Unquantifiable known magic.

The ability to ignore preparation and directly cast spells.

Magic power exceeding the normal level.

When these three come together, it's a mage who can't be defeated.

Esvezi could only mouth-off a few words of evaluation.

It had been half a month since Arthur entered the game, and the player had become clear-headed. Although Arthur didn't spend any in-game currency, open treasure chests, or buy items from the shop, it didn't mean it was a completely fair game.

As long as an NPC has good feelings towards you, they might directly give you a weapon. But if you make them angry, even after completing a task, there's a chance they might turn around and frame you.

At this moment, Zhao Xun was fully focused on casting the "Knock" spell, a second-level magic.

The Knock spell can open doors that are stuck, locked, or sealed, and it's also effective on secret doors. Therefore, when adventurers who are responsible for opening locks or breaking doors are ineffective during dungeon crawling, it can come in handy.

As long as Zhao Xun finishes the incantation, a beam of light will emanate from his hand, directly covering the entire wooden door.

Instantly, the rusty parts of the door's axle, which had become rusty over time, slowly began to peel off, as if a specialized woodworker had performed maintenance.

Zhao Xun saw this scene and directly reached out, lightly pulling the door. The door, which had been unable to move, was suddenly flung open to its limits.

Zhao Xun and the three of them cautiously approached the first floor of the watchtower.

Inside, the original office desks and benches were completely destroyed, with many showing signs of being eaten.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the light shone through the observation hole in the wall, it illuminated the pile of gravel in the corner. Even more surprisingly, it was possible to see the dust particles suspended in the air, and the vines had already begun to creep through the cracks in the wooden door, clinging to the large wall above.

Zhou Xu walked over, bent down, and pulled out a shovel to try to dig through the pile of gravel.

There were no signs of broken rocks or debris on the surface, but the pile of gravel was definitely unusual.

The two women also began to search the wall, trying to find clues about the abandoned watchtower.

The plain outside the watchtower was originally where the military camp was stationed, but the natural forces had already covered up the signs of occupation.

The only thing that remained was this human-built watchtower, which had managed to preserve some information due to its ability to withstand wind and rain.

Suddenly, Zhou Xu's shovel hit something, and he found that he couldn't dig further because of the obstruction. He used his gloved hands to gently pry open the pile of gravel.

Zhou Xu found an old notebook with some worn pages, and he carefully lifted it up, shaking off the gravel.

"Ah!"

A sudden, sharp cry echoed out.

Zhou Xu turned around to look, only to see a nearly one-meter-long vicious rodent on the spiral staircase leading to the second floor. Its face was twisted in a fierce snarl, and its mouth was revealing two sharp fangs.

It looked like a wild boar, but Zhou Xu was shocked and looked at the two women who had cried out in alarm.

Are you afraid of mice?

Just as Zhou Xu was about to approach the vicious rodent, four magic missiles suddenly flew down from above and struck the rodent.
Here is the translation:

That originally fierce and violent rodent directly twisted its body on the spot after being hit, and then fell heavily on the stairs, producing a muffled sound.

Zhao Xū looked on in amazement, thinking that it had been a day since Esiwei and Wáng Gēng Wēi had reached level 3 as casters, and their magic missiles had been upgraded to fire two at a time.

By day, it was unheard of for them to react so strongly to goblins.

Even though the two girls were incredibly powerful in the future, they were still afraid of the giant mouse.

Zhao Xū decided to go and observe the rodent that had received excessive lethal damage.
