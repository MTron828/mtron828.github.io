Chapter 666: Property Explosion Route, Extraction Ritual

As soon as Zhao Xu heard the voice that was both astonishing and familiar, he turned around to take a look and saw the familiar elegant figure standing before him. He then turned back to face the other An Ti Nuo Ya standing in front of him.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but feel a sense of regret, "Is this 'infinite loop' scheme going to be used like this? It's something that even a three-year-old child can see through. I deliberately said it because I couldn't come up with a better plan."

The person opposite him, a demon god, couldn't possibly use this kind of "infinite loop" scheme. Initially, the Heavenly Paradise had dragged him into the dream world and told him that he didn't need to simulate the entire world truthfully. He only needed to calculate the range within his line of sight, and it would be enough to deceive him.

So Zhao Xu also realized that he was powerless to break this illusion and could only sink deeper into it. That's why he came up with this plan.

At this moment, the fake An Ti Nuo Ya standing opposite him glanced at the two of them and then turned away, saying, "Since the host has arrived, I'll trouble you to leave my country immediately."
Immediately after, her figure disappeared without a trace, as if a white horse had galloped away and was impossible to track.

Could this be a psychological attack?

Zhao Xu felt extremely uncomfortable when he saw this scene. There was no exchange at all, and it ended abruptly. The whole process was so smooth and unbelievable.

It was as if he had been framed into a new "trap" again.

"Teacher?"

Zhao Xu could only turn around to face the other An Ti Nuo Ya who had just arrived behind him.
Here is the translation of the text:

In addition to noticing the unchanged surroundings, he found himself immersed in the dark, hollow space. "What's going on? Do I need to prove to you that I'm me? Do you want me to come and pat myself on the back?" Anzhenya looked at Zhao Xuan's eyes, which kept scanning her entire body with a hint of annoyance and asked in a sarcastic tone.

Zhao Xuan hastily waved his hand, saying, "No way, I'm only 20 years old, still very young."

"I'm strange," Anzhenya said with a smile. "That existence hasn't left yet, and the surrounding space hasn't recovered. Why?"

Zhao Xuan shrugged and replied, "Oh."

Just as Anzhenya finished speaking, she suddenly transformed into a heroic figure, her words sharp and her aura imposing. "Oh."

Zhao Xuan responded with a neutral tone, as if he had just separated from Anzhenya during the transmission process.

However, the last time, it was the demon king Yegu who used the "Fate Power" left behind by Yegu's death to expel Anzhenya and himself to different time nodes.

Anzhenya quickly followed the flow of time and found him, and then had a verbal sparring match with his historical self.

This scene has left a deep impression on Zhao Xuan.

Even the demon king Gratz had emphasized that Anzhenya was searching for her "Breach" ability to find back Ernest, and that's why she was so obedient.

This realization also made Zhao Xuan aware of the demons' ability to "stir up" in manipulating others. Once a person's heart has a gap, they may be easily crushed.

Just as Zhao Xuan was making a private comment, he suddenly woke up.

"I didn't perform the transmission?" Zhao Xuan asked himself in surprise.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What do you think?" Anzhenya smiled coldly, looking at the surroundings with a haughty expression.

"Just now, when I entered, I heard a song that I still remember. Do you remember it?"

Zhao Xu nodded silently and repeated the words: "In the eternal mansion of R'lyeh, the Great Old One calls you into a dream."

"So, I actually fell asleep?"

"No mistake," Anzhenya's mouth curled up slightly. "After being deceived once, I would never make the same mistake of being separated from you. Therefore, I was extremely cautious throughout the entire transmission process, always ready to interrupt everything at any moment."

"However, I still underestimated the strange power of that magical item. So, from the beginning, you were always standing at the top of the Yanshan Tower, and you just fell asleep."

As Anzhenya teased him, Zhao Xu's mouth opened slightly, with a mixture of surprise and disappointment.

At that moment, everything unreasonable was perfectly explained.

It turned out that the other party did not create a "divination" spell, and these were all part of a dream world. Therefore, everything was perfectly connected.

He had actually entered the dream of a malevolent deity!

And even more terrifying was that he had already experienced the "Dream Kingdom" device, but he was still caught off guard.

"This is the power of a malevolent deity like Cthulhu?" Zhao Xu sighed.

Although we were not in the same dimension, the other party could use a "Dark Tome" to make him fall asleep, which was too terrifying.

"No," Anzhenya chuckled. "The dream you entered is actually created by the external god 'Nyarlatotep' of this world. The one you described is still sealed away in that terrifying world."
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's with the outer gods?"

How is this a completely new concept?

As soon as he heard it, he felt a shiver run down his spine from the inside out.

The next second, a mysterious poem appeared in his mind:

"Transcending the realms of light and darkness, reaching the uncontainable vastness; in this hidden tomb in the universe, where time and imagination are surpassed, the sound of a mad drumbeat and the melancholic, monotonous, and blasphemous melody echoed from the dark room where the ultimate gods, those blind, mute, and foolish gods, were slowly, clumsily, and absurdly dancing. Their souls are the essence of Nyarlathotep."

Just as Zhao Xu was losing his composure, Anzheniya's sweet voice timely pulled him back from his bewilderment.

"I'm basically certain now that the painting you received from outside is likely created by Nyarlathotep after his journey to the Arthurian world, based on the ancient 'Dark Tome'."

"This is also the reason why the six-armed snake demon and the painter crossed paths without noticing each other."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but look puzzled, "Teacher, so Nyarlathotep has a connection to chaos?"

Anzheniya smiled calmly, "You can understand him as a symbol of chaos and disorder, unlike the outer gods who are indifferent to most intelligent beings. This existence is more enthusiastic about deceiving and enticing humans. He has also visited your Earth before."

"Outer gods?" Zhao Xu muttered to himself.

It's no wonder he's not above deceiving.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the dream world, all scenarios are fabricated and rely on the image of the otherworldly being, Cthulhu. As a result, some people who have narrowly escaped will mistakenly seek revenge.

"Cthulhu is also an outer god?" Zhao Xu asked in response.

He had already realized that outer gods were not the same as the evil gods in the world of Arthur.

"From a nominal standpoint, Cthulhu belongs to the 'Old Ones' camp in this terrifying world. When the stars return to their original positions, they will awaken and destroy humanity."

"As for Nyarlathotep, it is a primordial deity that represents the creation of the universe. Alongside two other deities, 'Shub-Niggurath', the Goat of the Thousand Young, and 'Yog-Sothoth', the All-Seeing, All-Knowing One, they are known as the 'Elder Gods'."

"The three of them respectively represent 'Chaos', 'Darkness', and 'The Fog of the Nameless', all born from the nucleus of the original chaos, the source of all things, 'Azathoth'."

At this point, Anzima's voice grew increasingly faint, as if drifting away like autumn leaves in the wind. It was as if she had traversed the boundary from harvest season to winter.

In an instant, Zhao Xu's mind was numb again, as if being scalded by boiling water. His gaze pierced through Anzima's body, reaching the horizon.

Zhao Xu seemed to see the deepest, most turbulent forces of destruction swirling in the depths of time, echoing with the drumbeats of countless otherworldly drums and the mournful cries of eerie flutes.

On the throne of the boundless void, countless outer gods danced, including one named Nyarlathotep.

"Legend has it that in this terrifying universe, the birth of the universe is a dream of Azathoth. This being has no soul, no intelligence, no desires, and no ambitions, simply existing in a state of unmatched strength. Once it awakens, it represents the end of the universe."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu looked at the depiction of An Ti Nuo Ya and saw the hierarchical structure of the gods in this terrifying world, as well as the terrifying Nyalatorip who had disguised himself as An Ti Nuo Ya. "That's enough, Madam. These words, you can take back to your world and discuss!" Suddenly, a cold echo reverberated through the void.

An Ti Nuo Ya remained calm and unruffled, saying, "Just a dream teaching. With your dream, I won't get bogged down too much. Otherwise, even mentioning the name of the gods might lead to unpredictable outcomes."

As she spoke, she carefully examined Zhao Xu's appearance. "You don't need to think too much about this before your legendary era."

An Ti Nuo Ya sighed, saying, "According to my guess, my teacher, who descended to the mortal realm before Arthur, possessed a nearly divine identity and power in this terrifying world. As for where he came from before that, that's unknown."

"Wait until you leave the dream, and we'll probably reach the Abyss. Originally, I wanted to explain it to you in person, but since we've taken a detour, I'll tell you the plan ahead of time."

Zhao Xu's eyes flickered slightly, indicating that they were currently in the dream world of Nyalatorip. This was also something An Ti Nuo Ya had intentionally told him.

As for why, Zhao Xu didn't know, but he didn't care, as he had enough patience to wait for An Ti Nuo Ya's hidden move.

"First, you haven't forgotten the original target of bringing you to the Abyss, have you?"

"This is natural."

Zhao Xu replied briefly, "Continuously enhance the data of the static panel."

"What method will you rely on?"

"Extraction Rite."

This time, Zhao Xu spoke slowly and carefully, emphasizing each word.

He knew this method, but hadn't expected it to come so soon.

Extraction Rite, a five-ring death spirit system, chaotic elemental magic.
Here is the translation:

The spellcasting time is one hour, and the main purpose is to set up two magical arrays. One array has a demon standing in it, and the other has a voluntary target. After a one-hour ritual, the spellcaster can extract a black, demonic essence mist from the demon and infuse it into the voluntary receiver's body.

This extracted demonic essence can enhance the voluntary being's attributes or skills. However, the demon itself will lose these added values, so the demon must be a willing ally or under duress. For example, it can be controlled using a interdimensional oath spell.

This enhancement will last forever, unless intervened by a higher-level existence than the spellcaster. However, for a spellcaster of level 70-80 like Anzuyo, this is impossible.

As for the value of the extracted enhancements, the maximum value is one-quarter of the spellcaster's level (rounded down). For example, a 39-level spellcaster like Zhao Xu can extract 9 points of attributes!

This is far beyond the +6 enhancement limit of magical items! Even Anzuyo's legendary intelligence headband, worth a million gold coins, only adds +12 intelligence. However, for Anzuyo's spellcaster level, the extracted attributes can exceed 20 points!

The only cost is that the demon's attribute adjustment value must be twice the added value. Zhao Xu wants to extract 9 points of attributes, so he needs to find a demon with an adjustment value of 18, which would be 10 + 2*18 = 46 points in normal attribute values. For example, a demon with 30 points of charm is already a charm attribute master, but can only extract 5 points of charm.
Here is the translation of the text:

The target chosen is extremely demanding. However, this spell is blocked by most practitioners because it requires a complex array of materials, including diamond dust, cold iron, precious monster blood, and various rare colors, to be processed. Additionally, each array must be activated with flawless blue sapphire energy.

In essence, the cost is roughly 1000 gold coins multiplied by the attribute value squared. Even if Zhao Xu increases his attributes by 9 points, he will have to spend 81,000 gold coins and exhaust his life energy. Fortunately, Zhao Xu possesses the "Super Natural Spell" ability, which allows him to exempt himself from these conditions.

In theory, the cost of the "Liturgy of Extraction" is more than double the price of the legendary item that enhances attributes. However, it is not well-known in the Five-Element Spell circle, as most adventurers only have one or two magical items. It only becomes prominent when the attribute value reaches +7, and there is no special feature that allows the legendary item to increase its value by tenfold.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but wrinkle his brow. "It's easy to find a demon with a single attribute of 30 points, but demons with 50 or 60 points of attributes are hard to come by."
"You can enhance attributes, and so can we. The higher the attributes, the higher the transfer. As for the temporary attributes given to demons that disappear when the spell time is up, what does it matter to you?"
"If it weren't for this Outer God, I wouldn't be able to beat you. Otherwise, the attributes transferred by the Outer God would definitely surpass my spellcasting level. We wouldn't have to catch six demons with good attribute values."
At this moment, Zhao Xu was perplexed. It's really high.
