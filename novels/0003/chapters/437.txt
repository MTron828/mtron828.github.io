Chapter 438: The Opened Memory

Despite the crowd of people gathered at the entrance, Zhao Xu's sudden display of "Counterattack Magic" immediately sent shivers down the spines of the onlookers.

Trained individuals could clearly see the "Shadow of the Wooden Rod" condensed on the mysterious wizard's body, which not only caused real harm but also possessed highly advanced combat techniques. It far exceeded the level of most people present.

It was as if an endless number of warrior shadows were attached to the mysterious wizard's body. Once someone attacked him, the powerful warrior would burst out to block the blow.

This was also the reason why people saw Zhao Xu walk into the old house without hesitation, but dared not to intervene again.

This time, Zhao Xu directly returned to the old house through the location in his memory, unlike the previous visit.

And this time, he had influenced Zheng Xin'an, causing the other party to enter the game early and almost complete the priest's training.

However, Zhao Xu's gaze quickly focused.

Compared to the Star Lake Battle on that day, the broken wooden door this time was not locked, with a small gap left open.

Last time, he had used magic to fly over the wall without using the "Knocking Technique" to open the door. This time, Zhao Xu again relied on "Flight Magic" to jump over the stone wall.

"Ah, it seems you're being very cautious now."

Anzinnia was standing in the courtyard, gazing at the deep well water with a gentle smile, her face reflected in the rippling water.

"So, is this door really opened by you, teacher?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu also didn't expect An Ti Nuo Ya to leave the door open for him, thinking it was probably some wild kids sneaking in to play in the haunted house.

According to his beliefs, a woman like An Ti Nuo Ya, who is as cold as ice, should normally use some kind of magic to create a shortcut.

Why would she go to the trouble of opening the door, dealing with all the cobwebs and dust, and then pushing the door open?

Strictly speaking, she would actually do this, and it would be a good idea to let the magic take over.

"From now on, this will be the entrance to the association, and according to tradition, we've been keeping the door open since the first day we arrived," An Ti Nuo Ya explained, with a hint of amusement.

"Oh, you mean the 'retaliatory counterattack' spell?" Zhao Xu suddenly reacted, "You really did hit me back, and then you sought revenge."

"Oh, okay," Zhao Xu said with a smile, "Since I can absorb the damage and take advantage of the 'Treasure of the Legacy Hunter' spell's effect, which is still in effect, I can transform into a 100% damage-reducing cloak."

This way, he could trigger the "retaliatory counterattack" spell and remain unharmed.

"Oh, so that's why you did that," An Ti Nuo Ya said in a clear and cold tone, "For us mages, even if we feel safe, we shouldn't put ourselves in danger."

Zhao Xu sensed that An Ti Nuo Ya's tone was unusual, and it was rare for her to educate him like this.

It was as if she had experienced some kind of disaster before, which made her so sensitive.

"They can't even distinguish between true and false based on your letters, and they have a preconceived notion of you giving away your badge, so you just used the 'Foul Cloud' spell directly."
Here is the translation:

Zhaoxu is nodding in agreement.

In reality, the people standing at the door are mostly his subordinates, and this subtle psychological phenomenon has led him to use a more cautious defensive strategy.

"However, my mentor, I'm coming here to be a vice chairman, how can I start from scratch?"

At this time, Zhaoxu looked at the old and dilapidated building and complained to Anxinyue.

From ancient times, those who took over the mantle of leadership enjoyed the blessings.

Those who opened up new territories worked hard for the benefit of future generations.

One branch of the wizard's association started from scratch and continued to establish various difficult-to-manage branches. Zhaoxu, who had read the history of the wizard's association, was more clear about this.

"If you can't even manage a small town's structure, how can I trust you to control a department of a country?"

Anxinyue spoke calmly.

On the side, Wei'an stood silently, regarding Anxinyue as a saint and standing quietly by the door, watching the two.

At this moment, Wei'an couldn't help but glance at Zhaoxu.

"Country?"
Zhaoxu's question hadn't even been spoken when his thoughts suddenly shifted.

Anxinyue was actually planning to have him take on the role of a country-level association department head.

For example, the northern alliance's association department controlled all the towns in a region.

So, he had to ensure that he wouldn't be deceived by those below him. Starting from scratch, he would personally participate in the establishment of an association department.

Only those who came from the grassroots level would not be easily deceived by the grassroots level and understand what could be done and what couldn't.

"That mentor, where is my chairman partner?"

Zhaoxu couldn't help but ask again.
Here is the translation of the text:

At this point, he had already given up on his initial goal of coming to the forum just to chat.

"Initially, it was planned to be empty, but your progress has been so fast that we've decided to let you take over," he said.

"I'm not qualified enough to be a mentor, am I?" Zhao Xu replied, taken aback by the sudden promotion.

According to the organization's rules, he was only qualified to be a mentor for the local guild, which was a makeshift arrangement at best.

However, becoming the actual guild leader required a four-ring mage, which was a significant step up.

"No, that's not it," An Ti Nia said calmly. "You need to level up to 7 now, as per the organization's requirements."

Zhao Xu was taken aback, his mind racing with the implications.

"Ah?" he said, his voice trembling with uncertainty.

"This is 7 levels, not going to buy a cabbage or something," An Ti Nia said, her tone laced with amusement.

It was well-known that the highest level achieved by players on the forum was 5, just a hair's breadth away from leveling up. However, Zhao Xu was being asked to skip two levels directly, which would be a shock to the entire forum.

"Just you talk, I didn't give you that notebook I found in May, did I?" An Ti Nia said, her lips curled into a sly smile as she gazed at Zhao Xu's conflicted expression.

Zhao Xu quickly replied, "But, mentor, I've almost accumulated enough experience points now. Directly using the notebook to level up would be a waste, wouldn't it?"

He was essentially 99% done, and using a 0-100% cheating tool would be unfair to the effort he had put in so far.
Here is the translation of the text:

The last time Zhao Xu chose to use a notebook, ultimately because the "rule-breaking" event involving the simultaneous advancement of the two elite classes in the 6th grade.

Even with the oath of the magical source, he still needed to pay a huge "accumulation" price.

So, at that time, the "notebook" was a supplement to his insufficient personal energy.

Not enough even afterwards, he still relied on Anzhi Nia to grant him a wish to break through.

However, Anzhi Nia shook her head and said, "Zhong Xia, your meticulous and thrifty nature is not at all masculine."

"I want to prove to myself that I am not a man and not in this aspect," Zhao Xu said with gritted teeth.

However, he didn't have the courage to confirm it with Anzhi Nia.

"What do you know about the divine book 'Holy Scripture' in the Goddess Temple? It can also upgrade the magic of each reader by one level. However, each person only has one opportunity to read it in their lifetime."

Zhao Xu quietly mentioned another divine artifact with similar functions and glanced at Anzhi Nia, emphasizing the significance of the notebook.

"Ha, if you don't upgrade, you'll eventually realize that you've become the god of death, but not yourself," Anzhi Nia joked.

"What's good about that?" she added.

Zhao Xu looked at Anzhi Nia, who smiled slightly, with a hint of subtlety.

"It's not that 'you're not yourself' is good, is it?"

Zhao Xu glanced at Anzhi Nia, who had some subtle expression.

"Isn't it said that the god of death is the ultimate destination of death, and it's impossible to revive?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not wrong, but it's based on the assumption that the Grim Reaper has truly 'died'. Or are you more confident that you have the qualification to define 'death'?"

Instantly, Zhao Xu was taken aback, as if a massive lightning bolt had struck his mind.

He straightened up and scanned his entire body, as if the true power of the Grim Reaper would burst forth from within him at any moment.

The temple of the Grim Reaper outside the city of Mistral.
"The Land of the Executioner", where the Grim Reaper had once suffered.
"The Land of Eternal Slumber", where countless immortal beings resided.
The amber sarcophagus, where fragments of the Grim Reaper's divine power were stored.
The legendary army of immortal guardians.
The artificial Grim Reaper.

These terms flashed through Zhao Xu's mind, all eerily close to the Grim Reaper's divine power, yet lacking true comprehension.

Over the centuries, only one being, Edmond, had managed to obtain and master the Grim Reaper's divine power, only to become the "God of Slaughter" and ultimately meet his downfall.

"I initially allowed you to enter the Grim Reaper's realm to rescue people, but at the time, I was also torn about whether to let you obtain the Grim Reaper's divine power," said Anzhiya, slowly approaching Zhao Xu.

"Because this is a matter with both benefits and drawbacks. Without any precedent, the 'divine power' that is truly untainted is a shortcut to the heavens, and its direction is so profound. Therefore, the future competition will be fierce. As for the Grim Reaper's divine power, it's exactly the opposite. If you don't handle it carefully, it may be the Grim Reaper's downfall, and its will may awaken within you."

"Can the upgrade overcome it?" Zhao Xu asked immediately.

In reality, his mind was already completely at ease.

Ultimately, it was Anzhiya's "will" that allowed him to obtain the Grim Reaper's divine power, proving that this "matter with benefits and drawbacks" was ultimately "beneficial" to him.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not that simple, there's no such principle that the stronger you are, the more likely you are to awaken the enemy. In reality, the lingering will of the god of death is very weak, and it's only by constantly using the power of the sacred art that you can activate the lingering will through friction. It's not about getting stronger, but about accumulating the power of the sacred art."

"Therefore, the more powerful you become, the less worthy of mention the lingering will becomes. Especially every time you level up, it will cause a shock to the lingering will. At this moment, it's just about to condense a small amount of essence, but suddenly it will be crushed by this treatment."

"One day, you might become a god by borrowing the power of another sacred art, and at that point, the lingering will of the god of death will become your ultimate nourishment, allowing you to directly grasp a part of the god's authority. At that moment, there will be no residual effects."

Anzetta's words slowly cleared Zhao Xu's mind.

It's no wonder that Laxus had always treated the "god of death sacred art" as a battery, using it to recharge or borrowing its power to create a virtual disciple.

Zhao Xu let out a faint sigh.

A person's fate is determined by both personal struggle and historical progress.

Now that he's at level 7, he's already reached the top.

"This instructor, I'll start merging this notebook."

"Oh, there's no need for that."

"What?"

"If the power of the god of death sacred art is so useless, how did Edmond become the god of slaughter? You used the 'soul reaping staff' to reap life when you felt that you were accumulating life energy faster in your heart."

"So now, you can level up directly through other channels."

Anzetta leaned forward, her head slowly approaching Zhao Xu's face, as if trying to form a connection between their eyes.

Zhao Xu looked directly at her, and his heart remained calm and unruffled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In the end, the ability to cultivate such a large number of high-level mages is still a bit of a shortcut available. That's because it's a stage where you can break through the ring count by learning and mastering high-level ring magic. Simply put, if you can master the four-ring magic, you can also become a 7th-level mage."

"However, I'm not in Vastime now, let's go back?"

"This method is to enter the 'core space' of the Final Scroll, not the 'projected space' you went to before. Each person only has one chance to make a strong impact, and most people choose to break through the legendary level at that time. Don't you think it's a waste to waste it now?"

"Ah?"

Zhao Xu also seemed to understand, and if this was really the case, Anzhiya would have arranged for him to break through each level long ago.

"Don't worry, the divine energy I've accumulated for you is more than enough. You're just one step away from breaking through. So, I also have my own way to achieve this indirectly."

"You just had the residual power of the Final Scroll on your body, although very weak, it's still enough. And I've entered the core space of the Final Scroll before."

"So, wait for me to release my mental block, and then you can enter my memory. Then, you can use the 'Wisdom Channeling' ability to record the spell in the memory space of the four-ring magic I've created, and break through to the 7th level. This space is neither here nor there, and it won't affect your sensitivity to legendary challenges in the future."

As Anzhiya spoke, her tone suddenly turned serious, with a wicked tone.

"Zhongshao, I'm warning you."
Here is the translation:

"At that time, I was in a state where I opened up my memories to you, but you dared to secretly look at my other memories."
"If I do, I'll use the 'Transforming All Things' of the Eight Rings to make you regret it forever, oh."
"For example, you'll only be able to address me as a sister from now on."
