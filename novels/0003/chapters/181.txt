The magician who was about to report couldn't help but look at Zhao Xu with a look of surprise. At first, the sparkling cloak with the trail of a shooting star on Zhao Xu's body had caught his attention, and seeing the bishop's badge on the other person's body had made him even more curious. However, now it seemed that the other person, at this age, also had a research on rituals? Normally, the Mystrian magicians don't research rituals much, only some senior magicians dedicated to the study of rituals would have some knowledge in this area. Combined with Captain Rean's courteous treatment of the other person, the magic guard speculated that Zhao Xu must be an expert in rituals. At this moment, Zhao Xu was deeply engrossed in contemplating the ground's magic array. Then he took out the spell notes again, and by manipulating his own consciousness, he sketched a rough diagram of the current ritual magic array on the notes. This surprised the "magic guard" who recognized the other person's actions. Normally, such scenes involving devil and demon slaughter are strictly sealed off to prevent the leakage of devil and demon powers and causing panic. In all his years, this was the first time he had seen someone so openly copying the contents of the scene in front of the "Rose Cross" members. At this point, Rean had noticed the expressions of his subordinates and explained, "He is our future team member, so this intelligence is shared with him." At this moment, Zhao Xu was completely absorbed in his thoughts. He took out a book borrowed from the legendary library called "A Hundred Detailed Rituals," and turned to a certain page, obviously having read it before and feeling something.
