Chapter 340 The Promise of the Future
Career level can be said to be the lifelong pursuit of countless people. Even the simplest "Level 1 Priest" is a difficult barrier to cross. Here in Graste, he is directly promised the title of "Legendary Priest".
Arthur's priest, after reaching the legendary level, can perform "legendary divine arts".
The "Scroll Scholar" once reproduced a "cursed stele" that can be passed down, which is a kind of legendary divine art.
However, everything about the priest comes from God and his own efforts.
When a priest reaches "legendary" status, the price that God needs to give is also close to substantial, so there are not many legendary priests who truly survive in the world.
Even if the succubus is close to legendary, it is only a challenge to the level after adding its original "succubus" strength. The succubus itself is only at the level of a seven-ring priest.
At the same time, this is not the first time Zhao Xu has heard the temptation of the legendary "cake".
But it is definitely the calmest time in his heart.
When Antinoya mentioned the legendary to him, she at least kneaded the flour for the cake first, waiting for Zhao Xu to spend some energy to "fry" it up.
Unlike Graste, who directly came with a sensational headline.
In the end, the reputation of the abyss demons is too bad.
The devils of hell, at least, understand to abide by the "contract" on the surface, deeply constrained by the power of "order".
All demons and devils who can betray their own camp are few and far between in history.
Here is the translation of the text:

Especially when Zhaoyu thought of the book "Overview of the Lord of the Abyss" he had read before, he remembered that Glaizte often brought along non-human creatures such as humanoid lions, demons, and six-armed snake demons.

Zhaoyu himself had been brought up with a good education from a young age, but if Glaizte had given him a pastoral level, he would have become a demon, which would have made him cry tears of despair.

In particular, the demon itself had a colloquial name in Arthur, known as the "absorbing essence goddess".

As it was rumored, the high-ranking pastors under Glaizte were all female, which made people feel even more uneasy.

Not to mention that he had become a pastor of the other party, directly controlling their lives and deaths.

So Zhaoyu had never considered Glaizte's advice from start to finish.

Instead, he was curious about the other party's motivations.

After all, he was not in a situation where he was besieging the city, but was being suppressed by the other party. He was not the one who had entered Arthur to threaten Glaizte's stronghold.

As soon as the demon pastor appeared, he began to manipulate the powers of most of the "pastors", and Glaizte had been plotting to seek an opportunity to meet him.

Suddenly, Zhaoyu felt as if he had been splashed with cold water.

From the time he entered Arthur, Zhaoyu's thinking had remained consistent.

Even when he was led by the situation, he stuck to this principle.

In simple terms, if there was a direct path, why take a detour?

It was only when he and Artesia had reached an agreement, and he had gone back to Mistral and then set out to find the wizard tower, that he had spent a lot of time wandering alone.
There are no shortage of spies for Gratz in the Arthurian world, whether he projects himself personally or lets priests and other agents have enough opportunities to contact Zhao Xu. No need to be in such a hurry. It's as if claiming there's a bomb on the plane someone needs to catch in order to persuade them to stay and have a meal. Too much force. It means that the other party must contact him at this moment, and even a little later, it may be too late. Zhao Xu, who had originally planned to refuse even if it meant death, suddenly became curious and asked, "A trade is like a coin with two sides, I'm afraid I don't have the luck to receive the legendary priest's reward." Hearing Zhao Xu's hesitation, the green light in Gratz's eyes shone even brighter, and with a seductive smile he said, "Don't worry, we demons don't have the same urgency as humans. Endless life makes time blurry for us, and sometimes our trades span several generations of your human family." Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu actually wanted to mock him and say, "I don't believe you for a second." They were all in such a hurry to intercept him before leaving the church, yet he claims there's no urgency. "But, old Gratz, you still haven't told me what I need to give in return," Zhao Xu didn't want the other party to avoid this point. Although this demon lord, although only a projection of himself in Arthur's world, was greatly limited in power, it was still somewhat surprised to hear Zhao Xu address it in such a casual manner, as if they were just chatting as friends. The powerful mages, even if they have become legendary, are still polite to him. And some arrogant adventurers, if they are lucky enough to reach the Silver Palace, will indeed speak to him in a rude manner.
He is usually turned into the lowest level of timid demon by him, and then thrown into the bloody battlefield to become the fertilizer of that land. After a long time, Grazt finally regained his original smile, "Mr. Midsummer, I just need your promise at some point in the future." In an instant, the heavy mist in Zhao Xu's mind was swept away by this sentence, becoming vast and boundless. Even in this brief second, Zhao Xu felt a slight tremor in the depths of his soul, the fragment of the god of death's will. Many blurry fragments of memories, as if a glass bottle shattered and turned into shiny crystals, were swept into his heart. Zhao Xu was already very clear. Grazt needed his promise. A promise that must be made at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Mysteria, and a promise that must be made before he leaves the church today. No matter how strictly he limits the scope of this promise, the other party just needs this slight opportunity. Fifty percent is to make him do something, and fifty percent is to make him give up something. Suddenly, Zhao Xu seemed to see the silver threads of countless oaths connecting him all over his body. Zhao Xu seemed to be a puppet, slowly being entangled by these subtle silver threads, and all these threads pointed to a certain position. It was not the disguised "Leian" in front of him, but the completely unfathomable black shadow behind the other party. "Master, this is the oath of the will of the abyss." After receiving the fragment of the god's will, the silent Lax suddenly woke up and spoke. "This, Lax, you always appear so 'timely'." Knowing that life and death were at stake, Zhao Xu couldn't help but want to mock his own occasional appearance and lurking of the artifact.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, master, you need to be patient, and soon you'll see a lovely Luxana. And, master, you also need to speed up your leveling progress, which will also help me to quickly merge the fragments of the god's power."

Luxana's tone was cheerful, and she didn't care about Zhao Xu's words at all.

"Are these the things you've materialized for me to see?" Zhao Xu finally returned to the topic.

As far as Glazette was concerned, Zhao Xu was now thinking deeply, as if considering whether to accept her suggestion.

"No mistake, master. The problem now is that you dare not be reckless and say half a sentence, or in this space created by Glazette, everything will become a reality. At that time, he will make you surrender the divine power you've obtained, and you can only do so."

Zhao Xu's expression was serious.

Just as he was about to think it through, he and Glazette, the Deep King, didn't dare utter a single word, fearing that the other might misinterpret something.

"Luxana, can you help me leave here?" Since Luxana appeared, Zhao Xu had sought help from this automatic loyal god.

"Hmm..." Luxana thought deeply after hearing Zhao Xu's question.

"Master, there's a problem."

"How is that?" Zhao Xu asked.

"Master, I'm a godly artifact, you know."

"What?" Zhao Xu asked, confused.

"Master, how can you have such confidence, taking what the gods have created and challenging the gods?"

"Luxana, I suddenly have some doubts about your position in the Seven Great Prophecies."

"Oh, master, you're not looking at yourself, and you're encountering what kind of enemies?" Luxana said.

Hearing this, Zhao Xu was helpless. After all, Arthur wasn't just a simple leveling game where monsters would stand still according to their levels and regions.
Here is the translation:

As Zhao Xu walked across the wilderness, he would casually kill off evil dragons that got in his way, which was a common way for players to die.

"How about it?" Suddenly, Glazet interrupted Zhao Xu's thoughts, his tone taking on a cold, icy quality.

"Actually, you don't need to worry about delaying time; someone will come to save you." Glazet seemed to exude confidence, "Or are you just unwilling to disobey the will of your goddess?"

Zhao Xu listened, completely unresponsive.

After seeing the layers of fate's threads, he had already realized that this demon was trying to manipulate him into delaying time with a "false promise".
It could be said that from the beginning of their exchange, the opponent had been plotting.

To get used to this atmosphere, and finally agree to it carelessly.

"Lord, do you have any tokens or something from the goddess, perhaps something that would have an effect?" Larkss suddenly suggested.

Tokens?
