Chapter 552: The End of the Game

The moment Zhao Xu clicked the keyboard, he had carefully considered the countless possibilities of what might happen next. However, in this instant, he still felt a bit bewildered.

It was as if a huge secret had been hidden for years and was finally about to be revealed.

This time, despite the low traffic at midnight, Zhao Xu's post had received a special notification from over half of the users who were still online.

"What?"
"Is this a joke?"
"This is too exaggerated!"
"It's been three months since April Fool's Day, hasn't it?"
"Has he been hacked?"
"Is it a mole from TC? Was it an internal employee who ran the account for half a year just for this moment?"
"This behavior of yours could cause panic and even lead to legal consequences."
"I can't imagine that my idol, who I have always respected, would do something like this to play a prank on everyone."
"But it's strange that the 100 million forum coins just disappeared like that, all for a joke?"
"I suspected that those three accounts were connected, but I never thought that the real announcement would be something like this."
"I'm not crazy, but the game players have gone mad."

At that moment, the entire thread was filled with incredulous messages.

Even if someone was sitting in front of the screen, chatting with them, it was a "god-level player" like Xiaoyang, who had attracted countless players' attention over the past half year.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But crossing over, it feels like registering a 28-day account is too absurd. Won't it be that he's not sane and has been brainwashed by the game's NPCs?

Zhaoxu set an automatic scattering mode in his post, where anyone who replies can receive 100 forum coins, which is approximately 1 yuan. Zhaoxu has accumulated various rewards and bonuses over the past half year and has also saved up 200,000 forum coins, which is approximately 20,000 yuan. He has spent it all at once.

Even if this is just a joke, it's still quite expensive.

Not to mention that most players don't believe it, but the first batch of players to reply and receive 100 forum coins will not be few. Although they mostly just post comments like "Top," "Thank you, host," or "Host is kind," they still ensure that this post remains at the top of the forum.

This hot topic guarantees that every user who logs in on the last day of June will see this message.

"What's going on here?"

The next morning, Zhang Qi woke up, rubbing his eyes, and looked at the forum, which was in disarray. He couldn't help but shake his head.

Not to mention that his QQ groups have all exploded, and everyone is discussing the same topic.

Few people recognize the truth, while most condemn and suspect that Zhongxia has gone crazy and created this mess.

Once this happens, it will only make the circle of game players even more miserable.

Meanwhile, on the forum, countless players are posting and discussing the reasons behind the joke, including the account " Dong Cheng Yin" and "Xing Kong Diao Ying" and "Zhong Xia", which are all part of a single account."
Here is the translation of the text:

Because some players in the town square of the game's town hall have seen the announcement posted on the notice board, which states that "East City's Zhao" is actually the creator of the game, "Zhao" has gained a certain amount of popularity.

However, there are some players who have taken Zhao's words at face value and are urging others to register for the game. They have even begun to post records of their purchases of "activation codes" to prove that they have registered for the game. Some enthusiastic players have even sent out free gifts to others.

Many players have advised others to register for the game, saying that it's no big deal if they don't believe it. They even joked that if the game doesn't meet their expectations, they can ask for a refund.

As a result, Zhao has accumulated a certain amount of popularity through his frequent posting in the early stages of the game and in June. Even if he wants to sell some game-related merchandise on his own platform at a high price, he can still get a lot of responses from his fans.

Fans are generally fewer and farther between, but the first cut is always worth something. Therefore, many fans of East City and Zhongxia have responded to Zhao's call, thinking that it's no big deal.

However, the game's 299 yuan price tag is not the problem; the real challenge is convincing friends and family to register for the game and complete the tasks.

On June 30th, the forum was in an uproar, and even some players' families were in an uproar. One father even posted a scathing criticism of Zhao's behavior on the forum, saying that his daughter had been tricked into registering for the game by Zhao and was now demanding that the whole family register for the game. He raged that this was a new form of exploitation, targeting underage girls who are unable to make their own decisions.
Here is the translation of the text:

This also prompted the forum administrator to step in and shut down a batch of "strategies" for registering family members' accounts. Some self-media big V's also paid attention to the recent hot topic of "Arthur" and began to organize materials, waiting for the evening to discuss and publish the topic.

Even big V lawyers started to explore which criminal law this behavior might involve.

As Zhao Xu watched the hot search list with keywords such as "Dong Cheng Yin", "All Citizens Cross", and "Arthur", he quietly put down his coffee cup.

With the "out-of-circle" effect brought by self-media, people will be crossing into "Arthur" at 12pm tonight, and some people who have been online for a day will gradually learn about this "news".

Zhao Xu also forwarded the relevant message to his family group chat, and even called his parents to tell them about it.

As for the account with 28 points assigned on the fifth ring, Zhao Xu didn't care about it as much as he did initially.

It's only natural for him to find a way to salvage the situation.

The main reason is that he saved one person, but it's hard to save the masses.

This is the reason he's willing to take a huge risk and post a topic to encourage people to register for this game's account.

As the self-media topic continues to burn, it's possible that he'll be exposed again in a few days when the topic dies down.

It's just that by that time, everyone will have already completed their crossover, and it won't matter.

This is also the reason he wants to put a lid on it.

Time is passing one minute at a time.
Here is the translation:

In the dormitory, Zhang Qi, despite initially being skeptical, thought to himself, "What if it's true?" and called his parents to tell them about it, only to be scolded by them for a whole day.

However, some of his classmates who rarely played games were persuaded by their peers and registered for an account.

Zhao Xiu caused a stir, but the impact was not significant enough to affect the people involved.

On social media, ordinary people who saw the news about the asteroid passing by just laughed and said, "Playing games is crazy!"

As for Liu Hanqiang in the dormitory, he simply shrugged it off and walked away.

Zhao Xiu, on the other hand, remained silent, as if he were just a passerby, tapping his fingers on the desk and contemplating the future.

He waited patiently for the final verdict.

His priority was no longer about crossing this event, but about the survival of humanity.

During this time, he glanced several times at the sky, recalling a scene from his past.

Back then, when TV stations suddenly broadcast news of a meteor shower in the sky, within a minute, the city's air raid sirens sounded, and students in the entire school district flocked to the balconies to watch as meteorites streaked across the sky, leaving trails of gold.

The entire Earth was subjected to a global meteor shower attack, with countless astronomers unable to believe what was happening.

Because everything that occurred exceeded the realm of possibility, shattering the current monitoring system of the astronomical community.

These meteors, like massive fireballs, suddenly appeared near the moon's orbit and then came hurtling towards the Earth.

Zhao Xiu still remembered that within a minute or so, these enormous fireballs were descending towards the ground, close enough to be seen by the naked eye.
Here is the translation of the text:

Within the distance of less than 10 seconds, the asteroid could destroy everything in this area. Suddenly, it emitted a rainbow-colored light beam and instantly harvested the souls of all people.

When people regained their consciousness later, they found themselves in a state similar to that of King Arthur's time.

"I'm going to ask East Castle, what is the key evidence given by East Castle at 8pm tonight?" someone asked.

At this moment, Zhang Qi felt the tense atmosphere among players and even some top-ranked players couldn't help but jump out with their opinions.

There were opposing and supporting views, including those who sensed that King Arthur's "true existence" was extraordinary.

However, when "King Arthur exists" and "the Earth is about to collide" are combined, it's not that easy to make people believe.

Zhang Qi, who had already logged in to play the game, spent the day watching the latest news on the forum.

Slowly, players also tried to verify the claims made by the account "East Castle" in the game, and received different responses.

However, no matter what happened in the game, it couldn't provide decisive evidence.

"Finished!" Zhang Qi suddenly shouted.

"What's wrong?" Chen Siren, who was also browsing the forum, felt that something was off.

Zhang Qi's sudden surprise and astonishment made Chen Siren curious.

"TC family has issued an announcement, saying that none of this was planned by them, and that the game content is entirely generated by the latest AI engine. Although the effect is beyond their expectations, the game is actually a large-scale test to train AI. As for the so-called 'collision event', they have no idea what caused it and think it's just a rumor. They also reserve the right to take legal action against those who spread false information."
Here is the translation of the text:

In the end, this farce finally came to a climax at around 6:30 pm, just before the ordinary people went home. Zhao Xu, however, remained unmoved and smiled silently to himself. It was a good thing that someone had registered for the game and received 28 points of talent points. But it's not like non-players didn't exist. There were indeed people who had exceptional talents and were evaluated as having 28 points of talent or even up to 32 points. What Zhao Xu was thinking was to leave a spark and let the Earth Force conserve its strength to survive the initial period and the subsequent "Seal of Magic" war. He aimed to gather as many players as possible, 1% of whom would have a reserve of strength. Gradually, the winds on the forum began to shift. The doubts about "Dong Cheng" also increased, and the posts began to evolve from 73 to 91, with 90% of people doubting. There were also those who hesitated to comment. Without the account itself, which was also "Xiaosheng" and "Xingkong Touying" - two names that were once famous - and had sufficient prestige, the torrent of criticism would have already flooded the forum. However, at 8 o'clock, Zhao Xu quietly walked out to the balcony, took out his phone, and lightly typed out the words that had once shaken Wang Qingwei: "When the sky is filled with falling fire, the crystal barrier will be breached, and Arthur will welcome a new billion subjects." Zhao Xu then simply added: "As long as everyone says this sentence out loud, they will understand my intention." There was no need to say more; everything would be proven by the power of this prophecy.
After he pressed the "Send" button, he suddenly let out a loud shout: "Oh no, Dong Cheng Yin, it's summer vacation, and he posted a new thread!"

The entire dormitory building was suddenly filled with a loud commotion, with people shouting and responding to each other.

As it turned out, there were at least tens of millions of players in the game who were waiting for Zhao Xu's latest reply.

"How come it's garbled?" Zhang Qi exclaimed in despair.

Zhao Xu's mind suddenly jolted, and he pulled out his phone.

He saw that his post had been sent, and the title of the post, which was a prediction, was completely garbled.

The seven prophecies cannot be written down.

This sentence echoed again in Zhao Xu's mind.

However, he quickly thought of a solution.

He could use "voice".

He could spread the sound, and Zhang Qi and others would spread it to their friends and family, and this wave would sweep across the entire earth.

At that time, it would be a bet to see who could register the fastest for the six million quota.

Zhao Xu sighed, walked quietly to Zhang Qi's side, and whispered: "Zhang Qi."

"Damn it!" Zhang Qi exclaimed, still trembling with his finger pointing to the latest announcement on the screen.

"Xu Ge, TC family says that the initial artificial intelligence data collection for this game has been completed, and the current goal has been achieved. For the social turmoil caused by the 'rumors' phenomenon, TC family deeply apologizes, and has decided to refund all registered accounts that have been registered since the game was launched, and the game will be shut down indefinitely."
The text translates to: "Arthur's game has ended."
