Chapter 331, The Enchanting Priest

"You're quite skilled, I'll give you that," said Rayan sarcastically. "If you just want to revive anyone, the priest's magic doesn't need to do anything."

Rayan chuckled and said, "Let's see if the opponent's friends and family can gather the necessary funds before the revival time limit expires."

For humans on Earth, death is irreversible. However, for Arthur, death is just a temporary stop along the way. As long as the soul is not extinguished, there is always a chance for revival.

Rayan suddenly noticed that Zhao Xu had given him a sidelong glance, and only then did he notice that Elliot, who was standing beside him, had eyes that had turned red.

"What's your background?" Rayan asked Elliot casually.

"I met him at the Ministry of Education, where I'm a professor," Zhao Xu explained. "I wanted him to be my assistant at the university. I originally planned to have him accompany me to 'Peters' place for a visit, but who knew we'd run into something like this."

Rayan directly asked Elliot, "What's your surname?"

Most civilians wouldn't have a chance to attend the Ministry of Education, which specialized in cultivating public officials. By asking about surname, Rayan could easily guess the person's background.

Elliot finally noticed Rayan's question and, facing this powerful individual who was about to break through the legendary level, he took a step back, his voice trembling as he said, "Kor Ellington."

Rayan heard this and immediately furrowed his brow, speaking in a strange tone: "The Kor family from the North District of the city?"

Elliot didn't expect Rayan to react so quickly, and he hung his head, saying, "That's right."

Rayan patted Zhao Xu's shoulder and said, "Good eyesight."

As soon as he looked at Elliot, "Do you still want to avenge the past?" Elliot's mother's family had the capability to make Rayen aware of their status, and it was likely that their social standing was not low. As orphans with a mother, they would not have been looted in Mistral, and their family assets would have been preserved. Elliot's mother had sufficient capital to revive the dead. However, the revival spell itself had limitations. The "revival of the dead" in the five-ring circle was calculated by day. The level of the spellcaster determined how many days ago the deceased could be revived. According to Arthur's norms, unless special measures were taken to delay the decomposition of the corpse, it was generally not necessary to use this spell after more than 10-20 days. However, it was possible that the person from the past had used an instant death spell, which would render the five-ring "revival of the dead" ineffective. The "revival spell" in the seven-ring circle, on the other hand, calculated the revival time by the level of the spellcaster, so it was definitely feasible. The spell material was worth 10,000 gold coins, and it might be a headache for many people, but for the Cole family, it was absolutely within their means. At this moment, Zhao Xu looked at Rayen, casting a questioning glance, only to see him slightly shake his head and whisper, "It can't be revived." Zhao Xu was immediately struck dumb. He had already realized that the past case was deeply entangled, and it was unlikely that Rayen would be so clear about it otherwise.

As the area where the "Maledictus" spell had been cast to conceal it began to clear, the darkness dissipated, and the entire scope of vision expanded in an instant.

Peter, on the other hand, was lying on the ground, completely unconscious, with no signs of life.

The magician responsible for the interrogation approached, his face stern and solemn. He looked at Lian with a serious expression. Lian glanced around and said, "There's no confidentiality agreement, so I'll just say it. The outer perimeter has already been set up with measures to prevent detection."

The middle-aged magician with a scarred face spoke with a sinister tone, saying, "It's a transformation ritual passed down by a demon to that young man, and he was given the corresponding ritual key items."

Hearing these words, Lian's face fell.

A demon secretly infiltrating Mistral and doing something like this is equivalent to "making a fool of oneself."

The "Species Transformation Ritual" is one of the most dangerous rituals in the world of magic, with many people opting for safer spells instead.

If the ritual is used to transform a person into a parallel species, it's tolerable. However, if it's used to transform someone into a powerful species, especially one with inherent challenge levels, the ritual's materials will be extremely expensive, and the complexity of the ritual itself will be daunting.

The addition of templates such as "Half-Divine Beings" and "Half-Infernal Beings" retains some of the original characteristics, but is still a significant change. If these beings are truly unleashed, not to mention the effect of near-immortality, their enhanced attributes and resistances will make countless evil forces flock to them.

"Demon?" Zhao Xu thought about the underlying meaning.
The text describes a powerful demon who has the ability to transform into a pitiful-looking girl, attracting men and then using her "poison kiss" to drain their life energy. Despite being only level 7, this demon's reputation is comparable to that of a level 20 demon like the Balrogoth. The demon's strength is said to be nearing legendary levels.

The group, including the powerful Rael, seems to be intimidated by the demon's power. Elliott asks for an explanation, and Zhao explains that demons often seek to upgrade their strength by becoming more powerful types, such as the Balrogoth, or by increasing their life force. He also mentions that demons have a unique ability to take on jobs, which can be challenging for even a demon with a pastor's level of strength like this one.

Zhao also notes that demons have a special characteristic that allows them to be both big and small, implying that they can be both powerful and cunning. Originally, Elliott had no idea what was going on, but he now understands the gravity of the situation and that they are facing a formidable opponent who is not afraid to show their face in a heavily guarded place like Mistral.

At this time, Liean added, "Generally, a demon lord without qualifications is not qualified to bestow divine magic. The number of those who can bestow divine magic is not out of the palm of one's hand. Moreover, their priests are rarely selected from among the demon tribe. If they can coexist like this, it is likely that the demon is deeply favored by the demon lord."

Liean glanced at the female present, deliberately lowering his voice to say, "It's possible that the other party is the consort of a demon lord, and they don't dare to let him become another demon, so they've locked him in the demon phase. Therefore, this demon is likely to be a 'chosen one'."

Hearing Liean's words, the members of the Void Squad, as well as the team brought by Liean, all looked at him simultaneously.

In recent years, even Mistral had only a few magic gods' chosen ones appear. The original chosen ones have mostly become gods.

"That's exactly what I meant," the scar-faced mage responsible for the interrogation said, "According to what the kid said, the demon is likely to be hiding near the Holy Heart Cathedral, trying to lure novice priests of the goddess into the abyss."

"Really bold," Liean, even though he was only a part-time mage association official stationed at the goddess's church, couldn't help but get fiery, "It seems that the other party has enough abyssal power to shield against detection, and is at least carrying a few divine artifacts."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly upon hearing this.

Mistral, near the church and mage association, was said to be "omniscient" and could not be underestimated.

It was only through divine power that one could resist "mundane magic".

"Let's go, let's go to the church and investigate, and if we find it, we'll really make a kill," Liean smiled with his teeth at this time.

Eliot didn't understand at this time, originally Liean had thought that the demon might be approaching a legend, and had a bit of a sense of urgency.

But how could he have thought that the other party would suddenly appear near the church, so full of excitement?

Even more strangely, the original Void Squad was also staring at Liean with their eyes wide open.
Here is the translation of the text:

Rae'an felt a bit embarrassed and said, "Alright, let's go, guys, and take care of the perimeter. We'll get the job done."

Zhao Xu also pulled Eliot, knowing that the other party didn't understand the situation.

"Let's go," he said. "I'm sure there are at least three legendary ones inside the church. Do you think we'll have any trouble capturing that demon?"

In reality, they didn't need to put in much effort. They just needed to go there, let the others know, and then assist in the process of capturing the demon.

This way, the credit would be divided into three parts, which was the reason why the Empty Squad was eyeing it.
"So, let's go and see for ourselves," Zhao Xu said.

He was also looking forward to it, having received the fragments of the god's power from Death God, but it hadn't brought any changes to his real world. However, the power of "Grazzt" had caused his attributes to synchronize in the real world.

Therefore, he was looking forward to meeting the demon with deep abyssal power on its body.
