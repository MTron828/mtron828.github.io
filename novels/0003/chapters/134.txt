Chapter 135: The Mysterious Forest of Riddles

In general, Anniya usually teaches him in person, on the spot. This time, she deliberately arranged for him to attend a lesson at a different location, which was unexpected.

Zhao Xu followed the direction given by Anniya and went to a mysterious classroom in the Learning Hall. The Learning Hall is where all apprentice mages of the Floating City receive their main training. Due to his individualized training with Anniya, Zhao Xu had never been to this place before.

The apprentices in the first to third layers were receiving training. However, when Zhao Xu entered the eighth layer, he found that the entire corridor was empty. Compared to the lower levels, the eighth layer was completely sealed off, with no light penetrating through. The only exception was the occasional faint candlelight every 20 steps.

As Zhao Xu walked, he noticed that the walls were adorned with murals, which seemed to be some sort of mysterious ritual symbols. Zhao Xu knew that some of the murals required close observation, which could easily lead to being entrapped or controlled. He did not deliberately take a closer look.

The entire corridor was filled with the sound of footsteps, as if someone else was accompanying him. Zhao Xu stopped several times, but the footsteps stopped simultaneously.

Finally, after passing through seven or eight classrooms, he discovered that the classrooms had numbered doors. This meant that Room 101, which Anniya had assigned to him, was not far away.

In contrast to the vast lecture halls, the classrooms in the Learning Hall were surprisingly small, some of which were even small meeting rooms.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu walked along the corridor, only to find that most of the classrooms looked like they had been abandoned for a long time. The chairs were even slumped over, as if they had been discarded on the floor. Some broken mirrors were stacked in the corners. The entire 8th floor, from the floor to the ceiling, was devoid of any vibrant colors, with a dull gray tone that seemed to suck the life out of everything. The scene was one of utter desolation.

As a mage, Zhao Xu was not afraid of any supernatural occurrences. His "magic missiles" were powerful enough to take down many ordinary people. However, as he walked a few steps further, he felt like he was being watched from behind. He turned around, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. He thought to himself, "Protect against evil!"

Zhao Xu decided to cast a protective spell on himself. Suddenly, he felt a surge of courage. By this time, he had reached room 93, which was just a short distance from room 101. Suddenly, a faint cry came from behind him.

Zhao Xu turned around sharply, and the door to room 92 slowly creaked open. Zhao Xu stared at the door for half a minute, his magic at the ready, but nothing came out of the room. It seemed as if the door had simply been blown open by the wind.

The only question was, where was the wind coming from? Given the oppressive atmosphere, Zhao Xu realized that his mind had begun to play tricks on him, making him prone to superstition. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small pouch containing a lion's hair.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu released the Airen stone in his hand and grasped the lion's mane as he began to chant a spell and cast a spell. "Heart of the Lion!"

Immediately after completing the spell, he pressed the warm, pulsing magical energy from his palm into his body.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's entire being was filled with unlimited courage!

At this moment, he was fearless, and no matter what supernatural phenomena occurred, he would not be afraid.

Zhao Xu gritted his teeth and rushed towards the 101 classroom with a fierce determination.

If he encountered something strange in the wilderness, he would definitely cast a spell first and take a look.

However, here in the floating city, no one knew about any special mechanisms.

The "Heart of the Lion" spell that Zhao Xu had cast on himself was a unique technique only possessed by Saint Warriors, allowing him to be immune to fear for 12 seconds (2 rounds).

Earlier, when he encountered the giant dragon, he had been completely helpless and even trembled with fear, one of the symptoms of fear.

Now, after casting this spell, he would at least not be too passive, regardless of whether it was a genuine emotional response or just the effect of the spell.

At a distance of 10 classrooms, Zhao Xu quickly completed his sprint before the 12-second time limit.

However, he silently counted down and realized that the classroom after 100 was actually classroom 102.

The 101 classroom had suddenly disappeared into thin air.

Zhao Xu stood on the wall between the two classrooms, lost in thought.

Annie Noir must have sent him here, and she wouldn't betray him.

However, Zhao Xu couldn't understand why the eighth floor of the knowledge hall seemed to be full of mysteries.

Suddenly, all the candles on the corridor went out, and darkness enveloped him. He heard muffled cries and laughter around him.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Radiance Technique." Zhao Xu suddenly took out a firefly from his pocket and performed this technique.

Instantly, the cloak he had cast with the Radiance Technique emitted a bright glow and was about to break through the darkness in front of him.

However, just as quickly, a deeper darkness like a tidal wave enveloped him.

The Radiance Technique lost its effect in an instant, and the strange sound also disappeared.

In this pitch-black environment, Zhao Xu listened to the sound of his own heartbeat.

Dong, dong, dong.

However, the "Lion's Heart" technique, which he had possessed, was already at its last second.

The fear of the deep darkness welled up in Zhao Xu's heart again.

Zhao Xu didn't think much about it; he took out another lion's whisker from his backpack.

He needed to maintain his inner calm now more than ever.

"Okay," a cold voice suddenly came from behind Zhao Xu.

Immediately, a bonfire erupted in front of him.

Before him was a desolate and devastated forest landscape.

Five robed figures, wearing cloaks, sat around a bonfire in a clearing, leaving one seat empty, waiting for him to sit down.

"The latest arrival will receive some additional intimidation. Since you didn't cry, you can sit down," one of them said.

If Zhao Xu hadn't recognized the voice of Lei An, he would have burst out laughing.

However, he still walked over and sat down in the empty seat.

It was then that Zhao Xu noticed that Lei An had winked at him.

"You little rascal, aren't you going to dispel it? I set up this scene for you to show off," Lei An's mental link suddenly transmitted.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There are no undead creatures here, so what's the use of using my ability to repel the undead?" Zhao Xu was about to forget he even had this ability if it weren't for Lei An's reminder.

Now that he's facing a problem, he tends to rely more on his own magic.

"You're also foolish," Lei An said with a smile. "The positive energy released by my ability is meant to have a warm-hearted effect on people."

"I was planning to let you show off your skills and arrange a more terrifying plot for you. Can you make this illusion work?"

Zhao Xu only realized this when he heard these words, "Your illusions are too strong, aren't they?"

"What nonsense," Lei An said with a smile. "This is just an illusionary mirror, controlled by me. I can manipulate the space and illusions here at will."

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already sat down in the corner, noticing that the two companions beside him were all female.

Thinking about how they had just been terrorized by Lei An's evil sense of humor, Zhao Xu couldn't help but show a sympathetic expression.

"How are you doing?" the female mage on his left asked, concerned.

Zhao Xu nodded slightly, "I'm fine."

"Some of these illusions are beyond the normal range of illusions," the female mage on his right said, who had just tested them. "Some things are indeed real and tangible."

Zhao Xu leaned against the bonfire, subtly noticing that the eyes under the hood of the opponent were purple.

"Hmph, who told you these are illusions?" Lei An suddenly walked up to the bonfire and gazed at the six mages.

"Welcome to the Secret Forest," Lei An said in a low, hoarse voice.

Zhao Xu guessed that it was probably an illusionary sound imitation.

"Isn't this for me to teach you how to use the 'Camouflage Spell' ability?" Zhao Xu asked, using his mental link magic to ask Lei An.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That's the reward for crossing the barrier, you stupid idiot, first take the test. If you're going to drag your teammates down and lose, you'll get taught, but they won't be qualified. Think you're the only one who can teach everything?"

Lei An said with a malicious grin. "I'm thinking about it, and I'm actually starting to get annoyed. I had to wait until I was almost level 10 to learn this technique."

"The eighth floor of the Hall of Wisdom is actually an invisible portal. Once you step out, you'll be transported to a designated location, which is here - the Mystic Forest."

"I'm sure you've all heard it before? You can only get that ability by passing the test."

There's nothing more attractive than an ability that no other player can learn.

Even though Zhao Xu knew he could get this ability, he still couldn't help but listen to Lei An continue speaking.

"Wait, we'll be divided into two teams, and you'll each choose your own code name in the team. Then use the code name to identify yourself in the team."

"The test is very simple. I've placed something in the Mystic Forest. Find that thing, come back to the fire here, and you'll pass the test."

Lei An said every word slowly.

"What is that thing?" a mage at the front of the group asked.

"Do you ask me, I'll ask someone else?" Lei An flashed his true nature, but quickly pulled it back. "You'll know when you see it."

"Alright, this is the dividing line. You'll leave me thirty meters away in two rounds of time. Otherwise, I'll activate the instant death spell."

As soon as Lei An finished speaking, Zhao Xu and the two mages standing next to him quickly stood up and retreated to the side.

They didn't stop until they reached a withered tree.
Here is the translation:

The girl who started talking to Zhao Xu said, "Let me introduce myself. My nickname is Lu, a 2nd-level mage player."
"The nickname is Ying, also a 2nd-level mage player," the purple-eyed mage woman replied.
At this moment, the three of them looked at Zhao Xu.
After a moment of silence, Zhao Xu said, "My nickname is Feng, also a 2nd-level mage player."
The three of them exchanged awkward glances.
Who knows when Arthur would suddenly appear with three 2nd-level mages.
