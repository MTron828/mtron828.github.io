Chapter 347: Expanding Magic

After trying out several scenarios, Zhao Xu also managed to explore the boundary of his "Supernatural Control" ability. On one hand, this ability would increase the casting time of all his spells. "Swift" actions would automatically become "Iconic", "Iconic" would become "Full Circle", and originally "Full Circle" would become "Two Circle" time. As a result, even if Zhao Xu added "Instant Release" to most of his spells, the casting time would still return to normal, and he would need to rely on subsequent spell expansion to continue compressing time.

On the other hand, "Energy Shield" itself is a contact spell and is not a "Fixed Distance" or "Self" spell, so it cannot be maintained for a long time.

This means that in urgent and sudden battles, Zhao Xu would need to cast this spell with a duration of one minute per caster level before casting other spells.

Additionally, just like Zhao Xu used the "Secondary Swift Explosion" spell in the past. Before he was actually punished with dizziness, he could not cast this spell again, and he would not be able to use the "Unlimited Chain" "Higher Swift Explosion" route afterwards.

As for "Energy Shield", although it does not have the limitation of needing to withstand attribute damage to continue being effective.

However, every time Zhao Xu casts "Energy Shield", he can only choose to sacrifice one attribute, and after the immunity is successful, he cannot re-select the attribute. In other words, each "Energy Shield" spell corresponds to six attributes and can be used six times with the "Supernatural Control" ability.

After that, he had to refresh his "Energy Protection" skill again. Moreover, since his power was only 8 points, even if he had immunity, he could only adjust the 7th circle at most if he chose to harm his power attribute.

Zhao Xu speculated that this was also a manifestation of the "World Will" suppressing balance.

Even if this was the case, he was not worried at all. Even if it was true, he could immediately respond with a recovery attribute after harming his attribute.

The strength of a mage lies in his ability to face difficulties by combining various skills, advancements, specialties, and magical items to come up with new strategies.

After reviewing the powerful "Advanced Magician" profession, Zhao Xu's attention shifted to the "Curse Guardian" advancement.

Compared to mages like the "Voluminous Scholar" who only had a D4 life die (increasing by 1-4 HP per level), the "Curse Guardian" had a D6 life die, with a prerequisite of 8th-level knowledge and spell recognition, which was within the reach of 5th-level characters.

If an adventurer did not have Zhao Xu's "Cleric" knowledge domain, even if he had truly reached the 22 intelligence limit, it was basically impossible to maintain a high level of knowledge skills and upgrade speed simultaneously.

The knowledge skills of a 1st-level mage could reach 4th level, but most players could only barely reach 1-2nd level.

This meant that even if an advancement was sent, it was powerless to enjoy it.

The specialized requirements for the "Scribe of the Scroll" are a combination of a special talent for the scroll and a talent for creating items. Zhao Xu's "Copy of the Scroll" may look ordinary, but it also counts as a talent for creating items, which perfectly satisfies the requirement.

The third condition for the "Guardian of the Incantation" is that one must be able to simultaneously cast divine and arcane magic. This is exactly what has hindered countless wizards.

The fourth condition is that one must have a "magic domain". This is even more specific, requiring a priest of the magical faction.

Zhao Xu initially understood the requirements for the "Guardian of the Incantation" after seeing it on the "Stone of Morlin". This is why his second career path is not from level 1 scroll, but from level 1 priest, specifically the variant "Monk Priest".

This is because it allows him to meet the requirements for the "Guardian of the Incantation". This is the gift of the magic goddess to him in that instant.

Just like when Rayan previously cast a spell, he was immediately resisted by the "Charm" spell. But after Zhao Xu acquired the 4th-level "Supernatural Magic" ability, he could convert his spell into a "Supernatural Ability", directly ignoring the resistance and instantly killing.

Even spells like "Profane Speech" (evil), "Holy Speech" (good), "Lawspeaking" (lawful), and "True Name" (chaotic) - the four major seven-ring true name spells - are spells that will ignore the level and life dice difference of 10 levels or more and directly destroy. The only limitation is that they are subject to "spell resistance".

However, after Zhao Xu's "Supernatural Magic" ability was boosted, they became "Instant Kill Spells" that ignore spell resistance.

Additionally, Anniya can stack over 30 levels of wizard levels and create over 70 levels of "Caster Levels", so Zhao Xu can also stack his levels in the same way.

With a heart calculation, even a giant dragon from ancient times could be killed by him with a single "holy word". He's a killer in the mortal realm.

Unfortunately, his "supernatural magic" is a 4th-level job ability of the "curse script guardian", which Zhao Xu currently only possesses at the 1st level, and can only extend a specific spell.

This ability allows Zhao Xu to designate a spell as an "extended spell" and convert prepared spells of the same level or higher to the designated extended spell. It's similar to the "automatic spellcasting" ability of a priest, which can convert all divine spells to the same level of "healing divine spell".

For Zhao Xu, who has the abilities of "multi-talented spellcaster" and "precognitive foresight", this ability has little significance.

This also made Zhao Xu realize that "spell slots" and "prepared spells" are limitations for many spellcasters, including Earth players and Arthurian players, and that they are all restricted by this.

However, Zhao Xu has already broken free from these restrictions through his expertise and can now obtain this ability without any practical use.

At this time, after upgrading to level 6, Zhao Xu felt a sense of power as a character, and also estimated the time left before his afternoon lecture. He then walked out of the Holy Heart Cathedral and chose to go to some magic material shops to replenish his three-ring divine spell materials.

After upgrading to level 6, Zhao Xu can now cast three-ring divine spells, including the three-ring spells of the poet, mage, ranger, and paladin, as well as the Druid spell.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhaoxu bypassed two intersections and walked into a narrow alley, where he suddenly felt a sense of intuition and stopped in his tracks.

At this moment, his gaze followed the direction of his intuition, which led him to a group of people gathered together, surrounding something unknown.

Recognizing this as the direction of Zheng Xin'an's faith, Zhaoxu directly took a step forward to approach them.

For the past half month, Zhaoxu had also served as a lecturer for the novice pastors, including Zheng Xin'an, and had gotten to know them somewhat.

Meanwhile, Zheng Xin'an had not changed her faith towards the magic goddess, and her faith was still directed towards Zhaoxu.

However, Zhaoxu was busy with his own promotion and had not paid much attention to the spiritual faith aspect, so he did not intervene in Zheng Xin'an's life.

As he approached, he saw a group of people gathered together, though he didn't know if it was Zheng Xin'an who was in trouble, he hastened his pace to get closer.

Soon, he saw several novice pastors who had received his training, looking worried and standing there.

Zhaoxu gently pushed through the crowd, trying to squeeze in, and didn't need to use his advanced magic to clear a path.

The surrounding crowd was initially annoyed, but when they saw Zhaoxu's priestly robes, they immediately fell silent.

In Mistral, priests and mages held the dominant position in this city, and ordinary people dared not offend them.

Especially, the golden thread pattern embroidered on Zhaoxu's robes indicated that he was at least a three-ring priest.

In no time, Zhaoxu had squeezed into the center, where he saw a middle-aged woman, her face pale, her body gaunt, lying on the ground and unconscious.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zheng Xin'an and the other novice pastor standing beside her were trying to put their "medical" skills to the test, attempting to restore the consciousness of the unconscious woman. Seeing that it wasn't Zheng Xin'an who was in trouble, Zhao Xu also let out a sigh of relief. The last time, the demon directly used the "profane language" to wipe out the lives of all novice pastors in the classroom, including Zheng Xin'an. When Zhao Xu saw that scene, he was immediately reminded of his past life and almost had a heart attack. Luckily, in this life, he had gained the ability to turn the situation around. This was also the reason why Zhao Xu had been studying hard for half a month to reach the sixth level. He desperately needed power to stop regretting his own powerlessness. "Ah, lecturer," the female students standing behind Zheng Xin'an recognized Zhao Xu, who had taught their class. At this moment, Zheng Xin'an looked up and saw Zhao Xu, and her expression was filled with joy and relief, feeling a sense of calm in her heart. "What's going on?" Zhao Xu asked, squatting down beside the middle-aged woman who had fallen to the ground.
