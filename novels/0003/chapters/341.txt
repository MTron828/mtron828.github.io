Chapter 342: Sisilvina

It only requires "swift action" for Zhao Xuan to quickly cast the two-ring spell "Divine Proof" with a single finger, accompanied by his loud invocation of the divine name.

Compared to the silent illusory spell of the first ring, the second-ring divine spell "Divine Proof" directly manifests a divine illusion. If the enemy sees this illusion and fails to resist, they will succumb to terror.

Suddenly, the illusory image of the magic goddess hovered above Zhao Xuan, as if he was enveloped in a layer of divine aura.

This illusion caused Zhao Xuan's entire body to take on a ghostly appearance, evoking a sense of terror.

At the same time, the faceless magic goddess illusion began to chant mysterious incantations, and a stream of mystical energy seemed to rise from the void, as if a tidal wave of energy had been unleashed. It was as if Sisilvina herself had descended upon the scene, pouring out her limitless divine power to suppress all abnormal fluctuations from the depths.

Even Grazzit, who had already revealed his true form, was startled when he heard Zhao Xuan invoke the true name of the magic goddess, and his soul trembled with fear.

However, Zhao Xuan only cast the two-ring spell "Divine Proof" and Grazzit couldn't help but want to laugh out loud at the ease with which the spell was cast.

This illusion spell, which combined the elements of "fear" and "influence on the mind," was simply too easy to dispel.

A single eight-ring spell "Psychic Barrier" could ignore all mind-influencing spells.

Why did the mortal before him think that this spell would be effective against Grazzit?
Although this spell is immune to spell resistance and only tests willpower, the power it projects is far superior to the opponent, even if it were to test against willpower. It's utterly fearless.

This spell has no effect on it at all.

However, when the illusionary image of the goddess of magic begins to take shape, the demon king Glazet shows an unbelievable expression.

It notices that the illusionary image before it is not only more "real" than other illusions, but the aura it emits makes Glazet, who has previously interacted with Xylvinia, almost believe that the standing figure is actually Xylvinia before she became a goddess.

Enraged, Glazet lifts his massive arm, which has become even heavier than a dumbbell, and is about to strike Zhao Xu with a blow.

With his current strength and countless battle experiences, Glazet can be said to be like a gazelle, and this blow will be unstoppable.

Zhao Xu's defense, which is not over 20 levels, cannot withstand this blow.

Even more terrifying is the hidden trick that will occur after Zhao Xu tries to block this blow.

However, just as Glazet was about to strike the goddess statue with a blow, his entire body suddenly shook, and his massive arm, which was like a toy being twisted and distorted, reversed direction and quickly retracted.

Not caring about his arm, which had already begun to twist and distort, Glazet's body suddenly turned into a crystal-like foam and flew away, as if it were made of wax.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the same time, the space that was originally sealed and stretched out like a shadow, slowly began to recover, like a long piece of dough being kneaded back into a ball.

Finally, the kind of oppressive and dark destructive aura that permeated the entire space began to dissipate, as if a pile of blocks had collapsed.

Zhao Xu looked up and noticed that the "Gralzter" that had just trapped him had completely disappeared.

The original tidal wave of attacks also seemed to have disappeared without a trace, like thunder without rain, and had vanished without causing any ripples.

"Wow, that was a close call!" Lark said, almost slapping her chest in surprise.

"How did it just disappear?"

Zhao Xu had just gambled everything on this move, and in fact, he had used himself as a talisman.

The divine illusion that enveloped his body was empty, but he had seen the goddess and imbued the illusion with divine power.

The near-transparent illusion that enveloped him was real, and combined with his own 1st-level priest level, he had managed to play the role of a goddess's messenger.

This virtual reality had already met the description of the goddess, and Zhao Xu was waiting for the goddess to transmit divine power and display a miracle.

However, just as Gralzter was about to strike, it suddenly stopped.

The opponent didn't even dare to offend the illusion of the goddess Sylvia, and instead fled in fear.

However, Zhao Xu was clear that Gralzter had been trespassing and had come straight to the Sacred Heart Cathedral to face him.

It had caused the entire cathedral to be in an uproar, and would become a topic of conversation for the next few years.

This demon was saying it would fear the goddess's divine power, but it was no match for the legendary Holy Warrior.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hehe, there's actually a small story behind this. I thought it was fake at first, but after thinking about it carefully, it's probably true."

Lakshmi continued to bubble up, saying, "How do you say it?"

The former player didn't touch on too many top-level inside stories, so Zhao Xu also didn't hear much about it, and he was curious.

"It's said that a long time ago, Gralt was fighting with another powerful underworld monarch for the position of the only monarch. However, during that battle, he suddenly disappeared without a trace, causing his demonic army to flee, and eventually, his lair was occupied by others. Later, people learned that Gralt was summoned to the Arthurian material plane by a powerful wizard, and was heavily imprisoned."

"It's said that the incident had a profound impact on Gralt, and people have speculated about who the powerful wizard was that could devour a demon as strong as Gralt."

"Now, judging by the situation, that powerful wizard is probably the former Xylara."

This sentence made Zhao Xu furrow his brow, thinking that Gralt was probably a masochist.
"Isn't it a bit childish to just chase Gralt away like that?"

However, Lakshmi suddenly fell silent, as if the network connection had been cut off.

This made Zhao Xu think something had happened, and he quickly looked around cautiously.

However, the elevator was still motionless, and the only sound was his own breathing.

In fact, everything had returned to its original state, whether it was the scene or the layout.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Suddenly, Zhao Xu thought of an unimaginable possibility and stared blankly at the illusionary shell surrounding himself.

The illusionary image, like a dandelion blown by the wind, suddenly scattered apart and slowly drifted towards Zhao Xu's front, only to slowly accumulate into a human figure.

At this moment, Zhao Xu's heart began to accelerate its beating.

He also started to inspect his various statuses, including his priestly abilities and various priestly powers.

Slowly, the energy of the divine proof that had dispersed began to recombine in front of Zhao Xu, suddenly merging into a glowing ball accompanied by an ethereal and mysterious aura.

Zhao Xu suddenly looked up, and the glowing ball emitted countless arcane characters, each of which seemed familiar but impossible to grasp and remember.

In the end, the glowing ball reassembled into a majestic and elegant figure, wearing a crimson robe with golden trim, and a dignified demeanor that was like a heavy blow to Zhao Xu's heart.

Zhao Xu directly closed his eyes, afraid to look again, lest he lose himself and do something sacrilegious.

It wasn't that he lacked self-control, but rather that seeing the other person would inevitably stir up his human nature's pursuit of beauty and goodness, causing his entire being to be in turmoil.

"Long time no see."
The ethereal laughter drifted into his ears, as if he were transported to a heavenly realm or a dreamland.
