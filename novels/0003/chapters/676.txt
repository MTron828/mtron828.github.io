Chapter 677: Battlefield Harvest

The average lowest challenge level of the devouring demons is 3, and their life points are usually around 30 points. They carry a wooden club with nails or a specialized javelin for throwing.

This demon race, with their chaotic nature and combined physical strength, is naturally inclined to eat "savage people" as a living. Many devouring demons often take on the role of savage people and become tribal leaders.

As these "savage devouring demons" suddenly roar with rage and unleash their fierce abilities, many devouring demons join in, boosting morale and gathering a determination to fight to the death.

The originally confident cavalrymen feel a chill run down their spines, and their warhorses can't help but lift their front legs nervously, letting out a loud whinny.

The naturally foolish but more ferocious two-legged flying dragons continuously dive-bomb the ground, using their claws to grab their targets and then strike their tails into their bodies.

A few heavily armored cavalrymen accidentally fall into the enemy's hands, helplessly flailing their limbs and gazing at the increasingly vast ground.

The venom of the two-legged flying dragons is extremely tyrannical, dealing immediate and subsequent damage of 2-12 (2D6). Even the strongest man would collapse after two rounds.

Each time the two-legged flying dragons release their prey, performing an aerial throw, the fallen cavalrymen usually turn pale due to the venom's bodily harm and soon succumb to death.

The conflict on the battlefield, which lasted for only two or three rounds, has already resulted in significant casualties.

In the midst of the chaos, a few warriors tried to rescue their comrades' bodies by darting between the hail of arrows. As the spears and crossbows clashed on the battlefield, the fighters engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat. Some of them even became bloodthirsty, still biting their teeth and fighting fiercely, swinging their swords back and forth in a sea of blood. How could there be such hatred?

Zhao Xun wondered in his heart why these fighters were fighting so fiercely, as if they had never intended to leave any survivors. If he had encountered these demonic creatures in his daily life, there would have been a slight chance of survival. However, after fighting with the main force behind him, Zhao Xun realized that his last chance at survival was blocked, and he couldn't just stand by and watch.

The mage, known as the "Controller," relied on his extraordinary magical abilities to intimidate his opponents. After obtaining the small artifact "Heavenly Gate," he began to wreak havoc on all sides. Zhao Xun also mastered the most basic magic spell, the "Web of Illusion," which allowed him to cover a position slightly behind the front lines.

Originally, the web had a radius of about 6 meters, but with the "Magic Expansion" simulation, it expanded, scattering, and spreading in four different forms, with the effective range of the spell automatically doubling. As a "Scattering Spell," the web's radius increased to a whopping 12 meters, and the area from the original 100 square meters expanded to over 400 square meters.

Just as a 10-inch pizza is 1.5 times larger than an 8-inch pizza, the boost brought by this specialization is enormous.

Initially, mages faced small-scale battles, and their spell range was sufficient to cover everything.

However, after experiencing battles on a large scale and deep in terrain, they realized the value of this "spell extension" specialization.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xu moved swiftly, casting spells one after another, and suddenly the entire frontline was covered by a massive network of spells.

These spells seemed to have been spat out by a giant spider, forming a multi-layered structure that was both resilient and sticky. It looked like a spider's web, but was much larger and thicker.

"What is this?" someone asked.

"It's a spider's web, with mages hidden inside," someone replied.

"I know it's a spider's web, but why is it so large?" someone else asked.

Instantly, the army of ogres on the frontline was surrounded by Zhao Xu's massive spider web, and they could only struggle to swing their massive wooden clubs and axes, trying to break through a path.

On the other side of the battlefield, the cavalry commander suddenly grinned, turned his head back, and shouted, "Is someone from our ranks helping out?"

However, no one responded.

Instead, a mage in the army noticed the subtlety and suggested, "Let's launch a counterattack quickly. These ogres have strong innate strength, and the spider web won't hold them back for long."

Hearing this, the commander immediately waved his battle flag, reorganized the somewhat disordered cavalry unit, and launched another charge.

At that moment, the dragons flying overhead were not affected, but the coordinated attack had stalled.
Here is the translation of the text:

The cannibal wizards riding on the back of flying dragons, their bodies easily recognizable compared to their table cousins, the cannibal wizards, with pale green to pale blue skin and black or dark brown hair.

Upon seeing the four thick and sturdy spider webs, one cannot help but suspect that there is a team of wizards hiding around, preparing to use their abilities such as "transmutation" to escape.

Moreover, their magical abilities are powerless against these spider webs.

Even the so-called cannibal wizards have a limited range of magical abilities.

In a flash, the entire team of cannibal wizards began to take action, cutting down the trees on which the spider webs were attached.

The silk itself must be attached to a fixed point; once it loses this tension, the magical energy will instantly collapse, and the spider web will disintegrate and disappear.

The earthlings were amazed by the scene, unable to believe that these monsters had such intelligence, and quickly found a way to solve the problem.

Therefore, the art of spider webs is more effective in a sealed underground castle, where there are walls on all sides, making it impossible to cut them down.

"Quickly, launch the fire arrow!" The cavalry commander communicated with the wizards and urgently issued new orders to the archers behind.

"Adventure seekers, bring fireballs and torches, throw them into the spider web!"
"Hurry, the flammable gelatin is also effective, calculate the loss of battle."

The spider web's silk itself is flammable, so a magical fire arrow can easily break through and penetrate.

However, once ignited, the living things trapped in the spider web will suffer burns from the fire.

The cannibal wizards thought of a countermeasure to break the spider web, and the players also urgently utilized the last shred of value of the spider web, with both sides competing in a battle of wits and bravery.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhou Xu was silently watching the changes on the battlefield, his hand reaching into his backpack and slowly pulling out a series of alchemy items, handing them to the demon-like woman, Ren'er, who was chopping food like a sugar cane.

"Ren'er, take a look at these alchemy items and get ready to take them too," he said.

"This is a strong acid bottle, 10 gold coins per bottle, and can be used as a throwing weapon. It deals 1-6 points of acid damage, and is effective against those with regenerative abilities like wizards who are vulnerable to fire and acid."

"This is a flammable adhesive, 20 gold coins, which will naturally ignite when exposed to air. It can cause 1-6 points of fire damage, and if not extinguished in time, will cause additional burn damage."

Zhou Xu also briefly introduced these two common alchemy items, which were manufactured through alchemy.

As he spoke, he casually flicked his hand at the demon-like woman next to him, and a demon-like creature that had just approached him was knocked to the ground, with the acid liquid splashing all over its body, causing it to cry out in pain.

However, the fierce momentum only made it more determined to take revenge on Zhou Xu.

"But the effect is like this, a few points of damage, and it won't shake these demon-like creatures," Zhou Xu summarized. "So their fundamental use is up to your imagination, such as using them to ignite spider webs just now."

Meanwhile, Ren'er quickly moved in front of Zhou Xu to block the attack.

To outsiders, it seemed as if Ren'er was guarding this unflappable man.

"Ren'er, I just used the 'spider web' spell from the second circle of the curse system, but there are many more curse system spells that can turn the tide of battle. You should recognize them too," Zhou Xu said, looking at the cleared area in front of him.
Here is the translation:

Some ogres were covered in gray dust from the spider web, but the 2-8 (2D4) burn damage did not affect the overall situation. The battlefield was still intense, and many horsemen on Earth had already been killed.

The next instant, Zhao Xu dropped the remaining spider web material and pulled out another material from his pocket, a few stinking melon leaves.

He cast the spell, and a fog wall extended from the location he designated, covering many ogres and rolling over them. The fog itself had a strong stench.

Even though the ogres were accustomed to the stench of their group, they still couldn't bear it and were overcome with nausea.

Those who were quick to react and tried to roll out of the fog area still couldn't shake off the feeling of disgust.

Nausea is an extremely powerful negative state. Once you enter it, you cannot perform any attacks, spells, or actions that require focus.

The fog spell, after being expanded, still covered the same area as the spider web spell, and all the creatures trapped in it lost their ability to stand and frantically tried to escape towards the edges. However, they were surrounded by ogres on all sides, and it was chaotic.

The fog rose to a height of nearly three to four floors and was blown away by the wind. Some flying dragons, careless in their flight, fell to the ground.

The human cavalry took advantage of the opportunity and launched a massacre against these ogres who had lost their combat effectiveness.

The scales of war finally tipped in favor of the human side, and it was just a few "fog spells" with no direct damage that achieved this miraculous effect.
