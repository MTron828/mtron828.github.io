Chapter 669: The First Shot for a Rookie

"Can we just do it like this?" Zheng Xin'an asked.

After listening to Zhao Xu's proposal, Zheng Xin'an didn't even consider the risks involved and directly agreed. Initially, when Zhao Xu transmitted the information about the "Earth's destruction" to her through "divine power", Zheng Xin'an had grown up rapidly over the course of a month, realizing that the future of her parents was resting on her shoulders.

Now, having lost her memories, Zheng Xin'an had surprisingly regained her original 18-year-old girl's vitality. As soon as she heard that she could leave this prison-like room and go for a stroll, she was overjoyed.

At this moment, the two had already reached the edge of the camp zone, a specially designated isolation area that ordinary civilians wouldn't dare to venture into, except for adventurers. "Don't worry, everything is under my control," Zhao Xu reassured.

This time, he was essentially giving Zheng Xin'an a basic adventure education, and it was possible for him to interrupt the instruction at any moment due to the call from Anniya to descend into the abyss.

So, after thinking it over, he decided to have their first adventure here, just a hundred miles or so from the camp zone's edge.

Although the dark clouds filled the sky, adventurers were still flocking to this warning zone. Moreover, due to the high ratio of adventurers and the continuous return of adventurers who had completed their quests, this warning zone had become a commercial district for adventurers.
Here is the translation of the text:

Due to the loss of the revive stone, although adventuring is a high-yield behavior, many adventurers still exercise caution and choose to travel in groups as much as possible. In the alert zone, many adventure teams even scream for target personnel.

"Captain, how many teams are carrying big packs? Are we just going to hang around for a bit and then come back? Or are we going to team up with these adventure teams?"

Zheng Xin'an immediately noticed their differences from other teams.

Although Zhao Xu was wearing many sets of adventure gear, including sacrificial robes, priest robes, and cloaks, he only had a simple backpack on his back. Meanwhile, she was wearing the "Heavenly Armor" given to her by Zhao Xu.

The armor itself emitted a flashing golden glow and was an extremely lightweight +3 chain armor that provided 8-tier armor defense when combined with her existing armor. The key was that this "Heavenly Armor" was a light armor, weighing only over 10 pounds, even less than some elementary school students' backpacks.

Additionally, it could activate the "Flying Technique" once a day, worthy of its market value of 22,400 gold coins.

"Ah, they're preparing for the possibility of heavy rain falling from the sky, so they brought simple tents and woolen sleeping bags," Zhao Xu explained. "But I have magic, so we don't need to bring them."

Just then, a poet with golden hair and white teeth walked up to them from a small team of over ten people.

"Friend, would you like to join us on our adventure outside?"

"We plan to hunt some animals before the heavy rain falls, so we can store them as food for the coming storm," the poet said, his gaze sweeping across the armor emitting golden light, realizing that this was definitely a magical item.
Here is the translation of the text:

With a sly look, he hastily said, "Our animal food gathering will all converge together, and then 80% will be distributed equally among everyone, and 20% will be allocated to those who have outstanding performance."

"You see, you two didn't bring a tent, but we adventurers carried tents in batches, and we can even fit a few sleeping bags in them, which is perfect for you."

As he glanced at the other adventure teams in the warning zone, "Other teams may have better conditions, but their tents may not be big enough, and many teams are all-male, so you can't be too careful."

"If you join us, your girlfriend can even mingle with our female team members."

After hearing the poet's words, Zhao Xu also understood.

Compared to the "external god" threat he faced an hour ago, this adventure action was just a simple "hunting" expedition.

Suddenly, the air was filled with the simplest, most primitive sense of living.

No one knew when the big storm would arrive, but once it did, it would undoubtedly paralyze the camp's operations.

Although food reserves had been distributed in advance, everyone predicted that the storm would last for an unknown length of time.

This is also why these adventurers knew that it was urgent to venture out to hunt and prepare for winter.

The other adventure team was also formed for the same reason.

And they will be invited to join naturally, all due to the reason that Zheng Xin'an is wearing the magical helmet.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but want to pat his head.

He wanted to cultivate Zheng Xin'an's adventure abilities, so even with a storage of hundreds or thousands of magical items, he only gave Xin'an a "Sky Shield".

Zhao Xu wanted to cultivate the other party.
Here is the translation of the text:

If there's no sense of urgency in a simple duel, there's no meaning to the training. However, who would have thought that a seemingly insignificant magical armor in his eyes would still make Zheng Xin allow the others to approach him, making him the "main attraction" in this situation.

Zheng Xin also turned his head away, looking forward to Zhao Xu's response with great enthusiasm.

"Okay," Zhao Xu thought for a moment before agreeing.

Capturing beasts without a fight is probably more suitable for Zheng Xin's current level. He was also introducing the basics of wilderness survival to the other party.

The poet was delighted that Zhao Xu accepted the proposal without haggling, and quickly introduced the two to the leader of their team, a 3rd-level warrior named Big Hammer Cuck.

After a brief introduction and explanation of their adventure goal, the team set off in a hurry, aiming to return before the rainstorm.

As they walked, the scout in the lead glanced at Zhao Xu and asked, "You two are going on an adventure, leaving the elderly and children at home?"

He's a savvy person in the camp, familiar with many adventurers, but didn't recognize the two. He took the opportunity to ask some questions.

"Ah, you haven't noticed that Little Yun is just a high school student in appearance, and the two of you are just a couple, so where are the children?" a nearby forest ranger retorted.

She was initially depressed after childbirth, but her husband encouraged her to enter this game, and unexpectedly, it brought her good fortune.

The team leader was also her husband, and in this camp, the couple was already over 30 years old.

Zhao Xu and Zheng Xin had gained a reputation in this camp due to the goddess's miraculous appearance, and they were simply referred to as "Little Xia" and "Little Yun".
Here is the translation of the text:

"Lan'er, I've already told you twice, we're not a couple, we're just going on an adventure together," Zheng Xin'an explained.

"Hehe, I understand, I understand," Lan'er smiled and chuckled.

"However, Xin'an, what was your affiliation with a certain Arthurian force or player union before? We have an old friend who has persistently held onto a single account, and all the magical items on their body are not as valuable as yours. Or is there some connection at home?"

It's rare for someone to come out and go on an adventure in the wilderness at this time, at least they must be a meticulous person with a three-part hand.

From this brief journey, everyone could see that this young girl had no experience at all.

It's impossible for her to have obtained this magical armor that looks like it's worth several thousand gold coins by herself.

The conversation was laced with an air of inquiry.

"My equipment is given to me by the team leader," Zheng Xin'an said frankly.

"Oh?"

Everyone's gaze suddenly turned to Zhao Xu, realizing that this silent man was indeed a true master of hidden strength.

Zhao Xu had used the "Invisible Magic Light" spell to make his numerous magical items appear plain and ordinary, and even the Aethereia stone on his head was hidden.

Not even a "Magic Detection" spell could detect any unusual aura.

"It seems that you're going on an adventure with your sister. You must be quite talented," the wanderer in front said directly.

"Too much praise," Zhao Xu didn't say much.

In fact, he was planning to create some "crisis" to teach Zheng Xin'an a field operation.

At this moment, the team leader, Kuk, spoke up, "Since we're all here, it's fate that we've met. Why don't we discuss the characteristics of the monsters we might encounter in the wilderness and supplement each other's knowledge? This way, we won't be wasting our time gathering together."
When Coach Cook made this proposal, everyone suddenly responded with great enthusiasm.

In reality, a clear indication of whether one has entered a circle is whether there is "information exchange" and whether one can know some gossip inside the circle.

In the circle, each person has their own "information advantage" based on their social status and profession, and everyone needs others' "information".

This "information" is essentially the ticket and chips in the circle. If someone only asks for information without giving anything in return, they will gradually be ignored at gatherings.

The biggest difference between players and civilians is that they have formed a closed-loop circle.

Civilians have no valuable information to provide to players, but players can supplement each other.

As the highest-level 3rd-level player in the team, Cook can provide information with the most possibilities.

Naturally, he took the initiative to propose and immediately received everyone's response.

Even if they didn't gain anything, knowing some monster information is a gain.

At this moment, the old-fashioned and honest Cook said, "Let the two new companions speak first, and I'll follow up."

Zhao Xu heard this and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow slightly.

When everyone spoke, they naturally wouldn't repeat what others had said.

So, the first to speak would definitely have an advantage, and even using some old information to bluff would work. As the coach, Cook didn't smile, but he was looking out for the two newcomers.

As he designated them as the first and second, he could only put himself last to balance everyone.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu immediately sensed his husband's intentions and gave him a cold stare, muttering under her breath, "You're always trying to be a good person, aren't you?"

Since that's the case, I'll finish saying what I have to say and include Xiao Yun's share too."

Zhao Xu understood that this was also a great opportunity to teach his teammates in real-time.

He revealed to the players that these monsters were scattered around the area, and they would naturally share this information with others. These strategies could spread quickly.

As the players thought Zhao Xu was thinking deeply, he had already used his knowledge (geography) skills to understand the distribution of monsters nearby.

"The vicious mouse is a type of biological creature that is much larger than ordinary mice. They are small and agile, but numerous. However, they are vulnerable to players and can be killed by stepping on them. Just be careful not to get too close and avoid their biting diseases."

The players nodded in agreement as Zhao Xu introduced the vicious mouse.

Due to their numerous population, the vicious mouse had become a common dish on many players' tables over the past few weeks, making it a rare meat supplement.

However, Zhao Xu did not stop there.

"As for the goblins, dog-headed people, and other creatures in this barren land, although they are not numerous, there are still some. They often gather in groups, skilled at long-range attacks, and are not a threat if taken individually. However, a single arrow can take them down. It's best to scout ahead, and a single sleep spell can take care of them. Just be careful not to get caught off guard, as they often set traps in the wilderness. Long-range attacks can be effective, and you can jump over obstacles when necessary."

At this point, Zhao Xu spoke briefly without boasting, but the players already understood.
Here is the translation:

Standing before them is likely a seasoned "team commander" with rich experience!
Such powerful individuals should be fighting alongside the entire adventure team, not leaving them to face danger alone. Even so, it's unbelievable that they allowed them to face danger alone.

For a moment, everyone was filled with anticipation, looking at Zhao Xu.

Even Cook couldn't help but ask, "What should we do if we encounter them? Are there any tactics we can use?"

Zhao Xu frowned slightly, having truly only fought a few times. Because these enemies were too low-level, he hadn't paid much attention to them since he started adventuring.

Luckily, he quickly recalled his past adventuring experiences and immediately explained.

"Most of them are broken houses, with no need for reckless attacks. We can either charge in quickly, ensuring one attack and one retreat, while threatening another. Or we can engage in a defensive battle, using our surroundings to our advantage and exploiting our opponent's low accuracy."

"As for these beastmen, they are better equipped, and it's difficult for small teams to resist them. Fortunately, they are not vigilant, and since they fear the light, they rarely deploy large-scale operations during the day. We can maintain a distance and use ranged attacks, or use long-range attacks like javelins to counterattack, which is very effective."

"However, these beastmen also like to flock together, making them vulnerable to area-of-effect spells like 'Rainbow' and 'Sleep'. However, these three are all innate abilities that are easily evolved, making it difficult to identify them. The three major killers of low-level times are the Dog-Faced Sorcerer, the Dwarf Ranger, and the Beastman Warrior. If we're not careful, we might encounter a Dog-Faced Sorcerer's magic storm and be killed by a 5th-level warrior."

As Zhao Xu spoke, he glanced at Zheng Xin'an beside him.

"These monsters all have a desire to capture prisoners, so if we're actually captured, suicide is a better option."
