Chapter 147: Advanced Magic Technique

The next day, Zhao Xu logged in and was about to go find An Tiya to discuss the arrangement for the next day. However, after the emergency meeting last night, An Tiya left a message saying she would be away for a few days. This meant that Zhao Xu would have to learn the advanced magic technique on his own for the next few days. According to An Tiya, Zhao Xu would only be considered a formal 3rd-level mage after mastering the advanced magic technique.

As a result, An Tiya had already set up a "Portal" magic technique for Zhao Xu to follow the previous experience and enter the final scroll from the projection space. Looking at the note with An Tiya's message, Zhao Xu couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

Without An Tiya's guidance, Zhao Xu would have to rely on the back door to enter the true body of the final scroll. It felt a bit unbelievable. However, the note had an intentional code from An Tiya, which Zhao Xu couldn't fake. He used that code to decipher that a mysterious space would appear 3 hours later behind the bookshelf in An Tiya's waiting room.

Zhao Xu was worried because An Tiya said the content of the projection would be different from the previous time, and he would have to be mentally prepared. Missing this opportunity would mean he would have to wait until An Tiya returned to learn the 2nd-level magic technique. Zhao Xu knew this was probably a test from An Tiya, and he quickly reviewed and re-prepared all the zero-level and first-level magic techniques he had consumed the day before within the 3-hour timeframe.
"The Phase Gate" is a spell that establishes a spiritual channel between stone walls, it does not have a time limit, but rather a limit on the number of uses. Generally, only the spellcaster can pass through, but Antinoya deliberately set Zhao Xu's name as a condition for passage. When the time was almost up, Zhao Xu approached the bookcase and felt the faint appearance of the phase gate. Zhao Xu stared at the countdown on the clock, and as soon as the moment arrived, he charged straight in. In a daze, Zhao Xu found himself in the same mysterious space as last time, with no windows and completely enclosed. The difference was that last time the room had twelve mirrors, but this time there were none. The room was empty, like a cubic box. Zhao Xu had wondered what kind of mysterious and special test awaited him this time, but he hadn't expected there to be nothing at all. Last time, he had found the correct mirror and entered the innermost part of the final scroll. But now, Zhao Xu was no longer the warrior of his past life, and everything had to be solved using brute force. Now he had many first-level spells, limited in number but completely different in meaning. Zhao Xu stood in the corner of the room and cast "Detect Magic" into the wide space ahead. When he finished chanting, the nearly 20-meter radius cone of detection energy spread out instantly. But when Zhao Xu looked at the spiritual feedback brought by the spell, he was almost blinded and quickly canceled the spell. "Why did I think of casting Detect Magic in the projection of the artifact?" Zhao Xu patted his head. The intensity of the spiritual light detected by Detect Magic ranged from the lowest level of dimness to medium, strong, and dazzling.

Not even a nine-level persistent spell can be as strong as this. Only legendary spells or divine artifacts can emit a blindingly brilliant light.

He was right in the projection of the final scroll, and even if it was just a part of the divine artifact, it couldn't help but emit a blindingly brilliant light.

Zhao Xu stretched out his hand to feel the position he had just entered, only to find that the upper dimensional portal had already disappeared.

The projection space had shifted to a new location, naturally breaking off the connection with its original location.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but circle around the four walls of the sealed room, trying to find a clue from above.

However, when he returned to the starting point, he still found nothing.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's eyes lit up, and he immediately took out the note left by An Ti Noya.

As expected, the content of the note had changed by then.

"Remember to carry the note with you, and it's as if you know my things shouldn't be lost."

Zhao Xu wrinkled his mouth, as if he couldn't help but wonder, An Ti Noya would even throw away a piece of scrap paper and put it in the box containing the six-level spell "Separation" to clear it away. She was naturally fastidious and didn't want others to touch her things.

Then the note began to change its content: "You only need to say 'I want to answer' and the projection space will start asking you a question, and then you can answer it to pass through. Pay attention to the details."

It turned out to be an examination?
However, Zhao Xu didn't care; answering questions could be considered the safest activity.

He directly opened his mouth and said, "I want to answer."

Suddenly, the entire projection space began to emit a loud rumbling noise, and a mirror slowly appeared from thin air and slowly descended in front of Zhao Xu.

Then the mirror began to display a sentence...
Here is the translation of the text:

One hundred wizards were separately imprisoned in one hundred small rooms. Each day, one wizard would be randomly selected to be released into the grand hall. The hall had a magical lamp that could be turned on or off, but it left no trace. If all the wizards could confirm that everyone had been to the hall, they would be released; otherwise, they would all be executed. Before being imprisoned, the wizards had agreed on a plan to ensure that everyone had been to the hall. The question was what the plan was.

Zhao Xiu saw this question and couldn't help but laugh. He said that modern logic problems often set up obstacles, and that the magical lamp could be simplified as each person having a ball. Every time someone went out, they would throw the ball into a box. When one person saw that there were 99 balls of other people, it would naturally prove that everyone had been there.

"One wizard is responsible for turning off the lamp, and the other 99 wizards are responsible for turning it on. After the one responsible for turning off the lamp closes it 99 times, he can confirm that everyone has been there," Zhao Xiu said simply.

However, a mirror in front of him suddenly appeared with a row of text - "Wrong answer".

Followed by a countdown timer appearing below the mirror, counting down from 10.

10.
9.
...

At the moment the timer reached zero, Zhao Xiu was about to be kicked out of the space.

In an instant, Zhao Xiu regained his composure.

He knew that his entire thought process was correct, but there was still a flaw in the logic.

Just as the mirror's red countdown timer was constantly decreasing, it had already reached 5 seconds.

Zhao Xiu clenched his fist, his eyebrows furrowed, and he re-read the entire question again.

His attention was still focused on the lamp, as if he was lost in thought.

However, time would not wait, and the countdown timer instantly changed to 3 seconds.

2 seconds.

1 second.

"The remaining 99 people all turned on the lamp twice and turned it off 198 times, which proves that everyone has been there."
Zhao Xun quickly finished speaking without even gasping for breath.

As soon as he finished speaking, a burst of yellow light erupted from the mirror, sucking Zhao Xun in.

When Zhao Xun opened his eyes again, he found himself back in the circular library with stacks of spell books reaching to the sky.

He couldn't help but take a breath and finally answered.

Because it was uncertain whether the lights were on or off at the beginning, the person who turned off the light at the beginning might have actually turned off a light that was already on, so he would miss a person, which is why he had to change it to everyone turning on the lights twice to avoid the initial state.

At this point, the list of spells began to appear on his retina, and Zhao Xun couldn't help but sigh as he looked at them.

Sure enough, the second-level spells were much stronger than the first-level spells.

Especially when he saw the description of the "Ghost Strike" spell, he almost shook his head in amazement at its overwhelming power.

This spell could make the recipient's attack weapon semi-transparent, thereby ignoring armor and even innate defenses, and directly trampling a warrior's armor into the ground.

Even strategic spells like Invisibility began to appear in the second-level spells.

Things that are so difficult to obtain, like the second-level spell "Spirit Possession," could temporarily give him a warrior's expertise.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xun didn't care and directly summoned a list of all the second-level arcane spells to study.

In this scroll space, Zhao Xun, just like last time, basically transcribed each second-level spell into his inner self in less than a minute.

And this time, Zhao Xun felt a different feeling as he transcribed.
Those spells seemed to start becoming a part of his body, slowly merging with him. Zhao Xu also began to realize that the spells he had just transcribed into his heart were actually remembered very clearly. Even the spell structures that had been quite difficult for him to understand before seemed much clearer now. Zhao Xu began to gain a certain sensitivity to magic. It was very vague, but it was faintly present in his heart. In the end, after successfully transcribing almost ninety-nine percent of the second-level arcane spells, Zhao Xu couldn't help but relax and let out a sigh. Unfortunately, he would have to do it all over again when he learned second-level divine magic in the future. This time it was just a simple light bulb switching task, but the next time, who knows what the difficulty will be. Zhao Xu couldn't help but frown. If he transcribed the second-level divine magic now, wouldn't it save him the trouble later? Thinking of this, Zhao Xu directly summoned the "Wings of Protection" spell from the list. Antinoya had used this spell to summon invisible wings that had blocked one of his attacks. Later, Zhao Xu learned about the power of this spell, which was a conceptual block against attacks regardless of their nature. Unfortunately, this was a second-level arcane spell exclusive to warlocks, and mages couldn't learn it. Antinoya had learned the divine magic version of "Wings of Protection" through the characteristics of the scroll scholar. Zhao Xu looked at the "Wings of Protection" spell spread out in front of him, trying to transcribe it into his heart. At this point, the second-level divine magic was transcribed into Zhao Xu's heart without any obstacles, as if he had transcribed it before. It's just that Zhao Xu didn't have a second-level divine magic slot, so even if he transcribed it, he couldn't use the spell. But it also meant that he could save himself a trip.
Here is the translation:

As Zhao Xu thought about it, he involuntarily summoned the spellbook of the third-grade arcane "Fireball" with greed. Is it possible that he can finish copying all the spells today?
