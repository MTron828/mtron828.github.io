Chapter 635: Butterfly Effect, Narrow Road Encounter

This method that can easily destroy the world, with a low difficulty level, is a combination of one-ring magic and two specialized skills. Even a 3rd-level wizard can achieve this by customizing.

As Zhao Xu read about this ancient text in the floating library, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. It was no wonder that the two skills produced in the land of frost and fire would disappear into oblivion in the long river of history.

It's like a child playing with a treasure worth tens of thousands, only to find death. Even Zhao Xu suspected that every person who mastered these two skills was being watched and monitored by the Goddess of Magic.

Therefore, even after Zhao Xu reached level 10 and obtained a super-magic skill through the 2nd-level magic shield, he still didn't choose the "Frost and Fire" skill.

The danger within made him only dare to keep a distance.

If he really wanted to use it, he would probably be killed by the divine power on the spot.

It was Zhao Xu who actually used this technique in the dream world.

Before using the "Selective Magic" he had mastered, he would decide what race would not be harmed or would only be harmed. If he used it, both sides would suffer the same fate. Even if he revealed the low-level implementation method, the consequences would be even more severe.

Without thinking, Arthur's will would immediately correct him.

After thinking it through, Zhao Xu could only dare to use it in his dream world.
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, a gust of icy air burst forth from Zhao Xu's hand, chilling the air. The cold air spread rapidly, as if a toxic gas had been released, spreading outward from his position and racing towards the far distance. On a sweltering summer day, the air was thick with heat and humidity, making pedestrians feel like they were about to suffocate. But now, the air was filled with a biting cold wind, and the heat and humidity seemed to dissipate instantly. People on the street suddenly felt their bodies stiffen, as if they had been frozen in an ice cube. Zhao Xu gazed at the scene with an icy gaze, as if he had been waiting for this moment. He was about to test the limits of his abilities in this dream world. Suddenly, the entire street was filled with people lying motionless on the ground, as if they had been struck by Zhao Xu's experiment. These ordinary people had lost their lives in his experiment, and not a single cry or scream was heard. The silence was oppressive, and the only sound was the buzzing of insects.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the moment when the search waves emitted by the urban positioning technique swept through, bringing with them the icy power of the frost spell, all the lives in the dream world were instantly extinguished. Moreover, the scale of hundreds of kilometers further drained the land of all vitality.

Zhao Xu was aware that these lives were not real, but he still felt a faint "palpitation" in his heart.

At that moment, he seemed to sense the fluttering of countless souls. Despite knowing that this was not real, he still felt a tingling sensation on his scalp.

This was a true, merciless killing.

After completing this "killing spree", Zhao Xu's eyes were cold and icy, without the slightest hint of joy or satisfaction that came with completing a great creation and verifying its effectiveness.

From the day he became a mage, Zhao Xu had felt himself drawing closer to the realm of the "non-human". It was as if all worldly affairs had detached themselves from his scope of concern. He was like a stay-at-home husband who didn't need to worry about anything, as long as he just went with the flow.

The next second, Zhao Xu lifted his toes and disappeared instantly from the desolate peak.

The teleportation technique, which controlled the power to tear apart space, allowed him to instantly traverse the vast distances between cities on Earth, as if he had mastered the art of shrinking the distance to a mere inch. With one step, he could cover nearly a hundred kilometers.

Traveling, which was originally a time- and energy-consuming task for ordinary people, became a seamless and smooth experience in Zhao Xu's eyes, like watching a big-screen movie. However, he had also witnessed the scene of hundreds of millions of people dying.
Here is the translation:

Death has become as natural as breathing at this moment.

The faces of countless lives just before death, like a masterpiece of fine art, are deeply etched in Zhao Xu's mind, presenting the final moments of life.

However, this world remains intact and unscathed.

Even Zhao Xu has sensed that countless places on earth have already detected the vacuum left by this life, but it will take at least a few hours for them to arrive and investigate the entire incident.

But for him, who has already felt a sense of detachment, it's of no consequence.

Although Lark's "Death God" fragment was taken away, the imprint of the former god's aura still deeply resides within his body.

When the "Spirits' Tides" erupted on earth, Zhao Xu suddenly burst forth, ignoring all obstacles, to exhibit his divine power, begging the blessing of the magic goddess Sylvina.

It also served as a deterrent.

If it had continued as it was, he might have become the Death God itself.

"I suddenly know who you are."

At this moment, Zhao Xu is suspended in mid-air, and the sky above has turned dark and foreboding, like a sea of black ink poured onto the canvas, layer upon layer.

(Note: I've translated the text as accurately as possible, but please note that some nuances and cultural references might be lost in translation.)
Here is the translation of the text:

The thunderous sound of thunder resounded, and a flash of lightning illuminated the dark sky. The city below, situated amidst the rolling hills, was bathed in a blue-violet glow. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck, heading straight for Zhao Xú. It was a merciless attack.

Zhao Xú remained calm, his expression unchanged, as he subtly manipulated his hands to prepare for a counterattack. The next moment, the "Heavenly Sword" in his possession suddenly shot out of his grasp, entering the cleansing waters of the lightning.

The sound of the "Heavenly Sword" finally ceased, leaving behind an eerie silence. The sword then began to resonate with a low hum, speaking in a voice that echoed through the air.

"You're saying I'm yours?"

"I've never shown any weakness from start to finish. I even helped you awaken the White Crow clan's martial arts. Why do you still doubt me?"

"And what about the fact that I didn't suspect anything from the beginning to just now, and you received the power of the heavens? And what about the fact that it has nothing to do with me? Why did you suddenly awaken to this?"

Zhao Xú couldn't help but frown.

"The reason is simple."

"I've detected the status of the wizards. They're not strong enough to cause chaos, but they still did. They didn't follow the script, so you suspect me of causing trouble?"

The Heavenly Sword responded, its voice low and hoarse.

"That's right. I suspect someone is trying to pull the wool over my eyes. Do you know my prophecies, divination, and magical arts? But they're all directly connected to the goddess Sylvia."

"This doesn't prove anything!"

The Heavenly Sword declared, its voice muffled.
So, the goddess of fate saw me and the warlock battling, but it didn't actually happen in the end. As I said that, I raised an eyebrow, "Have you ever played chess? Divination is essentially simulating the game based on the current situation, so it can't escape reality."

"But when the warlock appeared, it was the last critical move in the game, and it was a decisive checkmate. At that moment, everything was futile. You want to tell me that you suddenly decided to use the warlock's power?" The person who had witnessed countless years of "Paradise" finally understood and said, "So, I have to intervene only before the game begins."

"That is, I have to start setting up my pieces the moment you see the prophecy." "That is, you can infer that I actually read your memories, so I know about the existence of 'prophecy'." "That's right." Zhao Xuan nodded, and speaking to a wise person is indeed convenient.

"But I didn't sense it at all!" At this point, the person in Paradise let out an unbelievable voice.

"I know you can sense my thoughts, so I deliberately didn't think about it." Zhao Xuan shook his head, "I'm carrying a hidden eye, and the only possible explanation is that it's within the protected range of the hidden eye, which is my magical items."

"What?" "Not thinking, but still quietly deducing?"

Zhao Xuan also had a hint of disappointment.

In his past life, his family was destroyed, and he wandered around, strengthening himself while collecting information about the black dragon.

Therefore, it was destined that Zhao Xuan could not be like some losers who self-destruct, drunk and idle.

But when awake, he had to face such deep pain and such pain that could only be alleviated by time.

So Zhao Xuan had cultivated the ability to deliberately not think about something using his superficial thoughts during that period.
Here is the translation:

In his subconscious, he still relied on his ability to guess the target without thinking. It was as if he was recalling a lesson by reading a sentence and then forgetting it. He would then recall it through his natural thinking. This efficiency may seem slow, but he often finished memorizing the lesson quickly and didn't worry about forgetting it the next day.

"Since I told you, don't you think you should introduce yourself first?" he said, his tone calm and refined.

Zhao Xu was no longer in a hurry, but rather exuded an air of elegance.

"I have a strange feeling, why can you link me to Death?" "Obviously, you're a legendary weapon with a long history. Don't you remember your original shape was a heavy sword? Before that, you could have been a giant scythe or something else, which wouldn't be strange at all."

"You're right."

At that moment, the other person's expression became more open.

"That's right, I'm called the Human Heaven, and my previous master was the former Spirit God, Corallon. Later, I became the weapon of Death, so what you see me as now, a long sword, is not an unusual thing."

Corallon, a powerful god with a history that dates back to ancient times.

Zhao Xu couldn't help but recall the precise description he saw in the legendary library about the opponent - Corallon Ralisan, the creator and protector of the spirits, with a background in magic, high-level magic, music, art, craftsmanship, and poetry.
Here is the translation of the text:

It is said that the blood of the elf tribe, mixed with the blood of the beast god and the tears of the goddess of the three moons, gave birth to a being. Compared to the legendary "Ernest" who once dominated the entire Arthurian world, the history of the elf god Correlian is indeed more authentic.

The first wife of the king, Arphos, is actually a powerful force - the spider queen, who was banished to the bottomless abyss by Correlian and renamed as Thanatos, the evil demon. Upon hearing this, Zhao Xu's hair stood on end.

So, it seems that the "ancient weapon" is actually a shield for the "paradise on earth".

Even saying that it's a divine artifact is a bit of an insult to the other party's dignity.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xu couldn't help but complain about the old man Weng's failure to obtain a high-level magic crystal.

"Don't worry," said the king of the "paradise on earth". "After Ernest severed my relationship with the elf god, our relationship was not as deep as you think. Otherwise, I would not have become the god of death's weapon."

As he spoke, the king of the "paradise on earth" let out a bitter sigh. "However, I don't have any ill intentions towards you. It's just that I've noticed that the god of death's footsteps are approaching this land, so I've rushed to use the power of the devil's device to pull you into this dream world."

"What about the god of death?"

"No, it was its leftover legacy - a body that can be revived. Although the revived body is not the true him. Therefore, I must intervene before he arrives to prevent you from meeting him."

"Compared to the god of death's aura left on your body, my previous self is more attractive to its gaze."

But I'm sure the previous self didn't appear at all, did it?

At this moment, Zhao Xu's heart was filled with curiosity.
However, he soon realized it.

This point was actually strange because the artificial god of death was the one he had awakened.
