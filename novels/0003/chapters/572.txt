Chapter 573: The Chosen of God, Miracles of God

Zhao Xu turned around to see a woman priest in a pure white vestment standing behind him, her demeanor calm and composed.

Although Zhao Xu could tell that the other person was of a certain age from her facial features, he couldn't help but be charmed by her warm and gentle smile.

"May I introduce myself?" the priestess said with a slight bow, her voice soft and melodious. "I am Nia, the priestess of the Magic Goddess."

Zhao Xu returned the bow and replied, "I've heard of you."

Nia smiled slightly and said, "I thought that young priests like you wouldn't recognize me, especially someone as busy as you, Mr. Zhong Xue."

Zhao Xu smiled awkwardly.

Earlier, when he was undergoing priest training, the Archbishop had given him a book and told him to read it carefully, as it would help him complete his training quickly. Although Zhao Xu had finished reading the book in half a day, he still remembered the book - it was the biography of Nia, the former Pope.

Or rather, it was the biography of the former Pope.

As it turned out, Nia was also a priest who had given up some of her priestly abilities and converted them into knowledge-based abilities.

But how did Nia, the former Pope, not ascend to heaven?

Zhao Xu's mind flashed back to the biography he had skimmed through earlier, his 29-point intelligence allowing him to quickly recall the scene.

Although he had only glanced at the book briefly, his excellent memory allowed him to recall the scene vividly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hehe," Pastor Mei said with a smile, and the nearby forest seemed to burst into life, radiating a powerful aura of vitality.

"Ah, Mr. Zhongxia, your gaze is just like looking back at my memoir, trying to find a suitable topic to discuss," Pastor Mei said with a sly glance.

Pastor Mei scowled at Zhao Xu, saying, "That book was written by someone else after I reached the divine realm. Although the priestess of the goddess is honest to some extent, I've also added a lot of embellishments, making me look too good."

"So, Mr. Zhongxia, if you use the words from that book to praise me, I'll be embarrassed."

Pastor Mei's quick-witted remark transformed the awkwardness into nothingness.

"This kind of skill also made Zhao Xu straighten up, waiting for the next move.

"Ah, Pastor Mei, you're here to deliver the goddess's decree, aren't you?" Zhao Xu asked, curious.

Pastor Mei, the priestess, didn't have a single word of idle chatter.

It's not clear who will become the goddess's apostle tomorrow or the next day, or maybe even a fiery angel.

Pastor Mei appeared before the priestess of the goddess, receiving a welcome that wasn't much different from that of the current pope.

So Zhao Xu didn't believe that Pastor Mei would come to see him without a reason.

"I'm naturally here to solve Mr. Zhongxia's worries, or maybe I was sent by the goddess," Pastor Mei said, bowing slightly towards Zhao Xu, as if apologizing.

"Because the goddess thinks that if she appears this time, you might directly agree without considering the risks behind, so I was sent as a middleman."

"Uh-huh."
Zhao Xu surveyed the surroundings, quietly casting a detection spell to shield himself from disturbances and gather information. Then, he nodded to suggest that Pastor Meiya continue speaking.

"Before we begin discussing topics," Pastor Meiya asked with a smile, "I'd like to ask Mr. Zhongxia what he knows about my current identity?"

Zhao Xu carefully examined Pastor Meiya again, but the "spirit shield" spell on her body blocked all his detection and divination spells, even his psychic powers. He thought for a moment before responding in a speculative tone, "Elector?"

Pastor Meiya immediately covered her mouth, saying, "Ah, I remember that the Lady of Anniya used to tease Mr. Zhongxia, saying he was silly. It seems that the Lady was just joking, and Mr. Zhongxia's thought process is indeed very fast. He must be worthy of the gods' attention."

Zhao Xu, who had been at the center of the conversation, was taken aback and began to think deeply.

The term "Elector" refers to the representatives of the gods in the Arthurian world, and their will is the will of the gods. Positions like "Pope," "Cardinal," and "Archbishop" are more ceremonial and do not carry any real power. For example, Zhao Xu, as the president of the Mage Association, may not gain any new powers from the position, but rather relies on the association's reputation.

However, Electors are different. They possess powers granted by the gods.

When the time of the gods' twilight arrives, Electors become the vanguard of the gods in the Arthurian world. Therefore, the gods are extremely cautious when selecting each Elector.
Here is the translation:

"It is both glory and gift, as well as trust and dependence.

"This time, I come to visit Mr. Zhongxia, and I'm here to ask you if you're willing to become the chosen one of our goddess, Sylvina, and a follower of our faith."

Priestess Mia's tone suddenly became urgent, as if she couldn't pause for a moment, "Before I say anything, I need to make it clear what kind of abilities and powers you'll gain after becoming a chosen one."

"First of all, you'll be able to summon the powers of our local churches, but you can't defy the teachings of our goddess."

"Next, you'll gain the following special abilities. You can think of yourself as a 'template'."

"First, Reward Magic: From one to nine circles, you can choose one spell from each circle to become your own magic ability, and you can use it once a day."

"Second, Magic Immunity: From one to nine circles, you can choose one spell from each circle, and it will have the effect of 'Magic Immunity', ignoring the effects of the spells you've chosen."

After hearing this, Zhao Xu nodded, and he could now obtain a nine-circle spell, which was not bad at all. After all, the Book of Heaven won't last forever.

As for the Magic Immunity, although it seems insignificant now, it is still very powerful, because Zhao Xu can continue to stack the eight-circle spell "Higher Magic Immunity" every four levels, adding one extra immunity to one spell.

At this point, Mia continued to say, "As a chosen one, you'll also be immune to aging, diseases, separation, and toxins. From now on, you won't need to sleep, but you'll still need 8 hours of rest to prepare your magic."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The voters also bring their own detection magic effects, and activating the 'Silver Flame' ability, the uses of which are countless, and you can explore them by yourself. The remaining points will allow your physique to increase by 10 points."

Nia said solemnly, looking at Zhao Xu, "To be honest, Mr. Zhongxia, the goddess doesn't need an answer from you now."

"And I also think that when you genuinely want to protect your magic and resist the evil forces of Arthur, that moment will become even more meaningful when you become a 'Goddess's Voter'."

As Nia spoke, her gaze seemed to pierce through Zhao Xu's heart.

Zhao Xu also nodded silently.

Zhao Xu, who had too many attachments, didn't have an exaggerated increase in physique from being a voter.
However, for other mages, it could be said that it was a significant increase.

Even now, Zhao Xu didn't have a good way to increase his physique, and unlike the voter template, which would give him a direct 10-point increase in HP.

As for Zhao Xu, who had accumulated over 300 points of life value, he ignored all the laws that judged by life value.

If he had crossed over before, Zhao Xu would definitely take up the voter without hesitation.

With an extra bit of power, he could hope to live a bit longer.

But now, under the shadow of the Twilight of the Gods, he had to preserve his life.

Because he was no longer alone.

Behind him was an entire nation, and he couldn't afford to be careless.

"Mr. Zhongxia," Nia suddenly took a step closer to Zhao Xu, her hand reaching out to tightly grasp his chest.

Feeling the pulsation of the heart position.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If you hastily agree, I'll actually feel that you're not very reliable, and you haven't realized the gravity and enormity of the situation. And so, the goddess has left you three miracles that are boundless in power, or rather, 'divine miracles'."

"When Mr. Zhou, you want to become a chosen one at that moment, you'll exhaust these three divine miracles, and at that moment, you'll become the goddess's chosen one."

"May the glory of the Lord be with you always." As Pastor Xia said this, he turned around and walked away, preparing to leave.

But just a moment later, Zhao Xu pressed his palm to his chest.

He wasn't going to become a chosen one immediately; that was his own thought, and it was far from being a legendary chosen one, which would be embarrassing to mention.

But activating a divine miracle immediately was his attitude.

Zhao Xu gazed at the gray and hazy sky and exclaimed loudly.

"I implore the goddess to bestow a miracle."
"I pray that every Earth-crosser who dies in a desolate land will receive an extra set of clothing to wrap themselves in, and thus be protected from rain, wind, and cold."

Instantly, Zhao Xu's voice, affected by divine power, slowly spread out and entered the ears of every Earth-crosser.
