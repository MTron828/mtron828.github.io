Chapter 519: Faith in Death, the Departed's Last Words

"What are you going to do?" the team leader scolded, looking at Zhao Xu as he slowly walked into the room where the corpse lay.

After the initial chaos had subsided, the night patrol team had arrived and managed to regain control of the situation. No one was allowed to intervene carelessly.

However, Zhao Xu casually raised his hand with the mage's badge, causing the team leader to be taken aback for a few seconds.

Zhao Xu then knelt down and looked at the corpse, whose face had turned completely pale.

Ordinary people rarely get to see a corpse, unless it's in the event of a car accident or the death of a loved one. However, in Aria, even players who normally only watch the game's scenery without participating in battles won't see corpses often.

Aria is not a peaceful and serene paradise.

Zhao Xu put on his gloves and observed the corpse.

As a result of his research into the "medical" skill due to his priest level, he was performing a basic examination.

The autopsy official who had been trying to stop Zhao Xu was taken aback by this scene and mistakenly thought he was also an autopsy official, not taking any further action.

"Master," Lark said suddenly, her voice full of warmth.

"What's wrong?" Zhao Xu asked, surprised.

"Why haven't you taken care of your followers lately?" Lark lectured Zhao Xu, speaking in a righteous tone.

"Do you mean Aria?"
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu's expression suddenly changed, "I was surrounded by a crowd of people all day, and now it's midnight. There's no way she'll leave alone with her in the room to chat." "And to think that now it's half past midnight, she's probably already logged off and gone to sleep."

"Ah, you're kidding me, Big Tree," Laksis said with a raised tone, "Are you preparing to become the Grim Reaper yourself if you don't gather some followers?"

Zhao Xu's heart skipped a beat when he heard this.

Tiamat and Bahamut, the dragon gods, may not be extremely powerful, but their ability to survive is rare in this world. They have gone through three twilight eras and have remained still to this day. On the other hand, various gods related to death, such as the "God of Slaughter", "God of Assassination", "God of Conflict", and "God of the Dead", have been constantly changing.

The death gods seem to have been born with a curse from the gods.

As a naturally born "divine occupation" that can control death, they have not yet taken control of it.

From the current Arthur's perspective, each god has their own part of the pie, and no one dares to take bold action.

"Laksis, I feel like I've entered a trap when I meet you," Zhao Xu said as he checked the dead man's mouth with his gloved hands, muttering to himself, "Now that I have the fragments of the death god's essence, you're urging me to quickly consolidate my followers."

"But at least let me know what kind of fish I'm fishing for," he added.

Laksis listened and seemed a bit embarrassed, "Well, I was also in a state of consolidation and exploration before, so I couldn't tell you everything. But now I've basically become clear."

"Go first and consolidate Zheng Xin's basic plate, and let her know who she really is," he said to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu couldn't help but ask, "Is it you who brought her to the Starlight Town?"

"Ha ha, yes. It's because this matter should have been done earlier by you, but I'm curious why you didn't take action after accepting the other party," he said with a smile.

Zhao Xu felt a sense of bitterness in his heart, but he didn't explain it to Lark.

In his past life, Zheng Xin'an was the one who died in Starlight Town.

Deep in his heart, he had a kind of "hesitation" towards the repetition of fate.

"That's tomorrow," Zhao Xu said. "I'll go and have a talk with her then."

"Ah!" Lark suddenly let out a mournful cry.

The people around them also saw Zhao Xu's sudden shock and thought he had found a crucial clue, so they couldn't help but look at him with curiosity.

"What's wrong again?" Zhao Xu was helpless.

"Master, if you're going to face Zheng Xin'an as the Summer Solstice tomorrow, I guarantee you'll never be able to consolidate this believer," Lark warned.

"That's true," Zhao Xu realized in his heart.

It was too familiar, so it was natural that he wouldn't have a sense of reverence.

It was just like he was too familiar with Anzino, and it was hard for him to have the admiration of an outsider towards a legendary mage.

Zhao Xu was absolutely a "superficial believer" when it came to the Goddess of Magic.

"Besides, if you go yourself, I guarantee you'll be waiting for yourself to be nailed to the position of God of Death," Lark warned.

"So, starting from now, you need to create a 'doppelganger' of the God of Death, including bestowing divine blessings on Zheng Xin'an, and you need to execute it through this form."
Here is the translation of the text:

"As the leaves of the believers spread out, you can remotely control the 'false death god' and conduct your affairs. Even if this death god is blocked, you can still retreat with your life. However, if such a situation actually occurs, you may only be able to save Zheng Xin Yu, the leader. "

Zhao Xu heard these words, but his expression remained calm. He had realized that if he was a farmer, the believers were like crops in a field. He needed to harvest the crops in the golden season, not deeply love them. This was the most direct relationship between the divine and the believers. He would disseminate divine blessings and offer faith.

Thinking about this, Zhao Xu nodded, "I understand, I will complete this task." With a sense of direction, Zhao Xu's expression returned to normal.

The corpse's wife, however, was crying loudly, her tears even wetting her clothing. "Why not give up?" "What kind of hero are you?" The people on the floor began to feel discontent. "Do you have a plan?" The autopsy expert next to him also noticed that Zhao Xu had some "medical" skills, almost like a doctor, and spoke with a hint of politeness.

"No use." At this moment, the wild man player, with eyes similar to a beast's, walked up behind him, standing behind him.

He seemed to sense the true nature of the case.

"The thinking pattern of beasts is different from ours."
This text is a passage from a fantasy novel and describes a scene where a barbarian player, Zhao Xu, is discussing a murder case with a character named Wildman. Zhao Xu suggests that the murderer may have used a special ability to communicate with the dead, and Wildman is skeptical. Zhao Xu then uses his abilities to demonstrate his powers, including "Instant Spell", "Multitalented Caster", "Silent Spellcasting", and "Concealment Spell". The passage describes how Zhao Xu uses these abilities to make it seem like he is simply tapping his finger, without leaving any visible signs of spellcasting.

Translation:

The barbarian player is essentially the soul of humanity, "receiving discrimination, they will launch a surprise attack, spreading the disease of beastification, expanding the group of infected beastified humans." "Such attacks are usually random and do not leave any traces."

Wildman summarized, "I believe you are clearer than me, the most difficult cases to crack on Earth are often random killings. On the other hand, familiar cases are always solved with ease."

This statement is not complex, and those present nodded unconsciously. This also means that this "murder case" has added another layer of shadow.

Unbeknownst to this, Zhao Xu suddenly turned around and said, "You're right, but I need to ask the deceased."

Wildman heard this and couldn't help but laugh, "Don't be ridiculous, the soul of the deceased has already returned to the realm of the gods. Even if you can transmit to the other world, you wouldn't be able to find the deceased among the countless souls. And by the way, you can't even enter the realm of the gods."

Zhao Xu flashed a white smile, "As a wizard, we exist to make the impossible possible."

"Communicating with the dead?" The autopsy officer beside him couldn't help but shout in surprise, suddenly recalling the possibility.

But he quickly hesitated, "This is a three-ring magic!"

However, Zhao Xu immediately used his abilities, including "Instant Spell", "Multitalented Caster", "Silent Spellcasting", and "Concealment Spell", combining them in a single action.

From the outside, it seemed like he was lightly tapping his finger with a gesture that looked complex.

There was no visible sign of spellcasting, not even for the wizards in the room.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What are the distinguishing features of the person who killed you?" Zhao Xu asked, his gaze fixed on the dead body.

The player, Wan Lang, who was examining the corpse, couldn't help but burst out laughing. "Is this a ritual or some kind of sorcery?" he asked.

As a civilian, Arthur might not be aware of the existence of magic, but adventurers like them knew that magic was real and believed in its power.

"So, what kind of action does the spell require?" the coroner, who was standing beside Zhao Xu, corrected him.

Zhao Xu thought that Wan Lang was pretending to cast a spell, trying to fish out the killer.

However, just the next moment, the corpse, which was lying on the ground, suddenly opened its mouth and made a faint, muffled sound. "It was my wife who killed me."

The woman who was lying on top of the corpse suddenly turned pale and exclaimed in terror, "It wasn't me, it really wasn't me!"

Before anyone could say a word, she stiffened and fell back onto the ground.

At this moment, Wan Lang, the barbarian player, couldn't bear it anymore. He stretched out his powerful arm and grasped Zhao Xu's arm, glaring at him. "I don't know what kind of trick you're pulling, but your behavior towards the deceased is absolutely despicable."

Just then, Zhao Xu didn't flinch at all.

With a natural strength of 18, combined with his half-orc racial adjustment of 2 and a +2 strength belt, Zhao Xu's total strength exceeded 20, crushing most ordinary players.

Wan Lang, unable to accept this scene, clenched his teeth and let out a fierce roar! His "Frenzy" ability, which he was familiar with, granted him a 4-point increase in both physical and mental abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he saw, his entire body looked like it had inflated by a circle, becoming extremely robust and sturdy. Under the support of the 27 points of powerful strength, Anguo was biting his teeth and struggling to pull Zhao Xu to the ground. However, he again found that the man in front of him remained unmoved. Although he was under the effect of his 27 points of strength, he could still topple a not-so-sturdy short wall with ease. Anguo's eyes, which had never shown a "devilish" look before, suddenly displayed one. "Ah!" At this moment, the wife of the deceased let out a terrified scream, as if she couldn't accept the sudden shock.

"You don't need to worry," Anguo said hastily, trying to comfort the other person, but his face changed instantly. Even the crowd watching from the scene also let out a chorus of shocked gasps. Those who were close by stood up and backed away, their legs trembling with fear, in stark contrast to their initial excited demeanor.

As for the woman whose husband had passed away, her head slowly transformed into that of a rat, revealing a pointed and sharp mouth and fine teeth, with whiskers growing on her face.
