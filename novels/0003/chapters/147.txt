Chapter 148: The Second Layer of the Ultimate Scroll's Power

Just as Zhao Xu was trying to guess the possibilities, the spellbook containing the "Fireball" spell suddenly fell in front of him.

Each spell in the Ultimate Scroll represents a spellbook, and the spellbook also has a distinctive feature of the spell.

When the "Fireball" spellbook opened in front of Zhao Xu, the iron-bound cover was still emitting small sparks.

In the underground mine, the curse cannon tower, although created by Lian with illusions, was personally released by Lian with each spell, and its value was genuine.

So Zhao Xu has witnessed the power of the "Fireball" spell up close and personal, and it's like a hand grenade that explodes.

But this time, Zhao Xu was looking at the curse script on the spellbook without a single thought. He then realized that the subtle barrier in the Ultimate Scroll's space had not completely disappeared.

However, Zhao Xu didn't give up. He would try again seven more times.

At that point, he might become the only one who has mastered all the spells in history.

In the secret box of the witch's treasure trove, which was also the past of the "Curse Forest", Zhao Xu realized one thing.

In the Ultimate Scroll space, true wealth is not just about avoiding material costs and copying fees to record spells.

Rather, it's about obtaining all the spells recorded in history, from spells that no one has ever learned to spells that disrupt the balance of the world and are sealed away.

They are all complete in the Ultimate Scroll.

It's not that no mage wants to show off their skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

Only they cannot grasp "wisdom melody" and "skill enhancement", two unpublicized magical arts, like Zhao Xu. Each mage can obtain two free magical arts from the Mage Association after leveling up, and some exceptional mages can even apply for specific magical arts. However, most mages can only access limited core lists. Truly powerful and diverse magical arts are often kept secret.

After Zhao Xu finished his meditation, he was about to leave when he suddenly remembered that Anzhi Noya had come back to find him last time, only to see him still recording magical arts and waited for half an hour before taking him away. The spatial boundary of the scroll space limited external transmission, but did not prohibit internal transmission.

Just like the divine realm, each mage who masters a ninth-level magical art can open the door to the core area of the divine realm. However, the gods can close the door at will. Anzhi Noya took Zhao Xu to the ruins of the Itel kingdom, which follows the same principle. Without Anzhi Noya's permission, no one can transmit to that area.

Zhao Xu lay quietly in his spatial consciousness, with a row of transmission magical arts: transmission, high-level transmission, transmission array, interdimensional transmission, high-level interdimensional transmission, storm walking, earth grasping, city jumping, and domain vortex. None of them is one he can currently perform.

Zhao Xu was troubled by this thought and couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. However, he didn't dwell on it and began to explore the space of the final scroll after some thought.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

From the moment he stepped into this place, he has been busy recording spells into his mind using the ability of "Hue Xin Shi Fa" (Wisdom Heart Master). He basically hasn't explored the surrounding area.

According to An Ti Nia, this space is just a manifestation of the final scroll. Even if someone else enters the final scroll at this time, it's unlikely that he will encounter them.

Zhao Xu entered the layer upon layer of bookshelves and suddenly felt that each book was subtly trembling. The amplitude was not large, but it showed that the books themselves possessed some kind of vitality.

After touching the item, Zhao Xu was clear that items having intelligence was not an uncommon phenomenon. In his past life, it was just that he didn't have the means to interact with them.

The vibrations emitted by the spellbook after it was returned to the bookshelf caught his attention.

In the past, he had mainly recorded spells based on the spell list projected onto his retinas, directly summoning them without personally selecting the spellbooks. If he really had to search through all the spellbooks by himself, it would take him at least a day to organize them all.

Instantly, Zhao Xu felt a sense of curiosity and reached out to grab the nearest spellbook, "Higher God's Visage" (Ninth-level Cleric Spellbook), in front of him.

After grabbing it, he noticed that the book cover was painted with an abstract angel, but the angel's specific face was obscured.

Suddenly, a powerful and sacred energy emanated from the pages of the spellbook, causing sparks to wildly flutter and dance on his arms.

Zhao Xu saw this scene and couldn't help but release his grip.

Instantly, the "Higher God's Visage" spellbook transformed into wings and slowly fluttered back to its original position on the bookshelf.
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu had no idea what was happening, and then he suddenly discovered that his character panel had additional content for releasing a spell - "Ninth-Level Divine Form: Higher God's Appearance (Effective only within the confines of the final scroll space)".

Looking at this prompt, Zhao Xu adopted a half-believing, half-doubting expression and, without any incantations or gestures, controlled his consciousness to release the spell.

The space around him changed completely, and a powerful divine aura congregated beside him, taking the form of a whirlpool.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu's appearance transformed, similar to when he used to transform into a heavenly servant, and enormous, extraordinary divine power burst forth from his body.

["Adventure Seeker, Summer, you have cast 'Higher God's Appearance' on yourself. You gain +1 Natural Armor, Low-Light Vision, Resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity, and Disease, and Immunity to Poison. You also gain +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +4 Charisma, and your attributes are boosted for 17 rounds (102 seconds)."]

Zhao Xu's dynamic panel then displayed this information, and his character panel also synchronized the data, showing the enhancements provided by the "Higher God's Appearance" ninth-level spell.

The dynamic information displayed on the panel was the actual strength of the "Higher God's Appearance" spell.

It wasn't until 102 seconds had passed that the effects of the ninth-level spell "Higher God's Appearance" began to dissipate, leaving Zhao Xu feeling empty and powerless.

However, Zhao Xu had finally understood that he could obtain power from the spellbook and release the spell by touching the book.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, this also means that he can touch these powerful spells much earlier than others.

Especially after the national crossing, players will also start to learn spells seriously like Arthur the wizard, and this effect will be more obvious.

Zhao Xu is currently only touching one- or two-level spells and has not yet reached the true threshold.

After reaching the second level, many spells require a significant failure rate, and some may fail and need to wait until they level up again to relearn and obtain.

The stronger the spell, the higher the probability of failure in learning.

Zhao Xu copied the second-level spell seamlessly, but it was only made possible by the bonus of the wise wizard.

Once he reaches the third or fourth level, he will start to face difficulties.

Any player with low true intelligence will encounter this predicament when learning second-level spells or third-level spells.

Zhao Xu has a true intelligence of 17, so he couldn't help but get by for now.

However, he didn't expect that in this final volume space, he could actually experience the feeling of casting a spell by touching the spellbook.

But Zhao Xu didn't hesitate for long and directly shouted, "Time Stop Spellbook!"

Suddenly, the legendary spellbook, which was said to be extremely powerful but difficult to master, flew in front of him.

Zhao Xu walked up and directly grasped the spellbook, starting to absorb its power.

Suddenly, the seal on the book's cover emitted a blue eye-like energy, which poured into Zhao Xu's body like a ray of sunshine.

Zhao Xu did not let go of the spellbook until the eye closed, and then he slowly released it, allowing it to fly back on its own.
Zhao Xuyang looked at the library in front of him, picked a gold coin from his backpack and placed it on the tip of his index finger, then flicked it with his thumb. The coin immediately flipped rapidly and flew upwards.

Just as it was about to be suppressed by the gravity created by the final scroll's virtual space and start to fall, Zhao Xuyang suddenly shouted, "Time Freeze."

[Adventurer Zhong Xia enters a state of time freeze, time is frozen for 1D4+1 rounds = 3+1 = 4 rounds (24 seconds), countdown 24 seconds.]

The coin that was about to fall was suspended in mid-air. The air around them also stopped flowing, and various spell books emitting special light were frozen in place, no longer changing. This was the power of the ninth-level spell - Time Freeze.

Zhao Xuyang was no longer the ignorant warrior he once was. He now understood that this spell simply gave him an extra 12-30 seconds of precious time.

During this time, he could not affect the outside world, but he could change himself, because this was his timeline. When high-level mages fought, sometimes the starting move was a time freeze, giving them time to calmly plan their battle strategy and strengthen themselves.

Zhao Xuyang waited silently for the 24 seconds to pass, then heard the crisp sound of the coin hitting the ground. He realized that the ninth-level spell Time Freeze would not be a hindrance to him in the future.

In theory, he should have felt the urge to pick up those third-level spell books and use the energy of the spells to lower the threshold for future learning. But at this moment, Zhao Xuyang felt like a player who had just obtained a cheat code.

"Disintegration Spell!"
"Rainbow Light Magic Sphere!"
"Warning Spell!"
"Invocation Spell!"
A set of nine-level magical scrolls flew towards Zhao Xu's face, allowing him to recharge and then release them. Gradually, Zhao Xu also began to sense how those spells were flowing through his body.
