Chapter 349: Saving People to the End

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, the people surrounding him in the outer circle had already discovered his extraordinary abilities and dared not to make a loud noise. The novice priests standing in the inner circle, all of whom were nodding their heads thoughtfully, were usually fearless individuals who could receive teachings with an open mind, and this was partly due to the rewards from NPCs.

This time, Zhao Xu had demonstrated his techniques in public, combined with the fact that novice priests rarely released restoration spells to strangers. This had allowed everyone to listen to his words.

In reality, Zhao Xu also hoped that these players would not only believe in the goddess but also seize the opportunity to level up.
For players who only believe in the goddess, it was unlikely that they would be as devout as an original priest. At this time, they would need to rely on getting life energy from other sources to promote their leveling.

After Zhao Xu finished his spell, Zheng Xin'an re-examined the middle-aged woman who was still lying on the ground, unconscious.

As expected, the wounds on her arm had already healed after being injected with warm energy, and the original redness had completely disappeared.
"This 'Heat Demon' has been completely cured," Zheng Xin'an exclaimed with joy.

"So quickly?" The other novice priests also pushed forward to take a look and were astonished to find that it was indeed the case.
"Even her other illnesses have been cured?" Another novice priest, Bu Feng, examined her again and was surprised.

As everyone watched this scene, all eyes turned to Zhao Xu.
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xu nodded, "Removing diseases as a three-ring skill is possible to cure all diseases at once, including parasites that can be killed. However, there are some special exceptions, or requirements for the caster's level." 

Zhao Xu knew that the next sentence was unclear to everyone, but that was okay. He liked to speak in a precise manner, and one day everyone would understand. 

Removing all diseases is the reason why this skill can be ranked as a three-ring skill. 

"Wow, if there was a three-ring skill like this on earth, there wouldn't be so many deaths from serious illnesses." 

"Don't be ridiculous, even if there was such a three-ring skill, it's not something ordinary people like us can enjoy. Not even in Aser, a one-hundred-and-fifty-gold coin is required to hire a three-ring mage to cast a spell. And the cost of a scroll is three to four hundred gold coins." A player who had worked at a scroll shop joked.

As soon as he said this, the common people outside the circle began to understand what was going on. This priest had saved a middle-aged woman a huge 150 gold coins by doing this.

Ordinary people would have to donate 150 gold coins to the church to get this kind of treatment.

The gamer didn't have a personal experience like this, but the other common people looked at the middle-aged woman with envious eyes. Who among them didn't have some minor ailments? The other party could say that they had been blessed with good fortune and directly cured.

"That's just restored, isn't it? But what's with that pale complexion?" Priest Bufeng felt a bit strange.

Zheng Xin'an explained, "She may have recovered from the 'attribute damage', but her physical attributes are not recoverable."
At this moment, the novice pastors around him finally realized. Saving the patient on Earth was indeed effective, but the opponent had suffered from bone death caused by the disease before, which would definitely not be within the scope of treatment.

Only thinking about the initial strict orders, no one dared to continue speaking to Zhao Xiu.

After hearing the value of 150 gold coins, they had woken up to the fact that a three-ring pastor might not have many three-ring spells.

In reality, Zhao Xiu had only three three-ring arcane positions, two three-ring divine positions, and five arcana positions and four divine positions.

"So, you should know that when deciding to take action, it's not just about the immediate issue, but also represents the aftermath," Zhao Xiu said as a goddess pastor.

She didn't think it was a trouble, but she also needed to let these players know.

Treating such cases was like finding a stray cat or dog on the road, easy to pick up and bring home, but difficult to take care of the rest of its life.

Especially since the disease's source was obvious to everyone present, including Zheng Xin'an.

"What will happen to the opponent?" a novice pastor named Bu Feng asked Zhao Xiu.

"Based on my estimate, the opponent's body condition is likely to be reduced to three or four points, and the consequences will be easy to fall into a coma, and they will have no resistance to pain in the future," Zhao Xiu summarized.

"It's like acquiring HIV, with all resistance destroyed," Zheng Xin'an directly said, her voice filled with sadness.

The middle-aged woman who was saved would not live long.

"Shall we take her back to the temple?" a female student who had accompanied Zheng Xin'an suggested, proposing an impractical solution.

Facing this situation, although it couldn't be explicitly stated, the other female students still gazed at Zhao Xiu with hopeful eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

As for the disturbance at the temple that day, several people had heard of it, and they knew that this pastor was not ordinary in his teachings. "Don't look at me," said Zhao Xu, waving his hand. "Let's take her back to the temple, it's not far from here. We can go back together." At this time, other novice priests also reacted and hurried over to take the place of Zheng Xin'an, helping the middle-aged woman who was still unconscious.

Zhao Xu thought for a moment and then explained, "I do have a method for the secondary restoration technique, but it won't work in this case." After he obtained the "Super Magic Mastery" ability, he had prepared most of the techniques in the second ring.

"Why is that?" the female students, who knew that Zhao Xu was not someone difficult to get along with, asked curiously.

"The secondary restoration technique can remove the attribute reduction effects caused by magic and restore 1-4 points of temporary attribute damage. However, it cannot recover permanent attribute absorption," Zhao Xu explained, and also briefly taught his students the technique outside the school.

"If you want to recover permanent attribute absorption, you need to use the fourth ring restoration technique or the seventh ring advanced restoration technique," he said.

As soon as he mentioned the fourth ring, everyone knew that the unconscious middle-aged woman was probably doomed.

The person who had coincidentally received the third ring technique from Zhao Xu's good deeds that day, and the temple's fourth ring technique was even harder to obtain, not to mention the attribute absorption itself, which was not an emergency, but the body was weak and unable to resist disease.

"It's no wonder that the 3rd-level warrior on the forum chose to delete his account after being absorbed 6 points of strength attribute. It's because of this reason," Zhao Xu said.

The revival stone itself only represents the "complete restoration" effect and will not restore absorbed attributes.
Here is the translation:

"Is it not like you're feeling a sense of stagnation?" Zhao Xu suddenly asked.

Upon hearing his words, most of the novice pastors nodded slightly, their faces awkward.

At that moment, they all vaguely understood the feeling of powerlessness that Zhao Xu described, and they all secretly vowed to return and practice diligently and sincerely pray to God.

"One of the lecturers, we know that we are not strong enough," a female student responded.

"That's right, and the road to becoming strong has no bounds. Even if we have reached the level of the lecturer, we cannot be satisfied with ourselves, because there will still be four-ring recovery techniques waiting for us to climb," Pastor Bu Feng said, his eyes seeming to ignite a flame of ambition.

Zhao Xu listened, feeling a bit off-kilter, but still nodded.

A moment later, he continued, "Well, let's treat this as a second lesson, and self-organization is also a part of personal strength."

Hearing his words, everyone was taken aback, and Zheng Xin Yin's eyebrows raised in joy, looking at Zhao Xu with delight.

"Later, you can contact the church to arrange 'recovery techniques' for her, and put it under my name."
This sentence made all the novice pastors stunned.

They were completely unable to solve the problem, even if it meant paying a high price of 280 gold coins for the same four-ring magical technique.
It was as if Zhao Xu's words had simply and easily solved the problem.
Even in his eyes, there was no hint of anxiety.

Each pastor in the church has their own share, even if they don't have corresponding divine techniques; they can still ask the church for help.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

This is the reason why the noble families of Misterla are willing to cultivate wizards and clergy. And Zhao Xù has just solved the demon's case half a month ago, which has earned him some credit. He didn't waste the temporary points he accumulated, and he happened to meet this middle-aged woman who was in a coma. It was a coincidence, so he didn't waste his chance.

After that, a group of people arrived at the church, and thanks to Zhao Xù's arrangement, the middle-aged woman even didn't need to wait in line and directly received the "Restoration Technique" spell effect.

Zhao Xù naturally didn't participate in the later activities of gratitude and thanks from others; he did a good deed and quietly found a corner to sit alone, just watching the faithful ones passing by in front of him.

Until later, Zheng Xin'an quietly walked up to his side, filled with reverence, and greeted him with a bow: "Good day, Mr. Zhongxia."

"Ah." Zhao Xù helplessly nodded a greeting.

This is the troublesome trouble, but fortunately, he has already prepared mentally and the target is still useful to him.

"Hey, Mr. Zhongxia, you seem to know my intentions, don't you?" Zheng Xin'an blushed and said.
