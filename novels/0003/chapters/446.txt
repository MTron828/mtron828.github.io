Chapter 447: Secret News of Destruction

Viola, who possessed dark vision, saw the massive and long body of the giant insect, Night Shadow, lying motionless on the ground, and her heart was racing with shock.

As she walked, she felt the incredible power of her guild master, but she never thought that she could output damage and kill a legendary monster face-to-face.

"This is the 'Unlimited Justice Hammer'?" she sighed.

In the past, Viola had seen her guild master use this skill while following him.

However, she never thought that Zhao Xu, who had released this skill, had such immense power.

If Zhao Xu had just released a fireball skill, the power of the fireball would have peaked at level 10, with a range of 10-60 HP (10D6) and a combination with the Twin Star Extreme effect, resulting in a total of 120 HP.

It was only this "Unlimited Justice Hammer" skill, which was linked to the caster's level, with 1-8 HP damage per level, that could achieve such "abnormality".

Zhao Xu had stacked his skill to 27th level, making this skill an essential "必杀技" (必杀技) outside of "寒颤之触" (寒颤之触).

If Anzhi Noya, who had stacked his skill to 70th level or above, used it, the damage would be over a thousand points.

This was completely unimaginable for players who were still using one- or two-ring skills, and even the top-level legendary mages could only imagine a few hundred points of damage.

"Let's go, don't just stand there," Anzhi Noya reminded her.
Zhao Xu smiled and shook his head, saying, "No, I didn't expect that one day I would be able to rely on the Three Rings of Law to achieve such an extraordinary effect. Suddenly, I felt a sense of nostalgia for the gap between mages and warriors, which was much larger than I had initially thought."

Anzhi Noya corrected him directly, saying, "Zhao Xu, if you think that, you're being too naive."

"I know, teacher," Zhao Xu said with a sincere tone, "I can do this, but it's actually something that other mages can't replicate."

"Holding the Unstandard Law Hammer, stacking 27 levels of spellcasting, and having a twin-born extreme specialization without compensation, each of these is something that even the vast majority of mages and priests dare not think about."

"I'm just aware that I'm not qualified to have such abilities," Zhao Xu said, feeling a bit touched.

At this moment, he was like his past self.

If he had such abilities back then, he would have killed the black dragon in an instant, and wouldn't have needed to waste time or accumulate experience to join a dragon-slaying team.

"Hmph."

Anzhi Noya let out a cold laugh, interrupting Zhao Xu's thoughts, "Most of the monsters you've fought in the past are ancient relics that have been left behind. They're just ordinary monsters that haven't evolved or gained any job levels."

"They're just relying on the old challenge evaluation system, so the Night Shadow, a garbage dragon, could claim to be an 18-level challenge."

"True monsters that have survived through the waves of history, especially legendary ones, have evolved beyond your imagination. Today, you're in this ancient tomb, so you've only encountered these primitive monsters."

"So, Anzhi, you've just killed a small monster. You're still very weak."

With that, Zhao Xu's originally sorrowful expression suddenly turned awkward.
Here is the translation of the text:

After a long time, he finally managed to spit out the words, "Teacher, thank you for the reminder."

Unbeknownst to him, Anniya was actually feeling quite delighted and couldn't help but hum a tune.

This puzzled Zhao Xu, and he couldn't help but open his mouth and say, "Teacher, isn't it too happy to beat up students?"

"No, I just feel that the wind and water are circulating, and I haven't had a good grasp of a student for many years. It wasn't until recently that I realized that when my teacher taught me back then, it was so joyful."

Vivian added a timely comment, "My lord, when you taught the little princess, it was also a choice based on individual aptitude, not intentional bullying."

Vivian's joining suddenly shifted the focus back to Anniya, who couldn't help but slowly examine the other person.

Zhao Xu didn't know why, but he had been following Vivian's steady pace, which was quite unremarkable, to say the least, just like a qualified "tool person."

It was only natural that a sorcerer could transform into a saintly warrior, which was inherently full of contradictions. However, Vivian had covered it all up.

It wasn't until Anniya appeared that Vivian started to "get excited."

Zhao Xu looked at the situation and felt something was off, so he quickly changed the topic, saying, "Let's keep going, who knows what will happen next?"

However, after Zhao Xu raised this red flag.

The road ahead became peaceful, despite them carefully monitoring the movements on both sides of the road, and no more monsters appeared.

It was as if the giant night shadow that had just appeared was just their collective illusion.
Here is the translation of the text:

The only road signs with no facial features that occasionally appear on either side of the road, reminding the three people that this is the tomb of an ancient elemental deity.

The vast and empty stone floor is only accompanied by the footsteps of the three people, which seem to harmonize with each other in a silent symphony, as if performing a unique opera for this tomb that has been quiet for so long.

After walking for over half an hour, the three people finally reached a completely different place.

A stone staircase stood before them, with each step almost as tall as a person, rising steadily to the top of the distant and unreachable sky, where a mysterious high platform with a deep purple backdrop was suspended.

Anshinoya's expression finally became serious, saying, "Just fly up to that platform, and there's a path leading to the main tomb."

In an instant, the three people unfolded their flying abilities, controlling their speed and flying side by side along the staircase.

"Actually, it's quite strange," Zhao Xu said, "These deities are all dead, so why would they build such a large tomb for themselves? It's not like they're going to be disturbed by anyone, right?"

"It's like the deity's corpse is drifting in the starry expanse, and it's hard to find because of the vastness of the starry expanse."

Zhao Xu looked at it roughly, and the staircase in front of him was over a thousand steps, which was equivalent to running a three-lap track.

Anshinoya nodded, saying, "You're right, there is some truth to what you're saying. As long as these deities don't want to live again, it's indeed like this."

"Generally, only those who are not tired of living would design such a complex tomb. They probably want to use the tomb as a base, combining it with ancient mysterious rituals to revive themselves."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Shall We Live Again?"

Zhao Xiumin hesitated to bring up this crucial term, his eyes fixed on the nearby Anniya. "Revival magic is just an ordinary five-ring magic to mortals, but it's definitely achievable for gods. They won't publicize it, so you'll never know they've died. It's just like how you won't publicize your past where you were killed by an undead creature in the Temple of the Dead in Anta City."

"When all ordinary revival methods fail, death becomes a fact that's basically settled for gods."

"The graveyard before us is the tomb of the first 'Fire Element' in this multiverse, and it's the true 'Master of Fire Elements.' Even its posthumous will still suppress the stability of the Fire Element plane."

Zhao Xiumin couldn't help but feel sentimental. "I never knew that Morzeelin was the source of the Fire Elements. No wonder the name is mentioned in the key texts, but the details are unclear. All I knew was that it had a significant impact on the Fire Element plane."

"If I hadn't seen the name on the Morlin Stone in the Dark Era, I might not have remembered it today."

"But the name seems to have vanished from history, and even the incantation to summon the Fire Elements doesn't mention the former immortal."

Anniya's tone turned slightly mysterious. "It's actually due to some historical reasons."

"What?" Zhao Xiumin and Vi Vi raised their ears at the same time.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Anshiniya brought up the topic, Zhāo Xù realized that he had no relevant knowledge or skills, not even a few decades' worth. At that moment, Anshiniya seemed to be hesitant to bring it up, pausing for a while before speaking up.

"Because this god is a suicide case," she said.

"Ernest told him that Arthur would definitely destroy the world in the future, and he killed himself to avoid it," she explained.

"He planned to wait until the apocalypse was over and then resurrect himself from the ashes of this world."

Upon hearing this, both Zhāo Xù and Wei Wei's mouths were agape, barely able to close.

This ancient element god, the supreme ruler of all fire elements, was a bit too straightforward, wasn't it?

"The key to the problem is that Ernest initially told Moses that he wasn't sure whether the end of the world would really happen in the future or not."

"This is the most ironic part of everything," she said.
