Chapter 636: Erasing the Mark, Requipping the Long Sword

At the beginning, he was searching for the "Deep Furnace of Hell" and accidentally entered the underground temple of Death God, where he activated the "Artificial Death God" in the coffin room of the priests. Later, after Mistral's "Rose Cross" intervened in the investigation of the temple, the artificial Death God disappeared.

As a result of the artificial Death God, the "Sleeping Ground" where countless undead creatures were stored merged with the "Ground of Punishment" of the Death God, trapping Wang Qingwei and Esveil together, and Zhao Xu also obtained a fragment of the Death God's power. This was the only time he consumed a revival stone.

Zhao Xu had vaguely realized that the artificial Death God had never awakened since the previous life.

Therefore, the vast desert where countless people had died had never seen its shadow.

However, due to various conditions and the addition of a new variable, everything changed this time.

As a priest, he could enhance his divine power by expanding his faith, which was also the reason why the War God had been pushing the Beast Empire to wage war for thousands of years.

Including the magical goddess Sylvia, the priests did not believe in her, but once they lost these priests, the goddess's power would definitely weaken.

Therefore, the vast desert where countless people had died could make Zhao Xu become the Death God.

The fragment of the power was the key to this.

So it could turn this "Artificial Death God" into a true Death God.

In this moment, Zhao Xu finally realized that things were big.
Here is the translation:

The pit he dug may very well bury the innocent civilians of the desolate land to death. Zhao Xu's face changed slightly. After Lark's departure from his body and its fusion with Zheng Xin An, this process was done by Zhao Xu, who browsed through the daily reports to reassure himself about Lark. However, the "Artificial God of Death" suddenly appeared in the desolate land and blocked the door. Although it's unclear whether this is the "God of Death" from the past or the former godly fragment owner, it represents Zheng Xin An as being in an extremely dangerous situation.

"You're pulling me in, with no meaning whatsoever," Zhao Xu said, looking down at the already deserted city below. "Aren't we supposed to face this difficult situation?"

"It's not in this Devil's machine that you think you have a chance to win?" the God of Death said, shaking his head.

"By broadcasting 'death' just now, you've judged this point," Zhao Xu said with a slightly tense expression. "So, you're guessing that I will cause massive killings to decipher this world?"

"Life and death are eternal themes. Witnessing death can easily reveal the loopholes in this world, and your direction is indeed correct."

"Meanwhile, your 'urban positioning technique' is truly beyond my imagination, and I didn't expect Arthur to have a wizard who could replicate such a high-level magical ritual."

"However, I have clearly failed." Zhao Xu also looked a bit regretful.

If he hadn't directly pointed out the other party's identity, he would have had to wander around this dream world, waiting for the other party to feel suitable.
Here is the translation:

"It's very simple, but simulating the entire world's scale is too large. But have you thought about it? You used the 'teleportation' to switch scenes, which in essence left a gap for me to fill. I just need to simulate your destination specifically and it's done."

"Oh, I see."

Zhou Xu suddenly understood.

He thought he had jumped out of the chessboard, but in reality, he was still trapped in the maze of the wizard. Simulating the entire world was indeed too difficult, but simulating the region within his field of vision was within his range.

Looking back, he should have been more cautious and used methods like "swift explosion" or "time stop" to reach the end of the world before his opponent reacted.

"My true intention is to use your dream-induced death to awaken the residual spirit of the Grim Reaper within you and lead you to true immortality."

The Heavenly Realm of Humanity emitted a clear hum.

"Apparently, I still underestimated you."

"Just a moment ago, I might have still had some doubts, but now I am absolutely certain -"

"You have no intention of becoming a true Grim Reaper."

"This makes me curious. Countless people have dreamed of achieving true godhood, even the Grim Reaper, which is one of the strongest divine powers. Yet, it's not your goal?"

Born in the hands of the main god, and having experienced the "Heavenly Realm of Humanity" through the Grim Reaper, it's hard to imagine.

Can someone really give up on achieving godhood?

In the multiverse, regardless of how powerful a being, achieving godhood is undoubtedly the most direct and ultimate path.

"I'm cautious about things that are unclear."

Zhou Xu shook his head and said.

The previous Grim Reaper, Edmond, who was closest to the Grim Reaper, ultimately fell without a clear explanation.
Here is the translation of the given text into English:

The God of Death's divine power was fragmented, and each family held a part of it. Behind the scenes, which puppeteer was not capable of stirring up the existence that could turn Arthur's world upside down?

Therefore, Zhao Xu had always regarded the "God of Death's fragmented power" as a way out, rather than the only way.

Even if the families' chips were unclear, Zhao Xu would still bet everything he had. At this moment, with no end in sight, Zhao Xu naturally had no choice but to make a decision.

Moreover, the concept of the God of Death's death was an ultimate destination that lingered in his mind.

"Now, the only way is for you to stop this artificially created God of Death."

"I won't do that," said the Heavenly Being. "I'll just return to the original world to avoid the virtual death aura from being prematurely triggered."

As the Heavenly Being waved his hand, the timeline of the Earth suddenly reversed, pushing the world back to its original state.

The "Time Reversal Talisman" in Zhao Xu's hand also unleashed a mysterious glow, sweeping across this world and illuminating every corner of the retina.

"Sorry, I'm borrowing the power of your Time Reversal Talisman. Otherwise, it would be much more laborious to reverse this timeline."

In an instant, Zhao Xu saw that the world below him had returned to its original vitality.

The sun that was about to set was as if being pushed back by human hands, returning to the time when it first rose, and then back to the moment when it first began to rise.

"You can control this world, can't you? Then wouldn't we have an absolute advantage in battle?" Zhao Xu was astonished.

"The chessboard has changed, but the pieces are still the original pieces. This is just a dream world's puppet device, not a world of unlimited wishes. Therefore, it cannot be changed. This dream world is out of your control."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if it means making you die, I will only let you kill yourself willingly. This is also a limit set by the Devil King's device, which catches those who fall into the dream and many clever people want to escape from it by directly killing themselves in the 'dream'."

"Unbeknownst to me, this will actually make my physical body think it has really died, leading to actual death."

"Yeah," Zhao Xu nodded.

Since the Heavenly Court has spent so much effort to reverse time, it must mean that a quiet environment is needed next.

"What plan do you have that needs my cooperation?" Zhao Xu asked.

"No."

At this moment, the Heavenly Court emitted a profound voice.

"I want you to remake me anew."

"No," Zhao Xu reacted instantly.

"No, the current me is indeed a 'transcendent weapon' and the Heavenly Court is not lying, but even if Death has disappeared for many centuries, it cannot erase the indelible mark left by Him."

"As the direct inheritor of Death, I will naturally have dominance over you when I meet you. With my just-mentioned power, I can still manipulate these demons. When the artificial Death God gets me, you can imagine how absurd the situation will be."

"Moreover, it will soon possess the countless undead beings in the Wilderness of Death."

Zhao Xu couldn't help but mutter to himself after hearing this.

"This is what I should have done when I brought you out - can I return it now?"

But the Heavenly Court also let out a bitter laugh. "Do you think I'm thinking of that?"

"This time, the massive wave of undead has awakened the artificial Death God and made it realize that I exist in the depths of the Wilderness of Death. Relying on the two crippled and broken old men, it's impossible to continue delaying, so I've come to you in desperation."
Here is the translation:

Zhao Xu suddenly realized this moment.

Indeed, there is no such thing as love without a reason in this world.

The tide of ghostly waves, induced by the artificially created god of death, forced the path to heaven to rise, and all these events are connected like a chain.

As a result, the ghostly waves that burst forth from the bottom and the path to heaven are connected.

"So, don't think I'm very relaxed," he said. "Erasing the mark of the god of death is a kind of destruction to my consciousness, and it's possible that I won't be able to wake up for thousands of years."

"What are you pursuing?" Zhao Xu asked, looking at the other party with a hint of sarcasm. "Are you not seeking something?"

"The pursuit of humans is different from the pursuit of our divine intelligence," the Path to Heaven said calmly. "Even if I fall into the hands of the artificially created god of death, I am still the destiny of a divine weapon."

"But you just unintentionally became the god of death, so I believe you, and only you can sacrifice all the godly auras on my body and give up the possibility of becoming a god from me."

"So I beg of you, when I regain consciousness at that moment, please help me transfer my soul and reincarnate as a ordinary living being. I want to do that, and then I will be a person without any connection to the Path to Heaven, and it will be more worthy of your trust."

"Alright, the deal is settled."

Zhao Xu also made a decisive decision. "Just tell me how to refine you."

Immediately, the Path to Heaven directly transmitted a profound and ancient "hidden information" on the art of refining divine weapons, passed down from ancient divine systems.

"Now you have to think about what kind of appearance I will show in the future," the Path to Heaven asked. "A +5 slashing sword?"

"No," Zhao Xu shook his head, showing his white teeth.
