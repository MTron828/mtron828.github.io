Chapter 637: The Peak Damage Output of the Summer Solstice

What's this?

After hearing Zhao Xu's words, even someone who has seen the peak of human achievement would still feel a sense of bewilderment.

Generally, powerful magical weapons are not just ordinary +5 weapons, right?

At the very least, a weapon should have a +5 enchantment bonus, allowing for a 5-level increase in attack power and an additional 5 points of damage. Then, various additional enchantment effects can be added, and the final total bonus should not exceed 10 levels. Otherwise, it would be considered a legendary weapon.

However, Zhao Xu does not possess the legendary expertise to craft a legendary weapon, making it difficult for him to do so.

"For me, the additional enchantment bonus is more valuable," Zhao Xu said.

However, the more fundamental reason is that Zhao Xu has already mastered the "Higher Magic Weapon" spell, which can grant a +1 weapon enhancement bonus every 4 levels.

Therefore, he can easily turn this long sword into a +5 weapon, effectively breaking through the legendary limit. At that moment, he held in his hand - the "Unyielding Rushing Fury Long Sword".

As for some magical weapons, due to the custom enchantment, they are only named with a specific name, such as the +5 Holy Sword wielded by Saint Warrior Vivian, which also comes with a higher dispel magic. Otherwise, they are usually named with a format like "+Enchantment Bonus + Enchantment Details".

Unyielding: +1 bonus, allowing for free weapon draw and a 2-level increase in attack and 2 points of damage.
Flow: +1 bonus, using the White Crow Flow Step, +3-level attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

Fearless: +1 bonus, causes an additional 100% damage upon charging.

Bombardment: +2 bonus, increases fixed damage by 5 points.

Proficient: +2 bonus, increases the base attack bonus by two-thirds.

Metamorphosis: +2 bonus, allows the user to automatically adjust their weapon to pierce through damage reduction upon hitting an enemy.

Fine Tuning: 5000 GP, allows the user to change the weapon's size from super micro to super large.

Shadow Strike: 5000 GP, allows the user to turn into a shadow once a day, increasing their range and ignoring enemy defense and agility.

The weapon's strength is enhanced by +1, and the bonus from enchantments adds up to +9. The total bonus reaches a non-legendary limit of +10, with a market price of over 200,000 gold coins.

The two 5000-gold items are not included in the count and can be used freely.

The author has previously introduced the enchantments of "Fearless" and "Proficient" in the article on the art of charging.

The "Proficient" enchantment is essentially a special ability for wizards, allowing them to master a weapon without needing to be proficient in it. It also provides a bonus that complements the user's own attack power.

For example, a 10th-level warrior's attack power is 10 levels, while a 10th-level wizard's attack power is only 5 levels. With the bonus, the warrior's attack power can be increased by two-thirds, equivalent to an additional 3 levels.

However, with the ability to use "Divine Magic", the author's base attack power has already reached the standard of a 10th-level warrior, so the "Proficient" enchantment increases his attack power by 7 levels.

The "Metamorphosis" enchantment is also very effective in piercing through various "damage reduction" abilities.

The Heavenly Paradise comments, "Your choices are indeed good, as you have introduced them in your previous article on the art of charging."
Here is the translation:

"But the 'assault' with a value of +2 is not bad for others who specialize in burst attacks, but it's not suitable for you, after all."
"Not suitable?"
Zhao Xu's expression changed slightly in surprise.

Fixed damage isn't something that can follow the exponential growth, is it?

Zhao Xu quickly reacted, "That's right, it's not bad, but it's too low compared to my current damage curve."

What should he change to?

"If I were you, I would suggest replacing the +2 'assault' with a +1 transformation, so you can freely change your long sword into other types of weapons, such as a long gun, just in case."

Zhao Xu nodded slightly after listening, "Then I would have a total value of +9, with +1 value left for selection."

"Double stream, choose another stream," he said.

Zhao Xu also nodded clearly.

In the future, his "Paradise" would be:
+1 Rush/No Fear/White Hawk/Virtuous/Morph/Proficient/ Metamorphosis/Dense/Shadow Sting Sword.

If he really held such a modified "Paradise", his attack strength would reach 49 levels!
5 levels of weapon enhancement, 21 levels of strength, 10 levels of profession, 3 levels of luck (praise), 1 level of unknown (swift acceleration), -2 defect (civil servant), 1 level of performance (Ain Stone), 3 levels of stream (White Hawk Steps), 7 levels of proficiency (enchantment).

Combined with his "Ghost Strike" that ignores enemy armor, it would be as easy as chopping vegetables. Meanwhile, the two-ring spell "Spirits' Possession" allows the warrior to choose a specialization, and Zhao Xu chose "Fierce Attack" without hesitation.
Here is the translation of the text:

A 10-layer basic attack, bringing an additional 20 points of damage, as it reduces the target's defense by 10 layers. With a 39-layer ignore defense attack, the attack's intensity is sufficient to easily penetrate the defense of most living beings.

"Along with my words, what is the damage output curve after a full-force charge?"

The person from the heavens asked.

"How important is it?"

"Very important," the person from the heavens replied. "In your encounter with it, that one round of full-force output may be your only chance."

As the person from the heavens spoke, they emitted an unimaginable tone, "The artificial god of death has a very abnormal power, which is that his life value exceeds your imagination, and he can also trigger the ability to return to death in the second round, allowing his life value to recover to its original state."

"Therefore, unless you kill it in one round, it's like doing nothing."

"What is the minimum output required for one round to be effective?" Zhao Xu asked.

"I recommend retreating if it's less than 3000," the person from the heavens said.

Zhao Xu, who had already felt crushed by countless players, also felt a slight headache.

According to general players, a long sword's damage range is usually 1-6 (1D6), and with 4 points of strength adjustment, it can increase the damage to 1.5 times, or 6 points.

So, a level 1 warrior with 18 strength would actually deal 7-13 points of damage.

As for the damage curve, it's extremely difficult to increase it further.

An 18-strength 10-layer warrior holding an ordinary long sword, without any additional means, would also deal 7-13 points of damage.

Unless it's a magical weapon, a long sword's damage range is generally around 1-6 points, regardless of who wields it.

As for the increase in strength, it's even more difficult.
Here is the translation:

Therefore, warriors rely heavily on "Furious Assault" to eat. The "Sanctified Slash" of the Holy Warrior, which can deal damage based on the user's level, is extremely satisfying to use. Because warriors are a melee class, it's difficult to create a significant gap in damage output. What truly makes a difference is "Attack Power".

A 10th-level warrior ignores the cost and unleashes a Furious Assault, sacrificing 10 levels of attack to increase damage by 20 points. The damage curve of a single hit is 27-33 points. Generally, warriors of the warrior class don't master combo skills until level 6, and even then, they can barely muster a decent amount of damage in a single round.

In contrast, a 10th-level mage casting the "Triple-Fireball" spell deals 10-60 points of damage (10d6) with a bonus from the "Extreme Effect" spell, for a total of 60 points. However, using the "Divine Hammer" from Zhao Xu, which has no damage cap, deals 33-264 points of damage (33d8) with a bonus from the "Twin Blessing" spell, for a total of 528 points of damage.

To meet the requirement of 3000 points of damage output in a single round, it's like trying to move a mountain. Not to mention the considerations of spell resistance, spell immunity, and the like. This is an impossible target to hit.

"Just what will happen when the weapon is formed?" the Heavenly Angel asked once more.

Zhao Xu let out a slight sigh of relief.

The base damage of the weapon is 1d6. With a 1.5x bonus from Strength, 5 points from Leadership, 3 points from Divine Favor, 20 points from Furious Assault, 2 points from Haste, and a 5-point bonus from the weapon itself, the total damage output is significant. And let's not forget the crucial "Bloodthirsty Fury" spell, a level 3 spell that grants the caster half their level in morale bonuses and adds 19 points of damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

So Zhao Xūyī's total damage is 1D6 + 85, which is approximately 88 points of expected damage. Artur's sea monster has a life value of around 130 points, and even with a single stab, he cannot kill it decisively. However, the key issue is that Zhao Xūyī can output all his damage.

With his long sword and attack strength at level 10, he has already mastered the technique of dual strikes. With the additional attack from the speed spell, Zhao Xūyī can deal a total of three strikes.

Each strike, with the "Unwavering" passive, deals 2 times the damage. With the three strikes, the total damage is 6 times. The "Rhino Charge" ability also allows the first strike to deal an additional 1 time the damage.

Therefore, the final damage is 7 times. "One round of all-out output, 7 times, totaling 616 points," Zhao Xūyī said.

This statement sent shockwaves, leaving many warriors speechless. However, with a life value of 3000, it was not worth it.

"So, I'd like to recommend a new spell to you - 'Destruction Protection'!" At this point, the voice of the Heavenly Being trembled for the first time. "This ancient spell has been passed down through the ages, and its price is 38,500 gold coins. It will not increase the strength by +10, but it will allow your weapon to be recharged 7 times."

"Each ability can be activated once per round, and it can reverse a death-saving throw."

"However, its true strength lies in the fact that each time you consume a charge, you can make an additional attack. You can also recharge it with 5,000 gold coins per charge."

At this moment, Zhao Xūyī felt a numb sensation in his back.
Here is the translation:

This indicates that he can consume 7 charges in one round under the effect of rapid firing and acceleration attacks, and additional 7 combos! Even if it's 10 combos, this frequent attack is expected to lead to a critical hit.

It is expected that 2 attacks will crit and deal double damage. Finally, the total damage multiplier is 10 times 2 plus 1 crit plus 1 crit plus 1 crit, which is 23 times the damage.

"That's 2024 damage," Zhao Xu said directly.

But it's not enough!

At this time, his thinking had already expanded and he recalled the original key concept!

Mounting a charge!

His shape-shifting curse ability allows his longsword to transform into a longgun!

The damage of the longgun charge is 2 times!

Summon the "Shadow Steed" as a mount, and attach the "Warrior's Reins" to its face. Activate the "Riding Combat" skill.

Wear the "Cavalry Boots" and activate the "Quick Riding" skill.

After satisfying the two conditions, simulate the "Fierce Charge" potential and increase the longgun charge damage to 3 times!

Combine it with the fearless curse ability, making it 4 times!

Under 10 combos, the longgun is expected to crit once, dealing double damage from the longgun crit and additional crit effect from the Cavalry Boots.

So he can deal 4 times 10 times plus 1 rhino plus 3 crits, which is 44 times the damage output.

This 44 times output damage is enough to turn the initial 5 extra damage into 220 damage.

Of course, his cavalry longgun charge combos are something that can't be underestimated by anyone - even the gods won't be able to forget it.
