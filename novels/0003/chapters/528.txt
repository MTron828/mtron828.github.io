Chapter 529: The Spell of Permeation, a Deadly Risk

"I'm shocked again," King Qingwei sighed. "Who would have thought that Arthur would have a special effect?"

"But it's really frustrating to listen to," she said. "The second sentence of the prophecy actually points to the Earth."

Zhao Xu's expression turned solemn. "When I first heard the news, I thought the prophecy itself might change over time. Now, we're seeing this kind of profound and clear statement."

The two of them exchanged a glance.

This means that "Earth crossing" has become a virtually unstoppable probability in the depths of fate.

"Strange," King Qingwei thought of Zhao Xu's point. "Isn't it said that these prophecies cannot be recorded in words?"

"There's an exception," Zhao Xu smiled.

But King Qingwei couldn't help but laugh. "I guess I really need to add this to my schedule. Let my parents register a 28-day gift account first."

Her originally beautiful face was now tinged with a hint of sorrow. "As for the summer solstice, you said you have a huge storage bag, so put it away. Who knows if the third sentence will involve this mysterious stone slab?"

Only those in the "crowd" involved in the prophecy will be affected by the prophecy's impact.

This stone slab can break through the limitation of "unrecordable words" and is itself a part of the prophecy. Revealing the text is a way for it to "tell" them something.

"So, this passage of cryptic text must still be able to decipher the remaining part of the prophecy," King Qingwei said confidently. "So, don't you have a next step to think about, Zhao Xu?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhao Xū nodded slightly. "Hmm," he said.

Or rather, his brain, which was like a mental program, was also stuck.

This method of breaking through was one that Luxe had encountered before, so she could give an example.

"I guess the method should be consistent, but the subsequent effort will require a lot of polishing," Wang Qingwei sighed.

It was obvious that the mastermind behind the scene, the first ring to break through, was very easy and convenient for them to verify their thinking immediately.

However, if they continued to use the same method to calculate the second ring, it would be ten times more difficult.

It was like the ancient method of calculating pi, where the process became extremely complex and tedious after a few digits, and many people would struggle to make progress, let alone finish it in their lifetime. Only by continuously improving the method could they make progress.

"Don't worry, we've already memorized the pattern, so we can take our time to think about it," Zhao Xū said confidently.

He was convinced that with his current intelligence, as long as he had enough time, he could make progress and eventually reach the third sentence of the seventh prediction.

Besides, he still had a few copper boxes waiting to be cracked, and he wasn't worried about the debt.

Wang Qingwei also nodded, but soon reacted, "This stone stele has been moved in here."

Zhao Xū couldn't help but turn back and look at the temporary wooden house that had been hastily set up.

Outside, the sound of pounding and hammering was still echoing.

After experiencing a murder event on the first day of living in the temporary inn, the two of them had simply moved out.

Adjacent to the temporary residence built by the construction workers, several temporary wooden houses had been added, and workers were now pouring cement on the outermost layer.

It's true that it's a bit unsettling to think about thieves.
Here is the translation of the text:

Especially various architectural drawings and the like are all temporarily stored in this boardroom, and Zhao Xu can't carry them with him.

"I'll set up a 'magic alarm' this time," Zhao Xu thought to himself.

The duration of this spell is two hours per level, and Zhao Xu can easily sustain it for 46 hours, almost two days, combined with the delay skill, which means it will last for four days.

Compared to current players, it's a world of difference.

"Just like that?" Wang Qingwei seemed to sense the "trouble" in Zhao Xu's tone.

"Not just that," he said, gazing at the closet in the room, which was filled with backup documents, including daily progress reports and various plans. Although they're not particularly valuable, once they're leaked, it would be a big deal.

In essence, he would take out the corresponding drawings for the construction progress and then recover the previous ones.

Although this place has a patrol system at night, and he even lives next door.

However, this cannot stop a truly skilled thief, and even Zhao Xu can use his "stealth" skill to sneak in silently.

At this moment, Wang Qingwei also noticed that the closet Zhao Xu had made had two doors.

He first closed the inner door and then took out a handful of jade powder worth over a hundred gold coins from his pocket and sprinkled it on top.

As he muttered incantations, the powder began to emit a sparkling glow.

Suddenly, it began to move and spread evenly across the inner layer of the closet door under the influence of the incantation.

Wang Qingwei also instantly recognized this spell as the "Three-Ring Seal Mark".

"Yes," Zhao Xu nodded in response.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I remember that this spell can seal a door, a cabinet, or a similar enclosed entity to prevent entry or prevent it from being opened. Is it really that magical?"

"No, the door or object protected by this spell can only be broken open, and it's even more difficult. It can either be opened by a switch spell or a spellbreaker."

"What about the consequences of opening it?"

"Except for me, anyone who opens it, regardless of whether it's through magic or physical means, will cause 1-4 levels of damage to targets within a 10-meter radius, capped at level 10. With the amplified effect I just mentioned, it's 80 damage."

"However, if the caster's level is higher than 23, there's a 50% chance that the spell will be locked for 10 minutes using a knockback spell. Of course, this is essentially a magical trap, and if the skill is high enough, it can be dispelled."

"However, this won't hinder the excellent effect of the permanent trap waiting to be triggered."

Wang Congwei also understood, "Here, thieves should have been educated not to enter a wizard's research area without permission."

As she said this, she couldn't help but turn around and glance around, "I don't think there will be any careless kids coming in here to die."

80 points of explosive damage, even if you successfully dodge, it's already full damage and enough to kill most current warrior players.

The lives of more fragile wanderers are even less worth mentioning.

"That's why I asked for this cabinet to have two doors."

As he said this, Zhao Xu took out a sheepskin paper and wrote a short sentence in elegant calligraphy on it.

The gist of it is a warning not to open this door, or you'll regret it, and he's already keeping an eye on this thief.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Zhao Xu wrote this meaningless text, Wang Qingwei didn't seem to be in a hurry at all, and instead appreciated Zhao Xu's continued actions.

For a wizard, as long as they wanted to make this text useful, it would be useful.

Zhao Xu then attached the sheepskin paper to the inner door, and immediately followed it with a mysterious incantation to activate the magical power.

Zhao Xu sprinkled another packet of mysterious powder and placed a scale from a cobra and a mushroom spore on top.

As the spell encountered the powder, a faint blue smoke burst out.

The scale also burned to ashes, transformed into a shape-shifting fish, and became a shapeless snake that hovered above the text, before disappearing.

"What's this?"
"This is the Snake Pattern Seal, a three-ring spell," Zhao Xu explained, and then turned his body to block Wang Qingwei's line of sight, "You can't look at it now, or you'll die."

"If someone reads the text above, the snake pattern will appear and attack the reader. If the target fails to withstand the attack, they will be trapped in a sphere of faint light and be unable to move until released."

"How long?" Wang Qingwei asked curiously.

"Minimum 1-4 days, with each level increasing by one day. So, if someone misfortunes reads the text on the sheepskin paper, he'll be stuck in the amber for a month. However, when they are in a state of suspended animation, they won't need to eat."

Zhao Xu smiled as he explained.

As he spoke, Zhao Xu closed the outer door of the cabinet.

This is also the reason why Zhao Xu needs two-layer cabinet doors.

"Mr. Zhongxia, why didn't you paint on the door?" Wang Qingwei slightly furrowed her brow, realizing for the first time that she couldn't keep up with Zhao Xu's thinking.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if there are thieves who don't care, they might tear the paper down and not even bother to read it when they see it's complicated."

In the end, it's estimated that even bandits wouldn't bother to disassemble it.

"This one, ah, because this spell is a bit expensive, so I'm definitely going to reuse this paper," Zhao Xu continued to explain.

"How much?"

"Just now, I spilled a powder worth 500 gold coins, which is a precious powder,"

"..."

As the next summer solstice arrived, Zhao Xu continued to add spells to this temporary room.

With each new spell being cast, Wang Qingwei's mouth opened wide as she gazed at everything before her.

No one knew that this room would become the most dangerous place in the vicinity of Winter City.
