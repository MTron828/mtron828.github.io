Chapter 109: Floating Disc

As soon as Zhao Xu finished speaking, everyone in the scene gazed at him in a daze, unable to believe the unexpected outcome.

"Actually, it's summer," Maple Leaf hastily wanted to stand up to ease the atmosphere.

However, Zhao Xu had already stood up and shook his head gently: "Each person has their own choices, and they must pay the price for their choices. The road is walked alone, as long as one is clear about the cost ahead, there is no need to force others to agree."

After hearing these words, Maple Leaf swallowed the sentence "It's okay, it's just a reviving stone" in his heart.

Zhao Xu's words were not meant to convince others, but to convince himself.

A while later, Maple Leaf turned around and scanned his three teammates in sequence, understanding a bit from the nods of the others.

"Summer, the four of us plan to stay and accomplish this task, as we initially accepted it," Maple Leaf said. "However, don't worry, we are aware of the cost ahead, and I will do my best to protect my teammates."

As Maple Leaf spoke these words, he felt his heart ease a lot.

Zhao Xu's previous words were also a reminder to Maple Leaf that as long as they could accept the risk and cost, Zhao Xu would not say another word.

He was afraid that it was just a momentary emotional outburst, and then he would turn around and leave without a word.

"That's it, I'll take my leave," Zhao Xu said calmly, having packed most of his belongings into a convenient bag with no need for further packing.

"Huh, Summer Brother, it's raining outside," the priest said lazily.

However, Zhao Xu had already turned and walked away from the tent, facing outside: "There is no spell to make it rain to death in this world."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, Mr. Zhongxia, and here's your compensation," Mr. Luo Ya finally spoke up.

"Let's just go to the wizarding association in the big city and hand it over to Mr. Zhongxia. I'll take care of it," he said.

At this moment, Zhao Xu had already opened the canvas curtain and stepped out, and the sound of his voice carried from outside.

The guards stationed around the perimeter were all seeking shelter from the rain. The caravan had only set up a single tent for the team to use during the day.

When the guards saw Zhao Xu come out, they didn't know he had already decided to leave, and they all nodded to him in a friendly manner.

Zhao Xu's experience of defeating the iron stone had already earned him recognition from everyone.

Even if Luo Ya were to die, Zhao Xu's face would still be able to rally the remnants.

This was the innate pursuit of the Arthurian bloodline, the pursuit of strength.

However, before the summer solstice, the air was already so stifling, and when the rainstorm arrived, it was as if the heavens were pouring down. The rain pounded the ground, creating countless small water bowls, and Zhao Xu suddenly felt the power of nature was unpredictable.

As for the magic that could drive natural power and become one's own power, what level was it at?

Unfortunately, he was not a high-level wizard, otherwise he could have stopped the rain.

Zhao Xu thought to himself as he reached into his backpack and pulled out a rain poncho. The poncho was originally placed in his utility bag by Anzinoja.

Although the poncho had no magical abilities, its outer layer was specially treated for water resistance, and its unique material could be used as a raincoat.

At the same time, Zhao Xu also pulled out a paper umbrella from his backpack. The guards who were watching him were taken aback, unable to believe that Zhao Xu's backpack could hide not only a poncho but also a umbrella.
Here is the translation of the text:

Thanks to Anseniya's help, Zhao Xu was given an umbrella. However, it was useless in this situation, as they were surrounded by muddy terrain that hadn't been cultivated yet, and the heavy rain made it difficult to walk. Even horses could easily sink into the mud. Zhao Xu assessed the situation and thought that even summoning a horse with the first-level spell "Summon Mount" would be of no use.

Just as Zhao Xu was about to leave, he had already come up with a plan. He had copied some useful spells from the scroll given to him by Anseniya. Zhao Xu took out a small bottle of mercury from his pouch and poured a drop of the silver-white liquid onto the ground. He recited an incantation while doing so.

To everyone's surprise, the mercury suddenly transformed into a mist that formed a translucent force field hovering above the ground. The force field, about the size of a plate, floated about a meter above the ground.

Zhao Xu controlled the force field with his mind, causing the concave surface to flatten, preventing any rainwater from accumulating. He stepped onto the force field and, with his mind controlling the movement, the force field began to move forward like a magnetic levitation vehicle.

The guards surrounding them watched in amazement as Zhao Xu, the spellcaster, demonstrated his skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

The "Floating Disc" is a spell originally developed by mages to serve as a makeshift cart to carry objects, with a weight capacity of around 90 pounds per mage level. After the development of the fourth-level spell "Higher Floating Disc", the first-level spell "Floating Disc" was also expanded to allow for the transportation of people.

Zhao Xu, who has now reached the level of a 3rd-level mage, can now use the spell to levitate objects weighing nearly 270 pounds, including himself and a child.

The duration of the spell has also been extended to 3 hours, and it's uncertain whether it can withstand this torrential rain.

Thanks to the levitation, Zhao Xu will not get wet in the rain.

Zhao Xu originally learned this spell in order to gain temporary levitation abilities before acquiring the 3rd-level spell "Flight". After going through a difficult journey through underground tunnels and avoiding deadly traps, Zhao Xu learned this spell.

With a raincoat and a hat, Zhao Xu is now walking along the edge of the South Forest.

As he has broken away from the merchant team, he no longer needs to hide during the day or avoid main roads.

With the proof of the Mage Association in his pocket, he can travel freely wherever he wants.

However, Zhao Xu has chosen not to return to Moon Bay to wait for the association's official arrangements, which would take at least 2-3 days. Instead, he is using the "Floating Disc" spell to travel to the capital city.

Although the spell is slower than riding a horse, Zhao Xu is content with the pace.

As he walks, he begins to scan the surroundings for a place to take shelter from the rain.

However, in the midst of the torrential rain, his field of vision is greatly restricted.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu catches sight of a middle-aged man with golden hair standing in the rain, as if embracing the gift of life.
The text translates to:

The other person's face was filled with comfort, feeling the sensation of the fierce wind hitting their body.

"Need any help?" Zhao Xu whispered.

But at that moment, the middle-aged man with golden hair turned around, looking at Zhao Xu standing on the floating disc, and showed a thoughtful expression, saying, "I should be grateful for your good intentions, but why is there a scent on your body that I dislike?"

"What have you touched?"
