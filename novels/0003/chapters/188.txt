Chapter 189: The Treasure of the Fighting Box

The stone door, incredibly heavy, slowly rose upwards while Zhao Xu placed the sacred seal's indentation in the mechanism and sprang out himself, with Zhao Xu directly catching it with his hand.

As the door swung open, a dismal and unpleasant gas flowed out, but Zhao Xu was tightly grasping the "Eternal Magician's Rod of Fireball" and was prepared to release a spell at any moment.

Finally, the stone door fully rose, with the entire process making no mechanical creaking sound, only a soft humming noise, as if it was being controlled by magic.

Zhao Xu finally realized that in front of him was a banquet hall, with a polished wooden table seating 24 people in the middle, occupying nearly half of the space.

The walls of the hall were adorned with a tapestry four meters long, covered in spider webs, and the tapestry's color had faded to a dull gray, making it difficult to distinguish.

As Zhao Xu searched his religious knowledge and skills while recalling the images of the people on the tapestry.

At this time, the heavy stone door began to slowly descend, finally reaching the ground.

The need to use the sacred seal to open the door meant that this region was the living area of the Death God's priests?

Zhao Xu had already recognized that the tapestry hanging above was the last Death God, Nala.

After the divine battle, this Death God had been in a state of half-fallen, with a history of at least over a thousand years.

Initially, the residual divine power still bestowed upon the priests their divine arts, but it was unable to provide active responses, and the divine nation had also broken apart and decayed.
Here is the translation of the text:

While the priests of the dead god relied on the residual power of their deity to barely cling to life for hundreds of years, they had been trying to revive their spiritual powers. It wasn't until the gods succeeded in piercing through the dead god's defensive power and partitioning his divine authority that these priests lost their final divine abilities and became indistinguishable from ordinary people.

The spirits and their priests have always been intertwined, with their fates tied together. The passing of the last priest of the dead god also marked the official demise of the Church of the Dead God.

It's unimaginable that even the dead god could have a day of death. Zhao Xu had finally begun to realize that the altar that existed was not the devil's altar, but the original altar of the Dead God.

This was a secret hideout of one of the Dead God's followers. It seemed that the devil was just a temporary occupant of the nest.

Zhao Xu walked forward and saw that the dinner table was still set with a gilded candelabra and ceramic plates, although the colors had faded. He could still exchange some coins with the antique dealer. However, Zhao Xu's mind was elsewhere. He walked straight to the cabinet behind the main table and found a layer of white silk spider webs on top. This was not something that an ordinary household spider could create.

Zhao Xu began to open the cabinet one by one. Suddenly, he was startled.

Inside the cabinet, there was a broken and shapeless scroll case, but Zhao Xu had already seen that there was a scroll hidden inside. After all the adventures, Zhao Xu couldn't care about the spider silk and directly took out the scroll to read it.

The scroll hidden in the cabinet was made of high-quality paper and was protected by willow wood strips at both ends.
Here is the translation of the text:

The scroll is usually about the size of an A4 paper, roughly one page long, and records a single spell. However, the scroll in front of me is almost half a meter long, indicating that it contains roughly three spells.

The edges of the scroll show signs of aging, but the center remains bright and new-looking. Under the influence of magical powers, this fragile paper has surprisingly well-preserved itself compared to the surrounding furniture.

[Adventurer Zhong Xia performs "Spell Identification" on the "Mysterious Scroll" and fails.]

Suddenly, the prompt on Zhao Xu's dynamic panel caught his attention and he was taken aback.

With his Spell Identification skill at level 6 and a +3 Intelligence bonus, his identification skill reached a total of 9 levels. Even for a one-level scroll, Zhao Xu had a 5/10 chance of identifying it correctly using his Spell Identification skill. So, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement in his heart.

"This is really treasure!"

Zhao Xu directly used the zero-level spell "Read Magic" to decipher the scroll. This spell allows him to understand the meaning of the scroll.

In an instant, the arcane text on the scroll, which had been processed and transformed, began to take shape in his mind, gradually becoming clear.

"Third-level divine curse!"

"Third-level divine manipulation of corpses!"

"Sixth-level divine wound!"

Zhao Xu suddenly read the details of the three spells on the scroll. They are all core spells, excluding those extremely rare but powerful spells.

The spell to manipulate corpses is a spell to create undead creatures. It is similar to the method used to turn the four people who were killed by an otherworldly evil creature into zombies last night.
Here is the translation of the text:

The curse is a curse that was cast on the character by a trap, reducing his attributes by 6 points. The curse can be slowly recovered over time, but it can only be removed by a spell. If it's not removed, it will permanently affect the character.

For beginners who haven't reached level 3 yet and don't have enough gold to pay for a spellcaster, encountering this spell can lead to account cancellation and a need to restart.

The opposite of the healing spell is the damage spell, which is a counter spell.

The healing spell system is clear, with one ring for treating light wounds, two rings for treating moderate wounds, three rings for treating severe wounds, four rings for treating fatal wounds, and six rings for treating critical wounds.

These healing spells can be freely converted by benevolent priests.

However, the damage spell, which is a six-ring spell, is the opposite of the healing spell. It can deal 10 points of damage to the caster's level, with a maximum of 150 points.

Zhou Xu's scroll is a level 15 spell, which suggests that the opponent may be an eighth-level priest.

It seems that these priests are not very intelligent, as they can freely convert the six-ring spell into the damage spell. Moreover, this spell is not very effective, as it cannot instantly kill someone.

The characteristics of this spell are that it does not kill, but only wounds. Even if it is cast on a 4HP civilian, the opponent will only fall to 1HP, unable to be killed.

However, since the scroll was obtained for free, Zhou Xu happily put it away in his backpack.

This is the first magical item that Zhou Xu has obtained himself. He previously went on an adventure and had Luo Ya calculate the value of the magical item, which was then donated to the local magic association. However, the item was later lost, and Anisya compensated him with an automatic note-taking feather pen.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Zhao Xu is still quite pleased now, with at least 1600 gold coins spent on medical treatment, 375 gold coins for curses, and the controlling corpse scroll worth 625 gold coins, as it contains material costs for magic. It's undeniable that the prices of late-stage scrolls are like a rolling snowball, even if you successfully kill your opponent, you'll still feel a pang in your heart.

Especially when the target is a "specter" or "elemental being" that disappears after being hit, leaving no corpse behind, which is often despised by adventurers.

At this point, Zhao Xu also opens the second chest.

He is clear that this underground temple of the Netherworld is absolutely untouched, otherwise it wouldn't be possible for a scroll worth two to three thousand gold coins to be left carelessly.

This may also mean that all 15 chests in this row have treasures.

Even in the rooms that follow, it's possible that these priests trying to revive the gods are hiding their last fortunes.

This is also the reason why adventurers like to explore underground cities, where there is always the promise of wealth.

Zhao Xu was thinking about his gains today when he suddenly opened the second chest. Suddenly, a giant spider that occupied the entire chest space jumped out and bit Zhao Xu.

Despite Zhao Xu not having seen this familiar face for a long time, he couldn't help but jump in surprise and instinctively performed an evasive action.

However, Zhao Xu's reaction was too slow and he didn't use the "Secondary Quick Release" and teleportation shoes, which made it impossible to dodge.

In an instant, the spider, which was as big as a laptop, opened its sharp fangs and bit Zhao Xu.

However, the "Stellar Cloak" on Zhao Xu's body suddenly flashed like the stars in the night sky, directly exploding with light at the spider's mouth, and sent the spider flying away.
Here is the translation of the text:

The spider was so shocked that it dare not continue fighting and quickly slunk away through the doorway into another tunnel, disappearing from sight.

Zhao Xǔ only shook off the dust from his clothes now, even though the spider's fangs were sharp, it didn't dare bite through his cloak.

Zhao Xǔ was different from the two women, and he didn't hesitate to put on his "magical armor" to come in. It was because the cloak he wore had an immunity effect that allowed him to stand firm against these low-level ordinary animals and insects.

At this moment, Zhao Xǔ also recalled his memories from his past life and recognized the species of the spider.

The super-small variant spider had dark vision and tremor sensing, and its biting attack had venom, which would cause 1 point of strength damage if it was not resisted. Although the opponent was larger than a face basin, its body size of 30-60 cm was defined as super-small in the world of Arthur, and there were even smaller micro-types below.

Zhao Xǔ had encountered a super-giant variant spider in his past life, and he was trapped by the spider's web at the time. However, the super-giant variant spider was then preying on another prey, which allowed Zhao Xǔ to survive.

The super-small variant spider that had just been encountered, with an average of 4 HP, would need to evolve through small, medium, large, super-large, and giant stages before reaching the sixth stage, which was the super-giant variant spider that Zhao Xǔ had seen in his past life. At that time, the body size would exceed 20 meters.

After the shocking experience, Zhao Xǔ let out a sigh and continued to rummage through the remaining boxes. This time, he was more cautious and directly took out a lightweight crossbow and aimed it at the box.

If anything was off, he would pull the trigger again, and if he encountered another variant spider, he would shoot it dead with one arrow.

Until the third box was opened, Zhao Xǔ, who had seen many scenes, finally couldn't help but take a deep breath.
