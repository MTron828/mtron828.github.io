Chapter 46: Treatment Method

Compared to the complex arcane arts of mages, the divine magic of clerics is relatively simple. It's mainly just introducing spells.

Zhao Xu glanced at his spellbook.

【Cleric:
Zero-level spell slot: 3 = 3 (profession)
First-level spell slot: 2 = 1 (profession) + 1 (perception)】

He has three zero-level spell slots and two first-level spell slots, allowing him to choose from 12 + 25 spells. Zhao Xu used up five spells in his battle against Anzhi Noya earlier in the morning.

Some players who have already registered for the "When Will Mages Get Stronger" ID have been posting about how the limited spell slots are unfair. Many players who have worked hard to become mages are now discovering that the difficulty and intensity of the profession do not match.

In other games, mages wouldn't even dare to claim to be mages if they couldn't use at least ten spells in one battle. Zhao Xu, on the other hand, has already used up four or five spells and is already out of magic.

After using up all his spells, Zhao Xu won't be able to cast again until the next day, which has enraged many players who have already graduated or are still in training.

Zhao Xu knows that these players are still stuck in their old mindset, thinking that the game is just about leveling up and killing monsters.

They haven't realized that research, completing tasks, and personal growth can also increase their levels.

In the previous life, it would take at least another month for the concept of conserving spell slots to become a widely accepted norm.

However, Zhao Xu doesn't care about any of this. With his cleric's spell slots, he at least has a minimum of twice the endurance of others at the first level.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Arthur still had some extra spell slots, which was just like his dad. With his experience as a mage, Zhao Xu briefly browsed through the divine magic and basically made his decisions. Since he had no practical needs, he prepared the spells for the sake of it.

In the zero-level spell slot, he prepared the water creation spell, detection magic, and repair spell. In the first-level spell slot, he prepared the blessing and language comprehension spell.

As soon as he finished, it was as if some holy power had directly infused into Zhao Xu's body. He felt a sense of numbness and his spirit became more spirited.

Then, he suddenly regained consciousness. At that moment, he looked at the hourglass on the wall and realized that an hour had passed.

The spells prepared by the mage on that day had turned grayish-white, indicating that they had been used. Zhao Xu, who had just obtained divine magic, did not seem too excited.

As a priest, divine magic and magecraft are similar, with the same components of incantations and gestures. However, unlike mages, priests do not need to understand the principles behind the magic, they can simply mimic the incantations and gestures.

Zhao Xu, with his experience as a mage, did not need training in this regard. He looked at the character card and mimicked the incantations and gestures of the spells he had chosen.

As a beginner might imitate a dance, Zhao Xu awkwardly recited the incantation and made the gesture. Finally, he whispered to himself: "Water creation!"

Zhao Xu's empty hands suddenly burst forth with clear and sweet water. Without a container, the water flowed onto the floor, continuously and unceasingly. It took about half a bucket's worth of water, which soaked the floor of his dormitory.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It's a good thing he lives on the first floor, with the same kind of blue brick floor downstairs, or it would be very difficult to wrap things up.

As Zhao Xu gazed at the water he had conjured up using his magic, he fell into thought.

Compared to the arcane magic of mages, the divine magic of clerics is weaker in terms of control but stronger in terms of support.

At least the most critical healing magic spells are basically unique to clerics.

Zhao Xu is slowly beginning to understand why those who practice magic often look down on others.

Because they have all achieved self-sufficiency.

Mages still need to learn magic, while clerics don't need to ask for anything, just relying on their faith.

What they lack, they can create.

Once they reach a high enough level, Zhao Xu can also create food and houses.

When the apocalypse comes, it will be these practitioners who can find a corner to themselves and live a self-sufficient life.

Zhao Xu sighed at his foolish past self and continued with his plan.

His focus is on healing magic.

Zhao Xu received treatment from a cleric in his past life on the battlefield, and the feeling of his life being elevated is still unforgettable to him.

This is also the significance of the "life value" for these professionals.

Clerics' healing magic can help them restore their life value.

In theory, as long as they won't be killed instantly and have sufficient cleric support, they can team up with a high-defense tank profession to fight against some powerful monsters and achieve the possibility of weak defeating strong.

As the spokesperson for healing, good clerics can automatically convert any prepared spell into a "healing spell".
Evil clerics can convert any prepared spell into a "hurt spell".

Although Zhao Xu is still neutral, he has chosen to specialize in healing.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the list of abilities, there are many harmful spells. Zhao Xu is naturally endowed with the ability to transform spontaneously, and he doesn't need training. However, he now has spells and spontaneous abilities as well. The only thing he lacks is a wounded target. Zhao Xu looked around the entire room, but didn't find any useful tools. After thinking for a moment, he realized that the only target he could use was himself. Zhao Xu lifted his own fist and could only smile awkwardly. Outside, the players who were still adventuring were unaware that the treatment spells they had been crying about every day on the forum were about to be used by someone who just wanted to try.

Zhao Xu took a deep breath and said, "I have to do this. It's not good to find someone else to try it with." He looked at his fist, and punching himself in the chest with his bare fist would cause 1D3 damage to his life value. Since he had 6 points of HP, it was unlikely that he would be knocked out by one punch.

Suddenly, Zhao Xu threw a powerful punch at his chest. This act of giving up defense was so intense that he almost felt like he was going to die, and he couldn't catch his breath. His life value dropped to 4 points.

After a brief pause, Zhao Xu didn't stop. He had experienced the harm of opening up his chest in his past life, and he continued to chant the spell and gestures to heal light wounds.

Suddenly, the first-level spell "Divine Favor" in his mind was consciously attracted to him. The spell energy directly broke through and transformed into the first-level spell "Healing Light".
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as Zhao Xu finished reciting the incantation, a pure white flame burst forth from the palm of his hand, but it didn't emit any heat. Instead, it emitted a sense of comfort and warmth. The priest's healing spells were mostly contact spells, and a simple touch was enough. Zhao Xu stuck the flame to his chest.

His information panel flashed on, displaying the message: "Whether to resist the effect of the spell, harmless (resistance will trigger a will save)"
Zhao Xu ignored it and let it default to accepting the effect.

A soft, soothing light poured into his chest, and the uncomfortable feeling of chest tightness disappeared instantly, just like he had experienced after receiving healing magic.

In an instant, he saw his life value replenish directly.

"...restores 1D8+1=3+1=4 HP."

Zhao Xu sighed inwardly, acknowledging that healing magic was indeed powerful, able to restore 1D8+X HP, where X was the level of the caster. Since he was a level 1 priest, the maximum was 5 points. It meant that as a level 1 priest, he could only restore 2-9 HP. Although it wasn't much, it was enough for most people.

Recently, many players in the forum had complained about not being able to recover health automatically. They would only recover 1 HP after lying in bed all night or 2 HP after lying in bed all day. For a warrior with 12 HP, it would take four or five days to recover fully.

This had severely hindered the efficiency of leveling up and killing monsters.

Zhao Xu was well aware that for an X-level character, resting for a night would restore X HP, and resting for a whole day would restore 2X HP.
Here is the translation of the text:

This natural recovery method is far from enough for players' health points.
This is also the reason why the priest profession has become the hottest profession in recent times.
However, the number of priests who can graduate and level up every day is still very small, not much more than that of mages.
Now, Zhao Xu wants to join an external team, but if he shows his mage identity, he will be ridiculed, but if he shows his priest identity, he will be extremely popular.
Yesterday, he heard from Zhang Qi that several classmates have already decided to cancel their original characters and become priests, even though everyone says that priests don't know how to level up successfully.
After verifying the use of self-healing spell, Zhao Xu didn't care about the remaining spell slots.
He turned back and re-read the descriptions of the 12 zero-level spells and 25 1-level spells.
These spells appeared in his priest-known spells on his character card after he completed them.
Compared to using spells, knowing how to utilize them is also a very important thing.
As Zhao Xu slowly and carefully read, his eyes suddenly stopped.
His gaze fell on the zero-level spell that causes minor damage.
As a priest with a kind and benevolent nature, he cannot spontaneously cast spells that cause harm, but he can still prepare for it.
The zero-level spell slot is worthless to him, and he can prepare a spell that causes minor damage and then use it to verify his own healing.
He doesn't need to take a risk and hit himself to cause damage.
Suddenly, Zhao Xu felt that he could become a mage, and it was as if he had been enlightened by a transcendental light.
