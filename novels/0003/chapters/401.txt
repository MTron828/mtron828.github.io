Chapter 402: Mining Account

"Esteemed guests, this is actually the largest underground market for magical items in the Northern Alliance. Even if you go to the capital city, you may not be able to see so many magical items on display tonight." The guide, Sara Zhi, whispered with a smile.

Zhao Xu's gaze met hers, and his eyes seemed to appreciate the generosity of the guests. For him, this meant a good income tonight.

If the mysterious man dressed as a mage in front of him could buy a magical item worth over 30,000 gold coins tonight, he would be able to level up to the next stage.

As for Sara Zhi's attire, she didn't think much about it in her heart.

Many new players who came to buy magical items would dress up in mage robes or hire a mage-style assistant to try to increase their professionalism and avoid being cheated.

However, a set of mage robes was easy to buy, but it represented identity and the magical abilities that could be released, which not everyone could achieve.

Suddenly, Sara Zhi thought of an open room on the second floor and asked directly: "Sir, if you can provide proof of your mage status, since we have a cooperative relationship with the Northern Alliance Mage Association, we can give you a credit guarantee according to the system's credit rating."
As if worried that Zhao Xu thought he suspected his identity, Sara Zhi quickly added: "If you are a newly updated identity, such as a recently certified mage, we may not be able to synchronize the information in time, just like in Mistral."
Here's the translation of the passage:

"Or, if you have sufficient financial resources and don't need a credit guarantee, it's natural to dismiss such a small proposal."

Salsaz was initially under the impression that the old man was just a random visitor, and that the group of adventurers had simply gathered to buy something. However, as he looked around, he felt a sense of caution creeping in.

The man in front of him was indeed decent, but it was the mysterious woman standing silently in the back who caught his attention. Her demeanor and posture seemed to emanate an air of superiority, as if she were facing an authority figure.

Zhao Xiu initially planned to come here to see if he could find any magical items and then report to the local magic association. However, he had just received a message from May mistress.

This was a key event that would shake the foundation of the seven to eight major powers in the southern part of the Ice Mountain Range. Even if there were people responsible for delivering messages, it would take several days. But now, a rumor could spread at such a speed. It was terrifying to think about the significance of this event.

Since it was like that, Zhao Xiu decided not to hide it anymore. By the next morning, he had already set out towards the location of the fallen object.

At this time, Zhao Xiu directly took out his wizard badge and, in addition to the "Secret Silver Flash" badge, which he had deliberately attached to it.

"That's, please help me check how much my credit limit is," Zhao Xiu said.

In theory, the black market trading of magical items in the Northern Alliance involved an immeasurable amount of "detection magic" and "identification techniques." However, with the "Five-Ring Magic Stabilization Technique," one could perform a permanent three-ring "Secret Law Vision" technique, unless one was a five-ring wizard and had obtained a large amount of gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unless you apply to the Association, you won't know when you can get in line. The "Magic Constant Spell" requires constant consumption of one's "life energy", affecting the speed of promotion. Generally, five-ring wizards who master this spell prepare a few for themselves and rarely cast it for others.

Moreover, you need to be vigilant at all times, worrying that a careless wizard might cast a "dispel magic" spell on you. If that happens, it's blood and tears.

Therefore, the "Northern Alliance Wizard Association Branch" has a certain degree of jurisdiction over the Northern Alliance's major cities, and is absolutely involved in this underground black market.

Some magic items here are even created by wizards using the "manufacturing of wonders" technique. Unfortunately, Zhao Xu wants to go to the "Fallen Star Town" Wizard Association Branch, which is a relatively weak one and cannot influence the black market transactions.

In essence, he is not a local. From birth to learning magic, everything is not within the Northern Alliance, so naturally, there is no common benefit to discuss with him.

More often, people think he's just here to make a quick buck and wait for his term to end before being sent off.

However, when the wizards of the Association and the black market behind-the-scenes forces have sufficient connections, it means that the wizards have the ability to realize their wealth in the "black market".

In short, wizards can make a living here.

The main problem is that Arthur's spellcasting fee is not very terrifying, with a market price of about the level of the caster multiplied by the ring number and multiplied by 10 gold coins.

For a zero-ring wizard, it's half the price of a one-ring spell. A normal one-ring wizard can cast a zero-ring spell for a mere 5 gold coins or 10 gold coins.
Here is the translation of the text:

The 5th-level mage can only cast "Secret Vision" to collect 150 gold coins. However, it's already a stretch to cast it once a day, let alone the main stream demand for "Detection Magic" and "Identification Art" which requires a longer casting time of one hour. The mage's stamina is not sufficient to cast spells all day. Therefore, the opponent's credit limit can only be determined by the limited slots of three-ring spells.

Moreover, the mage's income is a one-time expenditure, and it may not be sustainable for many families. Estimated to be around 5,000 gold coins over two months, it's enough to buy some ordinary magic items. However, Zhao Xuzhi is not considering this option. If he wants to make a big deal, it's not just a matter of a few thousand gold coins.

Therefore, he deliberately added the "Shining Secret Silver" chip, which can be recognized by the monthly town hall of the Moonlight Guild and the city council of the town. The mage's guild, led by the guild master, also recognizes the phrase "May magic be with you, please assist the badge holder with all relevant matters." Zhao Xuzhi estimates that this phrase may bring him a loan of around 30,000 gold coins.

In the end, Zhao Xuzhi still understands the difference between fixed assets and disposable cash flow. The main issue is that he needs to rush to the local mage guild, but it's already closed.
Here is the translation of the text:

The moment it appeared, it was a matter of seconds to get into the mysterious building where the sacred breath was stored. The meaning would be completely different.

After a while, Zha Xiu's face turned red, and he panted heavily as he ran back, almost out of breath.

Zhao Xiu was a bit puzzled. His "Silver Flash" was not supposed to be this exaggerated.

Earlier, the official in Moon Bay had only planned to send him a bag of local specialties, but he shouldn't have such strong transformation abilities.

Zha Xiu's face was stern, but when he looked at Zhao Xiu's face, he forced a flattering expression.

"You, Zhong Xia, are really too unfamiliar with us. During the day, all you need to do is show this badge and chip, and we will naturally arrange a VIP reception for you tonight."

As he spoke, he also cursed himself for having to drive the two of them in a horse-drawn carriage, without intentionally choosing a luxurious carriage specially designed for VIP guests.

"Oh, it seems that my chip is still useful," Zhao Xiu joked to himself.

He naturally knew that he would be treated like a VIP. Even in a small town like Starfall, he was a middle-level official in the Northern Alliance's Mage Association.

However, he didn't want to be disturbed. Or, after getting the five golden treasure boxes, he didn't want to attract the attention of high-level mages.

Now, he had to do it. Wait until dawn, and the news would be transmitted. By the time people arrived at the scene of the crash, he would have already reported to the Mage Association branch in the capital city.
On this stretch of road, how to arrange and operate is also a test of the association for these novice leaders who are just starting out, especially since the position of the current leader of the Star Lake is vacant, and the implications are self-evident.

"Not, not, Zhong Xia Master," the guide Saraizi apologized with a smile.

"You're a newcomer, you don't know that you have a fortune under your name."

"Fortune?"

Zhao Xu's mind flashed with several speculations.

Life's good news is that a bank card is about to be cancelled, and lo and behold, there's a large sum of money inside.

"Yes," Saraizi said respectfully, handing over a sheepskin paper and his badge chip, "Zhong Xia Master, you have a share account in the Star Lake Mineral Association in the Northern Alliance. This sheepskin paper is your account statement."

"Since last month, a certain amount of funds has been deposited, approximately 50,000 gold coins. After two months, the total is 100,000 gold coins."
