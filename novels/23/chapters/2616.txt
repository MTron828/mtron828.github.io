Chapter 2617: Thousand Treasures Grand World

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There was a cave that was temporarily hewn up in a barren and desolate mountain range.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in the cave while the Stately Painting quietly suspended in mid-air before him.

The Stately Painting was his treasure and had a long-standing relationship with him, thus it was easy for him to regain control of the Stately Painting when refining it again.

A large amount of information was channeled into his mind after that.

“So, that’s it!”

Jian Wushuang looked a little surprised. “I was too weak in my past life. Although I possess the Stately Painting, I couldn’t bring out its full potential. What I could do is only some insignificant techniques even if it’s a secret technique within the Stately Painting...”

In the previous life, Jian Wushuang had only performed the Nine Provinces Seal.

That technique was extremely tyrannical.

However, Jian Wushuang quickly realized the Nine Provinces Seal was not the only secret technique available in the Stately Painting. Four secret techniques came along with the Stately Painting!

Among the four secret techniques, the Nine Provinces Seal was the easiest technique to comprehend and perform.

Besides that, Jian Wushuang probably had not completely mastered the Nine Provinces Seal in his previous life as he no longer felt the Nine Provinces Seal being as difficult as he had thought in his past life.

In his past life, he only knew the Nine Provinces Seal represented the Nine Provinces in heaven and earth consisting of nine styles with one being more powerful than the other.

However, the Nine Provinces Seal’s essence laid in the styles being superimposed and fused!

The first three styles were fused to achieve the Divine Emperor Seal!

The next three styles were to make the True Emperor Seal!

The last three styles on the other hand would achieve the most powerful Supreme Seal!

The Divine Emperor Seal, True Emperor Seal, and Supreme Seal were the three most terrifying hidden styles of the Nine Provinces Seal.

It was a pity that he could not even fully display the last three styles of the Nine Provinces Seal in his previous life let alone fusing and superimposing them.

He had never come in contact with the Divine Emperor Seal, True Emperor Seal, or Supreme Seal.

He was finally qualified to come in contact with them in his current life.

Jian Wushuang secretly said, “I can easily execute all nine styles in the Nine Provinces Seal with my current strength. It shouldn’t be difficult for me to display the Divine Emperor Seal, True Emperor Seal, and Supreme Seal, but it’ll take me some time to study them.”

In addition to the Nine Province Seal, there was another secret technique he could display among the four secret techniques.

The Thousand Treasures Grand World secret technique!

The Thousand Treasures Grand World—World Transformation.

That was a technique that forcibly transformed the world into one more suitable for battle.

There were many different worlds in the Thousand Treasures Grand World. The Life and Death World; Yin and Yang World; and Water and Fire World. In addition, there were also conducive battle worlds for Jian Wushuang—Space-time World, Transmigration World, and Sword Principle World. Even though mastering that technique might not improve his overall strength by much, it was enough to make a change in his battle strategies.

“The Nine Provinces Seal and Thousand Treasures Grand World are just two secret techniques in Stately Painting which I can study and perform now. The remaining two secret techniques in the Stately Painting aren’t something I’m capable of doing now,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He knew the Stately Painting was so precious and extremely difficult to obtain one in the entire Ancient God Domain, hence the secret techniques which came with it were not something easily executed.

It would be extremely helpful to him nonetheless if he was able to master the Nine Provinces Seal and Thousand Treasures Grand World.

“Let’s begin studying then.”

Jian Wushuang anticipatingly began studying the three superimposed seals of the Nine Provinces Seal as well as the Thousand Treasures Grand World.

Three years passed by in a flash.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes slowly opened up inside that cave.

“The three fusion seals within the Nine Provinces Seal are much more difficult than I thought. I’ve been studying for three years, yet I’ve just barely fused the first three styles of the Nine Provinces Seal. I can fundamentally display the Divine Emperor Seal but not to its full potential. I’m afraid it’ll take me a long time to study the remaining True Emperor Seal and the Supreme Seal.”

“The Thousand Treasures Grand World is much easier for me to comprehend on the contrary and I’ve already got most of it under my control.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly before immediately standing up. “Let’s go outside and try it.”

Jian Wushuang then walked out of the cave and came to the vast void.

He took a deep breath and waved his hand as a ray of light instantly melted into the surrounding void followed by the world being transformed.

A wonderful scroll painting world appeared out of thin air above the infinite sky.

Jian Wushuang saw the scroll painting world and grinned.

Under his subconscious control soon...

“Thousand Treasures Grand World—Transmigration World!”

Rumbling...

His surroundings instantly began to transform.

It was originally a barren mountain range but had become complete darkness in the blink of an eye. Huge Reincarnation Passages appeared out of thin air one after another inside this darkness. The Reincarnation Passages were scattered in every corner of the world as the endless Transmigration Strength spread.

That was a Transmigration World filled with endless Transmigration Strength with Jian Wushuang standing at the core of the Transmigration World as the world’s master!

“So, this the Thousand Treasures Grand World” Jian Wushuang was pleased upon seeing the changes in the surrounding world into the Transmigration World before him.

The Transmigration World conjured from the Thousand Treasures Grand World was completely different from a Principle World.

The Principle World was discharged from one’s own body to oppress and frighten the opponent. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

On the other hand, the Transmigration World conjured from the Thousand Treasures Grand World was to transform the world and its surrounding environment into a state most conducive for the user to fight.

The Transmigration World would be perfect for Jian Wushuang to manipulate the Transmigration Law to its fullest and even exert a combat power far exceeding his own since he had comprehended Transmigration Law. Such was the so-called environmental advantage!

Various geographical factor advantages could determine the victor between two almost equal in combat strength opponents.

Thousand Treasures Grand World was able to place its user at an absolute geographical advantage!

Moreover, the world conjured from Thousand Treasures Grand World was mysterious for being able to create various changes in attacks.

However, Jian Wushuang had only gained preliminary control and could not perfectly use the Thousand Treasures Grand World. In the future, he could try using it to create a world with both Space-time and Transmigration as his control over the Thousand Treasures Grand World becomes stronger. Perhaps, one day he could also add-in the Sword World.

There was no doubt that the Thousand Treasures Grand World would be more helpful to him in the future when compared to the Nine Provinces Seal.
