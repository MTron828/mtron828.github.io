Chapter 2094 The Black Dragon Clan

The Black Dragon Clan became one of the top Four Clans with their formidable abilities and presence of Great Emperors. Normally, it would be hard to shake such a clan.

But Jian Wushuang knew how the Archelon Palace operated.

The Archelon Palace had infiltrated other clans for ages, their influence was unimaginable.

The Vientiane Tower at the human domain? Built by the Archelon Palace from the bottom up.

They were even able to nurture a Great Emperor, placing him within the highest ranks of the Sanctuary Alliance.

Within the Special Tribes domain, the Archelon Palace should have laid their own groundwork a long time ago too. If they had truly begun, the top Four Clans would have been affected to a certain degree.

The Sky Swallowing Clan had most likely defected towards the Archelon Palace however, so it was normal for nothing to have happened amongst themselves.

The Ancient God Clan was too powerful, with four Great Emperors alone, along with the pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor Jian Wushuang was the head. Even if they had infiltrated the clan to a certain degree, it could not possibly affect things much.

But when it came to the Black Dragon Clan and the God Eater Clan, the Archelon Palace were definitely able to disturb them.

Only the Black Dragon Clan was not affected by everything going around. It was too quiet.

This level of quiet was disturbing enough for Jian Wushuang to check it out.

“We are heading for the Black Dragon Sanctuary. Keep this a secret,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Understood,” King Chen Xing nodded.

After which, experts led by Jian Wushuang and King Chen Xing headed towards the Black Dragon Sanctuary via wormhole.

Stepping into the Sanctuary, they immediately headed towards the Black Dragon Clan.

At the same moment, at a Void above the Black Dragon Clan lair, massive amounts of people congregated in that one single spot, and floated.

They all emitted impressive auras, the weakest of which was already at Sir God level. At a glance, there were more than two hundred people there.

Within these two hundred-odd experts, Black Dragon experts made up seven-tenths of it. The remainder of them were black-robed Archelon Palace experts.

In front of the pack stood the Black Dragon Clan leader Ba Su and a black-robed eerie elder from the Archelon Palace.

“News from within the Ancient God Clan. King Zhan Cang has brought several experts to assist the other tribes,” the black-robed elder spoke.

“Just Zhan Cang? Where’s King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu, and that Jian Wushuang?” Ba Su frowned.

“I don’t know,” the elder shook his head. “The Ancient God Clan is different from others – they worship bloodline over anything else, not even ability. They have absolute loyalty for their emperor. This makes it difficult for Archelon Palace to infiltrate. All this time, we still were not able to get into their top ranks. It’s impossible to know where they have gone.”

“But if my predictions are correct, that Ancient Emperor should still be at the Ancient God Clan.”

“Hngh, stay there for all he wants!” Ba Su gave a sneering laugh. “He thought getting someone to spy on me would be enough? They underestimated us!”

Sky Swallowing Clan, as one of the top Clans around, naturally had their own tactics.

They knew the Ancient God Clan had been spying on them all this time, yet they were still able to avoid surveillance.

Like right now, almost nine-tenths of Sky Swallowing experts were there, but the spy from the Ancient God Clan had no idea.

“It’s time, let’s make our move,” Ba Su said.

“Yep,” the black-robed elder nodded, and waved his hand.

Immediately, four black-robed figures went off in all four directions, but all were heading towards the Void near the Black Dragon Clan’s lair.

Once they were in position, they each took out a transmission token.

As they crushed the token, a Formation that had already been prepared within the token immediately took over.

It covered everything around, including the lair and the Void.

“This Formation was specially made by us Archelon Palace. Not only does it lock spacetime, it is also indestructible! Great Emperors won’t be able to lay a single scratch on it. With this, the Black Dragon Clan will never escape!” the elder said.

“Haha, wonderful,” Ba Su was elated. With a wave of his hand, he said, “Let’s go guys, to the Black Dragon Clan!”

As Ba Su moved, the bloodthirsty, elated experts of the Sky Swallowing Clan followed.

…

Within Black Dragon Clan’s dark hall.

A beautiful woman in black, the Black Dragon Emperor, sat on her throne, looking down on the many Black Dragon experts.

“Much has happened since the formation of the Special Tribes Alliance. Obviously there is something going on behind all this, and it also shows the Archelon Palace planned this a long time ago. Their goal now is to prevent the Alliance from joining the battle.”

“According to the Ancient God Clan, clans and tribes of all abilities were affected, even the Top Clan God Eater Clan. We of the Black Dragon Clan must be cautious at times like this!”

“Pass the order down, the Protective Array will be activated to its maximum. In the meantime, any clansmen caught provoking one another, or causing chaos and panic, will all be cut down.”

The Black Dragon Emperor’s voice sent shivers down spines.

“Understood,” the experts all heeded.

They all knew these were special times, and the Black Dragon Clan could not afford to be careless.

But just at this moment, something happened!

Hong!

A loud roar resonated.

It was like thunder, with a second roar chasing behind. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The entire Black Dragon Clan was taken aback.

“What’s happening?”

Everyone in the hall, along with the Black Dragon Emperor, was stunned.

“This sound, someone’s attacking our Protective Array!” The Emperor’s eyes turned cold.

“Move!”

Immediately, the experts all left.
