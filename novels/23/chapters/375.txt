Chapter 376: The Fallen Genius

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the air above the yard, many members of the Lin family were watching and gasping as Lin Lan fell to the Profound Yin Void Realm from the Initial Yang Void Realm.

“Sure enough, Miss Lan’er is weaker than before. Even worse, she fell back three levels this time.”

“Tsk-tsk, she might be the only in the whole Divine Land who becomes much weaker because of a breakthrough.”

“Who would have thought that the most peerless genius of the Lin family to appear in a hundred years would fall into such a miserable situation in only short two years?”

“I heard that Master has decided to marry her to Luo Hai, the Great Elder’s son.”

“Luo Hai? That notorious playboy?”

The same discussion about the girl could be heard from every direction.

Standing in the air, Jian Wushuang and Lei Yun didn’t miss any single word of those undisguised comments.

Lei Yun looked grave and quivered. He seemed to be controlling his anger.

As for Jian Wushuang, he wore an odd expression while listening to the comments.

In the yard, Lin Lan’s breath slowly settled down. However, she was trembling, her face twisted, and her eyes said that she wouldn’t take her defeat lying down.

She wanted to howl and lash out, but she finally suppressed the desire.

Gnashing her teeth, she headed to her room with her head down.

“Let’s go back too.”

The people up in the air sighed and left.

Soon, only Jian Wushuang and Lei Yun still remained.

“Lei Yun, what’s wrong with your Miss?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

He had never heard of someone falling back three levels after an unsuccessful breakthrough.

Lei Yun showed a complex expression and sighed after a long while. “It’s a long story.”

“I’m not in a hurry. Let’s get down first,” Jian Wushuang said. He was really curious about it.

After they returned to Jian Wushuang’s yard and took seats by a stone table, face to face, Lei Yun started to tell the story.

“Mr.Swordsman, you might not know, but Miss Lan’er was the number one genius in our family two years ago.”

“The number one genius?” Jian Wushuang was dazed.

“How could the number one genius end up like this?”

“Miss Lan’er was extremely gifted. She started cultivating at six and condensed her Primordial Gold Core at 10. At 14, she reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm,” Lei Yun continued.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang was even more dazed.

“She started cultivating at six, condensed her Primordial Gold Core at 10, and reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm at 14?”

“Is she really a human?”

In a small empire of the Nanyang Continent, condensing a Primordial Gold Core at 20 made someone an absolute genius. Reaching the Yin-Yang Void Realm by 30 was considered an achievement that only top geniuses were capable of.

Like Jian Wushuang himself, he was recognized as a top genius, but even he condensed his Primordial Gold Core at 17.

In respect to this, he could not hold a candle to Lin Lan.

Condensing a Primordial Gold Core at 10 was an impossible thing in the Nanyang Continent.

“Richly endowed by nature, the Divine Land provides much better resources to warriors than the Nanyang Continent, where kids start cultivating at 12. However, in the Divine Land, they start cultivating at a much younger age, some even as early as 6.”?Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

The difference between the two lands was like heaven and earth.

“After reaching the Yin-Yang Void Realm at 14, Miss Lan’er continued making progress at an amazing speed. When she was 18, she reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm and was only a step away from the Saint Realm,” Lei Yun added.

“At that time, she was the most talented person in our family, as well as the whole Iron Saber Territory. She was respected by everyone and was an example to the youngsters.

“But everything changed when she was 18.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“That year, she suffered an attack from a black-robed man in the Saint Realm while she was outside tempering herself. The man was stronger, so she was no match for him. He caught her, but not to kill her. Instead, he poisoned her with some kind of Witch Poison.”

“Witch Poison?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

“Yes, a very special kind of Witch Poison. It took root in her body and only attacks when she tries to break through a bottleneck. As a result, she always fails to break through and her cultivation even regresses.” Lei Yun’s voice became low.

“It has been two years since she was poisoned. During this period of time, she has tried to break through three times.

“In her first attempt, she tried to reach the Saint Realm from the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, But she failed and fell back one level, to the Exceptional Yang Void Realm.

“In the second attempt, one year ago, she struggled to return to the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, but still failed. That time, she fell behind two levels, back to the Initial Yang Void Realm.

“Today, she made her third attempt. But just as you saw, she fell back three levels.

“During these two years, falling from the Peak of the Yang Void Realm to the Profound Yin Void Realm, Miss Lan’er has experienced falling from the highest point in her life to the lowest.”

Hearing those words, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but be moved.

“How could the number one genius of the Lin family became what she is now just because of a Witch Poison?”

“Can’t she get rid of that poison?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s quite difficult.”

Lei Yun shook his head and continued, “After she was initially poisoned, she was still a peerless genius in our family and was highly favored. We asked several experts and alchemists for help, at a high cost, in an attempt to clear the poison from her body. But it didn’t work out.

“We even managed to have her treated by an expert at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. But there was still nothing the expert could do.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“In fact, if Miss Lan’er hadn’t tried to make a breakthrough, the poison wouldn’t have been activated. In such a case, though she might not enhance her strength, she could avoid a regressing. Alas, she was too stubborn.” Lei Yun let out a sigh.

“She was not reconciled to be stuck at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!”

“Therefore, although she knew that her cultivation might regress if she tried to break through, she never gave up trying. She took every chance she had during the past two years, and she tried three times. Even now, she is still persistent.”
