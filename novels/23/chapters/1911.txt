Chapter 1912: Jian Yi Took Action

“Jian Yi, go!”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the surrounding crowd was suspicious.

Who was Jian Yi?

“Could Lineage of Star have more hidden experts?” The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church muttered.

“But then, there was a sudden change which happened in the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

There was an evil-looking Taoist-robed elder who appeared behind the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

The way he appeared was too fantastical. Although the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church was a Peak Emperor God, he didn’t notice any difference.

The Taoist-robed elderly extended his palm. His palm contained unique magic power and moved closer to the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s head and he was terrified.

“Sh*t!”

The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s face changed and he struggled to withstand it. However, the palm moved too quickly and too mysteriously.

Bang!

The palm hit the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church’s head directly.

A terrifying power spread.

The armor on the surface of the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church was also at the Chaotic Divine Treasure level. It diminished the power of the palm by half at the first instant.

The remaining power took effect and shook the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s body. It was as though his head was going to explode.

Merely with this palm only, he still barely withstood it.

However, just as the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church intended to run away, there was suddenly a large cloud of crimson fog that swept out from the Taoist-robed elder. The cloud of crimson fog was like an exotic beast that opened its mouth. Without giving the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church any time to respond, it engulfed the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

The crimson fog spread and no one could see the scenery within the crimson fog.

Even Soul Power couldn’t probe through it.

In a short instance, in the blink of an eye, the exotic beast that was transformed from crimson fog that had filled the air already dispersed.

The energy retreated gradually and revealed the scenery within.

The scene made everyone opened their eyes wide.

Previously, they had seen the sudden appearance of a Taoist-robed elder standing in the void while there was a cold dead body floating in silence next to him.

The dead body was the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church.

The Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church was a Peak Emperor God. In a short while, he had been killed on the spot!

“How is it possible?”

“This, this…”

“He was a Peak Emperor God!”

The people who saw the scene were in disbelief.

Especially Palace Master Wu Luo and Number One Divine King.

The two of them were Peak Emperor Gods as well. Their power wasn’t much different to a Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s but merely his defense power was slightly stronger.

As a Peak Emperor God, even if his defense power was weak, he wasn’t one who could be killed by just anyone. Plus, he had been killed easily without any power to counterattack.

Just how strong was the Taoist-robed elder that had suddenly appeared?

Just as everyone was shocked and astonished.

Swoosh!

The Taoist-robed elder moved his body and appeared behind Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he revealed reverence and passion in his eyes.

“Master,” the Taoist-robed elder spoke and he didn’t lower his voice. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone at the scene heard the way he addressed Jian Wushuang.

“Master?”

“The Taoish-robed elder who killed the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church with thunderous measure referred to Jian Wushuang as Master?”

“Such a terrifying expert is willing to recognize Jian Wushuang as his master?”

Everyone was shocked.

But Palace Master Wu Luo quickly shook his head, “It’s impossible. Although Jian Wushuang is talented and he has high potential, his power has yet to reach that level after all. The Taoist-robed elder is a terrifying existence that could kill the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church easily. He definitely wouldn’t be willing to take him as his master. From my viewpoint, there’s an eighty percent chance that Jian Wushuang controlled him using a special technique, and it is through soul control!”

“Soul control?”

Once the term was brought up, everyone at the scene quivered in fear.

That was definitely a vicious method.

Jian Wushuang could soul control such an expert. It fully showed that he was a capable person.

Everyone at the scene was shocked when they saw Jian Yi, while Jian Wushuang felt satisfied and secure.

Jian Yi, his servant, was definitely loyal to him. And in terms of power… He was from ancient times.

His fighting power at his peak had reached the extreme limit of Chaotic Realm, which was equal to the Great Emperor in Eternal Chaotic World and the top of the Great Emperor.

Such an expert, although he had only recovered to the top of middle stage Chaotic Realm, his fighting power was still unusually strong.

Jian Wushuang knew that Jian Yi’s fighting power was extremely strong, at least much stronger than his.

Hence, he had been making Jian Yi in Lineage of Star constantly recover his power but never let Jian Yi fight.

His goal was to let Jian Yi suddenly take action during a war like this. to bring about severe damage.

In actual fact, Jian Wushuang was rather happy with the results.

The Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, a Peak Emperor God, also the strongest fighting power from Star Extermination Alliance.

However, just as Jian Yi did a surprise attack. He didn’t manage to put any skills to play and was killed instantly.

“At first, I thought, even if Jian Yi were to take action in silence, he would at most injure a Peak Emperor God and make him lose fighting power, which would be sufficient for me. Who knew Jian Yi could kill the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church directly? An expert from ancient times is really impressive,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church had Chaotic Divine Treasure level armor. Although his personal defense power was the weakest among the Peak Emperor Gods at the scene, it was also extremely difficult to kill him.

However, when Jian Yi took action, he did it with ease.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, this is the opponent I found for you. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as he looked at Emperor God Tian Ling before him.

Emperor God Tian Ling already stopped his footsteps. He was still holding onto his spear but his eyes locked upon Jian Yi.

From Jian Yi’s action, he could tell that Jian Yi was extremely strong and definitely not any weaker than him.

After all, even if he took action, he might not be able to kill the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church so quickly.

“Jian Wushuang, I belittled you. I wonder where you found such an expert and how you soul controlled him,” Emperor God Tian Ling roared coldly.

“Emperor God Tian Ling shouldn’t be worried about where I found him or how I soul controlled him. As long as you know that he is your opponent, that will do,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and looked to Jian Yi, “I shall pass you Emperor God Tian Ling.”

“Yes,” Jian Yi nodded politely. Then, he took a stride and appeared before Emperor God Tian Ling.

Vroom!!!

There was a fierce aura that soared from Jian Yi’s body. The strength of the aura wasn’t any weaker than Emperor God Tian Ling but slightly stronger.

Jian Yi appeared and Emperor God Tian Ling felt a strong pressure.
