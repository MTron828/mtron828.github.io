Chapter 1046: Asura Lord

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, if you dare touch even a strand of hair on his head while I’m around, I’ll pluck out all the fur on your bat body!”

Su Rou’s every word rang loudly inside Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s ears.

His expression immediately darkened.

“Are you from the Blood Asura Clan?”

He swept his gaze through the experts behind Su Rou before finally settling on her. “If I’m not mistaken, you’re Asura Lord of the Asuras of the Blood Asura Clan, aren’t you?”

“Holy Emperor of the Asuras?” Jian Wushuang looked at Su Rou in surprise.

He had read the information on the four great clans and had some knowledge of the Blood Asura Clan.

He knew Asura Lord held the highest position in the Blood Asura Clan. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The position typically belonged to the clansman with the densest awakened bloodline. It was a position that was basically equivalent to the Emperor of the entire clan.

It was similar to the position of Imperial God in the Ancient God Clan.

Jian Wushuang was amazed. “In just a short 2,000 years, Fourth Sister has become Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan?”

“Your clan might be strong but I’m not an easy opponent either. Asura Lord, have you really resolved to provoke me just for this brat?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory snorted.

Considering his disregard for the law and morality, as well as his arrogant character, he would not have bothered talking were it not for his misgivings about his new opponent.

Obviously he was apprehensive about Su Rou, or more accurately, her clan.

After all, her clan was one of the four great clans. He had no choice but to feel reservations about fighting them.

“I’ve made myself very clear. I won’t allow anyone to touch even a strand of his hair as long as I’m around.” Su Rou’s voice was as cold as ever. She waved her fair hand as she started speaking, prompting the experts behind her to move forward. In a split second, they gathered around the apathetic man to form a blockade around Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

The dozens of Peak of Rank Three experts, coupled with a Celestial Master expert, formed a fearsome battle formation that was strong enough to stop Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

More importantly, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory noticed that all the experts were expressionless as if they felt no emotion, so much so that they resembled Puppet Fighters.

“I heard that as a rising star within the Blood Asura Clan, Asura Lord has the densest bloodline in the clan’s history. Moreover, she has awakened the Eye of Asura that allows her to control many experts and have them vow their loyalty to her. Even a careless Holy Master expert might find himself under her control.”

“These experts are probably under her control,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory muttered in a gloomy voice.

Those under the control of the Eye of Asura would be so obedient and loyal to their master that they would not hesitate if they were ordered to die.

Someone like Asura Lord was much more terrifying than the human warriors or Puppet Fighters.

That was why the experts of the Samsara Continent would be so afraid of her.

“It’d be more difficult to kill the brat with Asura Lord around.” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory narrowed his eyes and then took out a token. “Holy Master Dong Ming!”

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, I sensed that Jiu Jian has stopped moving. Have you already killed Jian Wushuang and saved him?” Celestial Master Dong Ming asked.

“Not yet. I’ve encountered some trouble. Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan has personally come to protect Jian Wushuang,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory replied in a gloomy voice.

“Holy Emperor of the Asuras?” Dong Ming snorted. “So the Blood Asura Clan has gotten involved as well! Could they be behind this operation that targeted Jiu Jian? Humph! That damned Blood Asura Clan! Stay there and stall for time. I’ll be there as soon as possible.”

“Alright.” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory nodded.

He once again looked at Su Rou after the brief exchange of message.

“Looks like your clan is determined to interfere in this,” he said coldly. “I might not be able to to do anything to that brat with you around but Holy Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan will be here soon. I’d like to see how you and your men take both of us on!”

Su Rou’s expression changed subtly.

She was strong enough to fight the entire Ancient Demon Clan or a Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, all while ensuring Jian Wushuang’s safety.

However, if Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan were to team up, not even she would have the absolute confidence to protect Jian Wushuang.

In terms of overall strength, the Ancient Demon Clan was not weaker than her clan. In fact, they might even be slightly stronger.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was famous for his overwhelming battle strength powerful and ferocious temper.

The Blood Asura Clan could not underestimate any of them, but if they were to work together, they would certainly be more powerful than the Blood Asura Clan.

“Well, you still have to wait for Celestial Master Dong Ming to arrive before you can see that scene, don’t you?” Su Rou snorted. Her figure abruptly turned illusory, and in the next second, she was already standing next to Jian Wushuang.

“Third Brother,” Su Rou greeted, joy evident in her voice.

“You’re really amazing, Fourth Sister. It’s only been 2,000 years since we last met but you’ve become Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan.” Jian Wushuang was also wearing an expression of surprise and delight.

He had already met his two other brothers, Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan, in the Void Continent.

Su Rou spent the longest time apart from them, which was why she was also the one whom he missed and worried about the most.

Naturally, he was pleasantly surprised to finally see her again.

“It’s because of my bloodline,” Su Rou said with a laugh. Her expression soon turned somber as she continued, “Let’s put that aside for now. The experts of the Ancient Demon Clan will be here soon. With my ability, there’s no way I can handle them and Patriarch of Empyrean Glory at the same time. You should run before the experts arrive. I’ll help you hold Patriarch of Empyrean Glory up.”

“Run? There is no need.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Why?” Su Rou was confused.

“There’s a secret pattern on my hostage, Dao Master Jiu Jian, that allows the Ancient Demon Clan to trace my whereabouts. There’s nowhere I can flee as long as that secret pattern exists. It’s better if I stay here and negotiate with them,” Jian Wushuang replied helplessly.

“But what if…” Su Rou frowned.

“Don’t worry. Since I dare to capture Jiu Jian, I naturally have prepared for all possible scenarios. Whatever the outcome is, it won’t threaten my life. Furthermore, I have your assistance. How can mere Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan hurt me?” Jian Wushuang grinned, looking confident in himself.

In fact, he did have a lot of confidence in himself.

“I have stopped using the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, and meanwhile, Gu King is also trying his best to heal his Spiritual Power. I am supposed to make a full recovery by the time the experts from the Ancient Demon Clan arrive. Should anything bad happen, I would immediately kill Jiu Xiu and use his Dragon Blood Secret Skill to escape. I am certain that I have a good chance of making my escape.”

Moreover, he was also mulling over a certain thought.

“If I can’t get my mother’s whereabouts from Jiu Xiu, maybe I can get an answer from Holy Master Dong Ming!”
