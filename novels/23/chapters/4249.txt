4250 Ruler Mountain Shaker

Along the way, Jian Wushuang had learned that the bearded Ultimate Ruler, Ruler Mountain Shaker, was as powerful as an unrivaled Ruler. he was a well-known heaven’s favorite in the universe.

However, geniuses were everywhere in the latter eight cities. Ruler Mountain Shaker’s strength was inferior to the others, so he joined the Overlord and became one of the six leaders.

“Brother Blood Sword, since you’ve become the overlord’s subordinate, we’re brothers now. I’m sure you don’t know much about the back eight cities, so i’ll explain it to you.” Ruler Mountain Shaker said with a laugh.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, Commander Mountain Shaker.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

!!

“Alright. First of all, the last eight cities are different from the first ten cities. The last eight cities are connected to each other, and as long as you have a pass scroll in your hand, you can go to any city without any restrictions. In other words, you can view the latter eight cities as a small world, while the eight cities are the eight great continents!”

“In the last eight cities, almost everyone will join a force because the fighting in the last eight cities is extremely fierce. One can die if they are not careful. If they only rely on fighting alone, it is almost impossible to gain a foothold in the last eight cities.” Commander Mountain Shaker said slowly.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and asked, “Commander Mountain Shaker, why are you talking about this battle?”

The commander smiled and continued, “Blood Sword, the battles in the last eight cities have been going on for a long time. For one thing, we’ve been living under the same sky, so there will always be some friction, which makes fighting inevitable. For another thing, the most important reason is the fight for The Investiture of the Gods!”

“The God Sealing Tablet?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with doubt. It was the first time he had heard of this name.

“Yes, the God Sealing Tablet is the most important thing in the eight cities! In the last eight cities, there are a total of 99 God Sealing Tablets, which represent the qualification to participate in the Great Clan Gathering. Only with the God Sealing Tablet can we, Rulers, enter the universe’s Great Clan Gathering 90000 years later!” Said Commander Mountain Shaker in a deep voice.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

Almost all the Rulers who had come to the Ancient Path of Stars had come for the Great Clan Gathering, so it was easy to imagine how fierce the competition for the God Sealing Tablet would be.

The two of them talked as they walked, and soon they arrived at the pavilion in the distance.

Not long after he entered the building, a divine armor guard suddenly ran over.

“Commander Mountain Shaker, The Investiture of the Gods has been found in the 12 cities. The Overlord has invited you over. He has something to discuss with you!”

Commander Mountain Shaker’s face darkened. He turned to Jian Wushuang and said, “Blood Sword, please wait for a moment. I’ll go see the Overlord first and help you get the godly armor and identity token. Wait for me here.”

With that, Commander Mountain Shaker hurried off with the divine armor guard.

“It’s fine. Commander Mountain Shaker, you can go ahead with your work.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After the Commander Mountain Shaker left, the pavilion immediately became quiet.

Jian Wushuang sat down with his legs crossed and his eyes flickered.

He finally understood a little about the situation in the last eight cities.

…

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Jian Wushuang did not waste any time and started to break through to the fourth level of sword principle origin.

He slowly closed his eyes and began to immerse himself in the comprehension of sword principle.

Back in the Tarot Ruins, he had swallowed the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass and broken through to the third level, origin of the sword.

Then, with the help of the remaining chaos sword intent from the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass, he pushed the third level of sword principle origin all the way to the peak.

After that, his comprehension of the origin of sword principle stopped and he was stuck at a bottleneck.

This continued until he entered the God Refining Tower.

“Sword principle of Gale, appear!”

Jian Wushuang opened his hands and a small whirlwind gradually formed in his palm. The sharp sword Qi shattered the void in all directions.

This was the sword principle of Gale!

Then, a Sword Saint Phantom from the ancient times appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

This was the fifth level of the Overlord’s sword path!

Then, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned red.

The scene in front of Jian Wushuang suddenly changed to the scene of Divine General Fei Hong massacring the Purgatory Sword Sect. There were mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

This was the sixth level of the slaughter Sword Dao!

The three great sword principles gushed out!

“Close!”

Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice. In an instant, the three sword principles from the God Refining Tower slowly merged together and turned into Jian Wushuang’s own sword principles!

At this point, Jian Wushuang’s shortcomings in breaking through the fourth level of sword principle had been made up!

However, this was not the end.

“And the seventh level, my own sword Dao!”

Jian Wushuang said slowly.

In an instant, memories regarding the seventh level of the God Refining Tower came flooding in like a tidal wave!

On the seventh level, he was facing himself!

On the seventh level, Jian Wushuang finally understood why some of his power would be absorbed by the void around the God Refining Tower in the previous levels.

That was because the God Refining Tower would simulate a person that was exactly like him!

However, it was a pity that the Jian Wushuang simulated by the God Refining Tower lacked the most fundamental thing!

That was the constitution of a perfect life form!

In that battle, Jian Wushuang had clearly seen his own strengths and weaknesses in sword principle. In the end, he had used the power of his divine body to kill his simulacrum!

“Boom!”

Jian Wushuang’s body let out a muffled sound.

The stagnant comprehension of the third level of the sword principle began to break through!

Three days later.

Clang!

A shocking sword essence exploded with Jian Wushuang as the center!

This sword essence was extremely sharp, as if it wanted to cut the firmament into pieces and split the chaos. It directly shot up into the sky!

“Fourth level, complete!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and two divine lights flashed past like lightning in the dark night.

The next moment.

The sword essence that shot up into the sky was all retracted.

Jian Wushuang stood up. After breaking through to the fourth level of sword principle origin, his aura became sharper and sharper. It was as if he was a peerless weapon, exuding a sharp and fierce power.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and immediately covered his aura, as if there was no difference from before.

At this moment, the sound of hurried footsteps could be heard outside the pavilion.

“Blood Sword.”

The bearded Ruler Mountain Shaker strode over.

He handed a black armor to Jian Wushuang and said, “Blood Sword, this is the godly armor of the Conqueror’s camp. It’s enough to block the Ultimate Ruler’s full-power attack. Put it on and come with me to the thirteenth city to fight for the God Sealing Tablet!

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He turned his right hand and put on the black divine armor. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Blood Sword, from now on, you will be the divine armor guards of the sixth legion under the Overlord’s command. Let’s not delay any further and head to the 13 cities.” Ruler Mountain Shaker growled.
