Chapter 464: Myriad Islands Lord’s trump card

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

The Demon Soul Lord was dead.

She had attempted to murder someone in the Saint Realm. Unfortunately she was killed by her opponent and his Puppet Fighter instead.

Jian Wushuang, who killed the Demon Soul Lord, looked very calm. It seemed as though it had been easy for him to kill the Demon Soul Lord. Soon, he turned his icy glare at the Myriad Islands Lord. Killing intent suffused him again.

The Demon Soul Lord and the Myriad Islands Lord had worked together catch him unaware.

The Demon Soul Lord had tried to distract him while the Myriad Islands Lord sneaked up behind him.

Compared to the Demon Soul Lord, Jian Wushuang felt more murderous intent toward the Myriad Islands Lord.

“Myriad Islands Lord, the Demon Soul Lord has already died. Now, it’s your turn.”

Jian Wushuang’s deep and low voice reverberated coldly through the palace.

The Myriad Islands Lord’s expression froze but he did not panic, nor was he terrified.

“Kill me? Only you and this Puppet Fighter?”

The Myriad Islands Lord looked disdainful. He turned his palm and soon an object showed up on it.

That was a scroll. The Myriad Islands Lord opened it. At the same time he launched several punches on it to make a few special marks. Soon, the scroll was filled with tremendous power. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Whoosh!

The activation of the scroll caused an Energy Shield to coalesce around the Myriad Islands Lord.

“Formation?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Energy Shield and narrowed his eyes.

“Little boy, you shouldn’t underestimate me. My Formation is the best in both camps, so it’s not as simple as what you see now. It’s a pity that I rushed here and didn’t have enough time to prepare, otherwise...” the Myriad Islands Lord sneered.

Jian Wushuang was quiet. He didn’t issue any commands, but the Blood Puppet flew to the Myriad Islands Lord without any hesitation.

Boom!

The Blood Puppet had landed a violent punch on the Energy Shield, with a power strong enough to kill an advanced lord. Its punch landed on the Energy Shield surrounding the Myriad Islands Lord and dented it. The Shield trembled as it erupted with a great deal of power that caused a strong roar.

The Energy Shield was intact. It had not been smashed and the Myriad Islands Lord who was inside the shield was not hurt.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang squinted.

The lords of both camps were amazed.

“What a powerful Defensive Formation, even the Marquis Puppet couldn’t break it.”

“No wonder the Myriad Islands Lord’s Formation is the best in both camps.”

“This Defensive Formation could save the Myriad Islands Lord.”

“As long as the Myriad Islands Lord has this Formation, it is impossible for the Swordsman to kill him.”

Jian Wushuang and his Marquis Puppet had easily killed the Demon Soul Lord who was a superior lord. That had stunned them.

Even though the Myriad Islands Lord was not as strong as the Demon Soul Lord, he was regarded as the first master of Formation in both camps. It would be more difficult to defeat him.

“The Formation looks good.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Energy Shield around the Myriad Islands Lord. He could tell that the Energy Shield was very unique and it could balance the energy by itself. After the attack from the Blood Puppet, the Energy Shield had consumed a bit of energy but had soon recovered.

“If I want to break the Energy Shield, I have to directly smash it with violent force. The power should only focus on one spot. However, the only person in both camps who is able to do that is the marquis Lord,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

A real marquis, an expert above Seven-cloud Realm, had terrifying power and was also an expert of human being. He would be able to exploit the manual and the unique skill.

By exploiting the unique skill, consolidating all power into a single point and unleashing that power instantly, one would be able to smash the Energy Shield.

However, even though the Blood Puppet was a marquis Level Puppet Fighter and had marquis battle strength, it was still only a Puppet Fighter. He didn’t know how to exploit the unique skill, wasn’t able to focus all the power to one spot. He also couldn’t control the timing of the explosion, so he wouldn’t be able to break the Energy Shield.

“Swordsman,” the Myriad Islands Lord raised his voice.

“You are only in the Saint Realm, but you have terrifying Realm and excellent strength. You are already the best of the intermediate lords. Moreover, your body is also very powerful. The Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt exploded near you, but you didn’t really get hurt. Now, you show us a marquis Level Puppet Fighter...”

“We lords really envy your ability and skills.”

Upon hearing this, the lords of both camps looked surprised.

Jian Wushuang’s Realm, his super powerful body, and the marquis Level Puppet Fighter made them jealous.

But Jian Wushuang was only in the Saint Realm.

“However, we only envy you. After all, you are not a real marquis expert. You want to kill me but you won’t be able to,” the Myriad Islands Lord said with a big laugh.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang looked up and stared at the Myriad Islands Lord coldly, “I don’t think so.”

Jian Wushuang took something out of the Interspatial Ring.

It was a gold longbow with a sharp golden arrow. The gold longbow radiated a fierce aura.

“A bow?”

Noticing the longbow, the lords were slightly shocked.

Jian Wushuang grinned and then threw the gold longbow to the Blood Puppet.

The Dragon King Bow... It was one of the opportunities that Jian Wushuang had received in the Marquis Beimo Cave Mansion. He had kept it with him but had never used it.

The Dragon King Bow was also a first-grade magic weapon and it contained great power.

More importantly, the bow was able to focus all the power to one spot and to unleash that power in an instant.

“Myriad Islands Lord, you sure are confident about the strength of the Energy Shield. I’d really like to see if my Blood Puppet can break your tortoise shell with this Dragon King Bow.”

While Jian Wushuang was speaking, the Blood Puppet was slowly pulling the bowstring of the Dragon King Bow.

While the Blood Puppet was only a Puppet Fighter and he didn’t know any unique skills, he was able to follow Jian Wushuang’s order to shoot an arrow.

As the bowstring was stretched, a terrifying power gathered at one point. The bowstring emitted a few flashes of dazzling golden light.

The Myriad Islands Lord who was being targeted by the Dragon King Arrow felt its tremendous power. His eyes narrowed.
