Chapter 2838: 10,000 Kilograms of Blood Wilderness Emperor Essence

——

“If I had known, I would have asked Yin Su’er to say hello for me.” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly, but he still followed the guard into the castle.

On the way, Jian Wushuang looked at the long line at the entrance and could not help asking, “Sir, what do these people do?”

“They?” The guard sneered and said, “They are some blacksmiths from different realms. There are blacksmiths of different levels. There are third or fourth-grade blacksmiths, fifth or even sixth-grade blacksmiths. They come here with only one purpose, which is to become apprentice blacksmiths in Fire Cloud Castle.”

“Apprentice? Why are apprentices so popular?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Of course. Although they are just apprentices, they still have the chance to see the scene of top blacksmiths refining weapons. If they are lucky, they might even be chosen by the castle lord and become his in-name disciples. That would be great.” The guard continued. “The castle lord now has a total of one personal disciple and six in-name disciples. Except for that personal disciple, the other six in-name disciples are all chosen from apprentices.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood.

He followed the guard into the castle and came to a side hall.

“Wait here. Lord fan Xin is receiving a Supreme Divine Master. He will come to see you when he is done,” the guard said.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked him.

The guard left quickly, while Jian Wushuang waited quietly in the side hall.

After waiting for four hours, a middle-aged man with a big belly finally came to the side hall.

“You must be Sword One, right?” The middle-aged man was only a Peak Divine Master, but he stood in front of Jian Wushuang without any respect or humility. On the contrary, he had a lofty attitude.

“Tsk, tsk, these blacksmiths are really arrogant.” Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart, but he still smiled on the surface. “It’s me. You must be Mr. Fan Xin, right?”

“Sit.” The middle-aged man, Fan Xin, who was one of Lord Mo’s in-name disciples, waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang immediately sat down beside him.

“Are you here to see Master?” Fan Xin glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha, my Master is the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. There are too many people who come to see him. He doesn’t have the time to meet so many people. Therefore, those who come to see him are usually received by us disciples. Unless some very high-ranking people come to see him in person, my master will personally receive them. So, if you have something to say, just tell me directly.” Fan Xin said.

Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He knew that it would be unrealistic for him to meet Lord Mo directly, so he had to go through Fan Xin. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“To tell you the truth, I’m here today because I hope that Lord Mo can personally refine another magic weapon for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ask master to refine a magic weapon?” Fan Xin looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise and could not help but smile. “Sword one, you’re only an Advanced Great Divine Master, right?

“With your strength, the magic weapon you use is only a superior divine treasure. Even if you have a lot of treasures and want to make a divine treasure, there are others in my Fire Cloud Castle who can do it. Why do you need my master to do it personally?”

“No, the magic weapon I want to make can only be made by Lord Mo himself,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“My master must make it himself?” Fan Xin’s expression changed, but then he said in a deep voice, “Sword One, my master is the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. It’s not easy for him to make the magic weapon, and it will cost a lot of money.”

“I know. When I came here, I asked around. If you want Lord Mo to make it himself, the price must be no less than 300,000 holy elixirs. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, can you afford 300,000 holy elixirs?” Fan Xin looked at him.

“I don’t have any ready-made holy elixirs, but I do have treasures that are worth more than 300,000 holy elixirs.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then took out the last piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal.

The Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal was about the size of an adult and weighed more than 10,000 pounds.

However, Jian Wushuang held it in his hand easily and weighed it casually.

“Mr. Fan Xin, do you recognize this crystal in my hand?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“This is... Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal?” Fan Xin, who was sitting casually on the chair, suddenly stood up. He looked at the crystal in Jian Wushuang’s hand with a trace of shock.

Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal was one of the most important materials for refining holy treasures.

As a weapon refiner, he had been dealing with all kinds of weapon refining materials all year round. How could he not recognize it?

“How heavy is such a big piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal?” Fan Xin exclaimed.

“I estimated that this Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal should weigh 12,000 pounds. On the market, one pound of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal is worth 100 holy elixirs. Moreover, it’s priceless. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Fan Xin could not help but gulp.

What Jian Wushuang said was naturally true.

Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystals were very rare and precious.

One pound of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal was more than enough to sell 100 saint elixirs. If they met people who needed it, one pound of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal could sell for 200 saint elixirs.

But 12,000 pounds of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystals... even if it was 100 saint elixirs per pound, it was still 1.2 million saint elixirs!

Under normal circumstances, an ordinary Immortal Saint who was not good at accumulating wealth would only have 500,000 to 600,000 saint elixirs.

Many Immortal Saints could not afford 1.2 million saint elixirs.

But now...

“Ms. Fan Xin, I wonder if my Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal is worth 300,000 saint elixirs. Can I ask Master Mo to help me?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“The price is enough, but I don’t know if I can ask the master to help me.” Fan Xin’s face had become extremely serious, and her attitude toward Jian Wushuang had obviously changed. “Mr. Sword One, please wait here for a moment. I’ll report this matter to senior brother Bi Yan and ask him to see you in person.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Judging from fan Xin’s tone, Jian Wushuang knew that Bi Yan was the only personal disciple under Lord Mo...

If he wanted to see Lord Mo, he had to go through Bi Yan.

“Then I’ll wait here.” Jian Wushuang smiled and put the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal into his interspatial ring.
