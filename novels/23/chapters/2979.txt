Chapter 2980: Fierce Battle

——

Hiding his aura?

Right, at this moment, everyone in the Barbarian King Team began to doubt whether Jian Wushuang was hiding his aura.

It could not be helped. The battle strength that Jian Wushuang displayed was too terrifying.

It was already comparable to a second rank True Saint.

How could he only be a Divine Master with such terrifying battle strength?

It was not just the Barbarian King Team…

Outside the Dragon Flame World, the triangular-shaped man in the Dark Temple and his six men in black were gathered together. In the mirror image in front of them, Jian Wushuang and Prince Qian Chen were fighting head-on.

The two of them were engaged in a heated battle, and it was obvious that Prince Qian Chen was slightly below them.

“How, how is this possible?”

“Among the experts of the 12 teams, there is actually someone who is on par with Prince Qian Chen and even has a slight advantage?”

“You must be joking.”

The man in the triangular helmet and his six subordinates were stunned.

What really stunned them was the divine power aura that Jian Wushuang emitted.

“Divine Master, this man is just a Divine Master?” A black-clothed man exclaimed.

“No, it can’t be a Divine Master. He must have deliberately concealed his aura. Quick, find out who this man is and his specific realm!” The man in the triangular helmet ordered.

“Yes.” A black-clothed man answered immediately and immediately handed a piece of information to the man in the triangular helmet.

“We’ve investigated it clearly. This person is called Heavenly Sword Marquis. He and a Peak False Saint in his team, named Xue Dong King, came from the 385th Lair. According to the information, Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed only at the Divine Master level,” the black-clothed man said respectfully.

“He is indeed only at the Divine Master level?” The man in the triangular helmet was stunned.

The few black-clothed men were also at a loss.

In the Beginning Divine Realm, geniuses were as numerous as the clouds. They were all clear about this point.

For example, His Highness Qian Chen was clearly a Peak False Saint. Moreover, he had just broken through not long ago, yet his battle prowess was comparable to a second-level True Saint. This kind of talent could be considered to be the best in the entire Beginning Divine Realm. That was why he was qualified to join the Heaven and Earth Palace, he would become a prince of the Heaven and Earth Palace. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, no matter how heaven-defying Prince Qian Chen was, he was still a Peak False Saint. The difference between a Peak False Saint and a second level True Saint was only two levels. They could still accept it.

However, the Heavenly Sword Marquis who appeared in front of them and could contend against Prince Qian Chen was only a Divine Master.

There was a difference of three realms between a Divine Master and a second level True Saint. There was a huge difference between them. How could they accept this?

“S-sir.” A black-robed man looked at the man in the triangular helmet carefully.

“Quick, contact the higher-ups of the heaven-cleaving union and tell them that we have found a super monster. A super monster that is even stronger than Qian Chen. No, it is ten or even a hundred times stronger than your Qian Chen!” The eyes of the man in the triangular helmet shone with an unprecedented light.

“Send the message!”

“Yes!”

The black-clothed men immediately sent the message while trembling.

The man in the triangular helmet stared at the mirror image in front of him.

In the mirror image, Jian Wushuang and His Highness Qian Chen were already fighting head-on.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The two had been fighting crazily hundreds of times in the void.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two figures finally separated again.

“Haha, awesome, awesome!” Wearing a black robe and holding a saber, His Highness Qian Chen’s eyes flashed with a fierce light. He did not change his expression at all because he was slightly at a disadvantage in the fierce battle.

As for Jian Wushuang, he looked very serious.

“This guy is just a Peak False Saint, but his battle strength is so amazing. I have perfectly displayed the fifth level of the reincarnation sword formation, saint slayer, and my own sword skills. But when I fought with him, I only gained a slight advantage. I can see that he has more powerful skills that he hasn’t used yet,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He had lived for two lifetimes and had lived until now. He had fought countless battles with others and had encountered countless dangers and tribulations.

His intuition had always been very accurate. Right now, he felt that this black-robed young man in front of him should still have some tricks up his sleeve.

As expected, this black-robed young man, His Highness Qian Chen, moved once again.

“You, come and receive another strike from me!”

His Highness Qian Chen’s voice shook the sky and reverberated with a rumble.

While he was speaking, he had already raised the saber in his hand high up.

When he raised it, a powerful saber intent instantly started to gather in his saber. There was also a large amount of black air flowing out from his divine body, causing the void around him to turn completely dark.

Even his eyes became pitch-black and deep, like the stars in the sky and earth.

Standing there, His Highness Qian Chen had not swung his saber yet, but the terrifying saber essence and power had already suffocated the experts of the Barbarian King Team around the battlefield.

It was also quiet in the sky and earth.

“This saber move…”

Jian Wushuang stared at His Highness Qian Chen with a hint of shock in his eyes.

He could feel the shocking power contained in the saber.

This power made him a little shocked.

“Die!”

Prince Qian Chen finally attacked.

He waved the saber in his hand.

The world was still calm, but under this tranquility, a milky way swept out directly.

This milky way came from the nine heavens. It was beautiful, magnificent, and majestic.

As soon as it appeared, the experts of the Barbarian King Team were instantly intoxicated and could not extricate themselves for a long time.

Even Jian Wushuang had never seen such a beautiful and intoxicating saber light. He was almost absent-minded, but after experiencing countless life-and-death battles, he was able to remain absolutely rational.

When the milky way attacked, he immediately made his move.

“Swish!”

The 18 Star Luo Swords exerted their power to the maximum. The power of the Samsara Sword Formation suddenly soared and pierced through.

But the result was… ‘Bang!’

With a loud sound, the Samsara Sword Formation shook crazily and directly collapsed, turning back into 18 divine swords.

“Sure enough, the power of this move is too strong. The Samsara Sword Formation can’t withstand it. I’m afraid that even if I use Storm, I won’t be able to block this move head-on,” Jian Wushuang muttered, but his eyes were exceptionally calm.

Seeing that the beautiful milky way was about to reach him, Jian Wushuang gently raised his hand.

“Buzz!” The power of time and space suddenly burst out.

Space-time divine skill, one point heaven skill!
