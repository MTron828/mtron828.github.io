Chapter 1050: The Dust Has Settled

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory had finally left.

He had left so firmly and decisively.

With him gone, the only one remaining was Celestial Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan.

Naturally, Dong Ming alone posed much less of a threat to Jian Wushuang.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory has left; aren’t you joining him, Celestial Master Dong Ming? Do you want me to chase you away?” Jian Wushuang asked, chuckling.

Dong Ming’s face darkened before he replied, “The Ancient Demon Clan is willing to forget what you’ve done as long as you’re willing to let Jiu Jian go. Moreover, we’re willing to be on good terms with you. We’ll even treat you like our esteemed guest if you visit us. What say you?”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow.

The crowd of spectating experts began sighing one after another upon hearing Dong Ming’s words.

They could hear the defeat in those words.

The fact was that he had no choice but to admit defeat.

Jian Wushuang’s self-protection methods were too strong. Were it not because he was unwilling to kill Jiu Xiu, he would have vanished completely and there would be nothing that the Ancient Demon Clan could do about it.

“Do you know how much effort I spent to capture him? But you think you can just say a few sentences and convince me to let him off? You sure know how to daydream,” Jian Wushuang said with a sneer.

“Jian Wushuang, are you really bent on making the Ancient Demon Clan your enemy?” Dong Ming asked angrily. “I’m aware of your origin. Our clan ought to have nothing to do with you and neither have we ever offended you. Just why exactly are you refusing to let Jiu Jian go?”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang laughed out loud.

His eyes turned exceptionally sharp and cold. “Did you think I’m so idle as to provoke your clan for no reason?”

“Humph! Let me tell you just how immense the grudge between your clan and me is!”

“Dao Master Jiu Jian, no, Jiu Xiu!”

“2,000 years ago in the Ancient World, he kidnapped my mother and exterminated her clan. He even stole the soul of my father’s sword and forced him to a corner!”

“I was so weak back then, I wasn’t even in the Skyscraping Realm. I had no way of preventing this from happening!”

“Now, two thousand years have passed and I still have no idea where my mother is. Meanwhile two thousand years ago, my father chose a near-certain path of becoming a Reincarnator just so he could see my mother again!”

“He caused all of this!”

“Celestial Master Dong Ming, what say you? Do you still think there’s no grudge between Dao Master Jiu Jian and me?”

Jian Wushuang chuckled. “Such an immense grudge… yet you dare say there’s no grudge?”

“It’s a pity that I’m currently not strong enough. Otherwise, I would’ve razed your entire clan to the ground!”

Jian Wushuang’s icy-cold voice full of endless fury reverberated in the air, shocking all the spectating experts around him.

Dong Ming appeared deeply stunned.

“Jiu Xiu kidnapped your mother?”

“Two thousand years ago in the Ancient World?”

“Isn’t that…”

He stared at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“Jian Wushuang is the son that she left behind in the Ancient World?”

“It’s him?”

Dong Ming was completely stupefied.

2,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang was just a kid.

Yet in that short span of time, the child that his clan had ignored and even despised for having inferior bloodline… had unexpectedly grown up to be this strong.

How was this possible?

After a brief shock, Dong Ming sank into silence.

He finally spoke after a long silence. “Jian… Jian Wushuang…”

Even his tone became strange.

“Your mother is one of our clansmen, and that essentially makes you one of us,” he said.

“The Ancient Demon Clan?” Jian Wushuang sneered. “How could I be good enough to be a part of one of the four great clans with such incredible information bank and great strength?”

“Whether or not you’re willing to admit it, you share part of our clan’s blood flowing through you. I finally found my answer as to why you were able to use the Ancient God Power. It seems that you’ve coincidentally awakened your Ancient God bloodline,” Dong Ming replied.

“Our clan possesses both the Ancient God and Divine Demon bloodlines, though the latter was our main bloodline. The bloodline awakened in most of our clansmen was the Divine Demon bloodline as well but every now and then, there would be certain clansmen who would awaken the Ancient God bloodline. You’re one of those clansmen.”

Clamor began rising in the crowd after they heard Dong Ming’s words.

They never once expected that there would be such a sharp turn of events.

To think this man who suppressed Dao Master Jiu Jian and caused himself to be so frantically hunted would have such a “wondrous” relationship with the Ancient Demon Clan.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s true that our Ancient Demon Clan has owed you and your father. I can understand why you’d take such a drastic action against us. But I hope you can guarantee Jiu Jian’s safety because it’ll do your mother good if he’s still alive. That’s all I have to say.”

Dong Ming promptly turned around and took leave after leaving behind these words. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Despite his earlier rage and desire to put Jian Wushuang to death, he could no longer find it himself to be angry after learning that the latter was the son left behind in the Ancient World back then. Neither he cared for Dong Ming any longer.

With that, even Dong Ming was gone.

But the words he left behind made Jian Wushuang frown.

“It’ll do Mother good if Jiu Xiu is still alive?” He narrowed his eyes as many thoughts surfaced on his mind.

But he swiftly shook his head and stopped mulling over it.

“Whatever it is, the crisis this time is now over and Jiu Xiu is in my hands. I can slowly come up with a way to make him talk.”

“Third Brother.”

Su Rou walked over to Jian Wushuang. Staring at his bloodied body and pale face, she said in a worried voice, “How are you?”

“I’m fine,” Jian Wushuang said, smiling.

Despite sustaining injuries after forcefully receiving three of Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s attacks, Gu King didn’t stop healing him from within. Right now, he was basically in a steady condition and he would recover completely before long.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and Celestial Master Dong Ming might be gone now but it’s hard to say if they won’t continue making trouble for you. How about you return to the Blood Asura Clan with me, just in case?” Su Rou suggested.

“The Blood Asura Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s heart jumped. He muttered to himself for a moment before giving a small nod.

He then promptly followed after Su Rou and left for the Blood Asura Clan.
