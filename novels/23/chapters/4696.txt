4698 The Vast Mirage (1)

There were only ten people on the first ship. Excluding Jian Wushuang and Chun Qiu, the rest were the Young Emperor’s followers.

Jian Wushuang had no opinion on this. If it were him, he would naturally use the same method.

Apart from the two of them conversing, the other purple-robed figures were like dead people, each standing in a corner of the deck.

After several days of travel, the ten ships left the Six Heavens Realms and entered a vast and barren galaxy.

A boundless ocean stretched across the world like a still ribbon.

The hundreds of millions of stars above his head were giving off a strange light, which was extremely beautiful.

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting at the bow of the ship, waved his hand and picked a star. He used Yan power to squeeze it into a round ball the size of a thumb and embellished it in the galaxy again.

From the Six Heavens to the other worlds, they used the most difficult path — the sea crossing. Jian Wushuang guessed that it was to prevent experts from the other worlds from interfering.

For the sea, variables were very common. Tides and huge waves were common. What was more important was the unknown that had been silent in the sea for countless years.

The giant ship in the lead fell into the huge sea, causing layers of ripples on the surface of the sea. Then, it continued to move forward without stopping.

The speed in the water was much slower than in the air.

However, according to the map given by the Young Emperor, they would reach their final destination in three years at most.

Time had become the most meaningless thing when sailing in this huge sea.

However, Chun Qiu was still extremely excited. This was the first time he had gone on a long journey with complete freedom, and he had imprinted everything he saw in his mind.

Jian Wushuang was already exhausted, so he sat on the bow of the ship and began to meditate.

Although his cultivation realm had been completely stabilized in the Yan Immortal realm, the damage caused by the clay idol was still indelible. For a long time, his meridians showed a unique aging state.

It was only after he entered the Great Yan Domain that the irreversible injuries in his body miraculously recovered. Jian Wushuang was very confused but he had no clue.

After he began to diligently cultivate and meditate, the entire sea became silent.

After more than half a year, Jian Wushuang seemed to have entered a different kind of ethereal state. Memories that were so ancient that he had almost forgotten began to appear in his mind again.

The slightly hunchbacked Elder Shi Ting stepped on countless corpses and blood as he walked over. His white robe was already soaked in the divine blood.

Old Master, who carried the power of the entire Black Sea, also stepped forward. He looked at Jian Wushuang with his dark eyes and said nothing. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Another fog appeared in the depths of his memory, and that strangely familiar yet extremely strange aura rose.

“You shouldn’t have come. The catastrophe here is far from what you can bear…”

“You shouldn’t have come. The catastrophe here is far from what you can bear…”

A mysterious and arrogant voice exploded in Jian Wushuang’s divine sense. At the same time, all the bodies that had died or disappeared began to overlap and finally turned into a cloud of thick black smoke.

“Leave or sleep. You shouldn’t have to bear all this. Leaving is the best choice.”

The extremely familiar voice cleared Jian Wushuang’s mind from the chaos.

However, as soon as he woke up, all the memories that had appeared in his spiritual sense instantly disappeared, not even leaving a trace.

“Is, is that you…” Jian Wushuang’s body shook slightly and his face was extremely pale.

However, at this moment, a silly laugh came from behind him.

“Imperial Father, why are you here? I’ve been unfilial. I’ve come to see you now.”

Jian Wushuang turned around subconsciously and saw that Chun Qiu had suddenly jumped up from the deck and was flying toward the dark sea.

He saw it clearly. Almost at the moment when Chun Qiu jumped, he released Yan power and pulled him back.

Soon after, wisps of black light appeared at the edge of the fence and disappeared in an instant.

He threw Chun Qiu on the deck and quickly looked down at the sea.

However, other than the pitch-black seawater, there was no other trace.

The few purple-robed figures on the deck had also noticed that something was wrong and gathered together as if they were facing a great enemy.

“What’s wrong? why do I feel backache after sleeping?” Chun Qiu sat up on the deck and opened his sleepy eyes.

“Don’t sleep, there’s something strange in the sea,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice. At the same time, he released his Yan power and prepared to explore the sea.

However, what surprised him was that even Yan power could not remain on the surface of the sea. It only took a moment for Yan power to be devoured.

“There’s something strange in the sea?” Chun Qiu jumped up and looked nervously at the sea, trying to find the enemy hiding in the dark.

However, everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.

“I hope I’m overthinking it,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The eight purple-robed figures returned to their previous standing positions and remained silent.

Jian Wushuang was not worried about them at all and was too lazy to deal with them. After all, eight of them had the strength of a Yan Immortal, which was enough to deal with most of the dangers.

As for the other nine ships, Jian Wushuang roughly glanced at them and found that there were no less than five Yan Immortals.

After surviving the fright without any danger, he found it difficult to enter the state of meditation. The reason was that he could not tell if it was a dream or an illusion in his spiritual sense, and the scene that appeared in his mind had thrown his mind into chaos.

After he managed to dispel the messy information in his heart, Jian Wushuang forced himself to continue meditating.

However, not long after, Chun Qiu’s surprised voice rang in his ears. “H-how is this possible? How can these things be here, in a Realm that no one has ever set foot in?”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and what he saw next shocked him.

In the chaotic mist, there were thousands of jade buildings with auspicious light flickering in and out of them. It was a shocking sight.

The pavilion-like scene in the sky appeared in front of his eyes. It was like a dream, but it was extremely real.

“Could it be a mirage?”

Jian Wushuang, who had been cultivating since he was a nobody, had comprehended thousands of Great Daos. Among them, he knew a thing or two about the Dao of Mountain Spirits.

This mirage was nothing more than a wonder, but there were also spiritual monsters who used this illusion to confuse cultivators, dragging them into the deep sea to devour them.

However, what kind of almighty spiritual monster was it that could use illusions to fool Yan Immortals?

Jian Wushuang focused his attention to get rid of the fog in front of him and looked forward again. Soon, he was surprised.

The wonder that was thought to be a mirage and illusion was actually real!

To be able to spend such a terrifying amount of energy to build these magnificent buildings, what kind of supreme power would it be?

Even the rest of the purple-robed men were on their guard.
