Chapter 1674: Hunting Plan!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Space Tunnel connected the independent space to the outside but it was still the bottom of the dark river.

Jian Wushuang, who had returned to the bottom of the rive,r spread his soul power at the first instant.

After twenty years, the dark river settled down entirely. The Star Demons that chased after Jian Wushuang to the bottom of the river back then had already returned to the shore.

Jian Wushuang slowly got closer to the shore.

Although he was underwater, Jian Wushuang’s soul power covered everything on the shore.

“As expected, the Star Demon didn’t return to the underground,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

The Star Demon Clan was very unique.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang had chased after Real God Zi Ye and come into the dark region, the Star Demons were hidden deep in the underground. However, since they were startled, the Star Demons had climbed up from the underground. In a short time, they wouldn’t return to the underground. Jian Wushuang naturally couldn’t leave the dark region in silence.

“There are so many of them,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in surprise.

Merely within the coverage of his soul power, there were more than thousands of Star Demons.

Among the thousands of Star Demons, almost all were adult Star Demons who possessed demon cores. There were many Two-Horned and Three-Horned Star Demons.

Jian Wushuang aimed at the region with the most densely populated Star Demons, then he moved towards the region underwater.

At the same time, there was a scroll painting that appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand. When he got closer to the region, he threw the scroll painting into the dark void above. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The scroll painting instantly flowed into the dark void.

Rumble. Heaven and earth shook.

The Star Demons at the scene, including those strong Three-Horns Green Star Demons and Three-Horns Crimson Star Demons had yet to respond but the dark void above took a drastic change.

A huge, enchanting scroll painting world surfaced. The scroll painting world covered the entire sky like water flowing gracefully.

In the scroll painting, there were nine pieces of land.

The boundless aura spread across from the scroll painting world that attracted the Star Demons below to notice it and they let out groans and roars.

There was a large number of Star Demons roaring but there was no Star Demon that noticed Jian Wushuang who was hiding in the water.

Until the boundless divine power swept out from Jian Wushuang’s body to evaporate the surrounding river water and caused a huge movement, the Star Demons slowly noticed his existence.

“Human, human cultivator!”

“Eat!”

“Kill! Kil!!”

A large number of Star Demons instantly swarmed over and charged at Jian Wushuang.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang was also soaring with murderous intention.

“Mountain river as palm and nine-province as print!”

“A seal breaks heaven!”

Jian Wushuang uttered every single word coldly and every word contained a special magic power.

In the scroll painting world, the nine lands suddenly became alive. One of them even surfaced from the scroll painting world gradually.

A terrifying pressure pressed over madly.

The Star Demons that were within the coverage of the land felt the pressure and their roars became more shrill and mad.

“Begone!”

There was a sharp gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The lofty land finally descended and pressed onto the vast land before Jian Wushuang.

In an instant, the tens of thousands of miles of vast land was crushed by the lofty land while the Star Demons roared in madness.

A terrifying power exploded entirely and those Star Demons almost instantly crushed them into pieces under the pressure of the lofty land.

Rumble. A terrifying power formed into storm that dispersed in all directions.

Very soon, everything settled down. The Mountain River Map rolled up and Jian Wushuang kept it.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and swept his soul power out. He could clearly see within the expanse of tens of thousand miles crushed by the lofty land before him, it had originally had a large number of Star Demons but then there were only three Star Demons that were alive.

The three Star Demons were Three-Horns Crimson Star Demon, which could be compared favorably with an expert on human Real God ranking list. They could barely survive the crush of the lofty land.

But besides the three Crimson Star Demons, the rest of the one thousand Star Demons were dead. In the huge land, rays of black light glowed. The lights were demon cores. In a glance, there were at least a thousand of them.

“So many demon cores. I’ll see how many can I get.”

Jian Wushuang licked his lips and there was a flash of heat in his eyes. The next moment, he soared up into a statue of dark gold Ancient God and the statue revealed four heads and eight arms at the same time. The divine power in Jian Wushuang started burning with madness and, in the next moment, he gave full play to the secret skill of Dragon Blood to his limit.

Swoosh!

There was a ray of golden lightning suddenly sweeping out and it barged into the expanse of tens of thousands of miles that was crushed by Sky Breaking Seal. That ray sucked in the floating demon cores into his Qian Kun ring.

In the coverage of the tens of thousands of miles, the three Green Star Demons that weren’t killed earlier saw Jian Wushuang’s movement and they immediately let out a sad and shrill scream. Then, they plunged towards Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Besides, in the expanse of tens of thousands of miles, there were still Demon Stars that were charging over madly.

Among the three Crimson Star Demons, the one who was closest to Jian Wushuang only needed at most two breaths to get to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang tried his best to take in as many demon cores as possible within the two breaths.

“Take! Take!”

Jian Wushuang seized the time to collect them.

Two breaths’ time passed in the blink of an eye. The first Crimson Star Demon had already arrived.

Jian Wushuang was shocked at the sight and acted without hesitation,

“Escape!!”

Under the amplitude of the secret skill of Dragon Blood, Jian Wushuang’s speed was shockingly fast and he cast a lot of shadows at the same time. Although the shadows couldn’t confuse the Crimson Star Demons, Jian Wushuang’s speed increased slightly with the aid of his martial art motion.

As he ran at full speed, Jian Wushuang arrived at the black river again after a short while and he instantly dived down into the river.

The Star Demons naturally dived down into the river as well. They were chasing after Jian Wushuang madly.

In the deepest bottom of the river, there was a space tunnel. Jian Wushuang snuck into the space tunnel and vanished before the Star Demons that were chasing after him.

Swoosh!

A dark golden flowing light burst out from another end of the space tunnel and appeared in the independent space again.

The dark golden flowing light dispersed and Jian Wushuang’s body was slowly revealed.

At that very moment, he looked surprised.

“Done!”

“My hunting plan worked out!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and he was really excited.
