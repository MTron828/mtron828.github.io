In the depth of the black castle, at the dinner banquet.

“Brother Cang Yu, Brother Qi Sha, thank you so much,” Sir God Xing Xiang said heartily with a cup of wine in his hand.

“No big deal, Brother Xing Xiang. It’s as easy as lifting a hand. It’s nothing. Plus, we are friends,” Sir God Qi Sha said.

“I work for rewards. Sir God Xing Xiang, you offered enough rewards and I would, of??course, do my best,” Sir God Cang Yu smiled gently.

“Haha, Brother Cang Yu is very realistic,” Sir God Xing Xiang laughed.

The three Sir Gods were chatting casually. Suddenly…

“Sir God Xing Xiang, come out and greet death!”

The bright and loud voice that contained a terrifying pressure instantly covered the entire castle. It was extremely imposing.

Countless maids and servants in the castle were shivering in fear because of the pressure. There were some beauties, who were dancing at the banquet, who knelt down in terror as well.

The three of them who had been chatting earlier suddenly looked unhappy. The smile on Sir God Xing Xiang’s face froze.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

There were three fierce auras that burst out simultaneously. The three Sir Gods soared up and appeared in the void above.

They stopped and instantly noticed the young man carrying a sword.

“Real God?” Sir God Cang Yu was surprised, “Although he is only a Real God, his aura is terrifyingly strong, much stronger than the three of ours. If I’m not mistaken, he should be the super genius from Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang, who was listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, Sword Emperor!”

“Sword Emperor, the sixty-first place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list?” Sir God Qi Sha squinted his eyes.

On the other hand, Sir God Xing Xiang’s face grew grave, “Jian Wushuang, you have guts! Your Lineage of Star once killed three of my lineal disciples. I didn’t find trouble with you but you barged into my place?”

“Humph, that’s because you assassinated one of Lineage of Star’s expert first,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold, “Save that bullshit. I came here today to kill you!”

“Haha, you put it in such a nice way. Who do you think you are? The old monster of Star Palace?” Sir God Xing Xiang sneered as he looked at the other two persons next to him, “Brother Cang Yu, Brother Qi Sha, Lineage of Star is being such a bully. I wonder if the two of you are willing to lend a helping hand. I, Xing Xiang, will remember what you did. If there were to be any help needed in the future, I would not refuse to help.”

Although Sir God Xing Xiang was reluctant to admit inferiority, he knew that it was impossible for him to match evenly with Jian Wushuang, who was listed on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list that possess fighting power of an Emperor God alone. Hence, he naturally dragged in the other two Sir Gods next to him.

The two Sir Gods were like him, they were top Sir Gods.

Especially Sir God Cang Yu, who was also listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list as a Sir God but at a lower rank. He once fought with an Emperor God and he survived. In addition, there was Sir God Xing Xiang and Sir God Qi Sha… The three of them teamed up might not be able to do anything to Jian Wushuang, but they definitely could fight a battle with Jian Wushuang.

Hearing what Sir God Xiang Xiang had to say, Sir God Qi Sha agreed without hesitation, “Brother Xing Xiang, don’t worry about it. If Jian Wushuang wants to lay a finger on you, he has to receive approval from the two of us.”

Sir God Cang Yu hesitated for a while but he replied, “Jian Wushuang, Qi Sha and I accepted Xing Xiang’s invitation to be here. We have yet to take care of the task on hand. I can’t let you kill him. So… please leave.”

“If you won’t leave, stay and die together!” Jian Wushuang had soaring murderous intention.

“Arrogant!” Sir God Qi Sha was furious.

“Jian Wushuang, you are too arrogant,” Sir God Cang Yu was furious too.

“Haha, as Jian Wushuang is asking for trouble, the three of us shall grant his wish,” Sir God Xing Xiang smirked coldly.

Instantly…

The three figures turned into three rays of flowing lights that burst out.

The three of them knew Jian Wushuang’s power and they didn’t dare to act recklessly. The moment they attacked, they went all-out.

Sir God Xing Xiang’s body was covered by a layer of magic clouds while there were eight ancient shadows that appeared behind him. The eight ancient shadows were huge and his body increased to three meters tall. With a malicious smile, the eight ancient shadows pressed at Jian Wushuang with boundless terrifying aura.

Sir God Qi Sha was soaring with imposing aura. His body moved and there was instantly a huge storm around him. Boundless murderous aura swept out. Die! Die! Die! A soaring sword intention filled the air while he held a creepy crimson blade and turned illusionary in silence.

Sir God Cang Yu, who was the strongest, suddenly increased in size to ten zhang tall. He was showering in warm sunlight as though he was the ruler of the universe. He was wearing a gentle smile and everyone found it friendly. However, he already had strong divine power concentrated in his hands. The bolt of divine power was enough to split the sky and break the earth.

Looking at the three Sir God launching attacks at the same time, Jian Wushuang’s eyes burst out lights.

“Courting death!”

Jian Wushuang roared without taking a step back and he flipped his palm.

There was billowing divine power with ancient tribe bloodline power that suddenly burst out to his ultimate limit.

Hong!

He swung his palm.

It was as though his palm contained the entire reincarnation. It was Reincarnation Palm derived from the terrifying palm that One-star Man had left in his head the other day.

Hualala. The void shattered and a huge palm print extended and grabbed Sir God Xing Xiang at the far front.

Sir God Xing Xiang let out an angry roar and the eight ancient shadows behind him let out an earth-shattering roar as well.

However, the very next moment, it stopped.

The huge palm print that contained the entire reincarnation covered Sir God Xing Xiang’s body, including the eight ancient shadows altogether, and it gripped tightly.

Bang! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The eight ancient shadows collapsed at the same time. Sir God Xing Xiang only let out a groan in pain at his last moment before his divine body was crushed under the palm.

With one palm, Sir God Xing Xiang died on the spot.

“How is it possible?”

Sir God Cang Yu and Sir God Qi Sha stared.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was powerful and possessed fighting power of an Emperor God. Hence, the three of them had teamed up. However, Jian Wushaung had ignored the two of them and killed Sir God Xing Xiang with one simple palm. Such power…

“Be careful!” Sir God Cang Yu suddenly spoke in terror.

“What?” Sir God Qi Sha’s face grew grave. Just as he came back to reality, there was a resplendent golden light that appeared behind him.

The golden light gave out a boundless, chilly, brilliant gleam. It was Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword.

There was only one Hong Jun Golden Sword but that one sword made Sir God Qi Sha feel instant hopelessness.

Psst!

A golden light swept past and Hong Jun Golden Sword pierced Sir God Qi Sha’s head straightway.

Sir God Qi Sha’s power had yet to be displayed. The surrounding storm had yet to burst out but he had already followed Sir God Xing Xiang’s footstep to death.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body turned illusory and he appeared before Sir God Cang Yu in the end.
