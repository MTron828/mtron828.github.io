Chapter 2332: I Won’t Allow It

Water Fairy Island was one of the clans that was ranked in the top ten in the Wusha Barren Region.

Both the Dongzuo Sect and the Thunder Sound Sect were less powerful than the Water Fairy Island.

If the Water Fairy Island wanted to destroy the Lin Family, it would be as easy as killing an ant.

“Zhuge Family Head, you might not know this, but there are more than two hundred Chaotic Divine Demons in the Water Fairy Island and countless extraordinary disciples. Even though Yan Que is a disciple of the Water Fairy Island, she is an ordinary disciple and is not an influential person. She is not close to any of the other disciples or elders within the Water Fairy Island. Hence, the Water Fairy Island might not even care at all,” Elder Chen said.

“Even so, she is still a disciple from the Water Fairy Island. If she is killed just like this and the Water Fairy Island does not take revenge for her, won’t it be bad for their reputation?” Zhuge Yuanchong said.

“No. The Water Fairy Island will definitely do something for her. After all, she is a disciple from the Water Fairy Island and people cannot just kill her and not pay a price. However, there is no telling when they will take revenge for her. If I am not wrong, there are no disciples or experts from the Water Fairy Island around this area. If one passed by, he would definitely come by.”

“However, knowing the Water Fairy Island, they would just teach the Lin Mansion a lesson. They would not annihilate them to serve as a warning for others as the Water Fairy Island is already well known by people as a prestigious and powerful clan,” Elder Chen said.

“That is all? Forget it then, we never expected the Water Fairy Island to help us achieve our plan,” Zhuge Yuanchong said.

“Alright everyone. Go and prepare. Once that lord leaves the Anjiu Prefecture and the Commandery Governor announces that he is going to shut himself off from the world to cultivate, we will execute our plan.”

“Roger.”

The experts from the Zhuge Family nodded their heads respectfully and left.

However, a few Chaotic Divine Demons from the Zhuge Family and some of the people from Tian Zuo Sect stayed behind. Zhuge Hong was one of those who stayed.

Soon, the door to the pavilion opened again as a figure fully covered in a black cloak walked in.

“Greetings, Zhuge Family head and the lords from Tian Zuo Sect. I am Xiang Tuo.” The figure bowed slightly as he removed his black cloak, revealing his youthful face.

“I never expected the Xiang Family to send you over.” Zhuge Hong looked at Xiang Tuo with great interest.

Xiang Tuo was the most talented young man from the Xiang family. He was as talented as Zhuge Hong and a part of a clan.

“What we are planning to do is too important. My family head is paying much attention to it.” Xiang Tuo smiled.

“Do you ask the Golden Cauldron Sect for help?” Zhuge Hong asked.

“I did not ask the experts from my clan for help. We should not need their help, right?” Xiang Tuo asked.

“Yes. With the help of the Tian Zuo Sect, the overall power level of the Zhuge family is far above that of the Lin Family. As long as the Xiang Family is willing to help, we can capture the Lin Mansion easily without asking the Golden Cauldron Sect for help,” Zhuge Yuanchong nodded his head slightly and said.

If the experts from the Lin Mansion heard this conversation, they would be shocked.

The Xiang family was also one of the six top-tier families within the Anjiu Prefecture. It was extremely powerful. They had a total of four Chaotic Divine Demons and ten Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demons. This lineup made the Xiang family the most powerful family in the Anjiu Prefecture.

And the Zhuge family had allied with the Xiang Family?

“This time, the Xiang family will send three Chaotic Divine Demon, ten Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demons. Are you satisfied with this lineup?” Xiang Tuo asked.

“Yes, absolutely satisfied.” Zhuge Yuanchong’s eyes lit up and the remaining people in the room started smiling. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Zhuge Family was already more powerful than the Lin Family. Now that the Xiang Family had provided so many experts, the Lin Family would have no way to defeat them if nothing went wrong.

“Then let us discuss how to split the territory and resources that the Lin Family is controlling after we have defeated them.”

The representatives from both families started discussing. Very quickly, they came to an agreement.

...

Lin Mansion.

“Brother Wushuang. My father has ordered me to bring you to the Purple Virtue Hall when the experts from Zhuge Family attacks,” Lin Yan said.

“Purple Virtue Hall?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had been living in the Lin Mansion for around three years. He was very familiar with this place. The Purple Virtue Hall was located at the outermost area of the Lin Mansion. It was located near the backdoor of the mansion.

“Not just the two of us. He has asked me to bring along your mother, Qingqing, the talented young disciples and the important family members along. We will gather at the Purple Virtue Hall and one of the senior brothers will protect us. If the Lin Mansion manages to stop the Zhuge Family, everything will be alright. If we cannot, then...”

Lin Yan fell silent.

“If they fail, your father will ask Brother Tao and one of the senior brothers to escort us to escape this place, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Yan and finished his sentence.

“Yes.” Lin Yan nodded his head heavily.

Jian Wushuang could understand why Lin Tiefeng had made this call.

Lin Tiefeng was the family head. Even though he felt that the Lin Family could stop the Zhuge Family, he was planning for the worst.

If the experts from the Lin Family could not stop them, the entire Lin mansion could be massacred. The important people from this family had to escape this massacre immediately.

“If that were the case, he would order all the experts and disciples from the Lin Family to escape. These experts and disciples will cover us and leave the Lin Mansion after we left. The reason why we are still here is because the situation is still under control. Furthermore, the Lin Mansion will be in a mess if we leave now,” Lin Yan said.

“You father is doing the right thing.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

If these talented disciples and family members left now, it would show the experts that the Lin Mansion had saught help from that the Lin Family was not confident in defeating their enemies. Furthermore, if the Zhuge Family found out, they would target these disciples and family members. This would result in greater losses.

“We will follow your father’s orders and stay within the Purple Virtue Hall,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Lin Yan nodded his head in agreement. He then asked, “Brother Wushuang, do you think that we will have to evacuate?”

“Nope.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head straight away.

“Why? How are you so confident?” Lin Yan looked at Jian Wushuang and asked.

“Because I will not allow it.” Jian Wushuang looked Lin Yan in the eye. He did not elaborate further.

In the blink of an eye, eight days passed.

On this day, that Lord left, and the Commandery Governor continued to shut himself away from the rest of the world and cultivate. The Lin Family and the Zhuge Family received the news at the same time.
