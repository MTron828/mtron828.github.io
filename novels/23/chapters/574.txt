Chapter 575: Enhanced Magic Thunderbolt

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Temple Master Black Spirit’s cold voice resounded throughout the entire area.

It shook both sides and caused a commotion among the horde of Demonic Beast.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor narrowed his eyes while staring at Temple Master Black Spirit. Her words were so domineering that he did not dare to question them.

He was very clear about how terrifying Temple Master Black Spirit was. If he drove her crazy, she would be able to kill him.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, Sword Emperor is just an outsider. Are you really going to fight for him?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said in a low voice.

Temple Master Black Spirit wore a firm expression, but the human experts behind her furrowed their eyebrows.

“Sword Emperor is just an outsider. To fight Crystal-armored Monster Emperor for an outsider, it isn’t worth it!”

“Temple Master Black Spirit actually wants to protect Jian Wushuang?”

Most of the human experts objected to battling with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor for an outsider.

Nevertheless, Temple Master Black Spirit insisted.

“It seems that Temple Master Black Spirit has made up her mind. It’s useless to persuade her. We have to hope that Jian Wushuang will be reasonable and hand over the compass.”

“The compass is useless to him. He should know what to do.”

“Whatever he does, I don’t want to have a big fight with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor. Our Monster-exterminating League can’t afford it.”

The human experts were discussing it in secret.

In the sky, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor directly spoke. “Fine, in that case, bring out this Sword Emperor.”

“Sword Emperor is in closed-door cultivation. I’ve already sent a message to him. He’ll immediately come out after he finishes his cultivation.” Temple Master Black Spirit responded.

“You mean I have to wait for him?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s face fell.

“Right.” Temple Master Black Spirit nodded.

A surge of killing intent flashed through Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s eyes. He was simmering with rage, but he choked it back. “Fine, I’m here waiting for him, but my patience is limited. I only give him one day. If I haven’t seen him within a day, I’ll make a move without hesitation.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor snorted and closed his eyes before he finished his words. He started waiting.

Calm was restored to the area, but quite a few human experts were whispering.

“Sword Emperor is really being honored here. The whole Monster-exterminating League and Crystal-armored Monster Emperor are waiting for him.”

“Where is Sword Emperor? Is he really in closed-door cultivation?”

“I heard that he went to the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace not long ago. He should be staying there.”

“The fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace. Aren’t only Temple Masters qualified to go there?

“It’s said that Temple Master Black Spirit ordered to allow him to enter the fifth floor.”

“Temple Master Black Spirit allowed Sword Emperor to go to the fifth floor and is now standing up for him. She is being too partial towards him.”

“Who knows? Temple Master Black Spirit is the pillar of our human population. She is the reason we’ve been able to survive until now and occupy 10 percent of the territory. So what if she is partial to him?”

While the human camp and the Demonic Beasts quietly waited, Jian Wushuang was busy receiving the information from the broken scarlet finger. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Eventually, the information transmission finished.

As of now, Jian Wushuang had completely inherited the Immortality Secret Skill, from Chapter One to Chapter Four.

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief, then opened his eyes and felt something unusual.

“Immortality Secret Skill, how terrifying!”

He was so shocked that it took him a while to calm down.

The Immortality Secret Skill was too powerful.

This Secret Skill was targeted towards the body. The Bone Fusion Technique which spread through the human population was actually derived from the Immortality Secret Skill.

The Bone Fusion Technique was just the basics of the Immortality Secret Skill. The remaining three chapters—Blood Condensation Technique, Armor Technique, and Divine Body Technique, were really powerful.

No one had mastered Level 12 of the Bone Fusion Technique in the entire Monster Continent. Even Temple Master Black Spirit, the number one expert in the Monster-exterminating League, had only reached Level 11.

It was so hard to master the Bone Fusion Technique, so the rest of the technique was...

”?This Secret Skill is beyond my understanding. I wonder if I’ll have an opportunity to practice the other three techniques,?” Jian Wushuang thought.

He had just reached Level 10 of the Bone Fusion Technique and was far from reaching Level 11 or 12, so it would be an extravagant hope for him to practice the Blood Condensation Technique.

While Jian Wushuang was deep in thought, the broken finger’s domineering voice echoed out once again. “Little boy, you have a great body, so I’ll give you an Enhanced Magic Thunderbolt. I hope you will be able to master the Blood Condensation Technique quickly and come to my world.”

A Scarlet Thunderbolt streaked out from the broken finger and moved towards the young man.

It moved so fast that Jian Wushuang had no chance to dodge it. In the blink of an eye, it had landed on his body.

Jian Wushuang felt his body tingle when the Scarlet Thunderbolt touched his skin, after which it immediately spread out before entering his body through his pores.

Buzz... Jian Wushuang started to shiver as the sense of electric shock spread through his body.

It was fantastic and refreshing.

Jian Wushuang felt his body improving at an amazing speed under the influence of the Scarlet Thunderbolt.

His skin, muscles, blood, bones, and organs were being upgraded with the help of this thunderbolt.

“I, I’m...”

Jian Wushuang was completely dumbfounded.

He was frightened because the speed of improvement was terrifying.

Owing to the Heavenly Creation Skill, his body had been growing stronger and stronger, but the process was slow. Now, aided by the Scarlet Thunderbolt, his improvement was countless times faster than before.
