“Space-time sand?”

Ba Cang looked at the ‘sand’ that Chen Yang Master had taken out, and a strange look flashed across his eyes. “Chen Yang, you’re quite willing to part with it. If this space-time sand were to be sold on the market, it could be sold for seven to eight billion holy elixirs. If you’re lucky, it could even be sold for ten billion holy elixirs, but you actually took it out so casually.”

“Haha, it’s just a small thing. It’s not worth mentioning.” Master Chen Yang laughed heartily.

Jian Wushuang was a little dumbfounded at this moment.

He looked at the strange ‘sand’ in front of him, somewhat at a loss.

This sand was worth 10 billion holy elixirs?

Moreover, he had never seen Master Chen Yang before, right?

This was only their first meeting. Since they had just met, Master Chen Yang had given him such a valuable treasure as a gift?

Even a Principles Master would not be so rich?

“Little guy, this is a small gift from Chen Yang. Please accept it,” Ba Cang said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jian Wushuang did not reject Ba Cang’s offer. “Thank you, Mr. Chen Yang.”

“Don’t call me Mr. Chen Yang. If you don’t mind, you can call me Brother Chen Yang from now on. I have something to do, so I’ll leave first. Next time, I’ll have a drink with you,” Master Chen Yang said, then he flew to the side.

After Master Chen Yang left…

“Chen Yang is a good man.” Ba Cang curled his lips.

“Master Ba Cang, how can Mr. Chen Yang be so generous?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Generous? He is not so generous to others, but you are different,” Ba Cang said, “I’ve just said that you have cultivated the spacetime divine skill. In the Temporal Temple, anyone who is qualified to cultivate the spacetime divine skill is destined to have a super talent in the spacetime Dao. With the careful cultivation of our Temporal Temple, such a genius is more than 90% likely to become a top expert in the future and definitely stronger than him!”

“Because of this, he has the opportunity to befriend you. He will give you the spacetime sand as a gift so that you will remember this favor. In the future, when you grow up, if he encounters any trouble and asks for your help, I’m afraid you won’t be able to refuse!

“Even if you take ten thousand steps back, if you don’t live up to your expectations and fail to become a top expert in the future, or if you die halfway, he will only waste a piece of spacetime sand. A piece of spacetime sand is nothing to a Principles Master like him who is proficient in the principles of spacetime.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood, but then he asked, “Master Ba Cang, you just said that in the Temporal Temple, everyone who has cultivated the space-time divine skill is extremely talented and has great potential. Don’t tell me that most of the experts in the Temporal Temple have never cultivated this divine skill?”

“Of course.” Ba Cang nodded. “Although the Temporal Divine Palace is one of the three major free alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm, it is different from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect. There are very few cultivators in the Temporal Divine Palace. Not to mention the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, there are more cultivators in any force or sect in the Divine Beginning Realm than in the time and space divine palace. However, our Temporal Divine Palace focuses on the quality of the cultivators and does not care about the quantity. Therefore, even if you go to the space-time island, you will not see many cultivators.”

“Among the many cultivators under the command of the Temporal Temple, there are only 20 or so who have the ability to cultivate the temporal divine skill.”

“There are only 20 or so people in the entire Temporal Temple who have cultivated the temporal divine skill?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Well, let’s not talk about this. Let’s go. Temple Master Bai Xing has been waiting for a long time,” Ba Cang said.

“Temple Master White Star?” Jian Wushuang repeated the name.

Under the guidance of Ba Cang, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at a courtyard. Beside the lake in the middle of the courtyard, a red-clothed woman was quietly fishing.

When Ba Cang and Jian Wushuang arrived at the courtyard, the lake was still calm and without any ripples.

“Temple Master White Star, I have brought this little guy here,” Ba Cang said in a loud voice.

The red-clothed woman who was sitting quietly turned her head slowly and a beautiful face appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

This face was not only beautiful but also extremely noble. It was as if it did not exist in the mortal world, making one’s heart waver.

“Little guy, let me introduce you. This is Temple Master Bai Xing. Temple Master Bai Xing is the Deputy Temple Master of our Temporal Temple. As for Temple Master, he has been wandering in the universe battlefield for a long time and has not shown his face for a long time. When Temple Master is not around, Temple Master Bai Xing is usually in charge of many things in the Temporal Temple,” Ba Cang said.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, greetings, Temple Master Bai Xing.” Jian Wushuang immediately bowed respectfully.

“Little one, welcome to the time-space island.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled at Jian Wushuang. At the same time, she put down the fishing rod in her hand, stood up slowly, and walked toward Jian Wushuang, she did not stop until she was less than a meter away from Jian Wushuang.

Temple Master Bai Xing stared at Jian Wushuang with her gem-like eyes. “I’ve seen your mirror image. You killed a rank seven True Saint with your rank four True Saint Realm cultivation. Your talent is amazing. I’ve never seen it in the history of our Temporal Temple.”

“I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang said humbly.

“Maybe.” Temple Master Bai Xing raised her eyebrows and asked, “How did you master the spacetime divine skill of our Temporal Temple?”

“Through it.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out a strange gold stone.

At first glance, this gold stone looked no different from an ordinary gold stone. However, when they saw this gold stone, temple master Bai Xing and Ba Cang’s pupils shrank.

“Space-time gold stone!”

“This is the space-time gold stone left by Temple Master himself!”

Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang with sparkling eyes. “Little guy, it seems that I have underestimated your talent in spacetime principles. The Temple Master personally refined this spacetime gold stone. Back then, the Temple Master had refined three such gold stones. He originally wanted to use these three gold stones to select disciples, but because no one had been able to comprehend the spacetime divine skill through these gold stones for a long time, he gave up.”

“After so many years, these three gold stones have long been lost in the Divine Beginning Realm. I didn’t expect that you could actually get one. Moreover, you were able to comprehend the space-time divine technique inside through this gold stone. It’s truly amazing!”

“It’s a pity that Lord Palace Master has always been in the universe battlefield, and he gave up the idea of using this gold stone to take in a disciple a long time ago. Otherwise, if he knew that you had comprehended the space-time divine technique inside through the space-time gold stone, he might really take you in as a disciple.”
