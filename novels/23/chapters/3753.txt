Chapter 3755: Danger

“How is this possible?”

“How can this domain be so powerful?”

Pupil Master’s expression changed drastically.

He did not care too much about the domain suppression of a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure.

However, now that Mystic Light Realm and Magic Sand Realm were combined, the domain suppression effect was obviously much stronger than that of a normal Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure.

The suppression brought on by the domain was not much weaker than that of a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure.

Pupil Master’s entire body was greatly restricted, and his power was greatly reduced.

Furthermore, the suppression brought on by the domain was not only affecting his power, but his reaction speed and other aspects were also reduced by a level.

However, no matter how strong the suppression of the realm was, it did not affect his protective ability.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang moved.

Swish!

A phantom-like flowing light flashed.

Before Pupil Master could react, Jian Wushuang still appeared by his side. At the same time, the Netherworld Divine Sword had already swept toward him.

“What?” Pupil Master was shocked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It was too fast. Pupil Master did not manage to catch Jian Wushuang’s figure at all. The cold Netherworld Divine Sword had already struck his body.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding rang out, and Pupil Master’s body trembled slightly.

This was a direct attack on his divine body. Pupil Master did not use any means or attack to block it. Even though he had the Supreme True Treasure Armor to block 99% of the attack’s power…however, the last part of the power still shook his divine body, causing a trace of blood to flow from the corner of his mouth.

“Blood Sword Master is much stronger than Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master. If I can’t block his swordsmanship in time and it hits me directly, I’ll still be injured.” Pupil Master’s face darkened slightly.

He understood that although his body-protection ability was great, he could not completely ignore Jian Wushuang’s attack.

At the very least, if he did not defend against Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship and relied solely on his divine body, he would still be injured even with the protection of the Supreme True Treasure Armor.

Although the injury was very light, he would be more and more seriously injured and consume more and more divine power.

“Sure enough, even if I don’t have time to use my strongest swordsmanship, I can still hurt him with my full strength, even if I use my swordsmanship casually.” Jian Wushuang also noticed this, he could not help laughing coldly in his heart.

He did not want to kill Pupil Master quickly. As long as he could hurt him, it was enough.

Then...swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Streams of ghostly flowing light suddenly began to flicker and change in the void.

It was too fast and too strange.

Every time it flickered, it could easily appear in the void 300 meters away, as if it was moving in close proximity.

Pupil Master had released his soul power to the maximum, but he found that his soul power could not keep up with Jian Wushuang’s transformation.

“This, this...” Pupil Master’s eyes widened in shock.

However, Jian Wushuang had already attacked again and again.

Every time he attacked, he relied on the Mystic Light Phantom to move close to him and constantly change his position, so Pupil Master could not react in time.

Although each sword skill he displayed was not his strongest, it was extremely fast and had a strong piercing force. Pupil Master could not defend in time.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

One after another, the sound of metal colliding could be heard.

Pupil Master had become a living target, surrounded by Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship that came from all directions.

The sword lights were almost unimpeded as they struck Pupil Master head-on.

In a short while, Pupil Master had withstood Jian Wushuang’s dozens of sword lights.

“It’s too terrifying. His movement technique is too terrifying!”

“I can’t block it. I have no time to use my staff technique to block it!”

Pupil Master was shocked.

At first, he was not anxious at all. He thought that Jian Wushuang would not be able to kill him. Even if he joined hands with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, he would at most be able to trample him.

But now, under the pressure of the terrifying domain, Jian Wushuang’s terrifying movement technique left him with no choice but to stare blankly at Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

He was like a living target. No matter how Jian Wushuang attacked, he had no room to resist or resist.

Under such crazy attacks, even with the protection of the Supreme Treasure Armor, each of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship could only cause limited damage to his divine body. Naturally, he did not care about one or two attacks, however, after dozens or even dozens of such attacks, the damage to his divine body would increase, and his divine power would be slowly consumed.

The most terrifying thing was that he was completely helpless against Jian Wushuang’s attack.

He had tried his best to block Jian Wushuang’s attack, but it was useless.

He did not even touch the corner of Jian Wushuang’s clothes. He could not react to Jian Wushuang’s attack at all.

“How could this be?”

“How could the Blood Sword Master have such incredible movement skills?”

“We’re in big trouble!”

Pupil Master finally became anxious.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master’s eyes lit up when they saw this scene.

“I didn’t expect my little friend, the Heavenly Marquis, to have mastered such a terrifying movement technique. No wonder, no wonder he has such a high chance of killing Pupil Master.” The Temporal Temple Master was excited.

“This movement technique changes time and time again, just like Temporal teleportation. Moreover, it changes directions in an instant and appears in every corner. Such a movement technique is indeed terrifying.” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master was also secretly amazed. “As far as I know, Heavenly Sword Marquis has never mastered such a movement technique before. Could it be because of the strongest Flight Type True Treasure?”

Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master could not help but look at the pair of black wings on Jian Wushuang’s back.

At this moment, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master had completely stopped and allowed Jian Wushuang to deal with Pupil Master.

Under the watchful eyes of Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master, Pupil Master was completely unable to withstand Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship. His divine body was damaged time and time again, and his divine power was constantly being depleted. Before long, Pupil Master’s divine power had been depleted by more than 10%, naturally, his aura had weakened a lot.

“There’s hope.”

“If this continues, Pupil Master’s divine power will be exhausted in at most 15 minutes. By then, he’ll definitely die!”

The eyes of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master lit up.

At this moment, they indeed saw hope in Jian Wushuang to kill Pupil Master.

Pupil Master was very clear about the current situation. At the same time, he knew that if this continued, he would really be in danger.
