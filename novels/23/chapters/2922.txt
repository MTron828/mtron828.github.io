Chapter 2923: The Sage Realm Master Has Arrived

——

“The Sage Realm Master has personally arrived!”

Even this hazy figure, a dignified Master of Laws, was utterly stunned at this moment.

Previously, it was the will of the Heavenly Dao that had descended. Still, now, a dignified Sage Realm Master, the strongest existence in the absolute beginning divine realm, had personally arrived.

“That’s not right. No matter what, this place is outside the third Heaven. In the endless territories, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao isn’t too oppressive here. Although a Sage Realm Master is formidable, he is far away in the third Heaven and is still at the core. He can’t rush here so easily. Even if he has the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao to help him, he wouldn’t be able to do so.”

“Then he must be a consciousness clone.” The shadowy figure thought to herself.

She was right. The white-robed bald man was indeed a consciousness clone, but it was much stronger than the one she had condensed as a rule master.

After the white-robed bald man walked out of the tunnel, he looked down with a gentle gaze.

“I’m late. Did he escape again?”

The white-robed bald man had already received the message from the power of the will of Heaven. He knew that Jian Wushuang had been rescued. Although he was a little angry, he was still smiling on the surface, giving off the feeling of a spring breeze.

At the same time, the white-robed bald man also noticed the hazy figure, and his eyes had already penetrated through it.

The blurry figure’s heart skipped a beat, but he immediately bowed and greeted, “Grand Supreme Emotion Valley’s Zhu Xin greets you, sir.”

“Why would someone from Grand Supreme Emotion Valley appear here?” The white-robed bald man asked.

“It’s like this. A disciple of my Grand Supreme Emotion Valley has met with some trouble here, and I’ve come specially to pick her up,” the blurry figure said.

“The disciple you’re talking about is that woman?” The white-robed bald man had already turned to look at Leng Rushuang.

“Yes.” The blurry figure did not dare to lie.

“This woman is not ordinary. If I’m not wrong, the little fellow who escaped earlier, who the Heavenly Dao does not tolerate, must be related to her.” The white-robed bald man’s eyes flickered with a strange light.

The blurry figure was startled. Although she could sense that the white-robed bald man’s tone was somewhat unfriendly, he immediately said, “Sir, this girl is a disciple of my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley and is especially important to my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. But, most importantly, my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley’s Master thinks highly of her and has even intended to accept her as a disciple.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Old Valley Master? That old woman…” The white-robed bald man did not show any signs of anger on the surface, but his heart sank.

The Supreme Emotion Valley was indeed a large force in the absolute beginning divine realm. It could even be compared to the eight directions heavenly sect.

If that were all, he would not take it to heart.

However, the Supreme Emotion Valley’s Master had to make him pay attention to her.

“Forget it. Since he is the successor of that old woman, I will naturally not make things difficult for him.” The white-robed bald man waved his hand.

“Thank you, Milord.” The hazy figure secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, the white-robed bald man had already turned around, and a terrifying aura was spreading out from his body.

The power of the will of the Heavenly Dao above the void had yet to dissipate. At this moment, the white-robed bald man seemed to have wholly combined with the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao. With the help of the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao… The white-robed bald man began to set up some unique arrays.

“What is he planning?” The hazy figure was shocked when he saw this, but he soon understood.

“He is setting up a spatial tunnel, and with the help of the will of the Heavenly Dao, could it be that he is planning to open up a spatial tunnel leading to the third heaven, allowing his true body to descend from the core of the third heaven personally?”

The hazy figure was amazed at it.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, many experts were also looking at the scene at the top of the void in shock, but no one dared to stop him.

…

This was a boundless void that was a certain distance away from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, and even the Golden Crow Nine Realms.

This void has initially been empty.

But suddenly, a figure appeared without any warning.

This figure was naturally Jian Wushuang.

He had once obtained a unique jade slip in the secret realm left behind by the Rule Master of the Pill Sun Sacred World. The jade slip contained teleportation.

Teleportation was one of the skills that could only be mastered after one had reached an extremely high level of understanding of the space-time rules.

Among the Immortal Saints, anyone who could control teleportation was the best Immortal Saint.

This time, he directly used the jade slip and teleported into the void.

Jian Wushuang did not know how far he had teleported and where he would be teleported to. However, in the situation just now, he had no choice but to use teleportation to escape.

After appearing in the void, Jian Wushuang’s aura immediately became weak.

Not only was he weak, but he was also very weak.

The heaven-cleaving skill was the most powerful divine power created by his Master Xuan Yi. It was extremely powerful. Although he could not exert one-tenth of its power, it was still too much of a burden for him to use it. Moreover, he had just used it twice.

His divine power and mind had been extensively damaged after using it twice.

He had indeed fallen into a weakened state.

This was the first time he had encountered such a weakness since his reincarnation.

However, Jian Wushuang could not care less at this moment. His expression was cold and his mind was full of thoughts.

“I unscrupulously displayed the power of the life-level and performed the heaven-cleaving skill twice in a row. The power of the will of Heaven has already arrived. The power of the will of Heaven has completely locked onto my position. Although Daoist Xuan Shen helped me out of my predicament in time and allowed me to teleport away, now that my position has been exposed, the power of the will of Heaven, as well as the mortal enemies of the seven-star mysterious sect in the core of the divine beginning world, the three masters of the saint realm, will immediately rush over.

“Even if their original bodies won’t come in person, their consciousness doppelgangers will definitely come. When that time comes, they will definitely try to find my whereabouts. They will definitely turn the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and even the surrounding territories upside down!”

“I definitely can’t go back to the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Not only that, all the people who are close to me in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow must be moved immediately!”

Jian Wushuang was very clear about the danger he was facing.

Not only would he face great danger, but he would also implicate the people around him.

For example, his parents in this life!
