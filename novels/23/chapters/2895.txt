Chapter 2896: Jian Yi Arrived

——

As Yin Su’er had said, the Old Dragon God was very friendly to Jian Wushuang. When he knew that Jian Wushuang was here to borrow the path, he agreed without hesitation.

Since then, the matter of borrowing the path had been completed, and the next step was to flatten the Heaven Curve World.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived in the Heaven Curve World.

…

The Heaven Curve World was originally the supreme realm of the World Master, and all the forces had submitted to him.

His Heaven Curve Palace was also the indisputable habitat of the Heaven Curve World.

However, since the news spread that the World Master was killed by Jian Wushuang, the Heaven Curve World immediately faced the same situation as the Pill Sun Sacred World.

A lot of disputes began to appear. The Heaven Curve Palace could no longer keep its word like before. There were even factions fighting among themselves.

In short, the Heaven Curve World was now very chaotic.

In a grand hall in the Heaven Curve Palace, dozens of figures gathered together. They were all-powerful Great Divine Masters. The leader of them was a brown-haired man, this brown-haired man was none other than the second unrivaled Divine Master in the Heaven Curve World apart from the Black Blood Emperor, Divine Master Blood Lamp!

“Chaos, chaos, the entire Heaven Curve World is in chaos now.”

“Our Heaven Curve World’s territory is extremely vast and there are many experts. These experts have formed many major powers and their foundations are all extraordinary. Previously, when the Realm Lord was here, none of these powers dared to disobey his orders. But now that the Realm Lord has died, these major powers immediately began to have their own intentions!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Not to mention these big forces, even the people from the Deacons Hall, the Heaven Pavilion, and the Heaven Curve Army in our Heaven Curve Palace are doing something. Even Lord Blood Lamp’s orders are ignored.”

Many Great Divine Masters were discussing, but none of them looked good.

“Alright, shut up.”

Blood Lamp Divine Master finally spoke. As soon as he spoke, everyone in the hall immediately quieted down.

Blood Lamp Divine Master fell silent for a moment before he finally spoke, “It has been so many years since the establishment of the Heavenly Curve World. The Realm Lord has always revered the Heavenly Curve World. Now that the Realm Lord has suddenly fallen, it is inevitable that there would be some commotion. Now, we have no way to complain about this. Instead, we should think of ways to deal with the current situation!”

“And there’s only one way to calm the chaos in the Heavenly Curve World. That is to use a powerful method to intimidate the various powers and calm them down, just like how the Realm Lord did before. But such a person…”

Blood Lamp could not help but frown.

What he said was indeed the best method. But there was not anyone in the Heavenly Curve World who could make the experts of the various powers in the Heavenly Curve World not dare to act rashly.

He was the strongest person in the Heavenly Curve World in terms of personal strength.

However, he was only an Invincible Divine Master in the first stage. In terms of combat strength, he was weaker than the Marquis of Three Yin, who had fought with Jian Wushuang before. Although he was stronger than the Peak Divine Masters, the experts in the Heavenly Curve World were as numerous as the clouds, there were several powerful Peak Divine Masters. Any two or three of them working together would be enough to fight against him.

With his strength alone, he’s no threat to the world.

“Damn it, it’s fine if the Realm Lord died, but even the Black Blood Emperor is dead. Otherwise, with the Black Blood Emperor’s strength, if he joined forces with me, it would be enough to make the various powers in the Heavenly Curve World not dare to act Rashly.” The Blood Lamp Divine Master cursed in his heart.

The Black Blood Emperor is the second stage of the Invincible Divine Master, the combat strength is much stronger than him.

The two unrivaled reverent gods working together were enough to sweep through all the forces of the Heavenly Curve World.

But the crux of the matter was that the Black Blood Emperor had also fallen.

And just as Blood Lamp reverent god and the others were frowning…

Whoosh!

A figure appeared in the hall without any warning.

“Everyone, is there anything I can help you with?”

A faint smile with a hint of mockery reverberated in the hall.

All the experts in the hall immediately turned to look at the newcomer.

Everyone was shocked when they saw him.

“You are… Jian Yi!” Divine master Blood Lamp stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Yi?

The moment the name was uttered, the entire hall burst into an uproar.

The Great Divine Masters in the hall immediately distanced themselves from Jian Wushuang and stared at him with fear and vigilance. A few of them even took out their magic weapons on the spot.

“What’s wrong? Do you want to fight me?” Jian Wushuang crossed his arms and glanced at the Great Divine Masters who took out their magic weapons.

The Great Divine Masters were shocked and their hearts could not help trembling.

“Put them away,” Divine Master Blood Lamp shouted.

The Great Divine Masters immediately put their magic weapons back into their interspatial rings.

Divine Master Blood Lamp looked at Jian Wushuang and took a deep breath. After a long while, he said, “May I know why sir Jian Yi has come to our Heavenly Curve Palace?”

Although they were both Divine Masters, Divine Master Blood Lamp was still a genuine Invincible Divine Master.

However, when he faced Jian Wushuang, he had to respectfully address him as ‘sir’. That was the difference between them.

“I came here for two reasons.” Jian Wushuang extended two fingers. “First, from today onward, the Heavenly Curve World will respect me. Experts from all forces in the Heavenly Curve World must submit to me. Those who refuse to submit will be killed without mercy!”

Everyone in the hall was stunned, but no one dared to object.

They did not have the courage to fight against Jian Wushuang, who could directly kill Realm Master Tian Qu.

As for avenging Realm Master Tian Qu… they did not have the slightest intention to do so.

After all, they were only the subordinates of Realm Master Tian Qu, and because Realm Master Tian Qu was too aloof, they did not have a deep relationship with him.

In addition, now that the Heavenly Curve World was in chaos, someone needed to calm it down. Divine Master Blood Lamp was not qualified, but Jian Wushuang definitely had the ability to do so.

“Secondly, I once created a force called the Sword Alliance in the Pill Sun Sacred World. It won’t be long before the Sword Alliance is transferred to the Heavenly Curve World. By then, the Sword Alliance will be supreme in the Heavenly Curve World, and Heavenly Curve Palace will cease to exist.”

“As for you, if you are willing, you can join the Sword Alliance. I can guarantee that you will have a place in the Sword Alliance in the future. If you are not willing, you can leave. But I don’t want any of you to mention Heavenly Curve Palace in the future,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Hearing this, the Great Divine Masters in the hall looked at each other with mixed feelings.

But at the same time, no one dared to go against Jian Wushuang’s words.
