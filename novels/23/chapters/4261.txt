4262 A Battle Bet

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave.

“I heard you’re only a fifth stage Ruler, Blood Sword?” A bald man walked out of the crowd and looked down at Jian Wushuang with his chin.

Jian Wushuang stopped and turned back to look at the bald man. He said indifferently, “That’s right. I’m only a fifth stage great Ruler. But so what?”

The moment he finished speaking.

The crowd burst into laughter.

“Hahahaha, a mere fifth-stage chief Ruler wants to command us ultimate chief Rulers? What a joke.”

“A fifth-stage chief Ruler? I can kill a group of them with a single slap!”

“Hmph, if word of us being led by a mere fifth stage great Ruler like you were to spread, wouldn’t we become a laughing stock?”

The Ultimate Rulers all laughed coldly.

When the ten Ultimate Rulers, led by Commander Mountain Shaker, saw this, their faces filled with anger.

They were very grateful to Jian Wushuang. They knew that if it were not for Jian Wushuang, they would not even be able to stand here, let alone get the God Sealing Tablet.

“What are you guys talking about? Lord Blood Sword might only be a fifth stage Ruler, but his battle-power was definitely at the peak of Rulers! Ceng Sanjian killed Cang Feng, who was nearly invincible!” One of the ten Ultimate Rulers immediately retorted.

However, this person’s voice was too small and was quickly drowned out by the loud laughter.

“A fifth-stage chief Ruler killed a chief Ruler who was almost invincible? You believe such a ridiculous joke?”

The bald man looked at the ten angry Ultimate Rulers with disdain. Then, he looked straight at Jian Wushuang and sized him up. He sneered, “If this Blood Sword really had such battle power, it would’ve been famous in the universe long ago. The way I see it, this is a trap set up by the other camps to target our Lord Overlord. They deliberately put on such a show so that Blood Sword can enter the Overlord’s camp and be entrusted with an important task.”

“Shut up! When Lord Blood Sword killed Cang Feng, we all saw it with our own eyes!” The Ultimate Ruler did not wait for him to finish speaking. His face was cold.

When the bald man heard this, he immediately curled his lips and replied indifferently, “Who knows if you guys have already been assimilated by the other factions?”

As soon as he said this, the ten Ultimate Rulers led by Commander Mountain Shaker changed their expressions.

The entire place was so silent that even a pin drop could be heard.

The power of these words was too great. It was almost as if they were saying that the ten of them were spies sent by the subordinates of other big shots.

Seeing this, the bald man felt that he had made a mistake and said again, “Of course, I was just casually saying it. I didn’t mean to target you.”

As for the ten Ultimate Rulers, they could not hold back any longer. In an instant, their divine power began to surge.

For a moment, the atmosphere at the scene was tense and dangerous.

Jian Wushuang looked at the scene and frowned.

Now that he was about to leave, he did not want to get involved too much. He turned a blind eye to these sixty Ultimate Rulers who had been assigned to him. As long as these people did not go too far, he would listen.

However, this did not mean that Jian Wushuang was weak and easily bullied!

It did not mean that Jian Wushuang would allow others to challenge his dignity!

“What’s your name?” Jian Wushuang looked at the bald man and said expressionlessly.

The bald man did not show any fear on his face. He stuck out his chest and sneered, “I never change my name. You can just call me Divine Lord Xue Peng!”

“Divine Lord Xue Peng?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “Since you’re not convinced that I’m able to take the commander’s position, why don’t we have a battle?”

“Oh? You want to bet with me?” Divine Lord Xue Peng raised his eyebrows when he heard that. He then laughed and said jokingly, “Little fellow, how do you want to bet with me?”

“It’s simple. I’ll only use one finger. If you can take it, you’ll be the commander from now on. I, Blood Sword, will follow your orders without any objections.” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang’s voice suddenly turned cold.

“If you can’t take it, then…I will take your life!”

When he said that, Jian Wushuang had already exerted some pressure. In an instant, Divine Lord Xue Peng’s heart turned cold and he had the illusion that he wanted to kneel down and submit.

After taking a deep breath, Divine Lord Xue Peng made up his mind and sneered, “You’re just a mere fifth stage great Ruler, why wouldn’t I dare?”

After hearing that, Jian Wushuang remained expressionless while the ten Ultimate Rulers brought by Commander Mountain Shaker had already mourned for Divine Lord Xue Peng in their hearts.

They looked at each other and could see the joy in each other’s eyes.

It was obvious that they had hated Divine Lord Xue Peng to the core!

“Then let’s start.”

Jian Wushuang was expressionless. He raised his finger and pressed it between Divine Lord Xue Peng’s eyebrows.

Sharp sword Qi began to gather at Jian Wushuang’s fingertips.

“Returning shield!”

Although Divine Lord Xue Peng looked reckless and rude, he did not really look down on Jian Wushuang as he appeared to be. He quickly took out a top grade defense law Cardinal treasure from his Interspatial Ring. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Streams of sword Qi gathered on Jian Wushuang’s fingertips and the entire governor’s manor started to tremble.

It was as if a storm of sword Qi had formed at his fingertips!

At that moment, the expressions of the many Ultimate Rulers present changed drastically. They could clearly feel the terrifying power contained in Jian Wushuang’s fingertips!

This finger was enough to blow up a planet!

“Retreat!”

“Retreat!” The dozens of Ultimate Rulers immediately growled and retreated!

As for Divine Lord Xue Peng, who had been targeted by Jian Wushuang’s finger, his expression turned pale and beads of sweat the size of beans appeared on his forehead.

He gritted his teeth and stared at Jian Wushuang’s finger that was getting closer and closer to him. He trembled in fear.

He wanted to escape with those Ultimate Rulers, but he felt an invisible and extremely powerful aura suppressing him, making him unable to move at all!

“What…how could this be?” Divine Lord Xue Peng said in disbelief.

Gradually, the finger pressed on the shield of returning origin that was in front of him.

Kacha!

Without any resistance, the origin returning shield, which was known for its strong defense, cracked and finally fell apart with a bang!

The next moment!

The finger kept enlarging in Divine Lord Xue Peng’s eyes. It grew bigger and bigger…

In the end, the finger landed on his forehead!
