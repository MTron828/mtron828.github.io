Chapter 5446 ¬†You Won

The physical body can integrate with exotic treasures, rivaling Eternal Treasures, and persist indefinitely.

The Origin Source is a type of substance in the universe; no matter how powerful it is, after falling, the Origin Source returns to the universe and does not dissipate. What disappears is either swallowed by someone like Jian Wushuang or suppressed.

Grandmaster also withdrew his supernatural powers and looked at Jian Wushuang, saying, "You've won!"

Indeed, it could be considered that Jian Wushuang had won.

In the end, he used a treasure for that move.

His battle with Jian Wushuang was temporary and had no clear rules.

He could even let it slide.

"I won!" Jian Wushuang was somewhat puzzled.

Grandmaster calmly said, "Yes, you won. You've won against me now. Consider it passing the final test. Be prepared for the next inheritance; it may exceed your imagination!"

Be prepared.

A strange smile appeared on Jian Wushuang's face.

It wasn't easy to surpass his imagination.

Now he possessed the Beast God Weapon, even though it was incomplete. Inside the Qishen Temple, refining a semi-finished product was not a problem. He also mastered the Extreme Dao, a transcendent Origin Source, surpassing all inheritances.

As for the rest, just these two things alone were beyond compare.

As for experience, he had stepped through the starry sky, living for billions of years, witnessing countless miraculous scenes.

The origin of life on a star, the birth and propagation of civilizations, the structure of the cosmos.

All of this was the most valuable experience.

It's not that he looked down on the First True King, but compared to the Qishen Temple, the Three King Courts were lacking.

At least, the gap in grandeur was significant, and the outcome was even more absurd.

The Three Kings were suppressed by Fuego, and if the Qishen Temple hadn't intervened, this relic might not have been left behind.

Originally, he had high hopes for the Three King Courts, but upon entering, he found it too crude.

He wanted to see what kind of inheritance it was‚Äîperhaps it could produce a complete universe Origin Source?

If that were the case, he would truly respect this True King.

Grandmaster raised his hand, slowly manipulating his fingers, and in the palm of his hand, there was a miniature chessboard.

"Do you know what levels of treasures exist above the Eternal Treasure?" The First True King's gaze was somewhat fervent. This was the glory of his lifetime.

Jian Wushuang was a bit puzzled. How did they suddenly start talking about treasures?

Above the Eternal Treasure, there was the Universe Treasure, and he knew this because Shan Jun had informed him.

However, the Universe Treasure could only be used when the Origin Source reached the universe or cosmic realm, making it useless for them.

When the Spatial Origin Source reached the universe realm, it was almost becoming the Universe Master itself.

The Universe Treasure was primarily used by the Universe Master, providing little assistance to Emperors.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang didn't have much knowledge about it.

As for treasures more powerful than the Universe Treasure, he was unaware.

According to the old man with the goat horns, the Beast God Weapon was only special, slightly stronger than ordinary Universe Treasures, but fundamentally, it was still on the level of Universe Treasures.

As for Grandmaster's question, Jian Wushuang shook his head, not knowing the answer.

Looking at the chessboard in the other's hand, he felt a sinking feeling in his heart. Could this chessboard be more powerful than the Universe Treasure?

Swish!

"Come in and take a look! Let me show you a treasure more powerful than the Universe Treasure!" Grandmaster led Jian Wushuang into the central part of the chessboard, into a river.

Inside the river, there was a huge rock with a small pavilion on top. Inside the pavilion, there were no seats, and the two stood there.

Jian Wushuang gazed at the rushing river, where the power of spatial turbulence and time flowed. This was the River of Time and Space!

On a treasure, there was actually an entire River of Time and Space!

Although it was a scaled-down version, it still left Jian Wushuang in awe. He had never seen a real River of Time and Space; he had only glimpsed it through some Inheritors.

The most direct experience was seeing those Rivers of Time and Space in the starry sky, but they were too far away, resembling veins of blood.

"Something even more powerful than the Universe Treasure is the Temporal Treasure, the chessboard we are currently on!" Grandmaster looked somewhat triumphant.

Seeing Jian Wushuang's expression quiver, he continued, "I can tell you clearly, in the Moro Temporal era, this treasure could easily rank in the top three, perhaps even the top two. The Temporal Treasure is too formidable; even the Universe Master wouldn't bring it out casually. Only two have truly appeared‚Äîone in the hands of Qishen and the other in the possession of a formidable figure no less than Qishen!"

Qishen possessed only one!

Jian Wushuang was shocked and pale. Did that mean Qishen coveted this treasure immensely?

"Elder, is the treausre in Qishen's possession a temple-type treasure?" Jian Wushuang inquired with curiosity. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

Qishen Temple was quite unique, and if the Temporal Treasure in Qishen's hands wasn't the temple, it meant Qishen possessed another Temporal Treasure.

Grandmaster hesitated for a moment before replying, "The Qishen Temple?"

He genuinely had no idea. Although he had deduced that someone had come to this ruin, he hadn't gone as far as to speculate it was Qishen.

Originally, he predicted the future relying on this chessboard.

Realizing the other party was unaware, Jian Wushuang quickly changed the subject, inquiring about the details of this chessboard.

Temporal Treasures were hard to come by.

When Grandmaster acquired this chessboard, he was still an ordinary mortal. It happened in the mortal world while he was playing chess with an old man for ten days and nights without rest. Eventually, he won the game and gained possession of the chessboard.

A gleam appeared in Grandmaster's eyes, and his voice trembled, "From the mortal world to the pinnacle of the Immortal realm, I have never seen that senior again. He is the true powerhouse; we are nothing more than ants!"

Indeed!

Giving such a powerful Temporal Treasure directly to a mortal was simply extravagant.

How formidable must that person be?

At the very least, the Universe Master wouldn't casually bestow a Universe Treasure upon a mortal.

At most, they might offer an Eternal Treasure that one could refine, which wouldn't be considered precious to a Universe Master.

The ability to casually produce a Temporal Treasure implies tremendous courage and strength on the part of the other party.

Even Xuan Yi wasn't this generous back then!

"Did that senior leave behind any title or name?" Jian Wushuang asked cautiously.

He had a premonition that Grandmaster would give him this treasure; otherwise, there would be no need for such a challenging trial.

The First True King hesitated for a moment, unsure whether to disclose the information. However, since he had already fallen and had nothing to lose, he spoke up:

"Just a worldly name, I'm not sure if it's true or false!"

"Gu Yi!"

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly.

Gu Yi...

This name sounded so similar to Xuan Yi's.

Just one character was different.

While he was lost in thought, a dilapidated, pitch-black ancient ship drifted into the river.

Accompanying it was a peculiar wind chime sound.
