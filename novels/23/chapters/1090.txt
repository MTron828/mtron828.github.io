Chapter 1091: Fast and Slow, Yin and Yang!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Per Gu King’s prediction, the four Puppet Fighters treated Jian Wushuang as an Eternal Realm expert in the beginning. However, as the battle progressed, their strength gradually enhanced until they reached the level of a Dao Master.

They went from Rank One to Rank Three, and finally to Peak of Rank Three.

Even so, it did not take Jian Wushuang much effort to deal with them.

Then, the four Puppet Fighters rose to the battle strength of an elementary Celestial Master.

It was only then that Jian Wushuang began to struggle.

Celestial Master Yu Ding, who was watching the battle attentively outside the hall, shook his head.

“It’s been an hour and the four Puppet Fighters still couldn’t defeat Jian Wushuang despite gaining the strength of a medium-level Celestial Master. Looks like he’ll be able to obtain the third Soul-luring Incense but it remains to be seen if he can obtain the fourth.” He looked forward to seeing what would happen.

The third incense could burn for a month.

The fourth was good enough to last an entire year.

Though many Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace had obtained the Soul-luring Incense, what most of them got was the second incense—the kind that burned for only a day. Few obtained the third.

“Boom!”

Inside the hall, a loud explosion reverberated as Jian Wushuang was thrown backward. He appeared to be in a very wretched state.

Yu Ding immediately looked over at him. “Did he lose?”

Jian Wushuang had indeed lost.

With the four Puppet Fighters, whose strength had reached the level of a medium Celestial Master, working together, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang to soldier on for long.

“I’ve tried my best. I wonder what kind of Soul-luring Incense I got…”

The four Puppet Fighters stopped attacking after defeating Jian Wushuang. One of them went to the censer and inserted the largest incense into it.

The incense was ignited immediately after being put into the censer.

“The fourth one!”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

“It’s really the fourth one.” Yu Ding could not help exclaiming when he saw what happened.

Obtaining the fourth Soul-luring Incense meant that Jian Wushuang could devote himself to cultivation for a whole year under the incense’s guidance. This was a great opportunity for him.

Many Celestial Masters were able to make gains after cultivating for just one day under the incense’s guidance. It would be even more effective if they spent one month cultivating, but Jian Wushuang now had a whole year to do so…

“What an enviable talent.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Shaking his head, Yu Ding turned around and left.

Just as he was turning around, the hall became completely closed-off.

The moment the incense was ignited, Jian Wushuang became the only person with the right to stay in the hall to meditate.

“Kid, this is your chance. Make full use of it,” Gu King said.

Not wanting to waste any precious time, Jian Wushuang immediately sat cross-legged and closed his eyes.

Following the burning of the incense, a faint fragrance gradually permeated the hall until it reached his nose. He felt refreshed and relaxed all at the same time.

Thus, he started to meditate.

It went without saying that he mediated using the three Sword Principles that he created.

Coalescence Sword Principle was the only one that reached the Creation Level. In order to upgrade it, he needed to integrate various Sword Principles to form an integral whole.

Though his meditation went much faster than before thanks to the incense, he could not enhance the Coalescence Sword Principle as he did not have other Sword Principle as a reference. Therefore, he chose to focus on his two other Sword Principles: Aurora Sword Principle and Scarlet Yang Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang began with Aurora Sword Principle. He could only meditate one at a time.

It was a pity that the incense was only effective on one person. Even though he had two Original Bodies, the incense was ineffective on the other one even if it had consciousness too.

“The speed of… Aurora Sword Formation?” he murmured.

He had sunk into complete silence.

In the blink of an eye, an entire month had passed.

Jian Wushuang continued sitting cross-legged inside the hall but a fresh idea was swimming in his consciousness.

The idea came from one of his memories.

It was his memory of the inauguration ceremony of the Supervisor, where his father had killed Celestial Master Lei Yi.

The idea came from his father’s sword then…

His sword was painfully slow yet this was nothing more than an illusion. It was actually unimaginably swift.

“Slow?”

“Fast or slow?”

The idea in his mind became clearer and clearer as he continued to recall the scene where his father used his swordsmanship.

“That’s it! I finally understand it!”

“No wonder I can’t advance my Sword Principle to the Creation Level no matter how hard I tried. It didn’t work even after improved its speed to its peak. So it turns out that it’s not only about being fast, but it’s also about being slow!”

“The speed includes being both fast and slow. The Aurora Sword Principle I created can only go ‘fast’, so even if it has the highest speed, it’s just part of the speed. Its power is still limited!”

“This is like a warrior of the Ancient World. No matter how strong he is, he’s still in the Ancient World and doesn’t know the vastness of the world outside. Therefore, he can never reach his peak!”

“That’s the case for my Aurora Sword Principle!”

“No matter how fast my swordsmanship is, it’s just one kind of the speed. The real philosophy of speed is that one should meditate both the way of ‘fast’ and ‘slow’, and then combine them perfectly.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted with golden light.

He had been unable to work past the bottleneck in cultivating the Aurora Sword Principle.

He now knew how to make a breakthrough.

The Aurora Sword Principle had reached the highest level and all that was left to do was for him to create a slow Sword Principle. Once he combined both in a perfect way, he would be able to create the Speed Sword Principle.

“It’s not limited to just the Aurora Sword Principle. Scarlet Yang Sword Principle works the same way,” he murmured.

The Scarlet Yang Sword Principle was the toughest and most positive of all Sword Principles. It sought the extremities.

The opposite of extreme positivity was extreme negativity!

Only by creating the Scarlet Yin Sword Principle and combining it with the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle, could one acquire the Yin-Yang Sword Principle of the Creation Level.

Having figured out this point, Jian Wushuang now had a clear idea of the reasoning behind his two Sword Principles. He continued studying them under the guidance of the Soul-luring Incense.
