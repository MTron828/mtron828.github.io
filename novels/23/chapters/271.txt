Chapter 272: Making Unfounded Charges

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“An expert of the Saint Realm!”

The robust middle-aged man, who was ready to kill Jian Wushuang with his whole strength, was surprised.

In the previous disciples gathering, the team leader of every sect was only a Half-saint expert. However, this time, the Daluo Heaven Sect had dispatched an expert of the Saint Realm to this gathering!

This expert of the Saint Realm wore a gray robe and had gray hair but was very eye catching.

“The fourth elder in the Daluo Heaven Sect, Liu Hanyue!”

“It’s him!”

The grey-robed elder was recognized by the surrounding experts from different sects.

“Hum, an expert from Wilderness Sword Sect wants to bully the juniors? Since that is the case, I also must bully?juniors today!” the grey-robed elder Liu Hanyue said coldly. Then, like a breeze blowing, his figure floated out.

“Elder Liu, this...” the robust middle-aged man, who was from the Wilderness Sword Sect, was speaking but interrupted by an incident where the space before him cracked. A hoary palm, containing vast Spiritual Power, slapped on his chest in an instant.

Although he was a Half-saint Level expert, he had absolutely no resistance when he fought with a real Saint Realm expert, especially, Liu Hanyue who had stayed at the level for more than ten years and had formed the saintly body.

Immediately he only felt that an unprecedented giant force had passed from him. His Dantian shattered and he?was crushed at this moment. Immediately he spouted a large mouthful of blood. His body was flung like a broken kite.

When he stabilized his body, his face was already pale.

“My Dantian, my Dantian!” The robust man yelled in a fury.

Liu Hanyue displayed this move with his whole strength and directly destroyed his Dantian.

“Because of the Wilderness Sword Sect sake, I have left your life. But your Wilderness Sword Sect must give me an account of what happened today.” Liu Hanyue’s voice reverberated through the whole Martial Arts Practice Field.

All experts were shocked this time.

The robust middle-aged man from the Wilderness Sword Sect looked furious.

Obviously, your disciples of the Daluo Heaven Sect killed Chen Feng. And then you destroyed the Dantian of the Half-saint expert from the Wilderness Sword Sect. But now you made unfounded claims that you should force the Wilderness Sword Sect to give you an account.

Thinking about it more, in this disciples gathering, it was normal that disciples couldn’t control themselves and couldn’t help but kill the other disciples. At the beginning, Chen Feng wanted to kill Jian Wushuang but Jian Wushuang killed him. It was not a crime.

However, a Half-saint expert from the Wilderness Sword Sect wanted to fight with Jian Wushuang. That was indeed excessive. Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had great strength. If a normal disciple fought with the Half-saint expert, the disciples would be killed directly by the robust middle-aged man.

Therefore, Liu Hanyue wanted Wilderness Sword Sect to give him an account. It was logical and reasonable.

After thinking that, those experts from different sects all understood Liu Hanyue’s request. However, the people from the Wilderness Sword Sect all gave a grievous look.

“An account?” The robust middle-aged man muffled his voice at this time. “Liu Hanyue, you are from the Daluo Heaven Sect and killed the disciple of our Wilderness Sword Sect. Besides, the disciple was the son of our Sect Master. In addition, you have destroyed my Dantian. And you want our Wilderness Sword Sect to give you an account. Hum, this is too much bad. Wait for our Wilderness Sword Sect’s account.”

“Go!”

After saying that, the people from the Wilderness Sword Sect took Chen Feng’s body and then they left.

After seeing the people?from the Wilderness Sword Sect leave, Liu Hanyue smiled coldly. He waved his hands and then the people from the Daluo Heaven Sect also left.

On the way to the Daluo Heaven Sect.

“Chen Feng was killed and one elder’s Dantian was destroyed by fourth elder. They lost a lot. However, the Daluo Heaven Sect is always overbearing, so they will counterattack,” Ling Han said with a smile.

“Thank you for today’s achievement.” Ling Han looked at Jian Wushuang.

Not only him, but also at this moment all the disciples of the Daluo Heaven Sect were looking at Jian Wushuang with veneration.

No one ever thought that the merely 21-year-old Swordsman had such great strength, although his Cultivation of Spiritual Power was only the Initial Yang Void Realm.

Chen Feng was the Peak of the Yang Void Realm at least, and he was as strong as Ye Se who was the strongest among them. However, he was killed by Jian Wushuang’s one move.

What’s more important was that Jian Wushuang did not retreat?but dashed toward the Half-saint expert from the Wilderness Sword Sect. And then the Half-saint expert retreated. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was incredible.

These events looked impossible for those disciples but Jian Wushuang had done it.

Not to mention them, even the fourth elder Liu Hanyue who was at Divine Transcendence looked at Jian Wushuang strangely.

Before he had been hiding in the dark, he saw everything, including the scene that Jian Wushuang displayed his move. The strength Jian Wushuang showed did not match with his age.

Not long after, everyone returned to the Daluo Heaven Sect. The Daluo Heaven Sect Sect Master and many elders had been waiting outside the gate.

“You are back.” Daluo Heaven Sect Master, a mighty handsome middle-aged man, smiled gently and looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Sect Master, Chen Feng was killed and the Wilderness Sword Sect Half-saint expert’s Dantian was destroyed by the fourth elder,” Ling Han directly said.

“Oh?” Daluo Heaven Sect Master lifted his brows and nodded without any surprise.

That made Ling Han surprised. Thinking about this, Sect Master had been worried about whether Jian Wushuang could kill Chen Feng before leaving. But now, Sect Master’s attitude had changed thoroughly.

“My little friend, Swordsman,” Daluo Heaven Sect Master looked atJian Wushuang and said, “I have a letter from the Alchemy School. You should read it.”

After saying this, he handed the letter to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang raised her eyebrows. After taking the letter, he opened it and skimmed it. And then Jian Wushuang laughed.

Daluo Heaven Sect Master also looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile and said, “Father and son are both exceptional geniuses and pursue?their own goals together in the Heaven and Earth! Although you are young, your strength, even in our sect, is amazing.”

“A small battle result. It’s not bad,” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and said, “Everybody, I am here because of the invitation of Alchemy School. I have completed your request. I have other things to do. Good bye.”

“Do you want to leave now?” Daluo Heaven Sect Master was slightly surprised and then he nodded. “OK. We will meet again. If you face any troubles, you can contact our Daluo Heaven Sect. We will try our best to help you.”

Jian Wushuang lifted his brow and cupped his hands before his chest. Then, he turned around and left.
