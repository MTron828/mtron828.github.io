In the past, the chances of hope seemed remote, but now they were within reach.

Nie Yuan, how could he let go of such an opportunity? He immediately agreed.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, along with City Lord Feng and others, headed towards the place where the ore was originally mined.

“This time, let’s still set a period of ten years. Every ten years, we take a break. It won’t take much time, and then we’ll be free!” City Lord Feng said with a light laugh, and everyone was very enthusiastic.

Jian Wushuang blended in and also showed a longing expression.

However, Gong Miaoyi had a trace of unease.

When she looked at Jian Wushuang, her eyes changed.

But at this moment, Jian Wushuang’s thoughts were not on Gong Miaoyi, and he didn’t notice.

Upon reaching the mine, the group began to silently extract the ore.

Gong Miaoyi found a secluded corner and worked alone.

Using the diving mining equipment, it took only a month to carve out a small hole in the stone wall.

Gong Miaoyi buried the soul flag in it.

However, in this mine, there was only one location designated by Shen Ling.

The remaining positions needed to be found elsewhere.

To avoid arousing suspicion from outsiders, Gong Miaoyi transmitted to Jian Wushuang, “I’ll go check other places. You don’t need to worry about me!”

Jian Wushuang knew her thoughts. She must be uneasy about Nie Yuan, but he didn’t suspect anything. He just nodded and reminded her to be careful.

But Gong Miaoyi felt disdain in her heart.

Now Jian Wushuang’s concern seemed disgusting to her.

There was no genuine affection; everything was calculated.

Filled with righteousness and moral principles in his words, but harboring a cunning mind.

Jian Wushuang received a message from Wu Zuo after Gong Miaoyi’s departure. Everything had been arranged on Nie Yuan’s end.

The grand drama of father-daughter reunion was about to unfold.

However, beforehand, Wu Zuo had already set up a large array through Nie Yuan, ensuring that the enforcers from the Enforcement Hall wouldn’t easily capture them.

In the upcoming confrontation, they hoped that Shen Ling would intervene; otherwise, their plan would be in jeopardy.

They had only 15 minutes.

The surveillance here consisted of only three tier 6 Emperors.

All were native Emperors with mediocre strength, and Jian Wushuang alone could handle them. As long as there was a tier 6 peak Emperor from the outside, especially one from the Elder Palace.

That Emperor would arrive within three breaths.

As for the avatars of the three Temple Masters, the one presiding over this area was Temple Master Lu Hua.

Although Jian Wushuang was now officially wanted, he wouldn’t go all out. There would certainly be some delay before Lu Hua arrived.

Moreover, since the Enforcement Hall was handling this matter, as long as it didn’t threaten the mines, they shouldn’t take action.

It was the enforcers from the Enforcement Hall who would arrive within 15 minutes.

Everything depended on this 15-minute window.

If Shen Ling were truly unprepared, they could only accept their fate, wasting their efforts when the time came.

While Jian Wushuang mined the rocks on one side, his true self projected out, using a strand of telepathic force to locate Nie Yuan.

The great battle was about to erupt.

Nie Yuan was currently searching for Gong Miaoyi.

Buzz!

It was a subtle transformation of the soul.

Another soul flag embedded into the mountain.

“Only the last one remains!” Gong Miaoyi held her breath, not daring to pause.

Even she did not hesitate to use the tier 5 peak-level Origin Source, forcibly excavating, instantly creating a small opening.

Then she placed the flag inside.

Another location!

Gong Miaoyi followed the guidance, searching.

However, she was unaware that a strand of consciousness passed by her.

At this moment, Gong Miaoyi, disregarding everything, appeared quite flustered.

Within the consciousness, Jian Wushuang’s true self observed Gong Miaoyi, a hint of unease in his heart.

Although he didn’t know what had happened, a sense of foreboding lingered in his heart.

“Never mind, it’s best if Zhen Ling comes. Even if Zhen Ling doesn’t come, she can’t stir up much trouble!” A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. This time, he had been careless.

The current situation deviated from the plan. Gong Miaoyi’s strange actions were definitely related to certain individuals.

It could be the Law Enforcement Hall, perhaps Shen Ling.

Hard to say.

Jian Wushuang manipulated his consciousness, continuing forward; he needed to find Nie Yuan.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Take the other party to meet Gong Miaoyi.

This time, he was throwing caution to the wind.

Here, sooner or later, the people from the Law Enforcement Hall would discover them. Moreover, not rescuing Nie Yuan immediately would raise Shen Ling’s suspicion.

However, he was unaware that this seemingly flawless plan was actually within the grasp of Shen Ling.

In the void, amidst silent darkness.

Crack!

A startling thunderbolt flashed, illuminating the dark crevice. In the blink of an eye, this place silently gathered tens of thousands of people.

All of them were Emperors.

And they were powerful Emperors.

All of them were tier 5 Emperors.

Thousands of tier 5 Emperors gathered, and only the Elder Palace and the White Tiger Temple had such a grand scale.

These individuals were the powerful beings arranged by Shen Ling in this place.

Now, they waited for Gong Miaoyi to set up the formation before launching an attack on the mine.

If they flew in slowly from the periphery, it was likely that even before reaching the mine, they would attract the top powerhouses of the Elder Palace, who would wipe them out in one fell swoop.

This time, Shen Ling had gathered all the members of the Heavenly Realm’s Shadow Sect, and there were even five supreme-peak experts.

There were dozens of tier 6 peak-level Emperors.

And there were hundreds of Emperors with the top-level tier 6 strength.

This force, apart from the Divine Temple and the Elder Palace, could sweep through any place.

Including the mine.

Even if Land Hua personally intervened with his true body, he wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

As a flash of lightning crossed, the faces of these people turned pale. They had just undergone a special inheritance.

Soul Dao secret technique.

Soul Transmigration!

Hum!

An ancient humming sound echoed. As if receiving a command, these individuals voluntarily separated their physical bodies and divine bodies.

“Depart! Capture Jian Wushuang, and kill all the others, leaving none alive!”

“Yes!!!”

The mine.

Jian Wushuang circled around for a while and finally saw Nie Yuan. Without further disguise, he directly transformed back into his original appearance.

“Nie Yuan!”

Upon hearing his name, Nie Yuan paused for a moment. The voice calling his name sounded familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before. He turned around to look.

“Jian Wushuang!” When he saw Jian Wushuang, he was somewhat surprised.

He didn’t expect that the Inheritor mentioned by Wu Zuo was none other than Jian Wushuang, with whom he had some acquaintance.

Initially, Jian Wushuang was just a Dao Lord, with strength comparable to a peak-level tier 2 Emperor at most.

Now, judging by the aura, he was even more powerful than Nie Yuan.

Inheritors were indeed extraordinary!

Nie Yuan was shocked in his heart.

“Follow me!” Jian Wushuang didn’t waste any words. Since he had directly revealed his true self, it was likely that he would be discovered soon. The people guarding this place had not noticed them yet.

He still had a chance to catch his breath.

Nie Yuan followed him, and the two of them didn’t hold back at all, advancing at full speed. Their figures were like flashes of lightning.

Those who passed by couldn’t help but look at them more.

“Where is my daughter?” Nie Yuan couldn’t help but feel excited.

Without looking back, Jian Wushuang whispered, “Her location is a bit off, but you’ll see her soon. Oh, I forgot to tell you, her name is Gong Miaoyi!”

“Gong Miaoyi, Miaoyi!” Nie Yuan’s eyes turned red; he was about to see his daughter soon.
