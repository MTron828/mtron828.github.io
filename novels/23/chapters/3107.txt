Chapter 3108: Silver Demon

——

“Is this a magic array?”

Four God looked at the barrier in front of him and could not help but fly into a rage. He also tried to break the barrier, but his attack hit the barrier in front of him and did not shake it at all.

They were going to chase after Prince Qing and Yuan Chong, but now they were blocked by this barrier.

“Who is it? Who cast the formation?”

Shen Si looked around in shock and anger.

Soon, he saw Jian Wushuang behind him.

“Huh?” Shen Si looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

He had sent two powerful rank three True Saints to kill Jian Wushuang, but in the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang was unharmed, but the two rank three True Saints were gone!

It was obvious that they had been killed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Led by Shen Si, the group returned to Jian Wushuang again. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Boy, did you use the magic array around you?” Shen Si asked coldly.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “This magic array is very strong. You can’t break it with your strength alone. If you want to kill Prince Qing and Mr. Yuan Chong, you have to kill me first.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was very calm. He was facing nearly 30 experts, including a rank five True Saint and more than 10 rank four True Saints, but his expression did not change at all.

“Since you want to die, I’ll grant you your wish!”

Four God shouted, and his right hand, which was wearing a black glove, suddenly struck out.

It seemed to be a casual strike, but it completely exploded his rank five True Saint’s divine power. This palm was filled with the vast Principles Master, and the moment it struck out, a mournful sound echoed in the sky, a large amount of divine power gathered crazily, forming a huge black demonic lion.

The black demonic lion was extremely violent. After it formed, it pounced directly at Jian Wushuang.

If a rank five True Saint attacked with all his strength, it should be able to destroy the divine body of an ordinary rank three True Saint in one move.

This was the intention of the palm strike from Four God.

However, when he saw the black demonic lion approaching, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but there was a sharp glint in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang moved.

He waved his hand. Whoosh!

A swift and fierce sword light smashed out like a blood-red thunderbolt that suddenly fell from a clear sky.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

The sword light was swift and fierce, and the ruthless aura was overwhelming. When it came into contact with the black demonic lion, it was accompanied by Jian Wushuang’s equally powerful divine power, the terrifying power caused the black demonic lion to tremble crazily. Then, the sword light cut through the center of the black demonic lion.

Whoosh! A large amount of divine power spread out in all directions.

Jian Wushuang had already passed through the black demonic lion and continued to rush toward Shen Si.

“How is this possible?” Shen Si was shocked.

Not only him but the rank three and rank four True Saints behind him were also shocked.

A rank three True Saint actually defeated the attack of a rank five True Saint?

“Shen Si’s strength is only that of a rank five True Saint. It’s meaningless to fight him alone. So, you should all attack together.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. When he appeared in front of Shen Si and the others, he struck again.

Whoosh!

The sword swept across, and a scarlet sword shadow burst out.

The sword shadow was like the setting sun, shining with red light.

However, the ‘setting sun’ was obviously incomplete.

Wushuang Sword Manual…Canyang!

Buzz!

The sword shadow swept across the void in front of him, instantly creating a large area of space ripples, which were all red in color.

“Scram!”

Death roared furiously, his right hand forming a fist as he smashed out fiercely.

An explosive force smashed onto the scarlet sword shadow. When the two collided, Four God’s body trembled slightly and he took two steps back.

Meanwhile, the scarlet sword shadow was also smashed apart. However, after the sword shadow exploded…a sudden rumble~ An endless killing force swept out. An enormous space-time storm instantly took shape, is actually in front of a lot of strong people are covered in.

“Look out!”

“Space-time storm? No, space-time annihilation!”

“My god, swordsmanship contains the annihilation of time and space, and it is so extensive!”

Exclamations of surprise rang out from the mouths of those rank three and rank four True Saints, whose expressions were quite wonderful.

Space-time annihilation was a move that could completely annihilate all matter in space-time, including divine power.

The move that Jian Wushuang was using now was a perfect combination of swordsmanship and space-time annihilation. While the power of his swordsmanship was greatly enhanced, the power and range of space-time annihilation were also greatly enhanced.

Moreover, such a large area of space-time annihilation covered all of them, instantly causing chaos in the void.

Under such chaos, Jian Wushuang made his move.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One after another, strange silver light jumped and shuttled in the space-time storm.

The silver light changed so fast that it made people feel as if they were surrounded by silver light.

Buzz!

The sword light shot out soundlessly. It was the first move of the Peerless Sword Manual, Star Dream!

The cold sword light directly cut into the waist of a rank four True Saint. The terrifying tearing force instantly tore through the armor of the rank four True Saint and passed through his divine body, the rank four True Saint had only used two drops of the god-killing poison, but he had already died.

After killing the rank four True Saint, Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed again, but he appeared behind a rank three True Saint.

“Chi!”

The rank three True Saint’s head was thrown away by the same sword attack.

Jian Wushuang disappeared again…

“Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!”!

The sound of swords entering one’s body was not noticeable in the howling space-time storm. However, every time the sound was heard, a True Saint expert would be killed on the spot.

In less than a breath’s time, eight experts had died at Jian Wushuang’s hands!

The remaining experts finally found the silver demon, who was shaking and killing in the space-time storm.

“My God!”

“Be careful, be careful behind you, ah…no!”

“He’s too fast, he’s too fast, we don’t know where he is!”

The remaining experts all panicked.

They thought that Jian Wushuang was only a rank three True Saint, so they did not need to take him seriously. They did not expect that this rank three True Saint was actually a demon.

Yes, a demon!

His speed was too fast, incredibly fast!

Like Shen Si, he was a genuine rank five True Saint who was also good at speed, but his speed was far inferior to Jian Wushuang’s.
