Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At that moment, Jian Wushuang gazed at Zhuge Qiu with sparkling eyes and a roaring battle intent.

The experts on the island were all stunned at the scene unfolding before them.

“Is Jian Wushuang crazy?”

As a Universe Master, how could Jian Wushuang have such an overwhelming battle intent when facing an advanced Universe God.

He must be crazy!

Jian Wushuang ignored all the watchful eyes and took out a gold gourd.

He unsealed the gourd and instantly, a loud sound could be heard.

Weng! Weng!

Along with the sound, a sandstorm erupted and swept over the surroundings. In its midst,?were some aquamarine flames.

The huge Blaze Quicksand covered the whole of?Leopard-print Island in an instant.

Everyone on the island was covered by it.

“What is this?” Many people were amazed by this skill.

“Quicksand Realm, oppress!” Jian Wushuang suddenly shouted.

As his voice rang out, the huge quicksand immediately spread out. Boom! The Blaze Quicksand rushed toward Zhuge Qiu, like a cage about to trap him.

Facing the oncoming force, Zhuge Qiu had nowhere to hide and could only face it.

Zhuge Qiu’s expression changed slightly as he was pressed downward.

“Is this a Realm press?

“It’s so powerful!”

Zhuge Qiu was a bit shocked.

Though he was a Universe God near the peak of the First Heaven, at that moment, about thirty percent of his power had been suppressed under the realm.

A good thirty percent!

For a Universe God, even one-tenth decrease in power meant a lot. Now, his power was weakened to the level of Universe God Qian Luan and Universe God Wu.

“How could this kid get hold of such a powerful Realm Treasure?”?Zhuge Qiu looked at Wushuang with a trace of greed in his eyes.

Dayu Region was different from Green Fire World.

Green Fire World was home to many treasures, such as Chaos Magic Treasures. However, in Dayu Region, the Realm Treasures were very rare, especially a treasure like Blaze Quicksand Gourd, which many Universe Gods coveted.

“If I kill him, then that gourd will be mine!”?Zhuge Qiu thought and rubbed his hands in glee.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who was operating the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, spotted the greed in Zhuge Qiu’s eyes and smiled.

The next moment… FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang roared and charged at his opponent right under everyone’s eyes.

His battle intent kept rising. Obviously, his desire to fight against Zhuge Qiu was very strong..

“You’re courting death!”

Zhuge Qiu was not angry and laughed instead. He dashed out as well.

The battlefield immediately changed to the void.

The Blood Mountain Sword trembled slightly in Jian Wushuang’s hands. At that moment, Jian Wushuang used all his power, including the power of Stage Two of the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

When he was fighting with Universe God Lei Ming, he had only used the power of the first level of the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

Now, he used the power of the second level.

He had exerted his powers to the extreme!

There was also an oppression from the Blaze Quicksand.

At this point, Jian Wushuang really did go all out.

“Three Waves!”

As Jian Wushuang swung his sword, there were three sword shadows striking out at the same time.

With his killing intent shooting up to the sky, Zhuge Qiu drew close to Jian Wushuang and punched him with both hands.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three deep crashing noises sounded one after another and the explosive blast wave that followed forced the surrounding experts to draw back quickly in horror.

At the center of the battlefield, after taking three strikes from Jian Wushuang, Zhuge Qiu had a cold glint in his eyes..

“An Ying!”

Phew!

A black lightning flashed in the air, without making any sound, looking like a black snake.

It flew toward Jian Wushuang at an amazingly fast speed.

“Piss off!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and brandished his sword. A sword shadow struck out and destroyed the lightning.

“Nirvana!”

Jian Wushuang then displayed a unique skill of an advanced Level.

An enormous power flowed to his sword and a dazzling sword light flashed in the air, as bright as the sun.

With a sway of Zhuge Qiu’s body, a huge spectral image of an Exotic Beast appeared behind him. He then stretched out and punched Jian Wushuang.

If his fist were to land on any normal Universe God, that person would have been killed instantly.

However, when the palm met Jian Wushuang’s sword light, another loud sound could be heard. The power behind the sword burst forth.

“Humph!”

Zhuge Qiu let out a groan and could not help falling back. He shot a glance at his palm and felt a stinging pain where there was a red mark on it.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice resounded throughout the place as he slashed at Zhuge Qiu again.

“Kid, don’t be so frivolous!” Zhuge Qiu’s nerves twitched in his head. He was enraged and right then, two more spectral images of Exotic Beasts appeared behind him.

There were in total three spectral images of Exotic Beasts, towering over the place.

Zhuge Qiu looked grave and as he went forward, the three Exotic Beasts roared together.

In a moment, Jian Wushuang and Zhuge Qiu were once again engaged in a fierce battle.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Deafening sounds could be continuously heard as they fought on.

The experts on the island from both sides widened their eyes at the sight before them.

They were all dumbfounded.

Even Universe God Qian Luan, Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming could not help being astonished

“Jian Wushuang… He is able to battle so well against Zhuge Qiu?”?Universe God Qian Luan gasped in surprise.

“I thought he was powerful, but I never expected him to be that powerful.”?Universe God Lei Ming sighed and secretly felt better about his defeat. After all, he had lost to a man who was as powerful as Zhuge Qiu.

“I never thought that there was such a super genius in Scarlet Island?” Universe God Wu gasped in admiration.

Fighting head on!

It was true that Jian Wushuang had gone all out in his battle with Zhuge Qiu.
