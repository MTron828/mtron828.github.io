Chapter 2241 Gathering the Assistants

Chu He quickly contacted the experts from the ancient past.One would expect Old Monster to be able to contact even more powerful experts given how powerful he was.

In reality, many of the experts with similar fighting power to Old Monster Jiao escaped out of this heaven and earth when they realised something was amiss. Only a small number of people were stuck there and fell into slumber as they hadn’t escape in time.

The number of experts at his level was already small, much less the number of experts at his level and awakened. This resulted in Old Monster Jiao finding it difficult to find experts to help him in his cause.

Hence, he could only command his subordinate, Chu He, to contact the experts in the Divine Demon Realm.

...

Eternal Chaotic World, Purple Moon Sanctuary.

There was an auction going on within a large town.

This auction was of a very high level and hence it attracted numerous experts, including several almighties who came down personally.

A man and a teenage girl were sat within one of the independent rooms.

The lazy man wore a long robe and looked down every now and then at the items that were being auctioned with interest.

As for the dirty teenage girl in green clothes, she was eating some fruits and did not bother looking down at the auction at all.

“Senior Brother. The Restrictions of Heaven and Earth are so strong and the spiritual influence of heaven and earth is so thin. This auction is also not of the highest standard. There shouldn’t be anything good here. I have no idea why you decided to come here,” the teenage girl in green clothes complained.

“Haha, Junior Sister. You do not understand. There might not be anything good in this era. However, the people of this place protect the ancient battlefield. On that battlefield, countless experts died. There are almost unlimited amounts of treasures and opportunities there. Many of those treasures were found and have circulated around in this world. If we look carefully, we might find some precious treasures which we, as experts in the Divine Demon Realm, would normally have no way of attaining,” the lazy man said.

“Even so, have you found any of the precious treasures you have been talking about?” The dirty teenage girl in green clothes retorted.

“For now, no. Looks like you are right. These auctions are of too low a level. The truly precious treasures should be in the hands of the top tier experts of this era. For example, Sanctuary Alliance...” the lazy man said,

“Sanctuary Alliance? Senior Brother, you are going to try something funny against the Sanctuary Alliance?” the dirty teenage girl in green clothes looked over and asked.

The lazy man laughed awkwardly.

Both of them had been awake for a period of time. They had a certain amount of understanding of this era. They know that Sanctuary Alliance had two very powerful experts, Sword Emperor and Emperor Bai.

With the presence of the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the pair did not dare to try anything funny with them.

Right then...

“Huh?” The lazy man was stunned before he stood up suddenly.

“What happened, Senior Brother?” the dirty teenage girl in green clothes asked curiously.

“Haha~~~ Junior sister. Remember when I said I wouldn’t dare to fight the Sanctuary Alliance? That would indeed be true if it was just the two of us. However, things have changed,” the lazy man roared with laughter.

“What do you mean?” The dirty teenage girl in green clothes wondered aloud.

“One of my good friends just transmitted me a message. Lord Jiao’s ride was killed by Emperor Bai from Sanctuary Alliance. Lord Jiao is very angry and is trying to gather experts in the Divine Demon Realm to take revenge on Emperor Bai,” the lazy man said.

“Lord Jiao? You mean the Lord Jiao from the Holy Land?” the dirty teenage girl in green clothes was stunned.

“That is him. He is rewarding those who help him with a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir after they return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World!” the lazy man’s eyes lit up in excitement.

“Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir?” The dirty girl in green clothes was overjoyed.

The Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir was something experts in the Divine Demon Realm would go crazy for.

“Junior Sister, let’s go. We should hurry. We cannot miss such a good opportunity,” the lazy man said.

“Okary,” the dirty teenage girl in green clothes nodded her head.

The two of them headed for where Lord Jiao was at the fastest speed possible.

...

A purple figure stood in the air above a vast ocean within the Colored Glaze Sanctuary.

He wore a noble purple long-sleeved shirt. His hair and his irises were purple as well.

He was walking within the area casually. Suddenly, he stopped as he was surprised.

“Old Monster Jiao asked me to help him? If I don’t he will use whatever power he has back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World to try and kill me after we return? Humph. Based on the fact he was stronger than me back then and he came from a holy land, he looked down on me. Now he is asking me to help him by threatening me?” the purple figure knitted his eyebrows and said.

This purple figure was Chen Qi, someone was above the Divine Demon Realm.

Chen Qi was disgusted by Old Monster Jiao. However, he feared Old Monster Jiao as he had an incredible background. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Even though he threatened me, he knows his limits. He promised me a favour, and his favour...” Chen Qi started contemplating.

It was not because Old Monster Jiao was more powerful than him. More importantly, it was because of his background in the Holy Land.

It would have been difficult to get a favor from someone like him in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Now...

“Nevermind. I will first check it out. If his attitude is better, I do not mind helping him. However, if he is still so cocky, I will not bother with him. Does he really think it is so easy to kill me back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World?”

Chen Qi grunted as he left for where Old Monster Jiao was.

It was not just Chen Qi and the two siblings who were at the auction, many experts from the ancient past who had awakened received invitations from Old Monster Jiao. They had to help him do something in exchange for one Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir.

Many of them were in awe at the price Old Monster Jiao was willing to pay. Many of them replied and headed to where Old Monster Jiao was.

Within three years, more than twenty experts from the ancient past gathered at the mountain dwelling where Old Monster Jiao resided.

Within the dwelling, there were more than twenty experts in the realm of divine demons. Some of them knew each other, while others didn’t. Even so, they were chatting casually.

Even though there were differences between their fighting power, there were in the same realm. Furthermore, they were all trapped within this Heaven and Earth and were under its restrictions. Hence, they did not put up a front when interacting with each other.
