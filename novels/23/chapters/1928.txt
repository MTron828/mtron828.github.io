1929 Friendly?

Hearing what Emperor Bai said, Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

He felt that Emperor Bai was right.

Although Lineage of Star had won a great victory in the war, the two alliances would still possess fierce power if they were to reconstruct their teams.

If Lineage of Star were to fight against the two alliances outside the galaxy formation, Lineage of Star really wouldn’t stand much chance.

As for destroying the major forces, it really was impossible.

“Emperor Bai, I promise you that Lineage of Star will not find trouble with the two alliances for now. However, if the two alliances were to find trouble with us, you couldn’t blame me for that,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t worry. As long as the two alliances aren’t dumb, they should know what to do. Plus, Sanctuary Alliance will definitely send Great Emperors to give them warning personally,” Emperor Bai said with a smile.

Emperor Bai paused and continued, “The last condition, I’d like to know where did Emperor Thirteen come from and how is he related to you?”

“Emperor Thirteen?” Jian Wushuang was stunned then he flashed a bitter smile, “Emperor Bai, to be frank with you, Emperor Thirteen and I merely met once and we are not related to each other at all. However, when we first met, I am not sure why but he left a mark in my body. This time, when I am in danger, he rushed over to me via the mark.”

“As for his origins and why he helped me, I really have no idea.”

Jian Wushuang was stating the truth.

He really didn’t know anything about Emperor Thirteen.

The only thing that he knew was that Emperor Thirteen was an ancient expert and he was from the ancient battlefield in his hometown.

However, he would definitely not tell Emperor Bai about the ancient battlefield located in his hometown.

“I see,” Emperor Bai creased his eyebrows, “Emperor Thirteen is definitely a super expert from ancient times. He would save you and urge me to take care of you, it meant that he was related to you but you have no idea why.”

“Forget it. Ancient time was a secret to begin with. The ancient experts were mysterious.”

Emperor Bai smiled faintly. From his reply, it was obvious that he had once met an ancient expert and probably more than one.

“Jian Wushuang, as you agreed with all the conditions that I bought up, I shall give you the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill.”

Emperor Bai said as he flipped his hand and took out a grey bead.

Jian Wushuang’s heart quivered at the sight of the grey bead.

He was very familiar with the grey bead.

From the beginning of cultivation skill until every step of inverse cultivation skill, they were all contained in a grey bead.

The grey bead was extremely mysterious and Jian Wushuang had yet to find out what mysterious raw material the grey bead made of.

“The seventh step of inverse cultivation skill is in the bead. Take a look,” Emperor Bai passed the grey bead to Jian Wushuang directly.

Jian Wushuang took it and briefly went through it. He was thrilled.

He knew that it was really the seventh step of the inverse cultivation skill.

“Thank you Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang quickly thanked.

“You’re welcome,” Emperor Bai waved his hand.

“Emperor Bai, let me bring you to Lineage of Star’s Scripture Depository to accept the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright,” Emperor Bai nodded.

Under Jian Wushuang’s lead, Emperor Bai arrived at Scripture Depository and started receiving the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Very soon, Emperor Bai walked out from Scripture Depository after inheritance had been completed.

“Emperor Bai, how did it go?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Secret Skill of Star Palace is unfathomable. Although I received all three volumes, I’m afraid I could only cultivate the first volume,” Emperor Bai smiled faintly.

“Emperor Bai could only cultivate the first volume as well?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

It was as though everyone found it difficult to cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Most of them could only cultivate the first volume. Some couldn’t even cultivate the first volume after they received the inheritance.

As for the Master of Star Palace, he absorbed a drop of blood essence that belonged to an expert of Seven Star Black Sect by chance. Hence, he successfully cultivated the second volume.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t find the secret skill difficult.

When he cultivated it, it could be considered smooth-sailing. He had even cultivated the third volume.

It inevitably made Jian Wushuang felt surprised.

After Emperor Bai had received the inheritance, he didn’t stay back any longer.

In the galaxy, the experts from Lineage of Star, led by Jian Wushuang, came to farewell Emperor Bai.

“Jian Wushuang, this is my communication token. If you come across any problem in the future, you can send me a message,” Emperor Bai gave Jian Wushuang his communication token before he left.

The surrounding experts were surprised at the sight.

Especially Purple Moon Emperor, he felt a complicated feeling and he was looking at Jian Wushuang in jealousy.

One should know that Emperor Bai was the strongest person in Sanctuary Alliance and he was always aloof and set himself high. The experts from Sanctuary Alliance, including the Great Emperors, only two or three of them had his communication token. Great Emperors on the bottom of the level, like Purple Moon Emperor, never once had it. If he were to be looking for Emperor Bai, he had to look for someone to pass the message.

But then, Jian Wushuang had received Emperor Bai’s communication token.

Plus, Emperor Bai was normally cold to others, even to Great Emperors. However, he was extremely friendly to Jian Wushuang.

Purple Moon Emperor was even more confused.

After Emperor Bai left, Purple Moon Emperor immediately came forward.

“Jian Wushuang, congratulations! Emperor Bai’s communication token, even I don’t have it,” Purple Moon Emperor smiled and his attitude was entirely different from before.

When he had been talking to Jian Wushuang earlier, he had referred to himself with an honorable pronoun. Then, he had only referred to himself as “I”.

“Purple Moon Emperor, you must be joking. I am only lucky. Plus, Emperor Bai seems to be an easy person to talk to,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“An easy person?” Purple Moon Emperor smiled awkwardly.

Jian Wushuang really found Emperor Bai friendly and easy to talk to.

At least, during their conversation earlier, Emperor Bai didn’t put on bureaucratic airs, nor did he impose anything on him.

For instance, Emperor Bai could make Lineage of Star hand him the Secret Skill of Star Palace with one order.

For Lineage of Star and the two alliances to stop the war, it could also be only ordered by Emperor Bai.

However, Emperor Bai didn’t force the order but traded with him for the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill. Even when he told Jian Wushuang to stop Lineage of Star from fighting with the two alliances, he weighed the pros and cons on Jian Wushuang’s behalf and let Jian Wushuang make the final decision.

Then, Emperor Bai took the initiative to give him his communication token, even Jian Wushuang was surprised himself.

“Could it be because Emperor Thirteen wanted Emperor Bai to take care of me, and that’s why Emperor Bai is gentle to me?” Jian Wushuang was confused, “That’s not right. Although Emperor Thirteen is powerful, there’s no need to curry favor with me, right?”
