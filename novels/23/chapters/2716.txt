Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Spring passed and winter arrived and twenty-five years had passed in the blink of an eye. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Danyang Continent had remained in a balance during that period as there were not any huge fights.

The top forces were still accumulating their strength and waiting for an opportunity.

As for the Crimson Stone Fort, the seven factions were still fighting among themselves. However, Yin Su’er had a huge amount of resources after she successfully sold the Royal Blood Gem and had been continuously attracting experts with the help of those resources so the pressure she faced had been tremendously reduced. She was in a far less passive position in the situation she was facing.

On the other hand, the Sword Alliance had been recruiting during that time period but they had not continued their expansion as they too had been accumulating their power.

Apart from that, the Sword Alliance was not only a publicly recognized first-rated force but was also one of the strongest first-rated forces.

The highest-leveled Grand Ultimate Gods aside, the amount of Heaven Ultimate Gods in the Sword Alliance were a terrifying number.

The Divine Sword Army alone had already expanded to a total of 500 people!

All of those 500 people were Heaven Ultimate Gods and extremely strong. They had extremely high combat power as they knew how to coordinate between military and magic formations.

Jian Wushuang spent a huge amount of resources that was enough to cause distress to any of the top forces during the army’s formation. However, Jian Wushuang did not have any scruples as he had not planned to stay for a long time in the Danyang Holy Domain. Therefore, he used all the resources he had on hand as he did not care much about preservation.

None of the top forces in the Danyang Continent would dare put all their resources into build an army like him.

The combat power of the Divine Sword Army rose speedily because of that. As a result, only the Crimson Stone Official Army from Crimson Stone Fort was slightly stronger than the Divine Sword Army. It was estimated those armies formed by other top forces were at most the same level as the Divine Sword Army.

Jian Wushuang was still understanding the laws and Sword Principle with the help of both Fengtian Scrolls in his secret chamber.

Suddenly, a message token in his interspatial ring slightly trembled.

‘Is it starting?’ Jian Wushuang immediately opened his eyes and a wicked smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.

Jian Wushuang immediately left his retreat. He then gathered Xiao Tiexin and the others.

“I need to go out and handle some matters but I’ll be back in a short while. Xin’er, you shall be in charge of every matter in the Sword Alliance while I’m away,” Jian Wushuang ordered.

“Yes, Master.” Xiao Tiexin immediately nodded.

Sword Alliance’s top management experts such as Sheng Long, Purple Dress House Master, and Long Shan looked at each other but dared not show any signs of displeasure.

Xiao Tiexin was the one who took care of most matters regarding the Sword Alliance when Jian Wushuang was in retreat.

Although Xiao Tiexin was not a powerful expert, she had good management skills. Apart from that, most of the Sword Alliance’s resources were under her control and she had trained many loyal experts. She had succeeded in building her prestige in the Sword Alliance.

Nobody dared to say anything when the Sword Alliance’s matters were handed over to her.

“Xin’er, you need to be careful during this time when I’m away. Try your best to reduce the collision between the Sword Alliance and the first-rated forces around us.” Jian Wushuang continued to issue orders, “Old Snake, assist her in every way possible.”

“Yes, Master.” Xiao Tiexin and Old Snake continuously nodded.

Jian Wushuang was at ease with a strong Primary-level Grand Ultimate God such as Old Snake keeping watch and his most trusted Xin’er controlling everything else.

He immediately made a move.

...

In a void near to the edge of the Danyang Continent.

A thin elder was standing there as he waited in silence.

The elder was the Devilish Wind King.

Whoosh!

A figure came gliding over and arrived in front of the Devilish Wind King within moments.

“Devilish Wind King, I hope I’m not too late.” Jian Wushuang had a smile on his face.

“No, you’re the earliest to reach this place apart from me.” Devilish Wind King smiled. However, he narrowed his eyes in surprise when he suddenly noticed the divine power coming from Jian Wushuang.

“You’ve made a breakthrough?” The Devilish Wind King focused his gaze on Jian Wushuang and could feel that Jian Wushuang’s divine power had reached the Primary-level Grand Ultimate God from his original Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

“Haha... Luck has allowed me to make a breakthrough a short while ago.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

It was true that he had made a breakthrough.

Although he had been working on understanding the law and Sword Principle within these 30 years of secluded cultivation, he had also been cultivating to increase his divine power. The most crucial point was the 16,000 Divine Elixir Pills he obtained from Palace Keeper Si Zhen and Fo Yi—he had successfully refined all those pills.

Therefore, his divine power had increased tremendously and successfully achieved the High-level Heaven Ultimate God realm.

His true realm was a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, but his divine power had been elevated by two levels under the black stone’s concealment which was why the Devilish Wind King thought Jian Wushuang had already achieved the Grand Ultimate God.

‘He was able to kill Fo Yi in one-to-one combat thirty years ago when he had not made a breakthrough and was just a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. Now that he has made a breakthrough in his realm and really achieved the Grand Ultimate God realm, his strength has definitely undergone some changes. He must have the strength comparable to a High-level Grand Ultimate God.’ The Devilish Wind King could not help but think to himself.

“Devilish Wind King, where are the other four?” Jian Wushuang asked as he stood beside the Devilish Wind King.

“Don’t worry, they will arrive soon.” The Devilish Wind King looked forward as he spoke. Suddenly, two black dots appeared at the other end of the void in front of them.

“The two of them are here. They must have traveled together,” said the Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang also immediately looked towards those two black dots.

Those two dots traveling speedily turned out to be two human figures and appeared in front of them in the blink of an eye.

They were a man and a woman.

The man was muscular and had messy red hair while both his facial expression and eyes were extremely fierce. He crossed his arms around his chest and gave others a feeling that he was extremely rough.

On the other hand, the woman appeared to be an extremely delicate lady in a purple dress that made people feel affectionate towards her.

The purple-clad lady was extremely beautiful with her every move having rippling effects on those people who saw her.

However, Jian Wushuang dared not look down at the both of them as he stood before them. It did not only apply to the rough and burly man but also the beautiful purple-clad lady too.

It was because he had discovered those two were emitting an extremely strong divine power.

Their divine power was not something common Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods had—already surpassed Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

That man and woman pair were both High-level Grand Ultimate Gods!
