2012 Arrival

In the boundless darkness.

There was a flash of lights in Abysmal Saint Master’s eyes. Then, there was instantly a darkness storm that covered the body of Silver-Winged God Mansion Master.

Abysmal Saint Master had already started using his way to question Silver-Winged God Mansion Master forcefully while Jian Wushuang and the other two members watched.

However, just as the four of them were questioning Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, there were six figures that arrived simultaneously in the void near the estate.

The six of them were four males and two females. They were led by a brawny, bald man who was only five foot three.

“The spacetime in front of us is completely sealed off. No wonder Silver-Winged God Mansion Master didn’t respond even when I sent him a message personally,” a scrawny elder dressed in black said.

The elder in black was the state leader where Silver-Winged God Mansion was located.

“It seems like we are slightly late. It is impossible for us to set up a trap ahead of time. We can only fight against them head-on and kill all of them,” an old lady in a red robe said with a cold voice. She looked around and asked, “Have you gone through the information of the four intruders?”

“Of course,” the others nodded beside the brawny, bald man.

“Among the four of them, Abysmal Saint Master is the most powerful one. As for the other three, their power is more ordinary. There is even one who is only in Early Stage Chaotic Realm. With our team formation, it shouldn’t be easy for us to kill them,” the old lady in a red robe said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Don’t belittle the one the Early Stage Chaotic Realm.”

It was a hoarse voice. The one who spoke was the bald man. Then, there was a malicious smile in the corner of his lips. He added in a deep voice, “According to the information we have, this person who is named Sword Emperor in Early Stage Chaotic Realm, his true fighting power is not any weaker than a Peak Chaotic Realm. To be able to match against Peak Chaotic Realm in Early Stage Chaotic Realm level, all of us do not have the same power.”

The other five nodded at the bald man’s remark.

They didn’t belittle Sword Emperor though.

If Jian Wushuang and his members were to hear their conversation, they would be surprised.

Because not only did they know how many of them would barge into Three-Emperor World, but they also know who the people were.

On top of that, they obtained information about the four of them long ago.

One should know that only the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance knew which four were going to be members of the expert troop to barge into the dark millstone.

However, the people behind the dark millstone obviously knew and they knew in detail.

“Alright. Let’s not waste time. Let’s do it. I will set up a great formation around here so they couldn’t escape. However, there’s one among them who is good at spacetime skill. She should be able to flee from my formation if she is given enough time. Hence, you have to fight a quick battle,” the old lady in a red robe said.

“Mm,” the others nodded.

“The few of you go ahead first. I will take a look,” the bald man was the only one who smiled maliciously.

The other five had no comment about that.

Swoosh!

The five figures moved simultaneously.

In the magnificent estate, the Silver-Winged God Mansion Master looked terrified and hopeless. He stood there as his gaze became empty gradually.

Although he was in Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, also an Emperor God level expert, he wouldn’t last long before the fighting power of four Great Emperor alone, especially when Abysmal Saint Master pulled some magical tricks. He presented everything that he knew on a silver platter.

Jian Wushuang and his troop finally received a piece of important information from Silver-Winged God Mansion Master.

It was the existence of the Imperial Cabinet!!

Three-Emperors World had broad territories, twelve states, eighty-four God Mansions, and one thousand three hundred regions.

It was already well-known. But in actual fact, on the top of the pyramid in Three-Emperors World wasn’t the twelve states but the Imperial Cabinet!

The Imperial Cabinet was the true ruler of Three-Emperors World. It equaled a Monarch of an ordinary Kingdom.

However, the Imperial Cabinet had hidden all along but not shown in public.

In Three-Emperors World, only those experts on the peak of the world were qualified to know the existence of the Imperial Cabinet.

For example, the twelve state leaders and the eighty-four God Mansion Masters knew about the Imperial Cabinet. However, there were extremely few experts among the one thousand and three hundred region masters who were qualified to know that.

Double Dragon Region Master that they found previously was ordinary. Hence, he wasn’t qualified to know the existence of the Imperial Cabinet.

“According to Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, the Imperial Cabinet controls everything in Three-Emperors World.?For instance, the post of the eighty-four God Mansion Masters and a thousand three hundred Region Masters have to be approved by the Imperial Cabinet. As for the twelve state leaders, although they were Great Emperor level experts, they have to receive orders from the Imperial Cabinet.”

“In other words, the Imperial Cabinet is the true core of this world. If we want to know the true secret of this world and we want to find the core of this dark millstone, we have to go through the Imperial Cabinet,” Abysmal Saint Master concluded.

“Where is the location of the Imperial Cabinet, and how do we enter the Imperial Cabinet?” Jian Wushuang stared at Silver-Winged God Mansion Master and asked.

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master naturally answered frankly.

From his reply, Jian Wushuang and the other members found out the location of the Imperial Cabinet and something about the Imperial Cabinet.

“We found out what we needed to find out. Silver-Winged God Mansion Master is useless now. I reckon who wouldn’t find out anything new even if we asked,” Jian Wushuang said.

Abysmal Saint Master nodded faintly and the boundless darkness immediately formed a huge hand and hovered over Silver-Winged God Mansion Master. In an instance, Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was killed.

After that, they were prepared to leave.

But suddenly…

“Oh, no!” Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s face changed, “Someone barged into the spacetime that was sealed off. Great Emperor and there are more than one!”

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao were shocked.

“They found us so quickly?” Abysmal Saint Master’s face grew in distress.

“They are really fast,” Jian Wushuang commented too.

They entered Three-Emperors World through the dark millstone previously. As the great formation around the dark millstone was controlled by someone, they definitely know that someone invaded.

The person should also know their rough location. It was normal that the person immediately sent experts over to kill them as well.

But Jian Wushuang and his troop never expected the person would be so swift in action.

They just entered Three-Emperors World not too long ago. They just obtained some useful information and found out the existence of the Imperial Cabinet. Then, their enemy already formed a group of experts to hunt them down.

This speed and efficiency…

“Let’s go. Let’s leave!”

Abysmal Saint Master roared, then the four of them plunged out from the estate and appeared in the boundless void above.
