Chapter 779: Power to Break Barriers!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The giant gold finger was obviously much stronger than the Red Shade Sword Move.

This was the First Finger of Three Fingers of the Ancient God!

Aside from Jian Wushuang himself, no one knew that his current strongest move was not the Secret Skills that he created, nor was it the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. Instead, it was the Ancient God Clan’s utmost unique skill that he attained from his Inherited Memory after becoming an Ancient God.

Three Fingers of the Ancient God…

The First Finger had the power to break barriers!

The Second Finger had the power to extinguish stars!

The Third Finger had the power to shatter worlds!

This was the strongest skill from the Inherited Memory of the Ancient God Clan.

Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Ancient God Clan for such a long period of time, but he had never heard that other clansmen had received Inherited Memory after changing into an Ancient God. Owing to his Imperial Bloodline, Jian Wushuang himself had awakened a part of Inherited Memory and obtained the Three Fingers of the Ancient God.

Only Ancient Gods were qualified to display this skill, which was extremely hard to do.

? ? Jian Wushuang had spent lots of time and energy studying this skill before he mastered the First Finger.

However, as a One-star Ancient God, he could barely perform it. Furthermore, this skill would exhaust a considerable amount of Spiritual Power and Bloodline Power. Hence, in order to display it, he had to spit out a part of his Essence Blood.

His strike shook everyone.

Even Tian Yunzi was astonished by the power of this giant gold finger.

Despite so, he did not intend to dodge it.

Seeing the giant gold finger moving towards him, Tian Yunzi snorted and suddenly threw a punch.

Boom!

After a loud sound was heard, a space rift appeared at the part of the Void where the two collided. It was like a spider web, expanding over a few feet.

The spectators were petrified.

“Space rifts!

“How is this possible?”

“Gosh!”

It was common to see space rifts in the Ancient World. Any attacks from a brilliant Skyscraping Realm expert could lead to such a phenomenon.

However, this was the Eternal World.

The space in there was much stabler than that in the Ancient World.

In a normal situation, even if dozens of or 100 Eternal Realm experts fought with their full strength, they would be unable to bring about space rifts.

But now, the head-on confrontation between Jian Wushuang’s finger and Tian Yunzi’s punch actually caused space rifts to spread over a radius of dozens of feet. How powerful their attacks were!

Whoosh! Jian Wushuang, who had transformed into a golden shadow, was thrown backward like a shooting star. He retreated 1,000 feet and smashed numerous hills before he regained his stance.

? ? On the other hand, Tian Yunzi was still composed. The mighty force of the impact only made him stagger a step back.

Although it was only a step, the spectators still gasped in shock.

“Retreat? He actually forced Tian Yunzi to retreat?”

“It was just one step, but it did happen!”

“This, this…”

“Incredible. That’s absolutely incredible!”

Numerous experts marveled at it.

Tian Yunzi’s expression darkened.

This one step was a big humiliation to him.

“Boy, I underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to possess a more powerful Finger Technique Secret Skill other than your amazing Sword Principle Secret Skill. Not only was it powerful, it even contains a part of the Bloodline Power. If I’m right, you obtained it from the Demon God Clan, right?

“Hum, the Demon God Clan is really a big Treasure Vault. They actually have powerful Secret Skills like this.”

Tian Yunzi spoke with a hint of fever in his eyes.

This was also normal. There were numerous Secret Skills in the Cloud Sea Asgard, but none of them was comparable to the move Jian Wushuang had unleashed.

Therefore, Tian Yunzi obviously coveted this powerful Secret Skill.

Jian Wushuang was in a terrible condition. His face was pale, and blood covered the corners of his mouth. His aura was also severely weakened.

The First Finger consumed all his Spiritual Power, so he had no strength to fight.

“He’s worthy of being a Dao Master. A mere doppelganger possesses such a terrifying battle strength. I’ve used my full strength to display the First Finger of the Ancient God, but I only made him take a step back. Instead, I’m the one that’s seriously injured.”?Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly and gained a new understanding of Dao Masters’ strength.

A Dao Master was terrifying indeed.

If a doppelganger was this scary, who knew what Tian Yunzi’s Original Body would be like?

Tian Yunzi spoke in an icy voice. “Jian Wushuang, it seems that your strength has run out. Do you still want to continue and not surrender? Do you really want me to break your limbs and then take you back to Cloud Sea Asgard?”

“Surrender?” Jian Wushuang smiled. Although he had no more strength to fight, his battle intent had not weakened.

“This doesn’t deserve my surrender.”

Jian Wushuang took out an item as he spoke.

It was a wilted yellow leaf.

This wilted leaf looked ordinary, but the other experts all sensed that it was something extraordinary.

“What’s that?”

“A wilted leaf? No, it looks unusual.”

“The situation has already become like this, does Jian Wushuang still have a trump card?”

The spectators widened their eyes and stared at the scene.

Jian Wushuang held this wilted leaf as he glanced at Tian Yunzi with a grim smile. “Tian Yunzi, the doppelganger is far inferior to the Original Body, but putting it together definitely cost you a lot, right?”

“So what?” Tian Yunzi was still calm.

“Hehe, since that’s the case, I’ll kill the doppelganger today!” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly.

Then, he crushed the wilted leaf.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
