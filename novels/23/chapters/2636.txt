Chapter 2637: Battling Qing Ze

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of nine impact explosions resonated as those nine asteroids charged without any hesitation.

Everything died down very soon.

“Nine swords combine, Heaven’s Edge!”

The nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords overlapped and formed a complete Transmigration Sword Formation as coldness shot out of Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

At the same time, a surging golden divine power gathered behind Jian Wushuang and formed a 9,000 meters tall Golden God Shadow in the blink of an eye.

The Golden God Shadow stood tall overlooking heaven and earth as Jian Wushuang’s aura once again surged radically.

“Kill!”

The black divine sword that was transformed from Transmigration Sword Formation penetrated the void like an awl and appeared once again before Qing Ze.

Qing Ze was surprised as he could also feel the unusual pressure from the sword formation. He immediately flipped his giant hand as a green battle saber appeared.

Whoosh!

A sharp saber-light flashed like lightning in the sunny sky and clashed head-on against the black divine sword.

Clank!

The black divine sword trembled slightly and paused for a second in the void before shooting out once again after a brief moment.

On the other hand, Qing Ze was being stunned backward for a few steps.

Not only did Qing Ze not get mad after steadying himself, but was also laughing as well. “Haha! Your battle strength is really high...” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Traces of green lightning began appearing on Qing Ze’s entire body which covered him like an armor of lightning after a series of crackling sounds. He had also at the same time grown twice from his original size.

He then took a step forward with his battle saber swung outward once again.

There was literally a bolt of violent green lightning descending from above at that time.

Boom!

The sound shook the heavens as the black divine sword flew backward and Qing Ze retreated three steps.

“Haha, let’s do it again!!”

Qing Ze let out loud maniacal laughter while he stepped forward and swung his battle saber again.

Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all as he clashed head-on with Qing Ze time and again with his Transmigration Sword Formation.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Violently overpowering energy ruthlessly swept outwards following those continuous collisions.

The booming noises resonated between heaven and earth.

Countless experts in the Blood Gem mineral vein, be it Divine Demon workers, Official Army soldiers, or even Crimson Stone Fort experts all noticed the activity.

Suddenly, many figures flew up.

There was a grandiose palace on the peak of one of the mountains as a middle-aged man clad in black battle armor looking strong like a bull walked outside from the palace. The middle-aged man was none other than the Grand Ultimate God, Scorpion King!

At that moment, he had also noticed the battle in the void not far from him.

“It’s Qing Ze fighting against the man... Huh? Isn’t that the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?” Scorpion King was shocked.

He had met the Territorial Lord once and recalled him being only a High-level Earth Ultimate God. However, he had already made a breakthrough to the Peak Earth Ultimate God in only two years. Not only that, he was even fighting fiercely against the Heaven Ultimate God Qing Ze as a Peak Earth Ultimate God at a similar battle prowess.

They were truly at a similar level.

Qing Ze’s saber skills were intense and violent with his overpowering energy. However, Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Sword Formation energy that burst out had reached the level of a Heaven Ultimate God with the help of Divine God of Punishment. The sword formation attacked continuously and collided against Qing Ze’s battle saber head-to-head while showing no signs of losing.

“Interesting.” Scorpion King broke out a smile. “The divine power between an Earth Ultimate God and Heaven Ultimate God should be ten times apart, not to mention the level of their principle and law understanding in addition to various tactics. However, this Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s abilities are truly quite on par with a Heaven Ultimate God judging from the way he controls the sword formation.

“This Northern Darkstar Territory Lord a genius?”

Genius!

Yes, he’s surely a genius for unleashing the battle strength comparable to Heaven Ultimate God while being an Earth Ultimate God!

There may not even be a small handful of geniuses such as him in the entire Danyang Holy Domain.

On the battlefield, Qing Ze began to feel quite embarrassed after multiple collisions and not gaining any the least bit of advantage.

Especially when there were so many Heaven Ultimate Gods from Crimson Stone Fort around who were laughing and jesting at him.

They talk about how a Heaven Ultimate God like him could not even handle a little Earth Ultimate God and brought embarrassment to all Heaven Ultimate Gods, etc. Although they were Qing Ze’s friends and just ridiculing him with friendliness, it still made Qing Ze feel insulted.

“I’m done with playing games!”

Qing Ze let out a low growl as the green lightning over his body suddenly burst out like a huge electric net spreading across his surroundings.

The infinitely intense saber essence spread along with it.

Boom!!

A powerful Principle World directly pressed against Jian Wushuang.

The Principle World of the Heaven Ultimate God had also reached Profound Realm.

Qing Ze shuttled in the net, dodging the attacks from Transmigration Sword Formation, and rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s physical body.

“Your sword formation is indeed strong, but it’s designed for range attacks. I’ll easily defeat you as long as I don’t go head-on against it like a fool and get close to you,” growled Qing Ze softly.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang sneered on the other hand.

A gigantic Sword World had befallen.

Although Jian Wushuang’s Sword World was only at Merit level and being held back without unleashing the Sword World’s full potential, the Sword World still matched Qing Ze’s Principle World in strength as it struck.

“What? A Merit Principle World could match my Profound Realm?” Qing Ze was rather surprised but did not care too much as he already appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Qing Ze held his battle saber in one hand which carried infinite green lightning like a God of Thunder.

Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

Three continuous strikes violently lashed out at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang sneered as his physical form suddenly shook.

Multiple apparitions appeared which filled the entire heaven and earth.

There were not less than 300 apparitions in a glance.

The apparitions moved unpredictably at lightning speeds such that even Heaven Ultimate God Qing Ze could not identify Jian Wushuang’s true physical form.

The three saber-lights finally ended up landing on an apparition.

A freezing-cold sword essence suddenly appeared at the same time.

Qing Ze subconsciously looked to the side as a tight-knit sword net had shrouded him while countless sword shadows attacked him one after another.

Qing Ze used his full might to block those sword shadows.

Both of them reverted to struggling against each other again as multiple metal clashing sounds started resonating.
