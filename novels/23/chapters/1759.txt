Chapter 1760: Old Monster Chi Xing

There were so many forces and sects that participated in the auction but Thunder Rolls Palace didn’t bother with them. But whenever Soaring Heaven King Palace shouted a bid, they immediately joined and competed in bidding.

They were obviously asking for trouble with Soaring Heaven King Palace!

“Thunder Rolls Palace, are they crazy?”

“Crazy, they must be crazy.”

“Thunder Rolls Palace must have increased in power tremendously and they are getting carried away.”

“Tsk tsk. I think Thunder Rolls Palace is courting death. They openly provoked Soaring Heaven King Palace. If I were to be Real God Xue Kong, I would immediately destroy Thunder Rolls Palace right when the auction ends.”

There were people whispering to one another. The experts from various forces and sect were waiting to watch a show.

Of course, they were also people whose eyes were dilated in curiosity. They faintly noticed that it wasn’t as simple as it looked.

The few experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace gathered and they didn’t look too good. Only the leader among them, Real God Xue Kong, flashed a bloodthirsty smile. “It seems like we of Soaring Heaven King Palace has not launched an attack for many years and the outside world already forget how scary Soaring Heaven King Palace is. Even a nonentity has the guts to provoke us in public.”

“Humph, Thunder Rolls Palace doesn’t even have any experts on Real God ranking list, let alone an Almighty. Such a sect, Soaring Heaven King Palace can destroy them in an instant. Wait till the auction ends, we shall immediately take action. First, kill all the people from Thunder Rolls Palace who came to join the auction,” one of the Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace said.

“No, it’s not as simple as you think it is,” Real God Xue Kong smiled maliciously, “What does Thunder Rolls Palace have that gave them the courage to provoke Soaring Heaven King Palace? Their palace master isn’t that stupid. If he dares to do so, he definitely has a backer. There are only a few of us, it’s best that we don’t act recklessly.”

“How about this? Master Chi Xing happens to be nearby. Let me send him a message for him to make a trip here personally. With Master Chi Xing, no matter who Thunder Rolls Palace’s backer is, he will be able to settle.”

The few experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace nodded heavily at his suggestion.

They were confident in Master Chi Xing.

Then, in the independent room that all experts were paying attention to, the few Real Gods from Thunder Rolls Palace stood. Their faces were as pale as sheets and they were shivering in fear.

“Mister, the one that we offended is Soaring Heaven King Palace,” the master of Thunder Rolls Palace muttered.

In front of the master of Thunder Rolls Palace, there was a young man in a crimson robe carrying a long sword on his back. The person was naturally Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was enjoying his cup of tea leisurely. He smiled when he heard what the master of Thunder Rolls Palace had said. “Why? Master of Thunder Rolls Palace seems to be afraid?”

“Of course I am,” the master of Thunder Rolls Palace said, “Soaring Heaven Jing Palace is one of the biggest forces in Eternal Chaotic World. They have a total of over ten Almighties. Anyone sent could destroy Thunder Rolls Palace completely. On Sea Continent, Soaring Heaven King Place is King. Thunder Rolls Palace have always been respectful.”

The master of Thunder Rolls Palace looked bitter.

Soaring Heaven King Palace was a big figure to Thunder Rolls Palace. If it wasn’t because Jian Wushuang had forced him to, he wouldn’t have had the guts to provoke the former.

But then, he had no choice. The few of their lives were in Jian Wushuang’s hands. They couldn’t even struggle.

They could only obey what Jian Wushuang wanted them to do.

“Don’t worry. Soaring Heaven King Palace isn’t as scary as you imagined. Plus, if the experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace were to barge in here, I would take care of them. As for you, just telling them you were forced by me will do. At most, apologize to them. There won’t be anything major,” Jian Wushuang said.

The master of Thunder Rolls Palace looked even more troubled.

One should know that Soaring Heaven King Palace had always been barbaric. Thunder Rolls Palace had offended them so badly, even if there was a reason, it wouldn’t be something that could be solved with an apology.

“Don’t worry, follow my instructions. Whatever treasure Soaring Heaven King Palace wants, get it for me,” Jian Wushuang continued to enjoy his tea.

The master of Thunder Rolls Palace gulped. Although he wasn’t willing to, he could only follow Jian Wushuang’s instructions. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, Soaring Heaven King Palace seemed to take the hint. The rest of the treasure, they never bid anymore. Hence, the master of Thunder Rolls Palace naturally couldn’t fight for it.

Very soon, the biggest treasure auction on Sea Continent ended.

The experts from various forces and sects walked out from Vientiane Tower. The moment they walked out from Vientiane Tower, they were shocked at the sight in the void before them.

In the void outside of Vientiane Tower, there were over ten figures floating. The figures had strong auras. The weakest was an Eternal Real God and most of them were Chaotic Real Gods. Real God Xue Kong was in the crowd too but he wasn’t the leader of the crowd.

The leader was an elderly with white eyebrows who was standing at the far front with a snakehead staff. He was standing there in silence while he squinted his eyes.

The elderly with white eyebrows didn’t give out any aura. He was the least eye-catching one among the figures. However, that person was the reason the experts at the scene looked terrified.

“It’s Old Monster Chi Xing!”

“Sir God Chi Xing from Soaring Heaven King Palace. He’s an Almighty!”

“An Almighty came personally. Thunder Rolls Palace is doomed!”

“As expected, Soaring Heaven King Palace is not one who could be provoked as he wishes. An Almighty came personally and he could easily destroy Thunder Rolls Palace.

Outside of Vientiane Tower, countless experts stopped. They didn’t leave and the scene became noisy.

Whoever participated in that treasure auction knew that Thunder Rolls Palace had taken the initiative to provoke Soaring Heaven King Palace. According to Soaring Heaven King Palace’s manner of handling things, how could they tolerate that? At the treasure auction earlier, Soaring Heaven King Place didn’t do anything as they were concerned about Vientiane Tower’s reputation. But then… Judging by the looks of it, the moment the experts of Thunder Rolls Palace exit, they would immediately be killed by Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Under the anticipation and attention of all experts, the few Real Gods from Thunder Rolls Palace walked out of Vientiane Tower slowly. The person leading them was the master of Thunder Rolls Palace, who looked bitter.

The moment they walked out from Vientiane Tower, the Master of Thunder Rolls Palace felt dry in his throat when he saw over ten figures and Sir God Chi Xing at the forefront before him. He suppressed his fear and said, “Thunder Rolls Palace, Lei Tao, greets Sir God Chi Xin and everyone from Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

“Lei Tao, in the eyes of your Thunder Rolls Palace, is there Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Real God Xue Kong looked down at him from above.

“This…” the Master of Thunder Rolls Palace wanted to say something.

Sir God Chi Xing’s eyes suddenly opened wide and there was a flash of light.
