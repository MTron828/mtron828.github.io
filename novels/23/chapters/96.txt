Chapter 97: Exchange

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Back at Dragon Palace, Jian Wushuang submitted his tasks.

At Stage One, 2,000 points were awarded.

In Stage Two of the task, Jian Wushuang received 4,000 points for killing four ordinary Dark Silver Guards and 3,000 points for killing the leader of the Dark Silver Guard.

In Stage Three of the task, there were ten Spirit Beasts at the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Each one was worth 1,000 points and so the total points were 10,000.

Therefore Jian Wushuang received a total of 19,000 points after adding up all three stages.

Coupled with the 12,000 points won from the duel with Nangong Jie before, together with his own points, Jian Wushuang had an abundance of points now.

After getting the points, he went to the Secret Pavilion immediately.

In Secret Pavilion, firstly he needed to select a Sword Skill suitable for Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

After picking and choosing, Jian Wushuang selected the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire.

Sword Skill of Blood and Fire was further divided into two volumes and its exchange price was 6,000 points. It was even more expensive than the Formless Sword Wave that he had exchanged for previously.

Subsequently, he received three notebooks again.

These notebooks were left by three strong men who were at the top level of Yin-Yang Void Realm. The three notes had very detailed explanations for Sword Essence of Gale, Sword Essence of Earth and Sword Essence of Raging Fire, and helped Jian Wushuang a lot.

Each one of these three notebooks was as valuable as the Sword Skill, and Jian Wushuang spent 6,000 points to exchange for these three notebooks.

After that, Jian Wushuang began to exchange for some Elixirs.

5,000 points for one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir. He exchanged for three Bottleneck-breaking Elixirs at a time, spending 15,000 points.

5,000 points for one Golden-sun Pill which he redeemed.

Adding this up, it cost him another 20,000 points.

” I thought my points were quite a lot, but now there isn’t much left. ” Jian Wushuang sighed inside.

After all these things had been exchanged, he had only 3,000 points.

But all these things were extremely useful.

Especially the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire and those three notebooks.

Both the Bottleneck-breaking Elixir and the Golden-sun Pill were used to prepare for his breakthrough.

After he swallowed First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill for half a year when he was in the Innumerable Huge Mountains, and coupled with his speed at cultivating due to the Heavenly Creation Skill, his Spiritual Sea had expanded to the extreme and was at the peak of Ultimate Spirit Sea after half a year, with boundless Spiritual Power.

After this step was achieved, the next was to break through to Gold Core by any means.

Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, just as its name implied, was to break the barrier. After swallowing one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, people could quickly touch that barrier, thus they had a chance to achieve a breakthrough.

As for Golden-sun Pill, it was used when making a breakthrough.

After all, there were risks when making a breakthrough, because sometimes the barrier still could not be broken through even if they touched it.

However, the Golden-sun Pill could minimize this risk.

These two kinds of Elixirs, with astonishing high value, were extremely rare in the outside world. Even in the Secret Pavilion, 5,000 points was needed for only one.

At a lofty palace of the Dragon Palace.

“My lord, Swordsman is coming back,” a purple-robed servant of Dragon Palace said.

“Oh?” With brow lifted, Palace Master White said, “Has he finished his experience tasks?”

“Yes.” Purple-robed servant nodded.

“His experience tasks were arranged and carefully selected by me in person. I thought he needed at least one year to finish all these tasks, while it only took him half a year to finish them. Well done,” Palace Master White said with a smile.

She thought highly of Jian Wushuang.

It was because of her high opinion that the arranged experience tasks were more challenging since these tasks for Jian Wushuang were arranged and selected by her in person.

“He received sufficient points this time and should go to the Secret Pavilion to exchange for treasures. What did he exchange?” the Palace Master White asked again.

“This is the list of the treasures he exchanged for.” A purple-robed servant immediately handed over a list.

“Three Bottleneck-breaking Elixirs and a Golden-sun Pill?” Palace Master White nodded slightly, “It seems that he is ready to remove the barrier of reaching Primordial Gold Core.”

“Three sword essence notebooks left by the strong?” Palace Master Whites smiled, with the normal expression.

“Hum?” When she saw the last thing on the list, she frowned.

“Sword Skill of Blood and Fire?”

“People start to study that when they have comprehended Sword Essence of Raging Fire, so why did Swordsman exchange for it?”

Palace Master White knew that Jian Wushuang had comprehended both sword essence of the Gale and the Earth, but he had never comprehended Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

“Comprehending various sword essence at the same time can indeed result in stronger combat power, but everyone has limited energy, and becoming distracted will limit his achievements in the future. I hope this little guy is aware of this.”

“Maybe he exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for someone else?”

Palace Master White secretly thought.

Treasures in the Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace could be exchanged by the disciples of Dragon Palace as long as they had enough points. As for the usage after exchanging, it depended on the disciple, as he could give this Sword Skill to others after he had exchanged for it.

At this moment, Palace Master White also hoped that Jian Wushuang had exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for someone else.

” If he exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for himself, he would be too stupid.”

In the manor, Jian Wushuang had been taken away by Wang Yuan for a drink as soon as he came back.

“The third, took a full six months to complete this time.” Wang Yuan sighed. “Tell me what were your tasks for Stage Two and Stage Three, and why did it take you so long to finish them?”

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang directly told him his tasks and the process briefly.

“F*ck, ten Spirit Beasts of Exceptional Gold Core Realm?” Wang Yu’s eyes widened in shock.

“Ten?” Su Rou could not help gasping in astonishment.

“Have you finished?” Wang Yuan asked again. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Of course, how could I come back without finishing the tasks?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Sh*t, you are too strong,” Wang Yuan smiled and said, “You are just at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm, even without a breakthrough of Gold Core, and you could kill ten Spirit Beasts of Exceptional Gold Core Realm. You are formidable.”

“Just had good luck,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Only he himself knew how hard and arduous it was in the past six months to complete the task of killing ten Spirit Beasts at the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

“And where is the Second?” Jian Wushuang asked.

When he came back, he saw Wang Yuan and Su Rou, without Yang Zaixuan.

“The second’s experience tasks were easier than yours, and he is also so powerful, so it took him only a month to finish all the tasks of three stages. However, he received a new experience task after he just returned Dragon Palace, and he hasn’t come back yet, “Wang Yuan said.

“Another experience task?” Jian Wushuang sighed.

“The second was stimulated by the Earth Dragon List and thus he is cultivating much more than anyone else,” Wang said.

“Earthly Dragon List?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He also longed for a placing on the Earth Dragon List very much, but his strength was still far from it.

“The second works very hard, so I also should work harder,” Jian Wushuang smiled.
