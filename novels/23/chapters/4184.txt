4185 Killing Ruler Horned Flame

“Again! Die!” Ruler Horned Flame raised his head and roared before charging toward Jian Wushuang again!

“Great blazing tyrannical saber technique!!”

Fire snakes slithered out of the giant saber in his hand and followed the saber Light to slash at Jian Wushuang.

On the other side, the divine armor guards, who had returned to their peak strength at the cost of a forbidden technique, stabbed at him with their Broken Spears. This stab was enough to collapse a mountain!

!!

“Hahahaha, good!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang laughed fearlessly. The battle intent in his eyes surged to the extreme and he also burst toward the three people!

The three of them seemed to have turned into three shock waves as they collided together!

“Bang bang bang bang!”

In the blink of an eye, the three of them had exchanged hundreds of moves, causing the void to crack. The aftershocks of their battle created thousands of giant pits on the desolate blood plain.

Under the joint attack of Ruler Horned Flame and the divine armor guards, their battle strength soared instantly. Waves of attacks surged toward Jian Wushuang like the rising tide of the sea.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold. He did not use any super power, but the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand seemed to turn into a storm. Not only did it suppress the attacks of the Ruler Horned Flame and the divine armor guards, but it also had some spare power to bombard them.

The place where the three of them fought formed an isolation zone that was nearly a thousand feet wide. Destructive energies kept intertwining and colliding, and the other Ultimate Rulers could not even get close.

“Kill!”

On the other side, Divine Marquis Qingfeng looked at the remaining dozens of Ultimate Rulers who were ready to escape, and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He raised his halberd and charged forward.

Bang!

Immediately, Divine Marquis Qingfeng turned into a streak of light and stabbed forward like a sharp knife.

Ruler Spear River and the other ten-plus powerful Rulers followed closely behind, charging at the thirty-plus Ultimate Rulers.

The thirty-odd Ultimate Rulers had already lost all their courage from Jian Wushuang’s killing. They had no intention of fighting at all, so Divine Marquis Qingfeng and the others immediately chased after them and killed them.

But at this moment…

In the direction where the Ninth Kalpa King had disappeared, a deafening wild laughter suddenly came from.

“Haha…Blood Nether Emissary, I thought you wouldn’t come. But it’s good that you’ve come at the right time. The Ninth Kalpa King can’t escape now. We can totally suppress him with our combined strength!”

His voice was deafening, and he laughed madly.

The voice came from none other than the Ruler Silver Roc.

Jian Wushuang, who was in the middle of a fierce battle, heard the laughter and his eyes suddenly lit up.

“The people from Blood Sky Palace are here too?” The Ninth Kalpa King mocked Jian Wushuang and he frowned.

Jian Wushuang naturally did not doubt the strength of the Ninth Kalpa King. He was able to compete with an ordinary Supreme.

However, among the people who were fighting with Ninth Kalpa King, the Third Prince and Lord Zhennan were invincible among the Ultimate Rulers. Even in a one-on-one battle, they were only slightly weaker than Ninth Kalpa King. The Ruler Silver Roc was barely invincible among the Ultimate Rulers. The three of them were already difficult to deal with when they joined forces.

But now, the people from Blood Sky Palace had intervened.

When the five blood messengers of Blood Sky Palace joined forces, they would be unrivaled among the Ultimate Rulers. However, there were nine blood messengers in the Tarot Ruins, and they had all arrived.

When the nine Blood Nether Emissaries joined forces, their combat strength would be even more terrifying.

Jian Wushuang could clearly feel that at the place where the Ninth Kalpa King was, after the nine tyrannical divine power Auras barged in, the divine power fluctuation belonging to the Ninth Kalpa King immediately weakened quickly.

Obviously, with the arrival of the nine Blood Nether Emissaries, the Ninth Kalpa King had begun to be suppressed.

“I can’t waste any more time here.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and turned to look at Ruler Horned Flame and the divine armor guards with a cold glint in his eyes.

“Haha…the Royal Highness and the others are about to defeat the Ninth Kalpa King. When they are free, I’ll see if you’re dead or not!” The divine armor guards noticed the change in the situation of the Ninth Kalpa King’s battlefield in the distance. They could not help but show a look of ecstasy and laugh.

“I don’t know if I’ll die or not, but the two of you won’t be able to live.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and sent the divine armor guard flying with his broken spear. At the same time, his eyes turned cold.

Innate divine power, original universe.

“Innate divine ability, life intimidation!”

In an instant, the two great innate abilities appeared at the same time. First, a profound aura of the laws of the universe descended, and the world instantly darkened.

It was pitch-black and there was no light.

The divine armor guards and Ruler Horned Flame’s power were both affected to a certain extent by the boundless darkness.

Immediately after, the life intimidation effect was triggered, and a suppressing force from a Supreme life form instantly descended. It was a pressure from the depths of the soul that came from a high-level creature to a low-level creature!

Time seemed to have frozen at that moment. The divine armor guards and the Ruler Horned Flame froze. Under the effect of life intimidation, they looked at Jian Wushuang and had the urge to worship him.

What…what kind of method is this?!!

The two of them were like water buffaloes that had fallen into a swamp. They turned their heads with difficulty to look at each other, and they could see the shock on each other’s faces!

As for Jian Wushuang, he had already charged forward with his sword.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold as he stabbed his sword into the Ruler Horned Flame’s chest. Then, a sharp and terrifying sword essence burst forth from the Wuqi Divine Sword. The sword essence also contained an unprecedented killing power.

Crash! Ruler Horned Flame was also wearing true treasure armor, but it was not of a very high level. Although it was a top-tier mid-grade law true treasure, it wasn’t at the level of an upper-grade law true treasure.

Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword, on the other hand, had already surpassed the category of an upper-grade law true treasure and reached the extreme of a law true treasure. In terms of level, it was much higher than the true treasure armor of Ruler Horned Flame.

Thus, the moment the sword-intent within Wu Qi exploded forth, the true treasure armor on the surface of Ruler Horned Flame’s body was instantly torn apart. The terrifying sword-intent continued to attack Ruler Horned Flame’s divine body.

In an instant, Ruler Horned Flame’s divine body was ground to dust, and his divine power was completely obliterated.

Bang!

With an explosion, the first general under the Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, Ruler Horned Flame, died!

An ordinary life form has limited divine power. Once a true treasure armor is forcefully torn apart, the power of my sword principle will be enough to kill him instantly. Even if he’s a top-tier Ultimate Ruler, he’ll still die. Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he looked at the supreme treasures left behind by Ruler Horned Flame. He could not help but smile coldly.
