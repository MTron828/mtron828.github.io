Chapter 1093: Dead!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Quick, Silver Moon! Run over to us. Just hold on for two more breaths! Just two more breaths and Void Temple Master will…”

Celestial Master Yu Ding spoke in a loud voice in hopes that it would reach Celestial Master Silver Moon’s ears. However, before he could finish his words, he heard a soft groan and later saw Silver Moon fallingfeebly to the ground.

The scene was devastating for both Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding.

“Yu Ding, I’ll turn off the Restriction on Tai Qing Palace now so that you and Jian Wushuang can rescue her. Remember to be careful…” Void Temple Master’s reply came as soon as he received their message.

Yu Ding sighed. “Don’t bother, Void Temple Master.”

Void Temple Master fell silent.

He realized that there could only be one implication of Yu Ding’s words: Silver Moon had passed away.

“Alas!”

Void Temple Master suspended their communication after heaving a sigh.

“There were 139 Celestial Masters in Green Fire Palace. Now they’ve lost another.” Yu Ding shook his head.

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands with a grim expression.

Though he had never spoken to Silver Moon, both of them were members of Green Fire Palace and comrades who had fought for the Green Fire World at the risk of their lives.

It was a terrible thing to watch a comrade fall before his eyes without being able to do anything about it.

“Jin Kingdom!” Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth.

Suddenly…

“Hm?” Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding looked up at the same time. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They saw three Jin Kingdom experts carry Silver Moon’s body to the front of Tai Qing Palace after killing her.

The experts stared at Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding through the transparent Restriction. Then, the one carrying Silver Moon’s body flung her at them. Silver Moon’s body traveled like a Flowing Light before hitting the Restriction around the palace.

“Bang!”

The Jin Kingdom expert exerted such enormous strength that Silver Moon’s body shattered and turned into a bloody mist.

Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding’s teeth chattered when they witnessed this.

“Bastard!”

Yu Ding cursed loudly.

Jian Wushuang’s Killing Intent soared.

“Hum, are you the coward of Green Fire Palace?”

The leader of the three Jin Kingdom experts, an advanced Celestial Master, sneered. “Our monarch has ordered us not to trouble you as long as you stay inside Green Fire Palace. However, we’re free to kill if any of you step onto the battlefield!”

Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding were livid.

“Pissed off, aren’t you?”

“If you’ve got guts, why don’t you turn off the Restriction, come out, and fight us three?” the advanced Celestial Master taunted.

Suddenly…

“Clang!”

A dazzling light burst out of the wormhole in Tai Qing Palace.

10 people rushed out of the wormhole amidst the flickering light.

Simultaneously, the Restriction around Tai Qing Palace was turned off.

“Shit!”

“Let’s run!”

“Hurry and run!”

The three Jin Kingdom experts immediately ran when they saw the flaring light, completely forgetting how they had just taunted Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding.

Since they were genuine Celestial Masters with decent speed, they managed to flee quite the distance and outran the experts coming out of the wormhole.

“Bastards of the Jin Kingdom!”

“They’re lucky that they fled quickly. Otherwise…”

“How I wish to kill the three bastards!”

Voices filled with rage sounded one after another.

Ten people of both genders and varying ages towered over Tai Qing Palace, each of them emanating a great aura.

They were evidently the Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace.

They had learned of Silver Moon’s predicament through the communication between Yu Ding and Void Temple Master. Those close to her rushed over through the wormhole.

However, they were too late.

When they stared at the bloody mist that Silver Moon’s body had disintegrated into, they could still see a little of her bones, blood, and flesh. Their expressions were ghastly.

They all lived such long lives that they had lost all of their families. Nothing in the Green Fire World were of concern to them, except for their Green Fire Palace comrades who had risked their lives in the fight against the Jin Kingdom.

Silver Moon was one of their comrades. Naturally, her death pained them.

“Yu Ding, you were here when Silver Moon was killed. Why didn’t you save her?”a bald elder asked, nearly snarling.

“I wanted to but the Restriction was still there. I’ve immediately requested Void Temple Master to turn it off but just as he replied, Silver Moon died. What else could I do?” Yu Ding replied in a low voice.

Though the bald elder was still angry, he did not vent it on Yu Ding any longer after hearing the latter’s story.

“According to Yu Ding, the Jin Kingdom experts probably ambushed Silver Moon. They injured and killed her before she could get help. If she sensed danger and got Void Temple Master to turn off the Restriction earlier, she wouldn’t have died,” a petite and short young man said with a sigh.

Though he looked young, his head was a shock of silver-white hair.

He was the only one in the Exceptional Realm among the dozen Celestial Masters present, as well as the most senior one. His name was Chen.

Following the short period of grief, the rest finally calmed down.

Chen suddenly turned to look at Jian Wushuang. “Yu Ding, will you introduce your friend…”

The rest also looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

They could see that Jian Wushuang was a mere Eternal Realm expert.

“This is Jian Wushuang, also a member of Green Fire Palace. Though he’s still in the Eternal Realm, he has reached the top of the Three-star Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God. He also possesses a number of trump cards and great battle strength. Hence he can rival ordinary medium-level Celestial Masters,” Yu Ding replied. “I’ve come here to take him to Tai Qing Palace.”

“Oh?” Chen and the others were surprised.

Jian Wushuang saluted them and said humbly, “Nice to meet you, Celestial Masters.”

Naturally, he had to be a little more humble when meeting these Celestial Masters who were like old monsters who had lived countless years.
