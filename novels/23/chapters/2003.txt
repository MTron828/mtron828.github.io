Chapter 2004: Dark Millstone

All Great Emperors were watching closely.

They saw the huge black steel ball roll over everything like breaking pieces of deadwood. It even crushed the holy kingdom into pieces.

The Great Emperors’ gazes became terrified.

It was really an astonishing sight.

One should know how spacious a holy kingdom was and how many the cultivators were there.

Even those Great Emperors, although they had absolute power and they could definitely destroy a holy kingdom, their destruction was limited to taking out the higher-ups only. As for killing all cultivators in the territories of the holy kingdom, although they would be able to do it, it would require a long time.

After all, even if a Great Emperor were to destroy the world one by one, a holy kingdom was made up of thousands of worlds. It would take long enough to be entirely wiped out.

The biggest possibility was to send the experts under their control and they would be able to make a holy kingdom disappear in a very short time.

But then, the black steel ball was much fiercer. It didn’t have any scruples but a holy kingdom had vanished straight away after it had rolled over. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Red Dragon, what is going on? Where did this thing come from?” Abysmal Saint Master creased his eyebrows and looked at him.

The other Great Emperors looked solemn too.

They could tell how terrifying and powerful the black steel ball was.

Red Dragon King took a deep breath and answered seriously, “What the thing is, where the thing is from, remains unknown for now. Emperor Bai, Tian Chen and I named this thing earlier. We called it a dark millstone.

“Dark millstone?” The Great Emperors nodded simultaneously.

The black steel ball crushed everything along the way. It was really like a huge millstone. On top of that, its body was all black. Hence, it was best suited to the name dark millstone.

“According to the information that Sanctuary Alliance gathered, the dark millstone first appeared at the Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fire and it had descended from the sky above. From the crack in the void above the Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fire, it had expanded and then destroyed the Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fire. Then, the dark millstone had started moving towards other holy kingdoms.

“Until now, besides the Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fire that the dark millstone first landed on, it passed two other holy kingdoms and both holy kingdoms shared the same outcome as the Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fire. They were crushed to pieces and countless cultivators didn’t even stand a chance of escape.”

“Then, the dark millstone was still moving around,” Red Dragon King sounded solemn.

The Great Emperors were astonished at the news.

There were three holy kingdoms that had vanished into thin air in such a short period of time.

The dark millstone was so terrifying!

“Not only that.”

An old voice was heard from Ancestor Tian Chen. Then, Ancestor Tian Chen also looked unprecedentedly solemn. “At the very moment I received the news, I immediately sent an Emperor God from Sanctuary Alliance who was nearby to check on the dark millstone. The Emperor God just sent me an update that the dark millstone is constantly growing in size and power as it moves around!”

“What?” The Great Emperors’ faces grew grave.

The dark millstone was already so terrifying, but it was still constantly growing in size and power?

“The dark millstone had to be destroyed this instant!” A Great Emperor said.

“Yes, we have to destroy it now. Worse comes to worst, we have to stop it.”

“It crushed three holy kingdoms in such a short period of time. Although there are many holy kingdoms in Eternal Chaotic World, we still couldn’t afford to be tormented like that.

“If the dark millstone couldn’t be destroyed, the entire Eternal Chaotic World would be doomed!!”

The other Great Emperors commented.

They could see how threatening the dark millstone was.

It was a great threat. If it wasn’t destroyed anytime soon, it would absolutely cause great danger.

In the end, the dark millstone might even wipe out the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

“Ancestor Tian Chen, did any of our Great Emperor from Sanctuary Alliance try to destroy the dark millstone?” Jian Wushuang asked. He looked extremely solemn.

Ancestor Tian Chen looked at Jian Wushuang and nodded faintly, “When Sanctuary Alliance received the news, there was a Great Emperor who tried and the Great Emperor is Emperor Bai himself!”

“Emperor Bai?”

The Great Emperors around the round table looked at Emperor Bai, who hadn’t spoken since the very beginning.

Emperor Bai was the strongest one in Sanctuary Alliance.

He took action personally…

“What happened?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“He failed,” Ancestor Tian Chen let out a sigh.

“How is this possible?” The Great Emperors were taken by surprise.

Emperor Bai took action personally, but he couldn’t break the dark millstone.

Then, Emperor Bai spoke, “The dark millstone isn’t simple. Not only did it contain terrifying power that could destroy everything, there was also a great formation on its surface. The great formation is very magical, very powerful. Its defense power was unbelievable. The defense power of the great formation continuously improved as the dark millstone moved.”

“I think the great formation on the surface of the dark millstone and its setup is not any weaker than the one around the ancient battlefield that merged together with spacetime storm.”

Everyone was shocked once again.

Jian Wushuang was shocked too.

The great formation around the ancient battlefield was created by his master, Xuan Yi.

The great formation could be described as earth-shattering. It was an absolutely unbelievable skill.

However, the great formation on the surface of the dark millstone could compare favorably with the formation that merged with spacetime storm?

Although it was merely Emperor Bai’s personal opinion and there might be a discrepancy, it was enough to show how powerful the great formation around the dark millstone was.

“There is such a powerful great formation set up around the dark millstone? Couldn’t it be that the dark millstone is controlled by someone?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze exclaimed in surprise.

Everyone went quiet when they heard her comment.

Everyone had already thought of the possibility.

The great formation was definitely set up by someone.

As there was a great formation around the dark millstone, it meant that someone was controlling the dark millstone and that person was most likely in the dark millstone.

“In Eternal Chaotic World, only the two dark forces, Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace, have the ability to produce the dark millstone and do such a thing,” Emperor Bai said in a deep voice, “For the past years, the two dark forces had been preparing to attack. I predicted that they would do something major in these few years and it happened as expected!!”

“Now that they have made the dark millstone, if Sanctuary Alliance doesn’t figure out a way to destroy it or stop it, the entire Eternal Chaotic World will be destroyed!”

“This crisis is a great danger and Eternal Chaotic World’s existence is at stake!”
