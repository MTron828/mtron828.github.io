1934 Spacetime Gap

King Demon Heart saw that there was no sign of stopping in Jian Wushuang action and he panicked. He immediately took out a token.

Pak!

King Demon Heart immediately smashed the token and roared, “Great Emperor Zi Xu, save me! Jian Wushuang wants to kill me!”

The token belonged to Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Theoretically, when a token was smashed, Great Emperor Zi Xu’s consciousness incarnation should descend.

Although it was just a consciousness incarnation, Jian Wushuang had to show respect when a Great Emperor made an appearance.

At least, that was what King Demon Heart thought.

However, he had never expected that there would be no movement at all after the token was smashed.

There were no changes in the entire secret room. Great Emperor Zi Xu’s consciousness incarnation… didn’t come?

“How is it possible?”

“Why didn’t Great Emperor Zi Xu’s consciousness incarnation descend?”

“Could Great Emperor be cultivating in seclusion?”

“Impossible, impossible!”

King Demon Heart felt hopeless then.

If Great Emperor Zi Xu’s consciousness incarnation were to be second, he might have had a string of hope.

However, without Great Emperor Zi Xu’s consciousness incarnation, Jian Wushuang naturally wouldn’t delay further.

Jian Wushuang’s palm rose and there was a resplendent golden light that appeared from nowhere.

The golden light was the Hong Jun Golden Sword.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the resplendent golden light burst out.

“No!” King Demon Heart’s face changed. He knew Jian Wushuang was powerful and he also knew the terrifying Hong Jung Golden Sword.

Although it was only one Hong Jun Golden Sword, it would still be like slaughtering a chicken to kill him.

“Sword Emperor, don’t kill me. I was only following orders to scheme against Real God Wu Bei back then.”

“Real God Wu Bei’s death wasn’t my intention. It was Great Emperor Zi Xu’s. Great Emperor Zi Xu wanted me to scheme against Real God Wu Bei!!!”

King Demon Heart roared from the bottom of his heart.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t bother about his roaring. The resplendent golden light didn’t pause and spread at a terrifying speed and pierced King Demon Heart’s skull.

Before King Demon Heart died, his eyes were wide-open and there was unwillingness on his face.

Jian Wushuang stood on the spot and waved. Then, the Hong Jun Golden Sword flew back next to him and he put it in Qian Kun ring.

Looking at King Demon Heart’s cold, dead body, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“King Demon Heart was really Great Emperor Zi Xu’s man. Rumor had it that Great Emperor Zi Xu did owe King Demon Heart a favor. However, when King Demon Heart had asked him for help earlier, he hadn’t cared and he hadn’t bothered descending in consciousness incarnation either,” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

Great Emperor Zi Xu, a super expert on the fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had had scruples. Hence, he had never once attacked King Demon Heart.

But then… Lineage of Star was at peace and he had many trump cards on hand. On top of that, Emperor Thirteen had made an appearance to save him previously. Hence, Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World had scruples. As a result, Jian Wushuang had no scruples to attack King Demon Heart.

Before he had come, Jian Wushuang had already made preparations to deal with Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Once Great Emperor Zi Xu appeared in consciousness incarnation, Jian Wushuang would continue to kill King Demon Heart.

He believed that Great Emperor wouldn’t fall out with him or even fight with him because of the King Demon Heart.

But he had never expected that Great Emperor Zi Xu wouldn’t even reveal himself. He didn’t even descend in consciousness incarnation but had let him kill King Demon Heart.

“What is Great Emperor Zi Xu thinking?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

Besides, Jian Wushuang was surprised at whatever King Demon Heart had said earlier.

The one who had schemed against Real God Wu Bei back then wasn’t King Demon Heart but Great Emperor Zi Xu?

Was it a joke?

A Great Emperor, why would he scheme against Real God Wu Bei out of nowhere?

“Regardless, I’ve done whatever I promised Real God Wu Bei. I already killed King Demon Heart. As for if it involved Great Emperor Zi Xu…” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “Forget about the fact that it was only King Demon Heart’s comment alone, it might not be real. Even if it was real, I couldn’t do anything about a Great Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head but didn’t think further. He then turned to leave.

However, he didn’t know that at that very moment, on the boat that was drifting on the river at the estate that was like human paradise, the lazy man who was fishing on the boat, Great Emperor Zi Xu, was smiling, “Jian Wushuang came personally to kill Demon Heart?”

“It seems like it is because of Real God Wu Bei.”

“It’s just Demon Heart. So what if you kill him? I will let you off the hook this time. I hope it ends here.”

The lazy man smiled and continued to fish.

…

Just as Jian Wushuang was on the way to Holy Kingdom of Demon Heart to kill King Demon Heart.

In ancient mystery land.

The ancient mystery land that originally opened once every five million years and opens for ten thousand years each time, it still wasn’t closing after it had reached the ten thousand year limit.

As all the experts in Eternal Chaotic World were surprised, they were also filled with excitement. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

One should know that ancient mystery land contained many opportunities.

After all these years, there had been many experts that had gone into ancient mystery land to look for an opportunity again.

Emperor God Xie Xin was only an Emperor God on the bottom rank among all Emperor Gods in Eternal Chaotic World.

His power was ordinary and he hadn’t had much luck all this while.

Every since ancient mystery land opened, he had been wandering in ancient mystery land. Previously, when he had wandered for the given limit of ten thousand years, he hadn’t received any good opportunity. But then, when he entered ancient mystery land to wander, he had finally found a strange land after a few thousand years.

“I never expected that there would be a space-time gap hidden under the ruin! This is so secretive!”

Emperor God Xie Xin’s eyes were shimmering when he saw the spacetime gap before him.

The spacetime gap gave him a feeling that it was like a spacetime tunnel. He had no idea where the other side of the gap was.

It might be a dangerous land, but it might also be an opportunity.

He wasn’t confident.

“Wealth comes from danger. Let’s bet!”

Emperor God Xie Xin clenched his teeth. He had finally made up his mind after being in deep thought for very long.

He moved and immersed himself in the spacetime gap. He disappeared very quickly.

When he appeared again…

Vroom!!

Emperor God Xie Xin appeared in an entirely different universe.

Looking at the situation, he was still on an ancient battlefield. Emperor God Xie Xin wouldn’t recognize the ancient aura wrongly.

However, the ancient battlefield was obviously different from the ancient battlefield in ancient mystery land.

“The spiritual influence of heaven and earth here… is so abundant!”

“It’s abundant! The intensity of it might be at least ten times stronger than Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!”

“How could there be a place so filled with spiritual influence of heaven and earth?”

“Where is this place? Is it still in ancient mystery land?”

Emperor God Xie Xin was confused.

However, he knew that the place that he was at was definitely extremely different from ancient mystery land.

Emperor God Xie Xin immediately started probing the surroundings.

However, if he could put his soul power over everything around him, he would realize that he had come to another ancient battlefield.

The ancient battlefield was much bigger and more spacious than the ancient battlefield in ancient mystery land.

Plus, the battlefield was engulfed in a huge spacetime storm.

At the core of the battlefield, there was a huge, boundless skull that would shock everyone.

At the core of the skull, there was a huge world.

That huge world was Green Fire World!!!
