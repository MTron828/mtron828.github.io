Chapter 1118: Massacre for Military Glory

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A frenetic massacre unfolded on the battlefield.

There were too many experts who had been drawn here by the birth of the Loyalty Palace.

Forty-two alone came from the Green Fire Palace. There were even more who hailed from the Jin Kingdom.

Experts from both camps summed up to more than one hundred Celestial Master experts. They all participated in this chaotic battle.

There was already a deep grudge between the two camps in the first place. Naturally, their battle was even more ferocious.

Moreover, the number of Life Medicine pellets was only a little over a hundred. Many of the Celestial Masters got their hands on them with minimal effort after they flew out of the Loyalty Palace. Now that all the pellets were gone, the ferocious battle gradually subsided.

On the battlefield, experts from both camps had mostly stopped fighting.

There were only two figures clashing fiercely in the middle of the battlefield.

These two were none other than Jian Wushuang and the tall and sturdy old man who was a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm.

Someone whose battle prowess had reached Jian Wushuang’s level would naturally be incredibly swift. In the blink of an eye, he and the old man had already exchanged hundreds of blows.

“Clang!”

Once again, an earth-shattering collision resounded. It was only then that the two of them finally separated from each other.

Jian Wushuang hovered high up in the Void, his breath still boundless and his battle intent overwhelming. His eyes glinted as he stared at the tall and sturdy old man.

The old man’s face finally turned a little pale and there was even a faint blood stain on the corner of his mouth. In his eyes were unbridled anger.

When the experts from both camps saw this, they were deeply stunned.

“How is this possible?”

“That’s a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm! Jian Wushuang managed to hurt him without getting injured himself?”

“How is this possible? This must be a joke!”

The Celestial Masters of the Green Fire Palace were all dumbfounded.

They were all familiar with Jian Wushuang and knew that when he first arrived, he possessed the battle prowess of a medium-level Celestial Master. However, they were hostile to him because of his mother.

Yet now… It hadn’t even been that long since he first arrived in the Green Fire Palace!

Was a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm also helpless against him?

Even a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm was injured after a battle with him?

“Impossible!” The Jin Kingdom experts were also astonished and in great disbelief.

“This damned junior!” The tall and sturdy old man trembled as fiery hatred burned in his eyes. He felt incredibly sullen.

Yes, he was sullen!

If Jian Wushuang had depended solely on his strength to injure him, then he must admit that Jian Wushuang’s strength was above his.

However, the clincher was that Jian Wushuang’s strength wasn’t at all above his!

Jian Wushuang was indeed weaker than him.

Even Jian Wushuang himself concede this point.

Even though his strength had increased sharply ever since he elevated his three Sword Principles to the Creation Level, it was barely enough to put him on par with a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm. In a true battle, he was most certainly at a disadvantage.

Even though he has tried his best in the fierce battle with the robust elder, he was still at a disadvantage.

The reason for such a development was because Jian Wushuang still insisted on confronting the old man who was putting everything on the line. In a head-on collision, the old man was naturally unafraid.

In their exchange of blows, the aftermath of their attacks was equally devastating and affected them both. The only difference was that the old man received far less impact from the aftershock.

However, Jian Wushuang’s defensive measures defied heaven itself!

Even though the aftershock was incredibly powerful, it couldn’t injure him in the slightest. On the other hand, the comparatively lighter aftershock that the old man suffered ended up hurting him.

“This brat is clearly weaker than me but his defense is far superior to mine!” the burly old man muttered, clasping his hands.

The battlefield came to a complete standstill after Jian Wushuang and the burly old man ceased fighting.

The two camps of experts began determining their respective losses, as well as that of their enemies.

The Jin Kingdom experts flew into a rage once they found their answer.

“Impossible! How could this happen?”

“There were more than sixty experts from our Jin Kingdom; we have at least twenty more than the Green Fire Palace! The quality of our experts is better too! Logically speaking, we clearly had the upper hand and the number of our fallen peers should be lower than theirs. Yet why… why did our Jin Kingdom lose so many Celestial Masters?” another Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm from the Jin Kingdom roared.

Other Jin Kingdom experts experienced the same level of fury.

On the other side, the Green Fire Palace experts were stupefied.

Under ordinary circumstances, their side ought to suffer more devastating results than the Jin Kingdom. However, reality proved differently.

After a quick calculation, they determined that they had lost thirteen Celestial Masters. This was most certainly a great loss for them.

The loss of the Jin Kingdom was somehow greater. They had lost more than twenty nine Celestial Masters! One more and that would make up a whopping thirty of them.

“How did it turn out this way?”

“Just what exactly is going on?”

Voices imbued with anger came from the group of Jin Kingdom experts. In the next moment, they all turned to look at the young man who wore a blood-soaked robe and carried a scarlet longsword —Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him!”

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s him who bulldozed through the battlefield and ruthlessly slaughtered our experts!”

“I was near him earlier and saw very clearly how he, from the beginning of the battle, mercilessly slaughtered some twenty of our Celestial Master experts! Had Old Wu not stop him, I don’t know how many more of our experts would die in his hands! He’s the reason why we’re suffering such a massive loss!”

“Jian Wushuang!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s all because of him!”

“It’s this bastard who single-handedly exterminated twenty of our Jin Kingdom experts in a short time!”

Furious glares, one after another, burned upon Jian Wushuang.

These angry remarks dumbfounded the Green Fire Palace experts.

Single-handedly exterminated twenty of the Jin Kingdom experts in a short time?

Jian Wushuang did that?

Jian Wushuang’s robe billowed in the air and his already-red Blood Mountain Sword turned a darker shade after absorbing all of his enemies’ blood. There was still blood dripping from the tip of the sword blade.

On his handsome and cold face was a pair of steely eyes. The killing aura that enveloped him remained as overpowering as ever.

“From today onward, your name will strike fear in both the Green Fire Palace and Jin Kingdom experts!” Gu King’s solemn voice resounded inside Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“You’ve developed your reputation from this ruthless massacre!”

“Your massacre today will certainly be a bloody myth in the Green Fire Palace!”
