“Haha. He made a breakthrough.” Wang Yuan immediately stood up, laughing brightly and loudly.

“He has a Gold Core aura…” Su Rou was stunned because she perceived something unusual. Although Jian Wushuang just made a breakthrough, the Gold Core Aura concealed in his body was more powerful than warriors In the Profound Gold Core Realm.

As usual, if Jian Wushuang didn’t actively exhale it, ordinary people couldn’t feel it. But Su Rou could perceive it because of her special circumstances.

Therefore, she was very astonished.

“He is only in the Initial Gold Core Realm, so how could his Gold Core aura be so powerful?” Although it seemed strange, Su Rou wasn’t going to ask about it.

After a brief pause, Jian Wushuang walked over.

“Come on, Third Brother. Have a drink.” Wang Yuan promptly took out some good wine.

Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse this time. He directly took the glass, looked at it, then drank it.

“That’s great. Not only did you reach the Gold Core Realm, you also passed the Eleventh Level of the Dragon Gate. I believe that nobody would dare to make trouble for me in the whole Dragon Palace, because of you,” said Wang Yuan while laughing loudly.

Wang Yuan was less respected in Dragon Palace because of his weak strength.

But now, things would change.

Like the old saying “Tall trees provide the best shade.” Apparently, Jian Wushuang had become a tall tree.

“Third Brother.” Su Rou was about to say something, but she stopped.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang looked at her.

“Would you do me a favor?” Su Rou asked.

“What do you need help with?” Jian Wushuang asked, then slightly smiled.

They were like family to him, so Jian Wushuang was frank and treated them sincerely. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Fourth Sister, Su Rou, was a woman of few words with an introverted and delicate character, she would never shrink back at a crucial moment.

Su Rou and Yang Zaixuan had stepped forward to assist Jian Wushuang when he was forced to compete with Su Lie.

As family, what they did made Jian Wushuang feel grateful.

Thus, he would not decline them if they turned to him for help.

“I received news two days ago that a Black Water Lotus was found in the Endless mountain range. It will be completely mature in a few days. The Black Water Lotus is useful to me,” Su Rou said.

“Black Water Lotus?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued by it.

He had also heard that the Black Water Lotus was a very rare Natural Treasure.

Not only could the Black Water Lotus be used to refine pills, It had an even more important use. It could breed Black Water Lotus Seeds, which would be an immeasurable help when trying to comprehend Essense of the Waterdrop.

It was said that if, while comprehending Essense of the Waterdrop, one absorbed the Black Water Lotus Seed, they would greatly improve their comprehension in Essence of the Waterdrop.

In Tianzong Dynasty, many warriors who studied Essense of the Waterdrop were willing to pay a high price to procure a Black Water Lotus Seed.

“Do you want the Black Water Lotus Seed to help you comprehend Sword Essence of the Waterdrop?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No. I want the Black Water Lotus instead of its seed,” Su Rou replied.

What she said surprised Jian Wushuang.

The seed was the most valuable part of the Black Water Lotus. As for the Black Water Lotus itself, it was actually useless. Logically, she should be striving for the seed to help her comprehend Essence of the Waterdrop.

But she cared more about the Black Water Lotus. Why?

“The Black Water Lotus is very valuable in Tianzong Dynasty. Many warriors who meditate on Essence of the Waterdrop are very eager to get it. So, once the Black Water Lotus blooms, many experts will struggle for it,” Su Rou said.

“My cultivation has reached the Profound Gold Core Realm, and my comprehension is pretty good. However, I’m not confident I can acquire it in front of all those people.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

“Do you want me to help you fight for the Black Water Lotus?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Su Rou nodded. “I had thought that I should turn to Second Brother for help when he came back, or ask some strong disciples of Dragon Palace for assistance. But now that you have made a breakthrough into the Gold Core Realm…”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang laughed and then asked, “When will we leave?”

Su Rou was delighted and replied, ” In two days.”

” Okay. I will go with you,” Jian Wushuang promised at once.

Though Jian Wushuang promised Su Rou, he was a little curious. Why did she have no interest in the seed but care so much about the Black Water Lotus?

…

Two days later, Jian Wushuang and Su Rou departed.

When they walked through Dragon Palace, the disciples of Dragon Palace couldn’t help looking at Jian Wushuang.

“That is Swordsman!”

“What a monster!”

“Is he going outside to train?”

“I heard that he reached the Gold Core Realm.”

The disciples of Dragon Palace were discussing Jian Wushuang, but without being envious.

After all, when a person’s strength greatly exceeded their imagination and reached an incredible level, they would naturally feel respect instead of envy.

Now, they realized that compared with Jian Wushuang’s strength, It was like they were in two totally different worlds.

So why compete with him?

Outside Dragon Palace, two Golden-armored Sergeants, riding Griffins, were already waiting for them.

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then he left on a Griffin, heading towards the Endless mountain range with Su Rou.

Nobody knew that as soon as Jian Wushuang left, Bai Cheng reported it to Blood Feather Tower.

In a dim study, an old man in gray sat on a chair with two purple-masked assassins standing respectfully in front of him.

“Jian Wushuang has left Dragon Palace.” The old man in gray raised his head, looking directly at them in a cold manner.

“It is said that Jian Wushuang has passed the Eleventh Level of Dragon Gate, which shocked the whole Dragon Palace. And now he has even formed his Primordial Gold Core!”

“What’s more, he is 17 this year.”

Bang!

The old man in gray heavily slapped the desk, which made the green wooden desk break into pieces. He suddenly stood up and burst out with a raging voice.

“A 17-year-old with a Primordial Gold Core!”

“A 17-year-old man who passed the Eleventh Level of the Dragon Gate!”

“How could he progress so fast?”

“If he keeps making progress at such speed, he will easily destroy Blood Feather Tower in a few years.”

When hearing this, the two purple-masked assassins who were standing there respectfully began to tremble.

“Listen. Collect as much intelligence as you can. Find out where he is going. Find him!”

“The First and Second Squad of Blood Shadow are on call. Once you find Jian Wushuang, you must immediately kill him, regardless of the cost.”

“This time, definitely, do not give him any chances!”

“If he escapes again, everyone involved in this mission, including both of you, will be executed.

The old man in gray had an extremely cold expression. His killing intent shrouded the whole room with an ice cold feeling.

After hearing that, both of the purple-masked assassins couldn’t help swallowing, then they immediately left.
