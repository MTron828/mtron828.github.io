Chapter 5428 Hu Qing's Dao

If it were a peak-level tier 6, it might have made him somewhat wary, but a top-level one was easily suppressed with a casual move.

Jian Wushuang was also aware that what he lacked was bargaining chips. He spoke up, "Island Lord, don't you want to know why I can help the Bai Juwnang enter the body of the Universe Master?"

"Hmm?" Gui Ling was momentarily stunned. He almost forgot that it was Jian Wushuang who assisted Bai Junwang in entering the body of the Universe Master.

This fact was undeniable, especially the peculiar force erupting from Jian Wushuang's body, which could aid the tier 6 Emperor in recovering his combat power.

"As long as Island Lord is willing to cooperate, I may not be of much help in future battles, but I guarantee there won't be any issue in restoring everyone's Origin Source," Jian Wushuang assured.

Turtle Spirit Island Lord, however, was somewhat disdainful, saying indifferently, "Capturing you can achieve the same!"

"Island Lord, feel free to try. I still have the courage for that!" Jian Wushuang's eyes were resolute. Capture him? Highly unlikely.

After a brief standoff, Jian Wushuang and Turtle Spirit Island Lord eventually reached an agreement. The treasures were distributed on a one-to-nine basis, with Gui Ling's side having the first pick, leaving the rest to Jian Wushuang.

This essentially severed Jian Wushuang's opportunity this time.

However, merely preserving his life was already good enough, and he dared not have too many expectations.

Survive first, and then consider everything else in the long run.

Situ Nan and the others did not want to stir up conflicts again, but when they looked at Jian Wushuang, there was a hint of killing intent in their eyes.

Naturally, they didn't believe that Jian Wushuang and the others were from some force in the Inner Sea.

Although they confronted the Shadow Sect in the Celestial Realm, they also had some understanding of the Kui Organization in the Earth Realm. Both were part of the same force.

Three forces transformed into two, facing off once again.

Now, the path ahead was blocked by Hu Qing, with Zhen Wuyang and others guarding the way, leaving them with no choice but to wait.

Jian Wushuang was also curious about whether Huiqing could succeed.

Their relationship was good, so there was no need to arrange for the Turtle Spirit Island Lord to interfere.

In the radiance, Hu Qing and Jiang Shang sat facing each other.

"Master!" Jiang Shang looked at Hu Qing, her eyes flickering.

She was protecting the way for Hu Qing, helping him integrate his Dao.

Jiang Shang, who had become an Emperor, had never walked his path before, and even the concept of the Dao was vague to her.

Calling her an Emperor was more of a physical classification, but she seemed more like a commoner in essence.

The Spirit of Grass and Wood around her was equivalent to her Origin Source Dao, capable of condensing into a spiritual sense of the Origin Source, a uniqueness in itself.

A naive child hovered around the two.

Hu Qing clasped his hands together, motionless. Integrate the Dao!

As the name suggested, it was about integrating one's Dao with space, merging with the spatial origin, ultimately stepping into the ranks of Emperors.

Hu Qing had ample luck, increasing the probability of successfully harmonizing the path.

The Ultimate Dao, Zen Mechanism.

It was elusive, unlike Jian Wushuang's Sword Dao that was tangible.

Zen was more like the heavenly way, closely related to time.

It was not easy to merge with space.

The Dao of Zen wafted through Hu Qing's space, lingering without merging.

Because there was already a Dao within the space, the

original heavenly Dao of that space, Hu Qing had to suppress it first before integrating his Zen Mechanism into the space.

As the saying goes, two tigers cannot share one mountain; how could there be a second Heavenly Dao in one space?

The Origin Source of Zen took on the form of Hu Qing, floating in the silent space.

"Virtuous!"

The cycle of the Heavenly Dao, having long mastered the Origin Source of space, unexpectedly turned out to be a disadvantage.

If he had only just grasped the Origin Source of space now, the Heavenly Dao inside would probably be equally formidable.

However, his spatial Origin Source had already reached the level of extreme balance between Yin and Yang, containing a unique Heavenly Dao within.

He hadn't anticipated that he would encounter the opportunity to integrate the Dao so soon after arriving here.

Originally, he thought he would need to delve deeper into the ruins.

But unexpectedly, after exiting the black hole, he found himself on a lotus platform by a spiritual spring on Lingtai Mountain. It seemed as if this place had been specially prepared for him.

Various assisting treasures, coupled with a trace of the temporal Origin Dao, were precisely what he lacked the most.

By merging all the treasures and comprehending time, he embarked on the most crucial step in his cultivation journey.

The path of the Emperor!

It was like a bridge linking heaven and earth.

Crossing this bridge would make him as vast as the heavens, but falling off it meant he could never ascend again.

Time, on the other hand, was the process.

The insight into the essence of All Things was originally the deduction of myriad phenomena.

Past, present, and future.

The wisdom of clarity unified into one line.

In the past, he was a novice monk, meditating on Wuliang

Mountain for countless years.

Now, he was a transcendent Emperor, standing tall through numerous trials.

However, the current him seemed distant from the past and closer to the future. The Dao felt the same, as if the boundless and fearless Dao of the past was gradually becoming more distant.

The future!

It was vague but filled with hope.

He couldn't see it clearly, but he could sense it.

The future him would control the heavens and the earth, even manipulate time, yet there were large hands holding his spine, and those hands had always been there.

In the future.

Hu Qing's eyes flickered, suddenly opening wide as he directly looked at Jiang Shang.

It seemed like he understood.

The owner of those hands was Jiang Shang!

Hu Qing was stunned.G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

In the future, he would be controlled by his disciple until he became an entity mastering time, still unable to break free.

Jiang Shang saw Hu Qing wake up and softly said, "Master?" "No problem!" Hu Qing continued to close his eyes, returning to the space within.

He hesitated a bit.

He didn't know whether to break through or not.

He could live for others; he had not yet fulfilled the wishes of several masters to convert all the Yan Immortals in the Great Si Region.

"Is continuing down the path the right choice?" Hu Qing murmured to himself.

At this moment, he saw several former masters.

The master with a jade-like face looked at Hu Qing, reaching out as if wanting to pull him.

The rugged abbot, on the other hand, waved goodbye.

He had strayed far from the path of the past.

But he was getting closer and closer to Dao Merge.

The Dao Merge was the true path.

Hu Qing's eyes became determined; he no longer cared about Jiang Shang's hands. Without hesitation, he advanced, impacting the Emperor's realm.

Hum!

Changes were also happening outside.

The light on Hu Qing illuminated the world, far surpassing the radiance within the Lingtai Mountain spring.

On the distant Grave God Mountain, Zhen Ling took back the main body of Shang, standing side by side at the peak. "Success!" Zhen Ling let out a sigh.

On Grave God Mountain, the first Ultimate Dao Lord to break through the Emperor's realm appeared.

Shang's current state could also see Hu Qing, feeling somewhat uneasy. "Lord Zhen Ling, what about those hands?"

"Not hands, but time. That will be Hu Qing's first tribulation!" Zhen Ling was very satisfied.

That trace of the Origin Source of time was something he had placed there.

The remnants of the Western Sea were also a secret confrontation between him and Shen Ling.

It should have been opened long ago.

He understood the matters of Shen Ling better than anyone else, always planning, just waiting for this day.

Allowing Hu Qing to merge with the Dao was more important than the entire ruins in the Western Sea.
