“Smart.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled. “There are a total of sixteen Principles Temples. Apart from the other one which is used for the affinity test, the other fifteen are all for fusing another principle with the spacetime principles. Cultivating in the Principles Temple might not guarantee that you’ll be able to fuse these two principles, but at least it’s much easier than comprehending them yourself.”

“These 15 temples focus on the fusion of principles, including destruction and space-time, life and death and space-time, life and space-time, thunder and space-time, and so on. Heavenly Sword Marquis, I know that apart from the space-time principles, the second principle you have comprehended is the Samsara principles. Among these 15 temples, there is one that combines the Samsara and space-time principles, which you can use.”

“The fusion of space-time and reincarnation?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

The fusion of space-time principles and reincarnation principles were two different principles. When he was in the Blood Wave Temple, he had barely found the key points of the fusion. He had already entered the rudiments of the fusion of the two principles, what he needed next was a lot of time to constantly adapt and study them.

Now, if the Principles Temple that corresponded to space-time and reincarnation was really helpful to the integration of the two principles, it would definitely save him a lot of time.

“Let’s go to the Principles Temple now,” Jian Wushuang said.

Although there were 15 Principles Temples for the integration of principles, he did not need the other Principles Temples for the time being. Only the Principles Temple that corresponded to space-time and reincarnation was useful to him. It would be of great use to him.

“Don’t worry, before you go to the Principles Temple, you have to test your affinity for the principles.” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Rule affinity?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“There are all kinds of principles between heaven and earth, and I don’t need to explain how useful these principles are to cultivators. Every cultivator has a different affinity with the principles between heaven and earth. This affinity represents whether he has the talent and qualification to comprehend this principle.”

“Take you for example. You have been comprehending the space-time principles and the Samsara principles at a very fast speed and have a very high talent. This means that you have a very high affinity with these two principles. Only in this way can you comprehend these two principles so quickly.

“But if it were other principles, such as you comprehending the life-death principles, the same perception, the same opportunity, and the same time, the achievements you can achieve in the life-death principles might not necessarily be able to achieve your achievements in the space-time principles and the Samsara principles,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“I see. The affinity is equivalent to the talent for meditating on various principles. Only when the affinity is high, the speed of meditating on the corresponding principles will be faster.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He could understand what Temple Master Bai Xing meant by affinity, he could understand.

“Yes, the affinity with the principles determines whether you have the qualification and talent to study this principle. You can comprehend the principles of space-time and reincarnation in such a short time, which means that you have a very high affinity with these two principles. If you are an ordinary Immortal Saint, then you don’t need to care about your affinity with the principles of heaven and earth. But you are not ordinary!” Temple Master Bai Xing continued to explain.

“You already have the battle strength of the three realms of void, but you have already grasped the power of will. The strength of the Principles Master depends largely on the power of will. As for the way to obtain the power of will, the most important thing is to grasp more principles or to integrate more principles!”

“You have already grasped one principle, and it won’t be long before you grasp two principles. In the future, you must find a way to grasp the third or even the fourth principle. Naturally, you must now figure out which principles are suitable for you to comprehend so that you can make corresponding preparations in advance.”

Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

Yes, it was enough for him to master the principles of space-time and reincarnation.

However, once he reached the level of Principles Master, he had to find a way to master more principles. At this time, he had to figure out which principles were suitable for him to comprehend.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, come with me.” Temple Master Bai Xing led Jian Wushuang to the building complex of the Principles Temple and directly entered the temple at the front.

There were all kinds of air currents in the magnificent temple. These air currents represented the principles of heaven and earth. At a glance, there were at least hundreds of such air currents, Jian Wushuang could immediately sense the existence of the space-time principles and reincarnation principles from these air currents.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, what should I do?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s simple. You just sit here with your legs crossed, close your eyes and try your best to communicate with the surrounding principles power,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately sat down in the center of the hall according to Temple Master Bai Xing’s instructions, then he closed his eyes and began to communicate with the airflow that represented the principles power.

An hour passed in the blink of an eye.

During this one hour, the air currents in the hall surrounded Jian Wushuang. Among the air currents, a few of them emitted light, some dazzling and some dim.

“Well, you can open your eyes now,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang immediately opened his eyes and saw the airflow that was emitting light.

“These glowing airflow should be the principles power that has a high affinity with me, right?” Jian Wushuang said, because he had noticed the most dazzling airflow among these glowing airflow, it was the airflow that represented the space-time principles.

“Yes, the more dazzling these glows are, the more affinity you have with this principle. Without a doubt, your affinity with the space-time principles is the highest. As for the reincarnation principles, it is slightly inferior to the space-time principles, but its affinity is still very high. In addition, your affinity with the earth principles, the gold principles, and the fate principles is also good. You can find a way to understand these principles in the future!”

“But what surprised me the most was the principles of destruction!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I didn’t expect your talent in the principles of destruction to be so high. It’s not much weaker than yours in the space-time principles,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a hint of surprise.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at one of the equally dazzling airflow that was comparable to the airflow of the space-time principles.

That airflow represented the destruction principles!
