“The Divine Sea?”

Empress Leng glanced at him and nodded. “You’re just a Divine Realm expert, so the Divine Sea is really useful for you. Since that is the case, I’ll allow you to enter it again, and the time limit will be two months.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang was over the moon.

Previously, because of the one-month of cultivation in the Divine Sea, his strength had soared, so the Divine Sea was extremely beneficial to him.

Now he had an opportunity to stay there for two months. Definitely, his overall strength would improve again.

Empress Leng waved her hand and caused three objects to appear. After which these three Emperor Weapons were handed out to the other three guards.

“Alright. Go make your preparations. Remember, in a year from now you must go to the Stellar Fog Sea.” Empress Leng waved her hand and her underlings immediately left.

After walking out of the palace, those guards started talking about it.

“I didn’t expect this Hell Level mission would be to go to the Stellar Fog Sea!”

“The Stellar Fog Sea is the Terminating Sea, the second most dangerous place!”

“Although it’s dangerous, there should be a glimmer of hope for us to survive.”

Jiu Zui, Ling Long, and Shui Jin sighed.

“Blood Mountain.” Commander Hong looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Good boy, you even fooled me.”

The other guards also stared at Jian Wushuang with complicated expressions.

They were still shocked by the news that Jian Wushuang was a Divine Realm expert.

“It’s a pity, with your talent, you would have had a brilliant future, but this time… Alas.” Commander Hong let out a sigh and said, “All four of you should be careful and try your best to get out alive.”

“Yeah.” They nodded.

“Well, you can go start making your preparations.” Commander Hong waved his hand and the other three guards left, except Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, Third Brother!”

Wang Yuan finally couldn’t help it and directly give Jian Wushuang a big bear hug.

“Big Brother Wang Yuan, I haven’t seen you for many years and you seem to be fatter.” Jian Wushuang was laughing and joking. “I heard that you’re the chief alchemist of the Tang of the East. That’s really awesome.”

“How did you know?” Wang Yuan released Jian Wushuang and looked at him.

“I met the second brother on Cercis Island. He told me,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Oh?” Wang Yuan raised his eyebrows and then dragged Jian Wushuang away, “Come, let’s have a drink.”

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and solemnly said, “Big Brother Wang Yuan, I have something to ask you.”

“Say it.” Wang Yuan also became solemn.

“You just said Dragon-phoenix Fruit is needed to prepare an elixir for the princess. You meant Leng Rushuang, right? Has the situation with her Icy Heart Poison become that serious now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, it’s very serious.” Wang Yuan nodded slightly.

“If she doesn’t get the Dragon-phoenix Fruit, what will happen to her?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

Wang Yuan spoke directly, “Without the Dragon-phoenix Fruit, there is no way to refine the Crape Myrtle Elixir. Without that, we can’t detoxify the Icy Heart Poison in her body… she will die!”

“She’ll die?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

“Big Brother Wang Yuan, you’re currently the chief alchemist and qualified to meet Empress Leng, so is it possible for you to take me to meet Leng Rushuang?” He asked.

“You want to meet the princess?” Wang Yuan stunned and thought for a while, “I can take you to the place where she lives, but the rest depends on whether she would like to see you.”

Jian Wushuang responded. “That’s good enough, let’s go.”

Wang Yuan nodded and then led his brother to the princess’s residence.

There was a huge secluded courtyard in the deepest part of the palace.

This courtyard was the residence of the legendary princess of the Tang of the East.

Wang Yuan arrived in the front of the courtyard with Jian Wushuang.

“Please tell the princess, Wang Yuan’s here to pay a visit,” Wang Yuan said to the maid by the gate of the courtyard.

“Master Wang, the princess has already said that she won’t meet anyone. For nearly a hundred years, she has been staying inside. Even Empress Leng has rarely met her, so please go back,” the maid replied.

Wang Yuan frowned.

“Go tell the princess that one of her old friends, Swordsman wants to visit her.” Jian Wushuang stepped forward.

“Swordsman? Friends?” The maid was a little confused. After hesitating for a while, she nodded and said, “Masters, please wait a moment.”

“Third Brother, I wonder whether she will meet you?” Wang Yuan stared at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“I don’t know.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He and Leng Rushuang were friends, but their relationship was quite subtle. Jian Wushuang was not clear about his position in her heart.

The maid came back and shot Jian Wushuang a surprised look before saying, “Masters, the princess asked me to bring you in.”

Wang Yuan grinned. “Third Brother, it seems that you have a place in the heart of the princess. As far as I know, over the past 100 years, many people have asked to visit the princess, but none of them were successful.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Under the guidance of the maid, Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan stepped directly into the courtyard. It was not long before they came to a garden, which was full of all kinds of flowers.

In the center of the garden, there was a jade table with a beautiful lady sitting by it for the moment.

The moment Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan set foot in this garden, they immediately saw her.

Her beauty was indescribable.

Her coldness endowed her with a fairy-like temperament.

The combination of the two characters created a fascinating allure.

It was not the first time that Wang Yuan had met Leng Rushuang. He had seen her once when studying the Icy Heart Poison.

Wang Yuan could not help but sigh. “No wonder so many young talents in the Eternal World are so crazy about her. She is indeed worthy of it.”

At this moment, the gorgeous lady apparently noticed the arrival of the two men. She immediately raised her head and looked over with her beautiful eyes.

Jian Wushuang looked straight into her eyes.

No words or actions were necessary. That simple moment of eye contact was enough to explain everything.
