Chapter 791: The Prosperous Tang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“First Senior Brother, you just said that of the four big counties, the Tang of the East was the most special. What does that mean?” Jian Wushuang asked eagerly.

“I say it is special because the Tang of the East is the most ancient country among the four big countries, and it used to be the most powerful one as well.” Xue Lingtian explained.

“The Tang of the East is slightly younger than the Void Temple. It was founded shortly after the Void Temple was established. No one knows the name of the founder of Tang of the East. People only know that he built the Tang of the East and address him as Tang Emperor in reverence.”

“Tang Emperor?” Jian Wushuang made a mental note of this name.

“The Tang Emperor has an unparalleled strength. Back then, his strength was just slightly inferior to that of our mysterious Temple Master, the founder of the Void Temple. Nearly no one was his match except for our Temple Master.”

“However, soon after the Tang Emperor founded the Tang of the East, he disappeared. No one saw him again after that.” Xue Lingtian said.

“Disappeared?” asked Jian Wushuang. He was intrigued.

“Although the Tang Emperor disappeared, he left four disciples to govern the Tang of the East on his behalf. These four disciples are also extremely powerful, and people call them the Four Emperors of the Eastern Land.” Xue Lingtian went on.

“The four Emperors are Empress Qing, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Empress Leng.”

“Each of the four Emperors has reached the peak of the Dao Master. In particular, Empress Qing is the strongest –?her strength is so mighty that it is almost on par with that of Tang Emperor.”

“Under the governance of the four Emperors, the Tang of the East thrived and prospered. Its success astonished the world and convinced numerous countries to submit themselves to the rule of Tang of the East. Its prosperity was unprecedented. When it was at the height of its power and splendor, even the most ancient Void Temple in the Eternal World had to be scrupulous about the Tang of the East.”

Xue Lingtian sighed in admiration as he recounted the glory of the Kingdom Tang. He continued, “Later on, the other three big countries rose one after another, but they were still in awe of the Tang of the East and never did dare to confront it openly.”

“And that is the period we refer to as the Prosperous Tang!”

“Unfortunately, an unforeseen event occurred which spelled the end of this period of prosperity.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What unforeseen event?” asked Jian Wushuang anxiously.

“I don’t know the details. All I know is that Empress Qing, the strongest out of the four Emperors, was the first to meet his downfall.” Xue Lingtian said slowly. “When Empress Qing died, Emperor Yun, a man who had always loved and admired her, was devastated. Then, Emperor Yun left the Tang of the East by himself, and, just like his Master Tang Emperor, disappeared.”

“So the only two who remained were Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng. The two were a couple at first. Under ordinary circumstances, with their excellent abilities, they could still make the Tang of the East flourish if they worked together. But for some unknown reason, not long after Emperor Yun took off, rumors abound that the couple was in discord. Then, they completely severed their ties and even wielded a war against each other. That was the only internal conflict that the Tang of the East had ever experienced.”

“That fight was incredulously fierce. Ultimately, Emperor Xiao was defeated. She left the Tang of the East with her subordinates and concealed her whereabouts, leaving Empress Leng alone to take charge of the Tang of the East.”

“Despite Empress Leng’s strength and peerless wisdom, the battle strength of the Tang of the East was greatly reduced after the death of Empress Qing and the departure of Emperor Yun. His internal conflicts with Emperor Xiao had also exhausted the treasury and severely weakened the Tang of the East. The other three big countries seized the opportunity to put pressure on the Tang of the East, preventing it from regaining its prosperity.”

“Today, the Tang of the East is the weakest among the four big countries. If not for the possible return of the Tang Emperor, the other three big countries would have long engulfed the Tang of the East.”

“Really?” Hearing Xue Lingtian’s account, Jian Wushuang could not help but heave a sigh.

After a series of mishaps, the Tang of the East had fallen from its position at the top and hit rock bottom.

At this point, Jian Wushuang was filled with burning questions.

For example, why had the Tang Emperor disappeared? How come Empress Qing was dead? And why did the couple, Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng, decide to turn against each other?

Jian Wushuang was more confused than ever about the Tang of the East.

“I’m in debt to Emperor Xiao. The Tang of the East means a lot to me.” Jian Wushuang said. He clenched his hands and looked around. “I’ve made up my mind, I’ll go to the Tang of the East.”

“Oh?” Xue Lingtian and the others smiled but they were not surprised.

Experts in the Tang of the East were as abundant as clouds. It was a great place for adventuring.

“By the way, I also heard that Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng once raised a daughter named Leng Rushuang.”

“It is said that Leng Rushuang is so beautiful that she astounds everyone who sees her. She must be the most beautiful woman in the Eternal World. She’s also exceedingly skillful at playing the eastern zither. Those who were lucky enough to hear her play, including some Dao Masters, were intoxicated with her music. Junior Brother, if you’re fortunate enough to meet this beauty when traveling in the Tang of the East, don’t miss this great chance.” Xue Lingtian said with amusement.

“Leng Rushuang?” Jian Wushuang beamed as the image of that extraordinary beauty instantly appeared in his mind.

Leng Rushuang was definitely the most gorgeous woman Jian Wushuang had ever met. No one else was that beautiful.

In terms of temperament, Jian Wushuang had never seen another woman who was more aloof.

As for Leng Rushuang’s musical talents, her music had truly intoxicated him more than once.

Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly altered and he looked in the direction of Xue Lingtian. “First Senior Brother, you just mentioned that Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng had raised a daughter? Are you sure they only have one daughter?”

“Yeah, I’m sure. Leng Rushuang is the only princess in the Tang of the East. Everybody knows that. What’s the matter?” Xue Lingtian asked, perplexed.

Hearing this reply, Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed.

“If Leng Rushuang is the only daughter, then… what about Leng Ruxue?”?Jian Wushuang’s mind was racing.

When Jian Wushuang was in the Ancient World, Leng Ruxue had been the first person he had met. She was Leng Rushuang’s younger sister. So, she had to be Emperor Xiao’s daughter.

Although Jian Wushuang had not met Leng Ruxue after that, he would never forget the cute girl in filthy clothes.

But if Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng only had one daughter, then, who on earth was Leng Ruxue?

Jian Wushuang shook his head and dismissed his thoughts.

“My present strength is, after all, very weak. After I’ve enhanced my strength, I’ll go to the Tang of the East and search for all the answers.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

For the next few days, Jian Wushuang just sat with his Master and three Senior Brothers, chatting and drinking merrily. Their chats revolved around the topic of the Eternal World.

Their talk went on for three days and nights.

“Swoosh!”

A figure suddenly appeared beside them. He was Palace Master Destruction, one of the 12 Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi, the three magnates have delivered the things you asked for.”
