Chapter 1703: Huge Price

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

What Sir Dog Mad Dog said had shaken Jian Wushuang.

An inverse cultivator required an accumulation of divine power when they were at the level of Real God.

It was an accumulation of extravagantly extensive divine power.

A hundred drops of Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet were harder to precipitate at the later stage. Jian Wushuang had massacred so many Star Demons in the Eighth Lair and collected so many demon cores but he had only managed to precipitate ten drops of Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet with difficulty and broken through to become a stage two Ultimate Real God.

The remaining Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet required absorption of a terrifyingly extensive amount of pure power.

An Emperor God had absorbed three years’ worth of Power of Absolute Beginning in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning until he fully recovered to his peak. Even if an inverse cultivator were to stay in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for five to ten years, his ultimate divine power might not be able to reach a saturation point, which was when he would break through and become stage three Ultimate Real God.

Real God Wu Bei stayed in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for eight years. But in the end, he obviously had yet to reach his limit before he was chased out by Sir God Luo Sha by force.

“With the lesson of Real God Wu Bei, tell me, would the controller of Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. Sir God Luo Sha, let you enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?” Sir God Mad Dog said with a spurious smile.

Jian Wushuang heard and smiled bitterly.

“Is there no way at all?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Whether or not is there a way, we shall see after we meet Sir God Luo Sha,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew that it was useless no matter how much Sir God Mad Dog and him talked. After all, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was in the control of Sir God Mad Dog. The conditions that he had to fulfill and the price he had to pay to enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning would be determined by Sir God Luo Sha.

An ancient green spaceship traveled at fast speed in the void. The speed was terrifyingly fast.

Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog were on the spaceship. They dined and chatted. Occasionally, Jian Wushuang would absorb some demon cores.

Sixty years later, the green spaceship arrived at a remote dark void.

In the dark void, there were layers of prohibition and vast fog. The spacetime was unique too. Unless one knew the background of the void, there wouldn’t be anyone who would barge into the void.

In the middle of the dark void, there was a piece of floating land. The size of the land wasn’t big, it was only about one hundred thousand miles, including mountains and rivers. The scenery was like a painting, was like Land of Peach Blossom.

“This is where Sir God Luo Sha resides?” Jian Wushuang looked at the piece of floating land, “This is so secretive.”

“Humph, Sir God Luo Sha is eccentric and unsociable. Although she is one of the members of Sanctuary Alliance, she almost never visits Thunderbolt Island and she hardly gets in contact with the experts from Sanctuary Alliance. There are even many experts that didn’t know of her existence. She has been living in seclusion. There are less than ten people from the entire Sanctuary Alliance who know her residence place,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“In Sanctuary Alliance, there should be quite a few experts who live in seclusion like Sir God Luo Sha, right?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“There are some and there are quite a few of them,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows but he wasn’t surprised.

At that moment, in the middle of the prohibition surrounding the piece of land in front of them, there was a space tunnel that appeared from nowhere. It was obvious that Sir God Luo Sha had known that they were arriving long ago.

“Come on, let’s head in,” Sir God Mad Dog led the way and entered the space tunnel together with Jian Wushuang.

In the scroll painting-like world on the piece of floating land, there was a simple bamboo house. Before the bamboo house, there was a stone table. Then, there was a silver-haired old lady in a simple robe sitting as she weaved a bamboo basket.

“Old witch, long time no see,” Sir God Mad Dog was casual in his manner. He came before the bamboo house and sat down on the stone stool right opposition the silver-haired old lady as Jian Wushuang stood next to him.

Hearing Sir God Mad Dog’s greetings, Sir God Luo Sha wasn’t angry. “Old Mad Dog, you don’t look for food but came to my place, what for? I don’t have anything for you to eat here.”

“Haha, I know you don’t have anything delicious. I don’t even bother to come and look for you,” Sir God Mad Dog replied casually.

“Oh?” Sir God Luo Sha was surprised. Then, she turned to look at Jian Wushuang, “This is…?”

“Jian Wushuang. Greetings, Sir God Luo Sha,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“Jian Wushuang?” Sir God Luo Sha looked calm, “I have not kept in touch with the outside world for very long and I have never heard of your name. Let me ask around.”

Sir God Luo Sha took out a token and sent a message to ask. In a short while, she received information about Jian Wushuang.

“I see. You’re from Lineage of Star and you’re in the first place on Real God ranking list. You are quite famous,” Sir God Luo Sha looked surprised. Then, she asked, “I wonder what’s the purpose of your visit today?”

“I am coming for the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning,” Jian Wushuang didn’t beat around the bush.

Sir God Luo Sha wasn’t surprised and she continued to weave her bamboo basket while she said calmly, “As Mad Dog has brought you here, he should have told you some stories. Do you think that after what happened with Real God Wu Bei, I would let you, an inverse cultivator, enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?”

“Sir God Luo Sha, in this world, no matter what the incident is, there is space for negotiation. Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning will be really extremely helpful to me but I have no idea what price I have to pay in order to enter and absorb Power of Absolute Beginning to my heart’s content.” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

“The last time Real God Wu Bei entered, he stayed there for eight years. I had to chase him out by force. If I hadn’t, even if he had stayed there for ten years, the divine power in his body might not have reached his limit. An inverse cultivator absorbing ten years’ worth of divine power wantonly, just how extensive would be the amount of Power of Absolute Beginning absorbed? You can’t afford the price!” Sir God Luo Sha said.

“Sir God Luo Sha, if you don’t make it clear, how will I know if I can afford it?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hehe, you’re so stubborn. I’ll be straightforward with you then. I heard that Lineage of Star has got a White Blaze Fruit Tree?” Sir God Luo Sha looked at him.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The White Blaze Fruit Tree was what he had gotten.

“That’s simple. If you have the ability to give the White Blaze Fruit Tree that you gave Lineage of Star to me, I will let you stay in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for ten years,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked strained.

He had known since long ago that Sir God Luo Sha would ask for a huge price but he had never expected it to be that huge.

A White Blaze Fruit Tree?

One should know that the White Blaze Fruit Tree was something that all forces cast greedy eyes over.

Plus, even if he brought a White Blaze Fruit Tree, he could only stay in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for ten years. In ten years, Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure if he could accumulate Ultimate Divine Power to his extreme limit.
