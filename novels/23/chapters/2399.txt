Chapter 2400: The Geniuses Gathered

None of those core disciples attempted to lower their voices so their conversations were loud and clear to everyone that was present.

Including the Second Elder and the Seventh Elder who led the team.

The Second Elder’s eyes were cloudy and her expression did not change at all.

On the contrary, the Seventh Elder was seen sneering.

However, there was one person who thought completely different from the others.

All the core disciples, even the two elders, thought that Jian Wushuang was a burden. On the other hand, the only one among the core disciples who had faith in Jian Wushuang was Xiao Heng.

“These guys...”

Xiao Heng swept his gaze over at the core disciples who were talking and laughing before shaking his head.

He could understand those core disciples because when he went for a mission with Jian Wushuang, he used to look down upon Jian Wushuang like the other core disciples.

It was after that mission, that outer disciple Jian Wushuang had become a monster to Xiao Heng.

At that very moment, two figures came from the void with a swoosh.

They were the duo Elder Wujian and Jian Wushuang.

“It seems we are the last to arrive,” Elder Wujian appeared on the land and muttered to himself.

“Huh, glad that you know.” The Seventh Elder glared at Elder Wujian.

Elder Wujian did not bother to talk to him. Instead, he ordered, “Jian Wushuang, go on.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and emerged in front of the core disciples.

“I, Jian Wushuang, pay my respect to all you Senior Brothers. I’m sorry to have kept you all waiting.” Jian Wushuang was humble and polite.

“Well, glad that you are not oblivious.”

“Indeed, he belongs to the Chaotic Realm.”

The core disciples all stared at Jian Wushuang with a weird smile. None of them were willing to respond positively to him.

Xiao Heng was the only one who stepped forward and said humbly, “Junior Brother Wushuang, this time you and I are together again. I hope that Junior Brother can take care of me when we are in the Saint’s Tomb later.”

“Oh? Senior Brother Xiao Heng?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows but did not say much.

Xiao Heng did not mind either.

The core disciples next to Xiao Heng all looked over at their direction in surprise.

“Xiao Heng, when did you become so talkative?”

“It’s just an outer disciple. Does he even deserve your humility?”

“Xiao Heng, this is so not you.”

The core disciples were teasing Xiao Heng.

The core disciples who were nominated to the tomb were all among the best core disciples of Narcissus Island. Each of them was excellent no matter in terms of talent or ranking. They were not inferior to Xiao Heng and some were even better than Xiao Heng, hence they were communicating on an equal footing and did not refer to each other by seniority. They called each other by name instead.

Upon hearing those ridicules, Xiao Heng was a little annoyed and said, “What do you know? Though Junior Brother Wushuang is only an outer disciple, he is different from the average outer disciples and has strong abilities.”

“Did you just say a Chaotic Realm is very powerful? Xiao Heng, are you sure you aren’t dreaming?”

The core disciples continued teasing Xiao Heng without taking his words to heart.

“Anyway, I’ve already said what I have to say. It’s your business whether you believe it or not and you will soon realize the truth after entering the Saint’s Tomb.” Xiao Heng curled his lips and did not bother talking to them anymore.

“Well, it’s time. Let’s set off.” The Second Elder who was resting with her eyes closed suddenly announced.

“Yes.”

Even the Seventh Elder and Elder Wujian could not refute her orders.

“Fix up the formation,” ordered the Seventh Elder.

At the sound of his voice, countless secret patterns appeared in the center of the land.

A gush of majestic divine power emanated and a huge spatial passage appeared at the land’s center in just a few moments.

It was difficult to create a huge spatial passage as heaven and earth were stable.

Some powerful sects in the Wusha Wasteland had the ability to create spatial passages and Narcissus Island was one of them.

Under the personal guidance of the three elders, ten disciples, including Jian Wushuang, stepped into the spatial passage.

With a flash of the dazzling light, when Jian Wushuang and the others reappeared again they had already arrived in a large glade.

When they arrived at the glade, there were already large numbers of figures there.

They were the disciples from various sects of Wusha Wilderness and their elders who led the teams.

They all instantly noticed Jian Wushuang and his group.

“Are they disciples from Narcissus Island?”

“Yes, they are from Narcissus Island. There are three elders and ten disciples. The two disciples in the center must be the famous duo, Zhong Yi and Su Tong.”

“Zhong Yi and Su Tong seem to be very capable. Especially Zhong Yi, which I heard was comparable to those from the lower rank of the Twelve Minor Kings.”

“Well, why is there a Chaotic Realm among the disciples of Narcissus Island? Is he also preparing to enter the Saint’s Tomb?”

“Haha, a Chaotic Realm entering the Saint’s Tomb. How interesting!”

There were whispering sounds everywhere on the glade and many people cast their eyes in the direction of the people from Narcissus Island.

Most of the gazes were on Zhong Yi and Su Tong, but some of them were on Jian Wushuang making the other seven core disciples less noticeable.

However, they quickly shifted their gaze away.

After all, there were many more geniuses on the glade beside Zhong Yi and Su Tong.

“There are so many people around.”

Xiao Heng and the other core disciples were also checking around. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“There must be hundreds of people around here? Almost all of them are Second-Class Divine Demons. There are only a few Third-Class Divine Demons,” Xiao Heng commented.

Those that were preparing to enter Saint’s Tomb were mostly Second-Class Divine Demons genius disciples. There were fewer First-Class Divine Demons as compared to the Second-Class Divine Demons. However, the total number of First-Class Divine Demons was around 40 to 50 and most of them were first-timers.

As for the Third-Class Divine Demons, they were the least because they usually would not attempt to enter the Saint’s Tomb.

Jian Wushuang, who was a Chaotic Realm was absolutely uncommon.

He attracted so much attention due to his circumstances.

“Jian Wushuang, look in that direction.”

“That red-haired man is the top genius of the Blood Mountain Sect, Huo Yang. He is also one of the Twelve Minor Kings. He is ranked tenth among the Twelve Minor Kings. Although his ranking is relatively low, he is very powerful. He once fought head-on with a Peak Stage Divine Demon and lost the battle which lasted for a long time.”

Elder Wujian stood beside Jian Wushuang as he was introducing Jian Wushuang to the geniuses on the glade.

Jian Wushuang looked at Huo Yang.

“So, he is ranked tenth? Bai Tao seems to be ranked eleventh. Since their rankings are close, I supposed their powers are of a similar level,” murmured Jian Wushuang.
