Chapter 1772: Heaven and Earth Supremes!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Of course, the grey-robed elderly was just guessing.

After all, no one knew how strong Emperor Bai was when he was at Real God realm. He was too ancient.

“Since ancient times and the first era’s passing, there has been hardly anyone like this impressive young man. If he were to continue to grow, it would be totally possible for him to become the second Emperor Bai,” the grey-robed elderly muttered. Then, he turned to look at the middle-aged man, “East Royal, did you come to see me because of this?”

“Yes,” the middle-aged man nodded, “According to the segregation of power, Jian Wushuang fits the criteria to be listed on Heaven and Earth Supremes!”

“Heaven and Earth Supremes?” The grey-robed elderly squinted his eyes and then nodded, “If so, let’s announce it to the public.”

The two super expert of Great Emperor level made a decision and immediately spread the mysterious ranking list at a terrifyingly fast speed.

The announcement of the ranking list did not stir any great commotion on Thunderbolt Island because most of the experts in Sanctuary Alliance weren’t qualified to get in contact with the ranking list.

However, the overlords at the peak of the Eternal Chaotic World and the Almigthies were surprised when they received the ranking list.

“Heaven and Earth Supremes, Jian Wushuang is listed on Heaven and Earth Supremes!”

“Heaven and Earth Supremes, any one of them is a super existence that shakes the universe. Only the few top Sir Gods meet the criteria to be listed on Heaven and Earth Supremes. Jian Wushuang is just a Real God and he has already reached such a level?”

“I remember when I first heard Jian Wushuang’s name, it was a few tens of thousands of years ago when Real God Wu Bei’s cave dwelling was opened. Jian Wushuang wiped out all geniuses in the realm of Universe Gods and got himself two White Blaze Fruit Trees. He then gained fame. The second time I heard of him, he fought with Sir God Qian Lan from Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Eighth Lair and he injured Sir God Qian Lan badly. This time, it is my third time hearing his name and he is already listed on Heaven and Earth Supremes!”

“Too fast. This Jian Wushuang has improved too quickly. It is so unbelievable. If he continues to grow at the current speed, he might become the second Emperor Bai!”

Countless super existences was shocked because of the ranking list.

At the same time, there were many Almighties that were roaring and bellowing in anger because of the ranking list.

One should know that the ranking list was a far-fetched desire of many Almighties. Many Almighties and ancient existences couldn’t be listed but Jian Wushuang, a young man that had only cultivated for tens of thousands of years, had been listed on the list.

Once listed on Heaven and Earth Supremes, one would be an authority in Eternal Chaotic World.

…

Sea Continent, on a nameless mountain, Jian Wushuang was sitting alone. He was recovering his wounds and divine power.

During the battle with Soaring Heaven Mansion, although he killed three Sir Gods, many Real Gods and Universe Gods from Soaring Heaven King Place, he was injured by the attack of God Slayer Arrow shot by Emperor God Tian Xiao. But such an injury could be recovered very soon with King of Venomous Worms.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a murky breath and he slowly opened his eyes.

“At first, I thought as long as I didn’t barge into Soaring Heaven King Palace’s old lair in Soaring Heaven Land, I wouldn’t be threatened and it would be easy to exterminate Soaring Heaven Mansion. However, I obviously belittled Soaring Heaven King Palace’s power,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Soaring Heaven Mansion was only Soaring Heaven King Palace’s second lair and it was located on Sea Continent.

One should know that the foundation of Soaring Heaven King Palace was in Soaring Heaven Land. Hence, their power in Soaring Heaven Land should be the strongest. Especially the old lair in Soaring Heaven Land was a danger spot that even top Emperor Gods didn’t dare to wallop. Jian Wushuang had never thought of barging into the old lair of Soaring Heaven King Palace as well.

However, Jian Wushuang had never expected that even though he didn’t barge into the old lair of Soaring Heaven King Palace, Emperor God Tian Xiao alone could also injure him.

The God Slayer Arrow had formed a fair threat against him.

Based on the foundation of Soaring Heaven King Palace, they might be able to play a scarier and more ferocious trump card than the God Slayer Arrow.

Of course, even if that was true, Jian Wushuang wasn’t afraid.

After all, he had never once given play to any of his trump cards.

Star Destruction Skill, Mountain River Map, Secret Skill of Star Palace, these were all Jian Wushuang’s trump cards. A single move could destroy the universe. With these trump cards on hand, Jian Wushuang had the capital to be fearless against Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang, well done,” Hall Master Yuan sent him a message.

“You heard the news?” Jian Wushuang immediately replied.

“Of course. You made a scene in Sea Continent. The entire Sanctuary Alliance, the entire Eternal Chaotic World are in a tumultuous hubbub. How could I not know?” Hall Master Yuan chuckled and he complimented, “To be frank, I thought you could kill one or two Sir Gods in Soaring Heaven King Palace and that would be?impressive enough. I never expected you to barge into Soaring Heaven Mansion and killed four Sir God from Soaring Heaven King Palace at one goal, including Sir God Chi Xing. You and Emperor God Tian Xiao were well-matched too. Tsk tsk…”

“Hall Master Yuan, you didn’t message me to tell me this, right?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Of course not,” Hall Master Yuan became serious. “Jian Wushuang, I’m going to send you a ranking list. You should take a look carefully.”

“Ranking list? What ranking list?” Jian Wushuang was confused,

“Heaven and Earth Supremes ranking list!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Hall Master Yuan didn’t say much but sent a boundless ranking list over.

Jian Wushuang received them with care. After he received all, he read through the ranking list. Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in surprise, “This is… Almighty ranking list?

“Yes, and no,” Hall Master Yuan answered.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Jian Wushuang, you have yet to hear about Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, right?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“It is my first time hearing this,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“That’s right,’ Hall Master Yuan laughed as he explained, “Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, you have to first understand the meaning of Heaven and Earth Supreme. Heaven and Earth Supreme is referring to super expert who can establish a great force and shake the entire Eternal Chaotic World. Such experts are normally Emperor Gods!”

“Of course, Eternal Chaotic World is so huge. There’s ten sanctuaries, countless Holy Kingdoms, various territories, there are many Almighties. There are some very amazing Sir Gods too. Even when they fight with Emperor Gods, they could be evenly matched or they could survive Emperor Gods’ attack. Sir Gods like that are qualified to be Heaven and Earth Supremes as well.

“The Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list is announced by Sanctuary Alliance personally. They organized and made a list of Heaven and Earth Supremes that could frighten Eternal Chaotic World, then they ranked them according to their power. It then formed the ranking list of the highest level!”

“To be listed on the ranking list means that the person has already reached the top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World!”
