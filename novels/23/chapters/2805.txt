Chapter 2806: Distribution

(Second update!)

——

“The second condition,” Jian Wushuang continued, “70% of the territory and properties under the control of the Tower of life and death.”

The Tower Master trembled.

Behind him, the great divine masters from the Tower of life and death looked furious.

Even though they were prepared, they still found it hard to accept Jian Wushuang’s second condition.

Hand over 70% of their territories and industries?

After all, the Tower of life and death had spent a long time to manage these territories and industries. This was their true foundation.

Losing 50,000 sacred elixirs and resources was nothing. As long as they were given time, they could slowly accumulate the industries under the Tower of life and death. But now that they lost their industries, they lost the capital to accumulate resources.

This condition was much harsher than the previous one.

“I, the Tower of life and death, accept this condition!”

As the Tower Master said this, his teeth were chattering. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He had no other choice. Otherwise, he would never agree to such a condition.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled and said again, “One last condition. Crimson Rock Castle has just been engaged in a war and does not have enough experts. Therefore, the Tower of life and death needs to send a few experts to follow our orders. I see that the Tower of life and death still has more than ten great divine masters. How about this? Sending eight great divine masters is not a lot.”

Jian Wushuang said casually, but in the ears of the great divine masters of the Tower of life and death, their expressions changed drastically.

Some of them were even more furious after their deaths.

“You want the sacred elixirs, you want the property, and now you want the experts of the Tower of life and death?”

The experts of the Tower of life and death were all extremely shocked and furious. If they did not know the terrifying strength of Jian Wushuang, they would have rushed forward and cut him into pieces.

They had no choice. Jian Wushuang’s three conditions were indeed a little too excessive.

They were so excessive that they could not accept it.

The life and death Tower Master’s body was trembling at the moment, and his heart was burning with anger, but he could only endure it.

After a long while, he finally raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang again. “Mr. Jian Yi, the life and death Tower has agreed to the third condition, but I wonder which eight experts of the life and death Tower do you need to follow the orders of the Crimson Rock Castle?”

“Tower Master!” The great divine masters were all shocked.

The Tower Master waved his hand, indicating that they should not say anything.

“Let me look at the eight experts.” Jian Wushuang smiled and pointed with his finger. “This, this, and that...”

The great divine masters of the Tower of life and death were selected by Jian Wushuang one by one.

The great divine masters he selected were all great divine masters with strong divine power and strength, leaving behind the weak.

After selecting eight great divine masters, there were four great divine masters left in the Tower of life and death. Apart from the Tower Master, there were only three junior great divine masters. One of them had just become a great divine master.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang wanted the Tower Master to become a commander without a leader.

Even if he had the battle strength of a peak great divine master, he had no other great divine masters to command. He would not be able to do anything in the future even if he wanted to.

“After these people go to Crimson Rock Castle, the upper echelons of the Tower of life and death will be a little empty. However, don’t worry, Tower Master. If there are other forces in the Danyang continent who dare to harbor ill intentions toward the Tower of life and death, the Crimson Rock Tower will not pretend not to see it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Now that the matter is settled, I can give you a month’s time. I hope you can prepare everything in a month. I still have something to do, so I’ll take my leave first.”

With that, Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

After Jian Wushuang left, the experts of the Tower of life and death immediately burst into an uproar.

“Tower Master, Jian Yi’s conditions are so excessive. Why did you agree to them?” A great divine master roared.

The Tower Master shook his head with a bitter smile, “So what if I don’t agree? I’m not as strong as him. If I dared to say no just now, Jian Yi would immediately start a massacre. Who in the Tower of life and death can stop him?

“Now, although the Tower of life and death has paid a great price and lost 70% of its foundation, the Tower of life and death is still safe.”

“It’s enough that the Tower of life and death is safe.”

Hearing the words of the Tower Master, the surrounding great divine masters all fell silent.

...

The tower of life and death was carried out smoothly because of Jian Wushuang’s intimidation.

Although the other three forces were not as straightforward, they still submitted one by one and paid a huge price.

The price was similar to that of the life and death Tower.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er met again.

“Things are going very smoothly. The four forces are all willing to submit, and they have offered huge resources and 70% of their assets. They have also agreed to send a group of experts to follow the orders of our Crimson Rock Castle,” Yin Su’er said, then she looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Mr. Jian Yi, the Sword Union is largely responsible for the victory of the war, including the results we have obtained. How do you want to distribute the things we have obtained from the four top forces?”

They had obtained great benefits, so they had to distribute them.

After all, the Sword Union and the Crimson Rock Castle were just cooperating with each other, not a real family.

“I need sacred elixirs,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“I know.” Yin Su’er nodded slightly, “How about this, Mr. Jian Yi, I will give you all the sacred elixirs I have obtained from the four top forces, including the Nangong Palace, the life and death Tower, the Divine Devil sect, and the Dongfang family. As for the territories and properties of the four top forces, how about they belong to the Crimson Rock Castle?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked indifferent. Behind him, Elder Tong, Great Divine Master Jue Xin, and the others all frowned.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded and agreed.

“Agreed?” Yin Su’er was shocked. Yun Shan, Palace Master Si Zhen, and the others behind her were also surprised.

The territories and properties controlled by the four top forces were obviously more valuable and much more valuable.

This distribution was obviously unfair. Yin Su’er had only said it casually and did not expect Jian Wushuang to agree.

However, Jian Wushuang not only agreed, but also did not hesitate at all.

“Mr. Jian Yi, it’s a deal,” Yin Su’er said.

“Okay.” Jian wushuang nodded.
