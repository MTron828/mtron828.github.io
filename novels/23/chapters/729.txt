Chapter 730: The Second Level of the Sword Heart

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the deserted mountaintop, a fresh breeze swept across Jian Wushuang’s face. He sat down in the breeze with his legs crossed and gently closed his eyes.

After traveling, fighting, battling for so many years, he was proud his improvement thus far, felt the thrill of facing a powerful opponent, and also experienced the anxiety and desperation of being driven to the edge.

But now, he had calmed down.

All those feelings had been replaced by a sense of calm.

Now, Jian Wushuang’s mind was unprecedentedly poised.

“It’s been eighty years!”

“The past eighty years have certainly been colorful!”

Sitting on the mountaintop cross-legged, Jian Wushuang was smiling. His smile was sincere and brought about by the real joy held in his heart.

Eighty years had passed since he started to visit the ten tribes one by one and then entered the Boundless Wilds to tackle various wild beasts.

The insights that he gained bit by bit during eighty years of frenetical challenges and battles suddenly matured at this moment.

He managed to rise abruptly, carried by his accumulated strength!

This was just like what some of the Human Warriors did. They spent many years to study the Way, trying to expand their understanding of it. And one day, the comprehension just dawned on them, with all the wonders combined into one and infused with their hearts.

This was exactly what happened to Jian Wushuang…

He had learned and experienced many things over the course of the past eighty years.

It had not yet been forty years since he left the Ancient World and journeyed to the Eternal World, but this wasn’t even half as long as the time he spent in this Eternal Zone.

In the past eighty years, maybe his strength did not increase dramatically and he was still in the Skyscraping Realm, but his experience grew significantly. Now, he had accumulated a huge amount of battle experience and innumerable battle techniques.

These were huge gains for him.

And what mattered most for him was the baptism of his heart.

Right now, Jian Wushuang was sitting cross-legged on a mountaintop with a bland smile. Despite his benign face, his body was emitting a stream of fierce Sword Essence. He appeared to have turned into an unmatched sharp sword that could pierce the sky.

This sword had been polished for a long time and was ready to shine.

Meanwhile, something was changing inside Jian Wushuang’s body.

He was metamorphosing!

Yes, his heart was metamorphosing!

As his heart was changing, the radiance released by the sharp sword that he had transformed into started to dim. Slowly, the sword returned to its normal state.

In the end, it completely vanished.

On the peak of the mountain, Jian Wushuang’s hair was fluttering in the wind. If someone in a place nearby were to look at him at this moment, he would regard Jian Wushuang as an ordinary guy, because no trace of Sword Intent was apparent. In fact, his Sword Intent had already dwelled deep down his heart.

“Learning the Sword Principle starts from the shallow, then to the profound and returns to the shallow once again.”

“Sword Heart, Level Two!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. It seems that the brilliance of a powerful sword had burst out, but the surrounding void did not stir.

This was the phase Jian Wushuang accomplished at this moment, which was actually the Level Two of Sword Heart.

Learning the Sword Heart was the threshold of studying the Sword Principle.

Just like the separation of Warriors, the study of Sword Heart was also divided into six levels.

Back then, when Jian Wushuang had an epiphany halfway through his journey to the Ninth Heaven Road and conjured the Sword Heart, he merely stepped into the course of Sword Heart study, which was not even counted as Level One.

After that, Jian Wushuang began to practice strenuously on the Sword Mountain for six years and since then had made great progress in the sword cultivation. Now, he had now reached Level One of the Sword Heart study and thoroughly consolidated his power.

During the eighty years he spent in the Eternal Zone, he first challenged One-star Ancient Gods of the ten tribes, and then came to the Boundless Wilds for adventure and experienced many fierce battles against highly powerful wild beasts for decades.

Those battles and experiences elevated his heart and soul.

He also made a huge breakthrough in the Sword Principle and successfully progressed to Level Two of the Sword Heart study.

In the Eternal Realm, only a handful of people could reach this level.

Similarly, when his Sword Heart skill made a breakthrough and was fully turned on, its power would soar and his ability in swordsmanship would rise to a new level.

“According to my Master, it normally takes a genius of the Sword Principle more than a thousand years to upgrade to Level Two from Level One. But I achieved this within eighty years.” Jian Wushuang beamed.

Each level of the Sword Heart study represented a metamorphosis. Accordingly, it was extremely difficult to progress from one level to another.

For those Sword Principle experts in the Eternal Realm, it was common for them to be stuck at the same level for thousands of years before making a new breakthrough.

Therefore, the accomplishment Jian Wushuang achieved in merely eighty years was a miracle.

“After eighty years of adventures, I’ve gained a lot. It’s time to go back.” Jian Wushuang got to his feet and looked into the distance.

What he was gazing at was the surroundings of the ten tribes of the Ancient God Clans.

On that day, Jian Wushuang set off on his journey back to the Ancient God Clan. A month later, he already traveled beyond the endless wasteland.

Then, after another two weeks, he finally returned to the Eighth Tribe where he had lived for ten years.

In the colossal mountains of the Eighth Tribe.

Jian Wushuang was strolling among the tribe. Soon, some of the clansmen began to recognize him.

“That’s…Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang? Really?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Seventy years ago, Jian Wushuang left our tribe to travel around the world. Men of other tribes sometimes still talk about him. They said he continued to challenge those One-star clansmen in other tribes. But after a while, he disappeared. Rumors had it that he went to the Boundless Wilds for adventure.”

“It seems as though he has finished traveling and returned.”

“Endless wasteland! I heard that place is extremely dangerous. Only Militant Warriors dare to enter the Boundless Wilds.”

When those clansmen saw Jian Wushuang, some discussed him in whispers; some went forward to greet him.

Jian Wushuang had caused a huge sensation in the Eighth Tribe seventy years ago when he challenged those One-star clansmen like mad.

Many of them had crossed swords with Jian Wushuang, so Jian Wushuang was no stranger to them.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang.”

A loud and clear laughter sounded, and then, a strong looking young man headed towards Jian Wushuang.

“Gu Lan!” At the sight of this man, Jian Wushuang beamed.

“You have returned from your adventures?”

Gu Lan walked to Jian Wushuang and gave him a soft punch. Then, he said in haste, “Great timing! Come, come with me. Let’s go to the Underground Palace.”

“To the Underground Palace? But why?” Jian Wushuang asked, bewildered.

“A new Militant Warrior just arrived in our tribe. His name is Jiu You. Right now, he is going through the Heaven Level Test in the Underground Palace. I heard that he has already breezed through the fifth stage.” Gu Lan replied.
