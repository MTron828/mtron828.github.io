Chapter 420: Jiushe Cave Mansion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Don’t worry. They wouldn’t have assigned an impossible task. The power of the Formation is?extraordinary, but I have my methods to break it,” Bone King laughed.

“Oh?” the experts were surprised.

“The most indestructible part of the cave mansion is the Formation. If it can be broken, those guards aren’t a great threat,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Everyone, don’t worry about the Formation. I guess you’ll have no problems dealing with the cave mansion guards. The most difficult part of this task is to guard it after we occupy it!” Bone King said seriously, and then clapped his hands.

A woman in a purple robe walked in immediately.

“Nice to meet you, I’m Lady Red.” As an ordinary expert at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm, the lady was humble and respectful to Jian Wushuang and the other experts.

“Lady Red was sent by high officials and has great attainment in Formation. After we occupy the cave mansion, she’ll set the Formation. That will definitely take some time.?While that’s in progress, we can expect Pale Moon Marquis to send experts to attack us!”

“We have to fight the experts of Pale Moon Marquis camp to buy time for her. Don’t let anyone interfere with her. Once the Formation is finished, the cave mansion will be controlled by Drifting-blood Marquis camp. We will then be able to use the Formation to stop those experts,” Bone King explained as he looked around.

The experts understood what Bone King said.

The cave mansions were the most coveted objects on the Flaming Battlefield.

All cave mansions were valuable to the two camps. Pale Moon Marquis camp would dispatch experts immediately if they lost a mansion. What they had to do was to hold off the experts until Lady Red finished setting the Formation.

“I’m afraid it won’t be easy for us to stop those experts of Pale Moon Marquis,” Beast said in a low voice.

“Indeed. That’s why the reward is huge. The cave mansion is also an opportunity. It’s up to you to seize it. I’ve specially invited Swordsman for this task. His Realm will be of great help to us,” Bone King laughed.

“Swordsman?” Beast glanced at Jian Wushuang. His eyes carried a trace of disdain and a hint of?violence.

All the experts present were at the Top of Stage Three and were famous in the Inner Area.

Jian Wushuang was merely a newcomer with ordinary battle strength, at about the high level of Stage Three. That was why Beast had not paid him any attention.

He was not aware that the Jian Wushuang had condensed the Origin Mark.

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had increased by several times and he had reached the Peak of Stage Three. With the assistance of his Realm, Jian Wushuang was confident that if he had to fight Beast, it would end in a draw.

“Beast, don’t underestimate Swordsman’s Realm. Xue Yang and I witnessed it just now. Even I was greatly oppressed by his Realm and my strength dropped sharply. His Realm will be of immense help for this task,” Bone King said.

“I hope so,” Beast curled his lips.

“Bone King,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said, “Our task is to occupy a cave mansion, but which one?”

The other experts turned to look at Bone King.

Pale Moon Marquis controlled numerous cave mansions, including extremely valuable ones and ordinary ones which were nearly empty. They would naturally pay more attention to the valuable ones.

“Our target is Jiushe Cave Mansion!” said Bone King.

“Jiushe?” Jian Wushuang and the other experts were surprised.

Pale Moon Marquis camp controlled many cave mansions, including three marquis cave mansions.

The three marquis cave mansions were the most valuable and their defenses were unassailable.

Occupying those mansions would only be possible for experts of lord level rather than Stage Three experts of the Saint Realm like them.

Jiushe Cave Mansion was not a marquis cave mansion. However, it was very precious and just slightly less important than the three marquis cave mansions!

Jiushe Lord was a famous Cloud Realm expert who had died a thousand years ago. In terms of strength, he was second only to a marquis.

The cave mansion he had left behind was extremely valuable. It had been discovered less than 10 years ago.

That meant that it would still contain hidden treasures or opportunities, which would be of great help to any Warrior.

Its importance to Pale Moon Marquis was only second to the three marquis cave mansions.

“Jiushe Cave Mansion, we’re going to occupy the Jiushe Cave Mansion!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“The Pale Moon Marquis camp will be enraged if we occupy the Jiushe Cave Mansion!”

“Jiushe Cave Mansion is not an ordinary lord’s cave mansion.”

The experts were excited and broke into a discussion among themselves.

Jian Wushuang sat at the table, his eyes slightly closed.

Jiushe Lord had been an expert of Sword Principle. Therefore, there must be several opportunities for Warriors of Sword Principle in his cave mansion.

Jiushe Cave Mansion was quite attractive to him.

“Everyone,” Bone King spoke again in a loud voice.

“That’s all I have to say about the task. It’s very difficult and dangerous; however, it’s also rewarding. You’ll have to weigh its risks against its benefits. Take it or leave it, it’s up to you.”

The experts quieted down and considered their options.

The rewards were tempting, but the task was also extremely dangerous.

“Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I’m in,” Xue Yang said.

“Since Xue Yang is going, I must go too. Life in the Inner Area is boring now. I need to find some excitement,” Beast grinned.

The remaining two experts hesitated, but nodded their assent after a moment.

“If you don’t mind, I’ll go with you and help you as much as possible,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, Swordsman, your Realm Technique is a powerful weapon for us,” Bone King laughed.

“When should we start?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Now!” A glimmer of anticipation shone in Bone King’s eyes.
