Chapter 819: The Number One Divine Realm Expert Isn’t That Formidable

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

BANG!

There was a sound of a heavy impact as he hit the ground, which caused the Blood Battle Arena to shake violently. Seconds later, everything subsided.

Only silence followed!

A deathly silence hung over the whole Blood Battle Arena.

The entire audience, including the ordinary warriors, the subordinates of the Lord of Cercis Island, and the experts from the Xia Clan, watched the scene in disbelief.

“He, he lost?”

Someone finally broke the silence, and then the whole Blood Battle Arena burst into shouting and heated discussions.

“He lost. The number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World has been defeated!”

“And it was a miserable defeat!”

“Within three strikes…”

Many Warriors muttered in horror.

The fight took place under their very eyes, so they saw everything clearly.

It was the truth, Xia Yan was miserably defeated within only three strikes.

With only three strikes…

The first strike made Xia Yan spit blood and seriously injured him.

The second strike knocked the saber out of his hand.

The third strike hit Xia Yan hard and knocked him into the ground. It was a quick attack! And, if Jian Wushuang had not shown mercy, Xia Yan would have died.

All in all, Xia Yan was completely overpowered by Jian Wushuang.

There was no room for Xia Yan to fight back.

The gap between their strength was enormous.

Before their fight, Xia Yan was known as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, while Jian Wushuang was just an ordinary Divine Realm expert.

While the audience still remained in shock, Jian Wushuang walked off the arena to the ground below.

Xia Yan was pale and covered in blood. He struggled to get up, but failed. At this moment, two experts of the Xia Clan hurriedly came to him and helped him up.

After getting up, Xia Yan had barely managed to look up when he saw Jian Wushuang coming slowly toward him with an emotionless expression on his face.

“The number one Divine Realm expert isn’t that formidable!” Jian Wushuang said nonchalantly.

“The number one Divine Realm expert isn’t that formidable?”?everyone in the surrounding area repeated those words in their mind.

It frightened them.

However, they secretly admired Jian Wushuang and approved of his words.

Although Xia Yan was known as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, he was much weaker than Jian Wushuang. So to speak, when compared with Jian Wushuang, he really was not that formidable.

But those words shattered Xia Yan’s source of pride.

His face twisted and the eyes he used to look at Jian Wushuang were full of the greatest venom.

“Swordsman!”

Xia Yan growled while clenching his hands, with a hint of madness in his voice.

“Is there anything wrong with what I said?” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

“If you can be called the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, there will be too many number one Divine Realm experts of the Eternal World.”

He added in a flat voice.

“Oh, I heard that your elder brother is recognized as the number one Eternal Realm expert of the Eternal World, and the youngest expert in the Eternal Realm in history. Is that right?”

“The number one Eternal Realm expert in the Eternal World, I had been looking forward to meeting him before, but after meeting you, humph, his title is probably an empty reputation as well.”

“You bastard!” Xia Yan was so angry that he couldn’t help spitting out a mouthful of blood again. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At this moment…

“Humph!”

A cold snort suddenly sounded at the edge of the arena. The glum elder of the Xia Clan looked up at Jian Wushuang and said, “Junior, are you trying to provoke our Xia Clan?”

“Provoke you?” Jian Wushuang shook his head calmly, and said, “No, how would I dare to provoke the most powerful overlord clan in the Tang of the East! I’m just stating the truth.”

“Humph, you are just stating the truth?” the glum elder shot back. His eyes had become freezing cold and even flashed with a slight killing intent.

“Haha, Mr. He, it’s just a fight between the younger generation. Don’t take it too seriously,” the Lord of Cercis Island mediated.

“The second master is powerful and we have already seen it with our own eyes. But, the Eternal World is vast. As the saying goes, there is always a higher mountain. It’s normal that there are one or two Divine Realm experts stronger than him.”

The glum elder squinted, but since the Lord of Cercis Island intervened, he could say no more.

“All right, what has happened today is nothing more than my daughter’s nonsense. Please don’t take it too seriously, everybody. Let’s go back to the feast,” the Lord of Cercis Island said as he led the experts away.

Although the people of the Xia Clan were unwilling to leave like this, they would not offend the Lord of Cercis Island while they were on Cercis Island, so they also left.

Xia Yan left with the help of two experts from the Xia Clan. However, before he left, he continuously glared at Jian Wushuang with obvious resentment.

On the contrary, Lin Wan was smiling. She took a glance at Jian Wushuang and thanked him in a low voice as she left.

Many experts had left, so Jian Wushuang had no intention of remaining. Under the countless gazes filled with awe, he walked out of the Blood Battle Arena along with Yang Zaixuan.

As soon as they were out of the Blood Battle Arena, Yang Zaixuan said, “Well done, Third brother. You defeated Xia Yan in only three strikes. It will not be long before the experts from all the powers in the Eternal World start calling you the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World.”

“It’s just an empty honor. It is of no use and will even cause a lot of trouble instead,” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a wry smile. He didn’t care about the title at all.

“By the way, why did you help Miss Wan’er deal with Xia Yan? That’s not your usual style. Do you have something against Xia Yan? Why did you humiliate him after you beat him?” Yang Zaixuan inquired.

He could see that Jian Wushuang had humiliated Xia Yan deliberately.

“I humiliated him?” Jian Wushuang sniffed, “I was just testing him. But I didn’t expect him to be so bitter, and it was all written on his face. He can’t even control his emotions. He’s obviously an idiot.”

“I don’t think Xia Yan will let this matter rest.”

“Since Xia Yan is an idiot, I wonder what his elder brother will be like,” Jian Wushuang said.

There was a strange flash of emotions in his eyes.

What he cared about was not Xia Yan, but his elder brother and the Xia Clan.

What he had just done in the Blood Battle Arena was, in fact, only a preliminary test.

Before he promised to help Lin Wan, he knew that helping her would definitely offend Xia Yan and the Xia Clan, so he was already prepared for the consequences.

Besides, he would definitely prevent Leng Rushuang from marrying into the Xia Clan.

Anyway, he would become an enemy of the Xia Clan sooner or later. Setting things in motion now just meant that he was a little ahead of schedule, so it didn’t matter to him.
