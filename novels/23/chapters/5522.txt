Chapter 5521: Devouring the Divine Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is this all you’ve got?” Jian Wushuang maintained a calm facade, mocking, “Even being a gatekeeper seems too much for you!’

The one guarding the main gate of the Elder Palace was none other than the Grand Ancestor of the Shangqing Grand Ancestor, a tier 6 peak-level

Emperor. Despite an incomplete Origin Source, he cultivated a Sword Dao centered around the mastery of killing, compensating for the deficiency. His fierce sword technique was more than enough to confront peak-level tier 6

Emperors of the Elder Palace.

It seemed challenging for Tian Cang to surpass Shangqing.

Provoked by Jian Wushuang, Tian Cangs expression turned somewhat ferocious, evidently not expecting such resistance.

Clearly, a mere tier 6 ordinary Emperor could contend with him to this extent.

“Come on, don’t hide!” Tian Cang angrily shouted, taking the initiative this time.

However, his speed was too slow.

Jian Wushuang, hands behind his back, taunted, “Are you a water monkey? Why so slow?”

With a slight turn, avoiding a fierce punch, Jian Wushuang raised his hand, unleashing a series of lethal sword strikes.

While the opponent dared not kill him, Jian Wushuang had no such qualms.

“Idiot! ”

Leaving behind these words, Jian Wushuang disappeared once again.

Although he appeared calm on the surface, there was some uncertainty in his heart. One sword strike wouldn’t harm Tian Cang, but Tian Cang could potentially land a punch that could nearly kill him.

A body 50,000-fold against a divine body 59,000-fold was a significant gap.

Even with the suppression from the Origin Source, Jian Wushuang was ultimately just a Dao Lord.

Upon reappearing, Jian Wushuang sheathed the Jueyun Sword, and the black aura around him dissipated, replaced by a swirling green mist.

The power of Life.

This was his most formidable strength.

The vigorous force of Life circulated wildly, and his divine body erupted with immense power, greatly amplifying the Origin Source.

As long as Life endured, strength would be eternal.

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist suddenly and roared, “Tian Cang!’

The sky began to change, and the surrounding seawater reversed its flow.

If the previous skirmish could be considered a warm-up, this was now a serious confrontation.

The aura emanating from him made everyone in the Elder Palace keenly aware.

Many people had already gathered around.

“Look, it’s Jian Wushuang!’

“Why is he fighting someone from Longevity Hall?” someone questioned.

Where there was confusion, there were also those who understood.

The Elder Palace was not that large, and certain matters, once done, were hard to keep under wraps. Crucially, the master of Longevity Hall didn’t conceal anything; instead, he issued invitations and hosted a banquet for all corners.

“You don’t even know about this?”

“l heard it’s the master of Longevity Hall forcibly taking Jian Wushuangs servant! ”

As soon as an experienced elder spoke, another more well-informed person interrupted, “What servant? That person is Gong Miaoyi, a peak-level tier 5 Emperor, not weaker than Jian Wushuang. There’s no way she’s such a strong servant; she must be Jian Wushuangs Dao Companion.”

“What? Dao Companion?”

More spectators gathered at this point.

When they heard that the master of Longevity Hall had taken Jian Wushuangs Dao Companion, everyone became indignant.

“Longevity Hall is going too far!”

The first to support Jian Wushuang were the Inheritors.

Because Jian Wushuang was also an Inheritor.

Naturally, they sided with him.

And he was also a creature of the universe.

The first batch of heirs were fine; in the Four Great Secret Realms, the Elder Palace or the temples, their status was high.

But as more heirs emerged, the Elder Palace no longer valued them.

Especially after the Elder Palace developed so many treasures, attracting numerous Inheritors, it became even more audacious.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Except for a few Inheritors, the rest were treated as Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms.

In places like some treasures, Inheritors should enter for free, but for the sake of immense benefits, there were still under-the-table charges.

Like when Jian Wushuang entered that valley initially, the other party demanded 100 million cubic godstones.

For their own people, however, they didn’t take a single godstone.

For stronger Inheritors, the fees would be somewhat reduced.

Apart from Beiwang Tower and Demon Sound Mountain, the prices in other places were outrageously high.

Obviously, they regarded Inheritors as easy targets.

After all, coming out of the Grave God Mountain, treasures were bound to be on their bodies.

Now, Inheritors had been accumulating grievances for a long time. Longevity Hall had committed these actions, and now that Jian Wushuang and the other party had a dispute, it was evident that most people were on Jian Wushuangs side.

The Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms didn’t dare to take sides recklessly.

These people had no background whatsoever.

Jian Wushuang also sensed many eyes on him and couldn’t help but reveal a slight smile in his heart.

This was exactly what he wanted.

“Tian Cang, since you treat me like this, today, I’ll cut off your dog head!” Jian Wushuang’s aura surged once again.

The power of that punch was enough to rival a top-level tier 6 Emperor.

And this was not the end.

He still had even more powerful cards.

Life Universe!

With a single thought, One Thought Universe was born. Subsequently, it descended with the force of Devouring, coalescing into a black hole. Finally, All Things converged to form the physical universe.

However, the Life Universe encompassed all these forces within itself.

“Rise!”

Within a radius of a million miles, everything was enveloped.

Now, he wasn’t afraid of revealing his trump cards. As long as the Dao Merge was successful, there would be few opponents within the Qishen Temple.

Tian Cang was stunned. A sudden force appeared around him, driving him away, rendering his divine techniques ineffective, and compressing his power continuously.

Unlike the Envoy of All Things, he couldn’t nurture the power of All Things within his body.

In the Life Universe, except for Jian Wushuang, everything was equal.

Even Tian Cang, despite being an Emperor, was just a life form.

For the already suppressed Tian Cang, attempting to withstand the punch from Jian Wushuang was exceedingly difficult.

Boom!

A punch directly shattered Tian Cangs four arms. Subsequently, the enormous fist shadow tore through Tian Cangs chest, leaving a gaping hole.

“Devour!” Jian Wushuangs Thought power gathered, the power of Life dissipated, transforming into immense Devouring force.

A violent surge of divine body power began to leak from Tian Cangs body.

“How is this possible?” Tian Cang was completely stunned.

His divine body was dissipating.

It wasn’t a loss of strength, but the fundamental divine body was dissipating.

Soon, his divine body had decreased by a factor of 100.

At his level, the consumption of a 100-fold divine body required countless treasures, and he felt a deep pang of heartache.

The more he felt the pain, the more Jian Wushuang became frenzied.

Having devoured a 100-fold divine body, the opponent’s 100-fold divine body could now supplement his own 50,000-fold divine body.

Although he had only absorbed 20 percent, equivalent to a 20-fold divine body.

Surprisingly, his own divine body could now ascend by 500-fold.

Currently, it was already 50,500-fold.

Since reaching the perfection of the Extreme Dao, his power of Devouring had transformed into the ability to consume All Things.

He could devour anything, turning it completely into the name of a black hole. This transformation greatly enhanced his power when controlling the black hole.

Originally, there was a considerable gap between him and Emperor Wuyan, but now it had been bridged.

He might actually reach the realm of the black hole before the successful Dao Merge.

If so, once the integration was successful, he would be a peak-level tier 6 emperor, likely possessing a combat strength comparable to that of a supreme-peak expert..
