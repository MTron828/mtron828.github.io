Chapter 2885: Fight With All Your Might

——

“Kill!”

With a roar, Jian Wushuang, who was surging with boundless battle intent, transformed into a sword principle master and charged out with a terrifying aura.

“Be careful! Don’t be careless!”

“This kid is extraordinary!”

World Master Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su did not dare to be careless in the face of Jian Wushuang, the Divine Master.

The three of them had fully displayed their strength.

Boom!

The palm print, which contained limitless destructive power, struck toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not even bother to look at the palm print. Instead, he casually slashed out with his sword.

Then, after channeling the supreme sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, the sword’s power was shocking, and the palm print was instantly shattered.

“Is his swordsmanship so powerful?” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s face darkened.

During their fight with Jian Wushuang, both Heavenly Void Temple Master and Elder Su felt tremendous pressure from Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was too powerful.

Even though his comprehension of the rules, sword principle, and absolute arts were not as good as the three of them when he unleashed his full strength, any of the sword lights that he slashed out were enough to make the three of them pay full attention to it.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and a golden light directly merged into the surrounding void.

In an instant, the world changed.

An actual scroll world appeared out of nowhere in the vast and boundless sky.

There were mountains and rivers in the scroll world, as well as nine towering continents. In addition, an ancient and mysterious aura spread out from the scroll world.

“Is this mysterious?”

World Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su frowned.

When they saw the scroll world, they had a bad premonition.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

Buzz! Buzz!

The surrounding void was transformed in an instant.

The original void had disappeared and was replaced by a desolate and boundless open space. There were many divine swords stuck upside down in this open space. There were all kinds of divine swords, and each of them emitted an extremely terrifying aura.

However, there were over 100,000 divine swords in this vast empty space.

It was obvious that this was a sword tomb, a huge sword tomb!

The thousand treasures great world, the sword path world, had already been activated.

“This, what is this?”

Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Palace Lord, and Elder Su were all at a loss.

“An illusion?” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s expression sank, but he quickly shook his head. “No, this isn’t an illusion, it’s a real space.”

“Seems like the treasure Jian Yi took out earlier should be an extremely powerful treasure, it can actually change the environment.” Elder Su’s eyes were burning.

“In this world, I can clearly sense that the sword Dao in the surroundings is getting stronger. The sword intent emitted by Jian Yi is also much stronger than before. His strength should increase by quite a bit here, we have to be careful.” Heavenly Void Temple Master said solemnly.

The sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword had been guided.

The Mountain River Map and the thousand treasures great world had been displayed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had indeed gone all out and used all his trump cards.

At this moment, his battle strength had also reached its peak!

Boom!

Jian Wushuang attacked again. In the Sword Principle World, the power of his swordsmanship soared again.

His body was also full of fighting spirit as he fought fiercely with the three Immortal Saints in front of him.

Under Jian Wushuang’s full power, although the three Immortal Saints, including Realm Lord Tian Qu, Temple Master Tian Xu, and Elder Su, joined hands, they could only fight evenly with Jian Wushuang for a short time. Even when Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship really erupted… the three of them had to retreat in a one-on-one situation.

This battle was too intense.

Around the battlefield, countless cultivators were standing in the marketplace, looking at the battlefield in astonishment.

The scene on the battlefield had completely exceeded their imagination.

“A mere Divine Master fighting against three Immortal Saints at the same time. How could he fight against three Immortal Saints?”

“He’s too strong. This Divine Master is too strong. The three Immortal Saints, Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su, are only evenly matched with him. If it were a one-on-one fight, none of them would be a match for this Divine Master.”

“How could there be such a terrifying Divine Master in this world? And how come we’ve never heard of such a Divine Master before?”

“Who is this Divine Master? What is his name?”

Countless experts were exclaiming in surprise. At the same time, they were all curious about Jian Wushuang’s identity.

Jian Wushuang had just come from the Pill Sun Sacred World, so the cultivators in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City hardly knew him.

“From their conversation, we can hear that this Divine Master is called Jian Yi. But who is Jian Yi?”

“I don’t know, I’ve never heard of him, but today’s battle will definitely shake the world!”

“Right, a Divine Master is able to fight against three Immortal Saints at the same time and fight equally. If news of this battle spreads, it will shock the world. Even that Young Phoenix from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion might not be able to compare to him.”

The eyes of most of the cultivators in the market were shining.

The Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was recognized as the number one genius in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. She was a true genius, and her talent was unparalleled in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. However, now that Jian Wushuang had shown such a terrifying result, everyone was impressed.

Naturally, these people began to compare Jian Wushuang with Phoenix.

In this competition, they found that although Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the rules and talent was not as good as Phoenix’s, in terms of fighting strength and ability to challenge opponents of higher levels, he was much more terrifying than Phoenix.

A Divine Master could fight against three Immortal Saints at the same time. How strong would he be when he broke through to the Immortal Saint-level in the future?

While countless cultivators in the market were gasping in amazement, the battle between the two sides was getting more and more intense.

The three Immortal Saints, including Realm Lord Tianqu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su, did not hold back anymore. They used all their strength and cooperated with each other. Even so, they still could not gain the upper hand after fighting Jian Wushuang for a long time, they still could not gain the upper hand.

This made the three of them look a little embarrassed.

After all, they were fighting in front of so many people. The three Immortal Saints were fighting against a Divine Master, and they were bullying the weak. However, they could not defeat him after such a long time, which made the three of them feel ashamed.
