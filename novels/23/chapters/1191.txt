Chapter 1192: Battle!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How audacious of the light of a firefly to contend with the splendor of the sun and moon.”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom sneered when he saw Samsara Temple Master making his move, a lance already in hand.

The dark-as-ink lance emanated a terrifying aura. It was a lance that was condensed purely out of Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s power.

He followed suit in taking a step forward.

The moment he stepped out, the pitch-black lance had already transformed into a pitch-black lightning bolt. The lighting bolt immediately pierced the Void with an explosion.

“Boom!” The lighting bolt caused an immense black hole to form in the Void.

The black hole began expanding at an astonishing speed and reached hundreds of thousands of miles in no time.

Inside this black hole, the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s lance had already collided with Samsara Temple Master’s most powerful move.

“Clang!”

The collision caused an earth-shattering sound.

Out of the nine Tao pitch-black ripples from Samsara Temple Master’s strike, three immediately shattered.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth Tao followed suit after.

The eyes of Samsara Temple Master turned bloodshot and underneath the black armor, his face was equally as crazed.

He had given his all in executing the move.

However, sounds of collision reverberated out of the blue!

Two dull sounds of collision reverberated. The seventh and eighth Tao pitch-black ripples also dissipated.

“Insects are still insects at the end of the day.”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom smiled apathetically. Faint light burst out of the pitch-black lance in his hand, causing its power to heighten drastically. The lance then split open the final black ripple and arrive above Samsara Temple Master without losing any power or momentum.

The terrifying impact came drifting toward Samsara Temple Master. Even with his black armor greatly weakening the impact, he nevertheless still made a quiet groan. The Qi and blood in him were boiling, causing blood to spew from his mouth.

“Swoosh!”

Like an artillery shell, his body subsequently exploded.

“Samsara!”

Void Temple Master, Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, and Red Lotus all turned pale with fright.

Samsara Temple Master was unmistakably the strongest out of the five of them. They were stunned that he was still forced to retreat after using his strongest move on the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

“How is that a shred of consciousness is this strong?” Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword cried in shock.

It had not been long since he abruptly ascended the throne. He was not involved in the war five million years ago and thus did not see how the Monarch of Jin Kingdom had wiped the battlefield clean back then.

Jian Wushuang, who stood some distance away, narrowed his eyes.

“Even though the Puppet Fighter that carries his consciousness is only at the Universe Master level and the power he unleashed would be at a similar level, his realm is too high. The might of the Tao that he created, as well as the numerous secret skills that he possesses, surpassed what we have!”

“In summary, his battle prowess is certainly at the peak of a Universe Master—the Supreme Universe Master level!”

“Supreme Universe Master? I’m also one!”

“I believe I’m the only one out of the entire Green Fire Palace to stand a fighting chance against him. Since that’s the case…”

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands, battle intent slowly but fiercely surging within him.

“Fight!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Following the yelling.

Right at the next moment, Jian Wushuang had already floated outward.

“You Palace Masters play a critical role in the Green Fire Palace. If I can kill you all now, it’ll be so much easier for my army to sweep you all clean.” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom gave a light chuckle as he stared at Samsara Temple Master and the rest. In his eyes was a hint of killing intent.

Just then…

“Buzz!”

A faint sword echo resounded in the air and an incomparably “egotistical” aura immediately locked onto the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

“Hm?” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom turned around with a raised eyebrow.

Samsara Temple Master and the rest also heard the sword echo and immediately turned to look at the source of the sound.

“Jian Wushuang?”

They were all stupefied.

Their expressions changed drastically when they saw Jian Wushuang flying straight toward the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

“Don’t be hasty, Jian Wushuang! Hurry up and retreat!”

“Jian Wushuang, you’re not his match! Hurry up and run!”

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be stupid!”

The five Palace Masters cried out at the same time, asking Jian Wushuang to retreat.

What a joke! The Monarch of Jin Kingdom managed to force Samsara Temple Master to back off even after the latter had used all of his strength. Clearly, the former possessed strength superior to theirs.

Their only choice was to work together and pay the price of sacrificing one or two of them to eliminate the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness.

Going one-on-one was no different from digging one’s own grave.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes remained steely even after hearing the cries of the five Palace Masters, showing no desire whatsoever to retreat.

The Jin Kingdom experts began to sneer. “How interesting! Hotspurs like him are a rare sight in the Eternal Chaotic World. It’s only in completely isolated places like this that we can see something like this.”

“Since you’re so desperate to be the first to die, I’ll grant your wish.”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom made his move after speaking.

Once again, he took a step forward and thrust the pitch-black lance in his hand in the next moment.

“Boom!” The terrifying might caused the world to tremble.

The surviving Universe Masters and Celestial Masters of the Jin Kingdom quaked in fear from the bottom of their hearts when they sensed this formidable might.

There was a rupture in the Void as the pitch-black lance directly penetrated Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang’s figure had also abruptly halted.

His eyes seemed to be burning with fire as they stared fixedly at the pitch-black lance. He had already lifted the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

The moment he lifted his sword, a buzzing sound resounded and the entire world plunged into darkness.

Everything fell into darkness and nothingness. There was no longer any light to be seen.

The world also fell into complete stillness.

“Hm?” Flabbergasted, the Monarch of Jin Kingdom raised his head.

He happened to see Jian Wushuang swinging his sword at him.

This swing was accompanied by a dazzling ray of light.

The dazzling light radiated the world as if it was the first light of dawn rising from the end of the horizon.

After 1,800 years of earnest cultivation, this was the strongest move that Jian Wushuang could produce.

It was a sword movement in the Supreme Secret level… Dawn had arrived!

“Supreme Secret?”

The eyes of Monarch of Jin Kingdom glinted and the might of the lance immediately exploded.

“Kaboom!”

The change of the world caused all living things to tremble.

The experts in the area couldn’t help shrieking in their hearts.

“That’s…”

Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, Red Lotus, and the five Palace Masters widened their eyes. They all stared fixedly at the scene before them. To be more precise, they were staring at the hint of dawn unfolding in the boundless darkness.

Under everyone’s focused gaze, two terrifyingly powerful forces collided with one another!
