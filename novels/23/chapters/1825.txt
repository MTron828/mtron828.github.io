Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, I will let you know today that you are only a joke in front of me,” Emperor God Fan Yuan’s voice was cold. Then, there was a fiery-red spear that appeared in his hand.

Rumble. A vast aura spread from his body.

Emperor God Jin Ming next to him revealed a cold smile. He knew Emperor God Fan Yuan’s fighting power clearly. The sixty-second place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list? That had been so many years ago.

“I shall see then,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“I will not disappoint you,” Emperor God Fan Yuan smirked and suddenly moved.

He moved and left a unique trace in the void. When he appeared again, he was in front of Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he held his spear with both hands and there was an ancient crimson ape that was roaring and giving out an intense, bloodthirsty aura.

“Crimson God Nine Spear!”

“Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!””Die!”

He spat the word nine times continuously and every word he uttered was heavy. The crimson spear in his hands stabbed out simultaneously too.

There was a total of nine stabs and every stab could break the void easily and shook the universe.

Crimson clouds swept out and the entire sky was covered in crimson storm.

Crimson God Nine Spear was Emperor God Fan Yuan’s famous unique skill!

Emperor God Fan Yuan attacked with full force when he attacked.

Looking at the nine spear shadows bursting at him like lightning, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and Blood Mountain Sword suddenly was out of its scabbard.

Wow!

The sword shimmered and greeted the nine spear shadows.

Both collided in an instant.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Nine deep clashes rang out almost simultaneously. When it stopped, the entire void collapsed and there was a black hole that spread across a few million miles.

The black hole swallowed everything in the universe. The terrifying strangling strength could easily tear anyone below Sir God level into pieces.

In the core of the black hole, Emperor God Fan Yuan held a spear with one hand as his eyes glowed with soaring murderous intention and his body gave out a bloodthirsty aura. He stared at the void in front of him.

“Did he die?” Emperor God Jin Ming looked.

Emperor God Fan Yuan’s Crimson God Nine Spear, one was stronger than another. The nine spears stabbed out simultaneously. Unless one was a Peak Emperor God, there shouldn’t be anyone who could block head-on.

From Emperor God Jin Ming’s viewpoint, as Jian Wushuang had opted to take the earlier hit head-on, even if he didn’t die, he definitely would have been severely injured.

But then… Vroom! A cold sword light tore down all hindrances in front and pierced the storm that was substantiated with divine power. Then, a figure walked out slowly after the sword light.

“What?” Emperor God Fan Yuan’s face changed.

“He was perfectly fine?” Emperor God Jin Ming was shocked.

“Emperor God Fan Yuan, you spoke so confidently, but your power is only at this level?” Jian Wushuang walked to him slowly and he smirked in disdain. There was no trace of injury on his body.

Emperor God Fan Yuan’s face grew in distress. “It seems that I have belittled you. Well, it’s true. The entire Sanctuary Alliance said that your power has increased tremendously over the years. If so, you are qualified to try my strongest move.”

“Strongest move?” Jian Wushang smiled faintly.

“Fan Yuan, are you going to use that move?” Emperor God Jin Ming quivered.

Emperor God Fan Yuan’s strongest unique skill derived from an opportunity that he had obtained over the years. Through many years of comprehension, he had created that move and it had not been long since he had created it.

Emperor God Jin Ming was fortunate enough to witness someone strong enough to impress him and Emperor God Fan Yuan was going to perform his strongest move…

“Jian Wushuang, die!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

There was a loud roar and Emperor God Fan Yuan’s vigor rose suddenly and he looked just like a bloody person. The crimson spear in his hands burst out a strange, monstrous light and it pierced the void. There was a distance of tens of thousands of miles but the crimson spear suddenly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

A spear stabbed out that could destroy heaven and split the earth!

Jian Wushuang had an illusion as though he was locked up, and no matter how he dodged, the spear would stab his heart.

“This spear is not too shabby.”

Jian Wushuang nodded but in the next moment, he lifted his right hand and pointed in the direction of the crimson spear.

In the direction he pointed, his fierce Ultimate divine power and bloodline power of seven-star ancient tribe exploded without holding back.

The bolt of strength had already surpassed an ordinary Emperor God by too much.

Jian Wushuang was performing the seventh finger of Ancient God… Vault of Heaven’s Finger!

A spacetime whirlpool that covered the expanse of a hundred thousand miles appeared from nowhere. The spacetime whirlpool strangled everything in the universe and in the whirlpool, a huge ancient finger extended. The only difference was that the ancient finger was no longer in a dark golden but a black jade luster.

Ancient God was part of the bloodline under ancient tribe. If the unique skills that Ancient Gods possessed were to be performed by an ancient tribe, it would be even more powerful.

Hong!

There was a loud noise and spacetime shook.

The entire universe was trembling from the terrifying hit.

“How is it possible?”

Emperor God Fan Yun suddenly stared as he could feel a terrifying power approaching him. The power collided with his spear and the strongest killer move that he had performed with all his strength had the lower hand. Soon, his strongest move collapsed.

As for the black jade finger that extended, part of its power hit his body. The impact shook his body and he retreated continuously.

The strongest move that he had performed with his all was defeated by Jian Wushuang?!

“It’s impossible. Besides a Peak Emperor God, there shouldn’t be anyone else who could match me evenly. Has Jian Wushuang already reached the level of Peak Emperor God?” Emperor God Fan Yuan looked shocked.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang wiped off the divine power storm before him and his cold eyes met Emperor God Fan Yuan’s. “Emperor God Fan Yuan, you are really powerful. You are slightly stronger than Emperor God Xue Gu who forced me into a desperate situation. However, it’s a pity that no matter if it is Emperor God Xue Gu or you, neither of you pose any threat to me.”

“Emperor God Xue Gu? Did you fight with Emperor God Xue Gu? What happened to him?” Emperor God Xue Gu asked.

“Emperor God Xue Gu died long ago. Emperor God Jin Ming and you will head down to keep him company now,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but his smile was extremely cold. He didn’t want to waste any more time on the two Emperor Gods.

“Let’s get this done quickly!”

There was a flash of murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, hong!

A terrifying divine power exploded with a tinge of shocking Spacetime Power.

“Secret Skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill!”
