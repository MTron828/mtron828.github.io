4134 Lord River Spirit

Looking at the dao-Enlightenment River, which was rich in both heaven and earth principles and universe principles, Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction. Seeing that there was no one around, he stepped into the river without thinking too much.

In a few seconds, Jian Wushuang reached the deepest part of the river. In the next moment, Jian Wushuang crossed his legs and closed his eyes, allowing his body to gradually sink.

Gulp.

A bubble appeared on the surface of the river. In just a moment, Jian Wushuang disappeared from the surface of the river and sank to the bottom.

At the bottom of the river, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged and took out the lower-grade principle divine fruit he had gotten from Ninth Kalpa King. However, as soon as he took out the principle divine fruit, he frowned. He seemed to have sensed something and could not help narrowing his eyes.

Then, as if nothing had happened, Jian Wushuang put the two low-grade principle divine fruits aside and slowly closed his eyes.

One day...two days...three days...

Jian Wushuang seemed to have sunk into a deep level of cultivation.

At some point in time, in the darkness behind Jian Wushuang, a little old man who was less than five inches tall, slightly hunched, and had two small mustaches slowly walked toward Jian Wushuang.

The little old man stood on his tiptoes with shifty eyes. He came behind Jian Wushuang and carefully looked at him. Seeing that Jian Wushuang had really sunk into a deep level of cultivation, he let out a long breath, he straightened his back and swaggered toward Jian Wushuang.

However, when he reached out his hand and grabbed the two lower-grade divine fruits beside Jian Wushuang, his vision suddenly turned dark.

“Got you.” A cold voice came.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with a cold gleam and lifted the little old man up.

“Wu wu wa wa wa wa...” The little old man was lifted by Jian Wushuang in the hand, suddenly he waddled up.

“Shut up.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold, and he gently exerted force on the little old man. The little old man suddenly stopped screaming and glared at Jian Wushuang with his small eyes. He gnashed his teeth and said, “Boy, do you know who I am?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, and a hint of surprise flashed across his face.

The little old man’s cultivation was not very high. He was probably at the level of the first Ruler, but there was a strange power in his body.

Although he had just squeezed lightly, with his current strength, even an ordinary second-level Ruler would be crushed by him. It was strange that the little old man was not hurt at all.

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang replied calmly, suppressing his thoughts.

“What? Your elders didn’t tell you who I am when you came here?” The little old man was stunned, then he glanced at Jian Wushuang and said, “Let me tell you, I am the River Ruler of the dao-Enlightenment River. Lord River Spirit!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“River Spirit?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the little old man suspiciously. He had never heard from Ruler Blood Wave that there was a River Spirit in the Enlightenment River.

Could he be a liar?

“Boy, how dare you treat me like this? Do you know that you have already caused a big trouble? If you know what’s good for you, you should let me go. By the way...” River Spirit puffed up his chest, he pointed at the two lower-grade divine fruits beside Jian Wushuang and said with shining eyes, “Give me these two lower-grade divine fruits and I’ll forgive your rudeness. Otherwise, Humph, you’ll bear the consequences!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help laughing out of anger. He narrowed his eyes and said, “You’ve caused a big trouble? You’ll bear the consequences? I’d like to see how you make me bear the consequences!”

After saying this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. He pointed his finger like a sword and shot out a sword light, fiercely slashing toward the River Spirit.

Rumble.

The Enlightenment River was directly split open by 300 meters!

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, the River Spirit immediately cried out in surprise and hurriedly tried to dodge to the side.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s cultivation of sword principle was now so profound that it was impossible for the River Spirit, who was only a first-level Ruler, to dodge it?

Before the River Spirit could dodge to the side, the sword light directly cut the River Spirit into two pieces.

Splash!

The River Spirit was cut into two pieces. The river water twisted and countless principles and universe principles spread out. In just a few breaths, the River Spirit’s body kept regenerating and was ‘resurrected’ again.

Moreover, the universe principles and universe principles that filled the path-understanding river became stronger.

“Boy, how dare you attack me?”

River Spirit widened his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

It had been a long time since the birth of the Enlightenment River. Since the mysterious Palace Master of the Life Palace had teleported the Enlightenment River to the Life Palace, all the special life forms in the Life Palace had been respectful to him, all of them were respectful to him?

Even Supreme experts were humble to him. They had to prepare gifts for him if they wanted to enter the Enlightenment River to comprehend the fusion principles.

However, this guy had cut him with his sword?

Jian Wushuang did not pay attention to the River Spirit’s angry shout. Instead, he rubbed his chin and looked thoughtful.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s thoughtful look, River Spirit suddenly laughed and said with a crafty look in his eyes, “Boy, do you have no way to deal with me? Hand over the two low-grade principle divine fruits...”

Bang!

Suddenly, a sword light suddenly slashed toward him.

“You bastard!”

Before River Spirit could let out a scream, he was shattered into pieces by the sword light.

After Jian Wushuang struck out with his sword, he looked at the Shattered River Spirit with interest.

He had a guess.

Rumble.

Sure enough, it didn’t take long for River Spirit to regroup again. He was so angry that he stomped his feet and said, “Bastard! How could you attack me one after another? I’m the Honorable River Spirit!”

Jian Wushuang looked at River Spirit, who was cursing from afar, and a strange smile appeared on his face.

As expected.

As the River Spirit’s body was reorganized, the aura of the principle of the dao-Enlightenment River became stronger than before.

If he guessed correctly, the River Spirit was formed by the principle of the will of the dao-Enlightenment River, and it was an immortal existence. As the River Spirit was killed and reorganized by him, the principle of the will in his body was consumed, it was then fed back to the dao-Enlightenment River.

Therefore, every time the River Spirit died, the principle aura in the Enlightenment River became stronger.

“Old man, it seems that you really are the River Spirit of the Enlightenment River.” Jian Wushuang revealed a strange smile.

Seeing the smile on Jian Wushuang’s face, the River Spirit inexplicably shivered.

“You...what are you looking at me like that for?” The River Spirit shrank his neck and rolled his throat.
