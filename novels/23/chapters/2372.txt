Chapter 2373: Mission Assigned

A few figures swept across the void above the Outer Court. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Senior Brothers, this is the Outer Court. As for Junior Brother Wushuang, he lives over there,” said Yin Long humbly as he pointed at Jian Wushuang’s courtyard.

There were five men following behind Yin Long.

All five of them were projecting a powerful aura and were all at the level of Chaotic Divine Demon. The leader amongst them was a jade-faced handsome young man.

The young man was Xiao Heng, an outstanding genius among the core disciples.

Xiao Heng enjoyed a rather high reputation on Narcissus Island, be it in the Outer Court or Inner Court. There were even rumors about the prospect of him getting into the ranks of the Twelve Minor Kings, should his progress continue!

The Twelve Minor Kings were officially recognized as Wusha Territory’s top twelve demons.

“We’ll wait here, go bring him,” said Xiao Heng frostily.

“Aye.” Yin Long nodded and headed towards Jian Wushuang’s courtyard.

After he left...

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, are we really bringing an outer disciple to carry out our mission?” One of the core disciples could not hold back his curiosity.

“Yeah! There are a lot of outer disciples at the Outer Court and many are in Divine Demon Realm or Half-Step Divine Demon Realm, but not many from their younger generation are up to par. As for Yin Long and Qian Xia, they just came in from the Outer Court and were considered their strongest younger disciples. However, they are merely at the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm and their battle abilities are so-so, totally not up to standards.”

“As for that Jian Wushuang, I heard he is younger than Yin Long, and compared to him, has only joined Narcissus Island for a very short time. What kind of capabilities can he possibly possess?” Another core disciple showed his disdain.

Core disciples were generally scornful toward outer disciples as they had always acted with superiority when facing outer disciples.

Although Yin Long had already become a core disciple, he was new and joined the Inner Court through the Outer Court’s Selection. Hence, those few core disciples did not look too highly upon him either.

Such was their attitude towards Yin Long, not to mention Jian Wushuang.

“Stop right there.”

Xiao Heng’s expression turned cold, “It’s not my wish to carry out a mission with an outer disciple, but this mission was assigned directly from the Divine Mystery Pavilion. Furthermore, the list of six has been confirmed. All five of us and that Jian Wushuang is on it, who are we to change it?”

Besides, Jian Wushuang was handpicked by Elder Wujian to carry out the mission with us.”

“Elder Wujian?” The rest of the core disciples’ hearts stirred a little.

“We have already heard that Elder Wujian gave his Elder’s Token to an outer disciple. He even gave him a part of his elixirs and resources. Could that person be Jian Wushuang?”

“It has to be him!”

“Alright, so he used his status to give Jian Wushuang special privilege higher than core disciples. Now, he wants to let him gain some experiences, hence making us his companions. Who does Elder Wujian think we are? Are we bodyguards or escorts?”

The core disciples were rather angry.

However angry as they were, they dared not say anything. After all, with Elder Wujian’s status as an elder from the Circle of Elders, they were in no position to confront him, even if they were Narcissus Island’s geniuses.

Yin Long had brought Jian Wushuang over to their void as they were chatting.

“Senior Brothers, this is Junior Brother Jian Wushuang.” Yin Long introduced.

“I’m Jian Wushuang, a pleasure to meet you. What brings you to find me?” Jian Wushuang was showing quite a bit of humility as well.

Xiao Heng gave Jian Wushuang a frosty glance. “So, you are Jian Wushuang? Your hiding methods are pretty good, I can’t even tell what realm you possess.”

“Haha, merely parlor tricks.” Jian Wushuang smiled mildly and immediately took the initiative to project his divine energy.

As soon as he projected, Xiao Heng and the rest of the five core disciples felt uneasy.

“Middle Stage Chaotic Realm!”

“It is so!”

“Asking us core disciples in Divine Demon Realm to carry out a mission with an outer disciple with only Middle Stage Chaotic Realm? Haha, Elder Wujian really has some imagination.”

“What is this?”

They were very unhappy from the bottom of their hearts and highly dissatisfied with the realm Jian Wushuang was in.

In fact, they were lucky to have seen that. If they had met Jian Wushuang two months earlier, he would only be in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm.

Coincidentally, Jian Wushuang had just reached another breakthrough fairly recently.

“Jian Wushuang,” said Xiao Heng coldly. Normally, if he were to be a bit more polite, he should have called him Junior Brother Jian Wushuang. However, he addressed him only by his name.

“The five of us came here because of a mission assigned directly from the Divine Mystery Pavilion. They have named the five of us and you to carry out the mission. So, come with us.” said Xiao Heng directly.

“Mission? The Divine Mystery Pavilion assigned me to carry out a mission with five Divine Demon Realm core disciples?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed and he even felt that the mission was rather odd.

However, he soon realized that it was most probably Wujian’s doing.

“So, he doesn’t want me to be in tranquility and is forcing me to stand out.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He could understand that.

Wujian personally inducted him into Narcissus Island and gave him his Elder’s Token, a treatment much more privileged than core disciples. Although Wujian did not break any rules on Narcissus Island, it did attract a lot of gossip behind him which created some pressure for Wujian himself.

In a situation such as this, Wujian naturally hoped that Jian Wushuang could show a little of his true colors. However, Jian Wushuang had been lying low which forced Wujian to think of such a method.

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, all of you came searching for Junior Brother Wushuang to carry out a mission with you?” Yin Long was also surprised. He did not realize the reason why Xiao Heng and his company wanted to find Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, come with us,” said Xiao Heng straightforwardly.

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, this is the first time Junior Brother Wushuang goes for a mission since he arrived at Narcissus Island. Would you mind giving him some time to prepare?” said Yin Long humbly.

“Prepare? What would a guy in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm prepare for? Do you really mean that all five of us should stand here and wait for him?” Xiao Heng’s voice was icy-cold.

“Uh...” Yin Long’s expression changed.

“There’s no need to prepare, we can take off now.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Junior Brother Wushuang.” Yin Long looked over.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” Jian Wushuang mildly smiled and went off with Xiao Heng and the lot.
