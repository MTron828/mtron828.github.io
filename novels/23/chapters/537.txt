Chapter 538: Jian Wushuang, You did not Save My Life!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the battlefield, the fierce battle continued.

Jian Wushuang held his Heart-killing Sword tightly and activated the Blood River Realm while the 60-meter-tall Golden Sword Soul Phantom emanated a mighty aura.

He slaughtered the Demonic Beasts with his sword alone. Wherever he went, the Demonic Beasts tried to dodge him, daring not to fight against him.

“Brother Wushuang, good job.”

“Leader!”

“Leader, I love you!”

Qing Huo and the leader of the third squad, as?well as the other sergeants, were ecstatic and excited.

They had prepared to fight to the death after being abandoned by Jin Ling. Nobody had expected Jian Wushuang to suddenly burst out at this critical moment and alleviate their burden on his own.

They were still being attacked by the Demonic Beasts, but it was not as intense as before. Therefore, it became easier for them to counterattack.

“Be careful,” Jian Wushuang reminded them. He turned to look at the breach that was closest to them.

Too many Demonic Beasts had made it into the Formation. Most importantly, an endless swarm of Demonic Beasts was still surging into the Formation through the breach. If the breach was not blocked, the number of Demonic Beasts would only continue to increase.

“We have to block the breach,” Jian Wushuang focused his eyes on the breach.

“Take care of yourselves. I’m going to block the breach,” Jian Wushuang said to Qing Huo before rushing to the breach.

He had just taken a few steps when he suddenly heard urgent and crazy shouts from nearby.

“Get out of my way!”

“Damn it! Go die!”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang turned to look. He narrowed his eyes at the scene that was taking place in front of him.

Jin Ling, who had fled earlier, became the target of some Demonic Beasts. He was currently encircled by four Demonic Beasts, two that were Rank Eight Monsters with the other two being Rank Seven Monsters. He was in a terrible situation.

Jin Ling also saw Jian Wushuang at this time. His eyes immediately lit up.

“Jian Wushuang, help me, help me quickly!” He shouted with anxiety.

Though he was also a Second-grade Divine General, he had not experienced many dangerous situations because he was the son of Emperor Golden Snake.

He had been extremely scared when he was encircled by the Demonic Beasts before. Even now, he was only surrounded by four Demonic Beasts, but he still had no confidence in defeating them and could not display his full strength.

In fact, as long as he was careful, it would not be easy for the Demonic Beasts to kill him.

“Come save me!” Jin Ling roared when he saw that Jian Wushuang had no intention to help him.

“Save you?” Jian Wushuang cast a cold glance at Jin Ling and turned to head for the breach.

“Bastard!”

“You’re leaving me to die!”

Jin Ling’s angry shouts were heard all over the battlefield.

The other sergeants heard Jin Ling’s angry roars, but they just cast a cold glance towards him.

Even the sergeants under the command of Jin Ling remained indifferent.

They clearly saw what happened earlier. Jian Wushuang had selflessly saved Jin Ling’s life, but what did he get in return?

Did he really expect Jian Wushuang to save him again?

Did he think Jian Wushuang was a fool?

“The farmer got bitten by the snake after saving it. I won’t allow it to happen again,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Jin Ling was no different from a poisonous snake.

Jian Wushuang had no intent to save Jin Ling. The other sergeants that were nearby also gave him the cold shoulder.

As the commander and someone who knew Jin Ling’s identity, Fang Han hesitated for a moment. However, he was facing two Rank Eight Monsters at the moment and he had not completely recovered from his wounds. Even if he wanted to save him, he could not.

“Bastard, bastard!”

“No, no!”

Jin Ling’s shrill voice continuously echoed throughout the battlefield. He was struggling desperately while surrounded by four Demonic Beasts, but when two more Rank Seven Monsters joined to attack him, he was completely overcome with despair.

That despair gradually turned into madness and resentment.

“Jian Wushuang! Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s all because of you!”

“You left me to die!”

“Just wait. If I die, you won’t be able to live either!”

He roared hysterically as a Demonic Beast opened its mouth and directly bit off his left arm.

Jin Ling knew he was doomed, so he took out a Messaging Slip with his right hand and broke it.

His voice, filled with endless resentment, was passed on through the slip.

“Father, I’m going to die!”

“It’s Jian Wushuang’s fault!”

“He left me to die!”

“Get revenge me, get revenge for me!”

“Kill him, kill him for me!”

The battlefield reverberated with his crazy voice that was full of endless resentment. The sergeants were astonished.

They saw a Rank Eight Monster suddenly slash its sharp claw on Jin Ling’s head, making it burst like a watermelon. Jin Ling died in an instant.

Though he was dead, his words had been passed through the Messaging Slip.

Jian Wushuang, who was rushing toward the breach, heard his words clearly. He narrowed his eyes slightly, but he did not pay much attention to it.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang arrived at the breach like a peerlessly sharp sword. With a wave of his sword, he instantly killed two Demonic Beasts that had just passed through the breach.

For the remaining time, he stood at the breach. The Demonic Beasts outside were eager to rush into the battlefield, but only two Demonic Beasts could pass through the breach simultaneously and he could kill two Demonic Beasts without effort.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang completely blocked the breach by himself. None of the Demonic Beasts were able to break through his defense and enter the battlefield.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Not far away, several flowing Lights swiftly arrived. They were human sergeants coming to support them.

“Reinforcements are coming.”

The sergeants of the Seventh Army and Sixth Army were overjoyed. They immediately joined forces with the reinforcements and killed the Demonic Beasts that still remained on the battlefield. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The situation immediately became stable.

In Zone No. 14, the human camp had gained the absolute advantage.
