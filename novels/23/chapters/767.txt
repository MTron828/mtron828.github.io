Chapter 768: The Gold-armored Ancient God Jian Wushuang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Yun Fan had transformed into a Demon God!”

“He’s the Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard, was it necessary? He is just battling a Divine Realm expert!”

“This Jian Wushuang…”

The onlookers had already scrambled far away from the fight. All of them had an odd expression as they watched the battle.

Yun Fan, who had transformed into a five-meter Silver-armored Ancient God, stared deadly at Jian Wushuang with his silver-light eyes.

He had never thought that Jian Wushuang would push him to this stage. But after the fight just now, he understood that while Jian Wushuang was just a Divine Realm Expert, his strength was strangely extraordinary.

“Kid, you should be proud of yourself for pushing me to this point, but you should stop now” Yun Fan growled in a low voice.

“Stop now?” Jian Wushuang had a cold impression, even as he saw Yun Fan turn into an Ancient God.

“Well, I don’t think so.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was harsh and cold. As his voice fell, he activated his Bloodline Power instantly.

In just a short moment, he transformed into a 15-meters Gold-armored Ancient God.

Everyone present was startled by the scene.

“What… what’s that?”

“A Gold… Gold-armored Demon God!”

“Oh my God!”

“It’s so huge! I’ve never seen a Demon God this big before.”

The whole place was in an uproar mixed with some angry voices.

“It’s him!”

A purple-haired man from the Boundless Demon Sect cried out in horror. His eyes were widened and he had a fearful expression.

His companions immediately looked towards him and asked, “Kang Jing, you’ve seen him before?”

“Yes, in the Tianqi Mountains. He is the man who killed Xia Yuan,” Kang Jing growled.

When he was adventuring in that mountain with Xia Yuan, An Chao, and another expert, they encountered an extremely terrifying One-star Gold-armored Ancient God. Out of the four of them, he was the only one lucky enough to run away.

During then, he had witnessed how that Ancient God killed Xia Yuan.

Before Jian Wushuang transformed, he did not think of him that way. But now that he had transformed into an Ancient God, Kang Jing recognized him immediately.

He was certain that Jian Wushuang was that Gold-armored Ancient God he had met in the Tianqi Mountains.

His companions were shocked. “You’re saying that Xia Yuan was killed by Jian Wushuang? But it’s impossible, wasn’t he killed by a Demon God?”

“It’s him, it’s him!”

A purple-haired lady shouted in fear from the Immortal Dynasty camp.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had just reached the Tianqi Mountains. His first fight was against the three from Immortal Dynasty. In the end, Jian Wushuang killed two of them. This lady was the one that got away.

Now, she recognized Jian Wushuang as well.

Gradually, the survivors who had encountered Jian Wushuang during the 10 days in the Tianqi Mountains all recognized him.

Two majestic figures were standing far apart from each other on the ground, facing each other.

Though the Silver-armored Ancient God that Yun Fan transformed into was big, it looked tiny in front of the one that Jian Wushuang transformed into.

Yun Fan stared at Jian Wushuang with a gloomy gaze. He spoke with an icy voice, “So you’re the Gold-armored Demon God who stopped me last time, no wonder you attacked me instead of the experts from Ancient Sect.”

“Yes, it was me.” Jian Wushuang admitted to it generously.

“Hehe, you told us that you were hiding in the Eternal Zone for 100 years. Now it seems like it was a complete joke.” Yun Fan sneered and continued. “If what you said was true, how did you get the chance to become a Gold-armored Demon God?”

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang, waiting for his reply.

They were not convinced by what he said before. After seeing Jian Wushuang transform into a Demon God, they were even more certain that Jian Wushuang was hiding big secrets.

“It’s the Gold-armored Demon God!” A number of those in the crowd were eyeing on it.

All the experts in the Firmament Territory had the same desire. It could be a big platform for their strength to increase tremendously.

However, after so many years, only a few of them had transformed into Demon Gods. Furthermore, almost all of them only became Copper-armored Demon Gods.

Yun Fan had the best luck, yet he only transformed into a Silver-armored Demon God.

But now, standing in front of them, someone had transformed into a Gold-armored Demon God.

How could they not be agitated?

Under watchful eyes, Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change. He cast Yun Fan a cold gaze and spoke in a low voice, “You talked too much nonsense. I’ve told you that as long as you defeat me, I’ll follow you to your sect. I’ll then tell you everything that you want to know.”

“Very good, I’ll show you no mercy then.” Yun Fan continued, “I underestimated you just now and let you get an upper hand. But now, things are different. Let me see how much your strength had increased after staying in the Eternal Zone for 100 years, you peerless genius from the Ancient Sect.”

Yun Fan continued standing at the same spot. The jet-black long staff expanded in size while radiating a powerful aura.

The onlookers all nodded at Yun Fan’s words.

They could all see that Yun Fan lost an upper hand because he had not taken Jian Wushuang seriously in the fight just now. Although Jian Wushuang had the ultimate advantage, Yun Fan obviously took him too lightly, despite Jian Wushuang throwing him against the ground twice.

But now, Yun Fan was obviously going to go all out.

“I also would like to know just how strong is the Great Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, the expert from Eternal Realm whose powers are officially known in the Firmament Territory to second my master’s.” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. While he was speaking, the Emperor Sword in his hand had been elongated to 10 meters long and Sword Essences flew in all directions.

A dark golden light was glistening in his eyes. His battle intent was shooting high up into the sky.

Currently, Jian Wushuang’s blood was already boiling.

An angry voice kept echoing at the back of his mind.

“Fight!” “Fight!” “Fight!”

His battle intent was surging and his Sword Essence was overwhelming.

As if feeling Jian Wushuang’s inner turmoil, the nearby onlookers all held their breath.

Everyone was in full concentration as they waited.

The vast heaven and earth were in dead silence at this moment.

It was so quiet that even the sound of a needle dropping could be heard.

Whoosh~ A light wind blew past the Void.

However, this small sound sounded like the sudden beat on the war drum.

At that very moment, the two figures that were far apart on the vast ground, both made a move at the same time.
