Chapter 3591: Crushing

After the blood-red flash appeared, it directly slashed forward. In front of Jian Wushuang were Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor.

These two were the strongest among the five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm. Their attacks were also the strongest, so they were in front of Jian Wushuang.

“He did not retreat when facing the five of us, but chose to face us head-on?”

“He only blocked the attacks of Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor, but he ignored the attacks of the three of us?”

“He’s courting death!”

Anger surged in the eyes of the five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang was underestimating them, especially Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, and the three trapped experts.

After all, the five of them were attacking at the same time, but Jian Wushuang only used his swordsmanship to block the attacks of Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor. However, Jian Wushuang had no intention of blocking the attacks of the other three, he could not block them either.

In other words, whether Jian Wushuang could block the attacks of Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor or not, the attacks of the three of them would definitely hit Jian Wushuang head-on.

Knowing this, Jian Wushuang still did this. He was looking down on the three of them?

“I can suppress him one-on-one, but he still wants to fight five-on-one. What a joke.”

Blood Spirit King felt a trace of disdain in his heart. The blood mist on his right palm rolled, forming a thick blood cloud in an instant.

Blood Saber Emperor still used his mighty and domineering saber move, which was also his strongest move.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang’s blood-red flash collided with the attacks of Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor.

“Bang!”

With a loud sound, the attacks of Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor collapsed as if they were crushing dead wood.

“How is this possible?”

Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor widened their eyes at the same time as they looked at the blood-red flash in front of them.

They had thought that the blood-colored terpsichore was not that strong, and that they could easily deal with it or even defeat it by themselves. However, when the two of them joined hands, they were actually crushed by the blood-colored terpsichore?

Yes, crushed!

Their attacks had completely ended, but there was still more than half of the power of the blood-colored Terpsichore left. This monstrous power swept toward the two of them at the first moment, and in an instant...

“Humph!”

Blood Spirit King groaned. Blood immediately flowed out of the corner of her mouth, and her aura was greatly weakened.

Blood Saber Emperor, on the other hand, was even more miserable. She spat out a large mouthful of blood, completely dyeing the supreme treasure armor on her body red.

The two of them also retreated backward in a sorry state.

This scene shocked the Principles Masters who were watching the battle in the nearby void.

However, they did not have the time to be shocked because the attacks of Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, and Kun Master had already landed on Jian Wushuang.

Thunder Blaze Master held a heavy sword in his hand. The dark world-annihilating divine thunder in the heavy sword rolled and formed a rolling thunder cloud that completely covered Jian Wushuang.

Nine Sword Demon Master’s sword essence was rampant, but there was an extremely cold sword light that silently stabbed toward the back of Jian Wushuang’s head.

As for Kun Master, he swung his sledgehammer and smashed down in a mighty manner.

The three attacks landed on Jian Wushuang at almost the same time, and three astonishing powers burst out in an instant.

When they saw that their attacks had all hit Jian Wushuang, Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, and Kun Master could not help but smile. However, as soon as the smile appeared, it immediately froze.

In front of them, Jian Wushuang, who had been attacked by three attacks at the same time, was covered in a layer of sparkling blood-red armor. Under the powerful attacks of the three of them, the blood-red armor was surging with a thick blood-red light.

As for Jian Wushuang, he slowly raised his head, blinked at the three of them, and smiled strangely.

“What, what’s going on?”

Before the three of them could regain their senses, they found that Jian Wushuang had already made his move.

As soon as he made his move, the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword instantly activated the origin of the sword principle universe. The power of the first level of the Blood Demon Cave Armor, which was at the pinnacle of the six realm, was completely unleashed.

Whoosh!

A violent blood-red sword shadow swept across the area. After the sword shadow took shape, it directly formed a raging purple flame and instantly covered the area.

It was Jian Wushuang’s most powerful ultimate skill, Starfire Burning Sun!

“This is...”

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s sword skill, the three people in front of them were stunned.

They had been at the pinnacle of the six realm for many years, so they were very knowledgeable. As soon as Jian Wushuang’s sword skill was used, they immediately recognized the special mystery and power contained in it.

“A seventh-level absolute art?”

“An absolute art at the Ruler Realm?”

Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, and Kun Master widened their eyes as they watched the sword crushing toward them. They were terrified, and they tried their best to resist.

However, although it was one against three, the power of a seventh-level absolute art was far beyond their imagination.

Moreover, after Jian Wushuang activated the first level of the Blood Demon Cave Armor, his strength at the peak of the six realms was much stronger than any of them. Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s sword skill contained the Universe Origin of Sword Principle...

Boom!

A shocking explosion sounded. A world-shaking power burst out from the purple flames like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years. It was so powerful that it could destroy the world in an instant, it almost instantly broke the attacks of the three of them. Then, it continued to attack their divine bodies.

The three of them were experts at the pinnacle of the sixth realm. They were rich, and their bodies were protected by armor at the level of a top-tier universe supreme treasure. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, they were only top-tier universe supreme treasures, not top-tier supreme treasures like Jian Wushuang’s Blood Demon Cave Armor. When faced with an attack at Jian Wushuang’s level, they could only weaken the power by 80 percent at most, however, the remaining power still caused a devastating blow to their divine bodies.

Buzz!

Without a sound, the divine body of Master Kun directly collapsed. After it collapsed, it did not even have the chance to regenerate. All of its divine power had been wiped out.

Kun Master died on the spot!

As for Thunder Blaze Master and Nine Sword Demon Master, they had stronger protective skills. However, under the impact of such power, although they did not die on the spot, 60-70% of their divine power was immediately annihilated!

“Oh my God!”

Thunder Blaze Master and Nine Sword Demon Master were scared out of their wits at this moment. They immediately turned around and intended to escape.

However, Jian Wushuang did not make a move, so he naturally would not show mercy. When he killed Kun Master at the first moment, he had already set his eyes on the second person.

This person was Nine Sword Demon Master!
