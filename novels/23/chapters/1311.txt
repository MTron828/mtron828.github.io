Chapter 1312: Scarlet Kingdom!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang understood the first level of Scarlet Kingdom in three days. Although the following second, third and fourth levels of the secret skill were more difficult than the first, Jian Wushuang found it rather easy to understand.

A year passed by very quickly.

Before the stele, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and a bright light swept out.

Vroom!

A terrifying crimson flame surged and formed a huge scarlet sea fire which filled the universe.

Jian Wushuang was right in the core of the scarlet sea fire. The surrounding crimson flame that filled the air was submitted to him and he became the ruler of the scarlet sea fire!

“Such a strong power. This is Scarlet Kingdom. It feels rather similar to Realm techniques,” Jian Wushuang looked around in astonishment.

However, Scarlet Kingdom was different from Realm techniques after all.

Realm techniques were a great technique to suppress opponents and weaken their power.

But Scarlet Kingdom wouldn’t pressure the opponent. Even when the opponent was right in the core of sea fire, he wouldn’t be affected much. However, Jian Wushuang who was in the sea fire would be able to perform stronger swordsmanship.

Among the scarlet sea fire that filled the air, Jian Wushuang stood up and the Blood Mountain Sword was already in his hands.

Jian Wushuang wielded the sword and there was immediately a bolt of lightning. An explosion of terrifying power, and there was immediately a twisted black hole in the scarlet sea fire.

“The power…” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

He could clearly sense the tremendous increment of his power in swordsmanship.

The increment was about seventy percent more!

Seventy percent was already quite significant.

“No wonder even though the Master of Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture are both Universe Gods in the Second Heaven but they couldn’t win against the Master of Scarlet Island. It is because the Master of Scarlet Island possesses the secret skill of Scarlet Kingdom and the moment he carries out the secret skill, his overall power would increase by seventy percent straightway!”

“And, merely the first level could be so strong. The following second, third and fourth, would only be stronger!” Jian Wushuang gasped with admiration.

Of course, although he understood all four levels of the secret skill, he could only really perform the first level of the secret skill.

As for the second level of Scarlet Kingdom, maybe he could only be qualified to perform it after he become a Universe God when he passed the Inverse Cultivation Test.

“With Scarlet Kingdom, my overall power increased tremendously again. I am even more confident to pass the Inverse Cultivation Test!” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly together. After he understood all four levels of the secret skill, he didn’t continue to stay but got up to leave.

When he arrived outside the cave dwelling, Jian Wushuang saw the Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying that were waiting outside.

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Jian Wushuang?” The Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying were both shocked to see Jian Wushuang.

“You came out so quickly?”

“How long has it been?”

From what the Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying said, even though Jian Wushuang was extremely gifted, it would require at least ten years time to understand the first level of Scarlet Kingdom.

But it had only been a year.

“You have mastered the first level secret skill?” The Master of Scarlet Island asked in disbelief.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “Not only have I understood the first level, but I’ve also understood the latter three levels too.”

“Four levels of secret skill, you understood them all?”

The Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying stared.

“Understood all four levels of secret skill in one year? How is it possible?” The Master of Scarlet Island was astonished.

One must know that he himself had spent almost three thousand years on only understanding the first level of secret skill, and he had yet to understand the second level of secret skill until then.

Jian Wushuang understood all four levels of secret skill in one year?

Merely a year?

We were all human, why are we so different?

“Monster!”

The Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying looked at each other in surprise and could only describe Jian Wushuang with that particular word.

“Jian Wushuang, the most impressive thing about the Scatletian was the secret skill, Scarlet Kingdom. It is also the only thing that we could help you with. The rest of the things depend on yourself,” the Master of Scarlet Island said.

“Mm.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

He was very clear that understanding Scarlet Kingdom really did increase his power quite a bit. But even with the secret skill, he still couldn’t undergo the Inverse Cultivation Test with no worries.

He still had to get ready!

He still had to continue to increase his power.

He focused on increasing his level of swordsmanship.

Jian Wushuang returned to where he had stayed in Dayu Palace. In the secret room, the Little Scattered Stars Game was before Jian Wushuang and he started studying and resolving it again.

He resolved thirty-five moves the previous time and then he continued to resolve the chess game from thirty-sixth move onwards.

Then, he obviously had more time compared to the previous time.

Vroom!

The scene fast forwarded.

Again, there was a boundless land covered in white. At the far front of the land, there was a figure in a white robe standing there.

The moment Jian Wushuang saw the white robe, the figure withdrew his long sword and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t feel the existence of any Sword Principle but he could merely depend on his understanding towards nature of swordsmanship to resolve the problem before him.

While Jian Wushuang was resolving it, he continued to accumulate experience like before.

He immersed himself in resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game.

As time flew past…

The Little Scattered Stars Game was extremely profound and every thirty three steps marked a threshold.

Under normal situation, a Universe God in the First Heaven of a top genius level, could spend ten years and resolve the thirty-third move. However, every move after that represented a level higher. In a twenty year time period, one might not even resolve the fortieth move, and in a hundred years… One might only be wandering around over forty moves.

Jian Wushuang started resolving from the thirty-sixth move and he spent a hundred years on the chess set.

After a hundred years, the fifty-first black chess gradually disappeared from the Little Scattered Stars Game before Jian Wushuang.

The fifty-first move was resolved!

Until then, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

“The fifty-first move is finally resolved,” Jian Wushuang sighed, “In a hundred years, from the thirty-fifth move to the fifty-fifty-first move. I only resolved sixteen moves?”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t pleased with the outcome.

However, King of Venomous Worms who was in his body spoke, “Jian Wushuang, you think the Little Scattered Stars Game is easy? Don’t forget that to you, just a Universe Master, this is too high of a level. To be able to resolve the fifty-first move in a hundred year’s time, it’s incredibly good. How dare you dream for more?”

“Mm. True that,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “It’s nearer to my Inverse Cultivation Test. There is only a decade left. I have to make use of the last decade wisely!”
