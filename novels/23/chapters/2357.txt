Chapter 2358: Great Compassion Sect, Brahman Sword Fairy!

“Wu Jian. You came down all the way to the Anjiu Prefecture and you did not even tell me? I am the Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture.” The man smiled warmly. It was as though he was having a casual chat with a friend.

“I heard that you shut yourself off from the rest of the world to cultivate. How can I disturb you?” Wu Jian said.

The Commandery Governors within the Wusha Barren Region were voted by the various clans.

These Commandery Governors were powerful. Most of these Commandery Governors were tier two Chaotic Divine Demons. There were also Commandery Governors who were tier one Chaotic Divine Demons.

The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture was a tier one Chaotic Divine Demon. Both of them were in the same realm, hence Wu Jian did not put up a front.

“I did shut myself off. However, an important figure came to visit. I had to welcome him.” The Anjiu Prefecture Commandery Governor said. He told Wu Jian half the truth.

It was true that he welcomed an important figure. After the important figure left, the Commandery Governor announced he would continue to shut himself off to cultivate. In reality, he did not do so.

“Important figure? Who?” Wu Jian asked.

“A Golden Deacon from the Great Compassion Sect.” The Commandery Governor said.

“Great Compassion Sect?” Wu Jian’s iris constricted in shock.

After the cultivators within the Lin Mansion heard the words: Great Compassion Sect, they were in awe.

There were numerous clans in the Wusha Barren Region.

The Water Fairy Island was considered extremely powerful and was ranked the top three among all clans.

However, the most powerful and respected clan in the Wusha Barren Region was without a doubt the Great Compassion Sect.

It was known by everyone as the most powerful clan in the Wusha Barren Region!

“A Golden Deacon from the Great Compassion Sect. He should be a tier two Chaotic Divine Demon. Even though he comes from the Great Compassion Sect, he should not be considered an important figure, no?” Wu Jian said.

“That is true. However, this Golden Deacon was sent here by the ancient elder from the Great Compassion Sect who is an expert in the sword doctrine.” The Commandery Governor smiled and said.

“An ancient elder who is an expert in sword doctrine? You mean Brahman Sword Fairy?” Wu Jian was shocked.

The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture smiled.

Wu Jian felt something stuck in his throat.

Brahman Sword Fairy was an unbelievably powerful super expert.

Many of the cultivators present did not know who he was as they were far too weak. However, Wu Jian, who was a tier one Chaotic Divine Demon and had great status within the Water Fairy Island, knew exactly who the Brahman Sword Fairy was.

He was a superpower who was above the Divine Demon Realm.

Furthermore, the Brahman Sword Fairy was called a sword cultivator. His understanding of the Sword Doctrine was extremely deep and profound!

He should be the most powerful sword cultivator in the Wusha Barren Region.

“The almighty Brahman Sword Fairy sent someone to the Anjiu Prefecture personally? What is he after?” Wu Jian asked.

“For someone.” The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture smiled as he pointed at Jian Wushuang. “For him!”

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was lost.

Even though Jian Wushuang had never heard of the Brahman Sword Fairy before, he could guess a thing or two from Wu Jian’s reactions.

Even so, Jian Wushuang shouldn’t have met such a big figure before.

“Wu Jian. Let me tell you the truth. I recommended this little one called Jian Wushuang to the Great Compassion Sect a long time ago.” The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture said.

“What?” Wu Jian knitted his eyebrows.

“You might not know this: his name was given to him by Taoist Priest Xuan Shen. That man is one of the most mysterious and powerful men I have ever met. Ever since this little one was born, I have been taking note of him. He stayed lowkey previously, which was why I too remained passive. However, three years ago, the little one fought a battle near the Lin Mansion. I only knew he attained Great Achievement in the Sword Doctrine Realm after he crushed Zhuge Hong from the Zhuge Family with his sword skills!”

The Commandery Governor from the Anjiu Prefecture stopped for a moment before he continued, “Back then, he was only sixteen when he attained Great Achievement in the Sword Doctrine Realm. How incredible was his innate talent? Since then, I have contacted several clans over the years. Even though these clans gave very attractive conditions, I felt like something was missing.”

“This situation lasted until not too long ago when I contacted the Brahman Sword Fairy from the Great Compassion Sect!”

“You mean that the Brahman sent someone over to bring the little one to the Great Compassion Sect?” Wu Jian knitted his eyebrows and asked.

“Yes and no. Even though the little one is extremely talented, the people from the Great Compassion Sect have yet to see it with their own eyes. It was based on my words alone. They needed to verify what I had said. The Great Compassion Sect wants me to bring the little one to the Great Compassion Sect to take a series of tests. If he passes them all, the Brahman Sword Fairy will take him in as his lineal disciple!!”

“Is that the case?” Wu Jian understood the situation. However, his frown deepened.

“After all, I have also heard about what this little one did in the Lin Mansion. I was also not sure about the rumors. Hence, I came down personally and saw the little one kill Chaotic Divine Demons easily while he was only in the Chaotic Realm. Without a doubt, his talent was much more incredible than what I knew.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It will be extremely easy for him to pass the tests at the Great Compassion Sect given how talented he is. He will also become the lineal disciple of the Brahman Sword Fairy.”

The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture smiled, “Wu Jian, I know that the Water Fairy Island also wants to recruit this little one. However, the Great Compassion Sect is still a better choice for his development and growth.”

“Humph. That might not be true. I admit that the Water Fairy Island is not as powerful as the Great Compassion Sect. However, the ability of a clan to nurture and develop experts has nothing to do with its power. Some weak clans can also nurture top tier experts.”

“Furthermore, the Water Fairy Island has a very solid foundation. We can provide the little one with the same amount, or even more, resources that the Great Compassion Sect will. As long as the little one is willing to go back to the island with me, I am sure my island master is willing to take him as his lineal disciple as well.”

“It is different. Even though the island master of the Water Fairy Island is powerful, sword doctrine is not his expertise. On the other hand, Brahman Sword Fairy is the most powerful sword cultivator in the Wusha Barren Region. This little one has incredible talent in sword doctrine. He can only realize his full potential in the sword doctrine under the personal guidance of the Brahman Sword Fairy.” The Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture shook his head slightly and said.
