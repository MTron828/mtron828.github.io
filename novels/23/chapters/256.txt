Snow continued to fall.

The unprecedented battle continued on the Heartless Island.

There were only three people left, Jian Wushuang, Lin Xiaonan, and Qi Luosheng. Wang Yuan and other experts of Blood Feather Tower had stopped stepping in and stood outside the island to watch this unprecedented battle.

The entire Heartless Island was filled with jubilation, when all the spectators saw Jian Wushuang fighting against the two super experts of the Saint Realm.

“Oh God, he’s fighting against two!”

“He’s fighting with the two super experts of Divine Transcendence and remains neck and neck with them.”

“How is this possible? How could Jian Wushuang be so strong?”

“Jian Wushuang lives up to his name; he is peerless. He is 20, right? As a 20-year-old man, he could cut off the hand of an expert of the Saint Realm, and could fight against two experts of the Saint Realm... It’s incredible!”

“Monster, a real Monster!”

“Such a Monster has never appeared since our Tianzong Dynasty was established.”

Countless experts marveled at it.

The younger generation of warriors were in a complete frenzy.

“Jian Wushuang, amazing!” Ling Feng from the Tianyuan Sword Sect was howling, his hands grasped together. His mania and worship for Jian Wushuang had reached a new peak.

“Incredible! I’ve lived for so long and have never seen a peerless genius like him. Our Tianyuan Sword Sect is famous for Sword Principle. If our sect could have a genius at just half of Jian Wushuang’s strength, I can die without any regrets,” A white-haired elder with a young face, who was Sect Master from the Tianyuan Sword Sect, said.

Jian Meng’er was petrified by those words.

After all, Jian Wushuang had numerous ties to her.

She had already been shocked by the achievement Jian Wushuang had obtained. Now she felt completely desperate.

She was well aware that Jian Wushuang was now so strong that he could single-handedly exterminate her Tianyuan Sword Sect.

Above the Void not far from the Heartless Island, a grey-robed elder stood quietly and stared at the unprecedented battle. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“He’s only 20 years old and can already fight against the super experts by himself. Even though he used some special tactics, it’s miraculous. Our young master’s brother is great indeed.”

The grey-robed elder was the sixth Elder from Alchemy School. Even he was greatly shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength.

There were two figures standing above another Void.

One was Di Xi, Monarch of the Tianzong Dynasty; the other was a red-robed man.

The red-robed man looked younger than Di Xi, but Di Xi stood behind the red-robed man, showing a hint of respect for the red-robed man. After all, the red-robed man was the real pillar of the Tianzong Dynasty. He was the founding emperor of the Tianzong Dynasty and the creator of Formless Swordsmanship, which meant that he had been a super expert of Divine Transcendence for hundreds of years.

The red-robed man was named Hong Xuzi.

“An amazing kid.” Hong Xuzi could not help exclaiming while watching what happened in the battlefield.

“Your Majesty, should we really be just watching like this?” Di Xi could not help but ask.

“What else can we do? ” Hong Xuzi replied with a hint of resignation, “I want to save him, but once I step in, I will be in trouble with Holy Emperor Palace. Our Tianzong Dynasty is just a small empire in the Nanyang Continent and doesn’t have a backer. How can we piss off the Holy Emperor Palace?”

On hearing this, Di Xi’s expression changed.

Indeed, the Tianzong Dynasty was not a super force like the Alchemy School or Ice Nether Valley.

If they offended Holy Emperor Palace, Holy Emperor Palace could easily wipe them out.

“Alas, our Tianzong Dynasty finally has such a genius. Unfortunately, he has pissed off the Holy Emperor Palace. I’m afraid it will be his last fight.” Hong Xuzi shook his head.

“The last fight? Your Majesty, hasn’t Jian Wushuang been neck and neck with them?” Di Xi asked, voice filled with doubt.

“Yes, he has, but it won’t stay that way for long.” Hong Xuzi still shook his head. “I know the kid has improved his strength greatly because of a special tactic. It should be a Cultivation Method or a special Martial Arts Technique, which can absorb natural power to serve himself.

“It breaks the natural balance, so it will cause severe damage to his body. He won’t be able to sustain this for long.

“Moreover, Lin Xiaonan hasn’t yet used his full strength,” Hong Xuzi said.

“What?” Di Xi was startled and said, “Lin Xiaonan has hidden his strength?”

“Sure.” Hong Xuzi nodded, “It won’t be so easy to fight an expert of the Saint Realm. Qi Luosheng has just reached the Saint Realm, so the kid could cut off his hand. However, Lin Xiaonan has reached the Saint Realm for dozens of years and even created the saintly body. He is much stronger than Qi Luosheng.”

“Look, he’s using his full strength...”

Di Xi immediately looked toward the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was perfect with the help of Origin of the World. He could block the joint attack from Lin Xiaonan and Qi Luosheng. He did not seem to be weaker than them.

However, Lin Xiaonan’s strength abruptly burst out.

Lin Xiaonan appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Then he changed himself into a peerless beast. Each part of his body, such as his hands, fingers, finger tips, elbows, shoulders, and knees, was transformed into a weapon.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The continuous powerful attack lashed out at an amazing speed.

Astonished, Jian Wushuang immediately used his swordsmanship to block the attacks. Each of his strokes crashed into Lin Xiaonan’s body parts, but they could not split his body. Lin Xiaonan suddenly opened his mouth and let out a low howl. In the blink of an eye, a blast of sound waves rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

The sudden onslaught of the sound waves seriously injured Jian Wushuang. Blood spurted from his mouth. Like a cannonball being fired, his body was thrown backward. He fell heavily, causing the ground on the Heartless Island to be crushed. Jian Wushuang’s aura immediately faded away.

“Alas!”

“He is defeated!”

“Even if he’s peerless, he ultimately lost.”

The countless experts could not help but sigh on witnessing this scene.

Jian Wushuang, who seemed to have lost his battle strength, did not look panic-stricken. He had a meaningful smile on his face, because 10 minutes had passed.
