4176 Water Sorcerer Ruler

“I’ve embarrassed myself.”

Ruler Spear River landed on the ground, panting heavily, his forehead covered in sweat.

The surrounding Rulers who were watching the battle cast envious gazes at him. This person had taken the palm of the Ninth Kalpa King, which meant that he could follow the Ninth Kalpa King. In the future, he should be able to do whatever he wanted in the Tarot Ruins.

However, there was not much joy on spear river’s face, only lingering fear.

It was too difficult for him to receive the palm strike just now. It was an explosion that exhausted all the divine power in his body!

But even so, he could only barely offset the power of this palm.

One must know that this was just a casual palm strike from the Ninth Kalpa King. He was not serious at all.

The Ninth Kalpa King was too terrifying.

In the void, the Ninth Kalpa King lowered his head and looked at him with a hint of approval in his eyes. He said indifferently, “It’s not bad to be able to withstand this palm.”

…

Time passed slowly, and gradually, many people came to challenge the Ninth Kalpa King.

However, most of them did not manage to withstand the palm of the Ninth Kalpa King and had to leave in disappointment. Only a few of the more famous experts among the Ultimate Rulers were able to withstand the palm of the Ninth Kalpa King.

“Ran Gu, take good care of little Qing. Master will be back soon.” Water Sorcerer Ruler warned before taking a deep breath. With a determined look in his eyes, he strode toward the Ninth Kalpa King.

He knew that it was his turn!

“Be careful, master!”

Ran Gu and Qingxi shouted worriedly from behind.

When Water Sorcerer Ruler heard this, he stopped in his tracks. However, he did not turn back and continued walking toward the Ninth Kalpa King.

He knew that so many Ultimate Rulers, including some weaker peak Ultimate Rulers, could not withstand the palm of the Ninth Kalpa King. Although he was also at the level of a peak Ultimate Ruler, he was not very strong. It would be very difficult for him to withstand the palm of the Ninth Kalpa King.

But…

For the sake of his eldest disciple, he had to give it a try!

A moment later, he walked to the feet of the Ninth Kalpa King, cupped his hands, and said, “Ninth Kalpa King, I’m Water Sorcerer. Please enlighten me.”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s expression did not change. He nodded and said, “Come on.”

Boom!

With a loud explosion, the Ninth Kalpa King raised his palm and slammed it down at Water Sorcerer Ruler!

The surging godly power condensed and formed a giant palm that could cover the sky. Every palm print was clearly visible and filled with profound universe principles.

This palm then came crashing down on Water Sorcerer Ruler!

Water Sorcerer Ruler did not dare to relax in the slightest upon seeing this. He quickly formed seals with his hands and bellowed, “Water dragon, rise!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Bang!

In an instant, a powerful gust of wind exploded with him at the center. Water Sorcerer Ruler’s hair and beard all flew up in the air as his eyes widened in rage!

Roar!

A dragon’s roar was heard. then, a dark blue water dragon rushed out of his divine body and bit at the giant palm that looked like a dark cloud!

Pa.

Like glass shattering, the Water Dragon formed from the Water Sorcerer God’s divine power only lasted for ten seconds before shattering.

“He’s too weak,” The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head.

Water Sorcerer Ruler completely ignored them. He did not even spare them a glance as he used all his strength to shout, “Gather for this old man!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

In an instant, the thousands of water droplets formed by the collapse of the Water Dragon seemed to be pulled by something. They gathered from all directions at the same time, twisted and fused, and finally formed a huge, thick wave of water.

Immediately after, this wave of water once again pressed toward the Ninth Kalpa King’s giant palm!

Bang!

Accompanied by a loud noise, the water wave actually passed through the Ninth Kalpa King’s giant palm and then wrapped the giant palm in it. Like a millstone, it began to grind away the divine power on the giant palm.

“Oh?” When the Ninth Kalpa King saw this, he raised his head and looked at the Water Sorcerer Ruler for the first time. His eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

“His use of the principles of heaven and earth is rather intriguing,” he said with a faint smile.

At the outermost area of the crowd, Ran Gu and Qingxi were extremely excited when they saw this scene.

Even Jian Wushuang could not help but raise his eyebrows.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The water wave wrapped around the Ninth Kalpa King’s giant palm layer by layer, constantly crushing and erasing the divine power on the giant palm. This water wave was also rapidly annihilated at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Water Sorcerer Ruler stared at this sight, a voice roaring in his mind. Destroy! Destroy!

Time slowly passed, and after a short while, more than half of the Ninth Kalpa King’s giant palm’s power had been worn down, while only a thin layer remained of Water Sorcerer Ruler’s water wave.

Water Sorcerer Ruler’s expression was extremely grim. A thin layer of sweat had even appeared on his forehead due to his extreme nervousness.

Just as the Ninth Kalpa King’s huge palm was about to be completely obliterated by the Water Sorcerer Ruler’s water wave, the Ninth Kalpa King seemed to know the outcome. He retracted his gaze and said indifferently, “Your usage of the rules is not bad. It’s a pity that you’re still a little lacking in terms of your own strength.”

Water Sorcerer Ruler was taken aback. He did not understand what they were saying. “What…what?”

Before he could finish.

Bang!

The water wave, which was already as thin as a cicada’s wing, was actually annihilated and shattered before the Ninth Kalpa King’s huge palm that was about to be annihilated!

“No!”

Water Sorcerer Ruler’s face twisted, and a look of unwillingness flashed through his eyes.

However, the outcome was already decided.

“You may leave.”

The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head. From what he could see, the Water Sorcerer Ruler’s use of divine power was quite good, but it was only good. It would not make him look at it in a new light.

“This…!” Water Sorcerer Ruler felt as if all his energy had been sucked out of his body, and he fell into a daze.

Not being able to join the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp meant that he would not even have a place to stand in the Tarot Ruins, let alone avenge his innocent eldest disciple who had died tragically.

“Yes, thank you for your guidance, Ninth Kalpa King.” Water Sorcerer Ruler forced a smile on his face and cupped his hands at the Ninth Kalpa King. He then turned around and walked out of the crowd.

No one knew how heavy his steps were at this moment.

To him, if he missed this opportunity, he might never have the chance to avenge his disciple in this life.

The crowd gradually parted to form a path.

All of the Ultimate Rulers present were looking at Water Sorcerer Ruler with rather complicated gazes.

Even though he did not manage to withstand the palm strike of the Ninth Kalpa King in the end, anyone with a discerning eye could tell that the palm strike of the Ninth Kalpa King had already reached its limit. Perhaps, as long as the water wave of the Water Sorcerer Ruler could last for another three breaths, the outcome would be completely different.

Water Sorcerer Ruler had proven his power.

In this world, the strong were always respected.
