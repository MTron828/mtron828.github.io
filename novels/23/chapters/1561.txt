Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Mortal world?”

Hall Master Yuan thought for a while and said, “In Eternal Chaotic World, power is the most important thing. The moment a human is born, their main focus is to cultivate. No matter in which Eternal World, it isn’t easy to find an immortal world.”

“However, I do know of a mystery land. Although there are many cultivators, there’s also a place for commoners. The name of the mystery land is Qing Tian Mystery Land. It’s under the control of Green Feather Pavilion.”

“Green Feather Pavilion is within Star land. If you’d like to go to the mystery land, let me arrange it for you.”

“Sorry for the trouble,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

Then, Jian Wushuang called for Qiu Yue.

“Mister,” Qiu Yue appeared before Jian Wushuang and greeted.

In the past three thousand years, the attitudes of many disciples in Lineage of Star did change drastically.

However, Qiu Yue and the other maidservants still respected him as before.

“I want to head over to Green Feather Pavilion. Give me a lift,” Jian Wushuang said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although Green Feather Pavilion was within Star land, it was still quite a distance from Lineage of Star. To Jian Wushuang, who was only a commoner, it was too far. He naturally needed to count on Qiu Yue.

Qiu Yue naturally agreed instantly.

Very soon, the two of them departed.

Qiu Yue escorted Jian Wushuang and they arrived before the entrance of Green Feather Pavilion very soon.

“Please help us to inform them that the disciple of Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang is here to visit,” Qiu Yue looked at the disciple guarding Green Feather Pavilion and said.

“Disciple of Lineage of Star?” The few disciples who were guarding were shocked. One of them looked at Qiu Yue and asked, “Are you the disciple of Lineage of Star? Do you have the disciple token?”

“I’m not. The one behind me is,” Qiu Yue answered.

“Him? You’re just kidding, right?” The few disciples looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look and one even scoffed at the sight.

They could obviously tell that Jian Wushuang was a commoner without any fluctuation of divine power.

How could such a person be a disciple of Lineage of Star, which was highly respectable?

“This is the disciple token. You don’t have to ask so many questions, just go ahead and report,” Qiu Yue said in a low voice.

After the few guarding disciples determined that the token was genuine, they didn’t delay any further but went to report immediately.

Very soon, Master of Green Feather Pavilion and a few Real Gods came to greet him personally.

When they saw Jian Wushuang, Master of Green Feather Pavilion and the few Real Gods were shocked at the sight.

“I heard that the genius in Lineage of Star was schemed upon. Then, he lost all his power and became a disabled person. From the looks of it, it is true indeed,” Master of Green Feather Pavilion muttered to himself and invited Jian Wushuang in. After all, Hall Master Yuan had already gotten in touch with him regarding that.

In Green Feather Pavilion, Jian Wushuang walked behind Master of Green Feather Pavilion. He walked very slowly.

“This is the Jian Wushuang who was once in the third place on Universe God ranking list? How did he become like this?”

“It’s really him. I heard that he was poisoned. I also heard that he made a mistake as he was cultivating, which led to the loss of his power. In short, he is simply a disabled person. If someone takes action against him they could easily kill him.”

“From a top genius to a disabled person, things are unpredictable. Oh yeah, why did he come to Green Feather Pavilion?”

“I heard that he’s going to Qing Tian Mystery Land. There are commoners living there. This man, who was once a top genius, I’m afraid he might have to stay in Qing Tian Mystery Land forever. There might be a place that can contain him.”

On the way, Jian Wushuang ran into many disciples in Green Feather Pavilion. The conversation that the disciples were having then, Jian Wushuang couldn’t hear them at all but Qiu Yue could. There was rage churning in her eyes but she suppressed it.

Soon, they arrived before a space tunnel that had already activated.

“Jian Wushuang, this space tunnel leads to Qing Tian Mystery Land,” Master of Green Feather Pavilion smiled.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked Master of Green Feather Pavilion and turned around, “Qiu Yue, here will do. You can return now.”

“Mister,” Qiu Yue was shocked, “Although there are many commoners living in Qing Tian Mystery Land, there are also many cultivators gathered there. It is very dangerous. How can you wander around alone? I’d better follow you and protect you.”

“You don’t need to. I want to walk around alone,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

“But…” Qiu Yue wanted to say something.

“Don’t worry. Qing Tian Mystery Land is within Green Feather Pavilion’s control. We Green Feather Pavilion naturally have to protect Jian Wushuang,” Master of Green Feather Pavilion smiled.

Qiu Yue’s eyebrows were still tightly knitted.

“Go.”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and his figure slowly moved forward. Then, he took a leap into the space tunnel.

Then, Qiu Yue had no choice but to leave.

“Elder Ming Ba,” Master of Green Feather Pavilion spoke.

“Pavilion Master,” an elderly in a black robe walked forward.

“Although Jian Wushuang is a disabled person, he’s a disciple of Lineage of Star after all. The higher-ups in Lineage of Star seem to have yet to give him up. As he came to mystery land under Green Feather Pavilion’s control, we, Green Feather Pavilion, have to ensure his safety. Hence, you have to go to Qing Tian Mystery Land personally and follow him all the time. Don’t let him die.”

Master of Green Feather Pavilion’s voice was cold, “Of course, you only have to ensure that he doesn’t die. The rest, don’t bother.”

“I understand,” Elder Ming Ba nodded then immediately went into the space tunnel.

…

Qing Tian Mystery Land.

It was a mystery land of an extremely low level. The territory of the mystery land was extremely populated, but the number of cultivators was only ten percent. The other ninety percent was just commoners.

Different from Eternal Chaotic World, the moment the person fought, he would be listed as a cultivator. But there was only differences of strength.

Rolling hills at the depth of the mountain, in a forest.

“Pak! Pak!”

There was a young boy who looked only eight to nine years old, extremely honest and simple. He was hitting a wooden block before him with his bare shoulders.

The wooden block was extremely thick. It must have been left by adult cultivators. Although the young boy gave his all by swinging simple punches and slaps on the wood block, it didn’t move an inch.

But, the young boy was very persistent. He trained there for more than an hour and was drenched in his own sweat before stopped.

The young man panted in order to slow down his heartbeat and breathing while his eyes were twinkling with determination that a boy of his age didn’t usually have.

“For my mom and Xiao Qiu, I must become a warrior!”

“I must!”

The young boy clenched his fists.

Just then…
