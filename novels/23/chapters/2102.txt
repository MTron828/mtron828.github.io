Chapter 2103 The Strongest Soul Treasure

“This Soul Swallowing Pearl is not only good for Soul Attacks, but for defenses as well. The first Sky Swallowing Clan leader would not have been able to climb to the top ten amongst other Third Stage Great Emperors back in the First Era if not for this treasure. His Soul Attack was a great threat to us then!”

“This treasure was indeed known as the strongest Soul Treasure of the First Era, which made many experts red with envy,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback when he heard this.

The strongest Soul Treasure of the First Era?

The first leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan had used this treasure alone to make it to the top ten Third Stage Great Emperors?

This Pearl was so strong?

“Why do you ask this, Wushuang?” Emperor Bai asked.

“I brought the other three Top Clans to destroy the Sky Swallowing Clan, and found a mysterious pearl deep within their lair. This, then, should be the Soul Swallowing Pearl you speak of,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“The Pearl, you’ve found it?” Emperor Bai was astonished. “Jian Wushuang, try it out, see if you can cultivate this treasure.”

“Hmm, let me try, it will not be easy though,” Jian Wushuang replied.

He knew, if the Pearl were so easily controlled, it would not have been left there. Ba Su or some other expert would have long ago cultivated and utilised it.

Soon, he broke transmission with Emperor Bai.

At Thunderbolt, Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen were conversing.

“The Sword Emperor, he found the Soul Swallowing Pearl?” Ancestor Tian Chen’s eyes were glimmering.

As part of the Sanctuary Alliance’s top ranks, Ancestor Tian Chen knew quite a bit about it.

“That is correct,” Emperor Bai nodded.

“Excellent, the Pearl is the strongest Soul Treasure of the First Era. If a Great Emperor Expert fluent with Soul Attack had possession of it, he could utilise the treasure well, and perhaps with it we can reverse the situation to be in our favour!” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

The Soul Attack was known for its bizarreness.

It had another power – it ignored quantity.

To an expert of Soul Attacks, no matter the number of enemies, as long as their Soul level was not on par, one ruthless Soul Attack would sweep over and destroy troves of experts. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

For example, if over a hundred Almighties were to team up, even a normal Great Emperor would try to avoid that fight. But a Great Emperor fluent in Soul Attacks, with one sweep half of those Almighties would fall.

That was the terrifying feature of the Soul Attack.

But within the Eternal Chaotic World, experts who knew the Soul Attack were close to none. There were only a handful of Almighties, and not a single Great Emperor.

The Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze could perform Soul Attacks, but they were only useful in one-on-one combat.

With the appearance of this Pearl, if an expert from the Sanctuary Alliance fluent in Soul Attacks possessed it, even if he was not of Great Emperor level, the treasure would help him take his Soul Attacks to that level.

A Great Emperor who knew how to perform Soul Attacks would prove useful on the next battlefield.

“It is a good treasure, but as far as I know, mastering that Pearl is not an easy feat. The first leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan was a genius, but even he took eight hundred thousand years. Our Sanctuary Alliance is about to go into battle with the Three Emperors World, who will have that amount of time to cultivate? Jian Wushuang would know.” Emperor Bai sighed.

“Jian Wushuang is the genius of our Eternal Chaotic World, if even he cannot cultivate the Pearl in time, no one else could.”

Ancestor Tian Chen nodded subtly.

The treasure was good, but if one did not know how to master it, the Pearl was no more than a pretty toy.

No one from the Sky Swallowing Clan had utilised the Pearl since their first leader had died. They could only place it in the dungeon till Jian Wushuang discovered it.

…

Within the Sky Swallowing Clan’s dungeon.

Jian Wushuang looked at it bizarrely, that floating Pearl in front of him. Deep within, he knew he desired it.

With such a powerful treasure by his side, it would benefit him and the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

“Black Dragon Emperor, Leader An Quan, excuse me if you would, I want to try cultivating it,” Jian Wushuang said.

Both leaders nodded. They knew cultivating the Soul Swallowing Pearl was no easy feat, at least it was impossible for him.

But with Jian Wushuang, there was a slim chance he could.

Both leaders left.

Jian Wushuang then looked at King Chen Xing and King Zhan Cang. “King Chen Xing, follow the other leaders, and think of a way to find the other Sky Swallowers, along with Ba Su and those experts from Archelon Palace, Holocaust Sect … King Zhan Cang, stand guard outside the dungeon. I don’t wish for anyone to disturb me while I try cultivating it.”

“Understood,” they answered unanimously and left.

Only Jian Wushuang had remained within the entire dungeon. He walked towards the Pearl, and sat with his legs crossed.

“The Pearl was hidden there, but left uncultivated by any expert from the Sky Swallowing Clan. Obviously no one from their clan could do it, but could I?”

“Here goes nothing.”

With a tinge of expectation, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes as a strong Soul Power went straight for the Soul Swallowing Pearl.

As the Soul Power had fully encompassed the Pearl, a resonance could be immediately felt between them. Jian Wushuang finally understood why it was so hard to cultivate the Pearl.
