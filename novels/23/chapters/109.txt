Chapter 110: Sword Shadows and Blade Lights Collide

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This blade move…” Su Rou had almost had the Black Water Lotus when she suddenly noticed the dazzling cold blade. It seemed it could split the heaven and the earth, and it was slashing directly toward her.

This blade light made everyone shiver.

Su Rou’s expression paled immediately. At the same time, she judged that the blade was aiming for her arm. If she continued reaching for the Black Water Lotus, her entire arm would be chopped off.

Her armor the Black Water Lotus…Su Rou picked the former without hesitation.

She retracted her hand as she retreated rapidly.

Just as she drew back her hand, the gleaming cold blade light swept past where her arm had been.

Swoosh!

Chopping through the air, the blade light gradually faded away.

However, a huge crack, dozens of meters long and half a meter wide, emerged across the surface of Quiet Moon Lake. It looked as if the lake had been split in half.

Then, the water on both sides of the crack began flooding into the center.

Whoosh!

A nimble and unrestrained figure in cyan appeared abruptly and picked up the desired Black Water Lotus with a simple stretch of his hand. Only later did people look at his gently smiling face.

The whole Quiet Moon Lake turned still immediately.

The high-rise water curtain had descended, and now all the people around Quiet Moon Lake could see the figure in cyan holding the Black Water Lotus. Meanwhile, they also saw the huge crack that nearly tore the lake in two.

Everyone looked awed at that moment.

“Fourth Sister, are you all right?” Jian Wushuang came to Su Rou.

“I’m fine,” Su Rou shook her head, but her face stiffened.

“Is that him?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him, too. The unrestrained man in cyan was the top expert he had paid so much attention to…Xiao Mang.

Xiao Mang ranked 22nd on the Earthly Dragon List. Much higher than Gu Tao.

There was no doubt his strength was more extraordinary.

No one there, including Gu Tao, Ling Mubai, and the other experts on Earthly Dragon List, was confident enough to take on that glorious, yet extremely dreadful, blade move. Not without getting hurt anyway.

“Xiao Mang,” Gu Tao gazed at Xiao Mang, and said with a grim face, “You’ve never comprehended Essence of the Waterdrop, and someone like you would never help others fight for the Black Water Lotus. So the seven Black Water Lotus seeds should mean nothing to you.”

“You are right,” Xiao Mang lifted his head a bit and glanced at Gu Tao, saying with a smile, “the seven Black Lotus seeds do indeed mean nothing to me, so…”

As he spoke, Xiao Mang reached out and picked off the seven seeds in the center of the lotus, then released his grip in front of the astonished crowd.

The seven Black Lotus seeds dropped into the lake down below.

All the Gold Core warriors there were speechless.

Getting the Black Water Lotus using overpowering strength, then throwing away the most precious part, the lotus seeds, into the water?

Xiao Mang obviously had no interest in the seven seeds.

“The seeds are of no use to me, but I can benefit a lot from the Black Water Lotus. so I’ll be taking the lotus. Anyone got a problem?” Xiao Mang said, as he looking around.

Hearing what Xiao Mang said, everyone was elated. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“He only wants the lotus instead of the seeds?”

Gu Tao, Ling Mubai, and other experts on the Earthly Dragon List were surprised.

The seeds of the Black Water Lotus were helpful for comprehending Essence of the Waterdrop, but the flower itself could hardly be put to use. so the flower could not attract any of the Gold Core warriors there.

“Xiao Mang, you may leave now, since you have the Black Water Lotus,” Gu Tao said bluntly.

“Right, you can leave. We will not stop you,” said Ling Mubai and other experts on Earthly Dragon List.

Xiao Mang nodded, and turned around slowly under everyone’s gaze, but suddenly…

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures blocked his way. They were Jian Wushuang and Su Rou. Jian Wushuang stared at Xiao Mang and spoke to him, half smiling. However, his calm and cold words made the atmosphere tense up again.

“Sorry, I also have no interest in the seeds, but I have to take the Black Water Lotus.”

…

What Jian Wushuang said startled everyone around Quiet Moon Lake.

“What’s that boy trying to do?”

“Who is he? How dare he stop Xiao Mang?”

“Someone in the Initial Gold Core Realm dares to stop Xiao Mang? And he even said he wanted the Black Water Lotus too? Does he want to die?”

A majority of the Gold Core warriors there thought Jian Wushuang was insane.

While those who had fought with Jian Wushuang in the water curtain were wearing a strange expression.

“This boy…” Gu Tao frowned and took a look at Jian Wushuang, whom he had just encountered. Although Jian Wushuang was just in the Initial Gold Core Realm, his strength was way beyond his Realm.

Jian Wushuang was calm, no matter how people stared at him.

He didn’t know why Xiao Mang also wanted the Black Water Lotus, but he knew he had to win it back for Su Rou.

“Initial Gold Core Realm?”

Xiao Mang raised his head and took a look at Jian Wushuang without saying anything, but he suddenly unsheathed the saber on his back.

Swoosh!

Blade light burst out again, still cold and dazzling.

The overwhelming blade light slashed forward with irresistible force.

Everybody stared at the blade light in astonishment.

It was this blade flash that had nearly split the whole Quiet Moon Lake in half.

What a dreadful blade light!

Even Gu Tao, Ling Mubai, and other experts could not help feeling frightened the moment they saw it.

While the blade light slashed towards him, Jian Wushuang still looked calm as ever. But, in the next second, he drew his sword out from the sheath.

Supreme Gold Core, a power that was 100 times stronger than the Initial Gold Core Realm, exploded in an instant

Formless Sword Wave, tenth move!

Boom!

The air was instantly split wherever that terrifying sword shadow directly passed.

Right away, all the Gold Core warriors around felt like a majestic huge mountain was pressing down on them from the sword, and the heavy load made them unable to breathe.

The heaven and the earth was overshadowed by the majestic sword shadow. The sword shadow slashed forward at an incredible speed, splitting the water in the lake as it passed.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

In a blink of an eye, two enormous waves were lifted on both sides of the sword shadow.

The next moment, the mighty sword shadow crashed with the cold shining blade light.

It seemed like two different worlds collided.

The Heavens split and the earth cracked!
