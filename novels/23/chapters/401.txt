Chapter 402: Flaming Battlefield!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Of course, I’m willing to go.” Jian Wushuang nodded without hesitation.

Like the other commanders, he had been longing to go to Flaming Battlefield.

“The Iron Saber Territory is small and lacks real experts. Since I’ve been here, I haven’t had a chance to show my full strength or tried my best to fight. On the contrary, Flaming Battlefield will have many experts in Stage Three and at the Heaven-defying level of the Saint Realm.”

“When I get there, I can use my power to its full extent.”

“Besides, His Excellency was right. I can always protect myself using my trump cards. Even if I encounter an expert at Heaven-defying Level of the Saint Realm, I could still survive.”

“Since you are fine with the arrangement, don’t tarry. Go prepare yourselves. Tomorrow, you’ll go to Flaming Battlefield with Gu Man,” the Iron Saber Lord said to the five commanders.

“Yes.” The five nodded respectfully.

Soon after, the people assembled in the palace dispersed.

In the First Army.

“Swordsman, Lei Dao, and Shi Ling, congratulations to you all.”

“I really envy you guys.”

Yao Mei, Boozer, and Yun He were full of admiration.

“The Flaming Battlefield is extremely dangerous, please take care of yourselves when you get there,” General Qing sounded grave. “Swordsman can protect himself and Shi Ling is well-rounded so I’m not worried about them. But you, Lei Dao.”

General Qing looked at Lei Dao and continued, “His Excellency is right. You’re too impetuous. This will give you trouble if you don’t try to control it on Flaming Battlefield.”

“I see.” Lei Dao nodded heavily. The words of advice were seared in his mind.

“Ok, let’s stop talking and have a good drink,” General Qing said with a smile.

The commanders of the First Army didn’t need to be told twice to start celebrating.

Early the next morning, Jian Wushuang, Lei Dao, and Shi Ling appeared in the void above Huoyou Palace with Yan Mo and Bing Yue of the Second Army.

They greeted each other.

Before long, Gu Man arrived as well.

“Your Honors, if you’re ready, let’s go now,” Gu Man said humbly.

Gu Man worked for Marquis Piaoxue as a messenger, but he was inferior to the rest of them as he was only at Stage One of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. He had to show due respect to Jian Wushuang and the other four, who were in Stage Two.

“Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang answered.

Led by Gu Man, the five commanders made their way to the Flaming Battlefield.

During their journey, Gu Man said to them, “Your Honors, I have something to tell you about Flaming Battlefield.”

The five nodded and listened to him carefully.

“Flaming Battlefield is named after the Flaming Mountains, an unbroken line of ridges.”

“The whole battlefield is boundless and spans four million kilometers.”

The five were shocked at the information.

Four million kilometers?

Even one territory was smaller than an area of one million square kilometers.

Jian Wushuang’s hometown, Nanyang Continent, covered only hundreds of thousand square kilometers.

The Flaming Battlefield was just a battlefield but yet its area was so vast.

Even Stage Two experts like them would take a month or two at full speed to cover the entire area.

“Flaming Battlefield stretches over two Domains and is involved in the conflict between Marquis Piaoxue and Marquis Cangyue.”

“Both of them are top experts in Divine Land. They have been fighting for their own interests for a long time. Much of the fighting has taken place on Flaming Battlefield.”

Jian Wushuang nodded imperceptibly when he heard this.

In the vast Divine Land, Three Ancestors were supreme.

Second to them were Ten Sovereigns.

After the sovereigns were 72 Marquises.

Since Marquis Piaoxue and Marquis Cangyue were among the 72 Marquises, they had to be the top experts.

Jian Wushuang understood that the two marquises were the top experts among those in the Cloud Realm.

Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord were Domain Lords and were in the Cloud Realms as well,?but they could not hold a candle to the marquises.

Naturally, the battle between the two marquises was intense.

“Many experts from the two marquises’ camps have gathered on Flaming Battlefield. The fighting between the two camps has been endless. The weakest experts are in at least Stage Two of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.”

“Usually, each territory has about 10 experts fighting on Flaming Battlefield. When they perish, their Lords will dispatch other experts to take their places. Just like you guys, you’re going there to replace those from our territory who have fallen.”

“In addition to the experts from the two camps, there are also many experts from other Domains on the battlefield.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“As a result, the number of the experts fighting on Flaming Battlefield is staggering.”

Gu Man’s words stunned the five commanders.

As there were hundreds of territories in each domain and 10 experts from each territory,?the total number of the experts on the battlefield could be as high as ten thousand!

Everyone was shaken by the thought of so many experts at Stage Two fighting one another.

“It’s indeed a battlefield of experts,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“By the way, you mentioned opportunities in Flaming Battlefield. What exactly are those opportunities? It can’t be fighting all the time, right?” Jian Wushuang asked Gu Man, frowning.

If the opportunities referred only to killing one’s opponents and challenging one’s own abilities, there would not have been so many experts drawn to the battlefield.

“It’s true that there are many opportunities on Flaming Battlefield, including many big ones. The opportunities one has access to depends on his achievements in battle,” Gu Man answered.

“Battle achievement?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“One can get battle achievements by killing his opponents or accomplishing certain tasks.” Gu Man explained.
