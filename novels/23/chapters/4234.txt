4235 Snake slaying (Part Six)

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, an extremely mysterious force descended on the scene!

The area within 1000 feet of Jian Wushuang suddenly turned into a pitch-black domain.

The original universe had a strong suppressive power. As long as Jian Wushuang was within the domain of the original universe, his power would increase by a large margin while his opponent’s power would be greatly weakened!

Immediately, Jian Wushuang looked up and saw Heavenly Snake Playboy standing not far to his right. He quickly moved to the side.

“I’ve found you.”

Jian Wushuang sneered, stepped with his right foot, and rushed toward Heavenly Snake Playboy!

Whoosh!

“Split open the sky!”

A half-moon-shaped blood-red sword light struck out instantly and landed on Heavenly Snake Playboy.

Wuwuwuwuwu!

Heavenly Snake Playboy did not expect that Jian Wushuang would be able to capture his position. The sword directly cut his shoulder, leaving a deep cut.

“Eh? You can see me now?”

The cold smile on Heavenly Snake Playboy’s face disappeared, and he frowned.

“Heavenly Snake, go to hell!”

A cold voice was heard and Jian Wushuang charged again with his sword!

Clang!

A huge sword light instantly locked onto him, containing rich universe laws, and slashed at him ruthlessly!

Looking at the huge sword light, Heavenly Snake Playboy’s mouth pulled up into a strange smile again. He sighed and said, “The prey is starting to resist.”

A trident appeared in Heavenly Snake Playboy’s hand.

Heavenly Snake Playboy turned his right hand and also slashed out a halberd light containing rich universe principles toward Jian Wushuang!

Bang!

The trident radiance and the sword radiance collided. At the point of contact, a huge circular shock wave exploded and spread out in all directions.

Jian Wushuang and Heavenly Snake Playboy quickly exchanged thousands of moves!

With the help of the original universe, Jian Wushuang and Heavenly Snake Playboy’s speed finally reached the same level!

Jian Wushuang’s divine power was far stronger than Heavenly Snake Playboy’s!

The situation was reversed in an instant!

“Disgusting little bug.”

Jian Wushuang sneered in a low voice. The Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand continuously slashed out thousands of sharp sword Qi, which bombarded Heavenly Snake Playboy like bombs!

“Secret skill, sun devouring!!”

Facing the thousands of sharp sword Qi, Heavenly Snake Playboy’s face turned cold. He opened his mouth and bit at the thousands of sword Qi!

Boom!

As Heavenly Snake Playboy opened his mouth, a huge phantom of a snake appeared behind him!

The phantom of the giant snake opened its mouth and bared its fangs. With a fierce bite, it swallowed all the sword Qi.

Then, the giant snake Phantom opened its mouth again and bit Jian Wushuang!

“Sundering stars!”

Jian Wushuang sneered and the Wuqi Divine Sword immediately turned into a silver sword rainbow and slashed at the giant snake phantom!

Bang!

With an explosive sound, the giant snake phantom collapsed.

Jian Wushuang followed him with a leap. He stretched out his five fingers and grabbed Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head.

“Now, who is the prey?”

Jian Wushuang sneered and poured all the divine power that was twelve thousand times more than his divine body into his right hand. He grabbed Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head and pressed it to the ground.

Bang!

A huge pit appeared in the ground.

Jian Wushuang raised his hand, grabbed Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head, and pushed him toward a wall!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Jian Wushuang grabbed Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head and pushed him forward, breaking hundreds of walls.

The sharp sword essence wrapped around Jian Wushuang’s fingers and exploded on Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head.

“Poor little bug.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and threw Ruler Heavenly Snake into a small lake in the Eighth City with his right hand.

Countless people were dumbfounded.

No one had expected that the situation would be reversed so quickly. It was so fast that before they could react, Heavenly Snake Playboy had been crushed by Jian Wushuang.

The domain formed by the original universe gradually dissipated.

Jian Wushuang held the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand and walked toward the lake step by step.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, the water in the small lake was overturned, and turbulent waves rose up. A huge black python suddenly swept out of the small lake and opened its mouth to roar.

“Blood Sword, I’ve decided. Not only will I crush your divine body inch by inch, but I’ll also slaughter your entire clan and kill all the people close to you in this world!”

The giant python stared at Jian Wushuang with an extremely cold gaze and spoke in the human language.

The next moment!

Heavenly Snake Playboy, who had transformed into his original body, suddenly rushed out of the lake and rushed toward Jian Wushuang!

Pa pa pa pa!

A sound barrier-breaking explosion burst out beside his huge snake!

His speed was more than ten times faster now that he had returned to his original form!

Jian Wushuang’s vision blurred for a moment and he felt an extremely disgusting stench coming at him.

It opened its huge mouth and bit him ruthlessly, swallowing him!

“Not good! The Blood Sword is going to be swallowed by Heavenly Snake Playboy!”

“Legend has it that the stomach of the Heavenly Snake tribe is a small world of its own. Even the stars and the galaxy will be rapidly corroded and digested after being swallowed by the Heavenly Snake tribe!”

“If the Blood Sword is swallowed by Heavenly Snake Playboy, there’s no possibility of him surviving!”

“The two of them are too strong! This is the first time I’ve seen the true form of the Heavenly Snake tribe!”

In the distance, countless Rulers of the Eighth City, who were watching the battle, had their eyes flashing wildly.

As for Ruler Hao Jin and Holy Maiden Jiuxi, they clenched their fists tightly and did not even dare to breathe loudly as they watched this scene.

The snake’s mouth reeked of blood. Jian Wushuang raised his Wuqi Divine Sword and blocked the snake’s mouth that was closing.

Waves of cold Yin Qi came from deep inside Heavenly Snake Playboy’s body. Jian Wushuang knew that no matter how strong his divine body was, he would not be able to survive once Heavenly Snake Playboy swallowed him.

Roar!

Heavenly Snake Playboy roared madly. Jian Wushuang was in his mouth, but he could not bite the Wuqi Divine Sword that was supporting his upper jaw.

“Blood Sword, let’s see how long you can last.” Heavenly Snake Playboy’s cold voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

And then, drops of venom, enough to kill an Ultimate Ruler, flowed through his fangs and onto the Wuqi Divine Sword. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Immediately, the Wuqi Divine Sword, which was dripping with venom, let out a sizzling sound as it was burned.

Black spots the size of fingernails appeared on the Wuqi Divine Sword where the poison had dripped, and black poisonous smoke rose.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. He was afraid that even the Wuqi Divine Sword, which had reached the limit of a principles cardinal treasure, would not be able to last long under the poison.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang’s expression became calm again. He said word by word, “Innate divine ability, life intimidation!”

“Slash…star!”

Boom!

In an instant, countless forces surged around Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang did not hold back any of his trump cards. Except for the Tarot Divine Sword and ‘eternal night’, he used all of his strength!

“Today, I, Blood Sword, will show the world what I’m capable of!”
