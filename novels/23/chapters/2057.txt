2058 Anger!!!

In the void above, Emperor Bai’s gaze was cold as he overlooked the huge estate.

“I intentionally made Zi Xu leave earlier. Hence, besides his maidservants, his follower should also be in his estate.”

“The follower is extremely important to Zi Xu. She knows a lot about Zi Xu’s affairs. The purpose of our visit is to look for her!”

Emperor Bai said and he waved. There was a boundless divine power that instantly covered the entire estate and cut off the spacetime between the estate and the outside world.

Jian Wushuang’s expression grew solemn.

He also knew that it was common for a powerful expert to have a follower.

For example, Great Emperor Purple Moon had a follower, Qian Mingzi. He had once lent a helping hand to Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s head in.”

Emperor Bai commanded and the four of them immediately plunged into the estate.

In the huge estate that looked like a paradise, there was a boat drifting about on the river.

On the boat, there was a beautiful lady in a purple robe.

“I wonder why Emperor Bai suddenly told Master to go over in a hurry,” the beautiful lady in a purple robe muttered.

Great Emperor Zi Xu was originally on the boat too. However, he had suddenly received Emperor Bai’s message and left.

Just then…

“Huh?” The lady in a purple robe suddenly lifted her head to look at the surrounding void.

She could sense that the spacetime around the estate was completely sealed off.

“Who is it?” The lady in a purple robe shouted.

Vroom!

The four figures appeared in front of the boat and the four pairs of eyes looked at the beautiful lady in a purple robe.

“This is… Emperor Bai?”

The beautiful lady in a purple robe’s face changed, “Didn’t Emperor Bai ask Master to go over? Why is he suddenly here and he has purposely sealed off the surrounding spacetime? Could it be…”

The beautiful lady in a purple robe thought of a possibility and she was terrified at heart. But she remained composed, “Greetings Emperor Bai. Greetings misters. I wonder how can I help all of you?”

“I’d like to ask you something about Zi Xu,” Emperor Bai said frankly.

“Mister Emperor Bai, you must be kidding. Regarding things about my master, you should ask my master directly. I believe my master would definitely answer every question of yours,” the beautiful lady in a purple robe answered with a smile.

“You’re not willing to answer? Humph, just as expected,” Emperor Bai smiled coldly. Then, he took out a crimson pearl.

The crimson pearl gave out a mysterious aura. The mysterious aura was soul power.

“Go.”

With Emperor Bai’s will, the soul power in the crimson pearl instantly burst out.

“Sh*t.”

The beautiful lady in a purple robe’s face changed and she wanted to resist. However, her power stood no chance to struggle before Emperor Bai. She could only watch as the soul power invaded her head. Her body quivered and there was a flash of struggle in her eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But she instantly calmed down again.

“Mister Emperor Bai, what is this?” Jian Wushuang looked over suspiciously.

“This is a unique treasure I got from an ancient battlefield long ago. It contains soul power that could straight away control someone for a short time for the person to obey your instructions. Of course, the treasure is only useful to experts below Great Emperor level. Plus, this person is merely Zi Xu’s follower and she wasn’t soul controlled by Zi Xu. Otherwise, the treasure wouldn’t be effective on her,” Emperor Bai smiled. Then, his gaze redirected to the beautiful lady in a purple robe again.

“Tell me. I want to know everything about Zi Xu.”

“Yes,” the beautiful lady in a purple robe nodded blankly. Then, she started telling him the ins and outs of the story.

The beautiful lady in a purple robe who was controlled by Emperor Bai naturally handed over everything she knew on a silver platter.

Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Ancestor Tian Chen listened carefully.

In the beginning, they were calm and composed. However, as the story developed, the four of them looked to be in distress.

In the end, the four of their faces grew grave.

Great Emperor Zi Xu was really the spy that Acheron Palace had placed within Sanctuary Alliance. It was verified by the beautiful lady in a purple robe’s speech.

Over the years, Great Emperor Zi Xu had also killed some top geniuses secretly using various methods in Eternal Chaotic World.

Actually, most of the assassination was carried out by Acheron Palace. However, there were times when it was inconvenient for Acheron Palace to take action due to some unique reasons. Then, Great Emperor Zi Xu would take care of it on its behalf.

During the years when he was a higher-up in Sanctuary Alliance, the number of assassinated top geniuses was far beyond what Ancestor Tian Chen and Emperor Bai had found.

However, the fact that Great Emperor Zi Xu was a spy and the issue geniuses that Great Emperor Zi Xu had assassinated over the years was not what pissed the four of them off.

They were truly shocked and angry that the beautiful lady in a purple robe had brought up another force.

Vientiane Tower!!!

The number-one chamber of commerce that was widely acknowledged in Eternal Chaotic World. No matter if it was selling information, treasure, resources or even offering assassination services, Vientiane Tower was known to be number one. And they were greatly related to Great Emperor Zi Xu.

The reason why Great Emperor Zi Xu could kill so many top experts secretly without anyone in Eternal Chaotic World knowing and the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance never suspecting him was that Vientiane Tower was involved to remove all traces he left behind.

There were even times when Great Emperor Zi Xu could have removed the geniuses successfully because Vientiane Tower catalyzed the process.

Great Emperor Zi Xu and Vientiane Tower looked like they had no relations but they were closely knitted.

What did it mean?

It meant that Vientiane Tower was also a force that Acheron Palace and Holocaust Sect had placed in Eternal Chaotic World!

“Vientiane Tower!!” Emperor Bai bellowed and his voice reverberated through the surrounding universe.

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Ancestor Tian Chen were angry too.

Vientiane Tower as the number one chamber of commerce, just how high was their position in Eternal Chaotic World? How powerful were they?

If the widely acknowledged number-one force in Sanctuary Alliance was Lineage of Star, the strongest force that didn’t belong to Sanctuary Alliance in the human region over the years was no doubt Vientiane?Tower.

Vientiane Tower possessed power and a foundation that was sufficient for Divine King Island, Soaring Heaven King Palace and other top forces to look up to it.

How could such a great force be on the enemy’s side?

“No wonder Vientiane Tower isn’t willing to join Sanctuary Alliance. On the surface, they say that they don’t want to get involved in the affairs. In actual fact, the information that they are trading stirs up great massacres and fights within Eternal Chaotic World!”

“The assassin department has assassinated many experts and geniuses of Eternal Chaotic World over the years.”

“Although they’re not fighting, every single movement of theirs will stir up a bloody massacre in Eternal Chaotic World!”

Ancestor Tian Chen’s voice was cold and it contained boundless murderous intention.
