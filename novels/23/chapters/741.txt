“Elder Yi.”

Jian Wushuang bowed to the elder in front of the black pavilion.

Elder Yi looked at the boy with a faint smile while asking, “Are you ready to fight the outsiders?”

“Yes, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Although they don’t have much strength, they have superb skills. You should go to fight them, but you have to be careful because the outsiders are interested in our Essence Blood, so it will be an all-out fight if you do encounter them.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“As a Militant Warrior, you have experienced such fights many times before, so I won’t need to remind you more about it. Here’s something for you.” Elder Yi waved his hand and threw a wilted yellow leaf to the boy.

Jian Wushuang received it and immediately felt the terrifying power contained within it.

“Elder Yi, what is it?” Jian Wushuang asked with a confused look.

“This leaf can save your life. Your Imperial Bloodline is important to us, so I don’t dare to risk your life.” Elder Yi responded with a faint smile. “This leaf contains my finger power. If you’re in danger, just tear it.”

“Thank you, Elder Yi.” Jian Wushuang expressed his appreciation with a flicker of delight in his heart.

It was clear to him that Elder Yi was really a Three-star Ancient God, even superior to a Human Dao Master, so the power of his finger would be a brilliant weapon. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I’ve ordered Gu Heng to go with you. If you have any problem, just ask him.” Elder Yi waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then left.

Gu Heng had been waiting outside of the Ancient God Palace.

Seeing Jian Wushuang approaching, Gu Heng stepped forward and said with a smile, “Jian Wushuang, we’ll work together this time.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and asked, “Gu Heng, have you fought an outsider?”

“Of course I have,” Gu Heng replied. “The outsiders invade our homeland every 100 years, so our clan arranges some clansmen to fight them.

“Aside from ordinary Two-star Ancient Gods from the 10 big tribes, our clan sometimes dispatches one or two clansmen from the Ancient God Palace.

“I have fought the outsiders three times, so this is my fourth crusade.”

“Oh really?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Right, you haven’t brawled with the outsides, have you? Their strength is poor, but they have amazing skills.” Gu Heng started to talk about the outsiders.

Jian Wushuang listened attentively but he felt inwardly aggrieved.

Because after all, he also came from the outside world and could be regarded as an outsider.

Therefore, he had a better understanding of the skills of the human experts than Gu Heng did.

Shortly after, they arrived at the great mountains, which stretched out for thousands of miles.

They were called the Tianqi Mountains. Due to their years of experience, the clansmen from the Ancient God Clan knew that the outsiders would appear at any corner of the mountains, so they waited there.

Hundreds of Two-star Ancient Gods were standing close by in the void.

They all came from the 10 tribes. Aside from a few powerful ones, most of them were mediocre.

Gu Xiu, who had saved Jian Wushuang once, was considered the strongest among the group of Two-star Ancient Gods.

At this point, they gathered in twos and threes and were chatting with each other.

“I heard that the Ancient God Palace will send someone here.”

“As we all know, only Gold-armored Ancient Gods or real supreme clansmen are qualified to enter the Ancient God Palace, so every one of them is far superior to us.”

“I wonder which one will come here.”

The Two-star Ancient Gods were looking forward to it.

The Ancient God Clan paid more attention to strength and bloodline. Many clansmen dreamed of having access to the Ancient God Palace.

At this point, two figures glided over from afar.

“Finally!”

“Two masters are coming?”

The Two-star Ancient Gods widened their eyes.

Those two figures quickly appeared in front of them.

The Two-star Ancient Gods were a bit surprised when they saw the bald man.

“Gu Heng, Master Gu Heng!”

“Wow, Master Gu Heng came here?”

“Gu Heng will personally fight the outsiders. Do they have any chance to survive?”

The Two-star Ancient Gods obviously knew about Gu Heng’s strength, so they were shocked.

However, the moment they noticed the young man beside Gu Heng, they all wore odd expressions on their faces.

“One-star? A One-star Ancient God?”

“Are you kidding me?”

“He definitely came to the wrong place. A One-star Ancient God should go to the outer layer and fight with those so-called Divine Realm experts.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang gave them a wry smile, as he had foreseen that they would have such a reaction.

After all, he was only a One-star Ancient God. Even though he came from the Ancient God Palace, his level did not convince them.

“Jian Wushuang, it seems that you’ll have to prove yourself.” Gu Heng teased him.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders with resignation.

“OK, listen up, this is Jian Wushuang. Although he is just a One-star Ancient God, his strength is far superior to most of ours.” Gu Heng introduced him in a resonant voice.

“As for this fight with the outsiders, we will be your commanders, so you have to follow our orders over the next 10 days, understand?”

“Understood,” chorused the Two-star Ancient Gods.

Although they responded in a loud voice, Jian Wushuang could tell that they still doubted his strength from their unnatural expressions.
