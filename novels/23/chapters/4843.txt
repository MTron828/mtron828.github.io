4847 I’ll Give You an Immortal Root

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile when he saw him trying to hold it in. “Do you have any questions for me?”

“Can I ask? You won’t get angry?”

“Of course you can. I won’t get angry.”

Li Dachun could not hold back anymore after getting the confirmation. He asked directly, “Are you an Immortal? Are you as powerful as those old Daoist priests at Qingting Mountain?”

Jian Wushuang was a little surprised and then he did not know whether to laugh or cry. “I guess so, but we’re all ordinary Immortals.”

“I knew you were Immortals,” Li Dachun said excitedly after getting the confirmation. “We were fishing in the river at that time, and the sky turned dark in an instant, accompanied by lightning and thunder. It could scare people to death. We hid in the boat and didn’t dare to show our faces.”

“We didn’t dare to come out until the sky recovered. Then we saw you guys floating in the water. You guys were all emitting Immortal Qi…”

Li Dachun spoke with fervor and assurance, but when he saw that Jian Wushuang had not spoken, he immediately stuttered nervously, “Er, did I say too much…. I’m sorry, I only said this because I don’t think you’re a bad person.”

“It’s fine. I haven’t spoken to anyone in a long time. It feels pretty good,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Li Dachun quickly nodded and said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to drive you away. I was worried that you were bad guys and would do us harm, but it seems that you’re all good people.”

He looked at Li Dachun and said with a smile, “Why do you think I look like a good person again?”

“Because you don’t put on any airs at all. You’re even more peaceful than the Immortals on our Qingting Mountain who have achieved Dao. You must be a good person,” Li Dachun scratched his head and said.

His view was very simple. He simply judged that Jian Wushuang and the others were good people.

Jian Wushuang smiled but did not say anything. From what he felt, the Yan power in this realm was very sparse. It was probably impossible to provide for an Ancestor-level cultivator.

Therefore, the Immortals and Daoist priests of Qingting Mountain that Li Dachun had mentioned were probably not even top cultivators, but just ordinary cultivators. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The villagers of our village have lived on the bank of the Wei River for generations. They all eat water and rely on the heavens for their harvest.”

“Although we don’t have any great abilities, we can still fill your stomachs. If you still need a place to stay for the time being, you can continue to stay with us.”

While they were talking, Li Dachun knocked on the door of the first villager with Jian Wushuang.

Zhao Ting had just woken up. When she saw that it was Jian Wushuang, she heaved a sigh of relief.

After a brief conversation, Jian Wushuang took Zhao Ting to the next place.

Wei Liujia and Xi Qingchi did not suffer too much of an impact at the last moment, so they naturally recovered the fastest.

Di Qing, on the other hand, had been in a deep sleep.

In line with Jian Wushuang’s thoughts, the power of Changfu’s last thought had indeed taken Di Qing’s life, which was why he had been unable to wake up.

Since Di Qing could not wake up, their departure time had to be delayed, and they had to stay in the village for a while.

In order not to trouble Li Dachun and the other villagers, Jian Wushuang directly opened up a cave not far from the village for them to rest in.

A few months passed by in a flash.

During this period, Li Dachun and the other villagers delivered fish soup and other fish products on time to ensure that the Immortals would not go hungry, even though they did not know that the Immortals no longer needed food.

The Yan power in the Heavenly Region was so sparse that they could not even absorb it. Zhao Ting and the others naturally were not interested in it. They just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

However, Di Qing showed no signs of waking up, except for his breath becoming more stable.

Time continued to fly by. After Jian Wushuang said that they did not need food, the villagers rarely came to deliver food.

However, Li Dachun’s sister, Li Shichun, was the only one who would visit him every three to four days without feeling tired.

Outside the cave, Jian Wushuang condensed a finger-sized bird with his Yan power and gave it to Li Shichun.

“You’re so pretty. Your acting is much better than the wood my brother made,” the little girl held the flying bird and said with a smile.

“Can you transform an animal for me every day in the future?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the vast Wei River in the distance and said, “I’m afraid I can’t. I’ll have to leave soon.”

“So soon? Can’t you stay?”

“I can’t. I still have a lot of things to do.”

Li Shichun pouted. “Can you teach me then? I’ll look for you and transform for you after I’ve learned it.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head when he heard Li Shichun’s innocent words. He was about to explain patiently when he noticed a slight reaction from Yan power between Li Shichun’s eyebrows.

He reached out his finger and pressed it between her eyebrows.

After a brief investigation, Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Since you want to learn so much, I’ll teach you.”

With that, a wisp of pure Yan power left his palm and quickly entered Li Shichun’s forehead.

Nothing had changed, but everything had changed.

In this Heavenly Region where Yan power was scarce, it would be hard to become a top cultivator. However, in this realm, there was a talented genius who was born with Immortal talent and was sensitive to Yan power.

And such a genius was Li Shichun, who was sitting next to Jian Wushuang.

Before she realized it, Jian Wushuang had secretly activated her Immortal talent and given her an Immortal root.

Even though everything he had done was useless in the face of this Heavenly Region, it was enough to for her to do magic tricks.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, Li Shichun only wanted to have the ability to conjure a flying bird trick. He had given it to her, and that was all.

The sun and the moon passed by, and Di Qing only woke up after nearly another year.

His Immortal body was strong, but his life force was weak. It was obvious that he had not fully recovered, but it was enough.

It was time for them to leave.

“You really want to leave? Don’t you want to stay for a few more days?” Li Dachun asked.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and laughed, “No, I’ve stayed here for several years. It’s time to leave.”

“In addition, you and your descendants can hide in the Heavenly Abode I left behind if you encounter a war or a natural disaster. You won’t be discovered by the outside world.”

After giving his instructions, he patted Li Shichun’s head. “Remember to practice hard. I might come back to check on you in the future.”

Li Shichun nodded heavily. “Yes, don’t worry. I won’t let you down.”

Apart from Li Shichun, everyone present knew that these mysterious Immortals would never come here again.
