Chapter 2950: Three Sages of the Shadow

——

“As far as I know, the only True Saint in this territory is someone who understands the laws of the Earth. If he knew that there was an Earth God Fruit here, he would definitely rush over like crazy. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know about this place at all.” The cold old man said with a cold smile.

“Hmph, the value of this Earth God Fruit is shocking. If we had a good channel, we could definitely sell it for an astronomical price. The True Saint in our surrounding territory is only a first-level True Saint. How could he have the qualifications to possess such a good treasure?” Another black-haired skinny man said in a low voice.

“No matter what, we only need to wait here for a month. After a month, when the Earth God Fruit ripens, we will think of a way to sell it. Then, we will be rich.” The last fat bald youth said with a strange smile.

The three of them chatted leisurely.

At this moment…

“Oh?”

The three’s expressions suddenly changed.

The restriction that covered the entire Dark Shout Realm was set up by the three of them together.

When this restriction was torn apart, the three of them simultaneously sensed it.

“Someone tore apart the restriction and directly barged in,” the gloomy and cold old man said in a deep voice.

“The restriction set up by the three of us might cover a large area, but no one below the undying sage should be able to break it. Now that it’s been torn open, the Immortal Saint must have taken action,” the black-haired skinny man said in a cold voice, “third brother, take a careful look.”

“Okay.” The chubby bald youth nodded. Then, he closed his eyes and began to investigate.

The restrictions of the three of them were formed with the bald youth as the core. The bald youth was able to merge into the restrictions and clearly see the area that had been torn apart.

“I saw it. There are two people who have torn apart the restrictions. If nothing unexpected happens, one of them should be the Xue Dong King,” the bald youth said.

“Xue Dong King? It’s him?” The cold old man and the black-haired skinny man frowned.

Xue Dong King had a strange temper and was extremely powerful. Not only was he famous in the Inkstone Realm, but he was also quite famous in the surrounding realms.

This was especially true after Xue Dong King had broken through to become an Immortal Saint. His strength had soared and his name had naturally become even more famous.

Although the three of them had stayed in the Dark Shout Realm all year round to wait, they still maintained contact with the outside world. Naturally, they had heard of this Xue Dong King.

“We don’t have any entanglements with this Xue Dong King. What is he doing here? Moreover, it has to be at this time?” The black-haired skinny man said in a deep voice.

“Third brother, you just said that there were two people who came together. where is the other one?” The cold-looking Elder asked.

“There is another person wearing a gray robe and a gray mask on his face. From the looks of it, he should also be a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” the bald youth said.

“Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The cold Elder was immediately shocked.

“However, the aura emitted by this person from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is only at the Divine Master level. There’s no need to pay any attention to him,” the bald youth said.

“Divine Master?” The cold Elder looked over in surprise. “Third brother, look carefully. is that person really just a Divine Master?”

“Of course, I saw him very clearly. Moreover, with my perceptive ability, even an ordinary first-level True Saint wouldn’t be able to conceal his aura in front of me. It’s impossible for him to conceal his aura,” the bald youth said with certainty.

“If that’s the case, then it’s still fine.” The cold old man and the black-haired skinny man both let out a sigh of relief.

If the person who had arrived was the Xue Dong King, an Immortal Saint whose strength was unknown in the outside world, then they would definitely be nervous, worried that the Xue Dong King duo would attack them.

However, now that they knew that the person who had come with the Xue Dong King was only a Divine Master, there was nothing to worry about.

Although Xue Dong King’s strength was extraordinary and he was extremely strong among the Peak False Saints, very close to the True Saints, with the combined strength of the three of them, they could still contend against him. If they used a few more tricks… they were even confident that they could beat Xue Dong King back.

Because of this, they were not worried about Xue Dong King at all. As for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance expert who came with Xue Dong King, he was just a mere Divine Master. Even if he was a Peak Invincible Divine Master, they would not care too much about him.

Such a lineup would only make them treat him seriously, but it would not make them choose to run for their lives.

“No matter what, at this juncture, Xue Dong King and Xue Dong King came uninvited. We still have to be careful. Third brother, use your restriction to hide the Earth God Fruit. Don’t let them see any clues when you go,” said the cold old man.

“Don’t worry. With me here, even if he uses his soul power, he won’t be able to find anything,” the bald youth said with a smile.

“That’s good. Let’s go and welcome him,” the cold Elder said.

Immediately, the three of them went to the sky above the swamp and waited there quietly.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King tore the restriction and entered the dark shout domain. They flew toward the center and soon arrived above the swamp.

“Sure enough, the three Shadow Saints knew we were coming and were already waiting there.” Jian Wushuang looked ahead and could clearly see the three figures standing in the void.

“Humph, these three guys are really bold. They knew we were coming and were probably looking for trouble, but they didn’t run away. They are courting death.” Xue Dong King sneered.

“They are courting death.” Jian Wushuang also sneered.

In the blink of an eye, the two people had already appeared in front of the third Saint.

The third Saint stood proudly in the void. When he saw Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King, he was not nervous or afraid at all.

“Xue Dong King, and this friend from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, May I know why you have come to my secret realm?” The leader of the third Saint Shadow, the cold Elder, asked indifferently.

“Our purpose is very simple. We only have one purpose. That is to send you three brothers to the road of the underworld and make a trip there,” Xue Dong King said directly.

“Send us to the road of the underworld?”

The three Shadow Saints’ faces immediately turned cold.

“Xue Dong King, you are too arrogant. Not long ago, you were just a Divine Master. Even if you have some strength, you are just an ant in front of us three brothers. Now, although you have reached the Immortal Saint realm and your battle strength is much stronger than before, you can’t take advantage of us alone, can you?” The cold Elder said in a low voice.

“Haha, that may not be the case.” The corners of Xue Dong King’s mouth curled up slightly. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and said softly, “Brother Tianhou, I’ll test the strength of the three Shadow Saints first. Wait until it’s about time for you to watch, then attack.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.
