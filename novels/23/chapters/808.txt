Chapter 809: Blood Mountain Sword’s Power

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“No, how could this be?”

“I, Lei Xin, I’m an expert at the peak of Step Five of the Eternal Realm and he’s just a Divine Realm expert, but how come I can’t beat him?”

Lei Xin wiped the blood from his mouth and glared in disbelief at Jian Wushuang in the distance.

By this time, Jian Wushuang had calmed the blood in his body and appeared in front of Lei Xin again.

“Haha, Lei Xin, you’re not all that powerful, are you?” Jian Wushuang gave him a wry smile.

“Humph, I admit that you are much stronger than I thought. I can’t kill you alone. Nevertheless, don’t get cocky. There are countless experts in this world, and even on Cercis Island, many experts are stronger than you and can kill you easily. With my identity, I can easily pay a price and ask some experts to kill you,” Lei Xin threatened in a freezing voice.

“Oh, really?” Jian Wushuang gave a noncommittal tilt of his mouth, but then he shook his head, and said, “Do you think I will give you this chance to do that?”

“What?” Lei Xin’s face instantly darkened, and he then noticed that a man was coming at tremendous speed from the direction of Cercis Island behind him.

Soon, the man arrived in front of him.

“Your doppelganger?”

The man looked exactly like Jian Wushuang.

He was certain that Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Doppelganger Secret Skill, and that the man he had just fought against was too powerful to be his doppelganger.

“Oh, so you think you can keep me by joining forces with your doppelganger?” Lei Xin said scornfully.

It was a well-known fact of Doppelganger Secret Skill, that the doppelganger was much less powerful than the Original Body.

Therefore, Lei Xin did not feel the slightest fear when he saw Jian Wushuang’s “doppelganger”.

“Haha, you’re not strong enough for my Original Body to join forces with my doppelganger,” Jian Wushuang said with a frigid smile. With that, his Slaughter Body came to him quickly, and then his two Original Bodies became one again.

The two Original Bodies were born because of the Heavenly Creation Skill he had cultivated.

The two Original Bodies were of equal strength, and their battle strength would not be greatly affected when they were united as one. The only difference was that Jian Wushuang fought against Lei Xin with the Emperor Sword just now.

Meanwhile, Slaughter Body suppressed Su Ming with the Blood Mountain Sword.

At this moment, the Blood Mountain Sword held by Jian Wushuang stretched to 12 meters long!

“The Blood Mountain Sword was refined for me by my Master at great cost. Its power is exceptionally mighty, and has already transcended the Eternal Weapon!”

“I’ve never really exercised its full power since I got it. And Su Ming was just suppressed by its own powers of suppression.”

“Now let me see how capable this sword is.”

Jian Wushuang had a glimmer of expectation in his eyes.

In the next moment, with an eccentric move, Jian Wushuang had passed through the void and appeared in front of Lei Xin.

The Blood Mountain Sword was scarlet like a boundless sea of blood. It gave a slight tremor and then thrust out directly.

It was a simple, casual sword, and though Jian Wushuang had unleashed his power to the utmost, he did not display any Secret Skill.

All in all, he wielded his sword in a simple and usual way.

The light of the sword was piercing and swung towards Lei Xin.

Lei Xin found that there was nothing extraordinary about the blow, so he resisted Jian Wushuang’s sword calmly with his Stone Staff.

Thus, the Blood Mountain Sword seemingly like a boundless blood sea collided straight with the Stone Staff covered with Purple Thunderbolts.

CRASH!

A low voice was heard, accompanied by a slight crack of the instrument.

“Wh-what?”

Lei Xin stared at the purple Stone Staff with his enlarged eyes.

He saw that there was a slight crack in the place where the Stone Staff hit Jian Wushuang’s sword.

Although that crack was tiny, it still made Lei Xin feel inconceivable.

At the same time, he felt the power from Jian Wushuang’s sword several times stronger than before.

That power had frightened him.

“Step, Step Six?”

No sooner had he thought of it than the terrifying power came over his arm.

“Puff!”

Blood spurted from Lei Xin’s mouth. He went deathly pale, staggered and tried to retreat.

But Jian Wushuang obviously did not intend to give him any chance to run away. After he seriously injured Lei Xin with his sword, he continued to gain momentum and took advantage of the situation to kill him.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

With an indifferent, emotionless look, Jian Wushuang urged the power of Blood Mountain Sword to the greatest extent, and then waved it for four times in succession.

Each of these four strikes was very common. They were only the simplest of cuts, without any delicate swordsmanship. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Although retreating quickly, Lei Xin still wielded his Stone Staff to ward off the four blows.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were four crash sounds consecutively. Each time the horrifying power that the Blood Mountain Sword contained would explode, which was tantamount to a hard hammer hammering Lei Xin’s heart.

After fending off four times, Lei Xin felt as if he was about to collapse completely. What made him even more frightened was that there were more and more cracks in his Stone Staff. After the fourth collision…

Crack!

A crisp sound rang out.

The Eternal Weapon in Lei Xin’s hand was considered decent but it was broken in pieces.

“How is it possible?”

“It’s an Eternal Weapon, how can it be broken?”

Lei Xin was dumbstruck, with his eyes wide open.

Jian Wushuang didn’t display any other Secret Skills, but simply changed a magic weapon. As a result, he totally outclassed him now although he only occupied a small advantage in the past.

With the previous strike, there were a total of five strikes.

It was the simple five strikes that smashed his magic weapon and seriously wounded him!

“Run!”

A trace of fear rose in Lei Xin’s heart, and he had lost all his battle intent.

When life and death were at stake, he neglected his disciple’s enmity; now he only wanted to save his own life.

He wanted to escape, but Jian Wushuang did not plan to let him off. Jian Wushuang again wielded his sword. This strike was a Secret Skill, Twilight.

It was the fastest strike.

As the sword was thrust out, a strange power immediately swept out from Jian Wushuang.

It was the Mind-controlling Secret Skill of the Ancient God Secret Skill!”

In the past 37 years, Jian Wushuang’s mastery of the three Secret Skills of the Ancient God Clan had greatly improved.

Now he fully exhibited the Mind-controlling Secret Skill that was enough to contend with an expert at Step Three of the Eternal Realm, but for an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm, it had little effect.

Unfortunately, Lei Xin had been seriously wounded, and his will was on the verge of breaking down. More importantly was that Jian Wushuang had been too close to him.
