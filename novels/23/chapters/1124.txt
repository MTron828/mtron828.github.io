Chapter 1125: Sword Emperor Arrives!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Humph!”

Heaven Shadow King snorted, and at the next moment, he was holding a drop of golden water in his palm, a drop of Ancient God Power.

“You’ve made me use the Ancient God Power. Jian Wushuang, if you die, you die in honor.”

The indifferent voice of Heavenly Shadows echoed between heaven and earth. Then, the Shadow King guided the Ancient God Power into the body.

The Ancient God Power could help a Celestial Master greatly by doubling his combat power in a short time!

Though it was not that effective to a Universe Master, it still could increase Heaven Shadow King’s battle strength by 50%.

At that time, Heaven Shadow King once again whipped the long whip.

It was still a casual blow, but the whip twisted like a giant python. It was obviously much stronger than the previous two whips.

“I can’t stand it!” Jian Wushuang suddenly squinted, and he felt he might fail to ward it off.

Suddenly… Clang!

With an echo of sword, it suddenly snowed. The whole ground was stained with white snowflakes.

The sky and the Void became cold and bone-chilling.

Heaven Shadow King looked surprised, and he could not help but stop. His black and long whip hung in the air.

He looked up and stared as far as the eyes could reach. An indifferent man carrying a long sword walked slowly in the snow toward him.

With every step he took, the snow broke at his feet.

After a long while, he arrived in front of Heaven Shadow King.

As he stopped, the snowflakes disappeared in an instant, and everything returned to normal.

Heaven Shadow King looked gloomy, his brow wrinkled as he saw the visitor.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang was also watching the person, and in his perception, this indifferent man was just a Celestial Master.

But the Celestial Master carried a horrible Sword Essence that even Jian Wushuang found terrifying.

It was this Celestial Master that made Heaven Shadow King, one of the nine kings of Jin Kingdom, stop his attack, and even look very serious.

“A strong Sword Essence.”

Gu King inside Jian Wushuang spoke. “I have seen a lot of Sword Principle experts after I have parasitized on you. Like your father, you have opened up the strongest Sword Principle. The Sword Essence that you have is quite worthwhile. However, you can’t compare with the person in front of you at all!”

“So powerful Sword Essence, and only a Celestial Master, then he is…” Jian Wushuang had already guessed the identity of the person.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor!” Heaven Shadow King bit his teeth, staring at the visitor.

In the entire Green Fire Palace, there was only one Celestial Master that could lay such pressure on him.

That was the greatest Sword Cultivator recognized by the Green Fire Palace, and one of the five Palace Master of the Green Fire Palace, Sunrise Sword Emperor!

“Heaven Shadow King.” Sunrise Sword Emperor glanced at Heaven Shadow King and spoke coolly. “You are a well-known and respected figure in the world. Don’t you think hurting a junior of our Green Fire Palace is too far?”

“Too far?” Heaven Shadow King snorted. “In this world, strength rules, as long as you have strength, so what if you go too far?”

“You are right, this world is about strength. If so, then today I want to know how great your strength is.” Sunrise Sword Emperor said coldly, and upon finishing his words, he looked up.

Like a lightning, immense Sword Essence rushed toward Heaven Shadow King.

At the same time, the surrounding world had once again become white, cold and frosty.

Carrying the long sword, Sunrise Sword Emperor lifted his right hand to draw the longsword behind him.

At the moment his palm touched the hilt, bang! Horrible Sword Essence suddenly broke out, and the blade was instantly unsheathed.

Before Jian Wushuang had the time to see the movements of Sunrise Sword Emperor, an immaterial sword shadow had already broken out.

The sword shadow looked ordinary, but when it glided over, it even left Heaven Shadow King who had reached the level of Universe Master stunned. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Immediately, aura surged from Heaven Shadow King’s body. With the help of the Ancient God Power, he released more power to brandish the long whip.

Bam!

A loud noise.

The immaterial sword shadow collided with the black long whip head-on, leaving the Void crackling.

“Humph!”

Heaven Shadow King grunted, and his face immediately paled. He no longer tried to save face and withdrew until he stopped far away from Sunrise Sword Emperor. Then, he managed to get back on his feet.

This scene left Jian Wushuang and experts from both the Jin Kingdom and Green Fire Palace in shock.

One must know that Heaven Shadow King had absorbed the Ancient God Power and displayed stronger strength.

However, Sunrise Sword Emperor confronted his opponent with his bare hands.

It turned out that he was defeated by Heaven Shadow King?

“Sunrise Sword Emperor is really something.”

The voice of Gu King rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears. “There is a great gap between the Universe Master and the Celestial Master. Even in the Eternal Chaotic World, it’s rare for a Celestial Master to challenge a Universe Master. However, Sunrise Sword Emperor not only challenged a Universe Master but also displayed power much stronger than a normal Universe Master…”

“In addition, his Sword Essence is indeed very strong, if I’m not mistaken, he must have opened up two strongest Sword Principles at the same time, and then combined them to obtain a Dharma Body.”

“Two strongest Sword Principles?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

After a round, Heaven Shadow King lost and retreated to somewhere afar. He dared not to confront Sunrise Sword Emperor again.

Many Green Fire Palace Celestial Masters appeared next to Sunrise Sword Emperor.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

“Palace Master Sunrise Sword!”

Celestial Masters all bowed, even the strongest Dark Celestial Master acted respectfully in front of Sunrise Sword Emperor.

“Palace Master?”?Jian Wushuang realized. “The Green Fire Palace now has a total of five Palace Masters. Aside from Void Temple Master, Samsara Temple Master, and Tang Emperor, the fourth should be Sunrise Sword Emperor, but I don’t know who’ll be the last fifth Palace Master.”

Sunrise Sword Emperor waved his hand and signaled everyone to get up, and then he said, “When I found Life Medicines in the nearby areas, I immediately came here. I spent a lot of time on my way here. Today I finally arrived, and it seems that it is not too late.”

Hearing the words of Sunrise Sword Emperor, many of the Green Fire Palace Celestial Masters looked pleasantly surprised.

Sunrise Sword Emperor did not come late, and it was really the right time!
