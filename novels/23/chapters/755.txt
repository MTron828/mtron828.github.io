Chapter 756: A Reunion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Destruction, did you see it clearly?” Palace Master Mo Tao asked anxiously.

They had been in a rush. He and Palace Master Ming Xin had not even cast a proper glance at the longsword Jian Wushuang was wielding.

Only Palace Master Destruction saw it.

“The sword in the Gold-armored Demon God’s hand was enlarged several times, but I still recognized it. I’m sure it was the Emperor Sword.”

Palace Master Destruction nodded again to confirm his judgment, whetting the curiosity of the Ancient Sect’s other Palace Masters.

For all time, the Emperor Sword was supposed to be in Jian Wushuang’s hands, wasn’t it?

A hundred years ago, Jian Wushuang had gotten caught up in a serious crisis in the Eternal Zone and never walked out of it. He had probably died long ago. As for the Emperor Sword, it had likely fallen into the hands of the Demon Gods.

They would not be surprised at all to see a Demon God carrying the Emperor Sword show up to kill them.

But the Gold-armored Demon God they’d just met had not intended to attack them. Considering that he was only a One-star Demon God but was carrying the Emperor Sword, they could not help but feel very skeptical about the whole thing.

“Guys, tell me, do you think the Gold-armored Demon God we met could possibly be…” Palace Master Destruction broke off.

The other four Palace Masters also fell into silence.

At this precise moment, a swoosh of wind sounded, and a figure suddenly appeared before them.

“Who’s there?”

Palace Master Destruction and the other four instantly swiveled around to look at the figure.

When they caught a clear sight him, the Palace Masters were all dumbstruck.

The black-robed figure, carrying a longsword on his back and wearing a wicked silver mask, was the same Gold-armored Demon God that had just gotten rid of Yun Fan for them.

He slowly took off his wicked mask. Then, his voice sounded, reverberating in the mountainous space.

“It’s been a hundred years since we last met. Palace Masters, I hope that you are all well.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice held a trace of sorrow, whereas a smile was curling along his lips.

After getting rid of Yun Fan, he had set off in the direction of Palace Master Destruction and the others. Sure enough, he had caught up with them and saw the five Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect assembled here.

When the five Palace Masters recognized Jian Wushuang’s face, they were stunned and soon overjoyed.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Is it really you?”

“You, you didn’t die?”

The five Palace Masters quickly approached him and blurted out their amazement at the same time. They were shocked, thrilled, and apparently blown away by this rather unbelievable miracle.

When Jian Wushuang did not walk out of the Eternal Zone a hundred years ago, almost everyone thought he was dead. The experts of the Ancient Sects also believed he had met his downfall.

But now, here he was, standing before them unscathed.

“I have a tough fate. How could I die so easily?” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

“This, this is utterly unbelievable!”

“Jian Wushuang, how did you survive?”

They stepped forward and sized him up with intense curiosity.

Human experts from the Firmament Territory often got involved in fights against Demon Gods, so the Demon God Clan hated them bitterly.

But it turned out that…

A total of a hundred years had passed!

Jian Wushuang turned out to be fine after staying a hundred years in the Demon God Clan!

“I’m just lucky.” Jian Wushuang explained half-heartedly.

After exchanging short greetings, the five Palace Masters gradually calmed down.

“Jian Wushuang, quickly tell us, what really happened? You didn’t die a hundred years ago, why didn’t you get out of the Eternal Zone in time?” Palace Master Destruction posed several questions in one breath.

“Here is my story…” Jian Wushuang gave them a summarized version of what had happened a hundred years ago.

He told them how the disciples from the Cloud Sea Asgard and the Immortal Dynasty attacked him and how the Boundless Demon Sect dispatched an Eternal Realm expert who chased him to the outer layer.

Of course, he said nothing about the Ancient God Clan arresting Wu Dao, Dao Mei, and Long Tao by luring them into a trap.

“No wonder you didn’t return in time. It turns out you were being hunted by an Eternal Realm expert from the Boundless Demon Sect and were forced to flee to the inner layer.” Palace Master Destruction scowled. Then, he let out a snort. “Humph, how ruthless the Boundless Demon Sect is! They not only send out their disciples to strike, but also dispatched an Eternal Realm Elder to turn around and assassinate you, a nobody in the Skyscraping Realm?”

“The Boundless Demon Sect is truly vicious!”

“The Boundless Demon Sect is treacherous and despicable. And the Cloud Sea Asgard and the Immortal Dynasty are not good guys, either.”

Palace Master Mo Tao and Palace Master Baiyu echoed his comments. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Thanks to my luck, I narrowly escaped from the Boundless Demon Sect expert. But due to my severe injuries, I failed to get back in time. And during the past hundred years, I stayed in the Eternal Zone. For a few special reasons, the Demon God Clan did not go hard on me. In fact, they treated me fairly well,” Jian Wushuang said.

He merely told them it was for special reasons but did not elaborate further.

Palace Master Destruction and the other Palace Masters were eloquent enough to not insist on poking into this matter.

“Right then. No matter what you’ve been through in the past hundred years, it’s enough that you’re still alive. When your Master Xuan Yi hears about this, he will certainly be very glad,” Palace Master Destruction said, beaming.

“Yeah. A hundred years ago, Palace Master Xuan Yi was furious at the news of your death. In front of all the experts of various sects, he directly launched an open attack against the Cloud Sea Asgard and killed seven of their Eternal Realm experts. It really devastated them.” Palace Master Mo Tao laughed. “But precisely for this incident, the Cloud Sea Asgard began to hold a grudge against our Ancient Sect. And this is exactly why the three of us were being chased just now.”

“Really?” His words stirred something in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

His Master, Xuan Yi had slaughtered seven Eternal Realm experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard to vent his rage when he heard of his death?

“Besides that, Jian Wushuang, your strength truly surprised us,” Palace Master Destruction added.

Mo Tao, Ming Xin, and the other Palace Masters all gazed at each other speechlessly. They smiled, but their eyes revealed a trace of terror.

Especially Palace Master Destruction, Palace Master Mo Tao, and Palace Master Ming Xin. After all, they had witnessed the fierce fight between Jian Wushuang and Yun Fan with their own eyes.

Jian Wushuang could turn into a Gold-armored Demon God, and he was thoroughly qualified to battle with Yun Fan head-on.

It was evident that his strength had reached Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

That was to say his strength was much stronger than any of theirs.

And Jian Wushuang was still a Divine Realm expert!

For people in the Firmament Territory, it was completely inconceivable that a Divine Realm expert could have a battle strength at Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

They had never heard of the existence of such a formidable Divine Realm expert within the Firmament Territory.
