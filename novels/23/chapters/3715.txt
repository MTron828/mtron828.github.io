Chapter 3719: Someone Wants to See Me?

??

Ci Hong Master was at a loss as to who to give the supreme true treasure armor to.

Jian Wushuang was the first to speak. “Master Wu Qing, are you here to fight with me for the Supreme True Treasure Armor?”

“Pinnacle True Treasure Armor?” Master Wu Qing’s pupils shrank, but he immediately relaxed, he smiled faintly and said, “Blood Sword Master, you misunderstood me. I only came here because I sensed the movement in the void. Since you came here first, and the pinnacle true treasure armor is about to fall into your hands, I have nothing to fight for.”

“After all, there must be a first come, first served basis.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The surrounding Principles Masters looked even weirder.

In the Red Cloud World, there was no such thing as a first come, first served basis for the fight for a supreme treasure?

What a joke.

“Since the fight has come to an end, I’ll take my leave.” Master Wu Qing ignored the doubts of the surrounding people and turned to leave.

Soon, Ruler Wu Qing disappeared from everyone’s sight.

This scene shocked all the Principles Masters present.

“How can this be? Ruler Wu Qing is leaving just like that?”

“He left without even thinking about the fight. Since when did this Ruler Wu Qing become so easy to talk to?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Could it be that Ruler Wu Qing is afraid of the Star Palace behind Blood Sword Master? That’s not right. Although the Star Palace is a large force, it’s not so powerful that no one dares to provoke it like the North Sea Palace. This Ruler Wu Qing shouldn’t have to worry about the Star Palace at all.”

“Or could it be that Ruler Wu Qing knows that Blood Sword Master is powerful, and he can’t do anything to him, so he can only leave, but that pinnacle true treasure armor hasn’t fallen into Blood Sword Master’s hands yet?”

The surrounding Principles Masters obviously could not understand Ruler Wu Qing’s actions.

They also could not understand why Ruler Wu Qing would leave without even thinking about fighting for it.

After all, it was a supreme true treasure armor, which was enough to make many Rulers jealous and fight for it.

The only one who was not surprised by the Ruler’s departure was Jian Wushuang himself.

“Haha, you are quite sensible.” Jian Wushuang smiled secretly.

He knew why the Ruler left. Apparently, the latter did not want to fight with him for a supreme true treasure armor.

“It’s just a pinnacle true treasure armor. It’s not a supreme true treasure. I don’t need to provoke Blood Sword Master for such a true treasure. Otherwise...not only will I be able to get it, but if I offend Blood Sword Master, not only will my secret be exposed, but Blood Sword Master can ally with the Rulers of Star Palace to kill me and even my true body.”

“Once they target me, I won’t be able to escape.”

Master Blackie had a clear idea.

If it was a supreme true treasure, he had to use it for himself, or a supreme true treasure that could tempt him. Only then would he have a chance to fight Jian Wushuang.

Otherwise, he would never dare to provoke Jian Wushuang.

Once Master Blackie left, there was no longer any suspense in the fight.

Ci Hong Master handed the supreme true treasure armor to Jian Wushuang. After checking it, Jian Wushuang found that although the supreme true treasure armor was indeed at the level of a supreme true treasure, in terms of quality, it was still inferior to his Blood Demon Cave Armor.

He certainly would not use this true treasure, but he could use it to exchange for other true treasures in the Nine Emperor Pavilion in the future.

It was already a great harvest for him to get a supreme true treasure armor in 20 years.

The fight for the supreme true treasure in the Red Cloud World continued.

In a flash, another 50 years had passed.

In these 50 years, there were already 12 supreme true treasures in the Red Cloud World, most of which were attack treasures. Jian Wushuang had only gotten one supreme true treasure armor, another pinnacle true treasure, which was even more valuable in terms of soul attacks, had been obtained by a Ruler.

The vast land was blood-red.

Hum! A faint sound of a blade was heard.

In the void space in front of them, a purple saber was floating quietly. An aura of an advanced universe true treasure emanated from the saber.

The moment the purple saber was completely born, more than a dozen Principles Masters who had been waiting around instantly swarmed over.

But suddenly...a vast Temporal energy swept out like ripples.

All the Principles Masters who were charging at the purple saber were greatly restricted by the Temporal energy, and their speed was greatly reduced.

Then, under everyone’s gaze, a ghost-like figure appeared next to the purple saber, and with a wave of his hand, he put the purple saber into his interspatial ring.

Seeing that the purple saber had been taken away by the other party, the ten Principles Masters were momentarily shocked and angry, but then they looked helpless.

Because they had clearly seen the person who had taken the purple saber.

That was Blood Sword Master, the acknowledged strongest existence among the Principles Masters of this star field.

When the purple saber fell into Blood Sword Master’s hands, they had no chance to fight for it.

Suddenly, the ten Principles Masters began to disperse.

Jian Wushuang was about to leave, but a figure rushed toward him.

“Well?” Jian Wushuang looked at the person who appeared in front of him.

“Tian Hen, greetings, Blood Sword Master,” the person said respectfully.

“Divine Master Tian Hen, What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

Jian Wushuang knew Divine Master Tian Hen. He was a strong expert at the pinnacle of the six realms, so he was not qualified to compete with him for the Supreme Treasure.

“Well, I have a good friend who wants to meet you, Blood Sword Master, so he asked me to ask you to wait here for a while,” Divine Master Tian Hen said.

“Oh? Someone wants to meet me?” Jian Wushuang looked strange. “Who’s your good friend?”

“Well, you’ll know when he arrives, Blood Sword Master,” Divine Master Tian Hen said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “Okay, I’ll stay here for a while. But I’ll only wait for an hour. If your good friend doesn’t arrive in an hour, I’ll leave.”

“Don’t worry. My good friend came to the Third Continent ten years ago when he heard that you were there. He’s not too far away from us now. He’ll arrive in an hour at most,” the Divine Master Tian Hen said.

“Then I’ll wait,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He did not know who the good friend the Divine Master Tian Hen was talking about was, but he had absolute strength. He was not worried that the Divine Master Tian Hen would plot against him.
