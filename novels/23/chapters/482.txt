Within the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared fixedly at the scarlet longsword which was beneath the Blood River.

The upper stone walls of the chamber were made up of completely transparent gems which thus allowed him to clearly see everything behind them.

The scarlet?longsword, under the gaze of everyone present, suddenly emitted the matchless Sword Qi of the Sword Ancestor.

This unsurpassed Sword Qi quickly ran through all of heaven and earth.

The scarlet longsword’s blood-red body became ever more dazzling, causing it to appear like the emperor among swords as it suspended in the air.

In Sword-suppression Valley was gathered a large number of Sword Principle experts, among whom some carried their longswords on their backs, while others kept their longswords in their Interspatial Rings. But following the appearance of the Sword Qi...

Clang clang clang clang... Within the valley, every sword which was a second-grade magic weapon or better began to point toward the Heart-killing Sword, regardless of whether they were carried on the experts’ backs or kept in Interspatial Rings.

Thousands upon thousands of weapons glowed in all shades of brilliant colors and bowed respectfully toward the emperor among swords as if they were its subjects. In turn, it let out a shrilling sword echo to indicate its enjoyment of the thousand sword salute.

“The thousand sword salute!”

The crowd of Sword Principle experts expressed their inner shock at the sight of this scene.

Even Jian Wushuang, who was in the secret chamber, was equally shocked when he saw his Triple-kill Sword bowing toward the Heart-killing Sword.

This was a thousand sword salute indeed.

The emperor among swords had received the adulation of thousands upon thousands of swords. Also, a peculiar wave had begun to spread as the salute started.

The deeply mysterious wave contained a matchless Sword Essence of Killing.

Right at this moment, everyone within the valley seemed to hear a roar coming from the Heart-Killing Sword.

“Kill! Kill everyone in the world who’s disloyal!”

“Kill! Kill everyone in the world who’s unfilial!”

“Kill! Kill everyone in the world who’s unrighteous!”

Every word of this roar was powerfully clangorous, broadly imposing, and universally shocking.

Every word contained profound mystery as it diffused throughout.

The valley turned gravely silent.

The Sword Principle experts in the valley hurriedly closed their eyes and seized this rare opportunity.

Jian Wushuang too closed his eyes. He had been unable to control his Triple-kill Sword, which remained in a reverent pose, and thus he could only use his finger as a sword as he began to practice within the secret chamber.

He exerted a strike which was extremely ordinary and dull.

It did not cause even the slightest of waves within the chamber.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his finger but quickly exerted another strike.

Every subsequent strike he exerted was?equally insipid.

However, with every strike, the sword light generated became more beautiful in a poignant sense.

After 31 successive strikes, he exerted his 32nd.

This particular strike was as dull and ordinary as the rest, but a dazzling arc light appeared in the direction of the sword light it generated.

The arc light was not only bright and dazzling, but also incomparably beautiful in a poignant sense.

So beautiful that it was enchanting!

Upon close observation, it was not difficult to see that it was the same strike which Jian Nantian had exerted the previous night.

And its name was simply “Enchant”.

It was the third move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Enchant!

Jian Wushuang had never gained understanding of this move before, but now mastered it with only a little practice, thanks to the opportunity provided by the thousand sword salute.

At the same time, he gained not only swordsmanship but also an understanding of the Slaughter Origin.

The unsurpassed Sword Qi of Killing from the Heart-killing Sword had caused him to involuntarily fall into an epiphany, which immediately provided him with a whole new understanding of the Slaughter Origin. All of a sudden, he was able to understand many of the riddles surrounding the first restriction of the Six-story Pagoda.

He remained with his eyes closed, but on his right arm, which originally had only five Slaughter Origin marks, quickly formed a sixth from the large amount of Slaughter Origin that gathered on his arm as a result of the understanding he gained from the epiphany.

The formation of the sixth mark was not the end, for a seventh began to form as well.

It took shape in only a short time.

The seventh Origin Mark!

It ought to be known that the Origin Understandings which the marks represented were equivalent to the clouds of the Cloud Realm experts, except that they were not as powerful as the latter.

This seventh mark meant that once Jian Wushuang attained the Cloud Realm, he would become a being of the Seven-cloud Realm, which was the level of the average marquis.

Despite gaining understanding of the third move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique and having the seventh mark of the Slaughter Origin formed on his arm, he remained in a state of epiphany.

Now, it was Jian Wushuang’s Sword Soul that transformed!

Originally, two firm and tough Sword Souls rested quietly within his sea of consciousness. At present, however, they were beginning to shake violently, and their volumes sharply expanded together with the frenzied sweeping across of obscure streams of Sword Essence.

Shortly after, traces of Sword Soul energy surged out from them, and a third Sword Soul gradually formed within the sea of consciousness.

At the same time, three majestic Sword Soul Phantoms appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

Each of them was nearly 100 feet tall and emitted a terrifying Sword Essence.

Three Sword Souls!

And they were all first-grade!

Jian Wushuang only came round from his epiphany after the third Sword Soul had completely taken shape.

“Three Sword Souls.”

He revealed a faint smile on his face when he felt the three Sword Souls within his sea of consciousness and the three Sword Soul Phantoms behind him.

The power of the Sword Souls was abnormally profound and exceedingly rare.

To be able to awaken three Sword Souls at the same time was something few and far between throughout the entire Divine Land. For instance, Jian Wushuang had seen only his father doing so during the Sword Principle Meeting.

However, of the three Sword Souls awakened by his father, only one was first-grade, while the other two were second-grade.

But he was different. He had awakened three first-grade Sword Souls!

“Hmm, something’s not right!”

His complexion suddenly changed, and he peered toward the three Sword Souls in his sea of consciousness.

“These three Sword Souls...”

He furrowed his brows. For some reason, upon seeing the Sword Souls, he had a false impression that they should not be separate and should instead be a single entity.

“I feel that these three Sword Souls can be joined into one?” An idea arose in his heart.

It was an idea which could be considered crazy. However, he could not inhibit it once it flashed across his mind.

“Joined as one!”

“These three Sword Souls should be joined as one!”

The Heavenly Creation Skill naturally began to operate in his body as he harbored this idea, in accordance with which the three Sword Souls in his sea of consciousness actually began to slowly amalgamate.
