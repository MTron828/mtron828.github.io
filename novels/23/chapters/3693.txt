Chapter 3694: Two Days and Three Nights

Before she disappeared, Jian Wushuang’s soul power had already locked onto her.

However, as soon as she disappeared, Jian Wushuang found that his soul power had lost its target. No matter how much his soul power swept around, he could not find any trace of her.

“Temporal, can you sense her existence?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

At present, the world was still confined by Temporal Temple Master, so logically, everything in this spacetime should be within his sensing range.

However, after hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Temporal Temple Master frowned, “No, I can’t sense her existence. It’s very likely that she has cultivated some special secret skill or has some special treasure with her. In short, I can’t sense her.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face turned extremely ugly.

“Jian Wushuang, I told you, I’m leaving. You can’t keep me here. Goodbye. I hope you’re still alive when we meet again.”

Ruler Star Luo’s voice rang out again and slowly faded away. However, the voice did come from all directions at the same time. Even though it was slowly fading away, Jian Wushuang still could not identify the position of Ruler Star Luo through the voice.

“Damn it!” Jian Wushuang could not help cursing in his heart. He was extremely angry.

He was angry not only because Ruler Star Luo had snatched the long spear and left him with a big threat in the future.

Most importantly, Ruler Star Luo was Leng Ruxue’s master. Only she knew where Leng Ruxue was.

He had thought that if Ruler Star Luo appeared, he could capture her or suppress her and force her to tell him where Leng Ruxue was. But now...he could only watch her leave. How could he not be angry?

After Ruler Star Luo left…

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are not bad. I will remember you. Soon, my true body will come here personally. At that time...I will let you die like your master, Xuan Yi, in pain and despair!”

“Hahahaha!”

A deranged laughter echoed in the air, but it gradually disappeared.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold. He looked down at the ground and slowly raised his right hand.

“Kill all Three Saint Realms!”

With Jian Wushuang’s order.

In the four directions around the Three Saint Realms, except for the four divine clans and the Four Heaven’s Sect Coalition army led by Xiao’er, the Saint Army and many Principles Masters from the other three directions all moved out.

Numerous experts were rushing toward the Three Saint Realms from different directions.

The shouts and cries of killing soared to the sky. In just a moment, the Three Saint Realms were drowned in a frenzy of fighting.

The situation in this fight was completely one-sided.

The Three Saint Realms were very strong and had a deep foundation. However, no matter how strong they were, there was still a huge gap between them and more than 90% of the high-level experts in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Not to mention, the Three Saint Realms’ biggest reliance was also the god in the hearts of countless cultivators in the Three Saint Realms. The Three Saint Realm Masters had already died. Moreover, they were easily killed by Jian Wushuang in front of countless experts in the Three Saint Realms.

The death of the Three Saint Realm Masters was too much of a shock to the cultivators in the Three Saint Realms. It also made them lose their backbone in an instant. They completely lost their fighting spirit and faced the oncoming armies, it was almost impossible to stop the effective resistance and counterattack. In the end, they were at the mercy of others.

The massacre. This war was a one-sided massacre.

Of course, Jian Wushuang would not act personally in this massacre.

After killing the three masters of the Saint Realm and giving the order to destroy the Three Saint Realms, he returned to the Void where the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and the Eternal Chaotic World were located with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master.

As for the fierce battle that followed, he just watched it coldly.

Not only him, the experts from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and the people from the Eternal Chaotic World were also watching.

The experts from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were all excited when they saw the scene in front of them.

As for the people from the Eternal Chaotic World, their faces were all pale.

To the cultivators from the Eternal Chaotic World, the scene before their eyes was simply too shocking.

Countless experts were madly fighting. Any one of these experts was unbelievably strong in their eyes. However, the experts participating in this exhibition had reached the level of a million. Such a terrifying and inconceivable battle…they had never thought about it before.

But now, they had seen it with their own eyes. It had happened right in front of them.

Moreover, they had just arrived at the Divine Beginning Realm, yet they had already seen this great battle. The shock in their hearts couldn’t be described with words.

Moreover, through this battle, they clearly understood what kind of world the Divine Beginning Realm was.

Not only were there countless experts here, but there were also endless massacres.

In this place, the Eternal Chaotic World was even crazier and crueler.

Just like the battle before them, it was extremely cruel.

“It’s too cruel. Although these Three Great Saint Realms are detestable and should be destroyed, many of the cultivators in these Three Great Saint Realms are actually innocent. In particular, many of them are children who haven’t experienced many storms. But now, they are being killed together. Almost no one can survive.”

Ji Wumeng frowned when he saw the scene in the picture. He was obviously unhappy.

Jian Nantian, who was next to him, was a little calmer.

Jian Wushuang had yet to speak when he heard Ji Wumeng’s words, but Xuan Yan, who was from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect’s camp, said directly, “Is this cruel? Wasn’t it the same when our Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed? If Xuan Yi didn’t create that layer of array, do you think that one of my Seven Star Mysterious Sect would have been left alive?

“Not to mention my Seven Star Mysterious Sect, even the entire Seven Star Divine Realm probably wouldn’t have a single living person. As for the Eternal Chaotic World formed in the future, that’s simply a joke. It’s impossible for it to exist anymore!

“This is the Divine Beginning Realm, not the Eternal Chaotic World that you’ve stayed in before. Compared to the world you’ve stayed in, this place abides by the laws of the jungle. The strong prey on the weak, and strength reigns supreme. Back then, my Seven Star Mysterious Sect’s strength wasn’t enough, and we were almost doomed. But today, the same result has happened. It’s just that the target is these Three Great Saint Realms!”

Xuan Yan’s expression was extremely cold.

The experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect also had the same expression. They did not have the slightest bit of pity toward the Three Saint Realm cultivators who had been crazily massacred. Some of them even had a trace of pleasure, this pleasure stemmed from their revenge.
