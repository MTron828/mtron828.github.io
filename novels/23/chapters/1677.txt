Chapter 1678: Hong Jun Golden Sword

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Hong Jun Golden Sword is so light?”

Jian Wushuang carried Hong Jun Golden Sword with one hand. Although he found it heavy, it was so vastly different compared to Hong Jun divine rod.

Then, he immediately drove his soul power to cover Hong Jun Golden Sword and controlled it like he controlled Hong Jun divine rod. In the end, Hong Jun Golden Sword instantly turned into a ray of golden light and flew out. Its speed was a dozen times faster than Hong Jun divine rod.

“This…” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Hong Jun Golden Sword is similar to Hong Jun divine rod. Although they are divine weapons that are driven with soul power, the difference is that Hong Jun divine rod focuses on momentum and focuses on power. Hence, it is very heavy and it is very difficult to control. On the other hand, Hong Jun Golden Sword leans towards speed and sharpness. It relies on the sword blade and the tip of the sword to kill your opponent. As a result, the weight is naturally much lighter and much easier to control.

Long Qi looked at Jian Wushuang, “Previously, I let you get used to controlling Hong Jun divine rod for you to familiarize yourself with the manipulation method of soul power, also to enhance your soul strength. You familiarized and controlled it for fourteen years, and you can barely control Hong Jun divine rod. Hence, it is naturally much easier to control Hong Jun Golden Sword.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood.

It was true. If Long Qi were to pass him Hong Jun Golden Sword right at the beginning, he could familiarize himself with it, but due to the difference in weight, he definitely wouldn’t feel as significantly at ease when he was controlling Hong Jun Golden Sword after fourteen years of familiarizing himself with it and controlling it.

Yes, he was at ease.

Just like when a commoner carried stones. At first, he would be carrying a few hundred jin stone and he would get used to the weight. One day, if he suddenly went to carry a dozen jin stone, he would naturally feel at ease.

Jian Wushuang was in that situation.

“Besides, the way you control Hong Jun Golden Sword is merely the simplest soul control but Hong Jun Golden Sword is performed via soul power in collaboration with Power of Heaven Way,” Long Qi took out a token backhandedly. “In this token, it recorded Hong Jun Golden Sword’s first form of skill. Read it carefully.”

Jian Wushuang took the token and started browsing through.

As he read, his pupils contracted in shock.

“Spacetime!”

“Hong Jun Golden Sword is performed using Spacetime Power?”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but revealed a thrilled expression.

Yes, Hong Jun Golden Sword was performed via soul power in flawless collaboration with Spacetime Doctrine. It was mainly focusing on Spacetime Power and soul power was only a means to control it. Besides, not only Spacetime Doctrine, but also Reincarnation Doctrine that Jian Wushuang comprehended could also be merged into Hong Jun Golden Sword to enhance the power of Hong Jun Golden Sword.

The skill recorded in the token was the method to perform Hong Jun Golden Sword perfectly.

“With my current soul strength, relying on merely soul to drive Hong Jun Golden Sword, the speed isn’t fast. However, with this skill to merge Spacetime Power flawlessly into Hong Jun Golden Sword…” Jian Wushuang was getting excited from the thought of it.

“The first form of Hong Jun Golden Sword had a total of nine levels. You can control an extra Hong Jun Golden Sword when you level up. So, I prepared a total of nine Hong Jun Golden Sword for you,” Long Qi said. Then he took out another eight Hong Jun Golden Swords that looked identical.

“These nine Hong Jun Golden Swords are for you. You can take your time to familiarize yourself with it and control it at your own pace.”

Then, Long Qi’s body turned illusionary and vanished into thin air before Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang put the eight Hong Jun Golden Swords into Qian Kun ring and he was confused.

He could tell that Hong Jun Golden Sword was unusual. Any one of them should be a priceless treasure, just like treasures that Jian Wushuang carried. Besides River Mountain Map, he reckoned there shouldn’t be any treasure that could be compared favorably with Hong Jun Golden Sword. It was hard to even say if Blood Mountain Sword could be compared favorably.

Such treasures, Long Qi took out nine in one go and gave them to him as a gift straightaway.

Why was Long Qi treating him so well out of a sudden?

One should know that Long Qi was very cold to him previously. He didn’t even care if he was dead or alive and let him run his own course.

But, he suddenly took out treasures like Hong Jun Golden Sword for him and purposely taught him how to use it.

Jian Wushuang felt that he didn’t do anything. He had merely broken through and become a stage two ultimate Real God, wasn’t the change of his attitude too much? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Whatever. In short, Hong Jun Golden Sword is no doubt a treasure to me. With it, my power definitely could increase by a few levels!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Jian Wushuang immediately started to drive Hong Jun Golden Sword according to the recorded skill.

In the hall.

Swoosh!

A gold flowing light lit up and the very end of the void in the hall, which was at least a dozen miles away from Jian Wushuang, suddenly cracked.

“This speed… is so fast!”

Although he was mentally prepared, Jian Wushuang still got a school when he saw the speed when Hong Jun Golden Sword launched.

The speed was too fast. It was even faster when he gave his all to perform martial art motion. The power was also terrifyingly shocking too.

It was only the first time Jian Wushuang had controlled Hong Jun Golden Sword using Spacetime Power.

“Continue, continue to familiarize!”

Jian Wushuang was excited and he immediately started to practice Hong Jun Golden Sword.

In the hall, there were constantly gold flowing lights flashing but never the substantial form of the gold flowing light.

In the blink of an eye, it had been twenty years.

In twenty years, Jian Wushuang had been familiarizing himself to perform with Hong Jun Golden Sword.

He practiced frequently every day. For the past twenty years, he didn’t know how many times he had practiced.

From the practice, the first level of Hong Jun Golden Sword in the first form, which was also the first Hong Jun Golden Sword, had finally been performed completely.

His soul power, comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine, and comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine were merged into Hong Jun Golden Sword.

When he wielded Hong Jun Golden Sword, it was already extremely terrifying.

“I have almost mastered the first Hong Jun Golden Sword, but I mostly practice alone. Next, I should bring Hong Jun Golden Sword to an actual fight,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

In the dark region, the opponent the Jian Wushuang want to fight against was naturally the Star Demons.

Jian Wushuang immediately entered the black river through the space tunnel.

Then, he didn’t hide in the river and massacre the Star Demons using River Mountain Map but he instantly plunged from the water and landed on the shore.

Back when Jian Wushuang was chased to the black river, the number of the surrounding Star Demon had been terrifying. However, after Jian Wushuang’s six massacres in the past hundred years, the remaining Star Demons were obviously fewer.
