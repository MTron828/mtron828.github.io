Chapter 939: Critical Help!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“His strength has recovered much?” A frown creased upon the brows of both Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun as a foreboding dread crept into them.

“Has his strength reached ‘that’ level?” Emperor Yun asked himself quietly.

“‘That’ level?” Emperor Xiao asked, startled.

By ‘that’, Emperor Yun referred to a height which their Teacher, the Tang Emperor had once achieved.

Even Emperor Qing, the strongest of the Four Emperors, had nearly reached ‘that’ very level of powers; so close he was from reaching his goal that his fingers could barely graze the threshold.

Still, that was none other than Emperor Qing himself. The two were still leagues and leagues behind.

“This is bad!” Emperor Xiao gasped with dismay.

Right at the moment, the figure of the soothsayer who stood before them shimmered and disappeared.

“Swoosh!”

In the flash of an instant, the soothsayer reappeared behind Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun.

“Such speed!”

Overcame by shock, both Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun felt their blood leaving their face.

The speed that the old soothsayer had unleashed confirmed their suspicions: he had reached ‘that’ very level of strength!

“You have failed before, Emperor Xiao. Why do you persist on such a vain quest?” The soothsayer’s eerie snicker reached into the ears of Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun.

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun turned around immediately.

They had barely turned, only to see that the old soothsayer was flailing the sleeve of his robe as he cast forth a terrible force of energy from within its folds.

“Bang! Bang!”

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun both felt something exploding within their bodies instantly, followed by a huge mouthful of blood that rushed up their throats. Vomitting furiously, the pair immediately plummeted from the sky, crashing down into the earth!

“Boom!”

A fresh crater had appeared; an addition to the already-wretched state of the land ravaged by battle and carnage. There came a sudden groan and another crashing crescendo: the crater had disappeared, replaced by a deep and bottomless abyss. Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun had been struck so badly that they have both been cast deep into the abyss that no signs of life came from the darkness below.

This sent a shiver of silence across the entire battlefield.

The Dao Masters and warriors fighting all paused in their tracks and beheld, with fear and awe, the invincibility of the old soothsayer.

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun are both frightening monstrosities in their own right.

Yet, now, right before the eyes of everyone present, they have been pummeled into ignominious defeat like a helpless bug before the overwhelming strength of the old soothsayer!

What indomitable strength!

“Emperor Xiao!” Jian Wushuang was also equally startled by the spectacle.

“Good gracious. What came before were merely ordinary Dao Masters despite their strengths and powers. Yet this person… he is of an utterly different class!” The Gu King’s frantic cries resounded over Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The terrible sight of the undefeable soothsayer who was afloat in mid-air became the center of everyone’s attention. His throbbing eyes, flashing with a manic glint, turned and bore straight into Jian Wushuang.

“Hahaha… Never would I expect that I would encounter one who is learned in the methods of Inverse Cultivation here in this domain.”

An eeriely ghastly laugh emitted from the throat of the old soothsayer. His eyes flared as he held Jian Wushuang in his gaze. “A student of the methods of Inverse Cultivations. Oh, the irony of Fates… you are a rare breed, even in the wide vastness of this domain… if only I have met you sooner… I might even make you my personal disciple!”

“It’s a pity that you have chosen the wrong side.”

“And for that, I will have you slay you now, for you leave me no choice.”

With that, the soothsayer’s figure shimmered once more and disappeared.

“Be careful, Jian Wushuang!” The piercing cry of the Gu King clamored hectically in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang felt his eyes contracting instantly as his foe made his move. For the first time in his life, he felt an alarming sensation tingling in his mind, warning him of grave danger the moment the soothsayer had disappeared. Without any hesitation, he kicked at the ground and leaped, trying his best to retreat to safety as fast as he could.

“Hahaha… you can’t escape.” The shrill and eerie giggle resounded once more.

So fast was his speed; a blinding flash he turned into with the quickness that startled even Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun. A speed so fast that Jian Wushuang could never hope to match.

The soothsayer was so close to catching up with Jian Wushuang when suddenly, a cold and frosty aura surged towards him.

“Ah?”

The brows of the old soothsayer rose, puzzled, as he turned. The sight of Leng Rushuang, terrible and cold, in her rippling robes of flowing white filled his sight as the frosty coldness pricked at him incessantly.

“You dare lay a finger on him?”

Leng Rushuang’s voice hummed icily through the air. With a wave of her hand, she summoned a white, icy wave of force and cast forth the energies she wielded, turning the air before her into ice instantly.

Leng Rushuang thrust forth her palm, sending forth blasts of icy jets shooting at the soothsayer.

“Hmph, parlor tricks.” The soothsayer sneered with disdain. He remained rooted to where he was, summoning merely a flicker of flames from his eyes.

“Swoosh…”?Jet-black flames burst forth suddenly, burning him and lighting up the skies in a voracious inferno that feasted on the abundance of oxygen around him, dispelling all the coldness and iciness that Leng Rushuang had summoned earlier.

“I would never have shown you mercy if not for the fact that you are Emperor Leng’s daughter! Begone now”

With his ending words, the soothsayer roared, sending forth an blistering heatwave of black flames that turned everything around him into a sea of flames which sweltering heat forced even Leng Rushuang away.

The soothsayer had not stayed his feet. In a split-second later, he reappeared directly behind Jian Wushuang.

“Die.”

The soothsayer stretched out his finger, pointing at Jian Wushuang’s fleeing back.

“No!” Jian Wushuang felt fear and panic as he felt his face turning pale.

“Blasted!” Jian Wushuang could hear the Gu King exclaiming loudly within him.

What seemed to be a simple point with his finger had in fact sent a blast of force that shot through the air with terrifying speed and intensity, leaving a corkscrew of air currents in its wake. It caught up to Jian Wushuang in an instant, leaving him no opening to maneuver to safety as it struck him directly with a massive and frightening force.

“Bang!”

Jian Wushuang felt a faint hum from within him, followed by a huge explosion that blasted a huge and bloody hole on Jian Wushuang’s torso.

With a cavity as large as a bowl, the force had driven through Jian Wushuang’s chest and exited from his back.

Even so, Jian Wushuang could still feel residual energies of the force within him, churning angrily as the energies gnawed and gnashed at his lifeforce.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang was losing control of his own movements, plunging straight down towards the ground.

Beside him, Leng Rushuangwatched with horror as Jian Wushuang fell.

“No, no!”

Leng Rushuang cried out loud, the strong and terrible cold aura emanating from her instantly soared at an unprecedented pace. With just the blink of an eye, she had achieved a newfound state of strength!

“I will kill you!”

Utter rage and malice hemmed Leng Rushuang’s threatening words.

White and icy mists began to surround and encompass around Leng Rushuang. Despite its seemingly harmless appearance, a mere strand of the fog held sufficient energies to annihilate an ordinary Dao Master. The white foggy veil enclosed around Leng Rushuang, drastically raising her powers that now began to erupt!

The sight of the falling Jian Wushuang was also witnessed by one other person aside from Leng Rushuang: Xue Lingtian, who was equally terrified watching his Junior Brother being mortally injured!

“Junior brother!”

Xue Lingtian’s face expression twisted with rage and hate as he glared at the soothsayer with burning eyes. From his robes, he produced a token in his hand.

Xue Lingtian crushed the token and immediately uttered a swift message.

“Teacher! Junior brother is in grave danger!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
