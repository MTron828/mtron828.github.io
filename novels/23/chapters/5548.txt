Chapter 5549: BetrayalTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationThe feeling was indescribable, a mix of sorrow and joy.If only she had seen through Jian Wushuang’s ambitious schemes earlier, it would have been a joyous occasion, but sadly, her heart had already been swayed.She had even fantasized about rescuing her father and living together as a family of three.All of it now turned to mere bubbles.Gong Miaoyi prostrated on the ground, hesitated for a moment, and then respectfully said, “Please, Senior, help me save my father. I am willing to do anything!”“Good! As long as you agree, those who have troubled your father will immediately disappear!” Shen Ling was overjoyed.Finally, there was a return on the investment in Gong Miaoyi.Through all the guidance, she had now been completely secured.He valued Jian Wushuang indeed, especially after Jian Wushuang discovered that giant egg and began planning how to capture him.Unexpectedly, this time, Jian Wushuang was delivered to him on a silver platter.“Trying to plot against me?” Shen Ling revealed a cold smile. “You’re far from capable!”After all, he was Shen Ling, a god with limitless powers!Although trapped in the First Prison, his influence had always been present in the Four Great Secret Realms.“Little girl, you just need to place these six soul flags in the designated locations. Once I catch Jian Wushuang, I will teleport you and Nie Yuan to a safe realm where someone will protect you both!” Shen Ling spoke earnestly.And Gong Miaoyi had no other choice.She didn’t want to wait any longer, and who knew if Jian Wushuang had ever considered saving her father?Everything was a chess piece.Perhaps, once utilized, she would be discarded.After putting away the six soul flags, Gong Miaoyi’s grimace disappeared.Before disappearing, Shen Ling reminded her, “Remember, don’t trust anything Jian Wushuang says. He is a complete and thorough liar!”Others may not know, but Shen Ling were well aware of the sordid deeds Jian Wushuang had once committed.On the other side, just after Jian Wushuang finished communicating with Wu Zuo, he sneezed abruptly. He had a strange sensation that something was wrong, and his mind was somewhat unsettled.“Could it be that Shen Ling have noticed me?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, and it was indeed a possibility.He had already instructed Wu Zuo to find a way to contact Nie Yuan and persuade him to cooperate with them.Now, there was only this method left.Killing was not an option.He could only win him over.In a corner of the mine, for some unknown reason, the guards around Nie Yuan suddenly dispersed, no longer causing trouble for him.Nie Yuan was puzzled by this, but he didn’t think too much about it. His determination was firm; he must get out of here and head to the Grave God Mountain to reverse time and revive his Dao Companion.But at this moment, a consciousness entered his body.“Nie Yuan!”The voice was familiar to Jian Wushuang, it was Wu Zuo personally transmitting his message.Only three people were currently aware of this matter, and Nie Yuan became the fourth.The first three were Zhen Ling, Wu Zuo, and Jian Wushuang. If these three joined forces, the entire Qishen Temple would be in danger of destruction.For Nie Yuan, a tier 5 Emperor, to know such top-secret information, especially regarding the safety of the Qishen Temple, was already quite fortunate.If this plan succeeded, reviving his Dao Companion would be a minor matter.After all, it was only reviving one person. Even those Emperors who fell in the Four Great Secret Realms could be resurrected.Unless their mental consciousness collapsed, they could be revived.Zhen Ling possessed this ability; reviving a tier 4 Emperor was a piece of cake.Gong Miaoyi’s mother was just a tier 4 peak-level Emperor, and it wouldn’t consume much power from the Origin Source Sea.When Nie Yuan heard the voice in his mind, he was stunned. He initially thought it was an auditory illusion, and in his astonishment, he considered it a hallucination caused by the fragility of his mental and spiritual strength—a sign of impending death!He had many unfinished tasks and dared not face death. Moreover, since his birth, there hadn’t been a single era, so how could there be signs of weakness in his mental consciousness?“Don’t be surprised! I come from the Elder Palace. My name is Wu Zuo.”Upon hearing that it was someone from the Elder Palace, Nie Yuan felt a mixture of astonishment and anger.He had been harmed by individuals from the Elder Palace, and now his disciple had been taken away. He harbored deep-seated hatred for the Elder Palace, especially the Law Enforcement Hall.“Wu Zuo?” Nie Yuan had not yet responded when he recalled this familiar yet terrifying name.Wu Zuo?This name resonated loudly in the Northern Territory, or rather, in the entire Heavenly Realm.If the two Vice Hall Masters of the Law Enforcement Hall were executioners, then Wu Zuo was the king who judged all living beings!Leaving aside how terrifying the other party was, the more pressing question was why Wu Zuo sought him out. This was a profound issue.However, Wu Zuo didn’t give Nie Yuan a chance to speak. For him, Nie Yuan was just a small figure. If Jian Wushuang wanted to protect him, Wu Zuo wouldn’t bother explaining anything to a native Emperor.“Listen carefully to every word I say next. Don’t ask questions, and don’t harbor any doubts. Just follow my instructions!” Wu Zuo’s tone was domineering.Nie Yuan didn’t buy into this, retorting immediately, “Hmph! Even if you’re Wu Zuo, the Hall Master of the Elder Palace, it doesn’t matter. Without distinguishing right from wrong, you’re no different from the demonic path. Don’t say anything more—I won’t agree to anything!”With these words spoken, it was Wu Zuo’s turn to be astonished!When had a native Emperor dared to speak to him like this?Did they not fear him?He was Wu Zuo, the Hall Master of the Enforcement Hall, a former disciple of Qishen, a peak existence among the supreme-peak, and none of the three Palace Masters were his match.If it weren’t for the fact that the Elder Palace was the personal force of Zhen Ling, he would have already taken turns beating the three Palace Masters.They were nothing more than slaves plundered and brought to build the Qishen Temple, how could they be qualified to sit on an equal footing with him? Not to mention that he still didn’t have the qualification to sit on an equal footing now, which was the most detestable part.In the past, with his temperament, he wouldn’t even deign to enter the Elder Palace. But now, because of the appearance of Zhen Ling, he had also been deprived of his identity as Qishen’s disciple.Otherwise, he wouldn’t have colluded with those people from the Elder Palace.Now, he was actually scolded by a native Emperor, and he didn’t even know how to respond.This was the most aggrieving.If it weren’t for the sake of Jian Wushuang’s face, he would have crushed Nie Yuan long ago.For the greater plan, for the bigger picture.He could only endure.“Nie Yuan, listen carefully, the things to come are related to your daughter!” Wu Zuo’s voice became heavy.Then, he slightly concealed part of the plan and told Nie Yuan.He particularly mentioned the matter concerning Gong Miaoyi.Nie Yuan was completely stunned; his daughter was still alive?And right in this mine.Daughter!In his originally desolate heart, a hint of warmth emerged.His daughter was still alive, but her mother had fallen. However, Wu Zuo also promised him that as long as he cooperated, not only could they leave here, but they could also go directly to the Grave God Mountain to resurrect his Dao Companion.
