Chapter 5384 - 5384: Dog Emperor

Translator: Endlessæantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Bai Junwang within his body transformed, taking on a solid form, and appeared in the seat.

“Imperial Dog!” Bai Junwang revealed a faint smile.

In the past, calling someone a ‘dog’ was to give face to Zhu Qing, but now he came to seek help, so he naturally had to address with respect.

“Senior Bai, no need to say more if it’s too much. If you’re not at ease, you can leave!” The old man with goat horns hadn’t completely integrated into this new identity, and his words were somewhat hasty in the beginning, only realizing it later.

Now, he could only show a slightly displeased expression.

He felt speechless. Things had turned out this way, turning good intentions into a mess.

Bai Junwang was a person of great stature, and negotiations were naturally not empty words. Hearing this, he spoke in a gentle tone, “Don’t be angry, we come here with sincerity. When seeking help, how can we not offer compensation!”

As the words fell, Jian Wushuang respectfully took out a small box.

Inside, there was only a mustard seed!

“Please!”

Bai Junwang made a gesture of invitation, giving plenty of face.

The old man with goat horns picked up the mustard seed, sensing it slightly, and almost burst out laughing.

100 billion godstones!

Originally, he had no concept of godstones.

Now, after obtaining the memories of the Great Xia Patriarch, he had an understanding.

For a tier 5 Emperor, 100 billion was a decent fortune.

But for a tier 6 Emperor, it was just some trash.

Not even a handy Eternal Treasure could be bought with it.

Jian Wushuang noticed the disdain in the other’s eyes and quickly spoke, “Senior, rest assured, this is just a token of goodwill. Feel free to ask for anything. 1 will go through fire and water for what is possible.”

Disguised as the Dog Emperor and then as the old horned man of Great Xia’s Patriarch, he felt a bit dizzy.

Without further ado, he handed the mustard seed to Jian Wushuang and then took out a piece of black shining godstone.

“Don’t waste words. Swear the cosmic oath directly, so you can be at ease, right?”

Both Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang were a bit stunned.

So direct, so straightforward!

“Oh, by the way, this oath, 1 and Senior Bai will take it. You don’t qualify yet,” the old horned man said, harboring resentment towards Bai Junwang.

Bai Junwang didn’t mind.

The oath was quickly sworn.

All were delighted!

The old horned man tentatively offered help to the origin source, but Jian Wushuang refused, and there was no insistence.

Jian Wushuang had been exploring the refinement of the origin source for a long time and had some grasp of it.

The key was the blood crystal of the Gold Beast God.

Gold represented space, and the Candle Dragon was a space Beast God.

The two were connected.

There were many Gold Beast Gods, and it didn’t necessarily have to be the blood crystal of the Candle Dragon, as long as the origin source among them was the same.

He was confident in this.

Crucially, his power of all things corresponded to the entire spatial existence.

He had even greater plans.

Since his Extreme Dao origin source corresponded to the entire spatial existence, could he directly use it, transform it into a spatial origin, and use Thought power to create a new Beast God origin?

All of this had to wait until the fusion of the Beast God Weapon to be tested.

“Wait here! I’ll use the speed of time, and it will take about an hour!”

Jian Wushuang hurriedly expressed his gratitude.

Merging with the Beast God Weapon was probably something that couldn’t be accomplished in a thousand years for most, but the other party managed it in just an hour, likely using a speed multiplier of a hundred thousand.

It felt like it had been a thousand years.

This hour seemed exceptionally long, and even when his state of mind was at the fifth level, he couldn’t achieve tranquility.

After the Heartsword Trial struggled to keep up with his advancements, his pursuit of Heart power seemed to lack the fervor it once had.

Now that he had been in the fifth level for a long time, there was no change in his mental state, even though he had almost fallen back then.

It seemed that he had reached the end of this path.

Heart power, Thought force, Devouring, and All Things… They were all interconnected.

Reflecting on the years mastering the Extreme Dao, his strength had skyrocketed, and for a while, he lost himself in the process.

In the past, his mental state or state of mind was so formidable that it could still dominate enemies, but now he felt somewhat lofty.

Jian Wushuang turned around, looking towards the ancestral temple, and a hint of awe appeared in his eyes.

It was time to be reverent; otherwise, an unexpected event could lead to his downfall on the path ahead.

Creak!

The door of the grass hut opened, and Yang Sanmu walked out, holding a light red sphere in his hand.

Glancing at Bai Junwang sitting beside the stone table, he spoke, “Give it a try!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, he tossed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang held it with one hand, feeling the powerful aura inside, leaving him astonished.

Because Bai Junwang wasn’t inside him, but the first trace of aura contained an image.

It was the scene of Qiuhuang City.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang fully understood.

He looked at Yang Sanmu, and his expression changed, and finally, he respectfully bowed without uttering a word.

“Alright, let’s give it a try first!” The old man with sheep horns waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang also felt a strong impact. He directly threw the sphere into the air, and his whole body floated up as his aura gradually soared.

Crash!

The sphere shattered, transforming into a pair of wings. Above the wings, there was a crimson eye, and the wings enveloped the Candle Dragon Armor.

He turned into a stream of light, directly integrating with the Beast God Weapon, becoming a veritable Asura at that moment.

Without the origin source, the Beast God Domain had not yet advanced.

Now, the Beast God Weapon had only strengthened some harmonizing power, but it still elevated this treasure to a higher level.

Its previous effects were average, with Candle Dragon Wings comparable to imitated eternal treasures, and the armor comparable to eternal treasures.

The Candle Dragon Eye was somewhat special.

In the outside world, it could achieve a power increase of 10,000-fold, making it a decent treasure, at least sufficient for a tier 3 Emperor.

But in places like the Four Great Secret Realms, where ancient legacies abounded, the role of the Beast God Eye was minimal, with an increase only within 10,000-fold.

It was even somewhat redundant for use by a Dao Lord.

This had significantly diminished its value.

Now, after merging together, the faint Candle Dragon origin source within the Candle Dragon Eye became even scarcer, in desperate need of nourishment.

Only by allowing the Candle Dragon’s origin source to recover could the Beast God’s Domain be elevated.

At that time, his strength would likely approach the peak of the tier 4.

The path of divine body cultivation he walked was arduous.

100 billion godstones—if used properly—could yield a divine body of 30,000-fold in potency.

This level was the norm for most tier 5 Emperors.

Tier 4 Emperors, on the other hand, could reach around 40,000-fold.

Even for tier 6 Emperors following the path of cultivating divine bodies, reaching 50,000-fold was the pinnacle.

The ancestral figure from the Heavenly Demon Sect, with twelve arms and a Heavenly Demon’s body, was able to dominate the tier 6 with a divine body of 50,000-fold.

Breaking through the 50,000-fold mark to reach the terrifying level of Bai Junwang was no simple feat. It required cosmic-level secret techniques and numerous suitable treasures.

The forging of divine bodies using the Five Elements treasures was merely a foundation.

After all, cultivators were not inherently Special Life Forms.

Individuals like Jian Wushuang, born as a Special Life Form, didn’t even fall into the category of typical Special Life Forms.

Since widening his perspective, Jian Wushuang realized how terrifying the inheritance Xuan Yi had given him was. The ‘Myriad Dao Scripture’ bestowed upon him initially was truly formidable.
