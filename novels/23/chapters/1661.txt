Chapter 1662: Targeted

“It is my pleasure to be able to make friends with an expert like you, Real God Peng Huo.”

As Jian Wushuang laughed, he put Real God Peng Huo’s transmission token into his Qian Kun Ring. After that, he moved his body and continued to hunt for Star Demons in his vicinity.

Time passed by. In a flash, another twenty years had passed.

Inside a cave that had been opened as a temporary place in the core region, Jian Wushuang was sitting down with his legs crossed and Demon Cores were floating in front of him. At the same time, a great amount of pure power was flowing into his body continuously.

As Jian Wushuang absorbed the pure power from the Demon Cores, the Ultimate Divine Power within his body continued to increase and another Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was formed.

“I have five droplets of Ultimate Divine Power now!” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes fiercely and his eyes were glowing brilliantly.

For the past few years, he had been travelling in the core region and he had also managed to kill many Star Demons. As such, he had naturally obtained a great number of Demon Cores.

As for the pure power within the Demon Cores that he had obtained, it had all been absorbed by him over the past few years when he had secluded himself in the cave. Thus, the number of Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets in his body had increased from three water droplets to five water droplets.

The two additional droplets of Ultimate Divine Power could not be treated lightly. Jian Wushuang was certain that if he were to rely on his own abilities to train and accumulate the two additional droplets of Ultimate Divine Power, he would need tens of thousands of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years, to form them.

However, in the core region of the Eighth Lair, he had only used twenty years’ time!

To any random Real God, twenty years of time was just a very short period of time. If he were to hurry to his intended location or go to a random place, he would easily use more than twenty years of time.

However, in such a short twenty years of time, Jian Wushuang’s abilities had risen greatly.

Five droplets of Ultimate Divine Power… he was getting closer and closer to making a breakthrough to Stage Two Ultimate Real God.

Jian Wushuang was in a state of happiness. However, at that very moment, a message was sent to him abruptly.

“Little friend Jian Wushuang, are you still travelling in the core region?” the person who sent the message over was Real God Peng Huo.

“Yes, I’m still there. Does Real God Peng Huo have something for me?” Jian Wushuang replied with a laugh.

“I do not have anything for you and I’m just asking randomly. Also, let me ask you another question. Is there a grudge between you and the Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Real God Peng Huo said.

“The Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave, “Yes, there’s a grudge between us. What’s wrong?”

“No wonder,” Real God Peng Huo laughed, “Little friend, let me tell you the truth. Just a moment ago, an expert of the Soaring Heaven King Palace contacted me and asked me if I have seen you in the Eighth Lair.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted, “How did you answer him?”

“Of course, I said that I have not seen you. Moreover, the expert from the Soaring Heaven King Palace also told me to inform him if I were to see you in the future. In addition, he told me not to bring this matter up in front of anyone else. At that time, I felt that something was wrong and hence, I agreed to his request on the surface. After that, I contacted you straight away to ask you about it. As expected, there is indeed a grudge between you and the Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Real God Peng Huo said.

“Seems like the Soaring Heaven King Palace has their eyes on me?” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned icy-cold.

“Little friend, although I have never had any dealings with the Soaring Heaven King Palace before, I know something about them. Their ways of doing things have always been unreasonable. If anyone in the Ten Sanctuaries were to provoke them, they would definitely get the other party to pay a heavy price for it. Now, since the Soaring Heaven King Palace has their eyes on you, nothing good will come of it,” Real God Peng Huo said.

“I know. Thank you very much for telling me about this matter. If not, the Lineage of Star who is supporting me would still be clueless about this,” Jian Wushuang said thankfully.

He knew that although the Soaring Heaven King Palace was searching for him, their method of searching was very secretive. They probably did not want to alert him and it was to the extent that even the Lineage of Star did not know about it.

If not for Jian Wushuang making friends with Real God Peng Huo by coincidence, he would still be clueless at that very moment.

“Little friend is too modest. The only thing is that this is not a small matter and you had better deal with it carefully,” Real God Chi Huo said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head seriously, “How about this? Real God Peng Huo, I will talk to Hall Master Yuan first and I will look for you again later.”

“Alright,” Real God Peng Huo said sincerely.

Jian Wshuang took out Hall Master Yuan’s transmission token at once.

“Hall Master Yuan, do you know if the Soaring Heaven King Palace has sent experts to the Eighth Lair during this period of time?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“They did not send anyone,” Hall Master Yuan said confidently. “I have already gotten people to observe the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Therefore, I can confirm that the Soaring Heaven King Palace has not sent any experts to the Eighth Lair during this period of time. Not even Eternal Real Gods were sent.”

“What about exceptionally strong experts coming to the Eighth Lair during this period of time?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

Thinking about it, if the Soaring Heaven King Palace really wanted to kill him, they could hire other experts to take care of him. Moreover, the experts who they had hired would be experts who travelled alone.

“The Eighth Lair is ranked the last among the Eight Lairs. Hence, among the experts who travel there, there are not many exceptionally strong ones to begin with. Real God Peng Huo’s way of doing things is strange and he can be considered a special case. Apart from that, no unreasonably strong Chaotic Real Gods will go to the Eighth Lair. Over the past few years, there are only three Chaotic Real Gods who have gone into the Eighth Lair. Moreover, their abilities are normal and none of them is a top Chaotic Real God,” Hall Master Yuan said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“There isn’t anyone?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Jian Wushuang, why are you asking about this so suddenly?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“You will know after a short period of time,” Jian Wushuang kept Hall Master Yuan in suspense.

Hall Master Yuan did not ask too much either.

Inside the cave, Jian Wushuang was muttering to himself, “Since the Soaring Heaven King Palace is searching for me, they naturally want to take care of me. However, since they did not send any experts to the Eighth lair, this means that they only want to rely on their own experts who are in the Eighth Lair to kill me.”

The thought that the Soaring Heaven King Palace would get some of their experts who were travelling in the Eighth Lair to kill him had also crossed his mind before.

However, there were not many experts travelling in the Eighth Lair to begin with. Next, the Eighth Lair was so huge. Hence, it would not be easy to come across a human cultivator, even on ordinary days. Even if they were to come across a human cultivator, it would be difficult to find one who possessed sufficient abilities and was also willing to take action for the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Thus, the possibility of the Soaring Heaven King Palace hiring experts who were travelling in the Eighth Lair was very low.

As such, they could only get their own experts, who were already travelling in the Eighth Lair, to take action.

“There is a total of four experts from the Soaring Heaven King Palace travelling in the Eighth Lair. Among them, there is an Eternal Real God, two normal Chaotic Real Gods as well as a top Chaotic Real God. The Eternal Real God and the two normal Chaotic Real Gods will not pose a threat to me. Therefore, it is only possible for Real God Zi Ye, the top Chaotic Real God, to kill me.”

While thinking about that, Jian Wushuang grinned. After that, he took out Real God Peng Huo’s transmission token again.

“Real God Peng Huo, I have a matter that I would like your help with…”
