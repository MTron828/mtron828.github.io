Chapter 1734: Coming After Me!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Retreat!”

The spiritual figure was very determined. He didn’t hit his target and he immediately retreated.

He was a killer hidden in the dark, an assassin. He wasn’t used to fighting head-on.

“Want to run?” There was a billowing murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. After the stroke failed to hit, there were immediately two rays of resplendent golden light that burst out.

Hong Jun Golden Swords were like comets. They flew through the void and appeared behind the spiritual figure, then instantly pierced the body of the spiritual figure.

However, it didn’t touch any substantial form when it pierced and the spiritual figure vanished into thin air.

Jian Wushuang looked around him and swept out his soul power but he couldn’t notice anyone.

“Such a brilliant hiding skill and assassination skill!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hand as his face went solemn.

It was obvious that the spiritual figure had been lurking behind him but his soul power didn’t notice him at all. His hiding skill was definitely very impressive.

The assassination skill then really shocked Jian Wushuang.

Ever since his cultivation, he had never seen such a terrifying assassination skill.

Not only did he grasp the perfect timing, but also the dagger… the dagger was too terrifying.

“King of Venomous Worms, luckily you took action in time. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang had a lingering fear.

He knew clearly that King of Venomous Worms had reminded him just in time and the tentacle that extended behind his back simultaneously was from King of Venomous Worms as well.

If it wasn’t because of the tentacle that delayed for a moment, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to dodge the attack of the dagger in time.

“I just happened to wake up. Luckily, it was in time,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head. He sighed with emotion as he spoke.

The earlier scene had been too dangerous.

If King of Venomous Worms had woken up any later, Jian Wushuang would have died.

“Oh yeah, what was going on earlier? I could tell that he should be an Almighty. Jian Wushuang, since when did you qualify for an Almighty to assassinate you?” King of Venomous Worms asked in surprise.

When King of Venomous Worms had been asleep, Jian Wushuang had broken through and become a Real God in Ancient God Sanctuary.

It wasn’t long since then but when he woke up again, he had seen an Almighty trying to kill Jian Wushuang.

What an honor for an Almighty to assassinate him!

“During the time when you slept, I received some opportunities and my power increased tremendously. Now, I have the fighting power of an Almighty,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Fighting power of an Almighty?” King of Venomous Worms was thrilled in excitement.

“Let’s not talk about this first. My current situation is abnormal,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

King of Venomous Worms had noticed the surrounding void and the terrifying dark storm. In addition to the ambush by the Almighty earlier, Jian Wushuang was obviously in a bad situation.

“What’s going on?” King of Venomous Worms asked.

“What happened was…” Jian Wushuang briefly told it the ins and outs of the story.

“Previously, I had thought it was only an accident that Lei Chao had gotten trapped in Buddhist Demon Sea. But from what it seems now, I’m afraid that isn’t so,” Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

He wasn’t stupid. On the contrary, he had been through tough experiences and struggled to climb up in the ocean of blood.

When he had found out the news that Lei Chao was trapped in Buddhist Demon Sea, Jian Wushuang had found it strange but he didn’t bother much.

But then, after the assassination, Jian Wushuang finally understood.

He was almost certain that it wasn’t an accident but a strategy, meticulously plotted.

And, the person who framed him definitely wasn’t Lei Chao. He was eighty percent only bait. Their true target was actually… him!

“These people are specially coming after me!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

With such a meticulous plot they could arrange an Almighty for an assassination. On top of that, the Almighty’s assassination skill was so terrifying. It was obvious that he was trying to kill him.

“Jian Wushuang, when I was in a deep sleep, which experts did you offend? The enemy’s stratagy isn’t ordinary,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice grew serious.

“In Eternal Chaotic World, there’s only a great force that crossed paths with me and wanted me dead. It is Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, although Soaring Heaven King Palace is strong, it is impossible for them to be so liberal with their funds, nor is it possible for them to scheme against me in Buddhist Demon Sea. They don’t have the capability,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Although Soaring Heaven King Palace was strong, they didn’t have that many Almighties. Plus, everyone was aware of the danger in Buddhist Demon Sea. If Soaring Heaven King Palace were to scheme against Jian Wushuang, they wouldn’t opt to within Buddhist Demon Sea.

The risk was too high.

As it wasn’t Soaring Heaven King Palace, the one who had the ability and had the intention to do so would be the hidden force of Eternal Chaotic World.

“Acheron Palace!”

“What happened today is ninety-nine percent likely to be Acheron Palace’s doing.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew distressed.

Acheron Palace was known for its bad name.

Jian Wushuang harbored scruples about Acheron Palace as well.

Acheron Palace wouldn’t take action hastily. If they did, it would be almost impossible for them to miss the target.

Then, Acheron Palace had launched an attack at him and it had been meticulously planned. They even used Lei Chao as the bait to lure him to Buddhist Demon Sea.

Then, he was already in the trap that Acheron Palace set up. He was in a very bad place.

“King of Venomous Worms, as you completed your transformation and woke up, you should be able to help me, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, a Plenilune’s power is determined by the Ancient God that it lives off. Due to your influence, my change is drastic and my attack power can be put to use as well,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“That’s great,” Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze, “As Acheron Palace took action against me, they definitely did thorough research on me. They definitely know some of my trump cards and they will have prepared accordingly. However, there are some trump cards that I have never shown anyone. These trump cards will be a crucial part of how I can escape this disaster!”

“King of Venomous Worms, you are one of the trump cards I have now too. The two of us should fight against the people from Acheron Palace together.”

“It’s my honor,” King of Venomous Worms replied.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and his gaze became sharp.

He knew that he had fallen into the trap that Acheron Palace had plotted against him. As he was already there, it would be impossible for him to return by the same route.

Even if he were to inform Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin about his situation, Hall Master Gu Xin was quite far away from the triangle island that he was on. He couldn’t be there in time to back him up on such short notice. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hall Master Yuan couldn’t help either.

He had no choice.

He could only fight head-on with the people from Acheron Palace.

He could only rely on himself.

As for if it was life or death, that depended on his capability.
