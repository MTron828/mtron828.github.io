Chapter 690: Hu Hu’s Real Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hu Hu in astonishment.

After Hu Hu swallowed the elixir, the huge wound on his right arm began to recover at a speed visible to a naked eye.

His right arm recovered completely in a moment.

“How could this be possible?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

Hu Hu waved his right arm slowly for a while and a smile appeared on his face.

“Fortunately, I’ve collected many treasures these years. The elixir which can heal my injury immediately is extremely precious, but I happened to have one,” Hu Hu grinned, staring at Jian Wushuang, “You’re an Ancient Sect disciple and a real genius. As a Skyscraping Realm expert, you possess the strength of an advanced Divine Realm expert. If you die, I guess the Ancient Sect will feel extreme loss and pain.”

Jian Wushuang sneered, “Hu Hu, you should know that you’ll be the one to die today.”

“Really? Let’s see who’ll be left standing.”

As soon as Hu Hu finished his words, he turned into a red shadow and approached Jian Wushuang quickly. With vast Spiritual Power bursting out from him continuously, he changed the axe to his right hand and hacked toward Jian Wushuang.

The sky immediately darkened.

Jian Wushuang felt that he was directly suppressed by a horrifying force, which was obviously stronger than that of the 10 Divine Realm experts he killed before. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as bright as lightning. He raised the Emperor Sword high with both hands, soaring Sword Essense spreading from the sword.

“Violet Calamity Sword Skill!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and swung the Emperor Sword which was held high up, furiously.

A bright purple light appeared suddenly, which instantly overshadowed all the other lights in the area.

This beautiful sword stroke contained a terrifying aura.

Violet Calamity Sword Skill, which was modified from the Violet Star Destroying Sword Skill was created by Jian Wushuang and had even greater power. It was a Rank Four Superior Secret Skill.

The beautiful sword light met with the violent axe shadow of Hu Hu.

The moment they collided, the result was decided in an instant.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang watched in shock how his strongest move was directly crushed by the violent Axe Shadow. After the collision, the residual force of the Axe shadow swept toward him.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a grunt as he was knocked backward.

“Kid, go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang heard an angry shout from the top of his head. As soon as he raised his head, he found a huge and furious Axe Shadow above him which brought him tremendous pressure. He immediately lifted his longsword to block it.

Bang!

With a loud boom, Jian Wushuang was knocked to the ground so forcefully that a huge deep pit was left at the point of impact and even the whole castle sank.

“Is he dead?”

Hu Hu stood in the Void with a cold expression, overlooking the huge pit below.

Right at this moment, the gravel in the huge pit shifted, followed by a figure that dashed out of the huge pit and appeared in front of Hu Hu.

“Humph?” Hu Hu looked at Jian Wushuang with a cold expression and said, “Boy, you do have a strong body.”

“Hu Hu.”

Jian Wushuang stared at Hu Hu and said in a deep voice, “I underestimated you, and so has everyone, including the Ancient Sect. We thought you were at most an advanced Divine Realm at the top level. No one had expected that you had become a superior Divine Realm expert!”

“Superior Divine Realm?”

Hu Hu smiled noncommittally and said, “Though I’m not extremely talented, I’m not a trash without any talent. I’ve stayed at the advanced Divine Realm for so many years, is it strange that I’ve broken through and entered the level of superior Divine Realm? I just rarely show my full strength in front of others.”

“Boy, you should feel lucky that you can see my real strength.”

“Lucky?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and smiled at the same time. “You’re right. I really should be lucky to meet you; otherwise, the task I received wouldn’t be challenging at all.”

“What do you mean?” Hu Hu’s expression darkened slightly.

As he had already shown his strength as a superior Divine Realm expert, Jian Wushuang should have been frightened. Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang turned out to be excited instead.

Hu Hu could see clearly the excitement in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Hu Hu.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Hu Hu with excitement. “My mission this time is to kill 11 Divine Realm experts, including six Medium Divine Realm experts and five advanced Divine Realm experts. Before I came here, I’ve already killed other 10 experts. However, they were too weak to force me to exert all my strength. Fortunately, my last goal is you, a superior Divine Realm expert.”

“I’ve cultivated in seclusion for six years. Now I will use you to test my progress over the past six years.”

A mighty battle intent spread from Jian Wushuang and soared straight into the air.

“Use me to test your progress over the past six years? How arrogant!” Hu Hu flew into a rage.

“Enough talk. Let’s fight,” Jian Wushuang licked his lips and his eyes sparkled. The next moment he rushed forward.

Swoosh!

A strange figure suddenly appeared beside Hu Hu.

“So fast!”

Hu Hu was shocked at Jian Wushuang’s speed.

Jian Wushuang drew his sword out. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Sword shadows burst out one after another at amazing speed.

The condensed Sword Heart in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness was shaking violently as its power reached its extreme!

When Jian Wushuang fought with Divine Realm experts like Bing Ji before or with Hu Hu just now, he only used 70 percent of the Sword Heart’s power. But now he brought forth its power to full effect.

That meant Jian Wushuang was using all his strength. At the same time, with only a thought, the Emperor Sword in his hand released terrible Killing Intent which swept around.

“An Eternal Weapon!”

Hu Hu was taken aback greatly.

When Jian Wushuang fought with him before, he had not used the power of Emperor Sword.

Emperor Sword, as an Eternal Weapon, had much more power than those Divine Weapons. By virtue of the power of the Eternal Weapon, the overall strength of Jian Wushuang had been greatly enhanced.
