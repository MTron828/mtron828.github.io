Chapter 2843: Holy Heaven Furnace and Earth Flame

——

“It’s not difficult to make this magic weapon. Just give me three days to prepare it. By the way, have you prepared the essence blood?” Lord Mo asked.

“I have prepared the essence blood, but not much. I don’t know if it can satisfy my appetite for this magic weapon,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It doesn’t matter. If it really doesn’t work, I have accumulated a lot of blood essence from a powerful bloodline. I will just take some out.” Lord Mo smiled and said, “In that case, please wait here quietly for three days.”

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Lord Mo began to prepare carefully, while Jian Wushuang waited quietly in the scarlet space.

Three days passed quickly.

Lord Mo appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again.

“Sword One, everything is ready. Come with me.” Lord Mo smiled and led the way.

Jian Wushuang followed Lord Mo and continued to walk toward the depths of the castle, or to be exact, the deepest part of the underground.

After walking for about an hour, Jian Wushuang finally came to a vast open space.

This open space was a high platform. If Jian Wushuang did not expect it, it should be at the core of a giant volcano. Beneath it and around it, there was red magma.

It must be known that the volcanoes in the mountain range occupied by fire cloud castle were hundreds of thousands of years old, or even millions of years old!

Jian Wushuang was now in the oldest volcano among the volcanoes, which had existed for more than 30 million years!

The temperature of the lava in the deepest part of the 30-million-year-old volcano was frighteningly high.

Jian Wushuang was able to stand in the open space in the center of the volcano due to his powerful body-protection ability. However, if it were an ordinary Great Divine Master, he would have to exert all his divine power to resist the scorching temperature, however, it would consume too much divine power.

Under normal circumstances, even a Great Divine Master would not stay in the open space for long.

Lord Mo was a powerful Immortal Saint, so he did not care about the temperature.

“Sword One, how do you feel? Have you adapted to this place?” Lord Mo asked with a smile.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly, but it was extremely relaxed.

After coming to this open space, Jian Wushuang’s eyes had already locked onto the thing in the center of the open space.

It was a huge fiery red cauldron.

Yes, it was a cauldron.

It was used to refine elixirs or weapons.

The reason why this cauldron attracted Jian Wushuang’s attention was that the aura it emitted was very strong.

“With such a strong aura, this cauldron should be a holy treasure, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, it’s a holy treasure.” Lord Mo smiled. “This cauldron is called the Holy Heaven Furnace. Many years ago, I spent a lot of effort and money to get it. Although it doesn’t have any offensive or defensive power, if I use it to refine weapons or elixirs, it will be twice the result with half the effort. Naturally, it will be very useful to me.”

“I am only a top seventh-grade blacksmith, but if I use the Holy Heaven Furnace to refine weapons, I can barely reach the eighth-grade level in a short period of time. Naturally, I have a greater chance of refining treasures.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and nodded inwardly.

The Holy Heaven Furnace was indeed very helpful to refining weapons, as it could make a top seventh-grade blacksmith exert the abilities of an eighth-grade blacksmith.

“This old man hasn’t opened this sacred heavenly furnace for many years. Normally, even if I were to refine a divine weapon for someone, an ordinary cauldron would be sufficient. However, this time...” Lord Mo faintly smiled and fiercely waved his large hand, a special seal smashed towards the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

Bang!

The Holy Heavenly Furnace also violently shook, as if it was responding.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Rise the furnace!”

Lord Mo’s voice sank, and a majestic divine power instantly surged out.

The moment these two words left his mouth, the volcano that had existed for 30 million years, which was originally incomparably calm, began to roar crazily.

The entire empty land, including the entire volcano, was shaking crazily, and the shaking was becoming more and more intense.

While it was shaking crazily, fire pillars swept toward the Holy Heaven Furnace from all directions.

There were nine fire pillars, and the most important thing was that the flames contained in the nine fire pillars were purple-black!

They were purple-black!

The nine purple-black fire pillars completely covered the Holy Heaven Furnace, and in an instant, the entire open space turned into a sea of purple-black flames.

“Good boy.”

Jian Wushuang was also standing on the open space, but he happened to be outside of the sea of purple-black flames. He looked at the sea of flames in front of him with a trace of shock.

“These flames... are so terrifying!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

It was indeed terrifying. Although he did not personally feel the power of the purple-black flames, he could vaguely feel that the purple-black flames had the power to burn down all living things.

“If I don’t have the strength of an Immortal Saint, I’m afraid I won’t be able to resist the flames. Even an Invincible Divine Master would die if he was trapped in the sea of flames for ten breaths.” Jian Wushuang sighed, then he looked at Lord Mo...

“Lord Mo, what are these flames?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This is the Earth Flame. Among all the natural flames in the divine beginning world, it’s just an ordinary one. But although it’s ordinary, it can accumulate temperature according to its existence. An ordinary Earth Flame that is tens of thousands of years old or hundreds of thousands of years old is not terrible, but an Earth Flame that is more than a million years old is very impressive.”

“But the Earth Flame you see now has existed for 30 million years!” Lord Mo said.

“30 million years of Earth Flame? No wonder.” Jian Wushuang secretly exclaimed.

“The reason why I chose to put my castle in this group of volcanoes is that there are all kinds of Earth Flame in the volcanoes. There are hundreds of thousands of years and millions of years of Earth Flame. The most important thing is the 30 million years of Earth Flame. This Earth Flame is definitely a dream for me, a blacksmith,” Lord Mo said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang also understood.

In the open space in front of them, the purple-black flames formed a huge sea of fire. The Holy Heaven Furnace, which had been standing quietly, turned red, and the aura it emitted became stronger and stronger. Finally... bang!

The huge lid of the furnace was thrown away, and the Holy Heaven Furnace rose up.
