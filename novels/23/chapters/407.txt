Chapter 408: The Same Ending?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Scenes of slaughter were seen throughout Flaming Battlefield.

Jian Wushuang and his teammates had been on the battlefield for half a month.

A magnificent blood river spread across the vast sky and cast a shadow over the entire area.

A squad of Marquis Cangyue experts was mired in the blood river.

Being heavily suppressed by the blood river, they were in a state of fright and shock.

“Haha, kill them all!”

Sir Axe growled a command and his people charged forward. Helped by the blood river, they had an advantage over their opponents.

The Marquis Cangyue squad could not escape as their mobility was curtailed under the influence of the Blood River.

A ferocious battle ensued, with the seven experts killed by Jian Wushuang and his comrades.

“This feels so good!” Sir Axe was delighted.

He looked over at Jian Wushuang. “Swordsman, your Realm Technique is really awesome!”

The other commanders shared his sentiments.

Over the past half month, they had encountered three squads from Marquis Cangyue.

For the first encounter, they had vanquished an enemy squad with the help of Realm Technique.

The second time, they had met a more powerful squad. Fighting had been intense and they had almost lost. Fortunately, the Realm Technique had enabled them to eventually draw with the hostile squad.

The third time, they had slaughtered the enemy squad they encountered.

Their success on the battlefield could be attributed to Jian Wushuang’s Blood River.

The powerful technique affected strength and speed, rendering their opponents helpless against their attacks. This made it easy to dispatch their opponents.

Sir Axe and the other six experts were ecstatic at their battle successes. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

While they were engaged with slaughtering the third squad, Jian Wushuang and his comrades were unaware that a black-robed woman had appeared on a barren mountain a distance away.

“Shadow, what’s up?” An elder with sword-shaped eyebrows looked over.

The black-robed woman belonged to a powerful squad. Two of its 10 members had reached the Peak of Stage Two.

“I left a mark on that magic weapon. Now I can feel it,” the black-robed woman said tonelessly.

“Oh?” the elder responded, eyes lighting up. “That means that the person I intentionally released has returned to Flaming Battlefield?”

“Yeah, I think so.” The black-robed woman nodded.

“It seems that we’ll be getting more battle achievements.” The elder smirked. He issued an order to an expert next to him. “Tell Wu Hong to bring his squad.”

“Yes.” The expert responded and left to deliver the message.

Half a day later, a squad of 10 experts arrived. They were led by a savage-looking man with unruly hair.

The elder smiled. “Wu Hong, my brother, we’ll make a bundle.”

“A bundle?” Wu Hong was surprised. “Is it the man whom we released?”

“Yes, it’s him.” The elder nodded with a smile. “When I let him go, I guessed that he would return. Just as I expected! This time, I’m sure he must have brought a squad with him...”

Wu Hong grinned. “Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s go right now.”

“No hurry. Shadow left a mark on them so they can’t escape us. We don’t need to rush,” the elder explained laughingly.

“You need to exercise caution. It hasn’t been peaceful in Outer Area recently. Many squads disappeared without a trace. They must have been killed by others. Don’t follow in their footsteps,” Shadow said with a frown.

“Our two squads are strong. Do we need to worry? Moreover, we’ve done this several times. It’ll be easy for us to manage.” The elder sneered.

The two squads, including three experts at the Peak of Stage Two, set off from the mountain. They headed toward Jian Wushuang and his comrades.

...

Jian Wushuang and his comrades slowly glided through the sky.

His comrades were in a celebratory mood as they had gained much over the past half month.

However, Jian Wushuang was ambivalent.

He had felt unchallenged during the fights.

He had come to the battlefield to test himself against experts at higher levels. In Outer Area, squads were usually comprised of Stage Two experts, who posed little threat to him.

Jian Wushuang was raring to enter Inner Area to fight with more powerful experts.

As Jian Wushuang was deep in contemplation, 10 black figures appeared on the horizon.

“Someone is coming.”

Zang Feng, who was leading the group, sounded a warning.

The others raised their heads to look. They were surprised to see the approaching figures in front of them. Soon, they realized that another 10 figures had appeared behind them.

“What?”

The sudden appearance of these people startled the group. Sir Axe stared at the leader of the approaching squad and was shocked when he realized who it was.

Zang Feng and Feng Zi were also dumbstruck.

“That’s them!”

Sir Axe, Zang Feng, and Feng Zi recognized the group.

Not long ago, before Jian Wushuang had arrived at Flaming Battlefield, their squad had encountered the same people in Outer Area.

Then, they had been surrounded by 20 people, making it impossible for them to escape.

Five of their teammates had been killed; three of them were lucky enough to escape.

But now...

The same people!

The same situation!

Would the outcome be the same?
