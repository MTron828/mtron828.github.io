Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the dark void at the border of Buddhist Demon Sea, Jian Wushuang who was fleeing finally stopped on a dark ground.

“I can’t continue to run anymore,” Jian Wushuang looked around himself. “It’s because I am at the border of Buddhist Demon Sea. It would be difficult to run into any Star Demon. But if I were to continue to run forward, there’s an eighty percent chance that I will run into one.

Star Demon… Star Demons in the Sixth Lair. Besides the Four-Horned Star Demons that were extremely rare and only lived in the dangerous place, almost nothing else could pose a threat to Jian Wushuang.

However, it was when Jian Wushuang was at his zenith. To Jian Wushuang then, even a crimson Three-Horned Star Demon was vital. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t dare to move around in the Sixth Lair then. It was most crucial for him to quickly recover his situation.

“My injury is too serious and my power has reached an all-time low. It will be impossible for me to recover in a short period of time. Plus, the Sixth Lair isn’t a place to recover,” Jian Wushuang muttered and immediately took out a token to send a message to Hall Master Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, Palace Master has already arrived in the Sixth Lair. I will send your location to him. He will be with you in no time. Besides, Hall Master Gu Xin has already escaped from Buddhist Demon Sea,” Hall Master Yuan replied.

“Palace Master came?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

From what he knew, the Master of Star Palace had always been meditating in seclusion. Plus, the meditation then seemed to be extremely important. Hence, even when Jian Wushuang had become a Hall Master and threw a banquet, the Master of Star Palace never appeared.

But then…

“Palace Master was already liberated from seclusion. The moment he found out that you were assassinated in Buddhist Demon Sea, he immediately rushed over,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang was touched.

“Jian Wushuang, just wait for a moment,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately sat down.

He flipped his hand and there were a bunch of elixirs in his hand. The elixirs were extremely precious. Even a Sir God would value them highly. However, Jian Wushuang ate all the elixirs as though he was eating beans. He took in more than ten of them in one go.

Then, he continued to treat his injury as he waited.

Very soon, a maroon figure got closer to Jian Wushuang.

The maroon figure belonged to King of Venomous Worms. He was connected to Jian Wushuang by heart and blood. They could feel the existence of one another.

Then, King of Venomous Worms immediately snuck into Jian Wushuang’s body.

“King of Venomous Worms, are you okay?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I got injured and I need some time to recover, but it’s nothing major,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief when he heard the news.

The time flew past. Jian Wushuang waited for ten days in silence. Then, the Master of Star Palace and Hall Master Gu Xin arrived.

When Jian Wushuang saw the Master of Star Palace and Hall Master Gu Xin, he was finally at ease.

“Jian Wushuang, your injury…” the Master of Star Palace squinted his eyes. He could feel that Jian Wushuang’s aura was extremely weak.

“I am badly injured, but I am alive,” Jian Wushuang smiled weakly.

“What happened in Buddhist Demon Sea? Where’s Lei Chao?” Hall Master Gu Xin asked. “Let’s talk about this when we return,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mm,” the Master of Star Palace nodded faintly. Then, the three of them returned to Lineage of Star.

Although Jian Wushuang was badly injured, he consumed some elixirs and recovered some divine power during the ten days when he was waiting for the Master of Star Palace and Hall Master Gu Xin. He could afford to simply fly.

With the Master of Star Palace escorting personally, the journey back was smooth. The three of them arrived in Lineage of Star very soon.

…

In the lair of Lineage of Star, in a lofty palace.

The Master of Star Palace was seated on the uppermost of the palace while Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin sat on their respective seats. As for Hall Master Nie Yun, he remained in the Fifth Lair and never came out.

In the lofty palace then, it was dead silent. The four experts looked at the dead body in the middle of the hall and their faces looked icy.

The dead body was naturally Lei Chao’s.

“Lei Chao, I killed him myself,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was deep and there was pain in his eyes.

The three of them heard him but never intended to reprimand Jian Wushuang.

“I also know about soul control technique. Once a person is soul controlled, they don’t stand a chance to shake it off. It basically means the person is dead. With you killing him, it is simply giving him a true relief. If I were you, I would have done the same,” the Master of Star Palace said.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin nodded solemnly.

Lei Chao was an expert of Lineage of Star. Before Jian Wushuang rose up, he was the number one among Real Gods in Lineage of Star. They shared a great relationship.

Lei Chao had died and they were all in pain. However, if they were Jian Wushuang, they definitely would do that same as Jian Wushuang to give Lei Chao relief.

“Bury him. To outsiders, tell them that he ran into danger and accidentally fallen when he wandered in the Sixth Lair,” the Master of Star Palace said.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded and he waved to keep Lei Chao’s body into Qian Kun ring.

Everyone reined in their agony and the Master of Star Palace looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, tell us what happened in Buddhist Demon Sea,” the Master of Star Palace said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded, then he started telling the ins and outs of the story.

He didn’t hide anything about his experience in Buddhist Demon Sea. He talked about everything that he should.

From the beginning when he had first arrived at the triangle island where Lei Chao was, to the first killer move he encountered, which was the assassination carried out by the ugly looking lady. He also shared his judgment.

When they heard of the first and second killer moves that Acheron Palace had prepared, the three of them still remained calm.

However, the moment they found out about Acheron Palace’s third move, Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin stood on their feet.

“The five powerful Sir Gods teamed up and set up the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts?” Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin’s eyes were wide.

They knew about the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts too and it was set up by five Sir Gods. Under normal circumstances, anyone lower than an Emperor God stood almost no chance to stay alive.

However, Jian Wushuang had forcefully dissolved the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts and killed one of them?

Such power… Even the top Sir God wouldn’t be able to do that.

“After I broke the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts and killed Lei Chao, I met another person. The person was the fourth killer move that Acheron Palace prepared for me,” Jian Wushuang continued, “He was in a crimson robe and he was using a crimson trident. He was already in the realm of Emperor God!”

“Emperor God?”

Then, even the Master of Star Palace looked shocked.

“An Emperor God using a crimson trident?”

“It’s Emperor God Xue Gu!!!”

The Master of Star Palace pounded the table and stood up in anger. There was murderous intention in his eyes.

As for Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin, they were terrified and they were also raging with anger!!
