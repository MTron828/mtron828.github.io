Chapter 3007: Golden Cicada Shedding Its Shell!

——

“Run, everyone, run!”

The golden-robed young man also looked panicked. He kept screaming, and no one around him noticed him.

This was normal. After all, the Golden Mountain Sect was a very powerful sect in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Its sect master was a rank three True Saint, and there were too many powerful disciples under him. It was impossible for all the powerful disciples to know each other, moreover, the aura emitted by the young man with the gold token was only at the Divine Master level.

In this riot, of course, he would not attract attention.

He shouted and fled. Soon, he and his people escaped from the Golden Mountain Sect and fled into the void not far away.

In the Golden Mountain Sect, Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, was still wreaking havoc with his cold and dark aura.

He kept waving the blood sword in his hand, which also emitted a brilliant blood-red sword light. However, the power of the blood-red sword light was not very strong. At least, in the eyes of the Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect, it was not very strong, it could even be said to be very weak.

“What’s going on? How come the power of his swordsmanship has been weakened so much?”

“What’s wrong with this guy?”

“No matter what, let’s stay away from him. We just need to ask the disciples of the Golden Mountain Sect to leave and wait for the Sect Master to arrive.”

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect stood in the void not far away and looked at Jian Wushuang who was in a frenzy. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Previously, when Jian Wushuang broke the formation and fought them head-on, although it was only a short fight, Jian Wushuang’s strength had frightened them.

Because of this, several Immortal Saints had died. Now, although Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was much weaker than before, they still did not dare to act rashly.

Time passed.

After a long while, the Golden Mountain Sect Master finally arrived in person.

Before he arrived at the Golden Mountain Sect, Jian Wushuang still did not stop destroying it. Almost the entire Golden Mountain Sect had been destroyed by him.

However, the expert disciples of the Golden Mountain Sect had already fled far away.

“Sect Master!”

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect all looked at Sect Master.

Sect Master Golden Mountain looked down at the Golden Mountain Sect and saw the concrete corpse lying on the ground. He could not help but curse, “Bastard, I will tear you into pieces today!”

Without any hesitation, the Golden Mountain Sect Master made his move.

Because he knew Jian Wushuang’s battle record and that Jian Wushuang had killed both Tian Mound King and Stone Saint in one move, even the Golden Mountain Sect Master did not dare to be careless. As soon as he made his move, he went all out.

Rumble…

A majestic power gathered on the Golden Mountain Sect Master’s body.

Before the Sect Master of the Gold Mountain Sect arrived, the terrifying power had already formed waves of airwaves and rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

However, under the impact of the airwaves, an unbelievable scene appeared.

Under the impact of the airwaves, Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, began to collapse at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Yes, he collapsed.

It was obvious that he could not withstand the blast and collapsed directly.

“What?” Sect Master Jin Shan was stunned.

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect were also stunned.

Previously, Jian Wushuang could easily kill them with one sword and one person. He was terrifyingly strong. Even if he was not as strong as Sect Master Jin Shan, he was not much weaker.

But now, before the attack of Golden Mountain Sect Master arrived, he could not block the airwave formed by divine power?

How could this be?

Golden Mountain Sect Master moved forward and grabbed the head of the gray-masked man like a golden lightning bolt. With a slight force, the man’s head exploded and the mask fell off, a cold and stiff face was revealed.

“This is…a corpse puppet?” Sect Master Jin Shan’s pupils shrank.

He could tell at a glance that the person he killed was actually already dead. He had just been refined into a corpse puppet.

“I’ve been played!”

Sect Master Jin Shan immediately reacted, but he was furious.

“It’s actually a corpse puppet!”

“No, it wasn’t a corpse puppet that killed the four of us in an instant!”

“Oh right, after he rushed down and defeated us head-on, he barged into a palace. At that time, he left our sight. Yes, that was the time…”

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect is also completely understood.

Obviously, when the other party entered the hall and disappeared from their sight for a short period of time, the other party had already put on a disguise. He made a corpse puppet wear the unique attire of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, which was a gray robe and a gray mask, then, he wreaked havoc in the Golden Mountain Sect.

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect had been scared out of their wits because they had been killed by four people in the previous fight. They did not dare to fight with this corpse puppet at all. Even though they could see that the sword technique used by this corpse puppet was very weak, they still did not dare…they were still waiting for the arrival of the Sect Master of the Golden Mountain Sect.

However, after the Sect Master of the Golden Mountain Sect arrived personally, the other party’s original body had already fled far away with the disciples of the Golden Mountain Sect.

“We’ve been fooled!”

“We’ve been fooled by that person!”

“We have so many Immortal Saints, but we were actually frightened by a corpse puppet, and it’s only a Divine Master-level corpse puppet.”

“Good, what a good escape!”

The Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect were all shocked and furious!

Their roars echoed in the whole world.

Master of the Golden Mountain Sect was also furious, but if he was angry again…he had lost track of Jian Wushuang, and no one knew where he was. It was almost impossible for him to chase after Jian Wushuang.

Taking a deep breath, the Golden Mountain Sect Master took out a token and said, “Lord Wu, that man…escaped!”

…

There was a void some distance away from the Golden Mountain Sect.

More than ten figures were gathered together. They were disciples who had just escaped from the Golden Mountain Sect.

“That was close!”

“That man was too terrifying. He destroyed the sect-protecting formation of our Golden Mountain Sect with one sword strike and killed four elders in a single move. Only our Sect Master could match such terrifying strength.”

“I guess so. Fortunately, this person was only one person. Although he was wreaking havoc, he didn’t have the intention to attack ordinary disciples like us. That’s how we were able to escape. Otherwise…if he really went on a killing spree, countless disciples like us would have died.”

These disciples sighed one after another.

The young man in the golden robe was also among these disciples.
