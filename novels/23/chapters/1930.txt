Jian Wushuang, Sword Emperor, the seventeenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He was second to Underworld God.

When it was announced, even Jian Wushuang was surprised. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

One should know that although he was powerful, it was a little forceful to say that he was second to Underworld God among Emperor Gods.

Forget about the others, Jian Yi and Emperor God Tian Ling were already stronger than him.

Plus, the boatman in black that Jian Wushuang had met on the way back from Emperor Sword Sect was also stronger than him.

“I’d like to see why the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance arranged themselves as such,” Jian Wushuang muttered and continued to read.

“Sword Emperor once performed a shocking stroke and killed over a hundred Almighties from Almighties Alliance. No one below Great Emperor rank could withstand the power of the one stroke. After the display of the shocking stroke, he was cornered by Abysmal Saint Master. At that crucial moment, he gave his all and launched a hit that could be compared favorably to a Great Emperor’s. His trump cards were impressive.”

“Plus, before he used any trump cards, he once fought against three Peak Emperor Gods alone and he had the upper hand. On top of that, he soul-controlled an expert with immeasurable skill, Jian Yi… With everything mentioned above, it is determined that Jian Wushuang’s overall power could challenge an Underworld God’s. The moment he launches his trump card, even Underworld God will have to move away.”

“Hence his ranking on the seventeenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!”

On the brand new Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, the reason why Jian Wushuang was on that ranking was listed clearly.

Hence, no one had the guts to doubt him.

Even, there were some who thought the higher-ups of Sanctuary Alliance had ranked Jian Wushuang too low.

He should be above Underworld God.

After all, even Underworld Gods had to avoid if they were to come across an Almighties Alliance that was made of over a hundred Almighties.

However, Jian Wushuang wielded his sword and killed everyone with one stroke.

The terrifying stoke made everyone yield.

Naturally, no one had any opinion about the ranking.

It was Jian Wushuang himself who felt sheepish.

Because he had performed the terrifying stroke by putting the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace to play all together. The third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace wasn’t easy to perform.

After performing it once, it would require a long time until he could perform it the second time.

Putting the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace aside, he reckoned his other trump cards wouldn’t enable him to match Underworld God evenly.

However, it wasn’t false that Jian Yi was soul controlled. Soul control was considered one of his skills as well. If he were to fight alongside Jian Yi, he might stand a chance to pose a threat to Underworld God.

After all, Jian Yi was an expert from ancient times. After he revealed his terrifying fighting power in Universe Galaxy, the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance had already listed him on the eighteenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!

Just below Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Yi, it was followed by Emperor God Tian Ling!

That was normal. Those who partook in that way knew that Emperor God Tian Ling gave his all when he had fought with Jian Yi, but in the end, Jian Yi had the upper hand.

It was obvious that Jian Yi was slightly stronger than Emperor God Tian Ling.

The ranking among the top few Peak Emperor Gods changed and the ranking of the other Peak Emperor Gods and ordinary Emperor Gods was even higher.

However, Jian Wushuang merely went through it simply but didn’t bother much.

He broke seven stars in the earlier battle and the power of ancient tribe bloodline was exhausted. He would require time to slowly recover.

“King of Venomous Worms, for the rest of this time, I’ll have to depend on you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I’ll try my best,” King of Venomous Worms replied.

The current King of Venomous Worms found it hard to assist Jian Wushuang in fighting his enemies on the level of Peak Emperor God. However, his recovery power had still played a major factor.

His recovery power was Jian Wushuang’s biggest reliance.

…

In boundless darkness, in the void that had no light, there was a dark palace floating.

In the depth of the dark palace, on a lofty throne, there was a figure in a black robe that slowly appeared.

The figure in the black robe had a pale face and his aura was spiritless. It was Abysmal Saint Master.

There was armor floating in front of Abysmal Saint Master. However, it was obvious that the armor was forcefully put together by shattered pieces.

“No way, forget about putting them back together, even if I were to refine it entirely, the power of the amor would be diminished greatly. D*mn it!!!” Abysmal Saint Master clenched his hand and there was billowing hatred in his eyes.

He had paid a great price to get the armor from ancient mystery land but it had broken apart straight away.

“Emperor Thirteen!”

“D*mn Emperor Thirteen!!”

“Just you wait. I can’t do anything about you now, but it is only a matter of time until I peel your skin and break your bones. I’ll let you know that letting me go is a great mistake!”

“Not only you, but also Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang. One day, I will step on all of you!”

“I definitely will!!!”

Abysmal Saint Master roared in madness. As his bellow spread, there were a few flames that soared into the air in darkness.

…

In the huge estate that looked like a human paradise.

On the calm river, a boat was drifting casually. On the boat, there was a lazy man in a purple robe fishing with his bamboo rod. At the same time, he was listening to the report of a beautiful woman in a purple robe behind him.

“Master, this is news from Lineage of Star,” the beautiful woman in a purple robe said politely.

“They are defeated?” The lazy man looked surprised, “Abysmal took action himself but didn’t get to kill Jian Wushuang?! Abysmal is such rubbish.”

“It wasn’t because Abysmal Saint Master was not powerful. The crucial part is that a mysterious expert, Emperor Thirteen, helped Jian Wushuang and he was too powerful. Abysmal Saint Master couldn’t even take one stroke. Even when Emperor Bai attacked, he didn’t manage to score before the mysterious expert. If I’m not mistaken, Emperor Thirteen should be an expert from ancient times,” the beautiful woman in the purple robe said.

“An expert from ancient times?” The lazy man was surprised. “As it involves ancient times, it isn’t something I can take care of. Report this to Demon King. He might know the origins of Emperor Thirteen.”

Then, the lazy man continued to fish.

The beautiful woman in the purple robe nodded and disappeared from the boat.

...

In the darkest place in Eternal Chaotic World.

Gugu. There was a large amount of black river water that covered the entire universe. The river was like the netherland. The black river water was like the water in the netherland.

This was the core of Acheron Palace.

In the middle of the boundless netherworld, there was a floating island and there was a pavilion towering on the island.

In the depths, there was a pitch-black tower.

The tower was huge but there was only one level.
