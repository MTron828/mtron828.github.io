Chapter 2163 Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds

At the Imperial City, once Emperor Bai and the rest were informed of the Three Emperors World experts’ hiding spot, they made their preparations.Within two days, the Eternal Chaotic World army gathered once again.

They headed straight for the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds.

Kaiser Blood, located at the deepest part of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds, was the first to sense the entry of the army.

“The Eternal Chaotic World army is here,” Kaiser Blood said.

“They managed to find us in the end?” Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu were not surprised, however.

They knew even though the Ancient Blood Tribe and its Ancient Blood Emperor were extremely formidable, they were not allies with the Three Emperors World at the end of the day. It would be wishful thinking to assume the tribe would block Jian Wushuang for them.

The army would eventually make its way towards the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

It was simply faster than they had imagined.

“Kaiser Blood, how are your preparations going?” Lord Fen looked over.

“It’s almost done. We simply need to sacrifice the items mentioned in the plan, and it’ll be done,” Kaiser Blood said coldly.

Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Leng Ruxue’s eyes drooped.

They knew what needed to be sacrificed.

“We have no choice, this is for our final objective,” Kaiser Blood said coldly. “Go, make your preparations. The Eternal Chaotic World’s army will arrive soon.”

Under the dark Void was Kaiser Blood, sitting.

He had a grin on his face, a grin so sinister that anyone that caught their eyes on it would feel shivers down their spine.

“Hehe, the plan I’ve crafted for years is finally beginning!”

The Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds were dangerous, but actually the only dangerous part of it was the Ancient Blood Tribe.

But after the Ancient Blood Emperor’s compromise, providing Jian Wushuang safe passage towards the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, the Eternal Chaotic World army did not encounter any danger along the way, and swiftly arrived at its destination.

“The Three Emperors World experts are hiding here?”

Countless Eternal Chaotic World experts had their eyes glued on the domain covered by a formation.

Even with the formation’s blockade, they could still feel a thick aura coming from within.

Without a doubt, there were many experts hiding inside.

“Who would have thought they would hide at the top forbidden ground of the Three Emperors World,” Abysmal Saint Master sneered.

“Luckily the Sword Emperor was able to convince the Ancient Blood Tribe to step back, if not it would have been extremely difficult for our troops to enter here,” Red Dragon King laughed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The surrounding Great Emperors all looked towards Jian Wushuang in admiration.

After countless battles, Jian Wushuang’s status within the Eternal Chaotic World had risen to the very top.

The Great Emperors were all sincerely convinced.

“Everyone, although we have found their hiding spot, we must remain vigilant,” Jian Wushuang said. “The Three Emperors World’s forces are no weaker than ours. Even though we scored a major victory at the Imperial City, they still have many experts and more.”

“They were unprepared the previous time. But now will be different. It will be a tough fight for us.” Hearing this, the surrounding Great Emperors all nodded, their faces ever so serious.

Even though they had destroyed the Three Emperors World forces in the previous battle, they dared not let their guard down.

The battle was too important.

If they lost, the Eternal Chaotic World would be finished.

“According to what I know, the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds has a Space Tunnel linking to outside domains. The Three Emperors World experts have definitely sensed our arrival, yet they have not left. From the looks of it, they wish for a final battle against us here,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“The Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds has been under the Three Emperors World for the longest period of time. With the added formation… the grounds are not in our favour. But at this juncture, it is impossible for the Three Emperors World forces to initiate the fight. In order to secure a victory, we need to wipe out their entire forces once and for all,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“If that is the case, let us fight!” Emperor Bai’s voice sent out chills. “Send the message, attack head-on, and destroy the formation!”

Soon Soul Power surrounded the entire Eternal Chaotic World army.

In an instant, the many experts, Great Emperors included, made their move.

Waves and waves of powerful attacks, though not amplified with special formations, attacked in the same direction.

Hong!

A terrifying howl was let out.

Within the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, the Three Emperors World experts had already gathered the moment the Eternal Chaotic World army had arrived.

The Three Emperors World forces were originally no weaker than the Eternal Chaotic World.

But after the battle at the Three Emperors World, along with the raid on the Three Emperors World, they had suffered heavy losses.

The experts that had gathered at the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds totalled no more than three thousand.

Less than three thousand Sir God and Emperor Gods.

There were only twenty-odd Great Emperors.

Their strengths could not be compared to the Eternal Chaotic World forces.

Hong!

As the terrifying howl was let out, the Three Emperors World experts’ faces turned serious.

“Have they started attacking the formation?” Kaiser Blood stood at the top and watched the formation shake in front of his eyes.

“The elixirs I gave you all, consume them now.”
