Chapter 1781: Going Back To Take A Look

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the Lineage of Star, someone sent a message to Jian Wushuang the moment he came out of the Star Palace Master’s cave.

The person who sent him a message was King Gu Tong!

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you have already gotten into the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list of the human territories? Congratulations,” King Gu Tong said.

Human territories and the territories of special clans were completely separated.

For example, the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list of the human territories only had human experts in it. As for the experts of the special clans, they were not in it.

Of course, the most important thing was that there were very few interactions between human territories and the territories of special clans.

King Gu Tong was a Seven-star Royal Ancient God and was a person who was highly respected. Hence, he had some knowledge regarding the human territories. Naturally, he knew about the matter where Jian Wushuang had gotten into the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

“King Gu Tong, what is the progress of the recovery of your abilities?” Jian Wushuang replied with a laugh. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Comparing abilities, his current abilities were stronger than those of King Gu Tong. Thus, he could naturally communicate with King Gu Tong on equal footing.

“I have more or less recovered. Moreover, after a short while, I will be going for Eight-star Ancient God,” King Gu Tong said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

An Eight-star Ancient God was equivalent to the level of a human Emperor God. Furthermore, King Gu Tong was a Royal Ancient God. As soon as he made a breakthrough, his abilities would be out of the ordinary.

“Congratulations,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Let’s not talk about that now. I have contacted you because of a certain matter,” King Gu Tong’s voice turned serious, “Since you are already one of the top experts of the human territories, you should know about the news of the Ancient Mystery Land appearing soon, right?”

“Yes, I just got to know it,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“The Ancient Mystery Land has a huge implication. To special clans like us, it is extremely attractive. Hence, some of the experts of my Ancient God Clan, as well as a few other top special clans, will be going there to travel. Moreover, back then, I told you that the space crack that leads to the battlefield that your hometown is at is in the Ancient Mystery Land,” King Gu Tong said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes and expression turned grave immediately.

When he had encountered King Gu Tong in the Ancient God Sanctuary in the past, he got to know that King Gu Tong had gone to the battlefield that his hometown was at via the space crack of a special mystery land.

“King Gu Tong has said before that the space crack is extremely well hidden. Back then, he found it by chance. Apart from him, no one else in the whole Eternal Chaotic World should know about the existence of that space crack. However… now that the Ancient Mystery Land is about to open, there is no guarantee that the space crack will not be found by someone,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The space crack was a huge hidden trouble.

If someone were to find it and spread the news of it, a great number of experts would definitely rush to the battlefield that his hometown was at. By then, it would be extremely troublesome.

“Jian Wushuang, I am merely telling you this so that you can take some precautions. However, you need not worry. After so many years, the Ancient Mystery Land has opened so many times. In the end, I am the only person who has gone to the mystery land where your hometown is before. Even if other people wanted to go, they might not be so lucky as to come across it by chance,” King Gu Tong said.

“Alright, thank you very much for telling me this,” Jian Wushuang thanked him and cut the transmission.

In the Milky Way, Jian Wushuang heaved a light sigh of relief.

“I hope no one discovers the existence of the space crack when the Ancient Mystery Land opens this time around. If they were to really find it by accident, a great number of experts will descend upon the battlefield in my hometown. By then, I would at most give away all the resources of the battlefield. It will be alright as long as I can keep the Green Fire World,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly. He had made up his mind.

After knowing that, Jian Wushuang did not delay any further and he made preparations to return to his hometown right away.

However, this time around, Jian Wushuang did not plan to return alone.

…

In a star in the boundless Milky Way.

The star was a huge, open space and it was used especially for duels.

At that moment, two figures were fighting one another in the open space.

One of them was holding a giant axe with both his hands. Towering axe shadows were being unleashed in succession and they were like tidewater which came forth in a steady flow.

The towering axe shadows filled the universe and caused many disciples who were observing the battle by the side to exclaim in admiration.

However, while facing the axe shadows which were heading toward him, the young man who held a sword in his heads unleashed many strokes one by one randomly. Although it looked simple and random, he managed to block all the axe shadows easily. Moreover, the sword essences had forced his opponent into an unusually miserable state.

After just a short while, the disciple holding the giant axe was defeated.

“You have lost,” He Xiu’s voice was cold and he wore an indifferent smile.

As for the disciple who he had defeated, he forced a smile. He had already given his all by unleashing all his tricks. However, he had still been defeated by He Xiu easily.

“Too strong. Senior Brother He Xiu is really too strong!”

“Among Universe Gods of the Third Heaven like us, Senior Brother Bai Hao is considered one of the top three. Similarly, he has the right to get into the Universe God ranking list. However, in Senior Brother He Xiu’s hands, there is no room for him to struggle at all. When Senior Brother He Xiu fought with him, he defeated him easily without even unleashing his Unique Skills and Sword Principles.”

“These are the fighting capabilities of the top ten on the Universe God ranking list!”

“No wonder countless Hall Masters valued him highly and he was accepted as a Registered Disciple. Currently, no one among the disciples of the Lineage of Star is more talented than Senior Brother He Xiu.”

“Registered Disciple? Why have I heard that he is a Lineal Disciple?”

Many disciples in the star were having a discussion.

As for He Xiu, he was not concerned with those comments and he was about to leave. All of a sudden, a message was sent to him.

“Master is looking for me?” He Xiu’s expression changed and he headed to the Sword Star without hesitation.

In a vast hall in the Sword Star.

Jian Wushuang was sitting on the throne which was at the highest point. Although he was not emitting any aura, the invisible pressure that he exerted was still enough to make Chaotic Real Gods shiver with fear.

In the big hall, Qiu Yue, who had already become a Real God and had gotten herself established among the Void Real Gods, was standing quietly. In no time, a shadow rushed over.

“Greetings to Master,” He Xiu bowed respectfully.

“You may get up,” Jian Wushuang waved his hands and He Xiu got up right away.

“I heard that you got into the ninth position of the Universe God ranking list three hundred years ago?” Jian Wushuang was looking down at his disciple.

“That’s right,” He Xiu answered, “However, that was three hundred years ago. For the past three hundred years, with the aid of the Real God Hall, my abilities have risen considerably. Hence, I am confident that I can get into the top five of the Universe God ranking list now.”

“Oh, not bad,” Jian Wushuang praised him and nodded his head.

With regards to his disciple He Xiu, who he had accepted in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, Jian Wushuang was quite satisfied.

In particular, for the past seven thousand years, ever since he had come to the Lineage of Star, he had improved greatly. He was already the number one among the disciples of the Lineage of Star. Moreover, he was ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list and he had a great reputation in the Eternal Chaotic World.
