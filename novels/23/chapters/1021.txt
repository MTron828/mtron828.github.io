Chapter 1022: There is No Escape!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

I’ve used my best hit, but still haven’t defeated you. Instead, you had a breakthrough. Now that you are even stronger, I do not have the ability to kill you,” said Dao Master Dreamless as he drew back his long spear, resigned.

Jian Wushuang gave a wry smile.

In creating the third Sword Principle, which was at the Universe Level he had greatly strengthened himself in offensive power. He would be almost unparalleled in skill. Now, Dao Master Dreamless wouldn’t even be able to hold him off, let alone kill him.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Dao Master Dreamless tossed a token in his direction.

Though hesitant, he reached out to catch to the token in his hands.

The moment it touched his hand, a voice echoed through his mind.

“Jian Wushuang, we, the Samsara Temple, know that 20 years ago, Jin Yu attacked you first, and you only killed him in defense. You didn’t mean to provoke us.” Dao Master Dreamless’s mouth did not move as his message was sent through the token. He clearly wanted a private conversation with Jian Wushuang.

“To be completely transparent, I did not come with the intention of killing you. We only wanted to teach you a lesson since you killed a Gold-clothed Deacon. We couldn’t just let you get away with it.

“We didn’t want to kill you because you have great potential. Perhaps you can join the Green Fire Palace and serve as our soldier. We won’t kill a prodigy like you unless absolutely necessary.

“When I said I wanted to kill you on the spot, I was merely attempting to provoke you into using your full strength. Please forgive me if I’ve been rude.”

Dao Master Dreamless sounded sincere. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The order he received was simply to teach Jian Wushuang a lesson, not to kill him.

The Samsara Temple know about Jian Wushuang’s overwhelming defensive power, so if they really wanted to kill him, they would have sent a Celestial Master instead of the Dao Master.

Not even Dao Master Dreamless expected that after using his full strength he would fail to even scratch Jian Wushuang. On the contrary, he had incited Jian Wushuang’s discovery of his third Sword Principle.

Now that Jian Wushuang had gained so much power, there was no point in continuing to fight, thus he had clarified his intentions and apologized to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was shocked at the Dao Master’s words.

He though that the Samsara Temple wanted to kill him, but it was far from the truth.

Did Samsara Temple really only want to teach him a lesson as a punishment?

“The Green Fire Palace?”?Jian Wushuang was curious.

It was not the first time he had heard of it. During the time that the royal palace of Tang of the East was besieged by three larger countries, the Tang Emperor nearly killed the other ruler, however since the ruler was from the Green Fire Palace, the Tang Emperor had to spare him.

For the second time, Jian Wushuang failed to discover what the Green Fire Palace was.

Restraining his curiosity, Jian Wushuang refrained from asking about the Palace.

“Dao Master, since you don’t intend to kill me, then the Black Python Clan…” Jian Wushuang sent back a message through the token.

“We do not interfere with the business of the Black Python Clan, so you may do as you please,” Dao Master Dreamless said.

“Thank you for your permission.” Jian Wushunage let out a smile as sharp as the edge of his blade.

The crowd could not hear a single word of their conversation through the token.

However, the battle they had witnessed was still at the forefront of their thoughts.

“How is this possible?”

“Dao Master Dreamless performed a strike at Celestial Master level. How did he fail to kill Jian Wushuang?”

“And how did Jian Wushuang discover his Sword Principle instead?”

“What happened?”

Di Yan, Mo Lin, and many other experts from the Black Python Clan were all baffled.

Di Yan was trembling.

Before this battle, Jian Wushuang could already him in terms of battle strength. But now, after Jian Wushuang successfully devised his third Sword Principle, he would be able to kill him easily.

“Mo Lin, let’s go!” Di Yan whispered.

Mo Lin was reluctant to lose this chance, but he had to leave. Since they were no longer able to kill Jian Wushuang, the only option was to leave with the rest of the Black Python Clan.

Except just as they turned around, they heard a voice call out.

“You’ve really made yourselves at home haven’t you?”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice reverberated across the sky.

Di Yan, Mo Lin, and other Black Python Clan experts all stopped in their tracks and turned to regard Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, we’re already about to leave, what do you want form us? Do you want us to stay forever?” Di Yan questioned Jian Wushuang angrily.

“Yes, in fact, I do.” Jian Wushuang smiled quietly.

“Interesting.” Di Yan snorted. “I admit that since you’ve broken through, you are now more capable than me. But so what? I’m fast. I can outrun you easily. If you want me to stay forever, make me!”

Di Yan taunted.

Both he and Mo Lin knew they could not match Jian Wushuang in terms of brute force. However, they both believed that they could outrun him easily.

“You’re right, Di Yan. Under normal circumstances, I can’t outrun you. But look around yourself now.” The severity of Jian Wushuang’s voice sent a tremor through the listeners. At his own words, he secretly commanded his Slaughter Body.

No one had discovered that his Slaughter Body set up Dragon-trapping Spell Formation in secret.

The Spell Formation was complete and awaiting his signal.

At his signal, his Slaughter Body activated the Spell Formation at once.

All of a sudden, a transparent shield wove together to cover the nearby Void in its entirety.

Jian Wushuang, Di Yan, Mo Lin, and the other experts were all trapped.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s expression spoke death.

“There is no escape for anyone today!”
