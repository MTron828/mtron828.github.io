Chapter 755: The Revenge of the Cloud Sea Asgard

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When Jian Wushuang blocked Yun Fan, Palace Master Destruction, Palace Master Mo Tao, and Palace Master Ming Xin had seized the opportunity and fled without stopping.

A series of blasts had sounded from behind, keeping them in constant terror.

The did not breathe a sigh of relief until they had escaped far from the battlefield and met Baiyu and Ling Yu, who had also detected the emergency signal and hurried to help.

On a rather deserted hill, the five Eternal Realm experts of the Ancient Sect gathered together.

“Destruction, what on earth happened? What made you send the emergency signal?”

Palace Master Destruction’s face went somber. “It was because of Yun Fan!”

“Yun Fan?” Baiyu and Ling Yu were both taken aback.

“At first, the three of us were pretty lucky. We snatched up a Baptismal Pool from the Demon Gods. But as soon as we got it, we bumped into Yun Fan, who happened to be passing by, and two other experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard.” Palace Master Destruction started to recount the whole story.

“They’re all human beings as we are. So even though Yun Fan felt jealous about us obtaining the Baptismal Pool, he should have restrained his temper a bit. But to our surprise, the old bastard launched a direct strike against us.”

At this point, Palace Master Destruction, Palace Master Mo Tao, and Palace Master Ming Xin looked highly infuriated.

“The three of us naturally found this outrageous and tried our best to fight back. But Yun Fan has concealed his strength for so many years, he must have brought his strength to a higher level in secret. By my calculation, his present battle strength rivals someone at Step Four of the Eternal Realm,” Palace Master Destruction said.

“Step Four?” Baiyu and Ling Yu were shocked.

“He turned into a Silver-armored Demon God and totally subdued us all by himself,” Palace Master Destruction went on. “We could only flee in a haste, but he didn’t give up and kept chasing after us.”

“We thought he was coming for the Baptismal Pool. Since he was so desperate to get the thing, to save our lives, I proposed that he could have the Baptismal Pool in exchange for our safety. But to everyone’s shock, he refused!”

“Refused?” Palace Master Baiyu’s expression altered. “You promised him the Baptismal Pool of the Demon Gods, how could he turn you down?”

“Who knows?” Destruction shook his head.

“That guy was crazy! He just wanted the three of us dead.” Palace Master Mo Tao cursed under his breath. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We were being chased and were running out of solutions. So, we had to send the emergency signal and ask for help,” Palace Master Destruction said helplessly.

When he finished, Palace Master Baiyu and Vice Palace Master Ling Yu both turned quite solemn.?

The three had been willing to give him the Baptismal Pool of Demon Gods, yet he still didn’t let them off the hook. It seemed that he was really going to kill Palace Master Destruction and the other two.

“We then asked ourselves whether Yun Fan held some personal grudge against us. Judging by his behavior, it’s obvious that he wants to have a go at our Ancient Sect. If nothing else, I reckon it’s because a hundred years ago Palace Master Xuan Yi killed seven Eternal Realm experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard. I bet that ever since, the Cloud Sea Asgard has been bearing a grudge against our Ancient Sect. And this was why Yu Fan vented his anger on us.”

“What a jerk! Isn’t he afraid of provoking the entire Ancient Sect?” Baiyu swore.

“No, he isn’t.” Vice Palace Master Ling Yu suddenly spoke.

Palace Master Destruction and the other two immediately turned to look at him.

Ling Yu continued with a note of seriousness, “Everybody, as you know, although our Ancient Sect is a very special sect in the Firmament Territory, sometimes we still have to look out for the three magnates. To be honest, the overall strength of our Ancient Sect is not that remarkable, nor is our history or foundation. All we have are our Sect Master and Palace Master Xuan Yi!”

“Now, in terms of the three magnates, the strength of any of them is way above our Ancient Sect. They have no fear for our Ancient Sect or our Eternal Realm experts. They really only care about our Sect Master and Palace Master Xuan Yi.”

“However, our Sect Master always acts in secret. It’s been years since he revealed himself before us. We don’t even know if he is still in the Firmament Territory or not!”

“As for Palace Master Xuan Yi, well, you all know his temper. He has his own style. As long as others don’t offend him to an unbearable extent, such as killing his top disciples, his close relatives, or putting the Ancient Sect in a life-threatening crisis, he won’t strike back.”

“Precisely for this reason, Yun Fan has no scruples in attacking you guys.”

“A hundred years ago, it was Palace Master Xuan Yi who killed seven Eternal Realm experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard, causing them to suffer a great loss. But they don’t dare get back at Palace Master Xuan Yi, so they can only attack our experts as revenge.”

After hearing Vice Palace Master Ling Yu out, Palace Master Destruction and his lot nodded in agreement.

They all sincerely approved of what Vice Palace Master Ling Yu had just said.

Indeed, the only ones in the Ancient Sect that could really frighten the three magnates were their Sect Master, who was titled as the top expert in the Firmament Territory; and Palace Master Xuan Yi, who was famous for his mysterious but formidable power.

Other than these two, the three magnates never took other experts seriously.

Accordingly, it was only normal for the three magnates to retaliate against them instead of Xuan Yi.

“Seems that in the next few days we have to be more cautious,” Palace Master Destruction exclaimed.

The other Palace Masters nodded in agreement.

“By the way, Destruction,” Palace Master Baiyu looked back. “You said you were in such a dangerous situation. But how on earth did you escape from Yun Fan?”

“Er…”

The three Palace Masters exchanged embarrassed looks. Their expressions became a bit odd.

“Here’s the thing.”

Palace Master Destruction started to explain, “When we were running away, we came across a Gold-armored Demon God with horrible strength. This Gold-armored Demon God was only at the One-star Level, but his battle strength was just as great as Yun Fan’s. And the most important thing is that he showed no interest in us at all.”

“No interest?” Palace Master Baiyu was a bit startled.

“Yes, he was not interested.” Palace Master Ming Xin nodded as well. “He was right in front of us. But when he came near, he just went past, didn’t even shoot a glance at us. He didn’t attack, either. Instead, he got into a fight with Yun Fan. Thanks to him barring Yun Fan’s way, we finally got a chance to run away.”

“Really?” The other two Palace Masters found this a bit fishy.

How could a Demon God have no interest in the three experts?

“Actually there is another thing…” Palace Master Destruction spoke suddenly. His brows furrowed slightly.

“What is it?” The other Palace Masters all turned to look at him.

“When the Gold-armored Demon God was battling with Yun Fan, I observed the sword he was using. The sword appeared to be, be…?the Emperor Sword!” Palace Master Destruction grunted.

“What?!”

Palace Master Mo Tao, Palace Master Baiyu, and the rest were all astonished at these words.

The Emperor Sword?

The one Palace Master Xuan Yi had made? The one that belonged to the successor of the Sword Palace?
