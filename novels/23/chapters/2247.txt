Chapter 2248 Attack

When Jian Wushuang attacked, the devilish teenager was angered.The devilish teenager did not want to fight Jian Wushuang as he could derive no sense of satisfaction at all. After all, he was not allowed to kill Jian Wushuang.

If Jian Wushuang stood there, the devilish teenager would not be willing to do anything at all.

He never thought that Jian Wushuang would initiate an attack.

“Die!”

He roared as divine power surged in the devilish teenager’s right hand. He then slapped towards the sword light made by Jian Wushuang.

He thought that he could destroy the sword light and teach Jian Wushuang a lesson even though he did not use his full power.

In reality...

Pfft!

When the seemingly feeble sword collided with his palm, the blade sliced through his hand and his palm was sliced off.

“What?” The devilish teenager’s eyes widened in surprise. He realised something was wrong. The sword did not stop after slicing his hand off. It was headed for his head.

Even though the sword seemed to travel slowly, it was too fast for the devilish teenager.

It was so fast that he could not do anything to protect himself.

Pfft!

His head was sliced off.

The experts in the Divine Demon Realm who were watching the battle were stunned.

“How can this be?”

“One sword... He killed Zi Xi with a single stroke?”

“The Sword Emperor...”

The experts in the Divine Demon Realm raised their heads and looked at Jian Wushuang in awe.

The fighting power of the devilish teenager was considered average within the whole group, but even Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi could not have killed him with a single stroke.

The Sword Emperor could not be an ordinary stage three great emperor.

They did not know that Jian Wushuang was far stronger than before.

There had been a gigantic leap in his fighting power.

Jian Wushuang had never used his full power after he became much stronger. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

During the battle at the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, he had only used a portion of his full fighting power. However, his true fighting power had not been made known to the rest of the experts from the ancient past as two out of the three experts from the ancient past had died in that battle, and the last expert was soul controlled by Jian Wushuang.

They thought that Jian Wushuang’s fighting power had not changed much since the great war against the Three Emperors World around twenty thousand years ago.

What they didn’t know was Jian Wushuang’s fighting power had reached another level.

Now, Jian Wushuang had finally used his full power.

“I did advise all of you to leave. None of you did.”

“Since all of you do not want to leave, then stay, forever.”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, his voice boiled with killing intent as it reverberated throughout the battlefield.

He attacked once he finished his sentence.

“Watch out!”

“So fast, this is Spacetime Rules of Order!”

The experts in Divine Demon Realm became cautious.

Whoosh!

His figure flashed as Jian Wushuang reappeared.

An expert in the Divine Demon Realm stood in that space. It was Divine Demon Xian Meng who was trying to find a way to break the formation.

“Oh no!”

When Jian Wushuang appeared, Meng Xian’s face turned pale.

He was about to turn around...

Right when he was about to turn, a cold sword light appeared.

This sword light was creepy and errantic. It appeared beside Xian Meng’s neck without any signs at all.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo... Turn Monstrous At One Thought.

Pfft!

The sword light passed and crimson red replaced it. Divine Demon Meng Xian died. He could not even put up a fight.

“Hiss~~~”

The remaining experts in the Divine Demon Realm all took a sharp breath.

It was too fast. Jian Wushuang was extremely fast, and his sword skill was even faster!

In the blink of an eye, two experts in the Divine Demon Realm had died at his hand.

“Work together and kill him,” Chu He ordered.

The five closest experts in the Divine Demon Realm attacked Jian Wushuang immediately.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the five experts in the Divine Demon Realm as he swung his sword.

This swing brought about a violent storm.

The entire heaven and earth started shaking as it threatened to collapse.

The five experts in Divine Demon Realm were like a small boat within a storm starting to be shaken violently.

Boom~~~

The battlefield shook as the five experts in the Divine Demon Realm flew back like a cannonball.

A single swing forced back five experts in the Divine Demon Realm.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s figure blurred.

Under the influence of the Spacetime Rules of Order, he was like a ghost.

The experts in the Divine Demon Realm found it difficult to track Jian Wushuang even when they used their soul power to do so.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of a well-built man.

This well-built man was one of the strongest men among the experts in the Divine Demon Realm as he had the fighting power of a top tier stage three great emperor even though he was under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

When Jian Wushuang appeared and slashed his sword at the man’s throat, the well-built man was not afraid as he drew his battle axe.

Right when he was about to use battle axe skills to force Jian Wushuang back, an attack appeared in his sea of consciousness.

Soul attack, Three Divine Lights, Golden Light Scripture!

Hum!!

The sea of consciousness of the well-built man was slammed hard as the man stood there, completely stunned.

The sword light from Jian Wushuang was not affected as it sliced through the well-built man’s throat.

His dead body then dropped towards the ground below.

“What?”

“Xiong Shi, Divine Demon Xiong Shi could not stop his sword?”

“It is a soul attack, beware of his soul attack!”

Angry shouts were heard as these experts in the Divine Demon Realm finally took Jian Wushuang seriously by using their full fighting power.

It was evident they had underestimated Jian Wushuang.

To be precise, they had underestimated his sword skills and the power of his soul attack.

Jian Wushuang dashed around in the battlefield in an eerie manner. The Blood Mountain Sword he was holding was like a poisonous snake.

This poisonous snake bit forward, slashed around in a weird manner or turning into a dark vortex that swallowed everything there was.

Jian Wushuang used whatever sword skills he had learnt within the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower on these experts.

The sword skills he used were the most ordinary ones. Every single skill he used seemed arbitrary, even Sword Principle Xuan Luo. He cast it effortlessly and smoothly. It was as though it was perfect!

It was polished and refined!

The experts in the Divine Demon Realm tried their best. However, the longer the battle went on, the more they realised how terrifying Jian Wushuan’s swords skills were. They were incredibly fast and he could both attack and defend. It was difficult for them to find a weakness. Most importantly... His sword skills were far too sophisticated.
