Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Your potential is the greatest in Green Fire World. As long as you have the opportunity and luck, you’ll become a Dao Master and perhaps even beyond that. With such a huge potential, who in Green Fire World would dare to mess with you?”

Gu King’s voice rang out.

Jian Wushuang fell silent. After a while, he sent a message saying: “Big Brother Wang Yuan, don’t tell other people that I’m still alive. If it is really necessary, you can tell Second Brother and Emperor Xiao.”

“Why?” Wang Yuan wondered.

If the news that Jian Wushuang was still alive got out, the entire Eternal World would be in shock.

Clans and Mansion Masters of the 36 prefectures in Tang of the East would pull back their plans because of Jian Wushuang. This meant peace for a short period of time. However, if Jian Wushuang’s survival remained as a secret, Tang of the East would continue to be trapped in the current mayhem.

“Tang of the East has been greatly devastated, and the situation is dire. However, such a dangerous state will reveal the hidden threats.” Jian Wushuang said in a severe tone. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Emperor Leng has governed Tang of the East for many years. Who knows what Tang of the East has become? If Emperor Xiao wants to take over Tang of the East fully, he must remove the threats.”

“Hence, just let the clans be. The more troubles they cause, the more threats will be revealed. When the time is right, we will remove all of them at once…”

“Besides, although I survived the battle ten years ago, I’m in poor condition now. Within a short period of time, I can’t show up in public. Even if you spread the news, no one will believe it. They will only think that Emperor Xiao has come to his wit’s end. It will cause more trouble.”

“Is that so? I understand.” Wang Yuan nodded heavily, agreeing with Jian Wushuang.

“By the way, how’s Leng Rushuang doing?” Jian Wushuang was worried about her.

He had asked about Tang of the East’s situation because Emperor Xiao had saved him, but most importantly because he cared about Leng Rushuang!

When he married her, he would be the emperor’s son-in-law. Naturally, he was obliged to help Tang of the East!

However, Leng Rushuang was a Primordial Great Sinner.

In the battle 10 years ago, Leng Rushuang went into a coma after being seriously injured. Although Gu King had managed to save her life, Jian Wushuang did not hear from her over the following decade.

“Her Highness…” Speaking of Leng Rushuang, Wang Yuan fell silent.

“What happened to her?” Jian Wushuang asked, sounding a little anxious.

“Don’t worry, she is well and has healed a lot from her injuries. But ever since after that war, she has been in a coma, and has not woken up since then.” Wang Yuan said.

“Still in a coma?” Jian Wushuang’s heart sank.

Even after becoming into blood fog, he had spent only 10 years to regain consciousness. Why was Leng Rushuang still in a coma?

“Gu King, what’s going on?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked Gu King.

Gu King was knowledgeable and knew more than Jian Wushuang about Primordial Great Sinners.

“I don’t know much about this too.”

Gu King shook his head. “Primordial Great Sinners are as rare as Inverse Cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World. I used to follow King Luo Zhen in the Eternal Chaotic World, and met one Primordial Great Sinner. So I got to have some understanding about them. However, your girl seems to be different from other Primordial Great Sinners.”

“Different?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Don’t worry, you must first heal your body and recover your strength. When you go to Tang of the East to visit her, let me take a closer look, and then maybe I can answer you,” said Gu King.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Big Brother Wang Yuan, watch over Tang of the East for me. If there is anything wrong, send me a message at once.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, I will.” Wang Yuan promised.

After their exchange, Jian Wushuang felt calmer.

“In my current state, I can’t save Tang of the East from trouble or do anything for Leng Rushuang who is in a coma. I must concentrate on recovering.” Jian Wushuang knew very well what he should do.

In the cave mansion deep underground, Jian Wushuang began to self-heal.

Even with the help of the treasures left behind by Dao Yuanzi, Jian Wushuang still needed a thousand years to recover.

Jian Wushuang could only be patient and focused on restoring his health.

Time passed slowly while he was healing himself.

In the eighteenth year after Jian Wushuang regained consciousness, Wang Yuan sent a message.

“Bad news! Bad news!”

“Third Brother, clans in Tang of the East joined forces and destroyed the Xia Clan’s Immortal Army. After Xia Clan fell, other forces in Tang of the East and some of the Mansion Masters from the 36 prefectures fought madly for their own interests.”

“The situation in the entire Tang of the East has spiraled out of control.”

It was the twentieth year after Jian Wushuang regained his consciousness.

“Third Brother, the Xia Clan has been eliminated. Their heritage treasures have been divided among various clans and experts. This battle is very fierce, and it is not ending. Many clans have made enemies in this battle and are still fighting against each other. But Emperor Xiao has stayed out of this.”

It was the sixtieth year.

“Trouble, Tang of the East is in big trouble.

“The Three Big Countries – West Paradise, South Mountain Kingdom, and North Sea Kingdom, had remained indifferent when Tang of the East was in turmoil. As peace is now being restored in Tang of the East, the Three Big Countries have started fighting simultaneously.

“They must have discussed beforehand, because they had brought along some clans of Tang of the East, including several Mansion Masters of the 36 prefectures. Tang of the East is almost defenseless now!

“Third Brother, when are you coming back?”
