Chapter 2496: Doing it the Hard Way

“Who are you, kid?” Strange Old Feng looked at Jian Wushuang with his weird evil eyes.

“Doesn’t matter who I am. I’m just here to make an exchange with you, Senior Feng,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What kind of exchange?” Strange Old Feng asked.

“I hear you have a drop of Purple Shimmer. I would like to exchange for it. I hope Senior Feng is willing to give it to me. I’ll of course exchange it for something of equal or even higher value,” said Jian Wushuang.

Strange Old Feng’s face turned cold. “Purple Shimmer? Hehe, Yun Zhen from Great Compassion Sect came to look for me and wanted it as well not long ago. Unfortunately, I didn’t agree. He wanted it but couldn’t get it and now he’s playing with his little tricks and asking a kid like you to exchange for it.”

Haha, does he think I’m an idiot? No matter what tactics he uses, the Great Compassion Sect can only dream about getting the Purple Shimmer from me! I’d rather destroy the Purple Shimmer than handing it to them!”

Jian Wushuang panicked and said, “Senior Feng, I’m not from the Great Compassion Sect and I’m in no way related to them either.”

“Hehe, do I look like I care if you’re related to them or otherwise? No matter what, I won’t give the Purple Shimmer to anyone. Only thing is, kid...” Strange Old Feng shot a glance at Jian Wushuang as his eyes shined with a discreet but sharp glint. “I don’t like your face, so...you must die!”

A wind blade immediately formed from nothing in front of Strange Old Feng.

In a flash, the wind blade disappeared and in the next moment, it appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had not expected Strange Old Feng to suddenly attack him as his face turned gloomy.

Furthermore, Strange Old Feng performed a deadly move immediately without worrying about his status as an Ultimate God expert.

However, it was not a threat to Jian Wushuang with that impromptu wind blade.

Jian Wushuang merely raised his hand, gripped the wind blade, and shattered it.

“Oh?” Strange Old Feng was surprised. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Second-Class Divine Demon?” Strange Old Feng’s disciple looked over in shock.

When Jian Wushuang was fighting, he concealed his divine power aura, hence nobody would sense his actual cultivation level.

As Strange Old Feng started a fight with him, his Second-Class Divine Demon’s divine power aura had been revealed.

“You’re a mere Second-Class Divine Demon, yet you could easily fend off my attack? Interesting.”

Strange Old Feng smiled weirdly, but his expression suddenly changed. “Oh, by the way, I heard rumors of a monster in Wusha Wilderness defeating three Supreme Elders of Great Compassion outside Saint’s Tomb being only at the cultivation level of Divine Demon Realm. After that, he even endured three direct palm strikes from Yun Zhen and forced the Great Compassion Sect to lower their heads. That monster is also good at sword principles and is very young. I guess that’s you?”

“Yes, it is.” Jian Wushuang immediately admitted.

“Haha, it’s really you! I think I remember your name, something like ‘Jian Wushuang’?” Strange Old Feng giggled.

“That’s correct. So I take it that you understand I have nothing to do with the Great Compassion Sect. As for the Purple Shimmer, it is me who wants it. I’m only forcing the Great Compassion Sect to get it for me. I wonder if you are willing to exchange the Purple Shimmer with me now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

In his mind, Strange Old Feng had deep grudges against the Great Compassion Sect, and the fact the Great Compassion Sect suffered a great loss under Jian Wushuang would have meant he helped Strange Old Feng let off some steam. In addition, the Purple Shimmer was not useful to Strange Old Feng. Strange Old Feng should probably be willing to exchange it with him.

However...

“Hell no!”

Strange Old Feng directly waved his hand. “Kid, whether or not you have a relationship with the Great Compassion Sect has got nothing to do with me. The Purple Shimmer is my possession. It’s my freedom whether I want to exchange it or not and now I don’t want you to have it, but if you can of course insist on having it. However, there’s one condition.”

“What would that be?” Jian Wushuang was still calm inside.

“It’s very simple. You knew I have beef with the Great Compassion Sect. Although you’ve killed many of its disciples, the effects toward their sect aren’t strong. I want you to seriously hurt Great Compassion Sect once by, for example, killing one of their Supreme Elders or something.” Strange Old Feng grinned devilishly.

“You want me to kill a Supreme Elder from the Great Compassion Sect?” Jian Wushuang squinted.

“That’s right. A Supreme Elder is worth a drop of Purple Shimmer. If you do so, you don’t need to exchange anything with me. I’ll give you that drop of Purple Shimmer directly. What do you say?” Strange Old Feng smiled. “Jian Wushuang, you can take your time to think about it. After all, you have pissed them off once and they couldn’t do anything to you. There’s no reason you can’t do it again if that’s the case!”

Jian Wushuang said, “My grudge with the Great Compassion Sect is already over, plus I’ve made peace with all the other sects. I’m not like you. I do care about my status as a person. If the Great Compassion Sect doesn’t cross me again, I won’t attack them.”

“Is that so? Then I can’t help you. That drop of Purple Shimmer will always stay in my Interspatial Ring, hehe. Even though it doesn’t do me much good by keeping it, just watching you suckers scratching your heads over it makes me happy.” Strange Old Feng began to giggle.

“Looks like it’s impossible to have a fair trade with you.” Jian Wushuang’s eyesight began to turn frosty.

He did not plan to fight as Strange Old Feng was an Ultimate God after all. If the joint attacks of Yun Zhen and his three Supreme Elders could not even defeat him, he was not one to be taken lightly. Jian Wushuang knew it was wise not to cross him, hence he was being polite and humble throughout.

Naturally, it would be best if Strange Old Feng was willing to exchange.

However... Strange Old Feng was not willing, hence Jian Wushuang had employed more forceful tactics.

“Now you wanna do it the hard way since the easy way didn’t work? Who do you think you are?” Strange Old Feng was not afraid at all while he looked at Jian Wushuang in ridicule.

“It’s not possible If I’m the only one doing it, but...” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“What if I joined in?” A grand deep voice suddenly filled the air.

Yun Zhen’s figure suddenly appeared in the void.

“Oh, Yun Zhen? You guys seem prepared.” Strange Old Feng’s expression darkened as well but felt no fear.

“Strange Old Feng, hand over the Purple Shimmer. I’m still willing to exchange it for something more valuable. If not, I’ll have to attack. Don’t forget your disciple is right here. Aren’t you worried I would kill him?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold and slightly threatening.
