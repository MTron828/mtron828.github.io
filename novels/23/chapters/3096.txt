Chapter 3097: Mystic Realm Opened

Bang!

The sword light carried a terrifying impact force and instantly sent Gu Tong flying.

Gu Tong kept rolling in the air and finally stopped.

The geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces who were watching the battle were all shocked.

“He lost?”

“He lost so quickly?”

“It was only a split second. How could Gu Tong lose so quickly?”

Most people found it unbelievable and found it hard to accept the result.

At first, they thought Gu Tong would win. After all, Gu Tong was recognized as the strongest expert among the first level True Saints of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. If Gu Tong had defeated Jian Wushuang in such a split second, they would have thought it was reasonable, but now, Gu Tong had lost.

They could not accept being defeated by the outsider, Heavenly Sword Marquis, in such a short time.

“How is it possible? How can your divine power be so strong? And how can your sword be so fast?” Gu Tong stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Is your divine power strong? Is your sword fast?” Jian Wushuang could not help but smile in his heart.

As a perfect chaotic creature, he was much more advanced than special creatures like Xiong Tao, so it was natural that his divine power was powerful.

As for why his swordsmanship was so fast…if it was 50 years ago, when he had just reached the third stage of comprehending the space-time principles, his swordsmanship was not so fast. But in these 50 years, he had not only made great progress in the reincarnation principles, but also in the space-time principles.

Now, he was also in the third stage of the space-time principles, but he had made some achievements. In terms of level, his comprehension of the space-time principles should be comparable to that of an ordinary rank five True Saint.

In terms of comprehending the space-time principle at the level of a rank five True Saint, his speed was very fast. Each sword was stronger than the last. It was already amazing that Gu Tong could block the first eight swords, but he was not able to block the ninth sword, naturally, he was defeated.

“I told you that Xiong Tao was defeated by me. You don’t believe me,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Gu Tong fell silent.

Before the battle, he did not believe that Jian Wushuang could defeat Xiong Tao directly.

But after the real battle, he had to believe it.

“Well, your battle has come to an end. Gu Tong, you should be convinced now,” Mo Shan’s voice came from the side.

Gu Tong took a deep look at Jian Wushuang, but did not say anything more.

At first, he was really unconvinced, thinking that the three Palace Masters should not give such a precious spot to an outsider.

But now that he had really fought with Jian Wushuang, he was not unconvinced. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

To put it bluntly, in this world, strength reigned supreme no matter where.

Previously, he thought that Jian Wushuang’s strength and talent were not as good as his, but now that he knew that Jian Wushuang’s strength was far above his, he had nothing to say.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, Piercing Tiger, and Thunder God, you three should get ready. The Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is about to open,” Mo Shan said.

“Yes.” Piercing Tiger and Thunder God immediately nodded.

Jian Wushuang also put away his long sword and stood there quietly waiting.

Although the geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces still looked at Jian Wushuang from time to time, they did not have the same discussions and dissatisfaction as before. After all, Jian Wushuang had proven himself with his strength.

An hour passed quickly.

“My lord, we are ready,” the Peak True Saint stood in front of Mo Shan and said respectfully.

“Well, open it,” Mo Shan ordered. Then he waved his hand and took out three tokens.

These three tokens represented the three places to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

As Mo Shan threw the three tokens into the void in front of them, the void in front of them rippled, and then three space passages appeared in front of them.

“These three passages can enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. You three can choose which passage to enter. In addition, there are many opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, and any one of them is very precious and rare. As for what opportunities you can get in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, it depends on your luck and luck,” Mo Shan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart was moved.

Obviously, the geniuses who entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm would get different opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

“Elder Mo Shan, how long can we stay in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well…I’m not sure.” Mo Shan smiled and said, “Because everyone gets different opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, and the time spent is also different. But under normal circumstances, you have already got that opportunity, or you have already got more than half of it. But when you can’t get more opportunities in the short term, you will be sent out.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“The Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is very magical. It’s a rare opportunity for the three of you to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. Remember to cherish this opportunity. Alright, go in.” Mo Shan waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang, Piercing Tiger, and Thunder God looked at each other. Without hesitation, they each chose a passage and directly entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

…

With a flash of light, when Jian Wushuang reappeared, he found himself in an extremely strange space.

It was gray and full of haziness. With the naked eye, even the range of ten palms around him could not be seen clearly. Even if he used his soul power to check, he could only reach a range of 300 meters.

Now, when Jian Wushuang used his soul power to spread out, he saw an endless gray airflow.

This gray air current was very unique and gave Jian Wushuang a different feeling.

“Is this a chaotic air current?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “No, it seems to be more advanced than ordinary chaotic air currents.”

He could feel the incredible power contained in this gray air current.

This power made him very shocked.

“Elder Mo Shan said that there are countless opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, and everyone has the same opportunities. But now that I’ve come to this strange space, where are the opportunities around here?”

Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

But suddenly…

Buzz!

The void suddenly shook, as if the whole world was about to collapse.

Jian Wushuang’s heart also trembled. Then he saw the endless gray airflow in front of him was pushed away by a strong force. A huge object slowly descended and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, it completely blocked Jian Wushuang’s line of sight.

This huge object was a huge, boundless black stone pillar!
