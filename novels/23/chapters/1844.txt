Chapter 1845: Sect Master!!!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Colored Glaze Sanctuary, inside the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

As one of the founders of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, Emperor God Tian Xiao then was extremely furious.

“Ranked thirtieth on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list? The higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance actually placed Jian Wushuang in the top thirty?”

“Damn it. Even Star Palace Master is ranked thirty-first and he is one position lower than Jian Wushuang. In other words, Jian Wushuang has already surpassed the Star Palace Master?”

As Emperor God Tian Xiao thought about it, flames of fury emerged from his heart.

It should be known that more than six thousand years ago, when Jian Wushuang had clashed head-on with the Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent, Emperor God Tian Xiao had once fought with Jian Wushuang head-on.

Back then, Jian Wushuang’s abilities were not too different from his.

However, in just over six thousand years, Jian Wushuang had already surpassed him completely to get into the top thirty of the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

At such a level, he could be considered an outstanding figure among the Peak Emperor Gods.

In other words, if he were to come across Jian Wushuang again, there would be no room for him to resist and he could only escape miserably.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s accomplishments were displayed there. For those people whose abilities were weaker than his, it would be next to impossible for them to escape from his hands.

This caused Emperor God Tian Xiao to be even more furious.

Beside him, Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren felt chilly.

Originally, they had thought that as long as they were to join the Soaring Heaven King Palace, with their protection, Jian Wushuang would not be able to do anything to them. However, looking at it then, this was not the case.

Even the Deluge Fortress, which contained thirteen Almighties and was overseen by Fortress Master Hong Tian, had been destroyed by Jian Wushuang easily. As for the Soaring Heaven King Palace then, wasn’t the number of Almighties it possessed less than that of the Deluge Fortress?

“Fortunately, the Soaring Heaven King Palace has a great foundation and that Great Emperor Colored Glaze has shown herself personally to warn Jian Wushuang. As long as the both of us stay in the territories that are controlled by the Soaring Heaven King Palace, this Jian Wushuang will not dare to be reckless.”

“However, if Jian Wushuang continues growing at such a frightening speed, there will come a day where even Great Emperor Colored Glaze will be unable to suppress him. At that time…”

Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren looked at each other and their eyes were filled with fear.

After that, Sir God Xuan Bing said immediately: “Palace Master, that Jian Wushuang’s speed of growth is too fast and we definitely cannot let him continue growing. Hence, we have to find an opportunity to get rid of him as fast as possible.”

“Of course, do you think that I need you to tell me that?” Emperor God Tian Xiao stared at Sir God Xuan Bing and his expression turned grave. “Jian Wushuang’s current abilities are out of the ordinary. The only way that is possible for the Soaring Heaven King Palace to kill Jian Wushuang is to let big brother take action personally!”

“Big brother…”

As Emperor God Tian Xiao muttered to himself, he took out a token and he sent a message to Emperor God Tian Ling, who was still in the Second Lair, “Big brother, when are you able to come back? That Jian Wushuang’s speed of growth is too fast and I am completely unable to suppress him.”

After the token was silent for some time, a message was finally sent over, “I will definitely return within three thousand years!”

“Three thousand years?” Emperor God Tian Xiao’s heart moved and his eyes revealed a delighted expression after that, “Jian Wushuang, I shall allow you to run amuck for another three thousand years. After three thousand years, when big brother takes action personally, you shall die!!”

…

This was a territory which was concealed deeply and was extremely far away from the Ten Sanctuaries.

This whole territory was covered by a giant formation and this formation was not a normal protective formation of a sect. It was a formation that was deployed after depleting a great amount of resources along with many Almighties who specialized in formations, as well as two Great Emperor-level experts taking action personally.

Hence, such a great formation was extremely powerful.

Even if a Great Emperor were to descend, not only would he be unable to destroy the great formation, his life would be at risk if he were to enter the great formation.

In the whole of Eternal Chaotic World, probably only the great formation in the Thunderbolt Island, which was the base of the Sanctuary Alliance, could be compared to this great formation.

As for the large territory that the great formation covered, it was the base of the Holocaust Sect!

The Holocaust Sect was a dark powerhouse which operated beneath the Eternal Chaotic World throughout the years. Similar to the Acheron Palace, the Holocaust Sect was one of the greatest threats to the Sanctuary Alliance.

At that moment, at the center of a hall which contained a standalone space in the base of the Holocaust Sect, there was huge sacrificial altar which was floating.

At the highest point of the sacrificial altar, there was a throne made of ice jade. On the throne, a white-clothed woman whose face was covered by a veil was seated.

As the white-clothed woman was covered with a veil, her whole face could not be seen clearly. However, even with just the small part of her face which was revealed, it was enough to captivate countless cultivators.

As for the pair of eyes that she revealed, they were ice-cold, like frost on a dried fish.

“Master, this is the piece of news that has come from the Sanctuary Alliance and you can take a look at it,” a black-robed old woman who was by the side handed a token to the white-clothed woman with respect.

The white-clothed woman took the token and scanned through it with her consciousness.

“Oh?”

An indifferent voice which was filled with surprise could be heard and the white-clothed woman’s eyes were filled with astonishment, “Rank thirty in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list? Haha, this is really shocking. As expected of the man of this body of mine… looks like if we were to clash with the Sanctuary Alliance head-on in the future, he would become a big threat to my Holocaust Sect.”

“Master, there are now many people in the Sanctuary Alliance saying that there is a huge possibility of Jian Wushuang becoming the second Emperor Bai and this is not good. Hence, we have no choice but to take precautions. If we can find the opportunity, we had better get rid of him as soon as possible,” the black-robed old woman said.

“Get rid of him?” the white-clothed woman’s eyes turned cold and she shook her head, “Assassinating and getting rid of geniuses of the Sanctuary Alliance are things that the Acheron Palace should do and it is unrelated to the Holocaust Sect. Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s identity is special. Without my orders, no one in the Holocaust Sect is to take action against him!”

“Understood,” the black-robed old woman nodded her head repeatedly and she did not dare to go against her.

“Oh no. How are the preparations with regards to that matter?” the white-clothed woman asked abruptly.

“The preparations are already done. All the experts under the Holocaust Sect are in place and everything can proceed according to the plan,” the black-robed old woman said.

“Great,” the white-clothed woman laughed, “After planning and preparing carefully for so many years, we have finally come to this stage. Send an order that we will proceed according to the plan after ten days.”

“Understood,” the black-robed old woman accepted the order.

Ten days later, in the base of the Holocaust Sect in the dark region of the Eternal Chaotic World, a frightening massacre storm burst forth without any warnings.

This storm was earth-shaking and countless experts fell in this battle. In particular, out of Almighties alone, more than thirty of them fell!

If such a frightening great battle were to happen in the Sanctuary Alliance or the Eternal Chaotic World, it would definitely result in an unprecedented storm.

However, as it had happened in the dark region, it was quiet, as if it had never happened before.

After the great battle, in the floating giant sacrificial altar in the standalone space.

The white-clothed woman who was covered with a veil still sat like before, and below her legs there were close to a hundred experts who had knelt down with respect.

“Greetings to Sect Master!!!”

The voices shook the heaven.

On that very day, the Holocaust Sect underwent a great change and a Sect Master was born.

Moreover, the Sect Master had the surname Leng!
