In the end, after being acquitted and released from prison, he became one of the senior elders.

Now, he resided in the Elder Palace, his power fully restored, thriving in the world.

For a tier 6 Emperor to enter the Second Prison was akin to a tier 5 Emperor entering the Third Prison, with a 90 percent chance of falling.

Going in meant facing death.

Inside, they imprisoned ancient demons and ferocious beasts, each incredibly powerful, possessing the strength of a tier 6 peak.

Even though Shan Jun was a Demon Lord, his power had been suppressed for so long. He was just freed and thrown into the Second Prison; life was not easy, and there was a high possibility of perishing.

Zhen Ling had long been displeased with these Devouring Demons and oppressed them as soon as they emerged.

As for the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons, he was completely enslaved, becoming a living target, splitting into millions of avatars, serving as stepping stones for Grand Yan Immortals and even Yan Immortals.

As for Wind Demon, he had allied himself with the Xuanwu Palace, and Zhen Ling didn‚Äôt want to intervene. But the remaining few, he planned to deal with one by one, especially Heart Demon, an ambitious fellow. He couldn‚Äôt afford to leave someone like that alive.

Ambition coupled with power.

What he feared most was Heart Demon.

Although Heart Demon was powerful, it didn‚Äôt mean he lacked fear.

Zhen Ling blinked his small eyes.

Heart Demon had almost become the Lord of Heart Demons back then; how could he not be afraid?

Demon Sound Mountain.

On Jian Wushuangs side, he had no idea that his consumption of the universe‚Äôs origin source had alarmed a formidable figure.

For him, Zhen Ling was indeed a god.

He was the god of the Qishen Temple, and even in the long river of time and space outside the Original Universe, he could be considered a godlike figure.ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

In the mysterious space where time flowed at an exaggerated speed, there

existed a great figure inheriting the legacy of the Qishen Temple, capable of suppressing the universe with a mere wave of their hand.

‚ÄúPhew! ‚Äù

Jian Wushuang slowly rose, completely digesting the essence of the universe‚Äôs origin source. His Extreme Dao became even more profound, and the power of all things responded to his every movement.

Crack!

He clenched his fist, and black thunder crackled around him. This was not the power of his physical body; it was the power of the origin source.

His Yan power had begun to transform, becoming the power of all things, although still somewhat incomplete.

‚Äúl unexpectedly mastered a bit of the power of all things in advance.‚Äù

After receiving the complete inheritance, Hu Qing gained the power of Samsara. Now, without practicing any supreme techniques, he had acquired the unique power of all things in the universe.

He had some understanding of this phenomenon.

The strongest individuals in the myriad Dao path could grasp a bit of the power of all things when they reached the extreme level.

Upon closer inspection, his Extreme Dao seemed to be an upgraded version of the myriad Daos, more stable and powerful than the myriad Daos.

Since mastering the Extreme Dao, he had progressed from Thought power to the power of devouring. Now, the power of all things had emerged, indicating that his speculation was correct.

Once the Extreme Dao broke through to the seventh level, he could truly master the power of devouring, completely eliminating any thoughts of devouring. Moreover, the power of the seventh level would completely transform into the power of all things.

Currently, he had only grasped a bit of it. Once he truly mastered the power of all things, his strength at that time would probably surpass that of an ordinary Emperor.

The power of all things!

He had heard Qiuhuang mention it. It was just an unintentional remark when introducing the myriad Daos.

He hadn‚Äôt expected to possess such an ability.

‚ÄòQuite interesting, isn‚Äôt it? With my current strength, I‚Äôm probably invincible even among Grand Yan Immortals. This trial has become somewhat boring.‚Äù Jian Wushuang sighed.

He hadn‚Äôt expected that this journey of his physical body was initially meant to enhance his body to the utmost, but it had led to a breakthrough in his origin source, propelling his Extreme Dao into the sixth layer and his Ultimate Sword Dao into the seventh layer.

Such opportunities were rare in one‚Äôs lifetime.

Now, Jian Wushuang had gained confidence in the path of Dao merge, even though Shan Jun had mentioned that it wouldn‚Äôt be difficult within the Qishen Temple. Still, he couldn‚Äôt afford to be careless.

Becoming an Integrated Immortal and mastering the path of Dao merge were both significant hurdles. Even with the support of top-tier treasures, he dared not be complacent.

When the last trace of his origin source completely merged, Jian Wushuangs figure vanished from the mysterious space.

Shan Jun, who was sitting cross-legged in the center, slowly stood up, his eyes filled with starlight.

At first, he was puzzled by Jian Wushuangs lack of reaction and later felt regretful for the skeleton on the throne.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt choose the Devouring Dao!‚Äù

Shan Jun felt a sense of confusion.

He deliberately placed that skeleton there, wanting to see Jian Wushuangs reaction. However, Jian MJushuang showed no response whatsoever, leaving

Shan Jun perplexed about the devouring power within Jian Wushuang.

In the mysterious space, only Shan Jun remained, lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang had been transported to the top floor of the Trial Tower.

This place represented the pinnacle of achievement and perfection.

Once the Ninth Refinement was completed, his physical body would be thoroughly perfected. Though it wouldn‚Äôt reach the innate level of perfection, its postnatal strength would still be exceptionally crafted, flawless in every aspect.

In ancient times, when the focus was on the physical body, there were prodigies who underwent the Nine Refinements.

In the present era, or rather, among the geniuses in the River of Time, no one paid attention to whether their physical bodies were perfected because nobody pursued the path of divine bodies.

It was just too challenging!

In ancient times, the flesh and divine bodies of several Beast Gods sustained an era. But now, what remains?

One couldn‚Äôt possibly hunt down special lives to strengthen oneself!

In the Original Universe, it might not be obvious, but in the River of Time, Special Life Forms were united. Though not of the same lineage, they were of the same kind.

All Special Llfe Forms naturally formed groups.

This was the confidence of Chishui. He had no roots, no origins, and no ties.

The destruction of the Original Universe had nothing to do with him. At worst, he could run away and do even better in the River of Time.

Hunting down Special Life Forms to pursue the divine body path was simply unrealistic.

Apart from this path, there were only geniuses and treasures of heaven and earth left. These things weren‚Äôt something ordinary powers could produce. To accumulate a divine body that was tens of thousands of times stronger after birth, one would need to have broken through the origin source long ago with the necessary resources and energy.

So, at present, very few pursued the divine body path, and one could even say there were almost none.

Only Special Life Forms would take this path.

Cultivators wouldn‚Äôt choose this path at all. If they had the courage, they would be better off cultivating various Dao paths, at least comparable to the Ultimate Dao.

The divine body path might not even match up to the Ultimate Emperors even after breaking through tens of thousands of times.

Most origin source experts would enhance their divine bodies to 5,000 times at most. That was enough to bear the origin source. Going beyond that was just a waste. Whether the divine body was perfect or not didn‚Äôt really matter. Why waste so many resources?

That was the concern of cultivators nowadays.

Jian Wushuang was different. His origin source was exceptionally powerful, and he needed a strong divine body. A powerful divine body naturally led to a perfect physical body.

Moreover, it had to be taken to the extreme for a solid foundation.

A mere tens of millions of treasure points didn‚Äôt count for much.

Compared to the path ahead, what did these things matter?

The enhancement of the basic divine body wasn‚Äôt a small expense.

It was only 4,000 times stronger. Going up another 1,000 times would probably require several million treasure points.

The further one progressed, the more countless treasures were needed to accumulate..
