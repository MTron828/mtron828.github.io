“Three Blood Swords and one piece of The Investiture of the Gods!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Overlord waved his hand and a square stone tablet suddenly appeared in his hand.

The stone tablet expanded in the wind and soon, it was like a small mound, sitting in the center of the hall.

Jian Wushuang looked at it carefully and saw that the stone tablet was dark and the words ‘Investiture of the Gods’ were written on it.

“Commander Blood Sword, please accept this God Sealing Tablet,” the Overlord laughed heartily.

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang did not refuse and put The Investiture of the Gods into his Interspatial Ring.

“We congratulate Commander Blood Sword. In the future, the seven of us will have to take care of each other and work together.” When the six commanders saw this, they congratulated him.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

The Overlord saw this scene and could not help but nod to himself. He then said to the six commanders, “Buxu, Mountain Shaker, Cold Disaster…the six of you will each select ten Omega Rulers from your subordinates and hand them over to Commander Blood Sword.”

“Yes!”

The six commanders quickly acknowledged.

After that, the Overlord gave some more instructions and ordered them to retreat.

After Jian Wushuang and the other seven commanders left, the Overlord Divine Palace fell into silence.

The smile on the Overlord’s face gradually disappeared. He looked at the empty hall and said indifferently, “Fei Ying, what do you think of this Blood Sword?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a thin black shadow walked out from behind the Overlord.

His entire body was covered in a black robe, making it impossible to see his appearance. He knelt down on one knee and replied in a hoarse voice, “Lord Overlord, I can’t tell how powerful this Blood Sword is, but I can roughly estimate that it’s probably already at the threshold of an unparalleled Ruler.”

“The threshold to becoming an invincible Ruler, huh?”

The Overlord squinted his eyes and raised his head to look into the distance. No one knew what he was thinking, but his fingers rhythmically tapped on the armrest of the Dragon Throne, making a ‘du du du’ sound.

The black-robed figure continued, “Lord Overlord, and…I can sense that the Blood Sword has discovered me.”

The Overlord nodded and did not reply. After a long while, he slowly said, “This Blood Sword isn’t a simple person. I don’t believe that someone who can kill an almost invincible Ruler as a fifth-stage great Ruler would remain unknown in the universe.”

“Fei Ying, go out and investigate this Blood Sword for me. You must find out what kind of divine being this Blood Sword is.”

“Yes!”

The black-clothed figure’s voice sank as he planned to fly out.

“Wait.”

The Overlord opened his mouth again and called out to him. His eyes flickered as he said, “Don’t alarm anyone for this investigation. I have something to tell you.”

“What is it? You can speak your mind, my Lord.”

“Make a trip to the tenth city and find the person who broke through to the eighth level in the God Refining Tower! If you find this person, you must lower your attitude and tell him that this King has invited him to meet.”

“Yes, sir!”

After the black-clothed figure left, the Overlord sat on the Dragon Throne. A thoughtful look flashed through his eyes, and then he slowly closed his eyes.

…

In just one day, Jian Wushuang’s seventh governor’s mansion was completed. It was built with various divine materials and looked extremely luxurious.

That night, the night wind was blowing. Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in a wing room, holding the Interspatial Ring that the Overlord had given him today, and a playful look flashed in his eyes.

Today, in the hall, the Overlord seemed to be bold and generous. In fact, Jian Wushuang could feel that the Overlord was obviously suspicious of him. Behind the Overlord, there was a pair of cold eyes staring at him.

However, Jian Wushuang did not take it to heart. After all, his appearance and rise were too sudden. If it were anyone else, Xin Zhou would have some thoughts.

“In a few more days, when the Wuqi Divine Sword is completely repaired, I’ll leave this place.”

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought. he had not entered the eight cities on the Ancient Path of Stars to risk his life for others.

Then, Jian Wushuang turned over his right hand and the Wuqi Divine Sword was placed in front of his knees.

The Wuqi Divine Sword was stained with spots of poison, which were caused by the venom of the Heavenly Snake Playboy when it dripped on the Wuqi Divine Sword.

However, after Jian Wushuang had nourished it with divine power day and night during this period of time, more than half of the poisonous spots had been removed. There were only some marks left.

It would not take long for the Wuqi Divine Sword to be completely repaired.

Jian Wushuang flipped his right hand again and two poisonous fangs floated in front of him.

The two venomous fangs were the essence of Heavenly Snake Playboy. When Heavenly Snake Playboy was killed by Jian Wushuang, only these two venomous fangs were left.

These two venomous fangs can probably be refined into three drops of venom, and just one drop of venom is enough to kill a weaker invincible Ruler like Lord Zhennan. When the three of them are used together, even the Conqueror, who has the undying Overlord body, will have to retreat.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and he immediately began to refine the two venomous fangs.

Time flew by, and three months passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, while Jian Wushuang was cultivating, Commander Mountain Shaker’s hearty laughter suddenly came from outside the door.

“Blood Sword, the six of us have finished selecting the final Rulers. Come out and take a look.”

In the wing room, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and a light flashed in his eyes.

Back then, the Overlord had said that each of the six commanders would choose ten Ultimate Rulers from their own subordinates and hand them over to Jian Wushuang. It seemed that the six commanders had already completed their selection and were here to send the people over.

“They’re here.”

Jian Wushuang replied indifferently. Then, he took a step forward and disappeared from the room.

…

At the same time, at the entrance of the tenth city.

A black shadow condensed. Then, a hunchbacked monster with spikes on its back appeared at the entrance of the Tenth City’s passage.

“So this is the Tenth City? There doesn’t seem to be anything special about it.” The monster’s white eyes rolled slightly as it looked up at the Tenth City and clicked its tongue.

This person was Qiu Long!

“Hey, you dog slave. You said that the Blood Sword has arrived in the tenth city, right?”

Beside him was a grey-haired old man who was being held by a black chain.

The old man with white hair and a white beard had both his hands and feet on the ground. He looked at Qiu Long with fear in his eyes.

If Jian Wushuang had been there, he would have realized that the old man was the City Lord of the Ninth City! A veteran Ultimate Ruler!

“It’s…yes, but I don’t know if the Blood Sword has left the Tenth City and entered the last eight cities.”

The Ninth City’s City Lord said in a trembling voice.

“Hehe, it’s fine. I can take my time to look for him.”

Qiu Long grinned, revealing two rows of sharp and cold teeth
