Chapter 3931: The Plan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After a long while, the six Rulers finally managed to recover from their shock. However, what followed was an unprecedented excitement and ecstasy.

After all, these experts were brought back by Jian Wushuang, and they were obviously under his orders.

They had been worried that the Devil Cloud Star Army would arrive in a thousand years. How could they not be excited when a group of top-notch Masters suddenly appeared?

The dozens of experts in front of them were definitely a huge amount of peak battle strength for the Divine Beginning Realm!

They did not have the confidence to face the Devil Cloud Star Army because they were far inferior to Devil Cloud Star in terms of peak battle strength.

!!

If they were to put aside their peak combat power and compete with the Principles Masters, the Divine Beginning Realm would have the absolute advantage. However, in a life-and-death battle like that, peak combat power was obviously more important. And now…with so many powerful Rulers appearing all of a sudden, their extremely empty peak combat power became incomparably tyrannical.

This immediately gave them a lot more confidence.

“My young friend.”

Daoist Xuan God quietly came over and asked in a low voice, “Can you control or deploy the Rulers behind you?”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “These people have been subdued by me. I even left a mark in their soul origin. It can be said that their lives are in my hands. How can they dare to disobey my orders?”

“That’s good.” Daoist Xuan God’s eyes lit up.

He was worried that Jian Wushuang would not be able to completely control these experts. Not only would there be a great storm, but they would also be unable to use their battle strength to the limit during the battle with the Devil Cloud Star Army, but now that he heard that Jian Wushuang had left a mark in these experts’ soul origin, he was completely relieved.

“By the way, besides these experts, there are also many treasures in this interspatial ring. Take a look.” Jian Wushuang smiled and took out another interspatial ring.

“Treasures?”

The eyes of Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and Heaven Ancestor shone with a strange light.

The four of them knew what Jian Wushuang was capable of. Back then, Jian Wushuang had brought back two batches of treasures, both from the Red Cloud World. The first batch was a large number of supreme treasures, including 100 Supreme Treasures, the second batch was the Three-layered Dao Realm, which made them ecstatic.

But this time, what did Jian Wushuang bring back?

“Oh my God!”

“Oh my God!”

“No, I can’t believe it!”

The few of them, who had been looking forward to it, stared at the treasures in Jian Wushuang’s interspatial ring with their eyes wide open.

They could not even hide the shock in their hearts and cried out in surprise.

It was not their fault that they were so shocked. The treasures in the interspatial ring were really incredible to them.

Supreme true treasures!

The interspatial ring had supreme true treasures! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang had brought back 100 supreme true treasures last time, and the Rulers had several supreme true treasures with them. They would not be too surprised to see supreme true treasures again, but now…they could not help being shocked.

Because the interspatial ring was filled with countless supreme treasures.

There were so many of them, at least thousands of them!

And some of them emitted an extremely powerful aura. They were obviously Supreme Treasures of the supreme grade.

“How can there be so many supreme treasures?” Daoist Xuan God’s eyes widened in disbelief.

The others had similar expressions.

Jian Wushuang was the only one who looked calm and had a faint smile on his face.

He had killed many Rulers during his adventure in the Eternal Dark Prison, especially the Star Demon Ancestor. He had suppressed and killed hundreds of them in one go.

After all, these Rulers had survived for hundreds of chaos cycles in the Eternal Dark Prison. Each of them had killed many experts during their long adventure, so they naturally had many treasures in their hands.

The first Ruler Jian Wushuang killed in the Eternal Dark Prison was Lord Siyi, who was at the peak of the second level. However, after killing him, Jian Wushuang obtained more than 20 supreme treasures, later, he killed many Rulers. Even the weakest one was no weaker than Lord Siyi. There were many third level Rulers and even the strongest experts in the dark zone.

Jian Wushuang also killed Star Demon Ancestor, and the experts he had subdued had many treasures. Although Jian Wushuang did not ask for most of the treasures, they did not need ordinary supreme treasures, naturally, he gave them all to Jian Wushuang.

With all the supreme treasures, Jian Wushuang had a lot of supreme treasures. Now, he had taken out about 70 percent of the supreme treasures and thousands of them.

“Supreme treasures are extremely common in the Eternal Dark Prison. They are not valuable at all. However, in this Star Field, the supreme treasures are the real treasures.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

Now, when Daoist Xuan God and the others saw so many supreme treasures, they were shocked beyond words.

“These supreme treasures are not of much use to me now. Xuan God, think about how you can make the most of them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.”

Xuan God had been calm since the destruction of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. He immediately discussed with the Temporal Temple Master and the others.

Soon, the result came out.

“My young friend, the number of Supreme Treasures you gave us is indeed too many. This Star Field is too small, so it’s impossible for us to make full use of them. At most, we can only make use of part of their value, but it’s worth trying,” Xuan God said.

“Do you have a plan?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Yes, we do.” Daoist Xuan God nodded slightly. “We plan to tell the public that we have a large number of top-tier supreme treasures.”

“Tell the public?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes, tell the public.” Daoist Xuan God smiled and said, “With this batch of supreme treasures and the many top-tier supreme treasures you brought back for us, we can’t use so many of them in the divine beginning realm alone. Therefore, we plan to use this batch of supreme treasures to try our best to win over the forces or experts in this Star Field.”
