Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jin Ling.”

Fang Han looked at Jin Ling and said in a cold voice, “I won’t get involved in the matters between you and Jian Wushuang from now on. If you want to mess with him, do it by yourself. I won’t help you.”

Jin Ling’s expression changed slightly. He nodded and said, “I understand.”

“You can leave,” Fang Han waved his hand.

Jin Ling walked out the tent with a gloomy look on his face.

As soon as he got outside the tent, his face immediately distorted.?“How dare Fang Han give me the cold shoulder?”

A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes, but he quickly calmed down.?“What’s going on? Fang Han previously promised me that he would deal with Jian Wushuang. Why did he suddenly change his mind?”

He immediately went to ask the sergeants of the Seventh Army, but he was shocked by their answers.

“Jian Wushuang battled Fang Han? And he even defeated him?”

“Fang Han was wounded by Jian Wushuang?”

Jin Ling finally understood.

After figuring everything out, he felt even more resentment towards Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang participated in the Divine General assessment with me, but he is already capable of defeating the East Camp’s commander. How did he make such a progress so quickly... The Fourth Story of the Earth Core Palace... Yes, he must have used Emperor Fengxiao’s Jade Slip and gone to the Fourth Story of the Earth Core Palace to cultivate for ten days. Otherwise, he could not have improved so quickly.”

“Bastard, that Jade Slip should have been mine!”

“Jian Wushuang, damn you!”

Jin Ling roared in his heart.

“I can’t depend on Fang Han anymore, so I will have to think of other ways to deal with Jian Wushuang.”

It was a sweltering summer day and the heat from the sun was actually baking the ground.

At the forefront of East Camp stood the vast plains occupied by the Demonic Beasts.

Boom... Countless Demonic Beasts were gathering at an alarming rate. In a short time, thousands of Demonic Beasts had gathered.

These Demonic Beasts had strange appearances, with two types of Demonic Beasts taking up the majority.

The first type had a human-shaped body with the head of a leopard.

The second type had black scales all over their bodies and crawled on the ground with eight arms like a spider.

These two types of Demonic Beasts came from two of the larger groups of monsters.

In the center of the Demonic Beasts, there was a short young man. He looked like a human being, but his eyes were scarlet. Naturally, he was a transformed Demonic Beast.

“Boys, today is the wedding of our Monster Kings, so we’re family now. Master Gu Qing has said that today is our carnival day. We are free to slaughter as we like,” the short man growled.

Hearing the word “slaughter”, the Demonic Beasts immediately roared excitedly.

It was in the Demonic Beasts’ very nature to enjoy slaughter.

“Haha, boys, what are you waiting for? Go, let’s go to the Huaman Territory,” the short man exclaimed.

“Roar!!” “Howl!!” “Moo!!”

The echoes of their loud roars filled the surrounding areas as the thousands of Demonic Beasts rushed forward.

Countless Demonic Beasts, which were releasing an extremely violent aura, had formed a huge torrent as they rushed toward the Human’s Territory.

In an instant, the whole area began to shake.

Before long, the huge torrent of Demonic Beasts had appeared just outside of the territory guarded by the East Camp.

An army of the East camp was guarding this area, but when the commander saw the countless Demonic Beasts, he was both stunned and horrified because he had never seen so many Demonic Beasts gathered in one place before.

“Activate the Formation, quickly!”

“Sound the alarm, sound the alarm! Demonic Beast attack, Demonic Beast attack!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The commander immediately took corresponding measures.

“Haha, boys, let’s go do some killing!”

The short man in the center of the Demonic Beast torrent laughed loudly as the Demonic Beasts began to attack the Formation ferociously.

The Terrible Demonic Beast torrent frightened every sergeant that was guarding this territory.

“My god, so many Demonic Beasts?”

“No, no! It’s the Monster Army. The Monster Army is coming!”

“The alarm, sound the alarm! The Monster Army of over 10,000 Demonic Beasts is coming!”

“Retreat, keep retreating, the Formation can’t hold for long!”

Messages for help were transmitted to the high officials of the East Camp, immediately causing the whole East Camp to be in shock.

Sky Solitude Mountains. Jian Wushuang had just returned from the East Camp.

“Brother Wushuang, what was the result?” Qing Huo and several sergeants came to greet him.

“Rest assured. Another squad will be coming to take over soon,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“Really?”

“That’s so great!”

Qing Huo and the other sergeants of the tenth squad were overjoyed.

They did not want to stay in the Sky Solitude Mountains for another second.

“Qing Huo, I exchanged the achievements for killing those monster spies for some Monster Cores. Divide them with our brothers,” Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring.

“Wushuang, what do you mean?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Because of me, they had to stay here in vain for two months. They deserve to get the Monster Cores,” Jian Wushuang said and laughed.

“Well, that’s true,” Qing Huo nodded heavily. He then began to distribute the Monster Cores to the other sergeants.

Hearing that, the sergeants were surprised and pleased. With this, Jian Wushuang had completely earned their respect.

They had known that they were sent to guard this area because of Jian Wushuang. They had complained about it in their hearts, but now the complaints had disappeared.

Shortly after the distribution of the Monster Cores, the squad which was to take over arrived.

“Brother Wushuang, we come to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains.” The leader of the third squad had witnessed how Jian Wushuang defeated Fang Han easily, so he was very polite to Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Haha, we’ll just stay here for a month. We’re much luckier than you. Brother Wushuang, you’re so cool. You directly forced Fang Han to change his mind,” the squad leader said and laughed. “In my opinion, since you’re obviously stronger than Fang Han, you should be the command of the Seventh Army.”

Jian Wushuang responded with a faint smile. He naturally sensed the compliment in the squad leader’s words.

Just then, buzz...

They suddenly sensed a strange wave at the same time.
