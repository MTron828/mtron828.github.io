Chapter 2313 Using The Finger As A Sword

When the crowd saw Lin Yan, the smile on Zhuge Hong deepened.“Eh~ Isn’t this the young master of Lin Mansion? So the representative of the younger generation in Lin Mansion is finally willing to show himself!” Zhuge Hong mocked.

“Zhuge Hong, you were just relying on your identity as the core disciple of Dongzuo Sect. What’s there to be cocky about?”

“Haha, I just like to. So, are you not happy about it? If you aren’t, we can just have a fight here. It isn’t that I’m belittling you. However, when it comes to trash like you, I wouldn’t even be bothered if three to five of you guys teamed up,” Zhuge Hong sneered.

Lin Yan was infuriated but there was nothing he could do.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang finally spoke. “To deal with someone like you, there’s no need for Lin Yan to do it himself!”

Huh? It was then that Zhuge Hong noticed Jian Wushuang.

Judging from his appearance, Jian Wushuang would at most be fifteen or sixteen years old. At this age, Zhuge Hong wasn’t concerned about him.

“Lad, who are you?” Zhuge Hong asked solemnly.

“I’m just a sword boy under Lin Yan,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Sword boy?” Lin Yan and the crowd from the Lin Mansion were astounded.

Lin Yan especially...

Back in Incineration Moon City, he had had the intention to take Jian Wushuang on as his sword boy. However, after a quick fight, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of Sword Principle had far exceeded his imagination. This had dispelled his thoughts of doing so.

Over this period, Jian Wushuang had remained in the Lin Mansion and was absolutely a distinguished guest. Many experts in Lin Mansion who specialized in Sword Principle, held utmost respect for him. In fact, they even sought guidance from him often. How could he be a sword boy?

However, since Jian Wushuang had said so, no one could say otherwise.

“A meagre sword boy and yet you dare to be rude before me? Scram!” Zhuge Hong berated.

“Hehe. Young master Lin Yan is of exceptional status. He isn’t someone that an average joe can challenge at will. If you want to challenge him, you should at least be able to defeat me. If you aren’t even a match for me, it’d be better for you to scram first,” Jian Wushuang laughed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s right. If you don’t even dare to fight with a sword boy, you aren’t qualified to challenge young master Yan!”

“Zhuge Hong! I think it would be better if you just run along back home.”

The majority of the crowd from Lin Mansion knew about Jian Wushuang’s identity and started chiming in.

Zhuge Hong was furious and his expression turned icy cold. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and said, “Alright. Let me teach you a lesson first before crushing your young master!”

Upon hearing Zhuge Hong, Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow.

Although Zhuge Hong was rather talented, he was too young. To put it bluntly, he lacked experience.

“Young master yan, how would you like me to teach him a lesson?” Jian Wushuang whispered.

“That goes without saying. Humiliate him utterly! The more ruthless the better!” Lin Yan gritted his teeth.

“Alright, I’ll just crush his confidence and make him doubt himself forever,” Jian Wushuang answered.

Lin Yan was astonished but still nodded. “Alright, but be careful! Although Zhuge Hong has a crude personality, he is strong. Moreover, there are rumors that he’s exceptionally close to the Pure Sun Realm.”

“Close to the Pure Sun Realm?” Jian Wushuang chuckled. “Nope. He’s already at the Pure Sun Realm.”

“What?”

When he said the words, it wasn’t just Lin Yan who was shocked. Everyone in Lin Mansion was astounded as well.

As for Zhuge Hong, he glanced coldly at Jian Wushuang and commented, “Your eyes are pretty sharp!”

When he finished his words, Zhuge Hong no longer attempted to conceal his power. His divine power and aura rose to the level of a Pure Sun Realm rapidly.

“Pure Sun Realm!”

“He’s really at the Pure Sun Realm!”

“Oh gosh! Isn’t Zhuge Hong just twenty years old? A twenty-year-old Pure Sun Realm?”

The crowd at Lin Mansion was astounded.

The spiritual influence of heaven and earth was too dense in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Cultivators that were born in this environment would naturally have greater talents.

Even so, a twenty-year-old Pure Sun Realm was an exceptionally rare talent. He would be considered a top class talent in the entire Wusha Barren Region, let alone the Anjiu Prefecture. It was not surprising that Dongzuo Sect would place such a high emphasis on Zhuge Hong.

“Is Pure Sun Realm that incredible?”

Jian Wushuang’s indifferent laughter sounded. Immediately after, a divine power that was no weaker than Zhuge Hong’s started rising around Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was undoubtedly at the Pure Sun Realm as well!

“What? ”

“How could this be possible?”

This time, even Lin Yan and many others who knew Jian Wushuang were stupefied.

Jian Wushuang was just sixteen years old. A sixteen-year-old at Pure Sun Realm!

“Brother Wushuang, how did you cultivate so quickly. Three years ago, when I first saw you in Incineration Moon City, I was the same realm as you!” Lin Yan mumbled.

What he didn’t know was that in order to not draw the attention of people, Jian Wushuang had only revealed the strength of Early Stage Pure Sun Realm.

However, he had already reached the Middle Stage Pure Sun Realm. As a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, Jian Wushuang didn’t require the divine power of a Pure Sun Realm to deal with a small lad like Zhuge Hong. Even with ordinary Transformed God’s cultivation base, he could defeat him easily. However, he would appear to be too insane then.

Facing an Early Stage Pure Sun Realm with Early Stage Pure Sun Realm would be the best.

“Tsk! I did not expect the Lin Mansion to have a cultivation talent. However, even if you could match me in cultivation base, it wouldn’t matter. One’s cultivation base wouldn’t be a complete representation of one’s fighting powers,” Zhuge Hong snorted. As he flipped his palm, a faint purple sabre appeared in his hand.

The blade was extremely thin and had an eerily cold vibe.

“Lad, show your weapon,” shouted Zhuge Hong.

“Weapon?” Jian Wushuang tittered. The next instant, he lifted his right hand and stuck out his index finger. “Against you, all I need is a finger.”

“Brazen!” Zhuge Hong was infuriated.

Even the crowd of Lin Mansion was staring at Jian Wushuang, feeling awestruck.

Although he was comparable in cultivation base, Zhuge Hong came from Dongzuo Sect and had a powerful master. The various secret skills and means he possessed weren’t what the Lin Mansion disciples could compare with. This was especially so for his compelling sabre skills. It was said that he had a grasp of the Sabre Principle.

Yet, Jian Wushuang hadn’t retrieve his sword and wished to fight with just a finger?

Was that possible?

Many Lin Mansion doubted iy. However, those who truly knew Jian Wushuang’s understanding of Sword Principle could understand. It was especially so for the powerful experts in Lin Mansion who specialized in Sword Principle.

Lin Yan was one of them. In the past, Jian Wushuang had defeated him easily with just a branch. He had even done so against Lin Yi.

Now, using a finger as a sword against the insignificant Zhuge Hong wouldn’t be a challenge.
