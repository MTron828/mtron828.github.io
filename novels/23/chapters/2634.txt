Chapter 2635: Greed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Royal Blood Gem was the king of Blood Gems.

There were rumors that only large billion catties Blood Gem mineral veins would have a small chance of finding a Royal Blood Gem.

It was extremely hard to get one Royal Blood Gem out of hundreds or even thousands of Blood Gem mineral veins under normal circumstances.

The value of the Royal Blood Gem was naturally worth far more compared to ordinary Blood Gems.

Ordinary Blood Gems were used to refine some ordinary Heavenly Treasures whereas Royal Blood Gems were used to refine Holy Treasures. It was the main refinement material for many Holy Treasures!

The bright red gem embedded in the stone wall before their eyes was a Royal Blood Gem!

“This Blood Gem mineral vein not only has more than three billion catties of Blood Gems but also produced a Royal Blood Gem?” Jian Wushuang was secretly admiring the gem before turning around and asked, “Who’s the first to discover this gem?”

A First-class Divine Demon in the mine immediately stepped forward and respectfully answered, “Master, it’s me. I was the first to discover this gem.

“I initially thought this gem was the same as others with merely a darker color shade and I didn’t care too much about it. However, I found it to be far harder than ordinary gems when I was about to remove them from the wall. I will usually be able to crack an ordinary gem with just one blow of my axe while a few blows would get it off the wall. This one was different as I’ve tried chopping it a few times with my axe using all my might, but it won’t even budge and there isn’t even a crack on it.

“I immediately knew this gem was extraordinary, so I invited the commander over.”

After the First-class Divine Demon finished speaking, Cang Heng also took a step forward and softly whispered, “Master, I’ve checked that this person is telling the truth. He immediately told the Official Army to get me the moment he found this gem is extraordinary. He didn’t tell anyone about his discovery while I’ve also covered up the news. Everyone who knows about this gem is in this mine as of now.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at everyone in the mine and nodded slightly.

“Master, this gem is a rare find if I’m not mistaken and it’s probably countless times more precious than Blood Gems. Although we only have this single piece of Royal Blood Gem, its value is probably higher than the entire mineral vein. The most important matter is that we’re the only ones who know about this Royal Blood Gem. The people from Crimson Stone Fort don’t know about it yet,” said Cang Heng in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He knew what Cang Heng was trying to convey.

People are greedy—Cang Heng and Jian Wushuang were no exception.

Taking the Blood Gem mineral vein as an example, who would not be tempted by a Blood Gem mineral vein worth a few tens of billion Primordial Stones? Who would not want to own the mine?

It would require a lot of manpower to mine such a large mineral vein, hence it was impossible to hide from the Crimson Stone Fort as there was no way to drown the commotion. They had no choice but to inform the Crimson Stone Fort of its existence.

The Royal Blood Gem was a different game altogether. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He could remove that single piece of Royal Blood Gem and hide it. The Crimson Stone Fort would not be able to find out as long as he was able to shut the mouth of those people present in the mine. They would never imagine Jian Wushuang was hiding a piece of Royal Blood Gem.

The Royal Blood Gem was too rare after all with the probability of getting one in a large Blood Gem mineral vein extremely minimal.

Crimson Stone Fort had never thought there would be a Royal Blood Gem in the mineral vein and neither had it ever crossed Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Don’t worry, send someone to guard outside, and do not allow anyone to come in. Let’s take it down first before we continue talking,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Cang Heng immediately sent someone to guard outside.

They did not make it obvious, but tried to act normal and were cautious not to attract others’ attention instead.

Jian Wushuang started digging out the Royal Blood Gem.

“Master, this Royal Blood Gem is so hard. I’ve made an attempt before, but failed,” said Cang Heng.

“Leave it to me.” Jian Wushuang pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword from behind and was about to do it himself.

Hum!

The Blood Mountain Sword traced the Royal Blood Gem’s outline under the guidance of surging divine power.

The Royal Blood Gem then was cut out neatly in an instant.

“As expected.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

Although he did not cut the Royal Blood Gems directly and only cutting the ordinary Blood Gems on its edge, the neighboring Blood Gems were also affected due to close vicinity with the Royal Blood Gems—making them harder than ordinary Blood Gems. It was almost impossible to cut the gem out so neatly if one was a Peak Earth Ultimate God or even a Heaven Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang was able to do so not only due to his strength but his Blood Mountain Sword which played a great role.

The Blood Mountain Sword was his Life Divine Weapon and extremely sharp, so cutting Blood Gems was not a problem at all.

The Royal Blood Gem was pulled out from the stone wall by Jian Wushuang in just a few moments.

Due to the Royal Blood Gem’s considerably large size and also some ordinary Blood Gems that were trapped in the middle, Jian Wushuang had to divide the Royal Blood Gem into three before removing those ordinary Blood Gems to maintain its purity.

“So we have three pieces of Royal Blood Gems.”

Jian Wushuang looked intently at the three Royal Blood Gems.

Those three Royal Blood Gems were of different sizes with the smallest only the size of a thumb. However, the thumb-sized piece of Royal Blood Gems surprisingly weighed 10 catties due to its high density!

One of the remaining two pieces was the size of a baby’s fist as Jian Wushuang held it in his hand, felt its weight, and estimated it to be more than 200 catties.

The last piece was the largest and most complete form with the size of an adult’s head.

Jian Wushuang held it in his hand and estimated its weight to be more than 10,000 catties!

“Ten thousand catties of Royal Blood Gem...” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together with shining eyes.

He knows how rare and precious the Royal Blood Gem was, but had no idea how much a catty of Royal Blood Gem was worth. He was sure the value for 10,000 catties of Royal Blood Gem was much higher than the entire mineral vein.

“Master.” Cang Heng and the other two commanders enthusiastically looked at Jian Wushuang in extreme excitement.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and calmed himself.

“Come here all of you.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the Divine Demon realm cultivators.

They immediately stepped forward and were a little worried about what was going to happen.

“There are a thousand Primordial Stones in each Interspatial Ring. Take it.” Jian Wushuang handed a few Interspatial Rings to the Divine Demon realm cultivators.
