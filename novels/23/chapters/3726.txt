Chapter 3730: Vomiting Blood

No one had expected that Blood Sword Master, who was only a Principles Master, would not only be able to fight Pupil Master head-on, but he would also be able to gain the upper hand even if Pupil Master unleashed his full strength!

Blood Sword Master could no longer have the battle strength of a Ruler, but his battle strength had already surpassed most of the primary Rulers, including Pupil Master, who was a top existence among the primary Rulers, in terms of battle strength, he was clearly inferior to Blood Sword Master.

“Pupil Master, is this your strongest strength?” Jian Wushuang stared at Pupil Master with a cold gaze. “Humph, how dare you bully my Star Palace with such strength?”

“Hand over three Pinnacle True Treasures honestly, or I’ll teach you a lesson today.”

“How dare you!” Pupil Master was extremely shocked and angry.

However, no matter how shocked and angry he was, the strength Jian Wushuang displayed was indeed slightly stronger than his.

Suddenly, Pupil Master flashed a sharp light, he snorted and said, “Boy, I admit that I underestimated you and your Star Palace. I didn’t expect a monster like you to appear in the Star Palace. You’re just a Principles Master, but your battle strength is stronger than that of an ordinary Ruler!

“However, you want me to lower my head and hand over three Pinnacle True Treasures? Dream on!

“So what if you are slightly stronger than me? What can you do to me?”

Pupil Master was fearless.

He admitted that Jian Wushuang was slightly stronger than him.

However, he was only slightly stronger. He could not even suppress him, so how could he be afraid?

“You won’t lower your head, right? Then I’ll beat you until you lower your head.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. He took a step forward, and a terrifying power suddenly condensed on the Netherworld Divine Sword in his hand.

Whoosh!

He slashed out, and the void turned into chaos.

There was no sound of explosion or air explosion. At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s sword did not seem to have any terrifying power.

However...when the divine sword fell, a cold sword light mercilessly cut through space, mercilessly tearing apart everything in front of it, and mercilessly slashing toward Pupil Master.

Sword skill, fall to the Netherworld!

With one sword move, it was the blue fall to the Netherworld!

This sword move was the astonishing sword skill that had forcefully broken through the sword skill system of Di Shisan when they were fighting.

Not only was this swordsmanship extremely powerful, but it also contained a trace of the aura of the universe’s principles!

The aura of the universe’s principles was very weak at first, but after Jian Wushuang had comprehended it under the Heaven Suppression Tablet for 5,000 years, he performed it again, the aura of the universe’s principles contained in the swordsmanship was obviously much stronger than before.

The power of the swordsmanship was also much stronger than before.

The swordsmanship alone contained more universe origin of sword principle.

The level of the swordsmanship could no longer be measured by the level of the absolute art, but it was undoubtedly Jian Wushuang’s strongest move.

The strongest move was directed at Pupil Master. At the same time, Jian Wushuang used the power of the will given by the universe principles!

After all, the power of the will given by the universal principles was unique.

It could double the basic power of Jian Wushuang’s full strength!

In other words, when Jian Wushuang used the life divine power and the heaven-cleaving skill, the power of his divine power was three times that of a primary Ruler. Now, when he used the power of the will, it was six times that of a primary Ruler.

Six times, how amazing was that?

Boom!

The shocking sword light tore everything apart mercilessly.

Pupil Master seemed to have sensed the extraordinary power of Jian Wushuang’s sword. He focused his eyes and held the red long staff with both hands. The Three-Headed Demon God behind him let out a shrill roar, then the long staff suddenly enlarged and smashed straight out.

In the blink of an eye, it collided with the sword light.

Clang!

A metallic sound rang out. The moment the red long staff made contact with the sword light, it immediately changed the direction of the shocking power contained in the sword light. The Pupil Master’s entire body was unsteady, the merciless sword light continued to slash at the Pupil Master.

In the end, it slashed at Pupil Master’s divine body without any obstruction.

Pu!

A large mouthful of fresh blood violently spurted out of Pupil Master’s mouth. This fresh blood dyed the armor on his body red.

Pupil Master’s face turned a few shades paler, and his figure was in an incomparably miserable state as he retreated explosively.

This scene caused the surrounding Principles Masters watching the battle to be flabbergasted!

“He spat out blood?”

“A dignified Pupil Master fought head-on with this Blood Sword Master, and in the end, he was smashed by Blood Sword Master’s sword until he spat out blood?”

“He didn’t succeed in his sneak attack, but in a head-on fight, he defeated Pupil Master’s attack and smashed Pupil Master until he spat out blood.”

The many Principles Masters present could not believe what they were seeing.

There was nothing they could do. The scene before their eyes was simply too unbelievable.

The difference between a Ruler and a Principles Master was simply too great. Anyone below a Ruler was an ant, and this was something that was publicly acknowledged.

However, the scene before their eyes completely broke common sense. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A Principles Master was comparable to a Ruler and could even defeat a Ruler!

Did they not see that Pupil Master had been beaten until he vomited blood by Blood Sword Master?

At this moment, Pupil Master was also stunned.

“How could he be so powerful?”

Pupil Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a horrified expression.

Others did not know his strength and trump card, but he knew it very well.

After using a secret skill and three demon gods appeared around him, his strength could even fight with an Advanced Ruler in a short time.

With such strength, he was completely crushed by his opponent with his strongest strike.

Even when his opponent destroyed his attack, he was also smashed to the point that he vomited blood?

Although it was not a big deal for a Ruler to spit out two mouthfuls, and the consumption of divine power was not too great, it meant that the residual power of Jian Wushuang’s sword had hurt him.

“He defeated my attack, but the power of his sword can still hurt me?” Pupil Master’s heart was in turmoil.

After all, he was wearing the Supreme True Treasure Armor.

With the protection of the Supreme True Treasure Armor, he was still injured by the residual power of Jian Wushuang’s sword. What did this mean?

It meant that the power of Jian Wushuang’s sword was incredible.

“Only the top few Advanced Rulers could perform such a powerful attack. Blood Sword Master’s battle strength is much stronger than ordinary Advanced Rulers!”

Pupil Master’s heart finally began to tremble.
