Chapter 3554: Killing the Monster

Seeing that the monster had not returned to the ground, Jian Wushuang was ready to move. He flashed and used the Shadowless escape art to approach the monster.

“The Blood Sword Master is approaching it? What is he trying to do?” The Xue Kong Master was in the void far away. Seeing Jian Wushuang’s action, his expression became even more strange.

“Is he planning to kill the monster by himself? Are you kidding me? With the monster’s strength, it’s impossible to kill it without the battle strength of the pinnacle of the six realm.”

“Or does the Blood Sword Master have some kind of trump card that he can use to kill the monster?”

The Xue Kong Master murmured while he stared at Jian Wushuang attentively.

Although Jian Wushuang had used the shadowless escape art, Xue Kong could still sense his presence with his strength. He could clearly see that Jian Wushuang had used the shadowless escape art to quietly approach the monster. Soon…Jian Wushuang arrived near the monster, but the monster did not notice him at all.

After all, although the monster had the battle strength equivalent to an advanced sixth realm expert, its soul strength was not as strong as that of the Principles Master of the sixth realm of the void.

Moreover, because the monster’s intelligence was too low, it had almost no sense of danger.

“Is he going to make a move?” Xue Kong frowned slightly. The next moment, his pupils suddenly shrank. “He’s going to make a move!”

Sure enough, Jian Wushuang, who was already close to the monster, had already made a move with lightning speed.

Moreover, he appeared directly beside the monster and then displayed his swordsmanship.

“Swish!”

A blood shadow, like a blood-red flash, pierced toward the eye in the center of the monster’s head with a shocking piercing force.

The third move of the bloody sword skill!

When Jian Wushuang chose to attack, he activated his life divine power and the heaven-cleaving skill.

After using the heaven-cleaving skill, the power of the sword suddenly rose to a whole new level. The key was to attack suddenly. The monster did not notice it at all, but when it noticed it…the blood-red flash was less than two meters away from his head.

At such a close distance, the monster could not even dodge.

“Chi!”

The blood-red flash directly pierced through the big eye in the center of the monster and came out from the other side of the head.

“Roar!”

With a hysterical roar, the monster instantly burst into action. Two of its four thick arms held Jian Wushuang’s Absolute Shadow Divine Sword, while the other two palms violently attacked Jian Wushuang, one of the two arms was holding onto the giant Silver Axe.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and twisted his wrist in a strange way. A shocking sword essence swept out and the Absolute Shadow Sword rolled up, forming a wave of killing power that further damaged the monster’s head, it also directly shook off the two arms that the monster was holding onto the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

Then, Jian Wushuang exerted more strength with his right hand. He used the heaven-cleaving skill again, instantly bringing with it the power of an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. The sword directly cut through the monster, and the sound of the blade entering the body rang out.

The sword was as sharp as the Blood Mountain Sword. Now that Jian Wushuang was using his full strength, the sword directly cut open the monster’s head and continued to cut out, it actually cut off one of the monster’s arms.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang immediately retreated and used the shadowless escape art again. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Roar!”

Although the monster’s head was open and looked terrible, its life was not completely cut off. Instead, it was still roaring crazily, trying to find Jian Wushuang’s location, however, it could not find Jian Wushuang at all, so it could only get angry blindly.

Jian Wushuang hid in the surrounding void and looked at the furious monster.

“It’s a pity that the monster’s life core is not on its head. It seems to be in its heart,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Jian Wushuang had read the information of these monsters and knew how special they were.

The monsters in the Nine Twists Demon Cave did not have immortal bodies like human cultivators. To be exact, they had immortal bodies, but the prerequisite was that their life cores were still there.

The life cores were the core of these monsters and the source of all power.

As long as the life cores were not broken, the monsters could regenerate even if their heads exploded and their bodies collapsed. However, as long as the life cores were broken, the monsters would still die even if there were no scars on their faces.

However, because the life core was too important, these monsters protected their life cores very well. Under normal circumstances, these monsters would only put their life cores in two places, one in the middle of the head, the other place was where the heart was.

Jian Wushuang did not know where the monster put its life core, so he tried to attack the monster’s head first, relying on the shadowless escape skill and the bloody sword skill, in addition to the supreme power of his heaven-cleaving skill, he directly blew away the monster’s head, but he failed to kill it.

Since the life core was not in the monster’s head, it had to be in its heart.

After understanding this, Jian Wushuang attacked again.

It had to be said that these monster experts were true, but they were still far inferior to cultivators in many aspects, except for the strength of a direct battle.

For example, in terms of soul power, these monsters had almost no soul power at all. They relied on the simplest perception ability. However, they were very passive when they met a cultivator like Jian Wushuang, who had the ability to secretly think and move.

Now, the monster was in a rage because of Jian Wushuang’s sneak attack, but it could not find Jian Wushuang at all, so it had nowhere to vent its anger.

Until Jian Wushuang attacked again...whoosh!

The sword light swept out, and the heaven-cleaving skill was used again, slashing toward the monster from the side.

This time, the monster was on guard and reacted in an instant. The arm holding the giant Silver Axe slashed out angrily.

It did not use any axe skill, but simply relied on its own brute force.

Jian Wushuang, who had used the heaven-cleaving skill, was definitely stronger than the monster.

Bang!

A low sound of collision was heard. The giant Silver Axe was thrown away, and the monster was also sent flying.

“I won’t stop until I die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, and a shocking destructive will suddenly rose up. He slashed the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword directly at the monster’s chest, which was where its heart was.

With a sense of hatred, he slashed at the monster’s chest. The shocking power transmitted into the monster’s body and instantly shattered its life nucleus.
