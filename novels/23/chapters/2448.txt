Chapter 2449: Hidden Cards

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“So, you want me to join forces with you?” Hong Luo’s attention was piqued.

“Yes, Long Zishan could only suffer in silence if both of us join forces as there’s nothing he can do to us, even if we snatch Jian Wushuang’s head from the Great Compassion Sect. What do you think, Hong Luo?” Huan Chen smiled.

“I refuse.” Hong Luo curtly shook her head.

Huan Chen’s and Huo Yang’s complexion changed.

“Hong Luo, are you worried about the Great Compassion Sect?” Huo Yang asked quizzically.

“The Great Compassion Sect is rich, so they don’t care about the bounty. They just want to kill Jian Wushuang, avenge Pang Tao, and save their faces. As for whether Jian Wushuang died in their hands, it doesn’t really matter. We may irritate Long Zishan if we do this, but we’ll never rub the Great Compassion Sect wrongly. You don’t have to worry about it,” said Huan Che.

“I refuse to join not because I’m worried about offending the Great Compassionate Sect, but I’ve never wanted to attack Jian Wushuang,” said Hong Luo.

“What?” Huan Chen and Huo Yang were startled.

“Well, Jian Wushuang did nothing to provoke me and none of our sect’s disciples was killed. Why should I kill him? Just for the bounty? Sorry, I’m not very interested in those rewards,” said Hong Luo bluntly.

“If this is the case, so be it.”

Huan Chen and Huo Yang no longer lingered around and left.

Hong Luo could not help but sneer in her heart as she glanced at Huan Chen’s back. “What a hypocrite. He’s polite to everyone on the surface but secretly is as cunning as a fox. Who knows what will happen if I were to join forces with him.”

Hong Luo could read Huan Chen like an open book.

There were so many genius disciples in the Saint’s Tomb that Hong Luo was spoiled with choices. Even if she was to join forces with someone, she would have never considered Huan Chen. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Of course, Huan Chen’s behavior was not the only reason Hong Luo refused, but the most important point was she never wanted to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang is simply a super monster. I’m afraid that’s unprecedented in the Wusha Wilderness. Although he has become a target for many and seems to be cornered, yet judging from his expressions and demeanors, he’s not panicking or nervous in the slightest. Instead, he is still wearing a confident appearance...” Hong Luo squinted slightly, not wanting to miss a single expression on Jian Wushuang’s face.

“He could maintain such calmness and confidence even in such a crisis. He must be either an idiot who does not know the complexity of the world or still has a stronger trump card in his hand. It would be good if he died here. However, if he is to survive after this disaster, there will no longer be any sects in Wusha Wilderness that can threaten him. Instead, those sects will be shivering because they have got on his wrong side in Saint’s Tomb.”

I better stay away from such a monster.”

Hong Luo was extremely good at reading people or rather very intuitive.

Her instinct told her that she must not rub Jian Wushuang on the wrong side.

The war continued on the battlefield.

Those Great Compassion Sect’s six disciples... Long Zishan who ranked third among the Twelve Minor Kings, was considered one of the top Peak Divine Demons.

His divine powers were extremely pure and his spear skills were remarkable. Jian Wushuang was completely not his match if they were to fight head-on.

On the one hand, Yu Aoqing was controlling two domains to completely limit Jian Wushuang’s speed while at the same time, she was playing her skills and speed to their best. Her body was moving like a phantom, repeatedly appearing behind or beside Jian Wushuang when he was fighting against Long Zishan. Her dagger stabbed out over and over again. It could have easily caused Jian Wushuang a fatal injury if he was not careful.

Lastly, there were the Great Compassion Sect’s other four First-Class Divine Demons.

Initially, those four First-Class Divine Demons were Jian Wushuang’s easiest opponents to deal with as he could rely on his speed to break their attacks previously.

However, as the four disciples formed the Four Elephant Formation which was capable of both attack and defense, they had become extremely powerful, putting a large amount of pressure on Jian Wushuang.

Under the six’s siege, Jian Wushuang gradually lost support and his defeat seemed to be a foregone conclusion.

“Jian Wushuang. I thought your strength was amazing before, but it seems that it’s nothing great now. As long as we restrict your speed, you’ll not be able to fully display your strength and sword techniques. I see that you have a merely average Peak Divine Demon Realm combat strength. I’m afraid there was only an element of luck when you killed Senior Brother Pang Tao earlier.”

You will die today without a doubt!”

Long Zishan’s sarcastic voice echoing within the space as his attacks towards Jian Wushuang with his spear was getting more swift and abhorrent.

Jian Wushuang was wielding his sword with one hand and with his somewhat solemn complexion. Under the suppression of two domains, his speed was hampered such that even his strength was greatly reduced. It was tough for him to face six opponents at the same time.

“Young man, what are you going to do next?”

In that hidden independent space, the Crimson Stone Saint was observing his battle.

He did not think that Jian Wushuang had been driven to a desperate situation.

He could see that Jian Wushuang’s composure remained calm since the beginning, without a trace of irritation.

“Now, show me what you’ve got.” The Crimson Stone Saint was anticipating.

Jian Wushuang sighed helplessly on the battlefield.

“Old man, looks like you’re getting what you want,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Of course, he was addressing the Crimson Stone Saint.

He knew all along what Crimson Stone Saint’s objective was and being placed in such a situation, he had no choice but to show his cards.

Otherwise, not mentioning the many sects’ disciples still hovering around and ready to take action against him at any time, even his fight against the Great Compassion Sect’s six disciples before him was proving to be difficult.

“Oh well, look closely since you want to see my cards. I wonder if you have the vision of Mu Xiaoxiao,” sneered Jian Wushuang. At that instance...

Boom!

The Stellar Strength within Jian Wushuang’s body exploded.

The Stellar Secret Technique was awakened.

The Stellar Strength had long been integrated into his body’s divine powers and even his blood. Now that he had released its strength, his divine powers instantly began to change.

Everyone was keeping an eye on Jian Wushuang in the middle of the battlefield.

Huan Chen and Huo Yang were ready to take action.

Jian Wushuang’s aura was getting thicker at an astonishing speed under everyone’s gaze.

Previously, he was only at the Peak Chaotic Realm or perhaps Half-Step Divine Demon Realm. However, his aura was getting more and more powerful with the rapid changes he was undergoing. He had soon broken through and achieved Third-Class Divine Demon Realm.

His strength and power soared instantly!
