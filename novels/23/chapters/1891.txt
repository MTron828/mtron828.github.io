Chapter 1892: Greetings, Great Emperor

A child at the age of twelve walked out from the island.

Don’t judge the child by his looks. The aura that he gave out was unfathomable, not much weaker than the red-robed elderly.

“Sir God Hei Dan, I asked on your behalf earlier, the master is still not awake. Hence, Sir God Hei Dan, you have to wait for a little longer,” the child replied with his young and immature voice.

“Don’t worry. I’ll just wait here,” the red-robed elderly, Sir God Hei Dan smiled but didn’t give himself airs.

One should know that he had been waiting for a thousand and eight hundred years.

Sir God, an Almighty, an extremely noble position in Eternal Chaotic World. He had waited for one thousand and eight hundred years but the master of the island never once appeared. However, Sir God Hei Dan didn’t dare to feel upset because he knew clearly the true identity of the master of the island.

Forget about one thousand eight hundred years, even if it was eighteen thousand years, he had to wait patiently.

Just then… Swoosh!

A figure plunged over from afar and landed on the island. Then, it appeared next to Sir God Hei Dan.

“Please help me inform your master that Jian Wushuang from Lineage of Star would like to see him,” Jian Wushuang looked at the child and said humbly.

“Jian Wushuang? Sword Emperor?” The child revealed a surprised look.

As for Sir God Hei Dan, his body quivered in shock too.

Sword Emperor’s name was well known in Eternal Chaotic World. His name had long resounded in the experts’ ear.

The child and Sir God Hei Dan naturally knew.

“Sword Emperor, please wait for a moment. I shall go in and report immediately,” the child bowed slightly at Jian Wushuang then he turned and walked into the island.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t in a hurry but waited there.

After a while, the child walked out and stopped before Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, master has awakened. He asked for you to come in,” the child said.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked him and walked to the island immediately.

“Then, how about me?” Sir God Hei Dan asked by the side.

“Sir God Hei Dan, master didn’t say that he is going to see you. So, I will have to keep you waiting for a little while longer. Who knows? Master might summon you in after he sees Sword Emperor,” the child replied. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I understand,” Sir God Hei Dan smiled bitterly.

He had come first and he waited for one thousand and eight hundred years. However, the master of the island woke up and called Jian Wushuang first…

Of course, he didn’t dare to be upset about it. He knew that if Jian Wushuang hadn’t come, the master of the island might still be asleep.

…

On the island, the plants grew luxuriantly.

Right in the middle of the island, there was a simple thatched cottage. The cottage looked ragged and as though it was going to collapse if there was rain or wind.

“Sword Emperor, the master is waiting for you in the cottage,” a hunchbacked elder who stood in front of the cottage guided Jian Wushuang in.

When Jian Wushuang saw the hunchbacked elder, his eyes dilated in shock.

He could tell with a glance that the hunchbacked elder was an Emperor God and he was an extremely strong Peak Emperor God.

However, on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, there wasn’t any introduction about the hunchbacked elder.

“Not all the top experts in Eternal Chaotic are listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Very soon, he stepped foot into the cottage.

In the cottage, there was only a simple bed, a wooden desk and a wooden chair.

On the wooden bed, there was an evil-looking, purple-haired young man. The evil-looking young man looked cold and he smiled faintly. His smile was so enchanting.

Looking at the person before him, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and bowed politely as he greeted, “Jian Wushuang greets Great Emperor!”

Great Emperor!

That’s right. The master of the island was seated on the wooden bed. He was also the ruler of Purple Moon Sanctuary, Purple Moon Emperor!

“Get up,” Purple Moon Emperor waved and Jian Wushuang immediately stood up.

“I heard long ago that there was an unprecedented top genius in Lineage of Star. I finally get to see with my own eyes,” Purple Moon Emperor smiled. He looked friendly, “Jian Wushang, you came here today, it should be for Lineage of Star, right?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“The Master of Star Palace has passed away and Lineage of Star has lost its mainstay. Lineage of Star will definitely become a public enemy. All forces, including many experts, will come by. With the current Lineage of Star, I reckon it might be difficult to withstand,” Purple Moon Emperor said casually.

“That’s why I came here to ask for help from Purple Moon Emperor,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Help?” Purple Moon Emperor smiled faintly, “Jian Wushuang, you thought too highly of me. Sanctuary Alliance has its rules. The battle between the forces, as long as they do not take the initiative to provoke it, we Great Emperors can’t get involved as we wish. Lineage of Star has been in Purple Moon Sanctuary for so many years and we do share some relationships. Even when the Master of Star Palace was alive, he gave me many benefits. Theoretically, I should be protecting Lineage of Star.”

“But it’s not that I don’t want to, but that I can’t.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew that the Great Emperors wouldn’t get involved in the fights among various forces. At most, they would protect one of the forces due to their relationships.

Just like back then on Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Jian Wushuang had cornered Soaring Heaven King Palace into a miserable situation. Soaring Heaven King Palace had no choice but to ask Colored Glaze Emperor to get involved.

Although Colored Glaze Emperor didn’t get involved in their fights, she came out to protect Soaring Heaven King Palace. Hence, Jian Wushuang couldn’t take any action against Soaring Heaven King Palace in Colored Glaze Sanctuary. However, besides Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Colored Glaze Emperor didn’t care about anywhere else.

That was the protection given by Colored Glaze Emperor.

Lineage of Star was under the command of Purple Moon Sanctuary. Lineage of Star had been in touch with Purple Moon Emperor and they have given Purple Moon Emperor many advantages. Lineage of Star even gave Purple Moon Emperor a White Blaze Fruit Tree. Theoretically, Purple Moon Emperor really should provide protection to Lineage of Star.

Once Purple Moon Emperor provided protection, the forces and experts who had bad intentions towards Lineage of Star naturally wouldn’t dare to act hastily.

But, obviously…

“It’s because of Secret Skill of Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Secret Skill of Star Palace is secondary. You are the main concern,” Purple Moon Emperor glanced at Jian Wushuang. “You have great potential. Among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance, although there are many who are looking forward to your growth, there are also some who are not willing to see you grow. You should understand the theory behind this.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression didn’t change. He naturally understood that.

“The restrictions that the two camps set for one another formed a balance. At such a moment, if I were to stand out and take Lineage of Star under my wing, the balance would tremble. By then, Lineage of Star would be in greater danger,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“As such, Lineage of Star’s danger, I can’t get involved personally. However, due to past relationships… Elder Qian!”
