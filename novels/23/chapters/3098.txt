Chapter 3099: Strength Soared!

Jian Wushuang, who was completely immersed in the vast information, had long forgotten the passage of time.

For Jian Wushuang, what he needed to do now was to completely digest the vast information. He did not care about anything else.

The information was too vast and majestic. He did not know how long it took, but he finally completely digested the information.

At the same time, he also figured out what the information was.

It was a secret skill!

An extremely powerful secret skill.

Jian Wushuang did not know how powerful this secret skill was, but there were a lot of images contained in the information. Those images were the scenes of the secret skill, but from the images, it was incredibly powerful.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, this secret skill should not be weaker than the space-time divine skill!

“Six paths of reincarnation!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and said these words.

This was the name of the secret skill.

This secret skill was named after reincarnation, so it was obviously a secret skill related to the rules of reincarnation.

“Like the space-time divine skill, the six paths of reincarnation requires a very high level of comprehension of the rules of reincarnation. The higher the comprehension, the more powerful the secret skill will be. My comprehension of the rules of reincarnation has reached the third stage, and while I was digesting the information of this secret skill, my comprehension of the principles of reincarnation has greatly improved. Now, my comprehension of the principles of reincarnation seems to have surpassed the comprehension of the principles of space-time, and has reached the threshold of the first move of the six paths of reincarnation, Hell Dao.”

“However, although I have received the complete inheritance of the six paths of reincarnation secret skill, I only have the memory and images of this secret skill. I have to carefully study and comprehend it before I can truly master it,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang was about to get up, but suddenly his eyes widened.

“This, this is…”

A trace of dullness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, and he was also extremely shocked at this moment.

He had just been immersed in the six paths of reincarnation secret skill, so he had no idea what was happening in the outside world. However, when he came back to his senses, he immediately noticed the changes in himself.

The biggest change was his cultivation realm!

After all, when he entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, his realm was only at the level of a rank one True Saint. At most, he was at the peak of the first level.

Although his comprehension of the principles and Dao was very high, reaching the level of the Immortal Saint was not like the Divine Master level, where he could directly breakthrough by absorbing a large amount of divine power, one step at a time.

Every realm had a huge bottleneck. Therefore, even though Jian Wushuang had stayed at the level of a rank one True Saint for a long time, he had not been able to break through to a rank two True Saint. It was not that he did not look like one, but he had not found the opportunity to breakthrough.

But now, Jian Wushuang felt that the divine power flowing in his body was many times stronger than before. It was obvious that he had broken through!

And it was not as simple as breaking through from a rank one True Saint to a rank two True Saint. Instead, he had directly broken through from a rank one True Saint to a rank three True Saint!

Right, at this moment, the divine power aura emanating from his body had reached the level of a rank three True Saint!

“Rank…rank three True Saint?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was only a rank one True Saint, but in the blink of an eye, he had become a rank three True Saint?

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang immediately began to investigate his changes. Soon, he found the miniature version of the ‘golden words’ on the back of his right hand.

“The golden words are on the back of my hand?” Jian Wushuang’s expression became even more strange.

He was completely confused.

After a long while, he shook his head and said, “Whatever. Regardless of the reason, my current realm has indeed reached the level of a rank three True Saint, and my divine power is much stronger than before.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. He could feel the explosive power in his hands.

Before, he was a rank one True Saint, but because of his perfect chaotic divine body, his divine power was comparable to that of a peak rank three True Saint. But now, he was a genuine rank three True Saint, so His divine power…

Boom!

Jian Wushuang punched out, and a terrible gust of wind instantly sounded.

His fist smashed into the void in front of him, making a sudden explosion, and the surrounding world shook.

“So powerful! Although I haven’t fought with a rank five True Saint, I feel that my divine power is definitely comparable to an ordinary rank five True Saint!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with excitement.

The reason why he was not at the peak of rank five was that the further he advanced, the greater the gap in strength.

When Jian Wushuang was a rank one True Saint, his divine power was comparable to that of a rank three True Saint.

However, when he was a rank three True Saint, his divine power was only comparable to an ordinary rank five True Saint, which was already quite ridiculous.

If he used the seven-star secret skill, the Divine Punishment God, and the nine luminaries star armor, his divine power would be ten times stronger. It was estimated that his divine power would not be much weaker than that of a rank six True Saint.

“I didn’t expect that my trip to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm would not only greatly improve my comprehension of the Samsara principles and obtain the extremely powerful secret skill, the six paths of reincarnation, but also increase my realm and my overall strength by so much!” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised.

If he were to cultivate normally, it would take him at least hundreds of years, or even thousands of years, to break through from a rank one True Saint to a rank three True Saint.

But now, the time in between had been completely omitted.

“No wonder so many geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces are so eager to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. The opportunity of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is indeed incredible. I don’t know what level the opportunity I have now belongs to,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He did not know what level the opportunity he had obtained belonged to among all the geniuses who entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. But according to his own estimation, his luck should be very good.

That was because the six paths of reincarnation secret skill alone was a great opportunity in his eyes.

Buzz!

A unique will suddenly transmitted over, causing Jian Wushuang’s body and mind to tremble.

This will came from the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

“I’ve already obtained my opportunity. Do you want me to leave?” Jian Wushuang muttered without the slightest bit of regret.

Behind him, space and time swirled, and a space passage appeared out of thin air.

Jian Wushuang took a deep look at the black stone pillar in front of him.

There were 32 golden characters on the black stone pillar, but now there were only 31 left.

“Those 31 golden characters should contain great opportunities, but I don’t know who will get them in the future.”

With a faint smile, Jian Wushuang stepped into the space passage and disappeared.
