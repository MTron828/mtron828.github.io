Chapter 5463 ¬†The Master of the Broken Sword

In the past, the first batch of Inheritors were mostly powerful, but the subsequent ones were mostly peak tier 3 Emperors, with very few at the tier 4. They weren't as highly regarded as before.

Only a few Inheritors, especially those at the tier 5 Emperor level, were truly valued. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

These powerful individuals, even at the fifth tier, could rival tier 6 Emperors, earning them respect regardless of their background.

Jian Wushuang casually paid with godstones, received the broken sword, and didn't rush to leave. Instead, he inquired about the origin of the broken sword.

He vaguely remembered the owner of this broken sword.

When he entered the Heavenly Realm, this broken sword belonged to Nie Yuan, if his memory served him right.

Back then, he was puzzled. A tier 4 Emperor carrying a broken sword. Later, he learned at the Shangqing Palace that Nie Yuan was a sword fanatic who had sought his help due to matters involving his Dao Companion.

Unexpectedly, upon their reunion, only the sword remained.

Jian Wushuang had always had a fondness for practitioners of the Dao of the Sword. Seeing this cherished personal sword fall into someone else's hands and being pawned as a common treasure, Nie Yuan's fate might not be favorable.

"Friend, may I inquire about the origin of this broken sword?" Jian Wushuang asked nonchalantly.

The tier 5 Emperor returned the extra 50 million godstones obtained from the auction and, realizing Jian Wushuang's status as an Inheritor and sensing his formidable aura, dared not offend him. He honestly explained the sword's history.

The broken sword was obtained by the tier 5 Emperor in the far north from a miner. The miner had attempted to bribe powerful figures from major clans with numerous treasures, and this broken sword was just one of them.

Upon learning this, Jian Wushuang didn't delve into further questions and silently nodded.

His Thought power probed into the broken sword, detecting a familiar sword aura inside. It resembled the sword aura of the Shangqing Palace and, even more so, Nie Yuan's.

Yet, what Jian Wushuang was truly familiar with wasn't Nie Le and the Shangqing Palace's sword aura, but the smooth Sword Intent and the faint Origin Source. He was certain that this Origin Source was identical to the one within Gong Miaoyi.

Even though it was the Origin Source of the Ultimate Sword Dao, it appeared as a thin piece of paper!

Jian Wushuang had only seen this strange phenomenon within Gong Miaoyi's Origin Source. Besides Gong Miaoyi's own spatial Origin Source, there was also a thin sheet of paper Origin Source precipitating below, representing the Origin Source of the Ultimate Sword Dao.

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly, thinking, "Nie Yuan, Gong Miaoyi? Interesting!"

This could be the opportunity for his breakthrough in the Sword Dao. If Nie Yuan was Gong Miaoyi's father, he could follow this lead, search for Nie Yuan, and emulate the Sword Dao Origin Source within him.

This might accelerate his progress, possibly allowing him to break through the ninth layer of the Ultimate Sword Dao and reach its peak.

The Far North!

It seemed like he would have to embark on a journey.

The Elder Palace was in the Central Province, also known as Zhongzhou. Meanwhile, the Far North was at the northern boundary of the Northern Region, requiring him to traverse almost the entire Northern Region!

Just for teleportation, he would need to teleport hundreds of times, and there was the possibility of encountering spatial turbulence midway, making temporal transport impossible, forcing him to rely solely on flying.

A perilous journey!

However, with Jian Wushuang's current strength, there wasn't much risk. But once bitten, twice shy‚Äîhe still remembered being hunted down all the way to the lair of Guangmu Tianzun in the Northern Region Flowing State. In the end, he was captured by Bai Junwang.

"Let's focus on cultivation first!" Jian Wushuang shook his head, not dwelling on it too much.

He could put off this matter for later.

Who knew if Nie Yuan was still alive? He had to contact Qiuhuang and ask him to use his connections to inquire about the mines in the Far North.

According to some records, there were three major divine mines on the border of the Northern Region in the Heavenly Realm, and Nie Yuan's broken sword could appear in the hands of the mine guards. This indicated that Nie Yuan was probably thrown into the mines by the Elders Palace.

The environment there was exceptionally harsh, with Dao Lords being no different from ants. Even Emperors could only preserve their lives, ceaselessly mining day and night.

Those who usually go there are those who have committed an offense and were taken away by the Elder Palace.

After transmitting this information to Qiuhuang, he began to traverse the mountainous path of the Demon Sound Mountain.

As usual, this path was filled with many powerful individuals.

The narrow path proved challenging for 90 percent of Emperors.

For an average tier 4 Emperor, reaching halfway up the mountain was already commendable.

Among the disciples of Zhen Wuyang back then, those who could reach the mountainside were extraordinary individuals.

For Emperors from the Four Great Secret Realms, reaching the mountainside required the strength of a tier 5 Emperor. As for reaching the mountaintop, it necessitated combat prowess comparable to a tier 6 Emperor.

Jian Wushuang took a step, sensing the demonic sound as he steadily moved forward.

100 feet!

1,000 feet!

3,000 feet!

5,000 feet!

In the span of an hour, Jian Wushuang had reached the halfway point.

Originally, some Emperors didn't pay much attention, assuming it was just another heaven-defying Inheritor from the Grave God Mountain. However, Jian Wushuang reaching the halfway point in just an hour startled them.

Reaching halfway in just an hour‚Äîcan't even tier 5 peak-level Emperors achieve that?

It was their first time witnessing it.

Tier 6 Emperors mostly wouldn't come to Demon Sound Mountain for cultivation, attracting at most some tier 5 peak-level Emperors.

Among the tier 5 Emperors, the fastest to reach the mountaintop took three months!

It took an entire day to reach halfway up the mountain, and now Jian Wushuang had set a small record.

However, amidst the surprised gazes of these onlookers, Jian Wushuang didn't hurry to ascend. Instead, he crossed his legs and began to cultivate.

The universe's Origin Source atop the mountain was more familiar to him than anyone else because he had once devoured a trace of it.

It was a gift from Shan Jun.

Now, as he comprehended it, the process was remarkably smooth.

It provided significant assistance to his Extreme Dao.

On the half-mountain slope, Emperors seated in meditation were all of tier 4, numbering in the hundreds. Jian Wushuang found an inconspicuous spot, indifferent to the gazes of others, and began cultivating in solitude.

The advancement of the Extreme Dao was unlike the Sword Dao; it required steady accumulation.

Each Dao had to be meticulously comprehended, and the best way was to embody and emulate it.

Inside the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard within his body, his many avatars never ceased their contemplation, continuously understanding their respective Origin Source Daos.

As his strength gradually increased, the Origin chess pieces that were once unemulatable could now be embodied by him.

"Melody?"

Jian Wushuang carefully delved into the Universe Origin Source again and discovered another Origin Source Dao.

In the Universe Origin Source on the mountain, there was a complete Spatial Origin Source, with an outer layer of Temporal Origin Source.

For now, he couldn't comprehend the Temporal Origin Source.

However, from the complete Universe Spatial Origin Source, he could gain insights into many Origin Source¬†Daos.

For instance, within this Universe Origin Source, the most profound was the Dao of Melody.

"Not bad at all!" Jian Wushuang contemplated in his heart.

The effect on the half-mountain slope was somewhat diminished. This time, he rose and took faster strides than when he ascended from the foot of the mountain.

Because he had developed some immunity to the effects of the demonic melodies.

This was the benefit of comprehension ‚Äî not being obstructed by the Demon Sound Mountain.

He stayed for less than a day before setting off again.

This time, many Emperors in meditation opened their eyes and watched.

"Look, he's on the move again!"
