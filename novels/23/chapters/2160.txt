Chapter 2161 Ancient Blood Tribe

Finally, Jian Wushuang and the Emperor Beast stopped.

“What a rush!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling brightly, the Emperor Beast having fired him up.

Indeed, it was an exhilarating battle for Jian Wushuang. He showed no restraint during the fight, demonstrating his full power.

The Emperor Beast was tough as well. Although it had seemed that Jian Wushuang was on par with him during the fight, Jian Wushuang himself knew that he was at a complete disadvantage.

That was despite Jian Wushuang having already obtained the authentic Hong Jun Golden Swords, holding the Emperor Beast down.

If not for that, Jian Wushuang would have been completely crushed.

The Emperor Beast’s crimson eyes were dead on Jian Wushuang.

The Emperor Beast was furious as Jian Wushuang had killed many of his own people.

But after the battle, he knew that he could not stop Jian Wushuang.

He could not take down Jian Wushuang. Even if the entire Ancient Blood Tribe had gathered together to resist him, the chances of actually stopping him were slim.

Furthermore, he could no longer fight anymore.

The Ancient Blood Tribe was an extremely tyrannical tribe indeed.

The tribe was extremely powerful in terms of strength, speed and defence powers. But the tribe had weaknesses.

If they had no weaknesses, they would not have been a B-class exotic beast tribe during the Ancient Era.

The Ancient Blood Tribe had one obvious weakness – they had no stamina!

Beasts of the Ancient Blood Tribe consumed a tremendous amount of strength whenever they fought. An ordinary Ancient Blood Beast would only last ten breathes, whereas the formidable Ancient Blood Emperor himself could last no more than an hour.

Half an hour had already passed, and he did not have enough strength.

“Human!” the Ancient Blood Emperor spoke. He spoke with a heavy human accent.

“He talked?” But Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

The Ancient Blood Emperor’s spiritual wisdom would have already been unlocked at that level of fighting power. Perhaps the limitations of being an exotic beast prevented him from taking a human form, but he could definitely speak the human tongue.

“Human, you slaughter my people. What purpose do you have here?” Ancient Blood Emperor asked coldly.

“Slaughtering your people?”

“They came for me, I had to make my move,” Jian Wushuang replied indifferently.

“This is my tribe’s territory. Of course, we will exterminate all trespassers!” The Ancient Blood Emperor’s voice was low. “According to the agreement between my tribe and you humans, no Peak Chaotic Realm experts are allowed here! If you want to reach the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, you all need to make a detour! But you, you are a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm expert, yet even I cannot defeat you. You have broken the agreement between the tribes!”

“Human, you wish to start a war with the Ancient Blood Tribe?”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze shifted.

He had learnt a lot from the conversation.

Firstly, the crimson beasts were part of the Ancient Blood Tribe. The Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds belonged to them, and the Ancient Blood Emperor was their leader.

Secondly, the Ancient Blood Tribe had reached an agreement with the Three Emperors World humans in the past, where the human Great Emperors were not allowed inside the tribe’s territory.

Thirdly, and most importantly, the Ancient Blood Emperor had mentioned a certain Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds?

Jian Wushuang had never heard of it in the Three Emperors Worlds. But now he knew that if he wanted to reach the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds he would need to go through the Ancient Blood Tribe territory.

“Ancient Blood Emperor, I am not aware of the agreement, I did not even know of the existence of your tribe. Of course, I have no intention of starting a war with you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He was speaking the truth.

He had indeed never heard of the Ancient Blood Tribe before entering their Forbidden Grounds.

“If that is the case, please leave now, and never step onto our grounds from this moment onward,” the Ancient Blood Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang had slaughtered many of his people. If he could, the Ancient Blood Emperor would not hesitate to kill Jian Wushuang there.

Like just now, he had tried to kill Jian Wushuang without a word.

But after a vigorous battle, he realised he could not take him down, even if the whole army was gathered there. Naturally, he had to let Jian Wushuang go. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You want me to leave?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose. “No rush. Ancient Blood Emperor, I have a question. Where are this Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds you speak of? Is it within the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds?” “You do not know of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds?” Ancient Blood Emperor’s cold eyes glanced at Jian Wushuang. He was puzzled.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang had to be a leader amongst the human tribes, with his strength. Not only should he know about the place, he should be one of the few leaders of the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds! But…

Jian Wushuang did not know about the agreement either. That made the Ancient Blood Emperor suspicious of him.

“I do not know where you come from. You have killed so many of my people, and yet you still want me to answer your questions? Scram, human!” the Ancient Blood Emperor shouted. A horrifying aura was building up.

The thousands of crimson exotic beasts beside the Ancient Blood Emperor had their gaze dead on Jian Wushuang as well.

As long as the Ancient Blood Emperor ordered it, the beasts would tear Jian Wushuang up without hesitation.

“Take it easy, no need to be angry,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “I’m willing to compensate you for the people I slaughtered, but I still hope you will be willing to answer my question, if not…”

“If not what?” Ancient Blood Emperor asked coldly.

“If not, I’ll not leave this place. I’ll kill a hundred of your men every single day. Let’s see if you all can withstand that or not,” Jian Wushuang smiled cunningly.

“You dare!” the Ancient Blood Emperor immediately became furious.

“You want to try it out?” Jian Wushuang asked.
