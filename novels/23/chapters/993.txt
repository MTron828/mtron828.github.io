Chapter 994: The Dragon Heart Elixir

“Then you must’ve heard of the Golden-clothed Deacon.” Jian Wushuang pressed on his inquiry.

“The Golden-clothed Deacon?” Yuan Gang shook his head. “No, Sir. I have never heard of him. But I do know a thing or two about the Silver-clothed Deacon. It’s said that the Silver-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple used to live among the Bone Devil Clan. It was a tale so shocking that it sent ripples through the land.”

“The Silver-clothed Deacon?” Jian Wushuang muttered, his brows rose with doubt.

The Silver-clothed Deacon was simply a Rank Six Reincarnator who commanded limited authority in the Samsara Temple.

In order to locate his father, it is imperative that Jian Wushuang sought the help of the Golden-clothed Deacon.

“I am a mere practitioner of the Eternal Realm in a lesser tribe, Sir. There is only so much that I know about the Samsara Temple. But I know one might be able to supply you with more knowledge about the Temple,” said Yuan Gang.

“Who?” Jian Wushuang stared at him at once.

“The Dragon Wing Governor.” Yuan Gang replied.

“Who is he?” Jian Wushuang asked with uncertainty.

“He is the person who holds the greatest authority in this region. It was said that he wields the greatest strength around this areas, being a Rank Three Dao Master.”

“More importantly, he’s known to be a pleasant person who enjoys strong ties and connections with many allies. He is influential even amongst the warriors of the medium populations and the stronger tribes.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“There was word that he was searching for a treasure called the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit several years ago. When word of his pursuit got out, many warriors came forward to lend him their aid. There were even promises of rich rewards to anyone who is able to come forward with the treasure. Still, the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit had remained ever so elusive that none has been able to find one.”

“By any means, he is the most influential person in this region. You can ask him for information about the Samsara Temple or the Golden-clothed Deacon. He might be able to help you if he’s willing to lend you a hand.” Yuan Gang said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with hope and confidence.

Jian Wushuang had not expected that Yuan Gang would be able to supply him with information about the Gold-clothed Deacon’s whereabouts. But Yuan Gang was able to lead him to the one person who might hold the key to the information he required, this Dragon Wing Governor.

“Where is this Dragon Wing Governor now?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“He resides at the Dragon Wing City which is at the center of this region. Go along this way, Sir. The journey to the city is just a few days’ walk.” Yuan Gang pointed to a direction as he instructed.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang thanked him and asked another question. “What are your plans, now that your tribe is no more?”

“That will hardly be a problem. We can easily join other tribes by posing as lone recluses. We might not have the respect we once had, but we will survive.” Yuan Gang replied.

“Very well.” Jian Wushuang nodded gently. With a wave of his hand, he produced something for Yuan Gang. “There are some Divine Gems in this Interspatial Ring. These might be useful to you.”

Immediately, Jian Wushuang turned and left.

“Thank you, Sir.”

Yuan Gang thanked him profusely, stealing a brief glance into the contents of the Ring when it was handed to him. His face lit up at the revelation of its contents as he held it tightly in his grasp. He turned to his son.

“We will live in disguise from now on, Lei’er. Under no circumstances, you are to allow anyone to know that we are from the Heavenly Ape Clan. The truth must be kept until you wield enough strength like the great man earlier. You will then seek to exact revenge for the deaths of our family and our kin. You understand?” said Yuan Gang gravely.

“Yes, I do, Father.” Lei Hao nodded heavily.

“You will also remember for the rest of our lives the kindness and grace shown to us by the great man just now. You will seek to repay his kindness one day when you grow stronger.” Yuan Gang continued after pausing briefly.

“Yes, Father.” Lei Hao nodded again.

It was finally many years later when a warrior called Lei Hao would emerge. With the bloodline of the Heavenly Ape awakened in him, he would then become one of the greatest warriors of the Samsara Continent where he then annihilated the Bone Devil Clan as retribution for the atrocity they inflicted towards him and his clan many a great year ago.

The boy would remember for the rest of his life the kindness that Jian Wushuang had shown him. Still, Jian Wushuang was nowhere to be found when he was ready to repay him.

Going in the direction that Yuan Gang pointed to him, Jian Wushuang finally saw from afar a huge city after two days of traveling.

It was a city so large that it dwarfed even the imperial city of the Tang Empire, even though the furnishings of the city structures are a little less magnificent and handsome.

Despite the neverending conflicts and battles that ravaged the lands of the Samsara Continent, many great cities such as this one still endured strongly as ever.

The city was called the Dragon Wing City; a city which was built by the Dragon Wing Governor himself.

Conforming to how Yuan Gang had described him, it appeared that the Dragon Wing Governor indeed wielded great strength and influence.

Jian Wushuang stepped through the gates of the city and asked around for directions to the mansion where the Dragon Wing Governor resided.

“The Dragon Wing Governor lives in that mansion.”

Standing in front of the well-guarded mansion, Jian Wushuang could feel the powerful auras of the sentinels watching the mansion, counting more than five Dao Masters at least.

“Surely you have enough wits to know better than to rashly intrude upon the Dragon Wing Governor, Jian Wushuang?” The Gu King’s voice resounded suddenly.

Jian Wushuang forced a wry smile.

As the most prestigious figure in the region, it was hardly a surprise that many would travel from far and wide only to meet with the Dragon Wing Governor to solicit his aid or to make an acquaintance.

As a stranger who had just come to the Samsara Continent, Jian Wushuang had neither the standing nor the respect to command attention from the governor, especially when he wielded only the strength of the Eternal Realm. It would be nothing short of preposterous to expect that he would be immediately granted an audience with the governor, much less to request for an introduction with the Golden-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple.

“Then what should I do?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Did Yuan Gang not mentioned earlier about the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit which many had sought for only to return with failure?” The Gu King suggested intentionally.

“He did. Do you expect me to look for the Fruit and use it to secure an audience with the Dragon Wing Governor? But I have not the treasure myself.” Jian Wushuang could not help frowning.

“That is true. You don’t have Jiuqu Dragon Fruit. But you have the Dragon Heart Elixir; a concoction which was largely produced from the extraction of the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit,” said the Gu King.

“The Dragon Heart Elixir?” Jian Wushuang repeated, perplexed and bewildered.

During the siege of the imperial city of the Tang Empire more than one millennium ago, Jian Wushuang was able to chance upon the Dragon Heart Elixir. He had found it from one of the many enemies he had slain. It was also then when he had come across the Interspatial Ring and many other valuables and resources.

“Unless I am mistaken, Jian Wushuang, the Dragon Wing Governor wants the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit because he intends to brew a Dragon Heart Elixir himself.”The Gu King explained gravely.
