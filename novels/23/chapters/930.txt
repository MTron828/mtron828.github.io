Chapter 931: I’ll Break Your Arm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Emperor Leng swooped down from the stand with her killing intent fully unleashed.

The experts were all shocked to see this.

Emperor Leng, the Emperor of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, was going to make the attack herself!

“Emperor Leng!”

Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor Leng who was aiming at him. There was no horror or fear in his eyes, only determination and resolution.

He held his sword in hand. Suddenly, a token appeared in his other hand.

He then crushed the token. “Buzz!”

The destructive Sword Essence surged, a force capable of destroying everything in the world.

The Sword Essence formed a barrier with an overwhelming power, blocking Emperor Leng from coming closer to Jian Wushuang.

“This is…”?Emperor Leng looked at the source of the Sword Essence with a frown.

The top experts in the stand looked in the same direction, too.

Everyone could feel this terrifying Sword Essence.

A giant spectral image suddenly appeared behind Jian Wushuang out of the blue. This spectral image held a sword, too. The horrible Sword Essence was from this spectral image.

“This must be the third level of Sword Essence left by Sunrise Sword Emperor. It’s indeed powerful.”?Jian Wushuang clasped his hands, feeling the horrible Sword Essence.

This Sword Essence came from the token that Xuan Yi had given him.

The token contained three levels of Sword Essence, with each level being stronger than the one before it. Jian Wushuang had used two levels of Sword Essence. This was the third and final one.

If the previous two levels were just the casual creation of Sunrise Sword Emperor, then the third contained all of his strength.

Jian Wushuang also guided the Sword Essence.

“Emperor Leng!”

Jian Wushuang called out, “You don’t deserve to be Leng Rushuang’s mother!”

“I might not be strong enough to kill you with this sword, but it’s enough to… break your arm!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was full of anger. There was killing intent in his eyes.

As he moved his mind, the giant spectral image appeared behind him again.

He swung his sword in an apparently casual manner.

Everything seemed to be quiet and still.

Emperor Leng’s terror was reflected in her eyes.

She felt the terrible Destruction aura sweeping at her and she struggled to get away.

“Chi!”

The sword light ruthlessly cut through her arm, severing it from her body. Her severed limb flew out.

Her blood gushed out in the Void.

Emperor Leng was shocked.

Everyone on the drill ground was equally as shocked as they watched the severed arm falling into the pit in the drill ground.

Half of her body was drenched with blood as she stood in the Void.

Just as Jian Wushuang said, Emperor Leng lost an arm!

Emperor Leng, the Emperor of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, had her arm cut off in front of tens of millions of people!

It was the work of an Eternal Realm expert to boot!

Even if Jian Wushuang had used a special skill, it was still a feat that would shock the entire Eternal World.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m going to kill you!”

Emperor Leng screamed with anger and madness, her beautiful face contorted into a heinous expression. Her killing intent instantly skyrocketed.

Jian Wushuang, an Eternal Realm expert, had cut off her arm in front of so many people. Jian Wushuang had been a nobody to her until now.

This was an absolute shame for her!

“Kill! Kill! Kill him!”?The words echoed inside her head.

Emperor Leng readied herself to attack again.

“Humph!”

Her scoff resounded like a thunderstorm in a clear sky. It also sounded like a drum being beat in everyone’s ears.

“That’s enough, you lowly bitch!”

Out of nowhere, a giant figure in a gray coat appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

This person was very handsome and had delicate and short black hair. There seemed to be lightning flashing in his dark pupils.

He stood there with his hands behind him, exuding a superb temperament.

His unique air impressed everyone on the drill ground and in the audience.

The experts immediately recognized him.

“Emperor Xiao! It’s Emperor Xiao!”

“Emperor Xiao is one of the four emperors. He’s here!”

“It’s Emperor Xiao!”

The exclamations reverberated in the Void.

People were still grappling with shock.

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

With the swooshing sound of the wind, ten figures appeared behind Emperor Xiao one after another.

The men were all dressed in black robes men and emanated strong auras. They were obviously supreme experts at the level of Dao Masters.

Among them was Di Jing, who was very familiar with Jian Wushuang.

“Are those men the ten War Gods under Emperor Xiao?”

“Yes! The four emperors in the peak period of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land had a group of loyal Dao Masters each. Emperor Xiao was ranked second then and it was well-known that he had 10 War Gods. Each of these War Gods was a true Dao Master with incredible strength!”

“Later on, when Emperor Xiao broke off relations with Emperor Leng, a war between them broke out. Emperor Xiao was defeated and his 10 War Gods were either wounded or killed. It’s evident now that Emperor Xiao has once again collected 10 War Gods over the years!”

“Now that Emperor Xiao has come here in person and even brought his 10 War Gods, things are becoming even more interesting.”

The top experts talked with emotion.

The ordinary warriors were excited.

They were shocked to hear Emperor Xiao call Emperor Leng a lowly bitch.

Who would dare call her that? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Then, they recognized the 10 War Gods behind Emperor Xiao and became enthusiastic.

It was Emperor Xiao!

Emperor Xiao, one of the four emperors in the peak period of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, was as noble as Emperor Leng. He was also a little stronger.

Emperor Leng had defeated him many years ago.

But he was now back with his 10 War Gods!
