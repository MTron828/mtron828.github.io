Chapter 5080 The Immortal Guarding the Pass

Jian Wushuang's mouth twitched slightly, just as he was about to speak when he was interrupted by a gusty wind.

"Force?"

Both of them became alert simultaneously, their sharp gazes fixed on the swirling clouds on both sides of the road.

"Who dares to cause disturbance here?" a voice, ethereal yet steady, echoed, followed by the clear cry of a crane from within the clouds.

An ethereal but extremely calm voice resounded, followed by a clear crane cry from the clouds. R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Then, the clouds parted, and a ten-li wide Scarlet Crowned White Crane soared out, with a white-robed old man sitting cross-legged on its back.

"Quite the entrance," muttered Nan Xuan under his breath, preparing for a fight.

The white-robed old man gracefully descended and landed on the green stone road, while the ten-li wide crane transformed into a young boy upon touching the ground.

One old, one young, one tall, one short ‚Äì two Yan Immortals now stood in their way, blocking their path.

However, this was just the beginning.

Several figures broke through the clouds and descended onto the road, blocking the way.

There were five figures in total, five Yan Immortals, and with the white-robed elder as the center, they walked towards Jian Wushuang.

"Who dares to cause disturbance here?"

Nan Xuan was about to take action but was stopped by Jian Wushuang.

He then said, "We have no intention of disturbing you. We've come here only to see the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and seek comprehension."

"Comprehension? I suggest you leave. The Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo does not entertain visitors," the white-robed old man said forcefully, his voice carrying a tone of suppression.

Jian Wushuang remained unfazed and continued, "Please inform him that we only seek comprehension, and once that is achieved, we will leave immediately."

"Can't you understand words, or do you want me to expel you myself?" a burly man with round ears and a round face angrily said.

"You're asking for it!" Nan Xuan shouted coldly, unleashing a palm strike through the air.

In the next moment, the burly man with round ears and a round face let out a sudden, unconscious groan as his massive figure was sent flying without warning.

Two streams of blood traced an arc in the air before landing on the white robe of the white-robed old man.

Because everything happened too quickly, the remaining Yan Immortals did not react in time, and the burly man with round ears and a round face lay unconscious on the ground.

Without bothering to wipe off the blood on his white robe, the old man with long beard and eyebrows shouted at the top of his lungs, "Attack!"

"Be cautious and make sure to knock them out; otherwise, it'll be troublesome later," Jian Wushuang quickly advised, fearing that Nan Xuan might go too far and kill someone.

"Don't worry, I'll treat them well." Nan Xuan replied with a faint smile. His figure instantly disappeared from his spot.

Subsequently, the battle only lasted for ten breaths, and after those ten breaths, the storm settled.

Nan Xuan returned to Jian Wushuang's side and let out a sigh, "That was annoying."

Jian Wushuang shook his head helplessly. Before him, the Yan Immortals who had appeared so dignified and ethereal moments ago were now all tied up together and unconscious.

The unconscious Yan Immortals had never expected that their opponent would be a Grand Yan Immortal.

It was a near-absolute domination; as long as Nanyuan willed it, a mere flick of his finger could easily crush them.

As the group of gate-guarding cultivators, known as Guardian Immortals fell unconscious, the vast road leading to the clouds finally opened completely.

Jian Wushuang sighed in silence, then continued to move forward.

Even though there were hundreds, if not thousands, of Yan Immortals ahead, dealing with them was only a matter of time for him now.

Having once reached higher realms, how could he possibly return to square one?

Moreover, this time, he had a true Grand Yan Immortal accompanying him. Failure was not an option.

Two of the three trials had been completed, and only the final one remained!

At the end of the expansive road lay undulating mountain peaks, with endless clouds rolling and billowing.

At the summit of these rolling mountains, a suspension bridge spanned millions of miles, suspended precariously in the midst of the clouds‚Äîa breathtaking sight.

"This is truly a grand spectacle just to meet someone!"

Nan Xuan stood before the suspension bridge, feeling sentimental. "In this setting, it almost seems like a man pursuing a woman in the mortal world."

Jian Wushuang gave a faint smile. "There's much to reflect upon."

Nan Xuan smiled too. "Indeed, there is. After all, I've spent countless lifetimes in the mortal world, watching them build towering structures only to see them crumble. It naturally evokes many emotions."

"Their lives are short, and they can't even compare to the time it takes for us to take a single breath. However, they still live diligently. It's truly worth admiring."

Jian Wushuang listened quietly to his reflections, his eyes showing a hint of tenderness.

From the smallest beginnings, one can still glimpse the grand Dao.

Just like that, a Dao discussion began on the peak of the clouds.

The clouds and mist are ethereal, gathering and dispersing.

After an unknown amount of time, when the suspension bridge beneath their feet disappeared and was replaced by solid ground, Jian Wushuang finally realized that they had completed the last part of the journey without any disturbances.

"The third trial, could it be that we've passed it as well?" He still found it somewhat unbelievable.

At this moment, a clear voice rang out, "No, of course not. With me here, passing it won't be so easy!"

With the utterance of this voice, the mist quickly dissipated, revealing towering pavilions and terraces that surpassed one another, stretching gloriously into the sky.

In contrast to Jian Wushuang, there stood a young man with a bare chest, his muscular arms holding a long sword with an expressionless demeanor.

He was an Immortal of the Yan clan, cold and aloof.

He looked at Jian Wushuang and said directly, "I want to fight you!"

Nan Xuan smiled, "This kid really underestimates himself."

Jian Wushuang paid little attention to this, nodding and saying, "Alright, but before we start, let me ask you first: does the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo reside here?"

"Let's fight first!" the young man shouted and slashed down with his sword.

Nan Xuan retreated, leaving a space for this battle.

Faced with the descending sword, Jian Wushuang did not release his Invisible Sword but instead raised both hands and met it head-on.

As the sword came down, shattering the clouds for hundreds of feet, he simply sidestepped it.

The young man was a Yan Immortal, and his control over the long sword was precise, advancing step by step, relentlessly pressing Jian Wushuang.

Countless sword radiance burst forth from the sword, like a sky-covering brilliance descending.

However, Jian Wushuang only waved his arm and shattered the sword light.

Following that, he leaped forward, appearing directly in front of the young man and quietly gripping the sword with his index and middle fingers.

Ding!

With a crisp sound, the snow-white long sword broke into several pieces, leaving only the hilt.

Finger-snapping the sword in two, Jian Wushuang's face turned serious. He bent his finger and released a surge of Yan power, sending the young man flying.

The clouds shattered, and he tumbled through the air, finally crashing in front of a building.

"Huff, huff... Huff..."

He rolled over and panted heavily, "I don't believe it, let's go again!"
