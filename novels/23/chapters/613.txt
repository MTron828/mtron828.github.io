“I’m off.” Emperor Xiao nodded slightly.

“Take your time.” Jian Wushuang frowned. As far as he knew, it’d been a long time since Leng Rushuang left the Ancient World. She might just come back one day, but she didn’t stay for long and had left immediately leaving only a greeting behind.

“Anything happened?” Jian Wushuang thought.

Just now he also heard a dismal, sorrowful and helpless emotion from the zither.

Perhaps, something did happen to Leng Rushuang.

“Hey, kid. You’re worried about my daughter, aren’t you?” Emperor Xiao suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Emmm...” In a daze for a second, Jian Wushuang nodded slowly and said, “Miss Leng is a friend of mine and she helped me before, so I would obviously be concerned about her safety.

“That’s all?” Emperor Xiao took a deep look at Jian Wushuang and continued, “You’re lucky, little fellow. My daughter was born with an Icy Heart Body, with which she has been aloof by nature and barely has any emotions. Such a cold personality resulted in only a few people being able to talk with her even though she has lots of servants in the Eternal World.”

“As for friends... Since my daughter’s birth, no one has ever been recognized as her friend by her. You are the first and only one.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Leng Rushuang, since her birth, never had a single friend she talked with.

“Maybe it’s because you’ve helped her transform Icy Heart Poison in her body, or there is something on your body or a certain temperament that attracts her. Anyway, you are her first friend indeed.” Emperor Xiao said, “Little fellow, although my daughter had numerous genius pursuers in Eternal World, she never spoke with them. But you could make friends?with her. Wouldn’t it be lucky?”

“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and you must grasp it.”

Emperor Xiao’s words confounded Jian Wushuang.

It was true that Leng Rushuang was his friend, but it seemed that Emperor Xiao wanted their relationship to push forward.

“Well, let’s forget it. Now the most urgent thing is the Firmament Territory Feast.” Emperor Xiao became firm, “In two days, the Firmament Territory Feast will be held. It would be great if you can fully master the first Occult Level of World Dao before the feast. You must make a breakthrough!”

“Breakthrough?” Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

Only warriors who achieved the level of Skyscraping Realm were qualified to participate in that Firmament Territory Feast. Jian Wushuang now, however, merely attained the level of Nine-cloud Realm. Before the Firmament Territory Feast began, he naturally hoped to breakthrough and to take the first step of the Heaven-defying Four Steps.

“The first volume of Heavenly Creation Skill is only for building a perfect foundation. That Heaven-defying Four Steps is the real beginning of cultivation. Now you have already reached perfection in all aspects, and with the accumulation of these three years, your understanding of Dao has been greatly improved. It should not be difficult to take that step,”?said Emperor Xiao.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded in absolute confidence.

Now he had already reached and even exceeded the requirements of the first step.

Just in a moment, the Slaughter Body of Jian Wushuang arrived with Di Jing.

In the past three years, Jian Wushuang had made the greatest progress in World Dao. Most incredibly, he even directly obtained a thorough understanding of the first Occult Level of World Dao.

His Slaughter Dao, directed by Di Jing, had also made amazing progress. Not as fast as the World Dao, Slaughter Body has nearly obtained the full understanding of the first Occult Level of Slaughter Dao in the past three years.

Showing up together, the two Original Bodies, World Body and Slaughter Body, fused into one body. Then Jian Wushuang began making breakthroughs in the castle.

Everything went smoothly while Jian Wushuang wasn’t impeded during the process of breaking through.

Only half a day later, great changes had taken place in the body and Spiritual Power of Jian Wushuang.

Heaven-treading Realm, the first step of Heaven-defying Four Steps, had been achieved!

Stepping into Heaven-treading Realm, which corresponded with the Skyscraping Realm for ordinary Warriors, Jian Wushuang realized that there was something different between the two.

“Incredible!”

“It was incredible.”

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes full of shock.

He had previously speculated that Heaven-treading Realm, the first step of Heaven-defying Four Steps, differed from the Skyscraping Realm of ordinary Warriors. After so many guesses, Jian Wushuang was completely stunned when he knew the truth.

The biggest difference between Heaven-treading Realm and Skyscraping Realm of ordinary Warriors lay in one’s talent rather than their flesh, Spiritual Power or anything else.

Yes, it is talent!

As soon as Heaven-treading Realm was reached, Jian Wushuang immediately found that his comprehension was significantly enhanced, much higher than before at the level of Nine-cloud Realm.

At least several times, even ten times improved!

This is real talent in comprehension!

Maybe he had improved much in the period of Heaven-treading Realm. Once he took the second step Deification Realm, his talent in comprehension would be weakened, but at present he did improve. When Jian Wushuang tried to meditate on the World Dao or Slaughter Dao, he discovered that his comprehension was a good dozen times faster than before.

One day of meditation now was equal to ten days before.

Heaven-defying Realm! This is truly the Heaven-defying Realm!

Even Jian Wushuang sucked in a breath directly, and only managed to calm down after a protracted pause.

“Now it seems that Heaven-treading Realm will be my highest talent and fastest cultivation stage. I’m afraid that cultivation will not be that speedy when I take the second step in the future.”Jian Wushuang murmured.

He also knew that in Heavenly Creation Skill, any kind of unique ability would only strengthen one’s realm and would be weakened when another breakthrough occurred.

Like the first volume of Heavenly Creation Skill, the ability would be weakened once Primordial Gold Core was achieved.

“Unfortunately,?I couldn’t reach the Heaven-treading Realm three years ago. Otherwise, after three years of hard work, my strength would be improved a lot.” Jian Wushuang thought feeling regret secretly.

After completely calming himself down, Jian Wushuang came before Emperor Xiao.

“It seems that the breakthrough went very smoothly, didn’t it?” Emperor Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang with a slight smile and asked, “You’ve achieved the first step. How does it feel? Anything unique?”

Although Emperor Xiao knew the magic of Heavenly Creation Skill, he did not know what unique ability Heaven-defying Four Steps had.

Jian Wushuang hesitated for a moment, didn’t conceal anything and directly announced the truth that he had made improvements in his talent of comprehension.
