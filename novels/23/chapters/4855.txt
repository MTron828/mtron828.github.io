4857 The Envoy From the Celestial Region

Everything was too unbelievable.

It was like a dream, but it was so real that Jian Wushuang could not believe which side was the real world.

“It turns out that I really never left…”

Looking at the real scene in front of him, he suddenly realized that Di Qing and the others were not with him when he was talking to the black-robed figure in the clouds. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Could it be the eyes of this jade head that dragged me into that illusion?” Jian Wushuang was deep in thought. He reached out his hand and touched the space in front of him. The crystal cover then sank and disappeared.

His fingertips felt a warm touch, but at the same time, it conveyed a deathly stillness without the aura of life.

“Shangyang from the Eastern Capital…”

He murmured softly. The short words were as clear as if they were engraved in his mind.

Who was the black-robed figure in the illusion, and why did he say those words to him?

Could it be that Xuan Yi or Old Master had sent him to warn them?

Jian Wushuang was moved. The more he thought about it, the closer he felt he was to the truth.

Coming to the Great Yan Domain was definitely the right choice! Everything would be known here.

He reached out and retrieved the jade head that did not have any life aura. After carefully putting it into the Boyang Bottle, he breathed a sigh of relief.

In the past few years, he had unknowingly fallen into two grotesque and variegated dreamlands, which made him even more cautious.

The first time was in Great Mi Heaven, where he was inexplicably dragged into a strange illusion. The second time had just happened. Both scenes were extremely real, as if they were foreshadowing something.

Everything seemed to be unrelated, but it was like a cage that was covered in layers.

After that, Jian Wushuang left the auction house with Di Qing, Zhao Ting, and Wei Liujia. Chun Qiu and Cui Jing stayed behind to check on the sales.

The Heavenly Region where the Eternal Wushuang Auction House was located used to be called Zhi Jing, and it was the territory of a Heavenly Sect that included seven Heavenly Regions.

This Heavenly Sect was called the Celestial Region. Although it was not a top force in the vast Great Si Region, it was still a tyrant.

That Yan Immortal named Fujie, who had a horsetail whisk, had once participated in a banquet in the Heavenly Court and was later killed by Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor… He was an Elder in that Celestial Region.

There were even rumors that the Sect Master of the Celestial Region, Zhang Tian, had broken through to the Grand Yan Immortal in a few years.

As a result, the power of the Celestial Region had been growing steadily, and it had even had many conflicts with the Young Emperor’s Six Heavens Realm.

After returning to Little Lonely Heaven in the Six Heavens Realm from the auction house, Jian Wushuang hurriedly took out the jade head from the Boyang Bottle and looked at it on the table, trying to find some clues.

After that, Cheng Qing also returned to Little Lonely Heaven. He was full of joy and was holding a bulging cloth bag in his hand.

“Brother Jian, look at what I brought back for you.” He grinned and put the cloth bag on the desk in front of Jian Wushuang.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

Cheng Qing smiled secretly and opened the cloth bag, revealing a head with disheveled hair and eyes that had long lost any luster.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He recognized the head. It was the fellow who had talked back to him at the peerless auction house.

“You killed them?”

“I didn’t kill him. The Young Emperor did it himself.” Chen Qing scratched his head. “The Young Emperor said that humiliating you was the same as humiliating him, so he cut off his head and sent it to Brother Jian as an apology.”

Jian Wushuang sighed. He understood that although the boy was arrogant, it was not enough to kill him.

However, the Young Emperor had taken this opportunity to kill him and send him here as an apology for what had happened not long ago.

This brat had died unjustly.

After taking one last look at the head that had died with its eyes open, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and sent it to Chen Qing’s hand, “I understand. Find a mountain forest and bury him.”

Cheng Qing nodded, then turned around and flew out of the hall.

Di Qing then sat down, looked at him, and said playfully, “It seems that the Young Emperor treats you well.”

“It’s just an ordinary relationship,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Di Qing did not say anything more, found a place, and fell asleep.

In the battle between him and Changfu at the Great Mi Heaven, Di Qing had lost another True Life. Both his strength and cultivation realm had dropped a lot, and he would be in a weak state before he fully recovered.

He originally had nine True Lives, but now he only had seven left.

Although Di Qing did not show it, Jian Wushuang could still feel his loneliness and disappointment.

Time passed by slowly.

Dozens of days later, an emissary suddenly came to the Heavenly Palace of the Young Emperor’s Big Lonely Heaven.

The messenger was wearing a green robe, and on his chest, he used golden thread to draw the character ‘Immortal’. His posture was quite extraordinary.

He came to the Heavenly Palace and met the Young Emperor with a neutral expression.

“Your Highness, the son of our Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sect, Zhang Chen, was invited to the Eternal Wushuang Auction House half a month ago. It has been half a month since we last saw him. I wonder if Your Highness could tell us where Zhang Chen is so that we can return and give an explanation to the Sect Master.”

The Young Emperor glanced at him and waved his hand. “Get lost. He’s just a son of a Heavenly Sect. How would I know where he is?”

The green-robed envoy’s expression was calm as he cupped his hands and said, “Your Highness, you must know it. Who doesn’t know that the Eternal Wushuang Auction House was established by Your Highness? Zhang Chen’s disappearance in your territory must be related to this.”

Hearing this, the Young Emperor slowly sat up from the bed and his eyes gradually turned cold. “Wo what if the auction house is now under my jurisdiction? Do you think I’ll remember the names of some random person?”

The green-robed envoy’s expression changed slightly, and a hint of humiliation and anger flashed in his eyes. “Your Highness, Zhang Chen is the son of the Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sect, not some random cat or dog. I would like to ask Your Highness to investigate and let me return to report.”

“Are you threatening me?!” The Young Emperor stood up and his Yan power surged. The indescribable pressure made the green-robed emissary half-kneel in the hall.

The humiliation in his eyes deepened, but he did not dare to show it. “I don’t dare. It’s just that the Sect Master is too eager to see his son. If he doesn’t see Zhang Chen again, I’m afraid he will do something.”

“Do something? Are you going to be a dog for Great Mi Heaven, or are you going to confront me?”

The Young Emperor slowly came in front of him, and the sneer in his eyes became even colder. “Do you think a small sect can put pressure on me?”

“So what if I tell you? I killed him with my own hands, and his head was also chopped off. What can your Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sects do to me?”

The green-robed envoy trembled and his face turned pale. He looked up at the Young Emperor in disbelief.
