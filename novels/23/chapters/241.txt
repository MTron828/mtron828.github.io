Chapter 242: The Furious Blood Feather Tower

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the cellar of a Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace, a purple-clothed middle-aged man respectfully stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Sir, this is the most detailed information we have regarding each stronghold of Blood Feather Tower in the Tianzong Dynasty. Palace Master White ordered me to give this to you.”

“Palace Master White?” Jian Wushuang glanced at it and began thumbing through it. It didn’t take him long to finish reading it.

“Blood Feather Tower keeps a low profile. Even Golden-dragon Palace, the best at collecting information, could only find 38 strongholds?” Jian Wushuang squinted.

Of the 38 strongholds, 11 were large ones and the others consisted of insignificant small ones.

“Sir, Palace Master White asked me to remind you to be careful,” the purple-clothed middle-aged man said with respect.

Jian Wushuang could not help smiling and slowly moved his hands towards his Interspatial Ring. “The Sword Spirit of my Triple-kill Sword has just awakened, and its power hasn’t reached the peak, so it needs to kill. I’ll start with the strongholds of Blood Feather Tower.”

Using the remaining part of the day, Jian Wushuang traveled to one of the large strongholds of Blood Feather Tower.

He spent less than 15 minutes at the first stronghold and then moved on to the next one.

The strongholds Golden-dragon Palace found were spread throughout the whole Tianzong Dynasty. Although some of them were far away from each other, Jian Wushuang was an expert at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm. He could Voidwalk at an amazing speed and travel through the provinces.

Three days!

Jian Wushuang had destroyed 13 of the Blood Feather Tower strongholds in the last three days.

The five large strongholds and eight small ones practically disappeared. Most of the assassins in the strongholds were killed by Jian Wushuang, except the few that ran away.

Jian Wushuang even had killed seven Yin Void Realm experts in these three days.

Just three days.

It was a horrible massacre.

It was a crazy massacre!

Blood Feather Tower became furious.

The lair of Blood Feather Tower lay in an unknown great canyon.

In the center of the canyon, stood a grand blood-red tower. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The tower had nine splendid floors. At the top of the tower, a figure who wore a blood-red robe and a wicked blood-red mask, stood in front of a fence, with his hands behind his back. He looked out towards the boundless sky.

Two elders stood by the two sides of the figure, one with white hair and a beard, while the other had black hair and sword-like eyebrows.

“Jian Wushuang killed Ku Ya.”

The figure in the blood-red robe slowly opened his mouth and spoke in an evil tone. No one could tell if this person was male or female.

“Jian Wushuang... When I gave the Scarlet Kill Command, he was just a boy who was not even in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Our Blood Feather Tower has tried to assassinate him, but he always survived and became stronger. Now, he has even killed one of our experts in the Exceptional Yang Void Realm.”

“If he is given several years, won’t he easily destroy our Blood Feather Tower?”

“Let alone Blood Feather Tower, I’m afraid that Holy Emperor Palace will not be his match.”

No one could read the emotion from the figure in blood-red robe’s voice. The two elders behind were frightened.

“Jian Wushuang must die. We cannot give him any more chances. This time I will personally fight,” the figure in blood-red robe said.

“What?” The two elders were startled. One of them instantly spoke. “Tower Master, Jian Wushuang improved greatly, but he is not so strong that you need to attack him yourself.”

“Hum, not strong enough?” The figure in the blood-red robe snorted and looked at the elder with the black hair coldly. The elder felt as if his breath stopped, then cold sweat formed on his forehead.

“If you look down on Jian Wushuang right now, you’re really idiots. I’ve got news that Jian Wushuang did not have the upper hand when fighting with Ku Ya, because he has hidden his strength. After releasing his full power, he overwhelmed and killed Ku Ya with only one stroke.”

“He killed an expert in the Exceptional Yang Void Realm. What does that mean?”

“If both of you fight with him, do you have the confidence to defeat him? Don’t forget that Jian Wushuang has quite a few aces up his sleeve. His strength could improve at an amazing speed,” the figure in the blood-red robe said.

The two elders frowned slightly.

Blood Feather Tower had been watching Jian Wushuang for long, so they naturally knew his aces.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang had a method to greatly improve his strength in a short amount of time.

However, Jian Wushuang had not used that ability when he killed Ku Ya.

“Tower Master, Jian Wushuang knows a lot about our Blood Feather Tower. Moreover, he is sly. He often changed his direction between destroying strongholds. He is so strong that we could not catch up with him and figure out his exact position,” the elder with the sword-like brows said.

“Why shall we go looking for him? He will come to us on his own,” the blood-red robed figure said with a cold smile, “I originally planned to start this three months from now, but I have to bring it out early in order to deal with Jian Wushuang.”

“That thing?” The two elders raised their brows, with a flicker of craftiness in their eyes.

They certainly knew what “that thing” was.

“Jian Nantian has been in our hands. Now he’s useless to our Blood Feather Tower, as well as Holy Emperor Palace. Since that’s the case, let’s use him to draw in Jian Wushang.

“Go, spread the news.

“As for the date, it’s the 18th of next month. There’s a month left.

“Next month, white snow will fall. It is a good time for killing.”

The figure in blood-red robe laughed. His body was emitting a surge of natural aura which was superior to that of the Yin-Yang Void Realm, and it was as if he was a focus point for heaven and earth.

The two elders who felt his aura had a flicker of mania appear in their eyes. Then the two of them immediately left to carry out their task.
