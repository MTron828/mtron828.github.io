Chapter 2823: Had Arrived!

It was still in the center of the desolate mountain range.

Buzz!

A total of 18 underworld blood divine swords, each of which carried the vast power of the reincarnation rule, gathered together in the blink of an eye.

A brand-new black divine sword suddenly condensed. This black divine sword was five meters long, but its body was very thin, and the power of the reincarnation rule was even more terrifying. The black divine sword trembled slightly as if it was not very stable.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light.

The five-meter-long black magic sword suddenly burst out, leaving a perfect arc in the void.

It was like a beautiful black sword light passing by.

This sword light was also fascinating.

The third level of the samsara sword formation, samsara intoxication... the essence contained in this move was the same as the seventh move of the space-time sword skill, intoxication.

It was intoxicating.

Boom!

The beautiful black divine sword pierced through three mountains in front of it. Its terrifying power was earth-shaking.

After a long while, it finally stopped.

After it stopped, the black divine sword shook a little, as if it was about to collapse, but in the end, it held on. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“After practicing for one year and four months and studying it carefully for so long, I finally managed to control the third level of the samsara sword formation?” Jian Wushuang murmured with a smile on his face.

He had been staying here for one year and four months. During this time, he had practiced the sword formation countless times, but he had always failed.

He had failed countless times, but every time he failed, he became more familiar with the heavy sword formation.

But these days, he could finally use the third level of the sword formation, and the sword formation would not collapse immediately after it was used.

It could be said that he had barely managed to control the sword formation.

The reincarnation sword formation was more and more powerful. The power of the third level of the sword formation did not disappoint him. It was much more powerful than the second level.

“Previously, when I fought with the Marquis of San Yin with all my strength, his speed was slightly suppressed, and his power was even weaker. However, I was unable to use the reincarnation sword formation at that time, and I was unable to fully display my understanding of the reincarnation rule. But now, it’s different.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Now that he had mastered the third level of the Samsara Sword Formation, his power was extremely powerful, enough to confront the Marquis of Three Yin head-on.

If he combined his swordsmanship with the space-time rule and the samsara rule, he was confident that he could fight the Marquis of Three Yin.

“I’m looking forward to fighting the Marquis of Three Yin again.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but then he shook his head. “There’s no rush. I just barely mastered the third sword formation. There’s still a lot of room for improvement. I can continue to master it.”

Jian Wushuang did not think much and immediately began to master the sword formation.

Unfortunately, the Heaven Void Palace clearly did not intend to give him so much time.

“Mr. Sword One, come to Crimson Rock Castle quickly.” Yin Su’er had already sent a message.

Jian Wushuang had told Yin Su’er that he was cultivating in seclusion and would not pay attention to the outside world. Unless the Heavenly Void Army came, he should not be disturbed.

Now that Yin Su’er had sent a message to him, it meant that the Heavenly Void Army was coming.

“It’s only been a year, but the Heavenly Void Army has already arrived? It’s really fast.” Jian Wushuang sighed, although he was not completely familiar with the third reincarnation sword formation, he did not continue to practice it. Instead, he immediately went to Crimson Rock Castle.

When he arrived at Crimson Rock Castle, Jian Wushuang met Yin Su’er.

“Mr. Sword One, I have received news that the Heavenly Void Army has entered the ice field a few days ago. It won’t be long before they set foot in the territory of our Pill Sun Sacred World,” Yin Su’er said.

“Ice Field?” Jian Wushuang’s heart stirred.

After knowing that the Sacred Sundan world was about to have a great war with the Heaven Void World, he carefully checked some information about the heaven void world.

He knew that the Sacred Sundan World and the Heaven Void World were connected to each other, and the place where they intersected was the ice field.

The Ice Field was jointly occupied by the two worlds. The Heavenly Void Army only needed to cross the Ice Field to reach the territory of the Sacred Sundan world.

“I thought that the Heavenly Void Army would secretly use the space passage to appear in a certain territory of the Pill Sun Sacred World and launch a surprise attack. I didn’t expect that they would pass through the Ice Field and launch a direct attack on the Pill Sun Sacred World,” Jian Wushuang said in surprise.

Jian Wushuang knew very well that since the Heavenly Void Palace had been operating in the Pill Sun Sacred World for a period of time and had a relationship with blood thunder king, it was impossible that there was no space passage leading directly to the Heavenly Void World in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“Mr. Sword One, you don’t know.” Yin Su’er smiled.

“There is indeed a space passage connecting the two worlds. Not only has the Heaven Void World left a space passage in the sacred sun world, but the Sacred Sundan World has also left a space passage in the Heaven Void World. However, it’s not easy to activate the space passage connecting the two worlds. It’s not a big deal to teleport one or two people, but this is a war between the two worlds. The Heavenly Void Army has mobilized half of its forces and more than 1,000 experts. It’s impossible to teleport through the space passage.”

“That will consume too many resources. Even the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace might not be able to afford it.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

The farther the space tunnel was, the more expensive it would be to teleport.

It was not easy to use the space tunnel that connected the two worlds.

“We can’t rely on the space tunnel. The Heavenly Void Army can only pass through the ice field and rush toward our Sacred Sundan World. With their speed, they will arrive in less than half a month. We should go to the edge of the Ice Field and get ready to block the Heavenly Void Army in the Ice Field,” Yin Su’er said.

“Okay, I’ll inform the Sword Alliance right away.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and immediately sent a message to Elder Tong.

Because the Sword Alliance had stopped expanding, Jian Wushuang called the top experts from before.

In addition, the Divine Sword Army in the Sword Alliance had developed rapidly over the years. Although it was still only 500 people, they were all elites and powerful Divine Masters.

After all, the Divine Void Army was not entirely made up of divine masters. Most of them were divine masters. The Divine Sword Army could also have a certain amount of combat strength in this war.

It could be said that Jian Wushuang had sent out all his forces in this war.

However, the Sword Alliance was not the only one to send out all their forces, so was Crimson Rock Castle.

In addition, Crimson Rock Castle had been actively preparing during this period of time. It had invited experts from all sides and received the support of certain experts and forces in the Pill Sun Sacred World. Now that they had received Yin Su’er’s instructions, they naturally left together.

In less than a few days, many experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World had already gathered at the edge of the Ice Fields and were quietly waiting.
