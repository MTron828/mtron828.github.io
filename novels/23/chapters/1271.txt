“It’s Lei Ming. He is displaying the God-killing Shift as well as his best skill—Seven Axe Moves of Jiu You.” Universe God Wu frowned. “Universe God Qian Luan is busy fighting with me. Who else can force him to display that move among all the experts present at Scarlet Island?” “Who else could it be?”

With this thought, his eyes widened as he looked toward Universe God Lei Ming and finally noticed Jian Wushuang standing there.

“Is that him?

“But he is only a Universe Master.”

Universe God Wu was extremely amazed. Was that Universe Master the one who managed to force Universe God Lei Ming to display his best moves?

Universe God Qian Luan’s expression changed when she saw Lei Ming’s move. “Damn!?“Lei Ming is using his best move to kill Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang, get away from him!”

Universe God Qian Luan sent a warning to Jian Wushuang instantly.

On the battlefield, when Jian Wushuang saw Universe God Lei Ming’s aura rising sharply toward him, there was a glint in his eyes.

Boom!

Universe God Lei Ming and Jian Wushuang collided into each other.

The former struck out with his two big axes, displaying his best move—Seven Axe Moves of Jiu You.

There were a total of seven strikes in the move, each move more powerful than the former.

The key point of the move was to continuously add on to the power. Although this move was just at the elementary First Level, its effect was as powerful as that of an advanced First Level.

Facing this move, Jian Wushuang brandished his Blood Mountain Sword to defend himself while drawing back.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

After seven consecutive collisions, Universe God Lei Ming finally stopped his attack.

At that moment, in front of the void that had burst, Jian Wushuang stood with his sword in hand. He looked at his sleeve opening, shook off the dust on it and looked up at Universe God Lei Ming with a smile.

“The move you just executed is not bad.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed throughout the place.

The people around were stunned.

Jian Wushuang had somehow managed to take on Lei Ming’s best moves and emerge unharmed. Universe God Wu’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.

He knew very well the power behind his Seven Axe Moves of Jiu You. Even as an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven, he had to execute the moves cautiously. Jian Wushuang, a mere Universe Master, easily held off the moves.

“Jian Wushuang?” Universe God Qian Luan was as astonished as the others.

She had just told Jian Wushuang to back off.

She now knew why the commander had sent Jian Wushuang to help her.

She also knew why Jian Wushuang was so confident in battling a Universe God.

Watched by dozens of shocked eyes, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. “I’ve withstood your best move. Now, it’s time for you to take my move.”

Jian Wushuang murmured and lifted up his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Nirvana!”

As his voice rang out, a dazzling sword light full of hope and vitality suddenly rose in the air.

After reaching a certain height, it went straight to Universe God Lei Ming without meeting any obstacles.

Seeing that, Universe God Lei Ming narrowed his eyes and hurriedly struck out again with his axes, though he was extremely shocked.

Clang!

The axe in his right hand was knocked away.

The remaining power of the sword light kept flying toward his throat. He quickly put the axe in his left hand across his chest to defend himself.

Boom!

The sword light met with the axe and Universe God Lei Ming was sent flying by the impact of the force.

Using the force, he quickly set a distance between Jian Wushuang and himself. After regaining his balance, he stood far away, giving Jian Wushuang a horrified look.

“This kid almost killed me!”?Universe God Lei Ming was deeply shaken.?“Is he really just a Universe Master?”

On the island, the experts on both sides who had witnessed the scene, were all shocked.

“Bravo!”

Universe God Qian Luan let out a cry of excitement, not caring about her status as a Universe God.

“Bastard!” Universe God Wu looked grave. “Where did this Universe Master come from? How could he be so strong?”

“We’re in big trouble!”

Universe God Wu had witnessed everything on the battlefield.

The number of Universe Masters and Holy Masters on the two sides was almost the same. The only advantage Xiu State had was that they had one more Universe God. Universe God Wu had also intended to battle Universe God Qian Luan himself and let Universe God Lei Min invade the island to kill the rest of their enemies.

If there was no one who could stop a Universe God from killing, the Universe Masters and Holy Masters of Scarlet Island would be driven wild and killed off very soon.

However, he never thought that there was someone that could hold off Universe God Lei Ming and even defeat him.

Therefore, his plan turned out to be unsuccessful.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang managed to break into their side and killed most of his people.

“We can’t let it go on like this, Mr. Zhuge, stop him!” Universe God Wu immediately sent out a message.

In fact, there was no need for Universe God Wu to send the message. Mr. Zhuge, who was still in hiding, was already itching to strike as he could not suppress his fighting instincts anymore.

Boom!

A black figure, with an aura more powerful than that of Universe God Lei Ming, Universe God Wu and even Universe God Qian Luan, appeared in the void and landed on the battlefield in an instant.

The moment the figure arrived, his aura immediately engulfed the surroundings. The Universe Masters and Holy Masters who were around the area, felt a chill in the hearts. All of them stopped their moves and looked toward the black figure.

The battle paused because of the newcomer.

When Universe God Qian Luan noticed the arrival of the black figure, her expression suddenly changed.

The figure ignored all the shocked eyes and raised his head, revealing a pale, old face. The most striking thing on his face was his eyes. They were a strange green color, terrifying and chilling.

At that moment, the eyes were fixed Jian Wushuang. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Kid, how… dare you!! ”

The roar came forth from the black-robed man’s mouth, echoing around the place.
