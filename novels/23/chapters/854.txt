Chapter 855: I Have To Get It!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Only Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang, and Wang Yuan were sitting by the jade table in the garden.

“Long time no see.” Jian Wushuang calmly looked at Leng Rushuang.

“It’s been a while since we met last. Who would have expected you to progress so fast?” Leng Rushuang responded in an indifferent tone.

“Can I check the Icy Heart Poison in your body?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Leng Rushuang glanced at Jian Wushuang and nodded slightly. “OK.”

Leng Rushuang extended her jade hand while rolling up the sleeve, revealing her jade-like arm, but several spots on the arm looked extremely white and even terrible.

“As I expected, it has spread.” Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

Leng Rushuang had a huge seal inside her body, which had been suppressing the Icy Heart Poison.

However, the seal was unable to completely suppress it.

Some of the Icy Heart Poisons would slowly leak out.

In the Ancient World, Jian Wushuang helped Leng Rushuang refine a small part of the Icy Heart Poison, but now… more Icy Heart Poison had leaked out.

Jian Wushuang touched her skin and a trace of his spiritual power permeated into her body.

After the Spiritual Power swam through her body for a while, Jian Wushuang had a general understanding of her condition.

“The poison has spread out this much?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He thought the Icy Heart Poison should not have spread as far as it had.

In fact, her Icy Heart Poison had worsened to a high level over the past 100 years.

The seal was almost useless.

Once Leng Rushuang was completely occupied by the Icy Heart Poison, she would die.

“Don’t move, let me refine it for you.”

Jian Wushuang began to activate his Spiritual Power, swallowing some of the Icy Heart Poison as he had done before.

Aided by the Heavenly Creation Skill, he was able to refine part of the Icy Heart Poison.

After a while, a part of the Icy Heart Poison was successfully refined.

“It worked.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. “However, this is just a portion of the Icy Heart Poison that leaked out. The poison under the seal is much more powerful. Maybe I can refine it?”

Jian Wushuang tried to inject his Spiritual Power into the seal, and then carefully refined a small part of it.

But…

Buzz… An unprecedented chill swept over him before his entire body and mind were almost frozen.

“Impossible!”

The sharp pain made Jian Wushuang shout out.

Jian Wushuang used his mind and then his Slaughter Body appeared next to him while his World Body turned into an ice sculpture.

Shua… The ice sculpture shattered, and the World Body completely disappeared from this world.

“This…”

The Slaughter Body widened his eyes.

If he had not let his Slaughter Body escape in time, Jian Wushuang would have been killed by the Icy Heart Poison.

“It’s too strong. The Icy Heart Poison under the seal is horrible. My current ability isn’t enough, I can’t refine it unless I make a breakthrough to the Eternal Realm. No! That’s not enough. I have to be a Dao Master, that’s the only way it would be possible to refine the poison in her body!”?Jian Wushuang roared in his heart.

“Third Brother, how did it go?” Wang Yuan immediately looked over.

“Jian Wushuang.” Leng Rushuang looked worried.

“It’s nothing.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He didn’t care about the destruction of his World Body because he was able to create another.

What he cared about was the poison in Leng Rushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang spoke. “That poison, I can’t help you for now. I can only transform the poison that leaked out from your seal at most.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I understand.” Leng Rushuang nodded slightly. She had expected this.

“I haven’t seen you for a long time. Let me play for you,” Leng Rushuang continued.

She waved her hands and a Chinese zither appeared on the table.

Leng Rushuang calmed herself before she plucked at the strings.

Buzz…

A crisp sound was heard.

This tune sounded a little sad but charming.

Her music was peerless.

Wang Yuan and Jian Wushuang were intoxicated by it.

The moment the music was over, Jian Wushuang immediately stood up.

He said, “I still have something to do, so I have to go first, but I’ll come back again. Rest assured, I will definitely detoxify it for you.”

“Okay, I believe you.” Leng Rushuang still had an indifferent look.

Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan quickly left the garden.

Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped with his hands clasped, staring at Wang Yuan, “Big Brother Wang Yuan, if the poison continues to worsen, how long will she survive?”

“300 years at most.” Wang Yuan replied directly.

“What if we get the Dragon-phoenix Fruit?” Jian Wushuang added.

“With the Dragon-phoenix Fruit, we can refine a Crape Myrtle Elixir which is powerful enough to suppress her poison. Then she’ll live for another 100,000 years at least,” Wang Yuan responded.

“100,000 years?”

Even Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“That’s long enough!”

“That’s plenty of time. With my ability, I can definitely become a Dao Master within 100,000 years and then help her refine the poison.”

“But now, the most urgent task is to obtain the Dragon-phoenix Fruit!”

“I have to get it in 300 years!”

“Stellar Fog Sea? Hum, even if it is a netherworld, I’ll still have to make a trip!”
