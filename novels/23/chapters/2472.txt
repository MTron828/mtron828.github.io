Chapter 2473: Tu Qiancheng

Zhong Yi and Su Tong both quieted down.

They were trying their very best to fight for Jian Wushuang so that Narcissus Island would defend him.

However, things had been decided and they could change nothing on their own.

On the other hand, Zhuo Bing was also begging those experts from Ancient Star Temple, but their leader, a Peak Divine Demon Elder frankly told her, “Zhuo Bing, we realize Jian Wushuang is your brother, but the troubles he got himself into is too serious that even a top ten sect in Wusha Wilderness such as Narcissus Island took the initiative to abandon him. What can we do?”

Zhuo Bing ran out of ideas.

Right at that moment...

Ring!

An eye-piercing light lit up as a spatial passage formed between Heaven and Earth.

Immediately, all the expert disciples on site looked over at the spatial passage.

“Coming out?”

Waves of terrifying killing intentions rose up.

When the light faded away, a figure gradually appeared.

He was wearing a simple black robe and carrying a long sword on his back. His face was cold as he walked out of the spatial passage slowly.

The various sects’ experts started moving around in the glade and soon had the black-robed young man who just got out of the spatial passage surrounded in the middle.

Countless hateful, cold, and blood-thirsty eyes locked on Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“You devil, Heaven’s Way will not tolerate you!”

“He actually had the guts to come out from Saint’s Tomb.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Shouts filled the air of the glade.

A while ago, when Jian Wushuang was making a breakthrough, the immense pressure from his life rating was sweeping everywhere and caused the arrival of the will of Heavenly Way. Although, for whatever reason, the will of Heavenly Way faded but that scene had still been witnessed by those surrounding experts.

All of them knew the reason the will of Heaven’s Way appeared was because of Jian Wushuang!

Jian Wushuang, who just stepped out of the spatial passage and saw them. However, he was not the least bit surprised.

“As expected, all of you are waiting for me?” Jian Wushuang murmured, showing not the slightest bit of panic or fear on his face but a little smile instead.

Even if he let an army of ten thousand stands before him, he would still be calm and composed!

“You, you are Jian Wushuang!” A frosty voice suddenly filled the air.

The voice sounded cold and proud, making all the experts look over at its origins.

They saw a buff man with a crimson-colored battle blade on his back walking step-by-step towards Jian Wushuang with his arms crossed.

His pace was very slow, but every step contained terrifying power. Every step he took would cause a small treble on the ground.

There were strong energies rising from his every step. That energy became more prominent and violent as time went on.

The energy of infinite brutality and fear suddenly swept toward Jian Wushuang like a tsunami.

“He’s Tu Qiancheng!”

“The First-Ranked Genius of Wusha Wilderness has finally taken matters in his own hands.”

“Does Tu QIancheng really want to personally take action and kill Jian Wushuang?”

“Hey, Tu Qiancheng. This is a true monster you’re dealing with!”

Each of the various sects’ experts had identified the buff man.

Tu Qiancheng enjoyed a huge reputation in Wusha Wilderness.

He was widely recognized in Wusha Wilderness as the undisputed First-Ranked Genius who was ranked first of the Twelve Minor Kings.

However, following the incredible display of Jian Wushuang’s fearful abilities and talents in Saint’s Tomb, his reputation as the ‘First-Ranked Genius’ was challenged.

He stopped walking as the energy pressing against Jian Wushuang had reached its peak. Tu Qiancheng finally arrived very close to Jian Wushuang.

“Qiancheng.” Hanyun of the Great Compassionate Sect who was standing behind looked over with a frown.

“Please don’t worry, Elder Hanyun. Just leave him to me.” Tu Qiancheng smiled plainly with resounding confidence in his tone.

Hanyun’s eyesight froze for a second but did not stop him.

“Senior Brother Qiancheng, kill him and avenge Junior Brother Pang Tao!” Long Zishan shouted.

Both Hanyun and Long Zishan had absolute confidence in Tu Qiancheng.

Their confidence was based on those terrifying victory accumulations that Tu Qiancheng had obtained.

Many years ago, Tu Qiancheng killed a Peak Divine Demon with thunderous tactics and solidified his reputation as the First-Ranked Genius while he was merely a First-Class Divine Demon.

A long time had passed since then and Tu Qiancheng’s abilities had only become more powerful and he finally made a breakthrough to the Peak Divine Demon realm!

Not many people knew how strong his abilities were exactly.

However, without a doubt, there were no more than a few Peak Divine Demons and even half-step Ultimate Gods who could surpass him.

His abilities were also the absolute strongest among those sects’ experts present.

In the opinion of those many various sects’ experts, the fact that Tu Qiancheng was going to take matters into his own hands meant Jian Wushuang was already a dead man.

Even though Jian Wushuang had shown his abilities in Saint’s Tomb being very powerful and defeated a large number of First-Class Divine Demons by himself, it did not mean that his abilities were enough to withstand Tu Qiancheng.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll give you two choices.”

Tu Qiancheng crossed his arms and stared at Jian Wushuang coldly. “One, you can kill yourself. That way you could at least die prettier. As for the second choice, it would be me who does the killing. You would end up dead anyway and that would be a terrible end. Take your pick.”

“You’re giving me two choices and you ask me to kill myself? What confidence!” Jian Wushuang laughed out loud.

However, he could understand Tu Qiancheng had his prior victories as proofs which allowed him such credibilities to speak in that manner.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s Perfect Chaotic Creature breakthrough was true to every sense of the ‘perfect’ term. He had reached perfection in every aspect and was equally perfect in controlling his divine powers to the extent of not leaking even a single trace of his energy.

Just purely based on his own control over divine power energies, he could mask his true realm without relying on any secret technique to the extent that none of those Divine Demons could see through him.

No one else could tell either, that he had broken through to Divine Demon Realm and a Second-Class Divine Demon to boot.

If they knew, perhaps Tu Qiancheng would not feel as confident anymore.

“If you want me to kill myself, it would be impossible. Why don’t you just attack and I would love to see exactly how strong the undisputed First-Ranked Genius of Wusha Wilderness really is.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Well then, I shall fulfill your wish.”

Tu Qiancheng’s voice was still cold, but his right hand was already reaching for the crimson-colored battle blade on his back.

As he held on to the blade’s handle, the battle blade slowly slid out of its sheath with a slight pull.

Just as he was unsheathing...

Bam~~~

Terrifying energy suddenly exploded and filled the entire place.

It looked almost like the massive glade had turned into a boundless crimson sea in a split second.
