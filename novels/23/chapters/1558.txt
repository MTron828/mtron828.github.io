Chapter 1559: A Shocking Transformation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Real God Long Qing, Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and the Fiery King were travelling while carrying Jian Wushuang with them. After some time, they finally left the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom’s territory.

In the black void.

“We have finally come out.”

Real God Long Qing and the rest of them heaved a sigh of relief.

The Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom had Real God Jiu Gong. As soon as he discovered Jian Wushuang’s real identity, even the few of them could not get away scot-free.

“That Real God Long Qing is really very unreasonable. He actually asked for two hundred Doctrine Gems!”

“Yes. Yin Tuo, you and I are both unable to fork out two hundred Doctrine Gems. Only Real God Long Qing is able to do it.”

Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo sighed.

“Real God Jiu Gong is known for being unreasonable.” Real God Long Qing said: “After all, the Blood Demon Church is a big powerhouse within the Holy Kingdom that he controls. Without getting a green light from him, we destroyed it directly. Moreover, it’s already not too bad that he didn’t kill all of us straight away. As for the two hundred Doctrine Gems, it’s nothing.”

After sighing for some time, Real God Long Qing looked toward Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, although the mission this time around could not be completed and that you became like this as well, the three of us had done our best.”

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly, “Thank you and I’m sorry for troubling the three of you. After I get back, I will explain to Hall Master Yuan clearly. As for the rewards that Hall Master Yuan have promised previously, they will definitely be given in full.”

“Thank you very much,” Real God Long Qing thanked Jian Wushuang. After that, he left with Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo.

They only came when they were hired. Since they had already finished what they were supposed to do, they would naturally leave.

In the void, only the Fiery King and Jian Wushuang remained.

“Jian Wushuang, how did you become like this?” the Fiery King could not help but ask.

In the beginning, he had thought that Jian Wushuang became his current state as he had been poisoned by a potent poison. However, a great amount of time had passed since travelling from the Blood Demon Church to their current location. Even after that, Jian Wushuang still did not get any better. Hence, the Fiery King was anxious.

“I’m sorry, big brother Fiery King. This matter concerns a few secrets of mine and it is inconvenient for me to tell you. You only need to send me back to the Lineage of Star. At that time, Hall Master Yuan and the rest of the people will help me to resolve this matter,” Jian Wushuang said apologetically.

“All right,” the Fiery King nodded his head and he did not mind.

After all, everyone has secrets. Moreover, some secrets were extremely crazy. Hence, he would naturally not get to the bottom of Jian Wushuang’s secrets.

The Fiery King took out an airship from the outside world. After that, he began his journey to send Jian Wushuang back to the Lineage of Star from the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom.

He took tens of years to return to the Lineage of Star.

However, even though tens of years had passed, Jian Wushuang still did not get any better.

At the Lineage of Star, inside a cave that was built with special gems. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked in front of them at the white-haired Jian Wushuang who looked like an old man, their eyes squinted slightly.

If not for the special life aura of Jian Wushuang, based on looks alone, they would not expect the person in front of them to actually be Jian Wushuang!

“Fiery King, thank you for sending Jian Wushuang back this time around. I will make sure that Jian Wushuang remembers this favor,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Jian Wushuang and I belong to the same lineage. Moreover, he has rescued me from the Sky Sword Prison and I am extremely grateful to him for this. Hence, I ought to send him back and there’s nothing with regards to owing or returning favors. Now, the most important thing is his current state. I hope that your Lineage of Star is able to think of a way to get him to recover quickly,” the Fiery King said.

“Don’t worry. You can leave this matter to the Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood.”

The Fiery King nodded his head, took a look at Jian Wushuang seriously and left soon after.

Inside the cave, only Hall Master Yuan, Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang were left.

“Jian Wushuang, for you to be in this state, could it be…” Hall Master Yuan frowned and stared at Jian Wushuang.

“The Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven!” Jian Wushuang raised his head and said.

“I was right!” Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked at each other.

They knew that since Jian Wushuang’s current state was not caused by other people, the only other possibility was the Inverse Cultivation Test.

“What’s wrong with your Inverse Cultivation Test this time around?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“I am not sure either,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “Previously, after I came out of Wu Bei’s cave, my abilities were already very close to their peak. Under normal circumstances, when my abilities reached such a level, the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven should have descended. Hence, I intentionally stayed within the Lineage of Star to wait for the arrival of the Inverse Cultivation Test.”

“After waiting for a total of one thousand eight hundred years which caused my abilities in every area to reach its peak, the Inverse Cultivation Test did not show any signs of descending at all.”

“However, this time around, after I received the news from the Vientiane Tower, I set off to the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom to capture Leng Zunzhu alive. At the start, it was still quite smooth. However, at the most critical moment where I was in an intense battle with someone, the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven descended without any warning!”

“It descended abruptly?” Hall Master Yuan was stunned.

“There were actually no warnings at all?” Lei Chao was also shocked.

For the God’s Test of a normal Universe God, there would be some warnings given when it was about to descend so that the Universe God could catch the warning and know when the God’s Test would descend clearly. This would then allow them to have sufficient time to make preparations. This was what had happened to many cultivators.

As for Inverse Cultivators, although they were different from the rest, during the previous two Inverse Cultivation Tests, they had also given Jian Wushuang ample time to prepare.

However, this time, which was the third time, there were no warnings. Hence, there was no time to make any preparations.

“Back then, I was stunned as well. After all, I was in a close-quarters fight with a Void Real God. As soon as the Inverse Cultivation Test descended, my Divine Power started to weaken speedily,” Jian Wushuang’s old face turned grave, “It’s not only my Divine Power. Even my Soul power, my comprehension toward the Heaven Way as well as all the secret skills that I learnt all began to weaken.”

“Now, not even the slightest bit of my Divine Power and Soul Power remain. This is the same for my comprehension toward the Heaven Way. Hence, it can be said that the current me has been reduced to a normal person. During the journey back here, I tried to gather my Divine Power and also comprehend the Heaven Way. However, there was no effect at all.”

“Furthermore, this Inverse Cultivation Test has also caused my body to change. My body has become like a normal person’s and my hair has turned white naturally. With that, I became lifeless, which is my current state now. I also had an impression that I would live every day with no thought of tomorrow.”

“Live every day with no thought of tomorrow?” Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao became stupefied.

Jian Wushuang was originally an extremely powerful and an exceptional genius who could compete against a Peak Void Real God. However, in the blink of an eye, he had been reduced to a normal old man who had no power at all and could only live day to day with no thought of tomorrow.

This was the Inverse Cultivation Test of the Third Heaven?
