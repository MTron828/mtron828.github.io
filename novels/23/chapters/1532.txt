Chapter 1533: Scattered Stars Game With A Thousand Moves

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The dim shadow of Real God Wu Bei stood high in the sky and he was paying attention to the expressions of everyone.

“The first test is to solve this Scattered Stars Game!”

“The Scattered Stars Game was created by an extremely old Almighty. In the Eternal Chaotic World, it is extremely popular. Among all of you here, some of you must have either seen, heard of, or even tried to solve it before!”

“The rules of this Scattered Stars Game are simple. There are a thousand black chess pieces on the chessboard and this is equivalent to a thousand moves. Every move is a test. I will give all of you a hundred years’ time. After a hundred years, the person who is able to resolves the greatest number of moves will be able to obtain the White Blaze Fruit tree of this first test.”

After Real God Wu Bei had finished his speech, a small chessboard appeared in front of the Universe Gods in the open land.

Everyone had a thousand black chess pieces. For every move that was solved by the Universe God in front of the small chessboard, one black chess piece would disappear.

“Let’s begin,” Real God Wu Bei waved his hand and said.

The Universe Gods on the open land sat down in front of their chessboards with their legs crossed. After that, they entered a state of comprehension.

“Duan Lingfeng. Have you ever come across this Scattered Stars Game?” Jian Wushuang did not rush to solve the Scattered Stars Game. Instead, he looked toward Duan Lingfeng who was beside him.

“I have heard of it before. However, I have never come across it,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“Since that’s the case, I shall give you some tips. In order to solve the Scattered Stars Game, we cannot do it quickly. We need to do it step by step and also entrench ourselves in every step,” Jian Wushuang said.

Since he had resolved the Scattered Stars Game before, he had some experience and also knew of some tactics.

“Understood,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head.

In no time, the both of them had sat down in front of their own chessboards and begun to solve the chess set.

“The Scattered Stars Game…” Jian Wushuang grinned and his consciousness entered the first chess piece.

Whoosh!

The scenery changed and Jian Wushuang appeared in a pale piece of land.

The ground was filled with snow and in the front portion of the land quietly stood a white-robed figure.

When it saw Jian Wushuang appearing, it unsheathed its long sword and an extremely sharp sword headed toward Jian Wushuang’s throat.

Jian Wushuang was already prepared. With a release of his sword light, the sharp sword was destroyed.

In an instant, the first move was resolved.

“As expected, the first move is the same as the first move that I solved for the Little Scattered Stars Game back then. If I’m not wrong, the first hundred moves of this chess set should also be the same,” Jian Wushuang giggled, “Back then at Dayu Universe, I had just cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test and become a Universe God of the First Heaven. At that time, I managed to resolve all hundred moves of the Scattered Stars Game. Now, I am a Universe God of the Second Heaven and my abilities are at the top among the Universe Gods. I wonder how many moves I can resolve in a hundred years’ time?”

“Time to begin.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started to solve the chess set with all his might.

Since he had solved the first hundred moves of the chess set before, there was no need for him to waste any time. Thus, in no time, he began to solve the hundred and first move.

For the hundred and first move, Jian Wushuang could solve it easily. Moreover, he was not anxious.

He had to do it orderly and steadily so that he could accumulate the understanding of the Sword Principles continuously.

…

In the vast hall outside the cave.

“It’s the Scattered Stars Game?”

“The first test that Real God Wu Bei prepared is actually to solve the Scattered Stars Game?”

“Hmph, he wants to test out the comprehension level of those little kids.”

Many experts in the big hall were having a discussion with one another.

The Scattered Stars Game had always been a test of the level of comprehension. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In the Scattered Stars Game, one would be unable sense the existence of any doctrines. Be it doctrines that one had unlocked or the Power of Heaven Way that one had comprehended, none of them could be detected.

Moreover, Unique Skills and secret skills could not be used.

Hence, no matter how high one’s Unique Skill level was, when solving the Scattered Stars Game, he would not have the upper hand.

If one wished to solve the Scattered Stars Game, he could only rely on his own weapons and understanding.

Take Jian Wushuang as an example. As he was proficient in Sword Principles, what would be directed at him would be his understanding of Sword Principles.

Duan Lingfeng was proficient in Sabre Principles. Hence, what would be directed at him would be his understanding of Saber Principles.

For such an understanding, one would need to analyze and try to figure it out continuously while solving the moves. Naturally, the level of comprehension was the most important.

“The Scattered Stars Game is extremely advanced. Under normal circumstances, a Universe God of the Third Heaven solving five hundred moves within a hundred years’ time could be considered a top genius. However, now, Wu Bei’s cave has practically gathered all the top geniuses in the Eternal Chaotic World. As such, there should be quite a number of kids who can resolve five hundred moves.”

“Haha. With so many geniuses gathered together, resolving five hundred moves alone might no longer be considered the top. Let’s watch. There will definitely be someone among them who can solve six hundred moves. A Universe God solving six hundred moves of the Scattered Stars Game within a hundred years’ time. Only then is that considered impressive. However, we won’t know how many such monsters there will be.”

“Let’s wait and see.”

Many experts in the big hall were waiting in anticipation.

At that moment, over a hundred thousand Universe Gods in the open space of the third level of the cave were displaying their own abilities with all their might to solve the Scattered Stars Game.

The Scattered Stars Game would get more difficult as more moves were solved with the most difficult moves at the end. As everyone present was at the peak of the Universe God of the Third Heaven, the first three hundred moves were easy to them.

In just ten days’ time, most of the hundred thousand Universe Gods in the open space had solved over three hundred moves.

After one year, more than half of the hundred thousand Universe Gods in the open had solved four hundred moves.

At the four hundredth move, the difficulty level increased greatly and everyone started to slow down.

For example, Jian Wushuang, Duan Lingfeng and Xin Zhu and even the God Destroying King’s solving speed was very slow. Under normal circumstances, they would require a few days to solve a move.

Compared to them, among the Universe Gods, there was one person who was very ‘dazzling.’

This person was Zi Dongwang!

From the start, his solving speed was shocking.

He had only taken seven days to solve the first three hundred moves.

As for solving the four-hundredth move, he only used half a year’s time.

It should be known that apart from him, the Seven Universe King, who was the second fastest to solve the four-hundredth move, had used eight months’ time. As for other people, they used nine or ten months or even a year. For example, it had taken Jian Wushuang a total of one year and four months time.

Now, ten years had passed. Zi Dongwang had already solved the four hundred and ninetieth move and he was not too far away from the doorstep of the five-hundredth move.

As for the Seven Universe King, who was the closest to him, he had only solved the four hundred and eighty-second move. Moreover, it was obvious that his speed had also decreased and he was unable to compete with Zi Dongwang.

As for the people behind the Seven Universe King such as Jian Wushuang, Duan Lingfeng, the God Destroying King and Ling Luo, they were fluctuating between the four hundred and thirtieth and four hundred and fortieth move. Compared to Zi Dongwang, their speeds were obviously a lot slower.
