Chapter 174: Seven Great Golden Dragon Ambassadors

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Outside the imperial palace, in the Cloud Mountains.

A fierce selection battle had just taken place, leaving devastation everywhere.

At that moment, seven strong figures with overwhelming auras stood at the summit of one of the lofty Giant Mountains, waiting silently.

Suddenly, three dark spots appeared on the horizon and swept towards the figures.

“Here they come.”

The seven figures lifted their heads.

As the dark points grew closer, it became apparent that there were three Griffins on which Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou rode.

When they got close to the mountain summit, they jumped off the Griffins.

“Haha. Wushuang.” A cool and charismatic middle-aged man welcomed Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Your Excellency Ye?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He had known that there would be experts invited by Palace Master White and that they would be waiting for him here, but he had not known who they would be.

He recognized the middle-aged man as Ye Rufeng, whom he had previously dealt with several times.

It was Ye Rufeng who had sent him to the Dragon Palace.

“Wushuang, we meet again.” With a smile, Ye Rufeng said,”About two years have passed since our last meeting. As for that moment, I have to thank you again. Without you, I’m afraid my daughter would have been killed.”

Back then, Jian Wushuang had run into Ye Rufeng while on assignment by the Dragon Palace. Jian Wushuang had helped Ye Rufeng take care of his daughter, Ye Mei, by helping her complete the task of catching the Two-Claw Marked Golden Dragon Guard.

Ye Rufeng had been apprised by Ye Mei about what had happened during the mission and was therefore aware that Jian Wushuang had saved his daughter’s life.

“Let it go,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You saved my daughter’s life. I have to thank you,” Ye Rufeng said solemnly.

“I believe in showing gratitude through my actions. You did me a huge favor by saving my daughter’s life and I want to repay that debt. When I heard that you needed help, I came here without any hesitation.”

“Haha, thank you so much, Your Excellency Ye,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t call me Your Excellency. If you don’t mind, call me Brother Ye,” said Ye Rufeng.

“Brother Ye,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse.

“All right. Let me introduce...” Ye Rufeng brought Jian Wushuang before the other experts.

“This is Shui Minghao, the Golden Dragon Ambassador of the Golden-dragon Palace.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the well-groomed man whose eyes seemed to possess an unusual magic to make people like him at first sight.

“Mr. Shui,” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“Jian Wushuang, the first on the Earthly Dragon List, the recognized first genius in the whole Tianzong Dynasty. After the selection battle, people were discussing you everywhere and I have already heard so much about you. Today, I’m finally able to see you in the flesh.” Shui Minghao said and laughed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Those are...” Ye Rufeng introduced the other powerhouses to Jian Wushuang one by one.

Jian Wushuang soon realized something about the experts invited by Palace Master White.

Seven experts were invited by Palace Master White.

All of them were Golden Dragon Ambassadors from the Golden-dragon Palace and had marvelous strength.

Among them, three were warriors of the Profound Yin Void Realm, two were warriors of Exceptional Yin Void Realm and two were warriors of Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

Ye Rufeng and Shui Minghao were the two warriors of the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang was delighted when he realized the strength of the seven experts and felt gratitude towards Palace Master White who had invited so many strong experts for him.

Even though the Nine Emperors Sect was the top Sect in Tianzong Dynasty, they had eight warriors of the Yin Void Realm, with only one of them being a Peak of the Yin Void Realm. As for battle formation, just Ye Rufeng and the other six experts would be enough to suppress the eight Yin Void Realm experts of the Nine Emperors Sect.

In addition, there were Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou, all of whom were in the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List. All three possessed great battle strength comparable to the level of Profound Yin Void Realm. Furthermore, Jian Wushuang’s skills were well-matched to those of the warrior of the Exceptional Yin Void Realm.

It was enough to ruin the Nine Emperors Sect with such a battle formation.

The only thing they had to be wary of was the experts hidden in the Blood Feather Tower.

“Gentlemen, I’m sorry that I can’t tell you what you are going to do yet. I’ll let you have all the details once we get to the destination,” said Jian Wushuang.

Hearing that, seven Golden Dragon Ambassadors frowned but they didn’t mind.

“So, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou departed the mountain summit on their Griffins, while the seven Golden Dragon Messengers walked on air. The group moved directly towards the Nine Ring Mountain where the Nine Emperors Sect was located.

Nine Ring Mountain was located in the Tiannan Province.

It was well known that the Nine Ring Mountain was the foundation of the Nine Emperors Sect.

The Nine Emperors Sect was a genuine old sect, which had a very good reputation in Tiannan Province.

It was said that there were three Clans and four Sects, which represented the seven strongest forces in Tiannan Province. And the Nine Emperors Sect was one of the four Sects.

Ten dark spots silently floated on the Void outside the Nine Ring Mountain, overlooking the old sect which was not far off.

“That is... the Nine Emperors Sect?”

The invited Golden Dragon Ambassadors looked grave.

“Gentlemen, that’s our destination — Nine Emperors Sect,” Jian Wushuang said in a serious voice, “According to reliable news from the Golden-dragon Palace, the man who’s imprisoned in the Nine Emperors Sect is my father.”

“Ah?” All seven Golden Dragon Ambassadors looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I need your help to rescue my father,” Jian Wushuang said,”There is no doubt that the Nine Emperors Sect’s strength is very strong. Besides, it has a connection with the Blood Feather Tower. So, some top experts from the Blood Feather Tower may be hidden in the Nine Emperors Sect.”

“The Blood Feather Tower?” The Golden Dragon Ambassadors’ expressions changed.

They would have been able to manage if it were merely a fight with the Nine Emperors Sect.

Although the Nine Emperors Sect was strong, it just a first-class Sect in the region and the strongest expert in the sect was just a Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

However, circumstances would be different if Blood Feather Tower was involved. Blood Feather Tower was the greatest killer organization in the Tianzong Dynasty. The horror that this organization was capable of causing was known to all.

Anyone who crossed the Blood Feather Tower would be targeted by the organization and assassinated. Even experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm could not escape death by Blood Feather Tower’s hands.

Apart from Ye Rufeng, the Golden Dragon Ambassadors looked hesitant.

“Gentlemen.”

Jian Wushuang observed their expressions, then said, “I know what you are worried about. If you don’t want to provoke the Blood Feather Tower, I won’t force you to do so. If there’s anyone here who wants to quit, you can leave now.”

“Of course, I will be deeply indebted to anyone who stays to help me rescue my father. I will try my best to repay your help in future.”

Several Golden Dragon Ambassadors who had hesitated brightened at Jian Wushuang’s words.

Earlier, Palace Master White had promised to gift them with items such as elixirs and tomes, in exchange for their help. Although those items were welcome, they would not have insisted on getting those items.

But getting the favor of Jian Wushuang was totally different.
