Chapter 1576: Hello, Duan Lingfeng

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Burning Demon Region was left behind by an Almighty after all. It was a vast expanse.

Although Jian Wushuang knew Duan Lingfeng’s location, he required some time to rush over.

Jian Wushuang had spread his soul power across long ago to ensure no one was behind him. Then, he came to where Duan Lingfeng was hiding.

He was at a volcano made of crimson rocks. The volcano looked ordinary but in actual fact, there was a hidden mystery in it.

“Duan Lingfeng, I found it,” Jian Wushuang sent a message and informed him.

“You should have noticed the prohibition outside, right? I do not control the prohibition, you can only barge in forcefully,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“I Understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

Blood Mountain Sword immediately appeared in his hand while his body instantly barged through the prohibition before him.

Not only did the prohibition before him have a concealing function, it also had a decent force. An ordinary Void Real God would find it difficult to pass through the prohibition using force itself. However, Jian Wushuang only spent very little time before he passed through it.

In an ordinary cave dwelling after the prohibition, Jian Wushuang finally saw Duan Lingfeng.

Duan Lingfeng looked cold but he seemed to be in good condition.

“Duan Lingfeng, it is rare to see someone corner you like that,” Jian Wushuang joked.

“You aren’t ashamed to talk about me, huh? When you lost all your power previously, you probably looked more in a fix than I am now. As you’re here, I’m guessing you have recovered your power?” Duan Lingfeng pouted and asked.

“Mm, I just recovered not long ago. I heard that you were in danger so I rushed over,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and he sighed emotionally.

Luckily, he had already passed through the third inverse cultivation test. Otherwise, with his previous condition, he would be in no position to do anything if he were to find out about Duan Lingfeng’s situation.

“Oh yeah, what happened? Why did you opt to kill the core disciple of Four Symbol Mansion in Four Symbol Land itself?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Four Symbol Mansion was the overlord of Four Symbol Land.

Just like Lineage of Star in Star land.

To kill the core disciple of Four Symbol Mansion within the territory of Four Symbol Mansion wasn’t a wise choice.

“Jian Wushuang, when we first met in Ancient Star Sea, I already told you that I have an enemy. I have always been chased after by that enemy and even brought Brother Luo Yan to death. And that enemy was a huge force in a Holy Kingdom,” Duan Lingfeng started explaining.

“After I become more powerful, I returned to destroy the force. However, the one who I harbored deep-seated hatred among the force, also the Universe God who I wanted to kill the most, came to Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries long ago. I entrusted Vientiane Tower to look for this person and they finally found the Universe God in Four Symbol Land, also the core disciple of Four Symbol Mansion.”

“He’s the person you killed?” Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Lingfeng.

“Yes,” Duan Lingfeng nodded,” At first, I intended to wait and kill him when he left Four Symbol Land to wander outside. However, he reached the turning point to breakthrough and become a Real God. Hence, he didn’t plan to leave Four Symbol Land during the time but stayed back to prepare for the breakthrough. Plus, he was a genius disciple in Four Symbol Mansion. Once he breaks through and becomes a Real God, he will be a Peak Void Real God. Then, he will permanently reside in Four Symbol Mansion. By then, it would be even harder for me to kill him.”

“I have no alternative but to take action in Four Symbol Land. I seized the opportunity and killed him when he went to prepare for auxiliary treasure.”

“As for what happened later on, you should have known.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded after he heard the story.

He knew that Duan Lingfeng wouldn’t go haywire and kill a core disciple of Four Symbol Mansion in Four Symbol Land for no reason.

From what it seemed, he really had no choice.

If he were to not kill his enemy then, he didn’t know how long he would have to wait till he got the chance to kill him in the future.

“If I were him, I would definitely make the same choice,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Duan Lingfeng, your situation now isn’t great. If I hadn’t rushed here, would you be hiding behind this prohibition and waiting for death?” Jian Wushuang said curiously.

“Wait for death? Of course not,” Duan Lingfeng shook his head and his voice became deeper, “I am betting that I would already break through and become a Real God before the experts in Four Symbol Mansion found me!”

“Break through and become a Real God?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and looked at Duan Lingfeng in shock, “You’re going to break through?”

“When I was chased after, I really did see a chance to break through. Although I didn’t prepare much, I could only risk everything and try. When I am hiding behind this prohibition, I have been trying to break through and become a Real God but I have yet to. However, I have a feeling that I will definitely break through and become a Real God if you give me more time!”

“Once I break through and become a Real God, I am confident I can rush out from Burning Demon Region!” Duan Lingfengn clenched his fists.

Jian Wushuang heard this and he was astonished.

He thought Duan Lingfeng had no way out and that was why he had barged into Burning Demon Region for his final struggle.

From what it seemed, Duan Lingfeng wasn’t fighting like a cornered beast but he was cutting off all means of retreat to show his determination to push ahead and grab the chance.

“He lives up to his reputation as a top genius in Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang complimented.

“When I was behind this prohibition alone, I had to keep my guard high although I was trying to breakthrough. Hence, the efficiency of breaking through wasn’t high. But then, you’re here and it’s different now. Jian Wushuang, do me a favor. Don’t let anyone interrupt me,” Duan Lingfeng said solemnly.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile, “Go ahead and break through in peace. Let me take care of this. Unless I die, I’ll definitely not anyone disturb you.”

“Thank you,” Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang thankfully but he entered the depth of the cave dwelling to continue to breakthrough without hesitation.

He had to seize the time.

Then, Jian Wushuang left the cave dwelling and sat outside.

After he sat down, he couldn’t help but look at the cave dwelling behind him. He sighed, “I never thought that at such a crucial moment, Duan Lingfeng would have a chance to breakthrough. So impressive!”

“He’s very calm, as calm as you,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head, “You and him are very similar in this aspect. You are the same. The more dangerous it is, the calmer you are and the more likely you are?to grasp the slim chance of survival in a certain-death situation.

“True,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

He calmed down very quickly.

“This place where Duan Lingfeng is hiding is quite secretive and the surrounding prohibition is quite unfathomable. The experts in Burning Demon Region will need some more time to find this place. I should prepare myself during the wait!” There was a glimpse of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.
