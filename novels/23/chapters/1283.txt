Chapter 1284: The Present

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Dayu Palace, as an Emperor Force of Dayu World, hid in misty mountains.

Between countless and endless of mountains, Dayu Palace Sect was situated inside an extensive cave mansion.

“Master of Scarlet Island, I have told his Highness that you have arrived. His Highness, together with Lord Wu Cang, are presently on their way.” said a White Sector God within Dayu Palace.

“Lord Wu Cang is here as well?”, Master of Scarlet Island was taken aback.

“Lord Wu Cang has been residing in Dayu Palace this entire time. He seems to be working together with his Highness to come up with a strategy.” White Sector God explained.

“A strategy?” Master of Scarlet Island appeared more bewildered.

“Master, who is Lord Wu Cang?” Jian Wushuang, who was beside Master of Scarlet Island, asked in confusion.

Before Master of Scarlet Island could even opened his mouth, White Sector God has already started explaining, “Lord Wu Cang is from Snow Kingdom who is also a Universe God of Third Heaven, like our Highness.”

“A Universe God of Third Heaven?” Jian Wushuang faltered.

At his current level, a Universe God of Second Heaven would have already greatly surpassed him in terms of power. A Universe God of Third Heaven could probably kill him even with a single breath.

Without waiting for a long time in the palace, Jian Wushuang and Master of Scarlet Island soon see two figures walking in.

Amongst the two, one of them had all white hair and his movements appeared to be very sage-like.

As for the other, he was clad in a black robe, a middle-aged man sporting a messy hairdo.

“Greetings Your Highness, My Lord.”

Master of Scarlet Island, who ruled both the Scarlet Island and Dayu World, was a man with a commanding presence. Yet at this exact moment, he was giving the two people in front of him a bow.

With Master of Scarlet Island acting as such, Jian Wushuang naturally became very respectful.

“Get up.”, as the elder waved his hand, both Master of Scarlet Island and Jian Wushuang rose.

“I heard you brought a Realm treasure for me?” Master of Dayu Palace looked down at them.

“Yes.” nodded Master of Scarlet Island, “However it is not mine, it belongs to the Divine General of my Scarlet Island, Jian Wushuang.”

“Jian Wushuang? This young man of lowly status standing beside you?”, Master of Dayu Palace glanced at Jian Wushuang. Just his gaze was enough to make the hair on Jian Wushuang’s back stood all at once.

That feeling was as though all of his secrets were being exposed to the other in front of him.

“Incredible.” Jian Wushuang felt secretly amazed.

“A Universe God of Third Heaven is a real expert, even in the Eternal Chaotic World, he is a true warrior, certainly impressive.” Gu King, a parasite inside of Jian Wushuang’s body continued.

“Jian Wushuang, bring out the golden gourd.” Master of Scarlet Island commanded.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly before revealing the golden gourd all at once.

“This is the gourd?” Master of Dayu Palace scanned the golden gourd with a placid expression, seemingly indifferent.

Since he has announced the need for a Realm treasure or a form of secret skill three hundred years ago, numerous people strove to send one and another treasure. The amount of treasures received were countless but ultimately none achieved his standard. As such, he has long been exhausted by gimmicks.

Up to one hundred years ago, as long as one sends another kind of Realm treasure that was not up to standard, the Universe God of Dayu Palace would not even bother to inform him.

Today, if it was not for Master of Scarlet Island, he would not even have shown up at all.

And now, upon his arrival, he was greatly disappointed.

This is as the treasure did not belonged to Master of Scarlet Island but belonged to merely a young boy of low status, Jian Wushuang.

What kind of Realm treasure could a mere Universe Master even present?

Master of Dayu Palace no longer harbor any hope towards Jian Wushuang.

Master of Scarlet Island has obviously noticed this at this juncture and signaled to Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang simply nodded his head before pulling out the stopper on the golden gourd.

“Boom—”

Endless golden quicksand instantly burst out from the gourd, expanding across the whole palace, eventually covering the entire palace cave mansion completely.

In spite of being indifferent just a while ago, Master of Dayu Palace’s eyes immediately twinkled upon seeing what the Golden Gourd could do. “This is…the Golden Drift Sand?”

Standing beside Master of Dayu Palace, the middle-aged man sporting an untidy hairdo, Lord Wu Cang, abruptly raised his head at once. After observing the surrounding endless of quicksand for a moment, he eventually locked his sight on the golden gourd in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“This gourd, is this the Golden Drift Sand Gourd?” Wu Cang’s voice sounded a little hoarse.

“Golden Drift Sand Gourd?” Master of Dayu Palace lit up as he has obviously heard of its name as well.

The Golden Drift Sand Gourd already had significant popularity in the Eternal Chaotic World and was rather established. However, its price was astoundingly expensive.

With conservative estimate, the value of the Golden Drift Sand Gourd exceeds 600,000 Chaos Gem. In an event where one was to bump into another who need the gourd desperately, or if it was to be placed at some high-scaled auction for sale, it could even be sold up to millions of Chaos Gem.

Undoubtedly, this Golden Drift Sand Gourd is a very powerful and valuable Realm treasure.

“Brother Wu Cang, with your capability, what are the chances of succeeding if you were to exude your powers to activate the Golden Drift Sand Gourd, together with the Realm, to pass the Secret Land?” Master of Dayu Palace immediately looked at Wu Cang beside him, his eyes ablazed.

“I have only heard about the Golden Drift Sand Gourd before but have never seen it, so I am unsure of the strength of its power. However, it is immensely famous, surely its powers would not be any sub-par. Compared to the other Realm Treasures or Skill that others have sent in the last couple hundred of years, it must be a lot more powerful.”

“Given my capability, with the help of the Golden Quicksand Realm, I would have at least fifty percent chance of overcoming the test within the Secret Realm!” Wu Cang proclaimed.

“Fifty percent?” Master of Dayu Palace was overjoyed.

He and Wu Cang once coincidentally explored and found a Secret Land. The Secret Land was very unique, different from the norm and contained mysterious opportunities to be discovered.

They paid a huge price to enter that Secret Land, unfortunately, there lies a grave test within the Secret Land. Despite trying many times to pass the test, they always end in failure, ultimately having to leave.

Yet when they came back, through relentlessly studying about the Secret Land, they came to a conclusion that they would need the help of a type of Realm Technique in order to have a chance to overcome the test.

This was how the quest and word of finding a treasure circulated as Master of Dayu Palace continues to search for the treasure for many years.

Throughout several hundreds of years, Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang both mobilized their powers to search for a piece of Realm Treasure that could meet their requirement.

Yet three hundred years down the road, even with the best form of Realm Skill, they only had up to thirty percent chance of passing the test.

Now, with the help of the Golden Drift Sand Gourd, the possibility of passing the test is actually fifty percent?

Fifty percent, that is already by itself, tremendous!

This was sufficient for them to take the risk and give it a try.

After a moment of exchange between Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang, they turned around and finally set their sights on Jian Wushuang.

“Kiddy, what’s your name again?”
