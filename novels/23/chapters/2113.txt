Chapter 2114 Three Divine Lights

“Good to hear,” Red Dragon King nodded.At that moment … Wong!

A figure formed within the palace. It was Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor,” Emperor God Jue Xian immediately took a bow.

“Jue Xian, you got lucky,” Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor God Jue Xian.

Emperor God Jue Xian knew what that meant. He looked at Jian Wushuang in delight and excitement.

With a flip of his hand, the token appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hands. Emperor God Jue Xian knew what that was. It was the Heaven Repairing Palace’s token.

“I’ve discussed it with Emperor Bai and the others. You can have a seat on one condition: regardless of if you become Great Emperor or not, you will swear to fight at the forefront as our vanguard when the time to battle the Three Emperors World comes. Do you accept this?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Emperor God Jue Xian flinched.

Red Dragon King at the side laughed, “The Sanctuary Alliance has always been fair. You want something others could have possessed instead, you need to pay a higher price than them. This is normal.”

Emperor God Jue Xian nodded, and replied, “Sword Emperor, I am willing! As long as I get the chance to enter, I will do it even if it costs me my life!”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, and tossed the token towards him.

After he received it, Emperor God Jue Xian clenched the token tightly with his fists, his eyes lighting up.

The Heaven Repairing Palace, the opportunity of a lifetime!

Seeing that, Jian Wushuang nodded his head from a corner. If it were him that had reached a bottleneck as a pinnacle Emperor God, he too would have gambled everything for a chance to enter the Palace, even putting his life on the line.

Any Cultivator with the heart of an elite expert would have done the same.

Furthermore, the Emperor God had nothing to hold him down from his ambitions. Nothing was more important to him than becoming stronger.

“Emperor God Jue Xian, the Soul Attack secret skill?” Red Dragon King asked.

Emperor God Jue Xian bounced, and took out a murky grey pearl. “Sword Emperor, the secret skill lies within the pearl. In order to obtain the secret skill, you must obtain the method of inheritance from the pearl. I was unable to inherit it completely, so I was only able to learn a fraction of the secret skill.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang reacted.

Emperor God Jue Xian’s Soul Attack was already very impressive with a fraction of the skill. What if he had learnt the complete set?

“Let me try,” Jian Wushuang smiled, and held the murky pearl in his palm, his Soul Power entering it.

Information soon overwhelmed him. Jian Wushuang had started the inheritance process. As the process went on, he learned the name of the secret skill. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Three Divine Lights, it was called.

The secret skill came from the Ancient Era, created by an Ancient expert proficient in Soul Attacks.

The secret skill was split into three parts. Golden Light Scripture, Foggy Light Scripture, and Nether Light Scripture.

The Golden Light specified one-on-one Soul Attacks, concentrating all Soul Attack power to form a golden light, increasing the Soul Power’s abilities and decimating enemies.

The Foggy Light allowed for area Soul Attacks, suitable for messy battles, or when the person was surrounded by enemies. That skill delighted Jian Wushuang. With the battle against the Three Emperors World coming up, he would be able to use the skill against the countless enemies in one blow.

The last scripture, Nether Light, focused on Soul Control!

This scripture was the most powerful of them all, allowing Jian Wushuang’s Soul Control to be silent, yet deadly. The Nether Light was much stronger than the Soul Control skills he had known.

The three scriptures were entering Jian Wushuang’s memory without obstruction or resistance.

Within an hour, the process was done.

“Whew!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and exhaled lightly. He was smiling.

“How is it, Sword Emperor?” Red Dragon King looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“Not bad, this is an impressive skill, one of the best and most comprehensive Soul Attack skills I have ever encountered. It is not just good for one-on-one combat, but also area attacks. Soul Control skills will help me a lot as well,” Jian Wushuang said.

That was true.

Without a doubt, the secret skill was enough to cause substantial improvement in his Soul Attacks, allowing him to use it flawlessly during battles.

“Emperor God Jue Xian, you can have the pearl back,” Jian Wushuang tossed the pearl back to him.

Emperor God Jue Xian received it, but remained shocked. “Sword Emperor, have you inherited the entire skill?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“How is that possible?” Emperor God Jue Xian could not believe it. “When I first started learning, it took me almost a month for the Golden Light Scripture alone, the Foggy Light took me three years, and up till now I have yet to master the Nether Light … but Sword Emperor you did everything within an hour?”

“Hngh, how can you compare yourself to the Sword Emperor?” Red Dragon Emperor looked at Emperor God Jue Xian.

He laughed awkwardly, but deep down he was impressed. “He is indeed the recognised genius of the Eternal Chaotic World…”

Emperor God Jue Xian raised his head. “Sword Emperor, although you have obtained the complete secret skills, they all need constant practising for them to get stronger. I do not know much on Nether Light, but the other two can be split into four levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Master!”

“Each level will improve the secret skill’s abilities greatly.”
