Chapter 243: Bombshell

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang madly started the massacre, which aroused the attention of each force in the Tianzong Dynasty.

The experts of these forces were shocked and expected a reaction from Blood Feather Tower.

Not only were they overlords in Tianzong Dynasty, Blood Feather Tower was also an assassin organization, famous for its barbarity. Faced with such crazy provocation, Blood Feather Tower would strike back without a doubt.

As expected, on the fourth day after Jian Wushuang began the slaughter, Blood Feather Tower dropped a bombshell.

It was a blood-red invitation sent to every force in the Tianzong Dynasty.

The forces with a good reputation all received this invitation at this time.

The words on the invitation caused a sensation in the Tianzong Dynasty.

The invitation read...

“I’m Qi Luosheng, Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower, ranked second on the Heavenly Dragon List. I have been at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm for dozens of years. Half a year ago, I achieved Divine Transcendence. Therefore, I invite you to celebrate with me on Heartless Island on the 18th of next month...”

The invitation mentioned that Blood Feather Tower would put Jian Nantian to death, as a sacrifice to heaven, during the party.

After receiving the invitation, all of Tianzong Dynasty immediately fell into a heated discussion.

Divine Transcendence!

The Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower had reached Divine Transcendence?

Since the Tianzong Dynasty began, a second supreme expert of Divine Transcendence finally appeared.

Innumerable people were shocked.

It seemed like the Yin-Yang Void Realm was only one step away from Divine Transcendence. In fact, the level of Divine Transcendence was much higher than that of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

It was hard to reach it.

There were many experts and geniuses stuck at this step.

Di Xi, who was ranked number one on the Heavenly Dragon List, still remained at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

He had shocked the Tianzong Dynasty with his incredible strength and ranked first on the Heavenly Dragon List for dozens of years, but he had not reached Divine Transcendence.

Now, the Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower, who rarely showed up or fought with others, had quietly made a breakthrough and become the second person to reach Divine Transcendence in the history of the Tianzong Dynasty.

This news rocked the Tianzong Dynasty.

Quite a few experts were somewhat surprised that Jian Nantian would be executed.

“Jian Nantian, who is he?”

“Which Jian Nantian? I haven’t heard of him before. Why would Blood Feather Tower want to put him to death on that day?”

“Haha, Jian Nantian was once an extremely powerful figure. No one knows why Blood Feather Tower wanted to kill him. Jian Nantian had something to do with the Ji Clan, one of the Eight Clans. It’s said that the Ji Clan was destroyed by Blood Feather Tower because of Jian Nantian. Jian Nantian is Jian Wushuang’s father.”

“Jian Wushuang’s father? That’s right.”

“Hum, It’s being called an execution, but I think it was a trap set by Blood Feather Tower. They want to force Jian Wushuang to show up by using Jian Nantian. How vicious!”

A large number of experts kept sighing while thinking about it.

All the forces who had received this invitation responded by saying they would go to the Heartless Island on time.

In the Dragon Palace, “It’s a trap!”

“This is a trap!”

Palace Master White’s pretty face was somewhat distorted, with a flicker of coldness in her eyes.

“Indeed, It’s a trap!” Palace Master Black nodded.

Palace Master White said in a low voice, “Jian Wushuang must know it’s a trap. He has a deep affection for his father, so he will walk into it without hesitation even if he knows it. No one can stop him because it’s related to his father’s life.”

“Damn it, this is so despicable!”

Despicable!

It was indeed very despicable.

Everyone knew that there was no justice in this world. The rule was that winner takes all.

All the experts could say nothing, even though they saw through Blood Feather Tower’s trap and contemptible behavior.

In a secret chamber of the Raindrop Pavilion, Tang Wuji found Jian Wushuang and gave this invitation to him.

The Raindrop Pavilion had become more famous in the Tianzong Dynasty, so it also received a blood-red invitation.

After he carefully read this invitation, Jian Wushuang threw it aside and sat alone, without saying a word.

“Boss, obviously, this invitation is a trap which is used to tempt you. Don’t be impulsive,” Tang Wuji said in a somewhat anxious voice.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He knew that it was a trap.

However, this was something that he had to do even though he knew that he should not do it.

Moreover, it was his father who would be put to death.

His father gave him life, raised him, and taught him swordsmanship. In his mind, he was the most respectful father.

“A man should know what he can do and what he cannot.”

“As a son, I would be unfilial if I ignored it while my father is killed.”

“I’m upright, how can I be an unfilial man?” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“But boss...” Tang Wuji wanted to say something, but Jian Wushuang directly interrupted him by waving his hand.

“Don’t say anything. I’ve made up my mind. It’s useless to try persuading me.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Tang Wuji. Then he picked up this invitation and continued to read it.

“On the 18th of next month. I only have one month.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“One month...”

“It’s fine. Blood Feather Tower gave some time to prepare for it.”

“Tang Wuji.” Jian Wushuang looked at Tang Wuji.

“Boss, I’ll do anything you order,” Tang Wuji replied.

“Your Raindrop Pavilion is good at collecting information. So it should also be fast at spreading news. I want you to help me release some news. Please let all the people in Tianzong Dynasty know it as quickly as possible, OK?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No problem.” Tang Wuji nodded seriously.

“Fine.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a hint of fierceness.

“Listen, this is what you should say.” Jian Wushuang meditated for a while and then spoke slowly.

His cold voice resounded through this secret chamber with a hint of killing intent.

“On the 18th of the twelfth lunar month, there will be boundless white snow. At this time, demons and monsters will abound on the evil Heartless island.

“The mountains will split asunder, the rivers will run dry, and the skies will be stained with blood as swords point towards the demon horde.

“If the heavens favor me, it would be fortunate. However, if the heavens oppose me, there will be death!

“With a sword in hand, I am invincible!”
