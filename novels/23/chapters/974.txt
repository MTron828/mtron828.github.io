Chapter 975: The Arrival of Master Ku

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Master Ku?” West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor were both a little startled but delight soon crept up on their faces.

They had all heard of Master Ku, who was one of the 18 masters of Void Temple like Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

Being a Master of Void Temple, he would naturally be strong. Even if he wasn’t a top-tier Rank Three master like Xue Lingtian, his battle strength was still of Rank Three. Furthermore, he held a reputation as an expert amongst the Rank Three Dao Masters.

It came as no surprise that Master Ku had been famous long before Xue Lingtian.

“Even God is on our side!” Ape Celestial Master laughed. “Just as we’re worrying if Jian Wushuang as strong as he had been 1,200 ago, Master Ku shows up!”

“Master Ku is a Rank Three Dao Master regardless. He’d be able to force out all of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards, and we can then decide if we should advance or retreat.”

“That’s a good idea.” West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor’s eyes lit up in delight.

“Master Ku has already left. Though he’s far from Tang of the East, he’ll be able to arrive within two days with the power of Void Temple. Let’s wait here peacefully for two days,” Ape Celestial Master said.

West Paradise Emperor and Nan Paradise Emperor nodded in agreement.

Thus, for the next few days, the three big countries and Tang of the East settled down calmly.

Tang of the East awaited the response from the three big countries while they awaited Master Ku.

...

On a vast and empty land.

The border of the Green Fire World was surrounded by pure and boundless darkness. No one knew what laid behind the darkness but no one, be it a normal warrior or a Dao Master, ever managed to emerge alive from it.

Someone wearing a golden robe slowly appeared at the end of the pitch-black darkness.

Each step he took seemed to take forever yet appeared to take him extremely far. Every single step created invisible ripples in the dark Void.

Even though he had been standing at the end of the darkness, he easily arrived at the border of the Green Fire World in just several steps.

The golden-robed man raised his head, revealing his old visage, as he stood firmly on the ground.

It was a white-haired elder who looked benevolent, with a blood-red cinnabar mole in his midbrows.

He looked up at the sky above and took in the familiar air around him with a gentle smile.

“I’m back.”

“I’m finally returning to my hometown after traveling for so long.”

“The smell of hometown is indeed comforting.”

He stretched and murmured to himself before mysteriously disappearing.

...

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

Per Ape Celestial Master’s estimation, it took Master Ku only two days to arrive in Tang of the East.

However, instead of approaching anyone from the three big countries, he appeared directly in front of the imperial palace.

“Jian Wushuang, prepare to die!”

His resounding voice penetrated the formation, ringing loud and clear inside the palace.

Many experts from Tang of the East gathered inside the palace. They became extremely energetic and enthusiastic after learning that Jian Wushuang was still alive, a stark change from their previous depressed and lethargic state. They now revered him more than Emperor Xiao.

The experts from within the royal palace raged after hearing Master Ku’s voice.

“Who is it? Which ridiculous person dare to provoke Master Jian Wushuang?”

“Humph! Even the strongest of the three big countries, Ape Celestial Master, dares not speak to Master Jian Wushuang in such a tone!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“He seeks death! Let’s see how Master Jian Wushuang gets rid of this man.”

Voices of discussion rippled in all corners of the palace.

Inside the palace, those waiting for the response of the three big countries frowned when they heard Master Ku’s voice.

“This voice doesn’t belong to the three rulers of the three big countries. Who is it?” Emperor Xiao was confused but he soon received a report on the challenger outside.

“Master Ku?” Emperor Xiao’s face darkened.

“Master Ku?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“The only people with the word ‘Master’ in their titles are the 18 masters of Void Temple.”

His Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian, was Master Blood Saber of the 18 masters.

“Jian Wushuang, we’re in trouble now.” Emperor Xiao’s voice deepened. “I just got news that the man provoking you outside is Master Ku of the 18 masters of Void Temple. Though he’s not as strong as your Senior Brother, Master Blood Saber, he has an outstanding reputation and respectable skills. He’s among the strongest Rank Three Dao Masters.”

“As a member of Void Temple, Master Ku shouldn’t be involved in the battle between the three big countries and Tang of the East. Neither do I have feuds with him. Why is he here?” Jian Wushuang became more confused.

“You’re not entirely unrelated with him.” Emperor Xiao laughed bitterly. “He’s the Senior Brother of the Dao Master Gu Ji that you killed two days ago.”

“What? Such a coincidence!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He didn’t expect Dao Master Gu Ji would have such a Senior Brother.

“I just heard of this myself. I don’t know the details.” Emperor Xiao laughed. “You can ask your Senior Brother about him. Seeing as they’re colleagues, they should be familiar with each other.”

“Sounds like a plan.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He then took out his Message Token to pass a message to Xue Lingtian.

“How’s life, Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang greeted him casually.

Xue Lingtian responded after a while.

“Haha! It’s been more than 1,000 years since I heard your voice. I thought you really died in the war of the imperial palace until our master told us you’re still alive.” Xue Lingtian was delighted.

Those in the outside world were definitely in the dark as Emperor Xiao never revealed to the public that Jian Wushuang was still alive.

However, as Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian was able to learn the details from Xuan Yi.

He had heaved a sigh of relief when he found out that Jian Wushuang was still alive.

“Senior Brother, I want to ask you about someone,” Jian Wushuang said straightforwardly.
