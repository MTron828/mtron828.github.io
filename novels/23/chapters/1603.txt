Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang looked at the lofty palaces before him.

Every palace gave him an extremely shocked feeling.

“Jian Wushuang, follow me.”

Real God Wu Liang brought Jian Wushuang to the front of those palaces then they landed on one of the platforms. Real God Wu Liang immediately revealed a humble manner when he landed.

Then, at the front of the platform, there was a figure than gradually substantiated. It was a tan-skinned elderly who looked really scrawny in hemp clothes.

The elderly looked ugly but the aura that he gave out was aloof.

“Almighty?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and he immediately behaved respectfully.

“Old Snake,” Real God Wu Liang greeted politely.

“Lineage of Star’s?” The tan-skinned ugly-looking elderly, Old Snake, glanced at Real God Wu Liang then at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Old Snake looked surprised but he quickly resumed normalcy, “A Universe God who can come to Thunderbolt Island. You should be the inverse cultivator in Lineage of Star. I have heard of you before. As for your name, I can’t recall.”

“I’m Jian Wushuang. Greetings, senior,” Jian Wushuang bowed as he replied.

“Senior?” Old Snake laughed, “Just call me Old Snake like everyone else.”

“Jian Wushuang, Old Snake is the person in charge of Fairy Palaces. Whoever intends to enter Fairy Palace on Thunderbolt Island has to acquire his permission,” Real God Wu Liang introduced.

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“You want to enter Fairy Palace? Pass me your token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy,” Old Snake said.

Then, Jian Wushuang immediately took out a token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy.

“With this token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, you can choose to enter any Fairy Palace and comprehend for a hundred years. You can opt to stay for one hundred years in one go, or you can opt to comprehend periodically. Every time you enter to comprehend, you must at least stay for a year,” Old Snake said.

“There are options?” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy and smiled, “This is my first time entering Fairy Palace. I don’t know what I’ll encounter. I’ll go in to comprehend for one year first.”

“Sure,” Old Snake nodded. He waved the token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy in his hand faintly. Then, he returned the token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy to Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang took it back and skimmed through it with Soul Power. He immediately noticed that there was a number on the token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, the number was ninety-nine.

“It meant that I have ninety-nine years left?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you once retrieved the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation by Real God Jue He.” Real God Wu Liang suddenly looked at him.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation had provided great help to Jian Wushuang in terms of Reincarnation Doctrine and Sword Principle at the beginning.

But then, as his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine and Sword Principle had continued to increase, the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation wasn’t as helpful as before.

“The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation by Real God Jue He actually was created in the simulation of Fairy Palace. You have the experience of comprehending the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation so you should be able to avoid the roundabout ways when you are comprehending in Fairy Palace,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang looked shocked.

“You’ll know when you go in and try,” Real God Wu Liang flashed a mysterious smile.

Jian Wushuang walked towards one of the Fairy Palaces immediately without hesitation.

“Reincarnation Fairy Palace.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Fairy Palace before him and smiled. Then, he immediately entered the Fairy Palace.

It was a vast and boundless starry night. The starry night stretched as far as his eyes could see and it was dim.

Jian Wushuang was standing right in the middle of the vast starry night.

“Starry night? This feels just like Real God Hall in Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

But just as he was thinking, the starry night immediately changed. The strange strength that filled the air gathered in the starry night. In the end, it derived into one scroll painting after another. The scroll paintings were scattered around Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang took a closer look and realized that there were a total of twenty-seven scroll paintings.

The twenty-seven scroll paintings, every one of them was huge. On every scroll painting, there was a mountain, a mountain that was made of broken stones.

Jian Wushuang looked at one of the scroll paintings and he saw every single stone that made out the mountain in the scroll painting. Every single stone gave a distinct feeling to Jian Wushuang.

“Reincarnation Doctrine?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and he was enveloped by the scroll painting right in front of him.

The mountain in the painting was made of countless stones flawlessly.

A total… of eleven thousand one hundred and eleven stones.

At that very moment, under Jian Wushuang’s full attention, every one of the eleven thousand one hundred and eleven stones turned into a part of Reincarnation Doctrine.

“This, this… is too magical!”

Jian Wushuang stared and immediately looked at the other twenty-six scroll paintings while the twenty-six scroll paintings were also mountains that were made of eleven thousand one hundred and eleven stones.

Every single stone was part of Reincarnation Doctrine.

A part to the entire Reincarnation Doctrine could be nothing. But mountains that were formed by eleven thousand one hundred and eleven of parts each played an extremely important position in Reincarnation Doctrine.

Twenty-seven scroll paintings. If the twenty-seven mountains were to combine… It would be a complete Reincarnation Doctrine!

“I understand!”

“This is dissection!”

“One, or maybe a few, experts who reached a high level in Reincarnation Doctrine teamed up and dissected the complete Reincarnation Doctrine in detail.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“They dissected Reincarnation Doctrine into twenty-seven parts and every part was dissected into eleven thousand one hundred and eleven elements!”

“Making complications simple!”

“An unbelievable measure!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was filled with astonishment.

One should know that a complete Reincarnation Doctrine was unfathomable and it was extremely difficult to study and comprehend.

If it were to be dissected perfectly, dissecting Reincarnation Doctrine into twenty-seven parts would make it much easier to comprehend.

It was just like if a person were to eat a big pancake, it would be impossible if a person wanted to eat it all in one. No one would be able to do so. Hence, if he were to cut the pancake into four or eight pieces, it would be much easier to eat.

The twenty-seven scroll paintings in Reincarnation Fairy Palace worked on the same principle.

“No wonder Elder Wu Liang said that the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation by Real God Jue He derived from Reincarnation Fairy Palace. It was really so. However, Real God Jue He was only a Real God after all. No matter how he simulated, he merely copied part of it, but the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation was still extraordinarily precious.”

“Comparing the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation to the twenty-seven scroll paintings in Reincarnation Fairy Palace, they were miles apart.”

Jian Wushuang was exclaiming in surprise.

Plus, Jian Wushuang also found out that the twenty-seven scroll paintings had not only dissected the Reincarnation Doctrine so flawlessly and so simply, but the scroll paintings also contained extremely strong guiding power too.
