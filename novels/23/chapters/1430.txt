Chapter 1431: Universe God Ranking List

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Talents listed in the Real God ranking list were all the top, genius Real God in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries who could easily slaughter a group of ordinary Real Gods.

Like Lei Chao, he was on the list.

The Universe God ranking list was similar. It gathered a group of top Universe Gods in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

Without incomparable skills of the Third Heaven level, or overwhelmingly powerful strength, talents could never be listed in the Universe God ranking list.

Like Lin Xue who just fought with Hou Yi.

She was the top genius of Dark Phoenix Pavilion’s Universe God in the Third Heaven and had numerous skills, as well as unique skills for a Real God, but she wasn’t on the list.

“On the list, even the weakest one acquires extraordinary unique skills for Real Gods, which enables them to defeat a group of Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. And those who are even better are people who understand The Power of Way of Heaven, including you.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang understood. Anyone who had acquired The Power of Way of Heaven was absolutely, incomparably powerful.

The majority in the Universe God ranking list were incomparably powerful.

The top twenty of the list were the best among the best.

As for Leng Jun that Hou Yi had mentioned, he was only at the bottom.

Hou Yi also knew that he himself was at the bottom, so he didn’t dare to challenge those who were better than him.

“The Lineage of Star is full of geniuses, and there are many gifted Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, but only two are on the list and not among the top!” Jian Wushuang felt amazed.

Only disciples from the Star Palace like Jian Wushuang could enter the Real God Palace for cultivation. And even if they were allowed to enter, not all talents could understand the Power of Way of Heaven.

Therefore, only two of the five disciples of the Star Palace could understand the Power of the Way of Heaven and they were both on the list.

“Jian Wushuang, now you have understood part of the reincarnation power. As long as you return to the Star Palace and use The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation to improve your swordsmanship, you should not be weaker than those in the list.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

Indeed, not everyone on the list had acquired the power of the way of heaven. So when Jian Wushuang returned to the Star Palace and used The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation to improve his swordsmanship, and developed powerful unique skills, he could rival the talents on the list.

He went back to the Star Pavilion and waited for a night.

Tian Shi sent back the first-class Blood essence to him the next day.

“Thank you very much.” Jian Wushuang said.

Then, he returned directly to the Sword Star.

Now he was sitting down in the Sword Star

“Let’s get started.”

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and nine drops of blood were suspended in front of him.

Subsequently, Jian Wushuang, according to the instruction of the Xuan Mie Golden body, began to practice the first volume.

The process of cultivation was rather complicated and there were many steps. If there was just one mistake in these steps, all previous efforts would be discarded, and the nine drops of blood would be wasted. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang was not anxious. Instead, he did it step by step.

Three years had passed.

“Hum!”

With a muffled hum, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, but then he frowned.

“Failed.”

“Fortunately, I’ve prepared three copies of my blood. It’s nothing to fail once. There are two more chances.”

With a faint smile, the sword has recovered and reached its peak, and he immediately began to practice for the second time.

This second practice took twelve years.

This time, although Jian Wushuang encountered some troubles in his practice, he passed through them one by one.

“The first volume of the Xuan Mie Golden Body has been finished!”

Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly and looked at his own Divine Body excitedly.

He could clearly sense the strength of his own Divine Body.

After he had passed the second Inverse Cultivation Test, he got more powerful than a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. And now, after finishing the first volume of the Xuan Mie Golden Body, his Divine Body had reached the level of a Real God!

Now, even without any other means of protecting the body, he could resist the attack of an ordinary Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven with his own Divine Body.

Don’t forget, he still had the Blood-killing Plate Armor!

The defensive ability of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, when combined with Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body, could totally rival one to two Real Gods.

“King of Venomous Worms, you’re right. For practitioners, the most important thing is the defending ability. Only with this ability can we resolve crisis after crisis and have the opportunity to constantly improve our strength. Now, I have Xuan Mie Golden Body and Secret Skill of Dragon Blood. I think few Universe Gods can rival me now.”

Jian Wushuang was full of confidence.

His defensive ability was incomparable among Universe Gods.

Even King of Venomous Worms admitted that.

“Now I have to find ways to improve my swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang then took out The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.

The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation was a perfect combination of incarnation and swordsmanship.

Jian Wushuang unrolled the painting.

“Well, there are nine patterns in this The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation. These nine patterns contain different skills and perceptions of reincarnation. Now, according to my swordsmanship, I can only understand the first three patterns!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang began to study the first three patterns of The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.
