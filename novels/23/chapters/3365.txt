Chapter 3368: Looking for Someone

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Amethyst Fog Sea, around the secret realm of heaven and earth, many sergeants of the patrol team and experts of the Xiaoyao Mansion were waiting quietly.

Suddenly, the void rippled, and a space passage appeared out of thin air. Then two figures stepped out of the space passage one after another.

Jian Wushuang was fine when he saw the two figures, but when the people around him saw Demon Master Chen Huo, they were all shocked, especially the Principles Masters who had entered the secret realm of Heaven and earth.

Previously in the secret realm of heaven and earth, they were completely shocked by the monstrous strength displayed by Demon Master Chen Huo. They were all filled with fear and fear towards him, now, seeing that Demon Master Chen Huo had actually walked out of the secret realm of heaven and
earth, they naturally could not calm down.

Jian Wushuang saw the gazes of the surrounding people and immediately smiled. “Everyone, don’t be too nervous. Demon Master Chen Huo is now one of us.”
“One of us?” Everyone was stunned.

Jian Wushuang did not explain too much. Instead, he looked directly at Marquis Xiaoyao who was beside him. “Marquis Xiaoyao, we were wrong. There are no opportunities or treasures in the secret land of heaven and earth, and our Temporal Temple did not get anything. Naturally, your trip to the
Xiaoyao Mansion will be in vain.”

Marquis Xiaoyao’s expression changed. He took a deep look at Jian Wushuang and then looked at Demon Master Chen Huo. Although he knew it was not that simple, he did not intend to pursue the matter any further.
“Let’s go!”

Marquis Xiaoyao waved his hand and left with the people of Xiaoyao Mansion.

After the people of Xiaoyao Mansion lett…

“Duan Lang, Yue Yu, this is for you. Take it and divide it among yourselves.” Jian Wushuang took out an interspatial ring and handed it to Duan Lang.

Duan Lang and Yue Yu looked at each other in bewilderment.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, didn’t you say that you didn’t get the opportunity treasure left by the Amethyst Demon Sect in the secret realm?” Duan Lang asked.

“No, but I did get something else. It’s not a small gain. As the people who discovered the secret realm, you deserve it,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

It was true that he did not get the opportunity treasure left by the Amethyst Demon Sect in the secret realm, but he did get a helper at the peak of the Six Void Realms, which was more than enough for him, it was much more valuable than obtaining a lot of resources and treasures.

“Zhen Tong.” Jian Wushuang looked at Zhen Tong Master who was beside him. “Now that I know what happened in the Amethyst Fog Sea, I’ll let you lead the patrol team back to the camp. As for me, I still have some private matters to deal with in the Second Heaven. I’ll come back when I’m done.”
“Yes.” Zhen Tong Master nodded respectfully.

Although the patrol ambassadors were the leaders of the patrol teams, they were usually quite relaxed because they rarely went out on missions. Now, Jian Wushuang had to deal with some private matters in the Second Heaven, he was allowed to do so.

As long as he could come back in time when the mission was given.

Just like that, after leaving the Amethyst Fog Sea, they parted ways. Zhen Tong Master led the patrol team back to the camp, while Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo stayed in the Second Heaven.

Above the vast void, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo flew slowly.

“Demon Master Chen Huo, I have reported your matter to Temple Master Bai Xing of the Temporal Temple. Temple Master Bai Xing has promised you a position of worship. In addition, Temple Master Bai Xing has also instructed the intelligence department of the Temporal Temple to look for the experts
left behind by the Amethyst Demon Sect. However, we can’t be sure how long it will take to find them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Demon Master Chen Huo nodded slightly, then said, “From today on, I’m your guard. You don’t have to call me Demon Master Chen Huo anymore. Just call me Chen Huo.”


“Chen Huo? Sure.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, where do you want to go now?” Demon Master Chen Huo asked.

“You’ll know when we get there.” Jian Wushuang kept him guessing,

Demon Master Chen Huo did not ask further. He followed Jian Wushuang forward. During this time, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo teleported several times and arrived at an even faster speed. Just a day later…they arrived at their destination.

It was a grand canyon surrounded by mountains. There were towering peaks around it. At a glance, there seemed to be no less than dozens of them. However, these peaks were arranged in a unique way, the surrounding canyon was completely covered. The peaks and the canyon were connected to the
magic array in a special way, making it look like a whole.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo stood in the void near the canyon. They looked down at the canyon, but because of the restrictive magic array, even they could not see the inside of the canyon.
“If I remember correctly, this place should be the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, right?” Demon Master Chen Huo looked at Jian Wushuang.
“Chen Huo, you’ve been alone in the secret land of heaven and earth for nearly 200 million years. You almost forgot your own name, but you can still recognize this sect’s lair. It’s rare,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Nonsense. I was an elder of the Amethyst Demon Sect, and the Amethyst Demon Sect is one of the overlords of the Second Heaven. Of course, I pay attention to the other overlords and some top forces in the Second Heaven, especially the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. It’s the only existence in the
Second Heaven that even the Amethyst Demon Sect fears. Moreover, when I was young, I had dealings with the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. I’ve been to the mountain gate of the valley a few times, so of course, I remember it,” Demon Master Chen Huo said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“But I’ve been in the secret land of heaven and earth for too long. I wonder what has happened to the valley. Who is the current Valley Master?” Demon Master Chen Huo asked.

“The current Valley Master of the valley is called Longyu,” Jian Wushuang said. He had already gotten some information about the valley from the Temporal Temple. He knew about the Valley Master and some experts of the valley, he had a good understanding of them.
“Longyu? It’s this overbearing woman?” Demon Master Chen Huo raised his eyebrows. Apparently, he knew the current Valley Master of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

“By the way, Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are you doing in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley?” Demon Master Chen Huo asked.

“Looking for someone,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Looking for someone? Who?” Demon Master Chen Huo asked.

“My wife, Leng Rushuang!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wife?” Demon Master Chen Huo was stunned.

Jian Wushuang did not hide anything and simply told Demon Master Chen Huo about his wife.
