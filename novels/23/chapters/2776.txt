Chapter 2777: Took Action

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The Sword Alliance is such a big household, I’m sure nothing can be taken lightly.” Blood Thunder King smiled without much care. “I did not expect Yin Su’re to take such speedy actions and her means are really great. I’m afraid that Yun Shan might fall here in this battle.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the battlefield far away and slightly nodded.

It was true that Yin Su’er obviously had the upper hand in this battle between two parties and it was a great upper hand.

Yun Shan’s faction seemed to be in the fight under suppression.

However, it would still take some time if Yin Su’er’s side wanted to completely defeat Yun Shan’s faction and she definitely needed to pay a certain price.

“We shall wait here and after both factions have been badly wounded from the fight, we shall go out to clean up the messy situation.” Blood Thunder King said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Outside of Bane City, the Sword Alliance controlled by Jian Wushuang and Blood Thunder King’s faction stood in the void as they looked on silently.

They looked on as Ying Suer and Yun Shan’s factions fought. The battle got increasingly intense and crazy.

The crazy fight between almost 40 Grand Ultimate Gods caused a shocking amount of movement.

Under such a large scale of crazy fight, these Grand Ultimate Gods were unable to completely protect their own lives.

Within mere moments...

Bomb!

The Divine Body of an elder in green robe was directly penetrated and his life was instantly ended.

Since the battle started, the first fallen Grand Ultimate God had appeared.

“It’s Grand Ultimate God Bing Yu from Yun Shan’s faction. He’s really unlucky to be the first one to die.”

“He’s really unlucky as he’s only a usual Primary-level Grand Ultimate God but he had to face two masters in the same level and was even secretly attacked by a High-level Grand Ultimate God from the fight beside. It seems difficult to stay alive under such circumstances.

“It’s not completely because of luck. There’s quite a huge difference between the strength of both sides.”

The experts under Blood Thunder King’s lead were hiding in the void outside Bane City and they were secretly sighing about the situation.

The elder in green roves was the first one to die. It was impossible for him to be the only fallen expert in such an intense and crazy battle.

Following that, the experts died in the battle one after another. Some of them were from Yun Shan’s faction and there were also others from Yin Su’er’s faction.

However, due to the difference between their strength, most of the experts who died were from Yun Shan’s faction.

Soon, there were ten experts who died in the battle and among them, seven of them were from Yun Shan’s faction.

It had to be understood that the number of Grand Ultimate Gods from Yun Shan’s faction were much lesser compared to Yin Su’er’s faction. Now that they had lost seven of them, they did not have much Grand Ultimate Gods left and their disadvantage in the battle grew.

“Yun Shan’s faction can’t hold it much longer.”

“There has originally been a huge difference between their combat power. Now that Yun Shan’s faction has lost seven Grand Ultimate Gods while Yin Su’er’s faction only lost three, the difference is even much more obvious.”

“Yun Shan is going to be defeated after all.” The experts under Blood Thunder King’s lead were still discussing among themselves.

“Blood Thunder King, when shall we take action?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Blood Thunder King.

“Be patient and wait a little longer. Let them fight for a longer period of time.” Blood Thunder King’s eyes were sparkling.

Jian Wushuang was naturally unfazed as Yin Su’er was the one with the upper hand right now.

After some time, the experts from both parties were already in a terrible situation from the fight, especially those from Yun Shan’s faction.

Half of the originally more than a dozen Grand Ultimate Gods had fallen and the remaining Grand Ultimate Gods were also badly wounded.

Even Yun Shan himself...

Bomb!

Following a horrendous hum that could be heard throughout the entire battlefield, Yun Shan’s figure went bursting outwards in a battered manner.

At this moment, Yun Shan’s face was extremely pale with blood at the corners of his mouth. His divine power was obviously weakened compared to how he was previously.

Yun Shan was obviously heavily wounded.

“Yun Shan, you are definitely losing this battle!” Yin Su’er had a great amount of divine power surging through her body. She stood there with her arrogant figure and looked down at everything like a divine goddess.

In this one to one fight between Yin Su’er and Yun Shan, it was obvious that Yin Su’er was stronger!

Yun Shan, who was already badly wounded, stood there as he looked at his surroundings. The Grand Ultimate Gods under his lead had extremely darkened expressions.

He definitely lost in this battle and it was a terrible loss.

The strength Yin Su’er accumulated had completely surpassed him.

“Attack!” Yin Su’er said in a cold voice as she wanted to carry out another attack.

The Grand Ultimate Gods behind her had extremely high will to kill in their eyes as they once again took action.

As for the Grand Ultimate Gods from Yun Shan’s faction, they looked extremely pale but an unprecedented craziness could be seen in their eyes.

“Fight them with all you have!”

“Kill! Kill!”

The people in the battle had gone completely crazy.

In the void outside of Bane City, Jian Wushuang and Blood Thunder King, who was standing next to him, saw everything that happened in Bane City’s battlefield.

“It’s almost time for us to take action.” Blood Thunder King smiled coldly.

“Are we taking action now?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Blood Thunder King, who was beside him. “Between these two factions, shall we take action towards Yin Su’er’s faction first or Yun Shan’s faction? Or should we take action against both factions at the same time?”

“We should pulverize an already defeated enemy first. We should wipe out the old man Yun Shan first before taking action against Yin Su’er.” Blood Thunder King said.

“Take action against Yun Shan first?” Jian Wushuang slightly frowned.

Right now, both Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s factions had been badly wounded as they suffered huge losses. Among them, Yun Shan was completely routed.

If they take action at this moment, they should do it towards Yin Su’er first as the right thing to do was to weaken the combat power of Yin Su’er’s faction. However, Blood Thunder King chose to take action against Yun Shan first to completely defeat or kill him on the spot so that he was left with no options out before taking action against Yin Su’er.

Blood Thunder King was so confident in their side’s strength?

“Let’s take action.” Blood Thunder King did not explain too much and only said this. Then, the dozen over Grand Ultimate Gods behind him moved at the same time under his personal lead.

Jian Wushuang also did not linger. With a wave of his hand, a Gold-armored Corpse Pupper, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets appeared in front of him at the same time.

After that, Jian Wushuang went skimming speedily towards Bane City as he led these corpse puppets together with Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and the others.

In Bane City, both Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s forces were still in a heated fight, suddenly...

A huge amount of figures came skimming over from the surrounding void. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

There were lots of experts as Blood Thunder King’s faction alone had 16 Grand Ultimate Gods. Together with the six Grand Ultimate Gods, including Jian Wushuang, from Sword Alliance and four corpse puppets, there were a total of 26 experts from the Grand Ultimate God level. They directly came attacking in a loud and horrifying manner.

Experts from both factions fighting in the battlefield immediately noticed this.

“That is... Blood Thunder King?”
