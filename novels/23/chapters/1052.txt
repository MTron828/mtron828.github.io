“That is simple.” Su Rou agreed heartily.

The tasks of keeping an eye for any high-leveled warriors of the Samsara Temple or seeking out information of Jian Wushuang’s mother from the Ancient Demon clan were hardly difficult for the Blood Asura Clan.

“There is another matter.” A thin smile lined across Jian Wushuang’s face. “As one of the greatest tribes of the Samsara Continent, the Blood Asura Clan must have birthed a great many experts skilled in using the sword. Surely there are plenty of manuscripts or manuals left by these powerful forefathers of your clan?”

“That is true. We do indeed have many manuscripts and manuals on swordplay.” Su Rou nodded.

“With your permission, I would like to borrow them for my study. They will all be returned safely before I leave. I shall gladly pay the price of this favor.” Jian Wushuang said.

Focused intently only in the study of wielding the sword, Jian Wushuang has yet only reached the Universe Level despite having being inspired to create three new Sword Principles of his own.

The three Sword Principles of his own creation still has a great room for improvement. A flaw which could only be improved by conducting more research with the manuscripts left by the powerful swordsmen of old.

“That will not matter. These are but old and dusty books. I will have them brought to you if you have need of them. There shall be no need for any repayment for the favor.” Su Rou remarked with a smile.

With a twitch of his eyebrows, Jian Wushuang nodded graciously.

Su Rou then took her leave to make the arrangements.

“Does this mean that you intend to stay here, for now, Jian Wushuang?” The Gu King asked.

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “I have done all I could for now. With no need for hastiness, I might as well stay here to find ways to improve myself. I would have not had to worry so much and I would never have to try by means of Jiu Xiu if only I have greater strength. I could have easily gotten all answer to my questions by going directly to the lair of the Ancient Demon Clan.”

“That is true. Power is everything in this domain. Your present strength puts you at merely a hair’s breadth away from most Holy Masters. And when you have found ways to enhance any one of your Sword Principles to the Creation Level and heighten your Ancient God Power, you will possess the true battle strength of a Holy Master. And then, you will reign supreme throughout the Green Fire World.” The Gu King illustrated smilingly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That is so.” Jiang Wushuang remarked, smiling himself.

Before long, the manuscripts about various Sword Principles reached Jian Wushuang’s doorsteps. They have been delivered as charged by Su Rou.

With a long and illustrious history, the Blood Asura Clan has an extensive collection of manuscripts left behind by the many swordsmen of the past. There were some which were of foreign origins, procured and kept by the Clan till now.

The Sword Principle manuals were mostly on the newly-created disciplines devised by the swordsmen of the Clan. The disciplines were hardly complex nor powerful yet they each have their own distinctive features.

These were, nonetheless, painstaking and meticulous creations by the hands of their authors.

“Damn. There are one hundred and eighty-eight types of Sword Principles here in amongst the manuscripts which have been delivered to me, all fully-recorded in detail.” The eyes of Jian Wushuang blushed with surprise and joy.

Despite seemingly ordinary and yet diverse in nature, the one hundred and eighty-eight Sword Principles was, in fact, the very thing required by Jian Wushuang to perfect his mastery in Coalescence Sword Principle.

It is through the multitudes of diverse styles of the sword, he has to learn the ability to assimilate them all into one unified style!

The artistry of coalescing different and varying Sword Principles into one, single entity.

It was from henceforth, Jian Wushuang began his stay amongst the Clan of Blood Asura, studying on his own in the courtyard of his lodgings; delving intently into the secrets and teachings of swordsmanship and the many Sword Principles before him.

None of the Blood Asura Clan would be hostile towards him, for he was a guest of the Asura Lord of the Clan. Su Rou would come occasionally to visit. But at most times, life was quiet and tranquil there.

And from the peace and quiet, Jiang Wushuang was able to enjoy himself as he focused all his thoughts on improving his own skills.

Time passed swiftly and unnoticed. In a mere blink of an eye, a hundred and twenty years have fleeted by.

…

In a chamber of the palace of the Blood Asura Clan drenched in darkness and held by a restrictive magical barrier, a large, circular table sat in the middle of the hall. The dark silhouettes of figures could be seen sitting at the table. Perched in the main seat, was the Great Elder Lin Li of the Blood Asura Clan.

“Tomorrow is the Supreme Council of our Clan; the Council which is held every one thousand years. The girl would most certainly be present, and she will demand that I relinquish my control of the Asura Guards.” Lin Li’s eyes flashed dangerously with malice in the darkness.

“The girl’s presence has slowly been smothering what is left of our powers all these years. We have almost nothing now. The command of the Asura Guards is the strongest card in my hand. To surrender it would only render us weak and helpless before her!”

The darkened figures of the elders of the Clan stirred uneasily at her words, obviously displeased with the envisaged outcome.

These were the closest associates of Lin Li. All of whom looked up to him as their chief and captain.

Even now, despite his diminishing authority, they have and would remain steadfast by his side.

They knew well, with the emergence of Asura Lord,the Lordnow has assumed command and control of the affairs of the Clan. This had culminated in the unmistakable pruning and trimming which have usurped Lin Li of much of her authority. This was hardly debatable as Asura Lord has been showered with love by the people of the Clan.

Yet, there remained certain cliques, namely Lin Li’s, within Asura Lord’s court which have been displeased by this.

“That is but a mere sapling that has not even reach the age of two thousand. I only fear that our Clan may one day be hunted and slaughtered by the Ancient Demon Clan or the other two greater clans if this decadence continues. I really have not the foggiest of what the old Su Qian is thinking of.” Lin Li said frostily.

Su Qian was the teacher of Su Rou, who was also the most powerful Upper Elder of the Blood Asura; one whose words bore great weight within the clan.

But he had left the Clan more than a thousand years ago, embarking on a pilgrimage that has yet to see its end.

But if Su Qian has been at the side of Su Rou, Lin Li would never dare to voice her discontent nor would she dare to devise any devious schemes for a coup. But as Su Qian remained elusive, Lin Li’s insolence grew, as had her thirst for power.

“I have been able to ward off the extending tendrils of her ambition when she had demanded for the control of the Asura Guards in the Supreme Council one thousand years ago. I had cited her inexperience in the affairs of the Clan and her unfamiliarity with the state of the Samsara Continent as reasons for my refusal. I am afraid it may not be easy now to avert her away.” Lin Li remarked darkly. “I will need a good and solid reason to deny her again.”

“Did we not have a guest amongst us; an outsider who has been invited here by Asura Lord, Great Elder?” One of the elder champions of the clan asked.

“You mean Jian Wushuang?” Lin Li’s eyes twinkled suddenly. “Indeed, I have almost forgotten about him.”

“It is known that Jian Wushuang has a great many enemies, including the Empyrean Patriarch and the Ancient Demon Clan who had once tried to hunt him down. I believe we may use this as a pretense since we of the Blood Asura Clan have always been at odds with the Ancient Demon Clan.”

“With pretenses such as this, coupled with a few comments about the failings of the girl, I will refuse her request to surrender the control of the Asura Guards!”
