Chapter 339: Bridge of Helplessness, Surge Forth!

“His speed is too fast!”

“How can an expert of the Yang Void Realm be that fast?”

“What he used was the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt, which is the strongest body skill manual in the Holy Emperor Palace. I have no idea how it got into his hands. But the most important factor is the Blood River. It has boosted his strength by too much.”

While in a state of wonderment, the spectating experts held their breaths and continued to watch on.

Blood-red water tumbled and surged maniacally through the Blood River. Mo Yun and co. could faintly see that a bolt of lightning was shuttling through the river at an astonishing speed. The seven of them, who were gathered together, revealed unsightly expressions on their faces.

They had never imagined that Jian Wushuang’s speed would be this fast.

Jian Wushuang was completely dominating the battle because of his frightening speed, as well as the assistance of the wickedly powerful Blood River.

“Don’t panic. This little fella’s strength has reached such a high level mainly because of this river and those methods which he used to upgrade his cultivation. However, these two methods aren’t easy to use. Although this river has limitless power, he will certainly not be able to maintain the cultivation of Spiritual Power for much longer,” Mo Yun muttered to his companions.

The other six people nodded their heads.

They were also aware that the more powerful a method, the more strenuous it was to execute.

“We only need to endure for a while longer. He will naturally drop off soon, and then we can kill him,” Mo Yun said.

However, his expression was somewhat unnatural as he uttered these words.

They were seven experts of the Saint Realm, who had mastered different Domains, fighting against an expert of the Yang Void Realm. Yet, they had to wait until the opponent was tired before they could kill him. This battle was certainly causing them to lose face and suffer embarrassment.

But they had no choice. Jian Wushuang’s strength had truly exceeded their imagination.

And they could not be blamed. Jian Wushuang’s improvement was simply too absurd.

It must be understood that when Jian Wushuang became famous throughout the Tang Dynasty more than a month ago, he barely had the battle strength of an expert of the Saint Realm. He was later hunted down by Tan Feng and narrowly escaped.

It?was currently only a little more than a month since then...

How much could they have reasonably expected Jian Wushuang’s strength to increase by during this period?

By Holy Emperor Palace’s estimations, Jian Wushuang could very most have become equivalent to an expert of the Saint Realm who had mastered a Domain.

Reasonably speaking, seven experts of the Saint Realm who had mastered a Domain should be comfortably able to kill Jian Wushuang. Before they set off, they even felt that deploying seven people was showing too much respect to Jian Wushuang.

But what happened in the end? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang’s improvement was too incredible.

Or perhaps, they had underestimated him from the very start.

An ordinary warrior would indeed be unable to improve by too much within a month. However, this was not necessarily the case for Inverse Cultivators like Jian Wushuang. Most importantly, he received a massive piece of luck during this time.

“Before I started using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, I was already able to kill a Domain master like Tan Feng easily, proving that my battle strength was equivalent to a master of the Third-stage Domain. Now, when I use the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, I am more than capable of holding my own against a supreme expert who has attained the “Pinnacle” Level.?How can these seven people think about killing me?”

A heavy bolt of lightning suddenly solidified in the Blood River and revealed Jian Wushuang’s figure. His lips were slightly curled upward while his eyes conveyed a sense of disdain.

To him, these were “only” seven experts of the Saint Realm, and not one of them had attained the “Pinnacle” Level. There was no chance that they could kill him.

What a joke.

When he saw that they were gathered together, his pupils constricted slightly. “These seven people aren’t dumb. They know that I’m fast and have thus grouped up to prevent me from killing them one-by-one. They’re waiting for me to deplete my Spiritual Power.”

“I cannot allow the battle to drag on. I have to end the battle fast!”

Jian Wushuang stared icily with seemingly electric eyes at the seven experts in front of him. The potent killing intent that was already on his body began to surge once again.

“My Spiritual Power used to be insufficient for me to use “that skill”. But now, I can use the natural power of all things of the universe to support my usage of Heavenly Creation Skill, while I also have just about enough power to use “that skill”!”

Inhaling a deep breath, Jian Wushuang slowly reached out his palm, on which a terrifying Spiritual Power was building up maniacally. He would emit a loud roar from his mouth when this Spiritual Power reached its maximum.

“Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

Boom~~~

The Void tremored and the entire Blood River began to swirl frenziedly.

“What’s happening?”

The faces of the seven experts stiffened. The next moment, below their sights, a blood-red and lofty long bridge appeared at the edge of the Blood River and extended out at an astonishing speed.

The blood-red bridge contained an inconceivable power. Everyone shook internally when it first appeared.

“Retreat fast!” Mo Yun shouted.

None of his six companions dared to hesitate for a moment and hurriedly retreated.

The bridge surged across the spot where they had been standing and stretched until it reached the end of the river. It ultimately ran through the entire river.

“What is this?” Mo Yun and co. stared in shock at the bridge which had suddenly appeared on the river surface.

The river and bridge were both not only incomparably blood-red but also incomparably attractive to the human eye.

Subsequently, from the edge of the bridge, a frosty figure slowly walked along the bridge toward the seven experts.

With every step he took on the bridge, his aura became a notch more powerful. By the time he reached the center of the bridge, his aura had already reached its peak, while at the same time, his body emitted a strong blood light.

The blood light was akin to a heavy blood-red armor which discharged a monstrous power.

Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared at the seven experts who had become scattered because of the bridge’s charge. A roar poured out of his mouth and soared into the nine heavens.

“All seven of you... must die!”

His roar shook the skies!

The entire universe instantly tremored. Even the demons wept and the gods cried.

He simply stood there like the warden of hell.

A trace of fear arose from the bottom of the seven experts’ hearts. Nevertheless, they managed to suppress it. Mo Yun bawled, “This is just a harmless trick. Today, you have to die.”

“Then give it a shot!”

Jiang Wushuang’s voice was somewhat hoarse. A bolt of lightning began to surge as soon as he spoke.

“Hua!”

The bolt of lightning appeared beside the bald man, who had been standing closest to Jian Wushuang.

Once it appeared, a towering sword shadow immediately struck out. At the same instant, a Phantom Giant appeared behind Jian Wushuang’s back. The giant raised the long sword in its hand and chopped downward.

The bald man was profoundly startled. Without thinking, he hastily raised the sickle in his hand and struck out in his attempt to fend off the incoming sword.

However, after the two of them truly made contact...

Crack!

A fine and delicate noise began to sound. Cracks began to appear on the blood-red sickle which the bald man was holding.

The bald man’s pupils severely constricted when he saw what was happening.

“How is this possible?” Mo Yun was also stupefied.

Many of the spectating experts all the more widened their eyes.
