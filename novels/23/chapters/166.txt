Chapter 167: Collision of the Strongest

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the air above the area, those Yin-Yang Void Realm experts were also looking at this battle carefully. All of them had discerned the essence Xue Yun had comprehended.

“The Essence Realm is as vast as the ocean. Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind were just the most common essences. Besides those, there are many devious and unknown essences. Darkness Essence, which Xue Yun has comprehended, is one of those.”

“Though comprehending those devious and unknown essences is harder, their power is also stronger.”

“Comprehending Darkness Essence means that the owner could become darkness incarnate and devour everything. With only this, it’s already stronger than those four common essences.”

“What’s more, Xue Yun combined the Darkness and Gale Essences, which is even more terrifying.”

These experts, in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, could not help asking themselves if any of them could compete against Xue Yun in comprehending essences.

Xue Yun was excellent, but Jian Wushuang was no less impressive.

After all, Jian Wushuang combined three essences.

On the battlefield, the fight had already become white-hot.

“Go to hell!”

A strange stab from Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword pierced the air, brushing past Xue Yun. The sword light hit the ground, immediately creating another crater.

“Buzz off!”

Xue Yun thundered, immediately brandishing the blood-red blade, which seemed random but contained a power that could devour the heaven and the earth. Even Jian Wushuang had to hold his breath when faced with this attack.

“Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!”

The intense sound of fighting echoed through the whole area, over and over again.

The entire Cloud mountain range suffered an unprecedented bombardment. Huge craters, more than a meter deep, could be seen everywhere. The strong blasts created when they crossed swords swept over the area continuously.

The eyes of all the warriors in the area were full of shock, and their hearts were shuddering in fear.

The sounds of the fighting were loud enough to shake the entire area

The collisions were so powerful that the experts on the Earthly Dragon List were afraid to get within a couple hundred meters of those two. The repercussion of their collisions could easily kill anyone on the Earthly Dragon List.

Boom!

Another fierce roar was heard. At that moment, the area seemed to be eclipsed.

Then, finally, these two ferocious figures, who had already fought for over a quarter-hour, separated.

Then, the turbulence in the air and the trembling of the land slowly began to calm down.

Countless eyes were still firmly locked on these two. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But the powerful sword essence and the devouring darkness didn’t show any sign of abating.

“What a surprise! I have never someone at the Gold Core Realm in Tianzong Dynasty could fight with me like this, and you are just at the Profound Gold Core Realm. Your cultivation is actually weaker than mine,” Xue Yun said while staring at Jian Wushuang with cruel eyes.

“What a pity! If we met one or two years from now, after you cultivation had reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, I would not be able to contend with you. But now, as things are, your only choice is to die at my hands.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “It’s not certain who will die.”

“It isn’t?” Xue Yun’s mouth curled up slightly, “Jian Wushuang, you have to be careful of this next move.”

“It’s my first time using this move since I started learning this knife technique. Even three years ago, when I was fighting with Baili Chen and Qing Cang, I didn’t use it. But now, you are qualified to see it.”

“Earthsplitter is the name of this move.”

Following Xue Yun’s voice, the blood-red blade in his hands was lifted up slowly. At the same moment, a terrifying darkness radiated from him again, as that blood-red blade was raised over his head.

“Suddenly, the darkness fell, and the entire sky lost its light.”

While only a scarlet light sparkled in the endless dark.

This scarlet light was the blood-red blade of Xue Yun.

A shocking and dreadful power gathered in this blood-red blade. The countless warriors outside the Cloud mountain range were alarmed when they felt this power.

Even the experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm up in the air felt a shudder of horror. They felt that this move Xue Yun was about to use could easily kill them as well.

“This power...”

“Fearsome!”

Standing side by side with grave faces, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou felt this dreadful power. Su Rou’s eyes were full of worry.

While this frightening power was fermenting, as the target, Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented pressure surging toward him. Under this pressure, instead of being in a panic, he seemed to be inexplicably excited.

A towering battle intent raged in his eyes. At this moment, the invisible Sword Soul in his mind trembled tempestuously and a series of powerful sword essence erupted, shocking all living beings in this world.

As Jian Wushuang held his Triple-kill Sword above his head, he seemed like an ancient peerless Sword Master.

This sword essence suppressed all living things.

“Only the idealism, only the solipsism...”

“I’m the king of this world!”

“I grasped the second move of the Selfless Sword Technique just now. Let me test its power on you!”

A gleaming light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. The sword, which had already gathered enough power, furiously chopped out without warning.

Meanwhile, the only light in the darkness, the blood-red blade, immediately hacked out as well.

Instantly, two massive and horrifying forces, which could easily kill those in the Profound Gold Core Realm, fiercely collided in the air.

It felt like a collision between two stars.

All of a sudden, the entire world began to swing violently. With a rumbling noise, landslides occurred on more than ten of the mountains in the Cloud mountain range, with tons of debris flooding the area.

At the place where the forces had collided, the energy formed a substantial Blast Wave, shooting out all directions, at a visible speed, extending to the border of the Cloud mountain range.

“Oh, no.”

The numerous warriors on the border of the Cloud mountain range changed their countenance when they saw the terrifying Blast Wave, containing a horrendous power, that was coming towards them.

“Hurry! We have to stop this Blast Wave!”

A captain of the Royal Guards shouted, then dozens of Royal Guards, who maintained order around the outskirts of the Cloud mountain range, immediately took action.

Though these Royal Guards were only in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, they had a tacit understanding with each other. If dozens of them worked together, a common attack from the Initial Yin Void Realm could easily be stopped.

But the result was...

That terrifying Blast Wave swept over those Royal Guards in an instant, without any resistance.

“Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!”

At this time, dozens of Royal Guards spat blood, immediately retreating. In the end, this Blast Wave was stopped by the Golden-armored General in the Yang Void Realm.
