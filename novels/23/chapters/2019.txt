2020 In Imperial City

The three Great Emperors didn’t fight back. Hence, they were naturally suppressed into Blood Mountain Sword easily.

“When you are in Blood Mountain Sword, you can still communicate with me through consciousness. You will also be able to see whatever happens in the outside world as well,” Jian Wushuang communicated with the three Great Emperors in Blood Mountain Sword.

“Jian Wushuang, your sword is very unique. Not only is its attack fierce, its suppressing power is not too shabby. How did you find this?” Abysmal Saint Master asked.

“About this, I can’t tell you,” Jian Wushuang didn’t share. His body suddenly quivered and the muscles all over his body bulged. His body became much stubbier. As his muscles billowed, his skin grew tanned and he gave out a manly vibe.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s muscles started growing as well.

After a short while, Jian Wushuang’s appearance had changed entirely.

A scrawny, young-looking man who looked cold suddenly became a brawny man who kept a beard and was messy. He was wearing ordinary clothing as he wore a malicious smile. On top of that, he put his sword away into his Qian Kun Ring and he was wearing a pair of red gloves.

Even the aura on his body changed tremendously and because unusually furious. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was just like a volcano that had accumulated boundless power. It was as though he would explode anytime.

“Haha. I reckon no one will recognize me like this,” Jian Wushuang laughed and his laughter sounded furious too.

The three Great Emperors in Blood Mountain Sword were surprised but they understood the intention of Jian Wushuang’s actions. He naturally wouldn’t say much.

When all the preparations had been finished, Jian Wushuang departed to the huge city engulfed in the great formation.

At the magnificent entrance of the Imperial City, there were dozens of soldiers in dark armor guarding it.

Even though they were merely soldiers guarding the city entrance, all of them had reached the level of a Chaotic Real God!

A Chaotic Real God could be the Monarch of a Holy Kingdom in Eternal Chaotic World. However, in the supreme sanctuary of Three-Emperors World, Imperial City, a Chaotic Real God was only a soldier who guarded that city entrance.

Swoosh!

A brawny figure that gave out a furious aura plunged from the void afar and arrived before the Imperial City’s gate.

The brawny figure appeared and there were instantly a few soldiers who came forward.

“Stop!”

The leading soldier raised his hand.

“Stop? How dare you block my road? Are you sick of living?” The brawny figure, which was Jian Wushuang, glared like a lion eyeing his prey.

The few soldiers’ faces instantly grew grave and they looked shocked.

Before they said anything, there was an elder in a grey robe who flew out from Imperial City.

“I am Mo Su. I wonder who you are,” the elder in a grey robe behaved rather humbly in the beginning.

“I don’t care who you are. Hurry up and move aside. Don’t block my way to enter the city,” Jian Wushuang behaved barbarously.

“Aren’t you too rude? You don’t care about your identity?” The elder in a grey robe, Mo Su, looked to be in distress.

“Hehe, I don’t care about my identity. What does that have to do with you?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

“I’m guessing you’re here for the first time, right?” The elder in the grey robe looked at him.

“So what if I am?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“You have something you don’t know about. Whoever enters the Imperial City has to declare his identity clearly and he has to pay a fee. The rule is set up by the higher-ups in Imperial Cabinet. No one can go against it,” the elder in a grey robe said.

“Is it so? The old folks in Imperial Cabinet are so troublesome,” Jian Wushuang replied impatiently, “Forget it. My name is Ah Shou, which means beast! As for my origins, I do not belong to any sect or cult. I do not belong to any family either. There’s just me, myself and I.”

“I see. It turns out that you are a solo expert with no background.” The elder in a grey robe stole a glance at Jian Wushuang with disdain. “Write down a record. You can enter after you pay the entrance fee.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate. He had already killed two experts in Three-Emperor Worlds, Tian Xingzi and Silver-Winged Mansion Master. Hence, he had enough resources and currency.

After that, he walked into Imperial City straight away.

“We’re in?”

After they entered the Imperial City, Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement. He started looking around.

The three Great Emperors in Blood Mountain Sword saw everything as well.

There were countless huge pavilions and palaces towering in the void.

On top of that, there was a walkway paved using divine power purely, which looked exactly like a normal street.

It was merely a huge city that was more magnificent than an ordinary city. Most importantly, the cultivators’ standard was absolutely the highest among all cities that Jian Wushuang had seen.

The weakest one there was at least a Real God, a Chaotic Real God.

As for Almighties in Chaotic Realm, they were all over the place. Jian Wushuang could feel the obscure aura in the nearby void. The aura had to belong to experts of Great Emperor level in the city.

“Mm, that is…” Jian Wushuang suddenly lifted his gaze to look at the very end of the road.

There was a dim grey light that was dome-shaped. It was actually a formation and it covered a huge territory.

“In Imperial City, there is still an area that is covered in formation?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“This should be Imperial Peak that Silver-Winged Mansion Master was talking about. According to what he had said, Imperial City is merely where the elites of Three-Emperors gather. Any expert who reaches the level of Chaotic Realm or Chaotic Real God who has a backer can enter Imperial City. However, it doesn’t apply to Imperial Peak,” Abysmal Saint Master said in Blood Mountain Sword.

“Imperial Peak is the core of the Imperial City. Imperial Cabinet on top of Imperial Peak. They have the best cultivation resources in Three-Emperors World. However, as they are limited resources, there are not many people who can enter Imperial Peak. One is required to reach a certain level to enter Imperial Peak.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

In other words, the Imperial City was like Thunderbolt Island in Eternal Chaotic World.

There were countless opportunities on Thunderbolt Island, but the sixteen precious Fairy Palace would require a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy to enter.

Imperial City was the cultivation sanctuary of Three-Emperors World. Due to cultivation resources, it also required one to fulfill certain criteria before entering.
