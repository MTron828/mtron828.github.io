Chapter 2385: Have Mercy!

The battle persisted with incredible intensity.

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were in a craze, trying all they could to keep away Mu Clan’s experts. They did their best to buy time for Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao.

However, neither Jian Wushuang nor Miss Xiao made a move under such a situation. In fact, they were still interacting casually.

“Miss Xiao, you should be able to tell by now that Narcissus Island has no special relationship with Mu Clan. It was purely Mu Chan’s plan to use us. Now, they even want to make all of us stay,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Young master, what exactly are you trying to say?” said Miss Xiao calmly.

“What I want to say is that Narcissus Island and Mu Clan have nothing to do with each other, so I beg you to have mercy later,” said Jian Wushuang, having a deeper meaning behind his words.

Miss Xiao’s beautiful eyes were shining with surprise after hearing his words.

Miss Xiao said slowly only after a while, “For me to show mercy isn’t out of the question, but I’ll have to see if you’re worthy.”

“What would you like to have in return?” asked Jian Wushuang calmly.

“These Mu Clan members really annoy me,” said Miss Xiao with sheer lightness.

“Understood, Miss Xiao. Just watch,” said Jian Wushuang.

They did not hide their conversation, since even if people heard them, nobody would understand what they talked about.

However, Xiao Heng and his company were already furious.

“Jian Wushuang, what the hell are you waiting for? Move it!”

Those words came from Xiao Heng as a roar.

He and the four core disciples took Gu Blood Elixir but the efficacy would not last long.

They were thinking of trying their best to buy some time for Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao, but not only had Jian Wushuang not made a move, he even started casually chatting with her!

They were naturally furious about that, so mad that they felt like vomiting blood.

However, right at that moment, Jian Wushuang slowly turned around and took a glance at those Mu Clan experts. Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hand with a flip of his wrist.

Woosh!

Jian Wushuang moved.

He moved in a flash like a phantom, almost like a wind blowing by, not leaving a trace in the void.

Xiao Heng and his company were staring at Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao, thus naturally saw that.

“That speed...”

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were all stunned.

Too fast, that speed was way too fast.

It was unimaginable.

Was a speed like that initiated by Jian Wushuang, whom they scorned?

How was that possible?

Before they could react, ripples formed in the void with a deep ringing sound.

Coming directly after that was the shadow of a sword.

It seemed regular and calm, almost strengthless.

However, it was that sword shadow which attracted everyone in the battlefield as soon as it appeared, including the white-haired old man and Miss Xiao. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Everybody stared straight at the sword shadow.

It was too beautiful.

So beautiful it was intoxicating.

Whoosh!

The sword shadow slashed across the void, only gradually dissolving after a while.

When it landed on the ground, a figure appeared with it.

That figure was Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him!”

“That kid, what’s he doing?”

“The sword shadow just now was his doing?”

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were quite dumbfounded, unable to snap out of it.

The faces of Mu Clan’s experts were showing amazement too.

That one move from Jian Wushuang was truly beautiful and magnificent. It was hard to imagine someone in the Chaotic Realm performed such a move.

However, what was the use if the swordplay was merely visually beautiful?

Just as everyone was wondering...

Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

A total of six heads flew.

Their owners were none other than the six Divine Demon experts of Mu Clan. Although their heads flew off, their eyes were still puzzled by the sight they witnessed.

While their consciousness was fading, up to the moment they died they still could not figure out how it all happened.

At the same time, the frozen headless torsos directly fell downwards.

The surroundings became silent at that moment.

Both parties which were fighting just moments ago collectively stopped battling and multiple pairs of stunned eyes looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“T-this...”

Xiao Heng’s lips trembled when he spoke.

The other four core disciples were also dumbfounded.

Just one strike. It was just one perfectly gorgeous and magnificent strike.

They thought it was only visually stunning, but the result was the fall of six Divine Demons from Mu Clan!

“How is this possible?!”

A scream finally exploded.

Not only the experts of Mu Clan but Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were also completely blown away.

Jian Wushuang was only a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm and outer disciple of Narcissus Island. Just because of his special relationship with Elder Wujian—was just slightly special—that none in Xiao Heng’s group thought much about him.

In the current mission, Jian Wushuang had expressed his slightly different views and opinions, but nobody ever paid any attention to what he said.

They made decisions on their own without running them by Jian Wushuang because, in their minds, he was a good-for-nothing.

However, Jian Wushuang then made his move.

With just one strike of his sword, he slaughtered six Third-Class Divine Demons.

What level of ability was that?

“Not bad.”

Miss Xiao, who was standing in the middle of the battlefield while being protected by Xiao Heng and his men in a circle, had her eyes shining in amazement.

After killing six Third-Class Divine Demons with Cutting Snow’s first form, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as his figure moved, showing his insights toward Space-Time Law.

Two Space-Time Shadows appeared in the void, made a weird jump, and Jian Wushuang was already next to the Second-Class Divine Demon of Mu Clan.

“This speed... No!” The Second-Class Divine Demon of Mu Clan was startled but immediately adjusted himself.

“Second-Class Divine Demon isn’t as easy to kill as First-Class.” Jian Wushuang smiled in his mind. However, the Stellar Strength that had already merged into his entire body rose in a split second.

Ring!

Blood Mountain Sword stabbed forward. It was a straightforward strike, but carrying tremendous Samsara strength.

This form was called Samsara Empty Strike!

The sword shadow was blurry and stabbed directly at the Second-Class Divine Demon right in front of him.
