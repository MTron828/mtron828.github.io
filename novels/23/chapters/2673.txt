Chapter 2674: Won!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Space-time Blade Technique was a secret technique that one could master after reaching the second stage Space-time Law. It was an extremely powerful technique.

Theoretically, a single Space-time Blade was enough to easily kill a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God. Jian Wushuang made a breakthrough in his perception of Space-time Law and mastered his first Space-time Blade nine years ago. In the following nine years, he spent time cultivating the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique while also improving in his Space-time Law perception which somehow allowed him to display his second Space-time Blade during that period.

His ordinary sword movement became extremely terrifying when two Space-time Blades had been condensed in his sword.

Clang!

There was a loud noise and soon the purple-golden fleeting light that was madly charging forward immediately went dim such that even the Evolving Sky Godly Staff was thrown off.

Jian Wushuang then did a simple body jerk.

It was just a simple jerk without any apparition discharged but his figure teleported across and appeared next to Wu Xin.

“Why is it so fast?” Wu Xin looked astonished without even having time to react.

Jian Wushuang’s longsword struck.

Snap!

Wu Xin was sent flying away and the fight was over even though he was uninjured.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang withdrew his Blood Mountain Sword and smiled faintly.

Wu Xin on the other hand did not manage to react at all.

The people that were watching their fight were shocked and became speechless.

They were shocked when they saw Wu Xin’s real strength with thoughts that Wu Xin’s strength was too strong and Jian Wushuang probably had no chance of winning at all.

They were even more shocked when Wu Xin was defeated in the blink of an eye!

He was defeated too fast.

He was able to fight head-on with Jian Wushuang for a long time when he was relying on his laws perception and principles understanding. Why would he be defeated in such a jiffy when he did his best?

What could that possibly reflect?

“This Jian Yi...”

“A Peak Earth Ultimate God unexpectedly defeated a not ordinary Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God, but the pride of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion whose combat prowess was estimated to be comparable with High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods. That’s so unbelievable!”

“Jian Yi... Jian Yi, I feel like I’ve heard of this name before. Oh, I’ve recalled.” A Heaven Ultimate God expert from Sacred Palace suddenly exclaimed in horror. “It’s him. He’s the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, Jian Yi. He managed to resist attacks from three Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods while having the cultivation base of a Peak Earth Ultimate God decades ago who not only didn’t lose miserably but also made both Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect offer a reward of hundred million Primordial Stones to capture him!”

“Yes, it’s him!”

There was an uproar from the battlefield following Jian Wushuang’s identity announcement by the Heaven Ultimate God.

The black-robed old man from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion—Elder Teng was closely staring at Jian Wushuang from the surrounding void, dumbfounded. “It’s Space-time Blade. It turns out to be the Space-time Blade!”

“Jian Yi...” Palace Keeper Si Zhen also stared at Jian Wushuang in awe.

They were startled by the technique that Jian Wushuang displayed.

The Space-time Blade was a secret technique that one could master only after reaching the second stage Space-time Law.

Many Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods had never reached the Space-time Strangulation of the second stage Space-time Law, yet a Peak Earth Ultimate God such as Jian Yi managed to do it?

“He isn’t only well versed in Space-time Law, but he has also reached the second stage. His divine power also isn’t any weaker than an average Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God.” The black-robed old man’s expression looked cold. “This kid! His strength is far above Wu Xin, but was hiding his true potential from the beginning and gradually set his traps—allowing Wu Xin to fall victim in his plan to get a large number of Divine Elixir Pills from Wu Xin! What a cunning brat!”

Even the black-robed old man—Elder Teng who had reached the Grand Ultimate God level thought Jian Wushuang was cunning.

He had agreed with the 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills bet because he never thought Jian Wushuang could beat Wu Xin.

As a result, they fell into Jian Wushuang’s trap and were tricked into giving away so many Divine Elixir Pills. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Although he’s cunning, it’s undeniable he’s indeed very powerful. It’s unbelievable that a Peak Earth Ultimate God like him can reach this level of strength. This kid is an exceptional genius and much better than most of the experts from our Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. I’m afraid only one person from our Dragon Phoenix Pavilion can be his match,” murmured the black-robed old man.

Jian Wushuang had already stretched out his palm in the void up front. “Now, hand over one thousand Divine Elixir Pills.”

Wu Xin shuddered as he turned and searched for the black-robed old man’s gaze.

The black-robed old man frowned and slowly walked up.

“Young man, are you Jian Yi?” The black-robed old man studied Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and behaved humbly around the Grand Ultimate God.

the black-robed old man asked, “You’re indeed very powerful. Are you interested in joining my Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen who was next to him grunted his dissatisfaction when he heard that. “Brother Teng, aren’t you a bit too much? It’s so hard to finally have such a genius in my Sacred Palace and you still want to take him away?”

“Haha, I just casually asked. Palace Keeper Si Zhen, don’t be angry just yet. This young man here may not be willing.” The black-robed old man smiled.

“I’m really not very interested in joining the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion, so I’d better stay in the Sacred Palace,” replied Jian Wushuang conveniently.

The black-robed old man’s face stiffened and could only smile awkwardly at the situation.

“Brother Teng, you’ll have to give away the Divine Elixir Pills. A thousand Divine Elixir Pills are nothing but a drop of water in the bucket for the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Of course.” The black-robed old man smiled before taking out an Interspatial ring and handed it to Jian Wushuang. “Little guy, these are the one thousand Divine Elixir Pills you’ve just won. A thousand Divine Elixir Pills are nothing to the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. Perhaps you can reconsider it carefully. You’ll have everything you need if you join the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. You can have as many resources as you need.”

“Brother Teng.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s face sank and was getting a little annoyed.

“Haha, alright. Alright!” The black-robed old man waved his hand again.

The black-robed old man then led Wu Xin into the Space-time Palace whilst Jian Wushuang happily left upon receiving his Divine Elixir Pills.

At the Space-time Palace.

“Elder Teng, I’m useless. I’m sorry to have let you down.” Wu Xin blamed himself.

“This matter isn’t your fault and you’re not useless. You met an extraordinary opponent. He’s genuinely an exceptional genius and perhaps only one person in the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow could defeat him,” said the black-robed old man.

“You mean Junior Sister Leng?” Wu Xin was startled.

“It’s her, but it’s a pity your Junior Sister Leng is too talented. She’s not someone my Dragon Phoenix Pavilion can house.” The black robe old man secretly sighed.
