Chapter 1109: Forced to Retreat!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Experts from the Green Fire Palace!”

As Jian Wushuang and the two Celestial Masters dashed toward them, the two experts from the Jin Kingdom noticed their presence.

“Humph, Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long are only middle-ranking, while the other one is just a useless Eternal Realm rookie. No need to bother about them, let’s continue chasing our target. Celestial Master Jin Qu is worth exactly three Life Elixirs!” exclaimed one of the Jin Kingdom experts, a purple-haired burly man.

The experts from the Jin Kingdom also had some knowledge of a few Celestial Masters from the Green Fire Palace; it was how they identified Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long.

The eyes of the other expert were also focused upon Celestial Master Jin Qu. The speed of both pursuers did not decrease in the least bit.

This surprised Jian Wushuang and his companions.

“Why are they still in pursuit after noticing our presence? What foolhardiness!” said Celestial Master Yi with a chilly gaze.

“One of them is an advanced Celestial Master, while the other a middle-ranking one. How dare they be so conceited?” added Celestial Master Meng Long, rage burning in his eyes as well.

“Leave the advanced Celestial Master to me. I’ll let you guys handle the middle-ranking one,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Right,” said Celestial Master Yi, nodding.

“No problem,” added Celestial Master Meng Long.

They had personally witnessed Jian Wushuang’s strength, and it was because of his presence that they remarked about the foolishness of the two Jin Kingdom experts.

Shortly after, the three of them met up with the experts from the Jin Kingdom.

Jian Wushuang was holding onto the Blood Mountain Sword; it was bursting with strong power. He charged before his companions and slashed with the sword when he got close enough to touch his opponent.

“Heaven’s Bane!” he exclaimed.

A majestic ray of sword light of pure Yang energy sliced through the Void in front of it, and a golden thunderbolt merged with it as it shot out, causing it to become more piercing to his opponent’s eyes. It also increased the pressure felt by the expert from the Jin Kingdom.

“Piss off, you foolish, useless thing!” the purple-haired burly advanced Celestial Master roared.

He struck his palm out with amazing quickness.

The force equivalent to a thunderclap was contained in his move; it was extremely powerful as well.

Even though the burly man acted as though he did not think much of Jian Wushuang, he dared not take his opponent’s attack lightly. Evidently, he had utilized a Secret Skill of his.

The two huge forces, each containing electrical energy, clashed head-on.

“Bam!”

With an ear-splitting boom, wave after wave of electrical power was unleashed into the surrounding Void, shredding it into pieces. It felt as though heaven and earth had split open.

“Hmm?” the burly man’s expression changed. He could feel a sharp pain emanating from his palm as his figure stumbled backward uncontrollably. When he raised his head again, he noticed that Jian Wushuang had already struck again.

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Jian Wushuang struck four times with his sword. Each move was immensely powerful and brought huge pressure to his opponent.

Jian Wushuang infused each strike with a golden thunderbolt, causing their power to be greatly increased.

The Level Three Divine Yin Thunder… had increased his attack capability to its peak.

The burly man wore a serious expression on his face. This time, he returned the favor with both hands. His palms, which were encased in scarlet boxing gloves, surged with electrical power.

“Shocking Thunder Palm!”

“Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!”

The man struck four times with his palms as well, also unleashing all of his power as an advanced Celestial Master.

Even so, his figure was still knocked backward by the impact of the clash, and his arms felt incredibly numb.

“How could I, an advanced Celestial Master, not be on par with this kid in terms of offensive power?”?the burly man thought. He looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise before turning around and fleeing.

As he did so, he left a voice message for his comrade to leave quickly as well.

Jian Wushuang had no intention of chasing after the burly man. Instead, he turned his gaze toward the other battle which was still raging on.

The Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long were facing off against the other expert from the Jin Kingdom.

The expert was only a medium Celestial Master, and his strength was close to his opponents. If it was a one-on-one fight, he would not be afraid, but he was facing two opponents now. Furthermore, Celestial Master Jin Qu still had some battle strength left in him, and he was still eyeing for an opportunity to strike back. All these factors caused the Jin Kingdom expert to defend clumsily.

He had originally hoped that his partner could come to his aid after dispatching the Eternal Realm expert, but surprisingly, the burly man had lost to Jian Wushuang and even fled immediately after.

“Damn it!”

His expression changed drastically; he was still in shock. The only thing on his mind was to retreat as well.

His opponents were, however, hell-bent on catching him. Just at this moment, Jian Wushuang also came charging toward him.

“With my current strength, it’ll still be hard for me to completely subdue an advanced Celestial Master, but it’s more than enough to handle a middle-ranking one,”?thought Jian Wushuang as his eyes gleamed with murderous intent. He unleashed his swordsmanship on his opponent as he was drawing near.

An extremely beautiful yet mournful looking sword light formed, and a terrible consciousness attack mixed with Killing Intent shot toward the middle-ranking Celestial Master of the Jin Kingdom.

Faced with the sudden attack, the Celestial Master’s consciousness was muddled in an instant, and he could do nothing as the sword light sliced his head off.

Out of the two experts that were pursuing Celestial Master Jin Qu, one was dead now and the other had already fled.

The experts from the Green Fire Palace gathered in the Void.

“Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long,” greeted Celestial Master Jin Qu. He then turned his gaze in surprise to Jian Wushuang. “This esteemed fellow, then, should be our new comrade and young friend Jian Wushuang, right?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s me,” replied Jian Wushuang with a slight nod.

“I’m Jin Qu. I’m indebted to you three for your help today,” the Celestial Master said in gratitude.

“It’s no big deal. Furthermore, both Celestial Master Meng Long and I did not do anything much. If you really wish to thank someone, you should thank our young friend here. If it wasn’t for him, we would have been unable to force the advanced Celestial Master of the Jin Kingdom to retreat, much less kill the other middle-ranking one,” said Celestial Master Yi cheerfully.

“Yes, it’s all thanks to our young friend, Jian Wushuang,” said Celestial Master Jin Qu. He thanked the Eternal Realm expert profusely, but he wore a strange look on his face.

He had heard about Jian Wushuang before and knew about his background. He even knew that Jian Wushuang had just joined the Green Fire Palace, and that even though he was an Eternal Realm expert, his battle strength was on par with a medium Celestial Master.

That was what he knew.

“Now that I’ve finally met him, isn’t his actual strength much greater than reported?”?he thought.

“Wasn’t Jian Wushuang’s ability just supposed to be on par with that of a medium Celestial Master? So how could he defeat an advanced Celestial Master in direct combat?”?Celestial Master Jin Qu was extremely puzzled.
