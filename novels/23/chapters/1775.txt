Chapter 1776: Appointment

“If so, Soaring Heaven King Palace can’t do anything about Jian Wushuang?”

Everyone in Soaring Heaven King Palace looked distressed.

“If we want to kill him, it is impossible as of now. But it isn’t difficult if we only want Jian Wushuang to retreat,” Emperor God Tian Xiao squinted his eyes. “Send down my command. For the rest of the time, we of Soaring Heaven King Palace shall stay put in the old lair. Without my permission, no one gets to leave.”

“Yes,” the underlings immediately took the order.

…

In Soaring Heaven Land, Jian Wushuang’s massacre continued.

However, as Soaring Heaven King Palace summoned all their experts back, it was very difficult for Jian Wushuang to find a target.

However, Soaring Heaven King Palace’s action shook Sanctuary Alliance.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace summoned all their experts back to Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent?”

“Does Soaring Heaven King Palace intend to ostrich and have all the experts under their command hide in their old lair?”

“Impossible. Soaring Heaven King Palace has always been arrogant. Their foundation and power is extraordinary. With Jian Wushuang alone, it will be impossible for him to force Soaring Heaven King Palace into such a position. If I’m not mistaken, Soaring Heaven King Palace definitely has their way to deal with Jian Wushuang.”

“We shall see.”

The experts from various forces watched quietly.

The time flew past. One month, two months, half a year… Soaring Heaven King Palace was extremely peaceful and there were no experts above Real God-level who left the old lair.

The experts from all forces in Sanctuary Alliance was confused.

Soaring Heaven King Palace really can’t do anything about Jian Wushuang and they decided to be an ostrich?

Just as most experts thought, Soaring Heaven King Palace finally made a move.

Soaring Heaven King Palace spread news that Emperor God Tian Xiao would throw a banquet in Clear Sky City on Soaring Heaven Land in one month’s time to see Jian Wushuang personally.

The moment the news spread, everyone was shocked.

Some said that Soaring Heaven King Palace meant that they had already set up a trap to kill Jian Wushuang and they were only waiting for his arrival.

Some even said that Soaring Heaven King Palace couldn’t do anything about Jian Wushuang. Hence, they had no choice but to talk to Jian Wushuang. In other words, Soaring Heaven King Palace yielded to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, who was the main character of the incident, naturally received the news at the first instant.

“To meet me?”

Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose and there was a malicious smile.

“Jian Wushuang, Soaring Heaven King Palace has always been barbaric. Ever since Emperor God Tian Ling and Emperor God Tian Xiao established Soaring Heaven King Palace, they have only bowed to Great Emperors or experts like Underworld God. But now, although you have made Soaring Heaven King Palace suffered a great loss, the two greatest authorities, especially Emperor God Tian Ling, are still alive. They definitely won’t yield to you so easily. Hence, this meetup might be a trap,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Trap?” Jian Wushuang thought for a while and asked, “Hall Master Yuan, is there any news about Emperor God Tian Ling’s return?”

“No. I have someone to guard at the Second Lair. I am sure that Emperor God Tian Ling is still in the Second Lair,” Hall Master Yuan answered.

“How about the other experts on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s strange. The experts of Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, besides the Sir God who was further back on the list that has always stayed in Soaring Heaven Land, there aren’t any other experts who have returned to Soaring Heaven Land,” Hall Master Yuan said.

When Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace had fought head-on, Hall Master Yuan utilized Lineage of Star and used the resources in Sanctuary Alliance to keep watch of experts who could threaten Jian Wushuang. However, he didn’t receive any news about any experts who went to Soaring Heaven Land.

“Emperor God Tian Ling didn’t return, nor did the experts on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list come back. How can Soaring Heaven King Palace kill me? Could it be with other trump cards?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. “No way, if Soaring Heaven King Palace could really play any trump cards that could threaten me, they would have played them long ago. They definitely wouldn’t wait until now. What could it be?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even Jian Wushuang had no idea what Soaring Heaven King Palace’s intention was.

“Regardless of Soaring Heaven King Palace’s intention, it’s best that you don’t go for the meetup,” Hall Master Yuan advised.

“No, Soaring Heaven King Palace invited me sincerely, how can I not go? No matter what their plot is, even if there is a trap, I, Jian Wushuang, will deal with it,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

One should know that, even when he was the target of a scheme by Acheron Palace back in Buddhist Demon Sea, he made a narrow escape and survived. His power increased tremendously too.

If Acheron Palace was capable of that, Jian Wushuang didn’t think Soaring Heaven King Palace could be more clever than Acheron Palace.

Plus, Jian Wushuang was confident in his trump cards too.

“If you insist to go, go ahead. But just in case, I will report this to Palace Master and have Palace Master make a trip to Soaring Heaven Land. If there were to be any unexpected events, Soaring Heaven King Palace wouldn’t dare to attack hastily if Palace Master were to be there,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded and made a decision.

…

One month later, it was clear and fresh.

On Soaring Heaven Land, in Clear Sky City, countless cultivators were gathered.

The cultivators were naturally there to watch Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace’s meetup.

In the void above Clear Sky City, there was a pedestal floating in the air quietly. On the pedestal, there were two long, narrow tables. In front of one of the tables, a man in a golden robe sat with his eyes closed.

The man in the golden robe was Emperor God Tian Xiao’s original body!

The cultivators gathered in Clear Sky City saw Emperor God Tian Xiao and they looked at him in awe.

“Emperor God Tian Xiao is one of the founders of Soaring Heaven King Palace!”

“Such a legendary figure, I can finally see him with my own eyes. I can die with no regrets now.”

“Although Emperor God Tian Xiao was amazing, I admire Jian Wushuang more. He is only in the realm of Real God and he can shake Soaring Heaven King Palace. It is said that Emperor God Tian Xiao could only be evenly matched with him.”

Countless cultivators were talking among themselves.

Just then…

“Haha, Emperor God Tian Xiao, I’m sorry to make you wait,” there was a burst of hearty laughter that reverberated in the universe.

Then, there was a figure in a crimson robe that appeared and walked over from the void far away.

He was walking slowly but every step he took brought about a mysterious boundless divine might that was not second to Emperor God Tian Xiao. It spread along his footsteps.

Countless cultivators lifted their heads simultaneously. Looking at the incomer, their eyes were filled with admiration and passion.

It took a while until the figure in crimson reached the pedestal and came before Emperor God Tian Xiao.

Emperor God Tian Xiao, who had been sitting there with his eyes closed, finally opened his eyes. He looked at Jian Wushuang solemnly and waved his hand.

“Take a seat!”

Jian Wushuang then sat down by the side of the empty long, narrow table in front of him.
