Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Thank you, senior.”

Jian Wushuang understood what Ma Yi meant. After communicating with Ma Yi, he immediately took out Temple Master Bai Xing’s message token.

“An expert of the sixth realm of the void who specializes in the soul?” Temple Master Bai Xing was a little surprised. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, why are you asking this?”

“Of course it’s something very important. Do you know about it, Temple Master Bai Xing?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“There are not many experts of the six realms of the void in the Divine Beginning Realm, and those who specialize in the soul are even rarer. One of them is the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Forget about the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan. I killed her daughter. There’s no way to resolve the enmity between us,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Aside from the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan, there’s only one person I know who can fulfill your request,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“It’s spirit ancestor from the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect!” Temple Master Bai Xing said seriously, “The Divine Ancestor Daoist sect is one of the three Freedom Alliances like our Temporal Temple. Its overall strength is huge, and there are many top experts. Spirit ancestor is one of the top experts in the

Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect!”

“This spirit ancestor has long reached the level of the six states of the Void, and it is said that she has already reached the peak of the six states of the void. and her best technique is soul attacks. Her attainments in the aspect of the soul are definitely one of the best in the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

Even compared to the Nine-tailed Clan’s grandmaster, she is probably on par.

“She should be able to satisfy your request. However, this spirit ancestor has an extremely cold and aloof personality. She does not care about the affairs of the world. She is clearly one of the top experts of the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect and has a very high status in the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect.

She has even obtained the title of ‘ancestor’. However, there are no experts under her command. Therefore, among the nine ancestors of the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, the spirit ancestor is the weakest. She is basically an empty shell.

“It will be difficult for you to ask her for help.”

Hearing Temple Master Bai Xing’s words, Jian Wushuang smiled. “It’s difficult, but it doesn’t mean that there’s no hope. It just so happens that I have some conflicts with the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. I had planned to go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect when I had time, but now it’s just in time. In that

case, I’ll go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect now.”

Jian Wushuang did have some connection with the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.

‘When Jian Wushuang was just a Divine Master in the endless territories, he entered the secret realm of a mysterious expert by chance! Is the Heavenly Ancestor Taoist Temple Blood Clan line under the rule of the Master Xue Bei!

In the secret realm of heaven and earth of Xue Bei, Jian Wushuang had a great opportunity. Even the Peerless Sword Manual was created in the secret realm of heaven and earth of Xue Bei. He had promised Xue Bei that he would go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect on his behalf.

However, for various reasons, he had not gone before. This time, it was obvious that he had to go.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, please send me the information of the sects and experts of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wait a moment.”

In just a moment, Temple Master Bai Xing sent a large amount of information, and Jian Wushuang immediately began to browse through it.

“It’s also one of the three Freedom Alliances, but there are so many factions in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect?” Jian Wushuang looked at the information and was secretly amazed.

Although most of the forces or sects appeared to be an iron bucket, in fact, there were some internal struggles for benefits.

It was the same for the sects of the weaker forces, but the internal struggles for benefits were even greater for the top forces and sects.

For example, the three Saint Realms often fought against each other, but did the three Saint Realms not usually compete and kill each other?

In the three Freedom Alliances, the Temporal Temple had too few experts and was always more united, so it was a bit special. It was only a competition for some small benefits, and there were no factions.

But the other two Freedom Alliances, like the Heaven -cleaving Alliance!

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance also had two great factions. One of the great factions was led by the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Palace, while the other great faction was led by the two famous heaven severing divine generals of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, it was said that the two

Heaven-cleaving divine generals were both top experts at the sixth realm of the void. They also had many resources under their command. They could completely contend with the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Palace.

As for the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, there were even more factions!

Among them, the famous nine ancestors were the nine largest factions!

For these nine ancestors to be able to be called ‘ancestors’, each of them had astonishing strength. The weakest were usually experts at the peak of the fifth level of the void, and a few of them had even reached the sixth level of the void.

A total of nine great factions coexisted, and it was very difficult to achieve absolute fairness in the distribution of some of the resources within the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect. Thus, naturally, they had to compete and fight.

Only the sect that was like spirit ancestor, which did not care about worldly affairs and did not have any experts under it, was special. The other eight sects fought fiercely, including Xue Bei’s Blood Ancestor Sect.

“Among the nine sects of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, four of them are the strongest and have experts of the six void realms overseeing them. The Blood Ancestor Sect is one of them.” Jian Wushuang read the message sent by Temple Master Bai Xing. “If I want to go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect

and ask for the help of the spirit ancestor, I can go to the blood ancestor’s branch and finish what Xue Bei asked me to do.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. Then he took out another token, which belonged to his good friend Jiu Luo.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, when did you remember me?” Jiu Luo replied.

“Jiu Luo, you should be a disciple of the Dao Palace now, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jiu Luo came to the Third Heaven with him through the white bone field. Later, because of Jiu Luo, Jian Wushuang had some dealings with the people of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.

“Tam. Although I am not a top-level disciple of the Dao Palace, my status is not bad,” Jiu Luo said with a smile.

“Then you should be able to contact Bai Jue for me, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. Why? Do you need something from Master Bai Jue?” Jiu Luo asked, puzzled.

“Yes, I need something from him. Give him the message token for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wait a moment, then.” Jiu Luo quickly went to find Bai Jue. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bai Jue was a Principles Master of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. He was also in charge of some matters of the Dao Palace. His status in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect was not low. Jian Wushuang had not had much contact with the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect before. Among the only people he had

interacted with…Bai Jue was the strongest among them.

Before long, Jiu Luo found Bai Jue and handed him the message token..
