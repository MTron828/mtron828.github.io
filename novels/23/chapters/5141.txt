Chapter 5145 - 5145: Battle of the Emperors

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Daogong, Liu Ya, Fenghua.” Zhen Wuyang appeared ordinary among the group of Emperors, but his words were exceptionally domineering.

“I have come specifically to pay respects to you Seniors.”

Although he said it was a greeting, he brought a large group of Emperors, making it impossible to move in the Qishen Temple hall.

“Dong Yan, your Yan Divine Array can be set up now,” Zhen Wuyang said, turning his head and smiling.

He had just said he came to pay respects, but he turned around and had Dong Yan set up the array. Zhen Wuyang’s shamelessness embarrassed the Emperors who saw him for the first time.

Indeed, he was a formidable presence that could destroy the entire Great Si Region during that proud Ancient Era.

He had been ruthless when annihilating his own people in the past. Now, cooperating with him, Emperor Donglin sighed inwardly, unsure if it was good or bad.

The Yan Divine Array was created by Emperor Dong Yan himself. It had a great reputation in the surrounding domains. Once the array was formed, even Emperors couldn’t teleport through the void.

Buzz!

“Array formation, rise!” Emperor Dong Yan waved the flag, and a diagram comparable to a small world descended from the sky, suppressing a third of the void in the Great Desolate Wilderness.

After the large array was set up, Zhen Wuyang’s concerns dissipated. At least those old fellows from the Ancient Era couldn’t escape now.

Besides the Yan Divine Array guarding, Heaven-Reaching Buddha also took out the precious Thousand Treasures Kasaya.

Everything outside was clear to the Emperors inside the Qishen Temple. They weren’t idle either, immediately activating the power of the Qishen Temple.

Boom!

The Yan Divine Array buzzed in the void. Every component of the huge diagram accelerated its rotation. Although the power of the Qishen Temple was strong, those Emperors couldn’t fully unleash their power. Relying on the Qishen Temple, they could only barely contend with many Emperors.

“Liu Ya, get ready to attack!” Daogong shouted angrily. His figure appeared outside the main gate of the Qishen Temple, and an ancient and majestic aura rose into the sky.

The runes outside the Qishen Temple lit up instantly. Daogong’s eyes were dazzling as he rushed toward Dong Yan inside the Yan Divine Array.

The countless corpses surrounding the hall, acting as the outermost defense, turned into powder when a divine force swept over them. They floated toward the Qishen Temple along the ancient road of Immortal bones.

The two Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, the Shadow Demons, guarding outside the temple suddenly opened their eyes.

They had been waiting for this moment for too long. This was their Lord, Liu Ya, summoning them.

“Set up the formation!” Liu Ya’s eyes flickered. He gently pressed his left hand, and his blood-red arm suddenly burst with power. This force stirred millions of Grand Yan Immortals.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

“Welcome, My Lord!”

36 Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals appeared instantly behind Liu Ya. These Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals used the corpses of billions of Grand Yan Immortals as their bodies, and the endless

Grand Yan Immortals ultimately transformed into the flesh and blood of these 36 experts.

At this point, they had surpassed the realm of Grand Yan Immortals. Each of them possessed the aura of an Emperor, but the Dao within their bodies had withered when they condensed their flesh and blood. Now, they were all like living dead.

“Activate the formation!” Liu Ya roared again.

The grand formation rose, and a colossal figure the size of the Qishen Temple appeared outside the Qishen Temple. This was the dead spirit formation set up by Liu Ya.

Liu Ya obtained this formation from inside the Qi God Temple. During the ancient times, he pursued the Qi God Dao wholeheartedly but never practiced it. It wasn’t until True Martial Yang rose that he bezan practicinz. He didn’t hesitate to let billions of Great Yan Immortals accompany him in death just to perfect this formation. Now, the revived Great Yan Immortals were becoming a part of him, ready to battle for him.

“Daogong, quickly kill Dong Yan and break the formation. The rest of you, suppress Heaven-Reaching Buddha together. Leave the rest to me.” Liu Ya directed the entire dead spirit formation. The human-shaped figures formed by the formation also bore his appearance.

Boom!

Daogong, who had cultivated the Qishen Dao to the eighth level, was indeed fast. Even though the void was sealed, his speed was much faster than Emperor Dong Yan’s. In an instant, he arrived at the location of Dong Yan within the formation.

The formation blockade worked both ways. Dong Yan himself couldn’t use instant teleportation; he had to rely on the large formation at the formation’s core and confront Daogong head-on.

“I heard you were the leader of the Great Si Region during the Ancient Era. Today, I will properly face you.” Although Dong Yan’s strength hadn’t reached the tier 4, he had the defense of the core formation. Against an old guy who had just entered tier 4, he had some confidence.

“I happen to want to meet you, these foreign realm experts, too. Let’s see if your Dao is stronger or mine.” As soon as Daogong finished speaking, he attacked directly.

Once the leader during the Ancient Era, Daogong was already a tier 3 Emperor back then. Now, he had advanced further to become a tier 4 Emperor and received blessings from Qishen. His strength was comparable to Zhen Wuyang of the ancient times.

The current Emperor Dong Yan didn’t pose a threat to him.

A whisk appeared in Daogong’s hand. With a gentle wave, countless white feathers surrounded the entire core formation, then suddenly tightened.

The pressure from the whisk felt like a giant’s palm, but Dong Yan at the formation’s core remained calm and held onto the core formation tightly.

Under the immense pressure, the core formation’s operation sped up rapidly.

“This won’t last much longer if it continues like this,” Dong Yan exclaimed in horror and quickly transmitted a message to Heaven-Reaching Buddha, “Dao Gong is of the fourth tier. I can’t hold on. Quickly have Feng MO save me.”

Heaven-Reaching Buddha, Zhen Wuyang, Donglin Divine Emperor, and Feng MO, four tier 4 Emperors.

16 Palace-Protecting Divine Generals suppressed Heaven-Reaching Buddha in the Qishen Temple. Although it was said to be a suppression, they were actually keeping an eye on him. It was best for both sides not to make a move and wait for others to determine the outcome.

In the current Qishen Temple, Liu Ya, the strongest figure, resisted 3 fourth-tier Emperors alone.

After all, the Great Desolate Wilderness was Liu Ya’s Dao Arena. While Feng MO was powerful, he had just entered the fourth tier and wasn’t as strong as Daogong. Only Zhen Wuyang’s strength was formidable enough to contend with him.

As for Donglin Divine Emperor, he guarded the rear and protected many ordinary Emperors. In battles at this level, those ordinary Emperors couldn’t even intervene. They became burdens instead, wasting the power of a fourth-tier Emperor for nothing.

With the power from the Dao Arena and the Dead Spirit Formation, Liu Ya now had the strength of an excellent tier 4 Emperor. No matter how strong Zhen Wuyang was, he couldn’t gain any advantage from Liu Ya.

“Zhen Wuyang, I originally thought you would come to the Great Desolate Wilderness alone, but I didn’t expect you to bring so many helpers. You truly disappoint me!” Liu Ya said as he attacked.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Enormous fist shadows fell like shooting stars, bombarding Emperor Feng Mo.

Meanwhile, Zhen Wuyang mainly targeted the weakest link. This was his Dao Arena; the more he fought, the stronger he would become. He could mobilize the Great Desolate Wilderness’s Heavenly Dao. He was the Dao Ancestor of this world. Although it was only a middle-grade world, the power it bestowed upon him could still shatter Feng MO’s divine body..
