Too fast!

Before the tall man could react, he was killed by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

This scene made the evil-looking young man and the white-haired elder change their expressions.

The tall man was the strongest among the three of them in terms of direct combat ability. However, he did not even have the chance to struggle in front of Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, an unprecedented fear emerged in the hearts of the two Rulers.

“Run!”

The white-haired elder roared and immediately turned around to flee.

The death of the tall man was too much of a shock to him.

Although he had come to this territory under the orders of the Devil Cloud Star Master, who wanted to protect the three Saint Realms, it did not mean that he would risk his life for the three Saint Realms. He was a Ruler, he valued his life very much.

Moreover, the strength displayed by the other party in this battle was not something he could fight against.

As soon as the white-haired elder fled, the evil-looking young man immediately fled as well.

“Can you escape?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. “Temporal!”

“Leave it to me,” the Temporal Temple Master said loudly. Then, he saw the vast power of the rule covering the white-haired elder and the evil-looking young man.

This power of principles was vast and majestic, and it had a huge restriction on the white-haired old man and the young man.

Even though the young man had activated the power of principles to resist it, it was clear that the Temporal Temple Master had the absolute advantage in the battle against the Temporal Temple Master.

“How is this possible? How can the Temporal Temple Master’s control of the laws of space and time be so amazing?” The young man was shocked.

Temporal Temple Master burst into laughter, “Haha, your use of the power of spacetime principles is slightly inferior to mine. Now that I’m in the Divine Beginning Realm, my understanding of the use of spacetime in this world and my ability to use the strongest power of principles under the suppression of the Heavenly Dao is as clear as the palm of my hand.”

“How can you fight me in this situation?”

Temporal Temple Master’s laughter echoed throughout the void.

His laughter made the evil-looking young man pale, because he had noticed that Jian Wushuang was chasing after him.

If he was at his peak and did not have Temporal Temple Master’s suppression, he would have been able to escape from Jian Wushuang. But now, his strength was completely underestimated, and his speed was greatly reduced by the suppression of spacetime, he could only watch as Jian Wushuang caught up with him.

Then, Jian Wushuang attacked with lightning speed.

With just a few strikes, the evil-looking young man was killed by Jian Wushuang in a head-on fight.

“There’s only one left.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with a shocking killing intent. His eyes had already locked onto the white-haired elder in the void not far away.

Because he was chasing after the evil-looking young man, the white-haired elder had already fled a certain distance, but this distance was still under the Temporal Temple Master’s time and space suppression.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang used his fastest speed and caught up with the elder in just a moment.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, don’t go too far!”

The elder’s face was cold and his eyes were extremely cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Go too far?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He had killed the tall man and the evil-looking young man, so he should have been able to kill the white-haired elder easily. However, the latter dared to say such threatening words to him, this made Jian Wushuang feel that something was wrong.

“Could it be?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, but a cold smile appeared on his face. “It seems that Devil Cloud Star Master not only sent you three Rulers to this territory, but also gave you the special treasure, right? Is it in your hands now?”

The white-haired elder looked gloomy and did not speak.

Jian Wushuang was right. He did have a trump card, which was the special treasure that Devil Cloud Star Master gave him. The special treasure was extremely effective against special life forms and possessed extraordinary power.

The special treasure had played a great role in Xuan Yi’s death during the world-ending battle.

However, Devil Cloud Star Master was the one who had killed Xuan Yi. He was the one who had personally controlled the treasure.

However, the treasure in his hands could not exert its strongest power. If he were in the universe void, his strength would not be restricted. He could barely exert a certain amount of the treasure’s power.

But now, in the Divine Beginning Realm, his strength was limited to only one-tenth. Under such circumstances, although he could use the treasure, the price was too high, so high that it was difficult for him to bear.

Therefore, in the Divine Beginning Realm, he did not want to use the strongest treasure unless it was absolutely necessary.

But now, if Jian Wushuang continued to be aggressive, he had no other choice.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you just want to kill the three Saint Realm Masters. There’s no need to kill me. Otherwise, if you really force me, you won’t have a good life,” the elder with white hair shouted in a deep voice.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You’re too conceited. If you don’t have the treasure, I can spare your life as long as you kowtow and beg for mercy. But since you have the treasure, you deserve to die!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate at all.

He did not have much killing intent toward the white-haired elder. Previously, he only wanted to kill him because he came from the Devil Cloud Star.

But now, since he mentioned the special treasure, Jian Wushuang had to kill him.

He was very interested in the special treasure in the white-haired elder’s hand!

That treasure had a great restraining effect on special life forms. It was a nemesis to special life forms. Therefore, he had to destroy it.

Even if he could not destroy it, he could not let the white-haired elder take it back to the Magic Cloud Planet!

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang did not want to waste any more time with the white-haired elder. With a flash of his body, he charged forward, and a shocking sword essence instantly swept out.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you’re courting death!”

The white-haired elder looked like he was going crazy. When he saw Jian Wushuang charging toward him, his eyes turned scarlet.

Buzz! A special wave suddenly spread out.

A black spear with a special aura appeared in the hand of the white-haired elder. It was the spear that had killed Xuan Yi. “...”
