Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Before a lofty mountain near the door of Thunder Fire Sect.

“Mister, this is White Flame Palace’s campsite near Thunder Fire Sect. All four Real Gods of White Flame Palace are in there,” Thunder Fire Sect Master said.

Behind the elderly in the purple robe, there were higher-ups from Thunder Fire Sect.

Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang stood at the front.

Lei Chao folded his arms as he overlooked the lofty mountain before him with a cold gaze.

When they appeared, the experts in the mountain shook that instance.

There were figures of experts that soared up in the sky one after another. Among the crowds of experts from White Flame Place, there were four leading figures.

From the aura that the four figures gave out, they were far beyond the level of a Universe God. They were obviously the Four Real Gods from White Flame Palace.

“Haha, Old Man Zi Qiu, I thought you’d hide for the rest of your life. I never thought that you would ever come to me,” a perverse bald man said in disdain as he smiled maliciously.

“The person who is speaking now is the solo expert that White Flame Palace hired. He is the strongest among the four Real Gods from White Flame Palace. Even if their chief comes, he might not be his match. The elderly with crane hair next to him is the Palace Master of White Flame Palace,” Thunder Fire Sect Master Zi Qiu said with a low voice.

“Mm,” Lei Chao nodded faintly.

The four Real Gods from White Flame Palace noticed Lei Chao’s existence from the opposite.

“Humph, no wonder he dared to show up. He found help. However, you thought you had found a Real God and Thunder Fire Sect would be fine?” The perverse bald man laughed. Although he could tell that it wasn’t wise to provoke Lei Chao, he didn’t care much because he was confident with his own capability.

“Mister, what do you we do now?” Zi Qiu asked.

“You just watch from here,” Lei Chao replied briefly and suddenly moved.

Swoosh!

When Lei Chao’s figure appeared again, he was already before the perverse bald man. His right index finger flashed with light when he pointed.

A terrifying, damaging aura suddenly erupted.

The damaging aura was fierce and the four Real God from White Flame Palace revealed a face of terror.

Lei Chao’s index finger became bigger in size in the perverse bald man’s eyes. He couldn’t give any response.

Psst!

The light went through in between the perverse bald man’s eyebrows. The perverse bald man couldn’t even let out a groan before he was killed.

The sight shocked everyone at the scene.

“How is that possible?”

The experts from White Flame Palace were all dumbfounded.

“Merely a finger and he killed a Real God?” Zi Qiu stared.

“This…” Jian Wushuang revealed a face of terror.

It was Jian Wushuang’s first time to see a Real God take action personally and it was also his first time seeing a Real God killed with his own eyes.

He was even killed instantly without any space of struggle.

He finally understood why the two Real Gods Wu Chen and Kong Jing in Lion Heart Town would revere Lei Cha.

They were all Real Gods but their difference was vast.

Hong!

After killing the perverse bald man with one finger, Lei Chao took action like lightning again.

Psst! Psst!

Followed by another two soft thuds, another two figures fell.

The four Real Gods from White Flame Palace, Lei Chao killed three of them in an instant. The remaining one was the Palace Master of White Flame Palace, the only one alive.

Of course, the reason why he was alive was that Lei Chao didn’t intend to kill him.

“You, you…” the Palace Master of White Flame Palace’s face was covered in terror. He stared at Lei Chao and finally uttered a question, “Who, are you exactly?”

“Lineage of Star, Lei Chao,’ Lei Chao didn’t hide his identity.

The Palace Master of White Flame Palace was suddenly wide open, “The expert on the Real God list, Lei Chao?”

“How is this possible? How is the Thunder Fire Sect be related to an expert like you?”

“It’s impossible!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Palace Master of White Flame Palace started bellowing.

“Palace Master of White Flame Palace,” Lei Chao’s voice was cold, “Follow my instruction and I give leave White Flame Palace a way out.”

The Palace Master of White Flame Palace immediately calmed down.

He knew that it was not the time for sorrow and fear but most importantly, to focus on keeping White Flame Palace alive.

Lei Chao took out the name list that he had obtained from Thunder Fire Sect.

“I have a name list here. Whoever gets his name called out, stand out on your own.”

“First one, Luo Xu!”

Lei Chao’s cold voice reverberated in the lofty mountain.

A large number of experts from White Flame Palace gathered in the mountain. The most outstanding experts were all gathered here.

When the Universe God in the First Heaven named Luo Xu heard Lei Chao’s voice, although he was terrified, he stood up.

“Luo Xu, it is very simple. I will give you and also everyone in White Flame Palace a chance to live, if… If you can defeat him!” Luo Xu pointed Jian Wushuang and said, “Otherwise, you can only die. White Flame Palace could only be destroyed entirely!”

“Defeat him?”

The Universe God in the First Heaven named Luo Xu immediately looked towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang already stood out then and he looked rather calm.

When Lei Chao asked for a name list of experts from White Flame Palace, he had a faint idea of Lei Chao’s plan.

Obviously, Lei Chao intended to use the experts from White Flame Palace to determine his ability.

After all, although he had passed through the fourteenth floor in Nine Boundaries Tower and the fifth floor in Inadvertent Dreamland, those were focused on unique skills and consciousness. They had nothing to do with one’s real power.

Jian Wushuang became a disciple of Star Palace through the test which the founder of the Lineage of Star had created. It was different from other disciples from Star Palace. It was only normal that a higher up in the Lineage of Star wanted to know his real power.

“Jian Wushuang, as Lei Chao wanted to determine your level of power. Give your all and don’t hide. After all, the Lineage of Star higher up would allocate resources according to the power and talent that you show. If you were to reveal stronger capabilities, the more benefits you would to receive,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily as his gaze grew sharp.

The expert names Luo Xu also had determination burning in his eyes.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang was like him, a Universe God in the First Heaven. As they were both Universe Gods in the First Heaven, he had nothing to be afraid of.

After all, he was the top Universe God in the First Heaven in White Flame Palace. He was a real genius.

“Come on.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. As he stood there, the Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hand.
