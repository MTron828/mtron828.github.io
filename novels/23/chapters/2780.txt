“Jian Yi, Yin Su’er, do you think that you have won? You two have underestimated me.”

Blood Thunder King’s eyes were blood-red, he looked like he had lost his mind. A weird smile crept into the corner of his mouth.

The smile gave an impression like he was a bloodthirsty beast.

“Mr. Chen Kong, come out.”

Blood Thunder King’s voice echoed throughout Bane City and between heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er looked sullen, they had a bad feeling about what was about to happen.

Sure enough, after Blood Thunder King shouted, more than a dozen figures came charging in from the distant void.

All of those more than a dozen figures were dressed in black robes, with an unusually powerful aura. There were a total of twelve of them.

If those twelve people were just ordinary Primary-level and High-level Grand Ultimate Gods, then the combat power of the Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er’s camps would be able to deal with the opponents easily and they need not be bothered. However, those twelve people appeared and turned Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er gloomy.

They appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and others in the blink of an eye, standing next to Blood Thunder King.

The breath of aura was imposing.

Among those twelve people, ten of them had reached the level of High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. The most important thing was that the two leaders who had surpassed the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm. They were Peak Grand Ultimate Gods.

The lineup consisted of two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods and ten High-level Grand Ultimate Gods!

That was jarring even for Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er.

The Grand Ultimate Gods under their command were shocked.

“Who are these people?”

“Ten High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and Peak Grand Ultimate Gods... this lineup?”

“I haven’t seen any of these people. They definitely don’t belong to any of the top forces in Danyang Continent. Where did they come from?”

They stared wide-eyed at the twelve powerful men.

Blood Thunder King appeared together with the old man in a black robe who headed the group of twelve.

“Mr. Chen Kong.” Blood Thunder King had calmed down. Surprisingly, he looked rather humble.

“Blood Thunder King, didn’t you say that as long as you join forces with the Sword Alliance, Yin Su’er is nothing to worry about and we don’t need to anything? You said all we need to do is just clean up the battlefield, no? What’s going on?” The black-robed elder Chen Kong stared at Blood Thunder King, he looked unhappy.

“Mr Chen Kong, I don’t want to be like this either, but I didn’t expect that the Sword Alliance Master would be on Yin Su’er’s side. They have been cooperating for a long time. I was fooled and lost five Grand Ultimate Gods before the fight even began. I have no choice but to let you, Mr Chen Kong get involved in advance,” said Blood Thunder King.

Chen Kong narrowed his eyes slightly, he did not continue blaming Blood Thunder King. Instead, he looked at Jian Wushuang, Yin Su’er and the others.

Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er held Chen Kong’s gaze.

“There are many experts in Danyang Continent and I know most of them. Even if they live a low-key life, I probably have heard of them though I have never seen them. However, I have no idea who these twelve people in front of us are. I’m sure these people are not from Danyang Holy Domain, but from the Outer Realm,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen in a deep voice.

“Experts from the Outer Realm?” Yin Su’er was a little distraught.

“It seems that the Blood Thunder King never really wanted to join hands with me before. What he said to me before was just to clear my doubts and convince me to join hands with him. Fortunately, I am smart. Otherwise, I’d have been tricked.” Jian Wushuang’s glowered.

Blood Thunder King thought that Jian Wushuang was also from the Outer Realm and he had backing from an Undying Saint and a powerful force.

Therefore, Blood Thunder King spoke very sincerely to Jian Wushuang when he first met up with Jian Wushuang to discuss joining hands. Blood Thunder King and even expressed his willingness to surrender to the Undying Saint behind him, even Jian Wushuang felt like believing in him.

It seemed that Blood Thunder King was just lying to Jian Wushuang to trick him into making a move and to be a gunman. After Sword Alliance fought Yin Su’er, Chen Kong and the others would come forward to pick up the deal. As for what the Undying Saint would do thereafter, Blood Thunder King probably was not interested.

There might be an Undying Saint behind Chen Kong’s group as well.

The void above Bane City fell silent and as if the space was stagnated.

The atmosphere is cold and gloomy.

“Who are you?”

Yin Suer’s cold eyes stared down at Chen Kong and the others in front of him.

“Heavenly Modest Palace, Chen Kong,” Chen Kong replied.

“Heavenly Modest Palace?” Yin Suer’s was surprised.

Crimson Stone Fort, was the ruler of Danyang Holy Domain.

As the Crimson Stone Fort Master, apart from maintaining the situation in Crimson Stone Fort, Yin Su’er was also out to deal with powerful forces in other realms and domains.

She was the one who found buyers for Jian Wushuang’s Royal Blood Gem and the Holy Treasure level battle saber.

She knew of some powerful experts in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow, as well as all the big forces.

There was a Heavenly Modest Domain within the Nine Realms of Golden Crow!

The Heavenly Modest Domain was larger than the Danyang Holy Domain and there were more powerful experts. The forces in Heavenly Modest Domain were as messy as Danyang Holy Domain and there were countless forces behind each of them. Nonetheless, the ruler of Heavenly Modest Domain had always been Heavenly Modest Palace!

The Heavenly Modest Domain was dominated by the Heavenly Modest Palace. The Palace Master was a powerful Undying Saint and he was also the Domain Master of the Heavenly Modest Domain. He had a great reputation in the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

Besides Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and Star Picking Pavilion, Heavenly Modest Palace was among the powerful forces in Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

Heavenly Modest Palace left a deep impression on Yin Su’er when she was in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

The Heavenly Modest Domain was very close to Danyang Holy Domain and that was precisely why the Heavenly Modest Palace Master had always been very ambitious.

“Blood Thunder King, you do not have any scruple to collude with the forces from the Outer World just so that you can rule over Crimson Stone Fort?” Yin Su’er’s face was pale, she stared in disbelief at Blood Thunder King.

“Haha, what forces from the Outer Realm? As long as the Heavenly Modest Palace Master is willing, Danyang Holy Domain will become a territory of Heavenly Modest Domain sooner or later. How am I colluding with foreign forces?” Blood Thunder King sneered, “It’s you, you should know how powerful Heavenly Modest Palace is and you should also understand how powerful the Heavenly Modest Palace Master is. Heavenly Modest Palace had been eyeing Danyang Holy Domain for a long time. Do you think you alone can keep Danyang Holy Domain?”

Yin Su’er’s expression became even more morose and at the same time, she felt a huge amount of pressure on her shoulder.
