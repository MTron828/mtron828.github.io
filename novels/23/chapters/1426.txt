Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I have a few treasures. Take a look,” Jian Wushuang took out another Qian Kun ring.

There were merely a few treasures in the Qian Kun ring and they were the most precious few that Jian Wushuang accumulated for all the years. Among them, there were two that he had got from Bei Xiu in Tian Ling Mystery Land.

The elderly in purple robe briefly went through them and replied, “Mister, these few treasures are valued at five million Chaos Gems.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

He had already taken out all his treasures that he had accumulated and he had only kept those that he could use. In the end, he was short of five hundred thousand Chaos Gem.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re so dumb,” King of Venomous Worms suddenly spoke, “Those first-rate bloodline clans’ blood essence are so precious and you owned the royal ancient god’s blood essence which is higher than those first-rate bloodline clan’s blood. Wouldn’t your blood be more valuable than the first-rate bloodline clan’s blood?”

“My blood essence?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and then understood.

He used his willpower and a drop of dark gold blood essence appeared in his palm.

The drop of blood essence was the ancient god blood that he had accumulated for the past few years.

Although he was an Ancient God, it wasn’t easy to accumulate Ancient God blood essence. For the past few years, he had accumulated three drops in total. The three drops could be used at a crucial time.

Then, he took one drop out.

“Look, the drop of blood essence, how much is it worth?” Jian Wushuang passed his Ancient God blood essence over.

The elderly in purple robe took the blood essence and examined carefully. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At first, the elderly in purple robe was calm. Very soon, his facial expression was replaced with an unprecedented terror.

“This… this is Ancient God blood essence?”

“And among the Ancient God clans, the highest bloodline of all, the Royal Ancient God’s blood essence?”

The elderly in the purple robe was astonished and he couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang.

“It is really the Royal Ancient God’s blood essence. Could you see how much is it worth?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The elderly in the purple robe took a deep breath and suppressed the shock in him when he replied, “The drop of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence, the Star Pavilion would normally have the price of fifteen million Chaos Gems.”

“Fifteen million?” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

In order to cultivate Xuan Mie Golden Body, he needed nine types of bloodlines, at a total of twenty-seven drops of blood essence. The value of thirteen million and five hundred thousand Chaos Gem couldn’t even compare to his one single drop of blood essence.

“Mister, the drop of Royal Ancient God blood essence, if you were to sell to Star Pavilion directly, you can get fifteen million Chaos Gem but you could also opt to auction it out on the auction that is taking place three days later. You might be able to get more Chaos Gems then,” the elderly in purple robe replied.

“Auction?” Jian Wushuang was convinced, “Three days later, there will be a huge auction in Star Pavilion?”

“Yes,” the elderly in the purple robe nodded, “Every once in a while, we Star Pavilion hold an auction. There will be a huge number of unique treasures that appear during the auction. At the same time, it will attract many experts. If you were to be interested, you can participate in the auction too. After all, the first-rate bloodline’s blood essence that you requested will require a period of time to gather.”

“As you have explained, I am now interested,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had to wait for those first-rate bloodline clans’ blood essence to arrive at Star Pavilion. He was free anyway, he might as well take a look at the auction.

“Then, put this drop of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence up for auction. Besides, the few treasures that I gave you earlier, if possible, put them up for auction too,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No problem,’ the elderly in the purple robe replied.

Then, Jian Wushuang waited for three days in Star Pavilion.

Three days later, the auction in Star Pavilion started.

The auction in Star Pavilion in Snack Soul City was a huge event and it attracted many experts.

Not only did it include a large number of Universe Gods, but there were even more than twenty Real Gods.

Most of the Real Gods stayed in the independent rooms on the second floor.

In one of the rooms, Jian Wushuang sat in silence.

“Tian Shi, you don’t have to take care of the auction affairs?” Jian Wushuang looked at the elderly in purple robe next to him, Tian Shi.

“No,” Tian Shi shook his head and smiled.

To him, the auction’s affairs were not as important as Jian Wushuang’s.

After all, Jian Wushuang was a disciple of Star Palace and he was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. He was destined to be the higher-ups in Lineage of Star in the future while Tian Shi who was only a Real God outside the region. If he were to be on good terms with Jian Wushuang, it would be a great opportunity.

Looking at Tian Shi refusing, Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows but didn’t push it.

The auction below had started long ago. There were already a hundred over treasures sold.

Among the hundreds of treasures auctioned, there were some of high value and even treasures that would attract Real Gods. However, Jian Wushuang had yet to see any that were useful to him.

“Mister, soon, it will be the Royal Ancient God’s blood essence,” Tian Shi said.

Jian Wushuang looked and he began to look forward to it.

Very soon, someone took the jade bottle up. The lady in red robe who was the host of the auction shouted, “Everyone, the treasure up for auction next’s value could be in the top ten for this auction and, as for its rarity, it is definitely top!”

“The treasure, if you were to miss it, I dare say that you might not have a chance to see it again.”

The lady in the red robe spoke and there was suddenly a commotion at the auction.

The cultivators in the auction, including those Real Gods who had come for the auction, were excited.

The lady in the red robe didn’t blab further but quickly took out the dark gold blood essence from the jade bottle.

The moment the drop of dark gold blood essence revealed itself, the Universe Gods who didn’t know what was going on were calm in the open area. However, the Real Gods in the independent rooms on the second floor were roaring from the bottom of their hearts.

“That is… Ancient God’s blood essence!”

“It is Ancient God’s blood essence, and it is the top clan among Ancient Gods. The highest Royal Ancient God’s blood essence!”

“Oh my, the Royal Ancient God’s blood essence is here in this auction?”

“It’s a pity that the drop of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence power isn’t too strong. If I’m not mistaken, its owner should only be a five-starred Ancient God but yet to pass God’s Test to become a six starred Ancient God. Otherwise, the drop of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence would be really impressive. I reckon many powerful Real Gods would be tempted!”

“Even though it is only the blood essence of a five-starred Royal Ancient God, it is still very rare!”
