Chapter 1202: Brothers Reunited

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

No one could avoid this war, and neither would they want to.

Within just one year, various Dao Masters from different clans in the Green Fire World arrived at Green Fire Palace one after another.

“So many people!”

Floating above Green Fire Palace, Jian Wushuang was shocked when he looked down at the scene inside the palace.

Within the perception range of his Soul, he sensed that there were over 10,000Dao Masters here and even more were on their way.

There were also over 100 Celestial Masters here.

Nearly all the powerful forces within the Green Fire World had gathered here.

“There are so many of them now, but how many would survive the war?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Humph. It’d be fortunate if 10 percent of them even survived the war. If we lose, the whole Green Fire World will be destroyed and everyone here is doomed to die. The lucky survivors will have to go to Eternal Chaotic World,” Gu King replied.

“It’s dangerous there with countless bandits running rampant. If they wander around, it would be hard for even one out of 10 Dao Masters to survive. I estimate that only Celestial Masters would be lucky enough to survive.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression became sober. He clenched his fists and said, “Either way, we cannot lose the war!”

Just then, he spotted several familiar faces in the open space of Green Fire Palace. He immediately flew toward them.

Soon, he landed among the crowd.

“Uncle Xiao and Emperor Yun.”

He looked at the two men in front of him.

“Jian Wushuang.” Emperor Xiao looked at him with a smile.

“Brother Wang Yuan, Second Brother, and Fourth Sister are here too!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with joy when he saw Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou.

“Third Brother!” They greeted Jian Wushuang.

“We’ve gatheredonce again.” Jian Wushuang was once again reunited with his three siblings.

This was their first time gathering since Su Rou’s departure in the Ancient World.

Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Yang Zaixuan met often but Jian Wushuang was the only one to have met Su Rou as she was in the Samsara Continent.

Now that all the experts in the Green Fire World were here, there was no separation between continents and clans. Naturally, they were able to reunite.

“Brother Wang Yuan, why have you come for the war?” Jian Wushuang asked in confusion.

Only experts over the Dao Master level were qualified to participate in the war.

Yang Zaixuan had improved by leaps and bounds to become a Dao Master’s level in a short period of time. Furthermore, thanks to his powerful bloodline, his strength was close to rival Emperor Xiao’s.

Su Rou, Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan, was a formidable opponent. In addition, thanks to her Asura Eye, she commanded control over many experts. She was easily one of the main forces of Green Fire Palace.

Jian Wushuang sensed that Wang Yuan was still in the Eternal Realm, perhaps in the weak first or the second level.

Unfortunately, Eternal Realm experts could bring nothing to the table in this war.

Wang Yuan forced a smile. “I didn’t want to, but my master forced me to come here.”

“Your master?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

Just then, a weathered elder dressed in a grey frock walked toward them at a leisurely pace. He humbly greeted them. “Nice to meet you, Palace Master Wushuang!”

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow. “Alchemy Master.”

This was Alchemy Master Huo Qiong, Wang Yuan’s master. He was also acknowledged as the top alchemist in the Ancient World.

“Palace Master Wushuang, please call me Huo Qiong. I can’t bear the title of Alchemy Master in Green Fire Palace,” Huo Qiong said.

Jian Wushuang blinked and stifled a laugh.

Huo Qiong was renowned as the top alchemist of the Green Fire World but that was as far as his fame extended. There were countless monsters who had lived such long lives in Green Fire Palace. They had all made impressive contributions in refining elixirs, making formations, and forging weapons.

In elixir refinement alone, there were at least five who were more proficient than Huo Qiong.

Huo Qiong was well aware of this fact himself and thus requested to be addressed by name.

“Senior Huo Qiong, Wang Yuan is still in the Eternal Realm. Why did you send him here?” Jian Wushuang asked in astonishment.

“To be honest, I told him to come here not for the war but Dan Xin Palace!” Huo Qiong said.

“Dan Xin Palace?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Dan Xin Palace was the palace born on the battlefield, the one that triggered a ferocious war between Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom.

Huo Qiong was also involved in the birth of Dan Xin Palace.

But no matter how hard everyone struggled, no one could claim Dan Xin Palace. The battle was fought in vain.

In the past few years, both Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom had sent experts with outstanding achievements in elixir refinement to try but no one succeeded.

Just like that, Dan Xin Palace stood in silence on that battlefield.

“Senior Huo Qiong, are you planning to take the test of Dan Xin Palace yourself or send Brother Wang Yuan there?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“There were many stronger alchemists who had failed. I myself know I’m not strong enough for it, but my disciple might be able to do it,” Huo Qiong said.

“Brother Wang Yuan?” Jian Wushuang was even more puzzled.

How could Wang Yuan succeed when Huo Qiong and the other Celestial Masters who were good at refining elixirs had failed?

Jian Wushuang was truly skeptical.

“Jian Wushuang, let him have a go at it. Maybe there’s an opportunity waiting for him,” Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang was even more surprised. “Gu King, do you also think that Wang Yuan will pass the test of Dan Xin Palace?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t know about others but I think that little fatty might stand a chance,” Gu King joked. “This little fatty is pretty interesting, isn’t he?”

“Interesting?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

Gu King snickered. “He refined himself into an elixir. Isn’t he interesting?”

“What? He refined himself into an elixir?” Jian Wushuang was aghast. “What do you mean?”

His face became somber.

Wang Yuan was his brother and one of few that he cared deeply about.

Gu King continued to laugh. “Take it easy. The little fatty will be fine.”
