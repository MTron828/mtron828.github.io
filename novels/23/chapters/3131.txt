Chapter 3132: Exchange

——

“Master Bai Jue asked if you need help. If you need help, he will come forward and guarantee that the Purple Cloud Pavilion won’t dare to touch you,” Jiu Luo said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had just refused the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and Mo Shan, and now Bai Jue came again.

However, Jian Wushuang was also surprised by Dao Palace’s methods.

It was normal for the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to know that he was in trouble because he was in the Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. However, Bai Jue was a member of Dao Palace, so he already knew about it.

The power of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning World was not to be underestimated.

“Jiu Luo, thank Lord Bai Jue for me. Tell him that I thank him for his kindness. As for this trouble, I can handle it myself,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Good, then you are careful,” Jiu Luo said a sentence, then interrupted the transmission.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled. Then he set off for Treasure Pavilion.

Outside the nest of the void, the heart wizard several people have now joined with the dragon egret, in front of them is the brown-haired old man.

“Xin Wu, listen to me. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance will not care about what happened between you and the Heavenly Sword Marquis. However, there is one thing. Do not implicate the other members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In addition, do not make a move in the lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Otherwise…not only you but even your Purple Cloud Pavilion will be finished!” After the brown-haired old man finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Xin Wu, Long Lu, and the others stood there with extremely strange expressions on their faces.

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is actually ignoring this matter?”

“Ignoring it? In other words, they allowed us to seal this space-time?”

“It seems like that’s the case.”

“How is that possible? Since when did the Heaven-cleaving Alliance become so easy to talk to?”

Long Lu and the others were very confused, especially long Lu.

He had thought that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would definitely be furious and might directly teach them a lesson or even kill them. Even if they did not do anything, they would definitely ask them to remove the space-time blockade around them.

But in the end…the Heaven-cleaving Alliance did not do that. Instead, they let them be and completely ignored this matter.

“It’s a little strange, but the Heaven-cleaving Alliance doesn’t care about this matter. This is a good thing for us,” the bald old man, Xin Wu, who was wearing a black robe with a round collar, said in a cold voice.

“Elder Xin Wu, although the Heaven-cleaving Alliance doesn’t intend to interfere in this matter, they also warned us not to make a move in the nest. If that’s the case if Heavenly Sword Marquis hides in the nest all the time, won’t we be unable to do anything to him?” Long Lu said with a frown.

“That’s indeed the case.” Xin Wu nodded. “However, according to what you said, Heavenly Sword Marquis is only a rank three True Saint, yet he was able to kill my disciple head-on. His talent is bound to be shocking. If such a super genius is trapped here by us all the time, then it will be very difficult for him to truly display his talent. This is definitely not what he wants, so he will definitely think of a way to come out from inside.”

“We don’t have to worry. As long as the Heaven-cleaving Alliance doesn’t chase us away, we’ll wait outside the Mystic Realm.”

Xin Wu’s eyes were cold, and his heart was filled with shocking killing intent.

Chu Yixiao was his disciple, and he was the favorite among his disciples. Now that Chu Yixiao was killed by Jian Wushuang, he would definitely find ways to avenge Chu Yixiao. Even if he had to stay outside the nest for thousands of years, he would never give up.

The heart witch had already made up her mind and was waiting outside the realm.

In the Mystic Realm, Jian Wushuang had already arrived at the Treasure Pavilion.

“Lord Tiansuo.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the golden light in front of him and immediately bowed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What do you need?” Lord Tiansuo’s expression was still cold.

“I want to exchange for one universe crystal.” Jian Wushuang directly took out a universe crystal.

Xue Bei gave him a total of ten universe crystals. He had used one to exchange for the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, but now Jian Wushuang was here to exchange for the second one.

“As before, one universe crystal is worth 7.5 billion holy elixirs,” Lord Tiansuo said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He had exchanged 7.5 billion holy elixirs for universe crystals. Over the years, Jian Wushuang had killed many experts and collected many resources and treasures.

In this mission, he had killed nearly 30 True Saint experts, including divine level four, and then more than a dozen experts, including Chu Yixiao, during the Great War. Many of these experts were powerful and had a lot of wealth, it should be about 4 billion holy elixirs.

7.5 billion and 4 billion, that was 11.5 billion!

With such a huge amount of holy elixirs, Jian Wushuang naturally had to exchange for the treasures he needed in the Treasure Pavilion.

An hour passed in the blink of an eye.

During this hour, Jian Wushuang had used up all of the 11.5 billion holy elixirs.

He first exchanged for a special secret manual called ‘nine serenities reincarnation strategy’, which was worth 4 billion holy elixirs!

‘Nine serenities reincarnation strategy’ was similar to ‘Gold-splitting Secret Manual’ in nature. The Gold-splitting Secret Manual was left behind by a powerful Principles Master, which perfectly dissected the space-time principles, it was very useful for Jian Wushuang to comprehend the space-time principles.

‘Nine serenities reincarnation strategy’ was also left behind by the Principles Master, which also dissected the principles. However, ‘nine serenities reincarnation strategy’ dissected the reincarnation principles.

There were only two parts of the ‘nine serenities reincarnation strategy’. Jian Wushuang had exchanged for the upper part and spent a total of four billion holy elixirs.

Although these four billion holy elixirs were extremely valuable, Jian Wushuang knew that the ‘nine serenities reincarnation strategy’ would definitely be of great help to him in comprehending samsara rules, it would not be less valuable than the comprehension of time and space from the ‘Gold-splitting secret manual’.

Subsequently, Jian Wushuang spent a total of three billion holy elixirs to exchange for the sword principle trial tower of the black grade!

Jian Wushuang had experienced the sword principle trial tower before.

In his previous life, he had met a super expert in sword principle, Di Shisan. Di Shisan had thought of a way to let him cultivate in the sword principle trial tower for a thousand years. During that thousand years, Jian Wushuang had opened a new door to the sword principle.

The reason why he was able to improve his sword principle so quickly was definitely related to the thousand years.

In this life, especially now that he had stepped into the First Heaven, he knew that the sword principle trial tower that Di Shisan had given him before was only the lowest level. It was specially prepared for some people who had just entered the sword principle.

The black grade sword principle trial tower that Jian Wushuang had exchanged for was specially prepared for some powerful Immortal Saints. As long as they were good at sword principle, they could use it from a rank one True Saint to a rank seven True Saint.

Jian Wushuang could also use this sword principle trial tower to improve his understanding of sword principle and to hone his swordsmanship.
