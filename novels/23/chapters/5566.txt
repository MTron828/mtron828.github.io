“Haha, never did I imagine that one day I would become the leader, even the one to lead the downfall of the Qishen Temple!” Zhuang Zhong chuckled maniacally.

His strength, in ancient times, was that of a mere insignificant figure. Though he had reached the Tribulation realm, he was nothing more than an ant compared to figures like the Qishen.

To catch the eye of Qishen, one needed to at least grasp the Tribulation of the universe.

He was just a desolate beast newly entered into the Tribulation realm, and his family’s influence was quite ordinary. His ancestor was only a Second Tribulation expert, holding some sway in the Three Kings Court, but in the eyes of the Qishen, he amounted to nothing.

Now, being able to lead the decline of the Qishen Temple, how could this not drive him mad?

“Qishen?” Zhuang Zhong gritted his teeth.

When the Three Kings fell, a Divine Master from the Qishen Temple descended, suppressing them all and plundering them into the Qishen Temple.

This grudge, he had never forgotten.

Zhen Ling sensed the rising hostility in the opponent’s aura, and his heart sank.

It seemed that this plan was going to end in a big failure.

Shen Ling Frolasa, however, was ecstatic in his heart. As long as he killed the true body of Zhen Ling, everything would be manageable.

He simply didn’t believe that Zhen Ling would dare to summon his true self.

If he really did summon his true self, he would accept it. At worst, they would be trapped together in this place.

He bet that Zhen Ling wouldn’t dare to do so.

The Inheritors had just risen, and Zhen Ling wouldn’t give up.

No one from the outside had been able to shoulder the great responsibility of the Qishen Temple. Once Zhen Ling was trapped here, the Qishen Temple would face external threats and internal rebellion.

The True Master of the Original Universe, he was aware of it, and the other party was using his power to break the seal. The strength of that True Master was not weak.

In the beginning, the Devouring Dao created three True Masters. One of them, however, had his Origin Source shattered in a battle, giving rise to five Demon Lords—Shan Jun of the Demon Sound Mountain, the ‘Ten Thousand Demons’ of the Xuanwu Temple, and the Blood Demon at the side of Lord Yun Zhong.

The remaining two were the Wind Demon, controlled by a Zhen Ling, and the Heart Demon, whose whereabouts were unknown.

Each possessed the strength of a Half-Step Tribulation realm.

Despite splitting into five entities, they all retained formidable power. The strength of the True Master was truly terrifying. During the peak of the Original Universe’s suppression, that True Master wielded the power of the Fifth Tribulation realm.

However, after being injured by someone and subsequently suppressed, he now possessed the strength of only Third Tribulation realm. Even so, this level of power posed a threat to the Qishen Temple.

If Zhen Ling were in control, it would be manageable. However, without Zhen Ling’s presence and relying solely on the external defenses of the Qishen Temple, it would likely be challenging to withstand the True Master’s assault.

Therefore, Zhen Ling dared not gamble; he did not dare to allow his true body to enter this place.

Yet, without the true body present, the current avatar alone could not stop the impending threat.

When Fuego regained his peak strength, there might be a way to escape from this place. Otherwise, Frolasa wouldn’t dare let Fuego recklessly enter.

“You fool!” Zhen Ling angrily shouted, glaring at Zhuang Zhong. “Who do you think yo uare? Today, I’ll eliminate you first!”

Buzz!

Without further ado, Zhen Ling made his move.

A black brilliance emanated from his body as the might of the Universe Treasures erupted. From the battle armor on his body to the immensely powerful Four-Faced Light Realm in his hand, all radiated dazzling brilliance.

However, this brilliance differed from the white sunlight—it was a black light.

Zhen Ling attacked directly, hitting Frolasa where it hurt the most!

Zhuang Zhong roared angrily, his body swelling to obscure the sky, transforming into a desolate beast.

“Black Radiant Realm, Light Lake!”

Faced with such a powerful treasure, Zhuang Zhong did not retreat. Just as he had said, he was now in control of everything.

A punch went straight ahead, a buzzing sound from ancient times echoing. The desolate beast, dwelling in darkness, clashed with Zhen Ling in a fierce battle.

The onlookers were boiling with excitement.

This was a Tribulation realm powerhouse!

Jian Wushuang was equally shaken. Although Shen Ling dismissed the Tribulation realm as worthless, the aura emanating from the opponent made him yearn for it.

As a Dao Lord, in such a battle, he might not survive a single breath; a casual wave of energy could shatter him.

“Go, kill them!” Zhen Ling pointed towards the people in the distant formation, saying to the Special Life Forms behind him, “Leave none alive!”

The Special Life Form experts couldn’t wait any longer. Upon hearing the command from Zhen Ling, they immediately moved.

Several dozen Special Life Forms with peak strength made the Shen Ling Frolasa frown.

If they were ordinary supreme-peak experts, it would be acceptable, but among them were Special Life Form comparable to Half-Step Tribulation realm, making the situation troublesome.

“The rest, protect Jian Wushuang. Leave these people to me!” Fuego stepped forward at this moment.

Now, things were getting complicated.

He had to deal with these Special Life Forms first.

Shen Ling alone couldn’t handle it.

Boom!

The Special Life Form at the forefront had a 80,000-fold divine body. Before entering this place, Zhen Ling had bestowed many treasures upon them, causing their strength to skyrocket.

An 80,000-fold divine body was already the limit for an Emperor.

Even crossing into the Tribulation realm, it was difficult for the divine body to reach 80,000-fold.

The opponent was a Special Life Form, born with a perfect divine body.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Similar to Chishui, even at his weakest, he possessed a 10,000-fold divine body.

Now, having grown to this extent, it was quite normal. However, for cultivators to reach an 80,000-fold divine body, it was a bit challenging.

Even for a special divine body, it was difficult to achieve.

Boom!

A massive palm imprint descended, and Shen Ling transformed into a golden dragon, roaring into the sky.

The most powerful among those Special Life Forms engaged in a fierce battle with Shen Ling Frolasa.

“Tsk tsk, enjoyable! Not bad for a Tribulation realm expert!”

The other Special Life Forms watched with envy, but none joined the fray. Instead, they charged towards Fuego.

Among these Special Life Forms, the first three unleashed their power, revealing 78,000-fold divine bodies.

“We’ll handle this one; the rest of you, break the formation!”

Although these bloodthirsty and combative Special Life Forms weren’t particularly bright, they weren’t fools either.

They understood the situation.

Before entering this place, Zhen Ling had already given instructions: only one person would have the authority on the battlefield, and everyone had to follow their commands.

“Yes!!!”

Among the remaining dozens of Special Life Forms, the weakest had divine bodies exceeding 60,000-fold, while one had a 74,000-fold divine body.

Facing these special existences, those standing within the formation felt a sense of hopelessness.

“No!” The elder of the Moluo Nation, draped in a black robe, was in despair. The robe fluttered as an overwhelming aura erupted.

Jian Wushuang quickly retreated. Although this formation converted Life power, it still had some defensive capabilities.

For the moment, the Special Life Forms couldn’t break through it.

“What do we do?” Jian Wushuang felt anxious.

This situation was beyond his capabilities; there was simply no solution.

Using force directly was absolutely not an option!

Jian Wushuang stared at the three-sided battlefield, realizing that it might soon become a four-sided conflict.

The battle between Zhen Ling and Zhuang Zhong was the most intense, both being complete Tribulation realm experts, emitting the most captivating auras.

Next was the battle that Shen Ling and Fuego were fighting together.

They originally thought that by teaming up, they could stop all the Special Life Forms. However, they found that the three strongest among them were evenly matched with Shen Ling.
