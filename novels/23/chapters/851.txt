Chapter 852: The Dragon-phoenix Fruit

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A Divine Realm expert?”

Commander Hong and the other guards all looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Mountain, he is a Divine Realm expert?”

“How is this possible?”

The four people, including Commander Hong, were a bit dumbfounded.

Jian Wushuang was a Divine Realm expert?

A Divine Realm expert became a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard?

A Divine Realm expert was able to complete a Catastrophe Level task alone?

A Divine Realm expert was able to easily defeat Zi Diao?

How could such a Divine Realm expert exist in the world?

Under everyone’s gaze, Jian Wushuang had a wry smile.

He was only a Divine Realm expert, but he had used the Yin-Yang Mirror to hide his aura.

The Yin-Yang Mirror was indeed extraordinary. Ordinary Dao Masters were unable to see through him. Even Commander Hong had not discovered the truth.

However, Empress Leng, one of the four emperors of the Tang of the East, was a supreme Dao Master.

Faced with such a super expert, The Yin-Yang Mirror was useless.

Jian Wushuang had no intention to defend himself, and said directly, “Empress Leng, I am indeed a Divine Realm expert, but I am also a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard.”

“Oh?” Empress Leng looked at Commander Hong.

“Empress Leng, Blood Mountain indeed relied on his own ability to complete all kinds of difficult tasks and become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. He also beat another Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, so his strength is good,” Commander Hong said.

“Since his strength is fine, then forget it, but it is rare that a Divine Realm expert can become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard,” Empress Leng said in a flat toneless voice.

But Jiu Zui, Ling Long, and Shui Jin were rocked to their core.

They had also seen a lot of Divine Realm experts.

The powerful Divine Realm experts they have met in the Eternal World usually had Step Four battle strength. Even Xia Yan, the number one Divine Realm expert, barely possessed Step Five battle strength.

Nevertheless, there was a huge gap between Xia Yan and Jian Wushuang.

They never imagined that a Divine Realm expert would have battle strength at the Peak of Step Six.

This had never happened in the history of the Eternal World.

Jian Wushang was absolutely the strongest Divine Realm expert!

“Well, let’s get back to business.”

Empress Leng looked down. “I requested for you this time because of a special task. As for the contents of the task, wait here a moment and someone will explain it to you.”

Jian Wushuang was waiting quietly in the hall with his fellow guards who threw a quick glance at him from time to time.

Not long after, a figure stepped in.

It was a big fat man in a luxurious robe who wore a variety of gems. His face was just as large as a watermelon.

The fatty went straight to the steps and respectfully bowed. “I pay my respects to Empress Leng.”

“Rise.” Empress Leng waved her hand.

The fatty could not help but look at the people standing next to him.

Jian Wushuang also glanced at the fatty.

They were both shocked.

Both of them were ecstatic.

“Haha, Third Brother!” The fatty directly let out a hearty laugh.

“Big Brother Wang Yuan.” Jian Wushuang was also pleasantly surprised.

Yes, this fatty was Jian Wushuang’s sworn brother, Wang Yuan!

In this world, Jian Wushuang had few valued friends, but his three sworn brothers were an exception.

Jian Wushuang had met Yang Zaixuan on Cercis Island.

Now, in this palace of the Tang of the East, he had encountered Wang Yuan! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“How, do you know each other?” A cold voice, containing endless majesty, echoed throughout the palace.

Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan immediately realized they had over-reacted and started to reign in their ecstasy.

Wang Yuan replied, “Empress Leng, this is my good brother from the Ancient World.”

“He left the Ancient World alone many years ago and I haven’t seen him since. Meeting each other again like this was a surprise. I forgot myself, so I’m sorry. I hope you won’t blame me.”

“No problem.” Empress Leng waved her hand. “You can tell them about this mission now.”

“OK.”

Wang Yuan nodded, then turned to tell them the details. But at this moment, his brow was locked and his look was somewhat complicated.

He did not expect that Jian Wushuang would get involved in this matter.

This mission was so dangerous that death was almost guaranteed.

Wang Yuan spoke. “This mission is related to the princess!

“The princess’s constitution is very unique. Because of this, she has been tortured by a deadly poison for a long time. Nothing can detoxify her body, but her current condition has deteriorated to a new level.

“So the princess needs an elixir to stabilize her condition, but this elixir is at an extremely high-level that is beyond your imagination. Throughout the Eternal World, there are less than three people who are able to refine this elixir.

“Even the materials for refining this elixir are rare.

“We can get all of them, except one of the most precious and important materials, the Dragon-phoenix Fruit!”

“Dragon-phoenix Fruit?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

He had never heard of it.

However, even the Tang of the East was unable to obtain this Dragon-phoenix Fruit, which meant that this fruit was really rare and precious.

“This Dragon-phoenix Fruit has almost disappeared in the Eternal World. Many years ago, the Tang of the East sent people to secretly search for it, but no news about it was discovered. Until recently that is. We’ve heard that a long time ago, an Eternal Realm expert called Kong Ming received a Dragon-phoenix Fruit by chance.

“We found out that Kong Ming was hunted 50,000 years ago and he fled into Stellar Fog Sea. But, after that, there was no trace.

“Your mission is to go to Stellar Fog Sea, find Kong Ming, and get the Dragon-phoenix Fruit from him.”
