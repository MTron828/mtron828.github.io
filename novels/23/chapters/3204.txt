Chapter 3205: The Bloody Sword Skill

——

“The combination of the shadowless escape skill and the bloody sword skill created the widely recognized number one assassin of that era, the master of the bloody sword. However, I have only mastered the shadowless escape skill…” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Previously, in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range, he had used the shadowless escape skill and the silent sword skill he had comprehended to kill the 13 axes.

The reason was that the 13 axes were too weak. If it had been another expert, such as Jian Wushuang, who had used the shadowless escape art to perform the silent swordsmanship when he was fighting Duan Lang, the 13 axes would have been killed, however, Duan Lang had reacted at the last moment and avoided his vital points in time. The swordsmanship could not pierce through Duan Lang’s protective armor when it pierced his divine body.

In other words, even if Duan Lang did not have the Black Demon Realm and could not sense his presence, he could at least last for a long time in his hands.

However, if the silent sword skill was replaced with the Blood Blade sword skill…

“The silent sword skill was left behind by the sword origin master. In terms of strength, although the sword origin master is also a Principles Master, he is far inferior to the Blood Blade Master. Moreover, the silent sword skill is not the strongest sword skill of the sword origin master. It was just casually left behind by the sword origin master. In comparison, the Blood Blade sword skill is naturally much stronger than the silent sword skill,” Jian Wushuang thought.

There were still more than eight years before the opening of the Blood Wave Realm. During these eight years, Jian Wushuang had been thinking of mastering the Blood Blade sword art.

Once he mastered it, with the Blood Blade sword art and the shadowless escape art, his assassination ability would be truly terrifying. At that time, not to mention a Peak Saint, even an Invincible Saint could be killed if he was not careful.

“I’ve been comprehending the blood sword skill for a while. There are four sword skills in total, each of which is extremely exquisite and complicated!”

“I only have eight years. It’s impossible for me to master all four sword skills of the blood sword skill. I can only focus all my energy on the first move of the blood sword skill. If I can master the first move in these eight years, it’ll be a great achievement!” Jian Wushuang already had his own plan in his heart.

Immediately, he began to carefully study the image left by the Blood Blade Master under the iceberg. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the image, the Blood Blade Master performed a total of four sword techniques,

the first move was called ‘dripping blood’.

…

Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, more than eight years had passed.

In the True Martial Mystic Realm, Jian Wushuang was still sitting cross-legged under the iceberg with a slight frown on his face.

“Blood drop, sword rise, blood drop!”

“This sword move condenses all the power into one point, and then suddenly explodes and penetrates the opponent’s divine body. Not only in terms of swordsmanship speed but also in terms of power, it is much stronger than the breath-free swordsmanship, especially the terrifying penetrating power!”

Jian Wushuang slightly clenched his hands.

The most terrifying part of the blood drop move of the bloody blade sword technique was the penetrating power.

It condensed all the power into the tip of the sword and then exploded, breaking through all the obstacles in front of it in an instant.

“This blood drop move is extremely exquisite. Over the past eight years, I have spent all my energy on this sword move. Although I have comprehended most of the mysteries of this sword move and can barely perform this sword move, what I can perform is only a framework, but I can’t perform the true power of this sword move!

“I always feel that something is missing. If I’m not wrong, what I lack is the penetrating power!”

“The penetrating power contained in the first move of blood drop doesn’t seem to be as simple as it seems.”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had already realized that he was missing something when he was comprehending the first move of blood drop, and he already knew what he was missing.

If he was given more time to comprehend the sword skill under the iceberg, he would be able to completely comprehend it in three to five years at most.

Unfortunately, he did not have that much time, because the Blood Wave Realm was about to open.

“It’s too late. Temple Master Bai Xing has sent me a message to gather at the drill ground.” Jian Wushuang looked up at the iceberg in front of him, feeling a little regretful.

His original plan was to master the blood drop one move before he went to the Blood Wave Realm, but now it seemed that he could not achieve it.

He could only go to the Blood Wave Realm first and study it slowly when he got there.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang stood up and looked at iceberg longingly. Then he went straight to the drill ground.

On the drill ground where Jian Wushuang had fought with Duan Lang, several figures had gathered.

Jian Wushuang flew over from afar and landed in front of these figures.

As soon as he arrived, Jian Wushuang bowed to the black-clothed elder in front of him and said, “Greetings, Lord Hunyuan.”

“Yes.” The black-clothed elder, master of Hunyuan, nodded slightly. “Temple Master Bai Xing has instructed me to lead you to the Blood Wave Realm. Among the six of you, Heavenly Sword Marquis has just arrived at my Temporal Temple. Previously, he had only met Duan Lang, Qian Hongzi, and Feixue, but I’m afraid that the other two haven’t met yet. Now, you can get to know each other first.”

As soon as Hunyuan Master finished speaking, a burly man in red armor walked out and stood in front of Jian Wushuang. He stared at Jian Wushuang with his slightly bloodshot eyes and then grinned, revealing his white teeth, he said, “You’re Heavenly Sword Heavenly? I heard that you were able to severely injure Duan Lang after he used the Black Demon Realm. He didn’t even have the confidence to defeat you. You’re quite powerful.”

“You’re…Yue Yu?” Jian Wushuang looked at the burly man in front of him.

He had heard from Qian Hongzi and the others that Yue Yu was simple and honest. He looked a bit silly, which was obviously a perfect match for the man in front of him.

“It’s me.” Yue Yu nodded. “I had been training outside and came back six months ago. When I came back, I heard about the battle between you and Duan Lang. Then I couldn’t help but fight with Duan Lang. I have to say that Duan Lang has cultivated the Black Demon secret skill to the profound realm, so his strength is indeed very strong. I can’t even gain any advantage from fighting with him.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He had fought with Duan Lang before, so he knew that Duan Lang’s battle strength was almost comparable to that of the Invincible Saint.

However, Yue Yu was comparable to Duan Lang, which showed his strength.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, ignore him. This guy is a battle maniac. If you talk to him, he will challenge you again.”

Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, and Feixue also walked up.
