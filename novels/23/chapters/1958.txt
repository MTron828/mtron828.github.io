The moment Jian Wushuang’s command was sent down, the surrounding higher ups of Green Fire World looked shocked.

Green Fire World was prospering and the surrounding ancient battlefield was a great training ground.

At such a crucial moment, Jian Wushuang had suddenly sent down a command to prohibit everyone from entering ancient battlefield. The reason behind it...

“Unless?” Jian Nantian’s gaze froze as he figured one possibility.

“You guessed it right. The experts from Eternal Chaotic World has already descended!!!” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Everyone looked terrified when they heard that.

...

In the vast ancient battlefield, there were boundless opportunities.

Right at the space gap, where it connected to ancient mystery land:

Vroom!

There was a sudden flash of light in the hidden space gap. Then, there were three shadows that leaped out.

The three of them were Almighties and they came of the same force.

The three of them looked around after it appeared.

“This is the brand new ancient battlefield?”

“It seems that we should be the earliest to reach here.”

As the three of them were chatting, the space gap behind them had another flash of light again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were a few figures that leapt out of the space gap one after another.

“They are from Divine King Island. The one leading is Number One Divine King.”

The three of them immediately recognized the incomer.

However, it was merely the beginning. There were continuous figures that constantly leapt out from the space gap.

After a short while, there were already dozens of people who had arrived at the ancient battlefield. They were merely the first batch of experts to arrive in the ancient battlefield.

After them, there were many people who swarmed in.

The experts who came to the ancient battlefield felt the unusual environment on the ancient battlefield at the first instant.

The spiritual influence of heaven and earth is so intense!”

“It’s too intense. It’s more intense than Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries by a dozen times. How could it be so intense?”

“They are both ancient battlefield but the spiritual influence of heaven and earth in the ancient battlefield in ancient mystery land and here are so far apart.”

“With such intense spiritual influence of heaven and earth, how amazing would it be to cultivate on the ancient battlefield?”

The other experts complimented, then...

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s look for an opportunity!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The first batch of experts didn’t wait any longer but immediately dispersed to look for opportunities.

Then, the second batch, the third batch and many other experts descended. They wandered in the ancient battlefield and started their search.

All experts descended!

The ancient battlefield, that had been silent for God knows how many years, finally became bustling.

There’s no doubt that the ancient battlefield was covered with opportunity and treasure. Previously, no one had searched for them.

Previously, Green Fire World had been too weak and they didn’t even have one Universe God. Hence, even though they were in the ancient battlefield for so many years, they were not capable enough to obtain the opportunities in the ancient battlefield.

Then, Jian Wushuang had suddenly risen and searched for a while. However, he was alone after all.

With his effort alone, even if he was given tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, he wouldn’t be able to search through too much of an area. Similarly, he wouldn’t be able to find too many opportunities.

But then, all experts had descended. All Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World were going to search and wander in the ancient battlefield altogether. The probability of finding an opportunity would naturally be far bigger.

As they searched, the opportunities would be unearthed one by one.

As the experts descended on the battlefield, the cave dwelling left behind by an expert in ancient times were found in one month.

The cave dwelling left by an expert in ancient times, if it were to be in ancient mystery land, they might not even find one in hundreds of thousands of years.

However, on the brand new ancient battlefield, it only took one month for the first cave dwelling left by an expert in ancient times to come to light.

The cave dwelling was filled with opportunities that many Sir Gods and Emperor Gods would be crazy about. In such a situation, there was naturally a fight.

During the fight, there were experts who passed away.

Besides, whatever that happened in the ancient battlefield naturally spread to Eternal Chaotic World.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were many forces, sects and solo experts who had received news of the birth of the brand new ancient battlefield earlier. However, just in case, many forces had only sent a few experts to explore and check on the situation.

For instance, Soaring Heaven King Palace had only sent Emperor God Tian Ling alone.

But then, after a month’s time, there was news about another discovery from the ancient battlefield. It was obvious that the ancient battlefield contained great opportunities.

Hence, the experts who had held back previously and those experts who had been contemplating previously, they didn’t hesitate anymore and swarmed into the ancient battlefield.

Even the old folks who cultivated in seclusion all year round slowly revealed themselves and rushed to the ancient battlefield.

After a few years’ time, there were more than a hundred Almighties who rushed to the ancient battlefield. In addition to experts from the special tribes, there were almost a thousand of them!

It could be said that more than half of the Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World had arrived at the battlefield.

It was a feast!

An unprecedented feast.

As the Almighties searched madly, the time flew past.

In the blink of an eye, ninety years had passed.

Ninety years were nothing to many Almighties.

If in ancient mystery land, unless one was extremely lucky, otherwise, ninety years of exploration would come to nothing.

However, on the brand new battlefield, there were boundless opportunities in a short ninety years span.

Forget about the others, in terms of cave swelling left behind by experts in ancient times, there were four in the ninety years span!!!

In the four cave dwellings, they contained boundless opportunities.

However, the threshold to receive the opportunities were extremely high.

The Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World wandered for ninety years on ancient battlefield and gained more or less.

Some who were lucky gained a bountiful harvest that made people green with envy.

But even so, the places that the experts searched through were merely a small part of the entire ancient battlefield.

In the void above the ancient battlefield, there were two Sir Gods flying side by side and they spread their Soul Power.

But just then...

“Huh?”

The two Sir Gods were surprised. They sensed a huge object in front of them with their Soul Power.

“What’s that?”

“Judging from the looks of it, it seems to be a big world!”

The two Sir Gods exchanged a look and they looked astonished.

The space gap that connected ancient mystery land wasn’t too far away from Green Fire World. Emperor God Xie Xin had only came across Green Fire World after twelve thousand years. Then, it had only been ninety years since the experts descended, but there were too many experts who were wandering in the battlefield. Hence, the probability of them finding Green Fire World was naturally much greater.
