Chapter 1463: Invitation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the void filled with pungent blood scent, Jian Wushuang appeared on the peak of a mountain. He was overlooking a vast territory before him. The territory was made of billowing hills that formed into a huge mountain range.

“Here, this should be Darkness Mountain.”

“Darkness Mountain is said to be the territory of one of the four Kings, Blood Emperor. In Darkness Mountain, there are many experts. There should be some experts on the second level too. I wonder when I’ll meet them.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and then he entered Darkness Mountain to wander around.

Sky Sword Prison wasn’t that big. It was at most the size of an ordinary realm in the outside world. As the overlord of the prison, the four Kings had their territories each in Sky Sword Prison and they had many experts under their command.

The Darkness Mountain was the territory of one of the four Kings, Blood Emperor.

Jian Wushuang was there to have a chance to fight against experts on the second level.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang came across a Real God in Darkness Mountain and they started fighting.

In the continuous hills, there was a pinnacle that seemed to be tainted with fresh blood.

On the peak of the pinnacle, there was a crimson castle.

The crimson castle was where the Blood Emperor resided.

In a private room, there was a person in a crimson, long robe. He had crimson, long hair and even his skin was dimly red. He looked just like an elderly with blade-like eyebrows who was showering in crimson sea.

The elderly with blade-like eyebrows was Blood Emperor!

One of the top experts in Sky Sword Prison.

Blood Emperor meditated in seclusion in the secret room all year round. He hardly revealed himself.

But then, Blood Emperor’s eyes suddenly shot open.

“Such senses…”

“Who? Who is it?”

“Who came to Darkness Mountain?”

As Blood Emperor muttered, in the depth of his crimson red eyes, there was light shimmering. His body quivered slightly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, Blood Emperor’s figure became vague and suddenly appeared in the middle of the hall in the crimson castle.

“Master!”

A lady in green stood before Blood Emperor politely.

“Zi Shuang, while I meditated in seclusion, did anything major happen in Sky Sword Prison?” Blood Emperor asked coldly.

“All these years, Sky Sword Prison has been the same as before. Nothing major happened,” the lady in green answered.

“How about the newcomers? I’ve been meditating in seclusion for fifty thousand years. There should be many newcomers imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, right?” Blood Emperor asked.

“During the fifty thousand years when master was meditating in seclusion, from what I know, there’s been a total of three hundred and eighty-five newcomers. Ninety percent of these newcomers are dead and only a portion of them survived in Sky Sword Prison,” the lady in green reported.

“Among the newcomers, is there anyone who is wandering in Darkness Mountain?” Blood Emperor continued to ask.

“There’s one,” the lady in green nodded, “His name is Jian Wushuang, he’s a Universe God. He’s in Sky Sword Prison for a thousand and three hundred over years. During his time here, he has fought with many experts in Sky Sword Prison and he has improved tremendously. A few days ago, he came to Darkness Mountain and fought with a Real God under your command in Darkness Mountain.”

“However, as Jian Wushuang fought with the Real God in order to train his swordsmanship but didn’t kill anyone, I let him continue to wander in Darkness Mountain as he wished.”

“As expected, there is a newcomer in Darkness Mountain, Jian Wushuang…” Blood Emperor smiled and sighed. He then commanded, “Send a message to the Real Gods, Universe Gods in Darkness Mountain. If they see Jian Wushuang, tell them to send a message on my behalf. Tell him that I, Blood Emperor, would like to invite him to pay a visit at the castle.”

“Yes,” the lady in green nodded and quickly carried out her task.

The entire hall only had Blood Emperor left.

Then, Blood Emperor squinted his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang…”

“I wonder if he’s from my tribe. If he is, I’ll let him off. But if he isn’t…”

A sharp, shrill shot out from Blood Emperor’s eyes.

In Darkness Mountain.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A loud thud was heard across the sky.

A brawny man in black armor and a black triangle helmet and holding a black long spear had a soaring rage. He continuously stabbed with his long spear and every single stab was like a raging flood dragon. It pierced through the void and aimed at Jian Wushuang’s head.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang became three shadows and flickered in the void at high speed. He dodged the hit of the brawny man easily, then he swung out Blood Mountain Sword at lightning speed too.

Every sword light was extremely eye-catching.

In terms of power, both of them were obviously not much different. They had been fighting ferociously for an hour in the void but the match was too close to call.

Finally, the two of them calmed down.

“In Sky Sword Prison, there are only two Universe Gods who are qualified to be on the second level. They are imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison long ago and they experienced countless massacres and training to be where they are today. Then, there’s another Universe God standing on the second level!”

“Jian Wushuang, you’ve only been in Sky Sword Prison for one thousand and three hundred years and you reached the standard of the second level. That’s rather impressive!”

“If you were to continue to improve at such speed, I’m afraid that there might be a chance for us to give birth to the fifth King in Sky Sword Prison in no time.”

The brawny man in black armor spoke in a loud and bright voice. It reverberated in the universe.

“The fifth King?” Jian Wushuang chuckled, “Real God Hei Xiu must be joking. That I could improve to where I am now as a Universe God is already lucky enough. To become the fifth King… there might be a slight possibility after I break through and become Real God.”

The brawny man, Real God Hei Xiu, raised his eyebrows but didn’t deny it.

“Jian Wushuang, I have just received a piece of news from the owner of Darkness Mountain, Blood Emperor.” Real God Hei Xiu said, “Blood Emperor want us to pass you a message on his behalf if we see you. He would like to invite you to his crimson castle.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

One of the four Kings, Blood Emperor, had invited him over?

“Real God Hei Xiu, do you know what is Blood Emperor looking for me for?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know,” Real God Hei Xiu shook his head, “I’m only responsible for passing the message on. As for Real God Hei Xiu’s purpose, I’m not sure. It’s up to you whether you go to the crimson castle.”

Real God Hei Xiu said and disappeared before Jian Wushuang in the next moment.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void in confusion.

“I have never come across Blood Emperor at all. Why would he invite me over out of nowhere?”
