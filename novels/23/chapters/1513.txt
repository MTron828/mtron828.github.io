Chapter 1514: Huge Movement

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

For the birth of a White Blaze Fruit for the first three times, Jian Wushuang was too far away and he couldn’t rush there in time.

However, the fourth time… Jian Wushuang managed to get there in time.

There were three White Blaze Fruits that came to the world at the same time. When Jian Wushuang appeared at the birthplace, there was already a mad fight going on.

There was a total of a hundred Universe Gods that participated in the fifth battle. Out of the three White Blaze Fruits, two were taken away. The remaining one fell into the hands of a Universe God. Jian Wushuang knew the Universe God too. His name was Universe God Tie Cang. Universe God Tie Cang was in the twenty-eighth place on Universe God ranking list. He was considered one of the top experts. Even when he came across an ordinary Real God, he could fight head-on.

But then, Universe God Tie Cang was besieged by almost a hundred Universe Gods. If it wasn’t for him being extremely strong in defense, he would have been killed long ago.

Jian Wushuang immediately got involved and cast eighteen shadows simultaneously. Under the effect of Power of Spacetime, he went through the crowd and appeared before Universe God Tie Cang.

“Universe God Tie Cang, pass me the White Blaze Fruit. Otherwise, die!” Jian Wushuang’s bellow traveled into Universe God Tie Cang’s ears.

“You are… Jian Wushuang?” Universe God Tie Cang almost recognized Jian Wushuang. Even though he was unwilling to, he took out the White Blaze Fruit and threw it at Jian Wushuang.

He was certain that Jian Wushuang would never come and he could only opt to give up the White Blaze Fruit under the siege of almost a hundred Universe Gods.

As Jian Wushuang came, he decided to just give a favor at a little cost.

Jian Wushuang extended his hand and took the White Blaze Fruit.

“The fourth!” Jian Wushuang smiled delightedly.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“The White Blaze Fruit is with Jian Wushuang!”

“Kill him, kill him!”

The surrounding Universe Gods immediately redirected their focus and chased after Jian Wushuang in madness.

“Humph.”

Jian Wushuang humphed and he traveled like a ghost and went through the crowd recklessly. Everywhere he went, he wielded his Blood Mountain Sword and immediately killed four Universe Gods who were blocking his way at the front. Then, he passed through the crowd.

“How could he?”

“He charged out from our siege so easily?”

“The martial art motion is too terrifying!”

The Universe Gods found it unbelievable.

When they had besieged Universe God Tie Cang, he couldn’t even struggle. However, Jian Wushuang dashed out from their siege in an instant.

“Jian Wushuang!” A low bellow was suddenly heard.

Jian Wushuang turned around and his gaze was fixed, “Demon King Ice Feather?”

Demon King Ice Feather, the eighth-ranked on the brand new Universe God ranking list.

“You have already gotten three White Blaze Fruits on the first level of the cave. Now, you want to get the fourth one? You are too greedy!”

Demon King Ice Feather’s voice shook the sky. His figure caught up at lightning speed, far faster than any other Universe Gods.

“Hehe, if you were me, you definitely would be as greedy.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and wasn’t in a hurry to leave but he turned to walk towards Demon King Ice Feather.

As his figure plunged, Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion was immediately revealed flawlessly.

In a short period of time…

“Haha. Demon King Ice Feather, excuse me for not keeping you company.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was still reverberating in the void nearby but his figure had already disappeared before everyone’s eyes.

Demon King Ice Feather looked cold as he stood in the void. He watched the direction which Jian Wushuang traveled in and he creased his eyebrows slightly, “This Jian Wushuang should be around the same as me in terms of power. However, his martial art motion is too creepy.”

Demon King Ice Feather recalled the instance when Jian Wushuang had fought against him earlier. It was mostly the speed of that instant and his martial art motion.

“Such a creepy and terrifying martial art motion. It could really be known as the number one martial art motion among Universe Gods. Plus, he does qualify to be listed in the fifth place on Universe God ranking list!”

Demon King Ice Feather said and then left immediately.

Very soon, on the second level of the cave, many Universe Gods received the news and found that Jian Wushuang had obtained the fourth White Blaze Fruit. At the same time, they found out that Demon King Ice Feather had fought. Although there wasn’t victory or defeat in the battle, Demon King Ice Feather admitted that Jian Wushuang had the fighting power of the fifth place on Universe God ranking list.

A mad fight was still continuing.

Occasionally, there would be White Blaze Fruits coming to the world.

Every time the fruit came to the world, there would be a huge movement to attract all the Universe Gods.

As time flew past, it already became the tenth day since everyone had entered the second level of the cave.

The breeze blew slightly and it was piercingly cold.

The originally crimson space became even more terrifying. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the air, there was even a faint roar.

Jian Wushuang wore a red robe that transformed from Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. He carried his sword on his back and walked forward slowly in the void.

“It has been ten days and it has been twelve times since the White Blaze Fruits came into the world. Every time, there have been two pieces or even three pieces altogether. Then, out of the White Blaze Fruits that were found on the second level, there were twenty-nine pieces in total. In other words, there were twenty-one White Blaze Fruits that would be born one after another,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Twelve births and twelve fights.

But in the twelve fights, he only managed to get one White Blaze Fruit during the fourth fight. As for the other fights, he didn’t manage to get there in time.

Then, the total of White Blaze Fruits in his hands was only four.

“To get White Blaze Fruits in the cave, it doesn’t only rely on one’s power, luck plays a great factor too. No wonder a lot of Universe Gods who aren’t that strong still opt to enter the cave,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Just then…

Hong!

A fierce aura suddenly erupted.

The bolt of aura shook the heavens and earth. Then, it suddenly formed into waves and spread terrifyingly.

In a short time, it spread up to a hundred million miles away!

One should know that the birth of White Blaze Fruit during the past twelve times stirred a commotion each time. However, the largest scale only covered a range of ten million miles. However, the movement covered a hundred million miles this time and it was spreading at lightning speed.

“This movement…”

Jian Wushuang suddenly lifted his head and looked at the source of the movement. There was an unprecedented joy shimmering in his eyes.

“It’s there. It’s very near to me. At most a hundred thousand miles away!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist and immediately plunged towards the source of the movement without hesitation.

He gave full play to his speed.

Not only was Jian Wushuang startled by the movement, all Universe Gods within the coverage of the one billion mile range were surprised.

“This movement is too great!”

“Such a large movement, there must be a lot more White Blaze Fruits that come to the world!”

“Let’s go. Hurry and get over!”

“Hurry, hurry, I must get there in time!”

“Damn it, too far away.”

Countless Universe Gods flowed from every corner like wasps towards the birthplace.

Since the second level of the cave had opened, the so-called largest scale fight was going to happen!
