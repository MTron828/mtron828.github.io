Chapter 2118 Altars

After entering Heaven Repairing Palace, Jian Wushuang and his party arrived at a vast, dark space.This space seemed to stretch on forever. In the middle of this dark space were twelve light balls.

As they walked nearer, they recognized the twelve light balls. They were twelve large, old altars.

These twelve altars floated quietly in the middle of the dark space. An ancient aura radiated outwards slowly.

“These twelve altars represents twelve seats and everyone here will take one seat. Take charge of your own opportunities and you will not disturb anyone else during this period of time, if not I will…” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes.” The eleven emperor gods nodded their heads in unison.

“Go on.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand as the eleven emperor gods moved towards the altar.

Jian Wushuang did not waste any time as he too flew to an altar.

The large altar was made of a special black crystal. There were complicated secret restrictions carved on every single corner of the altar. Jian Wushuang realised that even at his power level, he could not understand these restrictions at all.

Jian Wushuang sat in the middle of the altar. He took a deep breath as divine power started to radiate from his body.

The moment his divine power was radiated, the purple secret restrictions glowed like bright, purple snakes and came to life. As these purple restrictions started to work, HUM!!

A surging energy erupted out of nowhere.

This energy was grey in colour and it looked as though there was nothing there. However, Jian Wushuang was shocked when this power appeared.

“This energy is so… pure!!!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He sat in the middle of the altar and could feel how amazing the energy was as it surrounded him.

Jian Wushuang thought the purest energy found within the Eternal Chaotic World should have been the divine power. However, this grey energy was at least ten times more pure and vast. It felt as though it was a higher form of power.

A beginner cultivator would absorb the spiritual influence of heaven and earth and store it as spiritual energy to be used.

Only when one reached the stage of universe god would his spiritual energy evolve into divine power.

Between divine power and spiritual energy, the difference was that divine power was a higher form of power.

Now the grey energy on the altar felt as though it was of a higher form than divine power.

“What is this energy?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself as he tried to contain the surprise he had.

Even though he was unsure what exactly the grey energy was, the grey energy started gushing into his body.

Rumble~~~ Vast amounts of energy gushed into Jian Wushuang’s body. His Heavenly Creation Skill started to work by itself and started to absorb this grey energy at an insane rate.

“My god. I finally understood why the Heaven Repairing Palace can help some top tier Emperor God evolve into great emperors. Just by this pure energy itself, it can help many top tier emperor gods to try and force their way into the realm of great emperors,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

A normal cultivator needed many conditions before he could evolve from an emperor god to a great emperor.

For example, their understanding of Dao, the amount of divine power they had, and most importantly: the opportunity to evolve.

Now, with such an incredible amount of the grey energy, even if the opportunity to evolve was not there, one could try to force their way through. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even though the chance of success was low for such a brute method, they would still have a small chance as long as they tried.

“This energy is so pure that I can benefit from it greatly. As an inverse cultivator, the energy for me to reach stage three is far too much. The energy gushing out from the altar is still insufficient for me to evolve.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The seventh step in inverse cultivation, evolving from stage one to stage two, did not need too much diving power. Jian Wushuang got his opportunity and cultivated within the Supreme Emperor Stone and managed to accumulate sufficient divine power to evolve.

The divine power needed to evolve from stage two to stage three was far greater.

Jian Wushuang knew this well, hence he did not plan to reach stage three using this time within the Heaven Repairing Palace. He just wanted to try his best to become stronger.

“If I absorb this energy, I will have slightly more divine power. The increment in fighting power is insignifiant. I shall instead use it on my Immemorial Celestial Body!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Immemorial Celestial Body, the strongest Secret skill of body refinery that the Ancient God Clan had.

Jian Wushuang successfully cultivated the first scroll, which boosted his power by a great amount. Now that he had reached stage two of Chaotic Realm, he hoped to be able to cultivate the second scroll.

“Calm down. There must be more opportunities within the Heaven Repairing Palace other than this mysterious power. Let me go and see if there are more.” Jian Wushuang smiled. He closed his eyes as his soul power radiated out. His consciousness melted into the altar.

To be exact, it melted into the bright purple secret restrictions on the altar.

From what Jian Wushuang could perceive, the secret restrictions acted as though they had turned to live snakes.

The snakes were slithering within his mind and forming a complete picture.

This picture was of a sleeping exotic beast.

Looking at the way the purple restrictions moved, the chest of the purple exotic rose and dropped as though it was snoring. When the picture appeared in his mind, Jian Wushuang was shocked beyond words.

He stared into the purple exotic beast and tried to perceive it.

“Dao, endless Dao…” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes. “Supreme Four Doctrine, Nine Heaven God Doctrine… Everything is here, and so complete and clear?”

He was shocked beyond words.

This was because the purple exotic beast looked as though it embodied everything that heaven and earth had to offer…
