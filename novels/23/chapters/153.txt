Chapter 154: Greeting

“It’s him, the strongest person on the Earthly Dragon List, a real monster!”

Next to Jian Meng’er, stood a handsome man with a somewhat ethereal atmosphere. The elegant man was Ling Feng, the top genius of the Tianyuan Sword Sect. At the moment, Ling Feng looked dignified, staring at the demonic youth on the platform in front of him.

“A monster? Is he more powerful than you, Senior Brother?” Jian Meng’er could not help asking.

“Junior Sister, you overestimate me. I know my own ability. Although I’m ranked 41st on the Earthly Dragon List, I’m nothing compare to Xue Yun. I don’t even know if I could take one move from him,” Ling Feng said seriously.

“Ling Feng, don’t be too humble. Xue Yun is strong, but your strength is not bad. Even a few of the Upper Elders in the Tianyuan Sword Sect admire your strength. But, if you really don’t want to face Xue Yun, you can bypass him when the selection battle starts. Just avoid head-on collisions with him,” Shui Hanxin said, standing beside him.

“Ah, I know.” Ling Feng nodded slightly.

As one of the five biggest sword sects in Tianyan Province, Tianyuan Sword Sect could be seen as first class in the Tianzong Dynasty in terms of strength. It also received a recommendation for the selection battle. And the recommendation was naturally given to Ling Feng.

Suddenly, many warriors standing in the area looked into the air not far away, where they saw some dark spots appear.

There were ten dark spots.

“It is Dragon Palace!”

“The disciples of Dragon Palace are coming.”

“It’s the Dragon Palace that is said to be filled with exceptional geniuses.”

Many Warriors on the field were excited again. Those ten dark spots gradually became larger under the stares of the Warriors, and then they appeared in the air above the open space.

“So many people,” Jian Wushuang said secretly when seeing the dense crowd beneath.

“There are many people every time the selection battle starts,” said Baili Chen, smiling on the side. It was not his first time coming to the selection battlefield. It was just that he was only in the audience last time, like the large number of Warriors below.

“Let’s go down.”

As soon as Baili Chen finished his words, those ten figures immediately jumped from the Griffin at the same time.

The ten figures appeared on the ground of the open space almost at the same time. The Warriors, however, who were originally around them, retreated back and made way for them.

Jian Wushuang and the others slowly walked forward along the path in the crowd.

All eyes were concentrated on them.

Disciples of Dragon Palace were so eye-catching.

After all, Dragon Palace was the Holy Place for cultivators in Tianzong Dynasty.

After all, among the 100 people on the Earthly Dragon List, disciples of Dragon Palace occupied a total of 17 (including Jian Wushuang).

Besides, for the 15 spots in each selection battle, Dragon Palace usually won four or five.

With such glorious results, it was difficult for Dragon Palace to go unnoticed.

“That is Baili Chen! The second place on the Earthly Dragon List!”

“Qing Cang, Barbarian King Qing Cang! The Barbarian King.”

“Is the young man with a sword on his back Jian Wushuang?”

“Did Jian Wushuang come too?”

“He is tenth place on the Earthly Dragon List. But his ranking was not earned.”

“Haha, really. I guess there are quite a few experts on the Earthly Dragon List who are not convinced by his ranking. Watch, after the selection battle starts later, there will be lots of people eyeing him.”

“Isn’t he unfortunate?”

“I couldn’t agree more.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Many warriors were whispering, and what most of them talked about was Jian Wushuang.

That’s the way it goes. Experts on the Earthly Dragon List were ranked using convincing battle results. But Jian Wushuang’s battle results were questioned by many people. They thought he was not qualified to be ranked in the top ten.

Therefore, he was naturally more noticeable.

Nobody noticed that on the raised platform in the center of the open space, the long-haired wicked young man, Xue Yun, also glanced at the people from Dragon Palace, with his eyes finally remaining fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, the target of the Scarlet Kill Command...”

“He made our Blood Feather Tower fail two times in assassinations. And it was because of him our Blood Feather Tower suffered a huge loss.”

“He does not look that strong.”

Xue Yun murmured, but suddenly he slightly tilted his mouth, revealed a touch of a strange smile.

“Master has personally instructed me to kill him in this selection battle without fail. Since we will meet sooner or later, I will say hello to him in advance.”

Thinking of this, Xue Yun immediately turned into a cloud of fog and drifted straight over.

“Jian Wushuang, those people around you are talking about you. They all said you do not deserve to be ranked tenth on the Earthly Dragon List,” Baili Chen sneered.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang also smirked and couldn’t help touching his nose.

But at that moment, a sudden streak of light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He instantly raised his head, watching as a shadow drifted towards him silently.

A blast of amazing killing intent had firmly locked onto him.

Many people had wanted to kill Jian Wushuang during his life, but this was his first time being locked onto by such a large and astonishing killing intent.

“Blood Feather Tower?” Jian Wushuang slightly tilted his mouth, and quickly stepped out.

The Triple-kill Sword was instantly unsheathed.

Chuu!

An unbridled Sword Shadow directly cut through the air with irresistible force and swept forward.

Using his Supreme Gold Core, at the peak of the Profound Gold Core Realm, a power which had already reached the peak of the Gold Core Realm instantly rushed forward.

And the drifting dark shadow also directly released a black light at that moment.

The sword shadow immediately collided with the black light.

Suddenly... bang!

The earth and the sky changed color. A terrible roar instantly exploded in the area, like a lightning bolt out of nowhere.

As a large number of warriors around had not yet responded, they watched the space where the sword shadow collided with the black light directly. Two terrible forces formed a violent wind, which was like a destructive storm. It immediately swept out with an overwhelming strength.

Rumble~~~

The entire area trembled frantically. The place where Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun collided was the first to experience the blast, with dust and gravel flying out as the Destructive Storm expanded.

Instantly, the power of the Destructive Storm increased.

However, when the Destructive Storm expanded... a disaster occurred.

“Do you think that Jian Wushuang can get a spot this time?” The two warriors in the Gold Core Realm were standing at the side and talking casually. They were the closest to the point of collision.

Suddenly, there was a huge roared, followed by a blast from the Destructive Storm.

“What?”

The two warriors in the Gold Core Realm were directly knocked away before they could even react. At the same time, flying gravel hit them, causing them to immediately spit blood.

As for the other warriors, they also changed their facial expressions at that moment.

“Oh, no!”

“My God!”

“Run, run quickly!”

“What the hell is this?”
