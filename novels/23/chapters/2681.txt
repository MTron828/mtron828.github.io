Chapter 2682: Forming An Army

The Star Fort was a second-rated clan of a location and considered one of the strongest among all second-rate clans in the Danyang Continent. Its strength was close to that of a first-rate clan.

The reason being their Star Fort Master was a Grand Ultimate God!

They were considered the first-rated clan as a Grand Ultimate God was personally attending to matters there. People normally would not provoke them unless it was necessary.

“This Corpse Palace is related to the Star Fort?” Jian Wu Shuang slightly squinted his eyes.

He wanted to carry out his plans and that meant frantically expanding to their surrounding areas and had to conquer turf and resources without stopping to expand their strength.

The third-rated clans around the Sword Alliance were his main target, hence he would naturally go head-on against the Corpse Palace.

“The Sword Alliance has just been formed and there’s no hurry to expand it. It’s best if we first stabilize it,” mumbled Jian Wushuang before glancing at the group of four in front of him.

Jian Wushuang then ordered, “Dong Xue, the many properties in Dragon City will be under your control from today onward. I don’t ask for much as I only want you to stabilize Dragon City while maintaining its previous benefits without huge problems appearing.

“Hei Yan, you’re most familiar with the Purple Beast City that was originally under the Purple Beast Alliance’s control. I’m placing the Purple Beast City in your hands now.

“Zi Wang, you’ll be in charge of dealing with the other Sword Alliance’s internal ordeals such as getting more experts and so on. All of you can discuss amongst yourself on dealing with matters that you come across in the future and directly deal with it. Only report to me when it’s something important.”

“Yes.” Dong Xue, Hei Yan, and Zi Wang immediately took the orders. The three of them were slightly happy and surprised.

They had no idea Jian Wushuang would give them such huge authority when he just integrated both clans to form the Sword Alliance.

For each of them to manage a city while also discussing amongst themselves and resolving small and large matters was equivalent to completely assigning the Alliance Master’s rights to them.

However, had they not just surrendered and followed this Su Han?

Why did Su Han trust them so much?

They had no idea Jian Wushuang did not have the time to manage the Sword Alliance unlike them.

He wanted to expand indefinitely. There would be too many issues to worry about such as the Sword Alliance’s expansion and strength increase. He would not have so much time to manage these matters at that time so he ordered his subordinates early on to handle them.

About the rights that he divided out... Jian Wushuang also did not care much about them.

The World where the strongest had control after all. He alone represented the highest authority in the Sword Alliance.

“Long Shan!” Jian Wushuang finally turned and glanced at the bald old man called Long Shan.

“Alliance Master,” Long Shan also immediately greeted Jian Wushuang.

He was slightly worried when Jian Wushuang appointed Dong Xue, Hei Yan, and Zi Wang with authorities but had not mentioned him.

“There’s something I’d like to assign you with,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Please go ahead, Alliance Master,” replied Long Shan.

“I want to reassign a group of Sword Alliance experts and form the Divine Sword Army,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Divine Sword Army?” Long Shan was stunned.

“Forming an army?” Dong Xue, Hei Yan, and Zi Wang also had surprised expressions on their faces.

In the Danyang Continent, only top powerful clans like the Crimson Stone Fort, Life and Death Tower, and Nanwu Palace had formed their legions. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The Crimson Stone Fort had the famous Crimson Stone Official Army. During the Crimson Stone Official Army’s peak, even their most ordinary army member was a Heaven Ultimate God and they were not even normal Heaven Ultimate Gods but the best among their peers—the geniuses from every level.

Any random army members from the Crimson Stone Official Army at that time were true elites. They could be described as invincible as they had high combat powers alongside their special military and magic formations.

The Crimson Stone Saint had relied on the Crimson Stone Official Army to expand his territory when he was still alive before finally founded the Crimson Stone Fort which occupied an entire area in the Danyang Holy Domain.

Although the Crimson Stone Fort had declined and the Crimson Stone Official Army was not as good as they were, many clans were still extremely afraid of them.

The four top clans—Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan—had also trained their armies. Although they were slightly weaker compared to the Crimson Stone Official Army, they were still extremely frightening.

Many first-rated clans in the Danyang Continent had also built their legions or armies but their effectiveness was low.

Long Shan could not control himself and asked, “Alliance Master, our Sword Alliance has just finished the integration and just been born. No matter what, we’re just a third-rated clan right now. Won’t it be slightly too inadequate to set up an army right now?”

“It’s indeed slightly inadequate.” Jian Wushuang also nodded in agreement. “Apart from many strong experts, a complete legion not only needs a huge number of martial artists, but also all sorts of similar mystical weapons and treasures. The most important matter is that we also need all sorts of special military and magic formations. These things are extremely valuable. In addition, the fact that every soldier in the legion has a high salary which totals up to an astronomical number. It’s not something the Sword Alliance can endure right now.

“However, what I want right now isn’t a complete army, but only the framework of an army.

“Zi Shan, how many Heaven Ultimate Gods does the Sword Alliance have under our control right now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“If we include ourselves, there’s a total of fifty-four people—ten High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods while the rest are Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods,” replied Zi Shan.

“That’s sufficient.” Jian Wushuang smiled calmly. “Long Shan, I need you to build for me an army that consists of thirty Heaven Ultimate Gods within a year.”

“Only thirty?” Long Shan’s facial expression changed for the better. “It’s easy. The Sword Alliance has so many Heaven Ultimate Gods, hence I only need to promise them some benefits and there’ll be many Heaven Ultimate Gods who’ll join the army.”

“Don’t be happy so early on. I have my requirements.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Not only do I need these thirty to all be Heaven Ultimate Gods, but I also need them to have extremely strong combat powers among their peers. In addition, you also need to think of ways to guarantee their loyalty!!”

“Loyalty?” Long Shan frowned.

“Why? Is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang glanced over at him.

“It’s not difficult to find thirty extremely strong Heaven Ultimate Gods. I’ll be able to entice many strong Heaven Ultimate Gods to join as long as I promise enough benefits. However, it’ll be too difficult to guarantee their loyalty. In truth, our Sword Alliance isn’t a clan or family that gives an extremely huge sense of belonging. We’re only an ordinary clan consisting of experts joining our Sword Alliance due to benefits. There’s an eighty percent chance of them leaving if the benefits are insufficient. We also don’t have any methods to restrain them,” said Long Shan.

“That’s true.” Jian Wushuang secretly nodded as he knew what Long Shan said was true. “We don’t need their complete loyalty if that’s the case, but only their capabilities to fight for my Sword Alliance.”
