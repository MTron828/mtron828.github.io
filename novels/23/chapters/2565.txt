Chapter 2566: Overpower!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang was the only Perfect Chaotic Creature.

A Perfect Chaotic Creature with all aspects of him being truly perfect.

A Sword World was a Principle World, just like any other powers within his body. Therefore, it had been truly perfected like himself.

“Haha, according to Purple Blood Saint a Sword World with fifty thousand miles is formidable while eighty to ninety thousand miles is considered terrifying. How will he rate my perfect Sword World that’s a hundred thousand miles?” Jian Wushuang laughed out loud.

His Sword World was established at a hundred thousand miles.

Through his mind power, a terrifying sword intent filled heaven and earth as he displayed the full power and potential of his Sword World.

The appearance of his Sword World was not much different from others. However, one would be able to feel an incredible power that filled every corner if one was within his Sword World.

“Well, well, I shall wait for the opportunity to try out my Sword World’s power on someone.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly before getting up.

“After journeying for one year and three months, my strength has skyrocketed from finally establishing my perfect Sword World. My sword skills have also tremendously improved in the past year or so and I’ve also innovated some Space-time and Transmigration sword techniques. I am happy with making such big improvements. It’s time to head back.

“I’ll drop by Internal Heart Prefecture before returning to Northern Darkstar Continent.”

Jian Wushuang put on his Golden Glass Armor and used the black stone to conceal his divine power breath before heading toward the Infernal Heart Prefecture.

...

Infernal Heart Prefecture remained Dark Thunder Territory’s top prefecture with its governor recognized as the first-ranked expert.

Even though the Governor had lost face because of Jian Wushuang’s arrival, everyone was being rather understanding.

After all, his opponent—Jian Wushuang was someone who possessed the combat prowess of an Earth Ultimate God.

As soon as Jian Wushuang appeared in the void above the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s lair, the bandits went into a state of tumult.

In just a brief moment, the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor personally went up to Jian Wushuang.

“Master Jian Yi,” greeted the Governor respectfully.

“How’s the progress of those matters I asked the Fifteen Prefectures to prepare?” Jian Wushuang indifferently asked.

“They’re ready.” The Governor immediately took out an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang took the ring and scanned it. He saw there were indeed 500,000 Primordial Stones and nodded slightly.

“Governor, I’m about to leave the Dark Thunder Territory. Let’s duel again before I go.” Jian Wushuang was straightforward.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor shuddered at the suggestion as his face turned chalk white.

He would never forget the time when he was Jian Wushuang’s training partner for nine days. The unpleasant experience was indelible.

He could not help but wonder if Jian Wushuang would call him to be his training partner again.

“Don’t worry, it won’t take long this time. I just want to use your Sword World to experiment with something,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Governor breathed a sigh of relief. He did not hesitate and immediately displayed his Sword World.

Jian Wushuang looked up at the surrounding Sword World before faintly smiling and instantly unleashed his Sword World.

Rumble!

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s Sword World appeared, the Governor’s Sword World began to recede and retreat at an astonishing speed.

The Governor’s Sword World was reduced to only a small circumference around him almost instantly.

“How is it possible? My Sword World is twenty thousand miles. How could it be easily compressed to such a state in a jiffy?” The Governor’s eyes widened in disbelief.

He was especially shocked when he felt the vast oppression rising within his body which greatly restricted his sword skills and strength.

Both were Sword Worlds but why was his opponent’s world so easily crushed his?

“I have only utilized seventy percent of the power which is equivalent to unleashing a seventy thousand miles Sword World and yet the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s Sword World was reduced into this state. If I utilize my full potential, what could’ve happened to his Sword World...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes as he was a little surprised by his discovery.

He had underestimated the power of his perfect Sword World.

No doubt successfully establishing his perfect sword world had improved his strength by leaps and bounds.

“Governor, thank you very much. Goodbye.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jian Wushuang withdrew his Sword World and gave the Governor a faint smile before leaving.

The Governor finally let out a long sigh after Jian Wushuang had left and completely disappeared from his sight.

“Jian Yi was seeking a breakthrough in sword principle with the help of my Sword World, but he has opened up his powerful Sword World after a little more than a year.”

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor secretly and silently praised, “His Sword World must be at least seventy to eighty thousand miles for my twenty thousand miles of Sword World to be instantly compressed into a lamentable state. Well, well, it’s really amazing.

“Fortunately, he has finally left. I hope he’ll never step into the Dark Thunder Territory again.”

...

After getting 500,000 Primordial Stones from Infernal Heart Prefecture, Jian Wushuang directly left the Dark Thunder Territory.

He returned to the Northern Darkstar Continent once again more than a month later.

Back to where he began his seclusion.

He wanted to refine those 500,000 Primordial Stones of course.

Although the number of stones was far from allowing him to make a breakthrough and reach the High-Level Ultimate God Realm, it would at least tremendously improve his strength. Such would help boost his confidence level while facing San Shouwang.

Due to him being a Primary Stage Ultimate God, his Primordial Stones absorption and refinement speed were completely at a new level. He had only spent less than three months to refine those 500,000 stones and improved his divine powers.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes in the secret chamber with a thick light flashing within his eyes.

“More than a year ago, I just made a breakthrough to the Primary Stage Ultimate God and am confident I’ll be able to fight head-on with the Territorial Lord with even an advantage after upgrading my secret techniques. Now that both my sword skills and law understanding have been improved in addition to the success of establishing my perfect Sword World, I have enough strength to defeat San Shouwang. I have the confidence to kill him even if he has a lot of hidden cards!”

“It’s time to go for him after the long wait!”

Jian Wushuang decided in his heart.

He came out of his seclusion immediately and found Xiao Tiexin before informing her of his decision.
