Chapter 2544: The Golden-Robed Man

“Three prefectures were destroyed?” Shi Qianhan and the Third Elder were surprised.

They had only learned about such news.

“The three exterminated prefectures are Demonic Moon, Heaven Poison, and Underworld. Although these three were the lowest ranking prefectures among the Eighteen Prefectures, all of them had a High-Level Ultimate God and around ten Primary-Level Ultimate Gods under their command chain on top of countless bandits. Nonetheless, not even a single one of those bandits escaped the attack with all of them killed.

“I hear the man who destroyed the three prefectures is a golden-robed man of unknown origins, good with swords, well-versed in Space-time Law, and also a Primary-Level Ultimate God!”

Shi Qianhan and Third Elders were startled by the news.

He was dressed in a golden robe, good with the sword, and had a high understanding of Space-time Law. He was only a Primary-Level Ultimate God, yet his immense combat powers allowed him to single-handedly exterminate three prefectures.

The descriptions seemed to fit the person they were after too well. The golden-robed man in the Dark Thunder Territory who destroyed three prefectures was completely in-line with Jian Yi who appeared in the Northern Darkstar Continent and took up the Blood Gladiators Challenge.

They were certain the golden-robed man who destroyed those three prefectures was indeed Jian Yi!

“Elder You, what happened after that? The Eighteen Prefectures have always been known to stand together against outsiders. After Jian Yi wiped out three of them, won’t the other fifteen prefectures want to hunt him down and kill him?” Shi Qianhan asked.

“Yes, the other fifteen prefectures tried their best to kill him and had indeed found an opportunity. The Luo Brothers from Blood Light Prefecture and the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor managed to find the golden-robed man. However, the Luo Brothers were unable to defeat the man even when using their famed fusion attack techniques. Although the Infernal Prefecture Governor is much more powerful than the golden-robed man, he too was also unable to kill him and could only watch him leave,” said the green-eyed old man.

“The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor personally made a move but failed to knock that man off?” Shi Qianhan and the Third Elder were stupefied.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor from Dark Thunder Territory was well-known throughout the Northern Darkstar Territory.

He was recognized as the first-ranked expert among Eighteen Prefectures in the Dark Thunder Territory who was able to perform Sword World and only a handful of people among Peak Ultimate Gods in the Northern Darkstar Territory were able to defeat him.

Although the Shi Clan’s Third Elder was also a Peak Ultimate God, his strength was inferior to the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor.

It was no surprise the Third Elder failed if even an expert like the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was unable to catch hold of Jian Yi.

“Damn it!

“I thought that Jian Yi is just a slightly talented genius in sword skills. I never expected him to be that good, and that he’s been hiding his true strength. Now, I know why he’s so confident and dare to take up the Blood Gladiators Challenge with a five thousand Primordial Stones bet. If I’m a Primary-Level Ultimate God who’s able to defeat four High-Level Ultimate Gods and left the battle scene under the Infernal Heart Governor’s nose, I’ll certainly challenge the Blood Gladiators.

“In the end, our Intelligence Network is too weak and we lacked reliable information. We asked for Jian Yi’s background check when he challenged the Blood Gladiators, but no one had informed us of what he did in the Dark Thunder Territory. If I’ve known, I won’t so easily let him challenge the Blood Gladiators!”

Shi Qianhan’s face turned pale with anger burning in his eyes as he cursed.

Both the green-eyed old man and Third Elder exchanged looks before the green-eyed old man said, “The Shi Clan’s Intelligence Network isn’t to be blamed. The Dark Thunder Territory incident only happened recently and the Eighteen Prefectures are unwilling to expose their failures and probably intend to cover up the news. I only found out because a good friend of mine happens to be from the Eighteen Prefectures and told me over some drinks, hence it’s normal the Shi Clan’s Intelligence Network is unable to find out about him in time.”

“Humph.” Shi Qianhan coldly sighed before finally calming down.

“According to Elder You, even the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was unable to kill him. It doesn’t make much sense to regret the outcome and hunt him down since this matter had occurred and the one hundred sixty Primordial Stones are currently in Jian Yi’s hands. In the entire Northern Darkstar Territory, the Territorial Lord is probably the only person capable of killing him. It seems impossible for Shi Clan to retrieve the one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones back so we’ll just have to suck it up.” Shi Qianhan sighed lightly.

One hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones were quite a lot for the Shi Clan to let go of.

Nevertheless, the Primordial Stones were with Jian Wushuang and they were incapable of retrieving those stones from him.

“One hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones aren’t going to topple the Shi Clan. The crux now is whether he’ll hate us from the Third Elder’s leveled-best failure in attempting to retrieve those Primordial Stones? He’s a very talented genius after all and the Shi Clan’s future might turn bleak if we marked him,” said the green-eyed old man.

“Let’s see if he dares!”

Shi Qianhan sternly shouted, “We’re already willing to take a step back. If he continues insisting on being aggressive and daunting, the Shi Clan will pay regardless of the price to get him killed!”

Shi Qianhan was very confident in the Shi Clan’s capabilities.

Although there were no experts in their clan capable of killing Jian Wushuang, they could always call for help.

Even Earth Ultimate Gods could be made to move with a sufficiently large bounty. He was not too worried about Jian Yi’s arrival.

The green-eyed old man glanced at the Third Elder and said nothing.

...

While the Shi Clan was still in shock of what Jian Wushuang did, Jian Wushuang reunited with Xiao Tiexin in a secluded void.

“Jian Yi, have you rid yourself of the Shi Clan?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“Hehe, the Shi Clan is willing to spend the effort to hunt me down for those one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones. They obviously underestimated me and merely sent a Peak Ultimate God along with four High-Level Ultimate Gods to kill me, but their entire entourage has been toyed by me before I left without them noticing. I can only imagine the Shi Clan Leader being all worked up,” sneered Jian Wushuang.

“You’re pretty much safe since you could even escape under the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s nose. There’s no way you’d be killed unless they paid a great price to invite several Peak Ultimate Gods and powerful experts by for assistance. I don’t think the Shi Clan will go to this extent for only one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones,” explained Xiao Tiexin.

“The Shi Clan is sufficiently wealthy that losing one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones is likely a small matter to them and probably won’t take it too seriously. However, these Primordial stones are extremely beneficial to me.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
