4593 One Move to Break the Invincible Supreme (1)

After destroying countless Daoist Fields of divine power, the two Invincible Supremes finally stopped, and the divine power that suppressed the universe was completely retracted into their bodies.

“Great, it’s really great!” Supreme Tian Yi kept his divine bow and laughed heartily.

Supreme Jun Fu nodded his head and said arrogantly, “Now, I have the power to fight even a Six Scar Void Master!”

After putting away their divine arts, the two of them landed on the ground.

“Congratulations to the two of you for entering the invincible realm.” Lan Lan stepped forward and cupped her hands.

!!

Supreme Jun Fu nodded and said, “Thank you, Miss Lan Lan. The fact that the two of us were able to advance to the Invincible Supreme realm is a sign of the Heavenly Dao’s pity for our Divine Power Universe.”

In less than 10,000 years, Jun Fu Supreme and Supreme Tian Yi had both become Invincible Supremes. Apart from the pity of the Heavenly Dao, they did not seem to have any other fortuitous encounters in this land of great creation…

Supreme Tian Yi chuckled in response. “I think that we’ll have another Invincible Supreme soon.”

“Oh?”

They immediately turned to look at Supreme Xue Bo.

The divine force field that surrounded Xue Bo was like a huge golden cocoon, completely wrapping his body within it. Outsiders could only vaguely see his figure.

Jun Fu Supreme frowned and muttered to himself, “Xue Bo is a Half Invincible Supreme, and he has been on the brink of the Invincible realm for a long time. Logically speaking, he should have had a much easier time than the two of us. Why is there no sign of a breakthrough even now?”

“Don’t worry. After Xue Bo successfully advances to the Invincible Supreme realm, I’m afraid his strength will be much stronger than the two of us,” Supreme Tian Yi replied. After spending nearly endless years together, he had never doubted the strength of his old friend.

“I hope so,” Jun Fu said, nodding.

Only Lan Lan’s gaze changed slightly when she looked at the Daoist Rite Temple that Supreme Xue Bo had comprehended.

The white-haired Ninth Kalpa King, who looked a little lonely, had been looking at Jian Wushuang’s dojo from the beginning to the end.

He was eager to see how this Heaven’s Favorite would appear and how far he would be left behind.

He probably did not even know when he had used Jian Wushuang as a flag and made him the target he was chasing after.

“Supreme Jun Fu,” Ninth Kalpa King suddenly said with a sincere look, “forgive me for being abrupt. Can I ask Supreme Jun Fu to come and examine my state of mind?”

When Jun Fu Supreme heard this, he did not show any displeasure. Instead, he looked at Ninth Kalpa King with even more admiration. “Of course. I can also see what kind of surprise this other peerless genius will bring me.”

Ninth Kalpa King agreed and rose to the sky with Jun Fu.

These vast divine powers that had been preserved from ancient times to this day seemed to be very sensitive to fighting intent, and they were also like spectators who did not mind watching a show. They fought to have good seats and views of the Daoist Temple…

“Supreme Ninth Kalpa, I won’t hold back later.” Supreme Jun Fu smiled as a divine axe appeared in his hand.

Jun Fu Supreme stood still and waved his hand, causing the terrifying might of an Invincible Supreme to burst out. It was as if the gates of heaven had opened and a huge sea was crashing down.

In just one move, Ninth Kalpa King’s power that belonged to a Top Supreme realm was instantly suppressed.

He only felt like a lonely boat in a huge sea, which could be destroyed at any time. Even the flow of his Supreme divine power slowed down a lot.

Supreme Jun Fu stomped his feet on the ground, and the divine axe in his hand expanded in the wind. Countless divine patterns rose from the handle of the axe, completely enveloping it.

With a gentle wave, an axe light that could tear apart the dome of any Star Field burst out from the tip of the blade and slashed at Ninth Kalpa King in a three-edged manner.

Even in the suppressed realm of an Invincible Supreme, Ninth Kalpa King’s performance was still remarkable.

His fist, which was completely wrapped with the might of a Top Supreme divine power, slammed directly into the training hall on the ground. He used the force to quickly rise into the air and paused for a moment. Then, nearly a hundred rays of cold divine power swept out from his palm and stabbed at Supreme Jun Fu.

Each ray of cold light contained the power of a Top Supreme martial artist, covering the sky and earth.

Supreme Jun Fu did not have time to dodge, and could only raise his axe to block.

The cold light only left a faint white spot on the axe.

Descending from the sky, Ninth Kalpa King emitted a unique white light, and an illusory phantom image condensed behind him. Then, he brazenly collided with the Jun Fu Supreme.

Rumble!

The majestic divine power shattered into mottled stars that fell like the Star River. A deep sound like a bell rang from the axe.

The stars scattered. Under this blow, Ninth Kalpa King himself suffered a backlash, causing him to fly backward. A wisp of divine blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

As for Supreme Jun Fu, he was finally forced to take a few steps back.

Ninth Kalpa King wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve and slowly got up.

“To be able to shake an Invincible Supreme realm expert with just a Top Supreme realm cultivation, you’re indeed a Heaven’s Favorite!” Supreme Jun Fu waved his hand and prepared his long axe on his back. “Are you willing to try this move of mine, which I obtained after entering the Invincible Supreme realm?”

Ninth Kalpa King was stunned. He immediately said solemnly, “I’m willing to try!”

Supreme Jun Fu did not say anything else. His gray-white hair suddenly broke free from the ribbon and danced wildly in the air. The silver-white axe in his hand began to shine with a golden light under the blessing of divine power.

The majestic divine power began to be restrained, as if it was all poured into the divine axe. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Nearly ten shadows that looked very similar to Supreme Jun Fu quietly appeared. They were bare-chested and carried their axes on their backs, like ancient giants who had awakened at the same time!

“This is the divine ability I gained after entering the invincible state,” The eleven figures said in unison.

“Divine power — Sky Splitter!”

In an instant, a brilliant light bloomed. Eleven figures raised the big axes in their hands high, as if they were really splitting the sky, and chopped at Ninth Kalpa King.

The 11 axe lights combined to form an illusion of mighty axe and fell heavily.

Looking at the axe shadow falling from the sky, Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes seemed to be enlightened.

It was as if he had returned to the day he listened to Dao in Ling Xiao Palace, crossing tens of thousands of Lotus Peaks, with auspicious lights circulating and long green smoke curling up.

“What is the Dao you understand?”

…

“What is the Dao that I understand?”

“The Dao I understand is to press forward with indomitable will. Although I have died nine times, I still do not regret it. It is the Dao of welcoming death and living…”

“This is my Dao!”

When the sky-splitting giant axe fell, Ninth Kalpa King opened his eyes, and countless cold glints rose to the sky without fear!

What followed was a light so bright that it seemed that the entire arena was bathed in white. The light lasted a very long time.

As the light slowly faded, Supreme Jun Fu stepped on the wind and landed, and Ninth Kalpa King fell asleep in his arms.

“Ninth Kalpa Supreme had an Enlightennebt. He has already understood the path ahead,” Jun Fu Supreme said with a smile.

“You bastard,” Supreme Tian Yi shook his head with a bitter smile. “You’re so rough even when it comes to imparting your Dao. Even I almost thought that was your full-powered strike.”

Supreme Jun Fu smiled and waved his hand to form a small Daoist Rite Temple, placing Ninth Kalpa King inside.

Then, everyone’s eyes looked into the depths again.

“Palace Master Wushuang, it’s time to wake up.”
