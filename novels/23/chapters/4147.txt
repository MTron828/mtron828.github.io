“So strong!”

“No wonder you’re Qing Xuzi.”

“He’s too strong.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The surrounding Rulers were all secretly amazed.

He had defeated four supreme Ultimate Rulers with a single sword strike, two of whom were near-invincible amongst the Ultimate Rulers!

Qing Xuzi’s strength was indeed terrifying.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re also an expert in sword principle. What do you think of Qing Xuzi’s sword?” In the distance, Divine Marquis Qingfeng’s eyes lit up when he saw this sword. He turned his head and asked with a smile.

“Very strong.” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied frankly.

“What if you’re compared to Qing Xuzi?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng asked.

Jian Wushuang frowned and then said seriously, “In terms of understanding of the Dao of the sword, he shouldn’t be much stronger than me, but in terms of understanding of the laws of the universe, I should be slightly better than him. However, he’s still an Omega-level Ruler, and his divine power is quite a bit stronger than mine. If we truly were to fight, he would naturally be stronger than me.”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

In terms of power, Qing Xuzi was already at the invincible level among the Ultimate Rulers. Jian Wushuang was confident that he was not afraid of a top Ultimate Ruler because he had made a breakthrough to the level of a stage four great Ruler and his divine power was much stronger than an ordinary cultivator’s. He was also confident that he could even fight against experts like Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye, but the outcome was still uncertain.

However, Qing Xuzi was much stronger than Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the Ruler Violet Eye.

If he were to fight with Qing Xuzi, he would have to use the dragon-destroying secret skill, burn his divine power, or use his innate divine power to have the ability to fight.

However, Qing Xuzi had only performed one sword move. If Jian Wushuang had a trump card, Qing Xuzi must have one too. That was why Jian Wushuang said Qing Xuzi was stronger.

However, even though he was strong, Jian Wushuang would not be afraid if he were to fight with Qing Xuzi.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was sure that Qing Xuzi would not be able to do anything to him.

After all, Jian Wushuang had a huge divine body and vast divine power. Among the Rulers in the vast universe, except for the Ninth Kalpa King, who had the battle strength of a Supreme, Jian Wushuang didn’t need to care about the other Rulers.

Although Qing Xuzi was strong, he was still much weaker than the Ninth Kalpa King, who was a perfect life form and had mastered the divine Kingdom of one thought.

Of course, Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng were just joking.

“Qing Xuzi is very powerful, but Jian Wushuang, you’ve only cultivated for more than three hundred thousand years and are only a fourth-stage Ruler now. However, your comprehension of sword principle and universe principles is no weaker than his. Once you grow up and reach the level of an Ultimate Ruler, it should be easy for you to defeat Qing Xuzi.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng laughed.

Jian Wushuang also smiled noncommittally.

“Stop talking. We’re ready to attack.” The Ninth Kalpa King looked forward and suddenly said.

Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng quickly looked forward.

In Fengyang Canyon, the situation had changed. After Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three were struck back by Qing Xuzi’s sword, they were attacked by a large number of Rulers.

This time, they did not have any defensive arrays, so they could only rely on their own means to block these attacks.

In the end, they only launched one wave of attacks.

They had only taken a portion of the Ultimate Ruler’s attack, but the terrifying power that hit them had instantly inflicted unprecedented heavy injuries.

Fortunately, the four of them were all special life forms, so their divine power was stronger than that of ordinary cultivators. Otherwise, they would have been killed on the spot by this wave of attacks.

But now, more than half of their divine power had been used up.

Retreat, quickly retreat!!

Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, the Ruler Violet Eye and the other two were terrified.

They knew that they had lost the chance to fight for the godly medicine after Qing Xuzi stopped them, let alone now that they were severely injured.

They had to leave immediately, or they would probably lose their lives here.

However, even though the four of them had retreated and had clearly given up on fighting for the divine medicine, many of the Rulers around them still had their eyes on them.

Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, the four of you have such a day too!!

“Forty years ago, our team almost died at the hands of the four of them. Now that we have a rare opportunity, we can kill the four of them.”

“Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, the four of you won’t be able to walk out of the canyon today!”

Quite a number of Rulers continued to surround and attack Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three.

There weren’t many Rulers, only about twenty of them. Among them, there were Rulers who had been plundered by Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three and managed to escape with their lives. Eight Cloud Demon Master from the Demonic Rain Divine Kingdom was among them.

There were also some who knew that they did not have the ability to fight for the divine medicine. Hence, they simply targeted Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three.

After all, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three were already severely injured. They had used up more than half of their divine power and their fighting power was not as strong as before. This was definitely a good opportunity to beat them up.

The Rulers who had been exposed by the four of them before naturally would not miss this opportunity. They all attacked, wanting to kill the four of them here.

“Bastard!”

Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the Ruler Violet Eye’s faces were dark and their expressions were extremely ugly.

The faces of Ruler Nine Yang and his partner were ashen as well, and their hearts were filled with terror.

If they were at their peak, they naturally would not care about these Rulers. But now, they were all heavily injured and could not use much of their battle strength.

In this situation, the four of them were likely to die.

At such a critical moment, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’s eyes were filled with anger and he suddenly let out a hysterical roar, “Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, Divine Marquis Qingfeng! I know you’re nearby. Are you going to just watch us die and not do anything?”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s roar resounded throughout the entire Fengyang Canyon.

“Ninth Kalpa King?”

“What? The Ninth Kalpa King is nearby?”

A person’s name was like the shadow of a tree.

The group of Ultimate Rulers who had surrounded Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves were shocked and looked around. However, they did not see the Ninth Kalpa King for a long time and sneered again.

“Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, give up your futile struggle. Today, this Fengyang Canyon shall be your burial ground!”

“Hahaha! Ruler Violet Eye, I heard that you’ve trained in an extremely powerful eye-type divine ability for your eyes? Hmph, today I’m going to dig out your eyes while you’re still alive!”

Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, no one can save you today!

The group of Ultimate Rulers sneered as they approached Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.
