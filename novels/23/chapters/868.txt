“Serve you?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew serious.

He could feel the filthy meaning hidden in the burly man’s eyes when he said those words.

“This guy…” Resentment suddenly surged in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“Haha, let’s get started,” the burly man said.

He immediately took out a pair of gloves and put them on.

All the people nearby sensibly retreated.

The burly man stared at Jian Wushuang and suddenly grinned before he charged like a matchless, fierce beast.

Woosh!

He instantly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. With his fist, surrounded by a faint flame, he struck him.

Jian Wushuang looked serious and did not dare to do anything careless. He turned into a Gold-armored Ancient God instantly and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

Bursts of power emanated from the Blood Mountain Sword. Jian Wushuang violently hacked at his opponent, and his sword collided head-on with the burly man’s fist.

Bang!

With a bang, Jian Wushuang was forced to take a few steps back.

“He’s so strong!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The burly man’s strength was indeed remarkable.

During these two years in the Stellar Fog Sea, Jian Wushuang had bumped into many Exotic Beasts. Some of them had strength as their best skills, but they were still a little weaker than this burly man.

This burly man was not only strong, but he also had a highly accomplished fighting technique.

One punch after another, he violently attacked Jian Wushuang, and his essence kept changing.

Sometimes his fist was as swift as thunder, sometimes it was as hot as fire, and sometimes it came down like a mountain.

Jian Wushuang deployed his full swordsmanship, and it burst out as he spared no effort to fight against the burly man. But because of his inferior strength, he was forced to continue retreating backward.

“Haha, boy, is this all the strength you have?” The burly man looked ferocious.

“Humph.” Jian Wushuang grunted. The next moment, sword shadows floated out of his Interspatial Ring. There were 36 longswords.

“What is this?” The burly man looked confused.

“Merge.” Jian Wushuang controlled the swords.

In a second, the 36 Blood-sky Swords formed a twenty-meter long scarlet longsword from which amazing strong power burst out. The power was so strong that all the experts were amazed as they watched the battle.

“Go!” Jian Wushuang roared.

This scarlet longsword instantly flitted, attacking.

It was so fast as it streaked across the void.

“What’s this?”

The burly man was still in a daze, but the scarlet sword had already passed through his neck.

Haha!

The burly man’s head flew off and the power bursting out from the longsword went into his body and shattered his Life Core.

Jian Wushuang showed no mercy to such filthy people like the burly man.

He deployed his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation and killed the man, which greatly stunned the surrounding experts.

“So strong!”

“What was that? Was it a sword formation?”

“The sword formation was so formidable that even Shi Mo couldn’t withstand it, and he was instantly killed.”

“This newcomer is very strong.”

The experts looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of terror.

In this world, no matter where you were, experts were always respected. So it was on the island. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Just then, the burly man’s corpse began to move. Only a moment later, his head rejoined his body.

“Damn it, is this brat so strong?” The burly man stared at Jian Wushuang as he roared.

“How is it possible?” Jian Wushuang looked shocked.

He had clearly killed this burly man and even crushed his life core, but he did not die?

“Newcomer, since you are so strong, you don’t need to serve us. Do whatever you want to do.” The burly man snorted before he turned and left.

The experts who had been staring at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes all grew serious and turned to leave one by one.

They were still talking as they left.

“This newcomer has a really awesome strength. He actually defeated Shi Mo.”

“In my opinion, with his strength, he should be able to pass the first test.”

“The first test? It’s very likely. It seems that we will soon have the thirteenth Heavenly King on our Star Island.”

“I thought he would be a plaything. Who knew he would be as tough as iron.”

People scattered as they whispered, leaving only Jian Wushuang and the bald teenager who had found Jian Wushuang in the first place and asked people to come.

“Newcomer, I thought that you would be very unlucky, and I did not expect you to be so strong. You even killed Shi Mo.” The bald teenager looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“What the hell is going on? And where am I?” asked Jian Wushuang with a frown.

“Don’t worry, let’s get to know each other first. I’m Qian Yu, and you?” asked the bald teenager.

“Blood Mountain.” Jian Wushuang simply said his alias as usual.

“Blood Mountain?” Qian Yu nodded slightly, and then said, “Let me tell you something. The place where you are now is called Star Island. It is the core of the Stellar Fog Sea.”

“Star Island?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

The core of the Stellar Fog Sea was actually a huge floating island?

“Of course, it cannot be said to be an island here as much as a large prison,” said Qian Yu.

“Prison?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

“Yes, prison.”

“Stellar Fog Sea is the second Impasse recognized by the Eternal World, but it isn’t naturally formed. It’s… artificially created!” said Qian Yu.

“Artificially created?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

This vast and mysterious Stellar Fog Sea had existed in the Eternal World for countless years. The second Impasse, which so many top-class experts had no way of spying on, was artificially created?

“How could it be possible!”

“Who has such great ability to create this Stellar Fog Sea?” Jian Wushuang kept shaking his head.

“I was just as shocked as you when I first came to this Star Island and learned the secret of the Stellar Fog Sea.” Qian Yu saw the shock on Jian Wushuang’s face and was not surprised. He continued, “But it is true that the Stellar Fog Sea was created by a genuine almighty.”

“The whole Stellar Fog Sea is, in fact, a huge Spell Formation. This Spell Formation hinders all the experts above Dao Master, as well as some doppelgangers. In addition, it also makes it impossible for thousands of Eternal Realm experts to leave the Stellar Fog Sea.”

“And the core of the Spell Formation is Star Island.”
