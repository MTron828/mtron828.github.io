Chapter 2970: Three Moves

——

“Is he very powerful?”

The other six members of the team looked at each other in dismay, but their eyes were still cold.

“Humph!”

A low humph suddenly sounded. It was the team leader, the tough man.

“Xue Dong King, you know how dangerous this mission is. With our team’s current lineup, it’s uncertain whether we can complete this mission safely. Do you want us to bring a burden with us at this time?” The tough man said.

“Burden?” Jian Wushuang wore a strange expression under his mask.

“Captain.” Xue Dong King was also anxious. “You have to believe me. The brother of the Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed very strong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have become an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“An earth-level member?”

The six people in the team immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled and took out his identity token.

“He really is an earth-level member!”

“A Divine Master became an earth-level member? How is that possible?”

“It’s impossible. He must have completed three ordinary three-star missions of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance in some special way. Otherwise, a Divine Master like him would never have completed three ordinary three-star missions alone.”

The few people in the team immediately began to doubt.

They had no choice but to doubt.

One had to know that they were all earth-rank members. They had all completed three ordinary three-star missions alone.

Even if it was only an ordinary mission, once one reached three-star, the difficulty coefficient would greatly increase. Even a Peak False Saint would have to be very careful in order to have any hope of completing it. How could a reverent God have the ability to complete such a mission?

The people in the team did not believe it.

At this time, the tough man stepped forward and said, “Xue Dong King, you have joined our team for a long time. Since you have been doing well in our team, I can give you some face and take a step back, Ah Chao!”

“Captain.” A person immediately walked out.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.” The tough man stared at Jian Wushuang. “I’ll give you a chance to fight with Ah Chao. As long as you can survive three rounds without getting hurt, we’ll recognize your strength. Otherwise, you’d better leave.”

“Three rounds? Sure.” Jian Wushuang smiled, not caring about it.

He knew that with his Divine Master realm, it was not difficult for him to avoid suspicion, so he was mentally prepared.

…

In the void in the center of the valley, Jian Wushuang and ‘Ah Chao’ were facing each other at a certain distance.

The other members of the team were watching from not far away.

“Ah Chao, make sure you don’t kill this little guy!”

“Yeah, he’s a good friend of the Xue Dong King. Give him some face and don’t kill him.”

“Hurry up and get rid of him.”

The Peak False Saints in the team were still smiling casually.

Jian Wushuang revealed a playful smile under the mask.

As for Ah Chao, his eyes were extremely cold.

“Kid, don’t worry. For the sake of the Xue Dong King, I won’t kill you. But I’ll let you know that there’s an insurmountable gap between a Divine Master and a Peak False Saint.”

As soon as Ah Chao finished his words, his figure suddenly rushed out.

Ah Chao seemed to be quite thin and weak, but as soon as he moved, his violent aura burst out and instantly transformed into an ancient fierce beast that charged at Jian Wushuang. When he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, he formed a claw with one hand, he directly slashed at the void.

It was as if the void was about to be completely torn apart.

Jian Wushuang could clearly see five scarlet rays of blood light attacking his face.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, formed a fist with his right hand, gathered divine power, and then stretched it out.

Bang!

A low sound of collision was heard. Ah Chao suddenly shook his body. His right palm was a little numb and even slightly painful.

He looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise and then pounced forward again.

This time, he used two palms at the same time.

The two palms cut through the void, bringing with them two scarlet flowing lights. It was like a gorgeous meteorite cutting through the void.

However, the meteorite looked unusually cold.

Jian Wushuang’s body swayed slightly. With the help of the space-time rule, he had dodged to the side and easily dodged Ah Chao’s two claws.

After two consecutive attacks, Jian Wushuang had also received two attacks from Ah Chao.

At this time, before Ah Chao could launch a third attack, Jian Wushuang took the initiative to attack.

He also launched an ordinary punch. However, this punch contained not only his extremely powerful divine power but also a large amount of the power of the reincarnation rule. One had to know that his current comprehension of the reincarnation rule… had already reached the True Saint level.

Bang!

It was clearly an ordinary punch, but it was magnified at a terrifying speed in the void. In the end, it even covered half of the void.

The terrifying might completely covered Ah Chao within.

Facing such might, even a Peak False Saint like Ah Chao had a hint of shock in his eyes. Next, he sank into the might that filled the sky, and a large amount of divine power continuously scattered, it took a long time for Ah Chao to break free from the power, but he looked a bit embarrassed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After breaking free, Ah Chao did not continue to attack. Instead, he retreated to the side of the void. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a serious look instead of contempt, but he was more shocked.

The other members of the team who were watching the battle around the battlefield were laughing, but now they could not laugh.

They looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Three moves.

Yes, Jian Wushuang had only exchanged three moves with Ah Chao.

However, in these three moves, two moves, Ah Chao was the one who initiated the attack, but Jian Wushuang easily blocked or neutralized it.

In the last move, Jian Wushuang took the initiative to attack, forcing Ah Chao into a sorry state.

Although Ah Chao did not have the time to use all of his strength, judging from the three exchanges, this good friend of Xue Dong King and the Divine Master in front of him, although he was only at the Divine Master level, his battle strength was indeed extraordinary, at the very least, he should be at the Peak False Saint level.

“Can a Divine Master really contend with a Peak False Saint?”

“Genius, Heavenly Sword Marquis must be a very great genius!”

“To be able to fight against a dynasty for three rounds without falling behind, his strength is not considered weak.”

Previously, these people thought that Jian Wushuang, a Divine Master, would be a burden to their team, so they did not agree.

But now…
