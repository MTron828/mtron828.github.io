Chapter 2499: Killed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Strange Old Feng waved his hand as a hazy purple light was thrown towards Jian Wushuang.

The purple light was a grain of Purple Shimmer with a peculiar aura. Although it was like a grain of sand, it was actually the size of a pea.

“Purple Shimmer!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up, waved his hand, and sent the drop of Purple Shimmer into his Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang was done collecting all the materials needed to refine his Life Armor with that.

All he needed to do next was to find Master Kun and ask for his expertise to refine that armor.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve given you the Purple Shimmer. Can you let me out of this Golden Prison now?” Strange Old Feng called out.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes at Strange Old Feng before immediately shook his head. “Sorry but no!”

“What did you say?” Strange Old Feng was startled.

“If you were someone else, perhaps I will let you go. But you... You’re cruel. You even killed your own disciple. What else can you not do? You gave the Purple Shimmer to me because you have no other choice, but once you escape, you’ll probably retaliate against me. Even if you can’t retaliate against me, you will retaliate against my family and that’s troublesome for me!”

“I’ll have to kill you then since I’ve provoked you and not leave such a risk behind.” Jian Wushuang wore a ghastly look.

Strange Old Feng was cruel, unruly, and despicably. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He dared to madly retaliate against the Great Compassionate Sect, what more towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was sure that Strange Old Feng would seek vengeance with him thereafter.

“Lord Yun Zhen, we’ll join forces to kill him,” said Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Haha, sure thing.” Yun Zhen nodded without hesitation.

The Great Compassion Sect had wanted to kill Strange Old Feng for a long time but lacked the abilities and chance to do so.

How could Yun Zhen possibly let go of a perfect opportunity that lay in front of him?

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang and Yun Zhen delivered their shots again. They no longer held back and went in for the kill.

“Jian Wushuang, you didn’t keep your promise!” Strange old Feng was very frightened and kept screaming.

“Promise? Haha, if you choose to give the Purple Shimmer at the beginning I wouldn’t have hurt you, but now...you should just go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent shot up and combined the High-Level Ultimate God’s combat power from both Jin Wushuang and Yun Zhen, Strange Old Feng could only retreat further and further as his injuries became more and more obvious.

Eventually, his body had reached the limit of how much it could resist.

Buzz...

Strange Old Feng’s body collapsed and his voice completely gone.

“Finally, he’s dead.”

Yun Zhen sighed lightly after seeing Strange Old Feng being killed. “The Great Compassion Sect has tried to kill him many times but his life-saving ability is so great that we failed countless times. He’s finally dead this time. Thank you friend Wushuang. Your prison is indeed amazing.”

Yun Zhen knew the Golden Prison had greatly contributed to their success in killing Strange Old Feng.

Had it not been for the Golden Prison which trapped Strange Old Feng, he would have used his life-saving secret technique to escape.

Jian Wushuang also murmured, “The life-saving ability of this old monster is indeed strong. Apart from his life-saving secret technique, his body’s defensive abilities were also powerful. Ordinary Early-Stage Ultimate God would’ve died much earlier under our combined attacks, but he persevered for quite some time. Anyway, he’s dead now.”

“Wushuang my friend, Strange Old Feng is dead and you have received the last drop of Purple Shimmer. The Great Compassion Sect has fulfilled our promise to you. There are still many things to deal with in the Great Compassion Sect, I shall leave first,” said Yun Zhen.

“Thank you, Lord Yun Zhen.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although Jian Wushuang was not sure whether the Great Compassionate Sect still held grudges against him, the two sides had apparently resolved their conflicts. Unless one party decides to fall out, there should be no more fights between them.

“All the instrument cultivation materials have been collected. I’ll go directly to Master Kun in Luogu Territory.”

Jian Wushuang chuckled and left for Qingxiao City, one of Luogu Territory’s Nine Cities.

As soon as Jian Wushuang arrived at Qingxiao City, he thought of Miss Xiao from Hundred Flowers Tower.

After Miss Xiao vanquished the Mu Clan, she left Wusha Wilderness and no one knew where she went. Regardless, there was a verbal alliance between him and Miss Xiao.

They might meet in the future.

A towering and grandiose mansion floated above the void. It was none other than Master Kun’s residence.

Jian Wushuang had been there before. He had to use some tactics before being allowed to enter and meet Master Kun.

Jian Wushuang went straight into the mansion with an apparition such that the guards did not notice his existence at all.

A bald elder in an exquisite room was none other than Master Kun who wore a black robe and was carefully browsing a jade slip.

Suddenly, a light breeze blew and a figure appeared in the center of the room.

“Who?” Master Kun was alerted and raised his head.

“Master Kun, long time no see.” Jian Wushuang folded his hands behind him and smiled.

“You are?” Master Kun looked at Jian Wushuang in a daze. He was unable to recognize Jian Wushuang although Jian Wushuang looked rather familiar to him.

“Master Kun, do you remember a Chaotic Divine Demon who came not long ago and asked for help to cultivate a Life Armor?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Life Armor? Are you Jian Yi?” Master Kun finally figured who Jian Wushuang was.

The last time Jian Wushuang visited Master Kun, he was wearing a hat to cover his appearance, hence Master Kun did not recognize him at first glance.

“It’s my pleasure that Master Kun still remembers me. Master Kun, do you remember the agreement we had? These are the instrument cultivation materials which you mentioned. Please help me to cultivate a Life Armor.” Jian Wushuang handed over an Interspatial Ring.

Master Kun took the ring and looked into it only to be shocked.

“Four Red Sun Secret Essences, five Red Blood Fruits, two drops of Purple Shimmer, a hundred pieces of Spectacular Beast’s Scale, and ten thousand pounds of Celestial Iron Ore. You have managed to gather all of them and in such a short time.” Master Kun was flabbergasted.

He knew very well how rare those instrument cultivation materials were in Wusha Wilderness.

There were five types of materials and each of them was priceless. In addition, they were required in rather large quantities such that even for a top sect such as Narcissus Island, it would be impossible to gather those materials. Master Kun had not considered Jian Wushuang would be able to collect all of those materials.

However...
