Chapter 2576: Crushed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How can his power be so strong?” San Shouwang was a little confused.

His strength was greatly affected under such incredible suppression. The powers enveloped his body and dimmed the purple light emitted from the Divine Destructive Beast’s surface while also weakening his powers by more than 30 percent!

At the Sword World’s core, Jian Wushuang who was dominating the sword principles took a stride forward.

The moment he took the stride, there was a surging killing intent that grew more intense in his eyes.

Kill! Kill! Kill!

Jian Wushuang’s whole mind and body were overwhelmed by the strong killing intent.

At that very moment, his eyes slowly closed before opening again.

That terrifying killing intent was completely unleashed once they reopened.

It was no longer just a killing intent, but...a heart’s desire to kill!

During the one year and three months in the Dark Thunder Territory, he used the bandits to hone his sword skills.

He created two techniques—Break Your Heart and One Sword One Reincarnation.

Both moves were extremely tyrannical.

However, what took Jian Wushuang an extremely long time to create was another sword technique called the Killing Heart!

He beheaded a large number of bandits while condensing his true killing intent just to create that particular sword technique.

Finally, the sword technique was created!

It was also Jian Wushuang’s strongest sword technique that was being fully displayed!

Hum!

A scarlet sword-light swung down with deep killing intent.

“Roar!”

The dark purple Divine Destructive Beast covering San Shouwang’s body let out a roar as though it felt the irresistible powers contained in the sword-light.

The howls sent chills down one’s spine.

The sword-light descend before the thousand-foot-tall dark purple Divine Destructive Beast and cut its head in half. It then continued to descend and cut open the Divine Destructive Beast’s body, tearing the huge body apart. In the blink of an eye, the sword-light had already appeared around the Divine Destructive Beast’s core.

“How could this be?”

San Shouwang looked up toward the sword-light in front of him with his hollowed eyes.

Boom!

It was an earth-shattering sound.

The sword finally and completely landed—destroying the Divine Destructive Beast in the process.

The infinite divine power dissipated as a storm started brewing.

After a long time, everything finally subsided.

Jian Wushuang was holding the sword in one hand and standing in the void with a cold expression while the 1,800 feet Golden God Shadow behind him exuded a frightening power.

The perfect Sword World was still in every corner of the Combat Ring and Jian Wushuang naturally became the master of this world.

San Shouwang was back to his human form in the void before Jian Wushuang. Although he was still standing, his figure was trembling in a craze as the Destruction Divine Armor on his body collapsed.

“Pfft!”

A large gulp of blood spurted from his mouth, dyeing the void before him red as his complexion turned pale.

He was injured!

It was different from his battle with Pei Qi.

He had feigned an injury in the fight with Pei Qi. However, he was not putting up an act in the fight with Jian Wushuang as he was truly and quite seriously injured to the point at death’s door.

He would have already been dead if Jian Wushuang had gone all out in the final moments!

Completely crushed!

Crushed in terms of Principle World!

Crushed in terms of divine power and strength!

Crushed in terms of secret techniques!

Jian Wushuang had crushed San Shouwang in every aspect!

“Impossible! It’s impossible!”

“How could I, a majestic High-Level Earth Ultimate God be defeated in the hands of a Peak Ultimate God. It’s impossible!”

San Shouwang was in a frenzy and roared aloud. At the same time, he looked at the void beside him. “Fourth Commander and Seventh Commander, what are you two doing? Go! Take action and kill him!”

“What?”

Many cultivators around the Combat Ring were shocked by his sudden move. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

‘The Official Army?’

‘Did San Shouwang just order the Official Army to take action?’

‘Shouldn’t they be fighting fairly?’

On the Combat Ring’s edge where many Official Army’s soldiers gathered together. The two leaders frowned at that moment and looked at each other before quickly making their decision.

“The Fourth Battalion, assemble!”

“The Seventh Battalion, assemble!”

The soldiers of both battalions gathered together and instantly formed two military formations under the orders of their two commanders.

“Go!”

The two battalions formed two military formations and attacked Jian Wushuang.

“The Official Army made a move?” The people around were shocked.

“It’s normal. Jian Yi didn’t pass the many tests of the Official Army before openly challenging San Shouwang after all. As long as he doesn’t follow the usual procedures, it won’t be considered a real challenge even if they engage in a duel. San Shouwang could order the Official Army to take action as the Territorial Lord and the Official Army must obey. This is the Official Army’s rule,” someone explained in detail.

The Official Army had taken action.

The two military formations formed were amazingly powerful.

“Kill! Kill!”

Two low voices were heard in unison as many soldiers in both military formations suddenly erupted their divine auras.

The weakest soldiers were at the Peak Divine Demon level only, whereas the stronger ones were generally Primary-Level, High-Level, and Peak Ultimate Gods with none at the Earth Ultimate God Realm. Despite that, they relied on their particularly terrifying military formation to perform efficiently.

The two military formations were no weaker than the powers of two Earth Ultimate Gods.

It was important to note that both battalions were incomplete at that moment. Their powers would be much stronger if they were complete.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed and waved his large hands as he perceived the dangers portrayed by those military formations.

“Get going!”

Boom!

The brutal sword intent built up and attempted to defeat the two powers.

However, both military formations were completely unaffected and continued attacking Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s face slightly changed.

He had to admit that the army’s formation made things very difficult. Fortunately, he had asked the Situ family to act beforehand and moved a large number of the army’s soldiers away so that the remaining military soldiers were incomplete. Otherwise... Jian Wushuang might be unable to go against him if San Shouwang had his complete Official Army with three or four commanders in power.

At that moment... Boom...

Under Jian Wushuang’s control, the monstrous Golden God Shadow formed a vast divine power ocean that instantly covered the surrounding world.

Its speed was amazing.

San Shouwang initially wanted to flee while the Official Army was fighting Jian Wushuang but the golden divine power ocean suddenly spread out. In the blink of an eye, the void he was located in had been completely covered by the golden divine power ocean.
