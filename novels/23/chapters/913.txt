“So what do you think, junior brother? “Xue Lingtian asked, looking at Jian Wushuang with great interest.

He saw this wedding gift himself earlier, and was quite astonished at the time.

Jian Wushuang inhaled deeply and tried to hold back his great shock, he then nodded. “With a gift like this, I shall never fear what the Xia Clan holds in their hands, even if they take out everything they could find!”

“Aha~~”laughed Xue Lingtian. “Don’t worry. Xia Clan won’t be so stupid to bring out all they have even if they are going to unite by marriage. The wedding gift is all set, and for that aspect, you are on your own now.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“Blood Mountain, my friend. It is time you see yourself out.” Alchemy Master looked over here.

“My third brother, Master asked me to inform you that everything is ready now. Just go for it.” Yang Zaixuan said.

“You can count on it. Have I, Jian Wushuang, ever disappointed anyone before? Not to mention that this time, is about the matter of my life.” With a grin, he clenched his hands. Before you even realized, he already moved towards the center of the drill ground below.

“We shall leave too, Master Blood Saber.” Alchemy Master said, looking at Xue Lingtian with a huge smile.

“Right.” Xue Lingtian nodded slightly, but his gaze remained on Jian Wushuang. He then fetched out a token with his hand.

“We should pray that the Selection Ceremony goes well, otherwise…”

Xue Lingtian gazed upon the token in his hand with a grim face.

The huge Drill Ground extends for hundreds of miles, enough to accommodate hundreds of millions of people.

At the edge of the Drill Ground gathered millions of people who are here to watch the Selection Ceremony. But there are only a few figures on the centre vacant ground of the Drill Ground. These ten people, are Talented Genius recommended by Expert to take part in this Selection Ceremony .

And among those people, most have already made their names known in Eternal World.

“You see that young man in white clothes? Is he not Dongyan Chong from Dongyan Clan?”

“Dongyan Chong has only cultivated himself for less than ten thousand of years, yet he is now at the top of Eternal Realm. He is indeed quite talented, maybe just a little behind Xia Mang. Besides, Dongyan Clan possesses great background which is thought to be only next to Xia Clan in Tang of the East.”

“It seems like this Dongyan Chong has a great chance of becoming the emperor’s son-in-law.”

“I have seen that long-haired man with a cold expression. He is the personal disciple of Deep Sea Palace Master. His name is Li Tianchou, a great genius, and he is already well-known in Eternal World many years ago.”

“Deep Sea Palace Master, you say? He is a mighty Dao Master that even Emperor Leng regards highly. He is now an overlord in Eternal World for the Deep Sea Palace he established.”

“That is Ku Yi, the personal disciple of Elder Deadwood. I heard he is an orphan adopted by Elder Deadwood.”

All these young geniuses have been recognized by the audience for they all have strong backing, great talent and strength.

But of course among these young men, there is someone unkown, unheard. Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang wore a blood-red robe fashioned from Xue Ying armor. On his back he carried a Blood Mountain Sword. The young man just stood there with his arms folded and his eyes closed.

Jian Wushuang was indifferent, though the eyes of the audience glanced at him from time to time.

“Who is the one carrying the sword?”

“I have no idea, but he is recommended by Alchemy Master.”

“Alchemy Master? He is the top alchemist of the Eternal World. Very impressive, but still we know little about his strength.”

Occasionally, people discussed Jian Wushuang a little.

Just then…

Dozens of figures rushed the Drill Ground from the void outside.

The aura spreading out of these figures was so strong that it attracted all the eyes of the people present.

“Xia Clan! People from Xia Clan!”

“Xia Clan has come!”

“The first overlord clan in Tang of the East!”

There came a commotion all over the Drill Ground.

Those figures hesitated not one bit, they made a straight path to the grand stand floating in front of the Drill Ground. Yet only one figure flew towards the Drill Ground down below.

Soon this figure reached the center of the Drill Ground.

This man wore a luxurious silk robe and let his long hair flow freely in the air. He possessed a gorgeous visage as if he was from a fairy land. With a crinkled smile on the corners of his mouth, he emitted a unique charm that no one could describe.

With his appearance, a peculiar sense spread out.

All the eyes of those attending were gravitated towards him, immediately making him the center of this whole world.

“Xia Mang!”

“He is the acknowledged first genius of Eternal World , first Eternal Realm. He is also the youngest to ever enter Eternal Realm, and the true chosen one!”

Everyone’s eyes focused on him.

Xia Mang, is considered the legend of the youth in Eternal World.

Even someone like Dongyan Chong, Li Tianchou, Ku Yi also focused their eyes on Xia Mang.

Indeed they were true top geniuse, but the huge gap between them and Xia Mang was clear.

“Xia Mang?” Jian Wushuang said, finally opening his eyes as he looked toward him.

And coincidentally, the eyes of Xia Mang also looked around and happened to meet Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

And then, they became the center of the whole world. Xia Mang, who captured the eyes of all paced slowly towards Jian Wushuang and then stopped when there was less than ten meters away.

After that, Xia Mang raised his head and looked directly at Jian Wushuang, his eyes covered by a freezing aura.

Jian Wushuang trained his eyes on Xia Mang calmly.

Their eyes met and caused a huge collision in the void. It seemed the whole universe became silent all at once.

For both Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang, they could not see anyone at this moment, all they saw in their eyes was each other.

This feeling was like a needle pointing to an awning.

This unique scene was witnessed by the entire audience. The atmosphere in the Drill Ground stirred.

“What’s happening? Who is that guy and why is Xia Mang so concerned about him?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“There are dozen of geniuses taking part in this ceremony. Among them are some talented ones like Dongyan Chong, Li Tianchou and Ku Yi . Yet Xia Mang ignores all of them, and goes straight to unknown folk?”

“Who is he?”

All at once, many people wondered who Jian Wushaung really was.

And then, in the middle of the Drill Ground stood two men against each other. Xia Mang suddenly opened his mouth and said, “I have a younger brother, my sibling.”

Xia Mang spoke in a low voice, but somehow his words managed to spread out among the Drill Ground for everyone to hear clearly.

“He was killed, by me.”

Jian Wushuang spoke with no emotion, he didn’t evade the question one bit.
