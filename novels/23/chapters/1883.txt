Chapter 1884: Disperse

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Soul attack was considered to be Jian Wushuang’s weak point.

Previously, he had spent a large number of resources to improve his soul. Then, he already formed a substantive soul and substantive soul was extremely strong, far beyond any ordinary Sir Gods. Such a powerful soul was also sturdier.

Besides, he had already found a soul ring in the ancient battlefield back in Green Fire World.

Although the soul ring was damaged badly, it had great defense power towards soul attack.

It was Jian Wushuang’s soul’s reliance. The power of the boatman in black that he was dealing with was unfathomable. The soul attack that he had performed… Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure if he could withstand it.

Hong!

Terrifying soul power was like a sharp sword that tore everything and charged towards Jian Wushuang’s substantive soul.

At first, it was hindered by the soul ring and its power was diminished by half.

The rest of the power was also blocked off by soul walls that Jian Wushuang had put up temporarily.

In the middle of the blurry void, Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth as he stood there. His face looked gloomy. Just as the soul power hit his substantive soul, his body quivered.

There was a sharp pain that caused the veins on his forehead to pop up as though his head was going to explode.

Fortunately, although there was a sharp pain, his substantive soul withstood the soul attack and h was only slightly injured.

“Luckily, I purposefully spent a large number of resources to improve my soul strength. Luckily, I got a soul ring from the ancient battlefield. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang had yet to recover from the attack. He knew that if there were to be lack of the factors, he would have been killed by the soul attack directly.

Suddenly… There was a shrill scream across the void.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes quickly dilated. He had barely withstood the soul attack earlier but the boatman in black’s attack descended again.

The speed was too fast and too sudden.

The most crucial part was that Jian Wushuang had no idea where the location of the boatman in black was before he attacked. When he realized, the boatman in black was already behind him. The attack was launched at a close distance.

“Moon Picking Skill!”

A boundless divine power and bloodline power suddenly erupted.

The strongest secret skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill, was performed instantly.

Then, the Moon Picking Skill that Jian Wushuang performed was aiming at the void that he was in.

Rumble. The surrounding sky and spacetime instantly pressed down.

Not only the boatman in black, but also Jian Wushuang himself, felt the pressing of the spacetime and was greatly restricted.

Comparatively, Jian Wushuang was far less restricted.

Jian Wushuang slanted his body and the black light that was swung by the boatman in black flew past.

“I dodged it,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Moon Picking Skill was originally used to pressure opponent using spacetime while he launched a full attack at his opponent.

Then, Jian Wushuang had used it to dodge the attack.

“Very smart indeed,” the boatman in black was shocked.

Just as Jian Wushuang was driving four Hong Jun Golden Swords and prepared to counterattack, the boatman in black blended int the surrounding grey fog again and disappeared from within Jian Wushuang’s sensory range.

“D*mn it!” Jian Wushuang looked distressed.

“Jian Wushuang, this guy merged with the surrounding grey fog and it is hard to trace him. As long as the grey fog is here, he can attack and retreat as he wishes. Only he could attack you but you couldn’t attack him. In other words, he is invincible,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“If so, I shall disperse the grey fog,” Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze upon the fog.

“Ancient God unique skill, Universal Laws!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

The void shook and there were huge Ancient God shadows that appeared behind Jian Wushuang. With one glance, there seemed to be more than hundreds o thousands of shadows.

These shadows were substantiated by boundless divine power.

“Reincarnation Palm!”

Jian Wushuang roared and a palm containeing boundless reincarnation power slapped.

The crowded Ancient God shadows behind him also gathered boundless divine power and then they swung their palms too. They were all Reincarnation Palms!

One should know that Reincarnation Palm derived from Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the shocking palm that One-Star Man left in his head the other day. In terms of power, it was also considered a fierce secret skill and the divine power that required was not little. An ordinary Sir God could at most perform over a dozen palms after a vigorous fight.

However, Jian Wushuang himself and also Ancient God shadows that he had formed performed the palm. The expense of divine power… An ordinary Sir God wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

But Jian Wushuang could perform it straightforwardly.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Listening to vigorous explosions, the palms that seemed to contain the entire reincarnation attacked the surrounding void. The surrounding void shattered and broke. Only with one round of attacks, the tens of millions of miles void that Jian Wushuang was in had shattered into pieces.

Even space was non-existent; the grey fog in the space was naturally swallowed up mercilessly.

Without the hindrance of the grey fog, Jian Wushuang finally locked gazes with the boatman in black.

The boatman in black was standing in the void about ten thousand miles away.

“Hehe, you are truly an inverse cultivator. Your divine power is boundless. With such attacks, the required divine power should be huge but you could perform it with ease, without any pressure,” the boatman in black complimented. Even though the surrounding grey fog had dispersed, he wasn’t in a hurry.

“Now, you and I can fight a fair fight,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

Just as he spoke, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The four golden lights instantly burst out.

The speed was enough to strike fear into an ordinary Emperor God.

Jian Wushuang gave full play to his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine. Plus, from the increase in his understanding of?Sword Principle, the power of the four Hong Jun Golden Swords was much stronger than before.

“Even without the assistance of the grey fog, I can still kill you.”

The boatman in black smiled maliciously. When the four golden lights appeared in front of him, the black saber that gave out dim light in his hand suddenly shuttled through the four golden lights instantly, like a poisonous snake.

The four golden lights instantly moved to the side from the impact while the boatman in black didn’t stop but appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Wow!

Boundless dim light flowed out and a black saber descended.

Jian Wushuang could only feel that he had instantly fallen into boundless darkness.
