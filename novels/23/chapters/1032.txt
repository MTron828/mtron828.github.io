Chapter 1033: The Blood Saber Organization

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There was a run-down shop in an isolated corner of the Emperor Heart City.

There was usually no customers at the shop, and if it were not for Commander Xu’s directions, Jian Wushuang would not have known about its existence.

A man dressed in blood-red robes, wearing a blood-colored wicked looking mask and carrying a saber strode into the shop.

“Are you looking for anything, Sir?” asked a skinny elder sitting at the shop counter as he peered over.

“I’m looking for Blood Saber,” said the man in the blood-red mask.

The old man’s lips formed into a slight smile as he heard the visitor’s words.

“Please follow me.”

Under the skinny elder’s guidance, Jian Wushuang came to a dimly lit secret chamber after a short while.

He found a spot to sit and lifted his head toward the old man. “I heard that your Blood Saber Organization is the strongest faction of killers in the Samsara Continent, and that you people will accept any sort of task?”

The Blood Saber Organization’s reputation in the Samsara Continent was indeed formidable, and its methods were also extremely effective.

It was said that the organization had even attempted to assassinate a Celestial Master, and even though the mission failed, the Celestial Master was heavily wounded and paid a heavy price.

“You’re exaggerating, Sir. Even though we may be reputable, it’s not true that we’ll accept any task. We will definitely not accept requests such as the assassination of the Samsara Temple Master or killing the Celestial Masters at the apex of our world, such as Empyrean Patriarch or the rulers of the four top clans,” the old man replied with a laugh.

“Of course, other than such tasks, our organization will accept any request for the right price.”

“The person I want to move against may not be a monster just below the Celestial Master Level, but he’s involved with the Ancient Monster Clan, one of the four top clans,” said Jian Wushaung nonchalantly.

“The Ancient Monster Clan?” said the old man as he frowned slightly at first, but reverted to his usual self shortly after. “Even though they are strong, if we kill one or two of them, it’s no cause for them to turn against us completely. That said, may I know who your target is, Sir?”

“Dao Master Nine Sword,” replied Jian Wushuang directly.

The old man’s expression immediately changed.

“If it were just an ordinary member of the Ancient Monster Clan, we’ll not be afraid, even if the target was an extremely strong Dao Master or a Dao Master at the Peak Rank Three. As for Dao Master Nine Sword…” the old man thought.

“I know how important he is to the Ancient Monster Clan—he’s practically their treasure. If he dies, it’s possible that they could go crazy seeking revenge.”

“So, you can’t accept the job?” Jian Wushuang said, having seen through the old man’s thoughts. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s not that we won’t accept the job, but it’s because Dao Master Nine Sword holds an extremely peculiar position in the Ancient Monster Clan. If we get involved in his business, it’ll lead to a whole string of events. Even if we’re the Blood Saber Organization, we can’t afford to take it lightly. Of course, the most important thing is, will you be able to afford the adequate payment for this job, Sir?” the skinny elder asked.

“What is the reward expected?” questioned Jian Wushuang.

“30 Chaos Gems!” replied the skinny elder.

It was an amount equivalent to all the assets of a Celestial Master.

The bounty of 20 Chaos Gems placed on Jian Wushuang’s head after he killed Empyrean Patriarch’s son had already sent shockwaves throughout the entire Samsara Continent, and many factions and clans were eyeing the reward.

The price requested by the old man was 10 Chaos Gems more than that.

It was indeed a sky-high price.

“I don’t need your organization to kill Dao Master Nine Sword. I just need you to hold off the two Dao Masters by his side who are at Peak Rank Three and not give them a chance to strike. As for Dao Master Nine Sword, I’ll find someone else to attack him,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Dao Master Nine Sword is not that powerful himself, but of huge importance. It doesn’t matter if the Blood Saber Organization assassinates him or helps someone to act against him; it’ll offend the Ancient Monster Clan greatly. They’re offences of the same nature in their eyes. As such, even if it’s just to dispatch an expert to aid you, it’ll still cost you 28 Chaos Gems. There’s no bargaining about that,” replied the skinny elder in a low tone.

“28 Chaos Gems?” asked Jian Wushuang as his emotions stirred.

He was in possession of the many treasures left behind by Dao Yuanzi. Dao Yuanzi was an expert from the Eternal Chaotic World and had many assets; he had 300 Chaos Gems in total. Even though it was a huge amount, and the 28 Chaos Gems requested by the old man was not too many, Jian Wushuang still felt heartache as he knew the value of these gems.

That said, if he wanted to go after Jiu Xiu, he had to pay the price.

After all, other than the Blood Saber Organization, he could not find anyone else to help him.

He did not have many close contacts in the Samsara Continent, and even Dao Master Dreamless, with whom he was acquainted with, would not want to go against the Ancient Monster Clan on Jian Wushuang’s behalf.

“Take these 10 Chaos Gems as the deposit. After the deed is done, I’ll pay you the remaining 18 gems,” said Jian Wushuang as he drew out 10 Chaos Gems with a wave of his hand.

The skinny elder’s eyes brightened up uncontrollably upon seeing the gems. “I’ll assign some experts to the task immediately,” he kept replying after receiving his deposit.

“You have to act fast. If Dao Master Nine Sword returns back to the Ancient Monster Clan, or if you let the opportunity to strike him slip from our hands, this deal will be off,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Rest assured. I’ve received the information that Dao Master Nine Sword’s coming to the Emperor Heart City, as he has some matters that require the assistance of Elder Ding Mo. He should be staying in the city for a few days, and our organization can dispatch our experts within two days. We’ll definitely be in time,” replied the old man.

“That’s good,” replied Jian Wushuang as he nodded slightly.

The skinny elder began to make preparations shortly after.

As the top organization of killers in the Samsara Continent, the Blood Saber Organization was indeed efficient. Before two days were up, the skinny elder had brought two people to Jian Wushuang.

“Sir, let me introduce you to Army Saber and Rakshasa. They are famous blood moon level killers in our organization,” said the skinny elder with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang measured the two killers standing before him.

They were a man and a woman respectively. The man wore a cold expression and there was an ugly sword scar on his face. He hugged his arms together, his gaze totally devoid of expression.

The girl, on the other hand, was a lovely-looking teenage girl. She even wore a smile on her face and gave off the feeling that she was a pitiful young lady, but Jian Wushuang could sense a deadliness residing in the deepest spots of her jet-black pupils.

“Army Saber and Rakshasa?” asked Jian Wushuang, secretly approving of the two killers.

After he decided to seek for the Blood Saber Organization’s assistance, Jian Wushang had gathered some intelligence on the group. The two killers before him were among the most infamous of its killers.
