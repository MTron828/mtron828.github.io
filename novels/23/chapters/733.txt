Chapter 734: The Ancient God Baptism

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“No matter how powerful the experts in the Firmament Territory are, they are, after all, human beings without any Ancient God bloodline. Even if they could get some from an Ancient God’s Essence Blood, that would not be enough to enable them to be an Ancient God. Maybe some of them do have the greatest luck to become one, but it would most probably be just a Copper-armored Ancient God,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Right then, Elder Ying went back over to them.

“Listen, when you go into that pool later, try to absorb as much of the water as you can. In that way, your bloodline is more likely to be awoken and it will have a higher level,” she said.

“Understood.” The clansmen waiting to be baptized nodded.

Elder Ying then added, “Alright. The Baptismal Pools are ready. Now, choose one of them to begin your baptism.” She turned to Jian Wushuang and continued, “Jian Wushuang, follow me.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and followed her to one of the Baptismal Pools.

As for the others, they started running to the other pools.

Because there were so many such kinds of pools, they could occupy one alone without disturbing anyone else.

When they got into the water, there seemed to be a growl from beneath them that rocked their hearts. At the same time, the green steam floating above the surface began flowing into their bodies.

They all closed their eyes while absorbing the steam.

Elder Ying led Jian Wushuang to a pool that was larger than other ones.

“This pool is only for you. Different from the other pools, it’s larger, contains more water, and most of all, there is an Ancient God Gem at the bottom,” she said to him.

“Ancient God Gem?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. He had never heard of that before.

Then, he listened as the elder explained. “The Ancient God Gems are part of our Ancient Gods’ relics, and each one of the gems preserves some energy of the gods’ flesh. They are very helpful for awakening bloodlines.

“Up until now, few in our clan have possessed them. Generally, only those who have great potential or high-density bloodlines are qualified to have one. Since you satisfy both conditions as well as being a Militant Warrior, I asked them to give you one.”

“Thank you, Elder Ying.” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“You’re welcome. But, if you really want to thank me, then awaken a bloodline of a Gold-armored Ancient God,” said Elder Ying.

“Gold-armored Ancient God?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and clenched his hands.

“Now, get in the pool and remember to absorb as much water as you can.” In the end, Elder Ying urged him.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at the pool.

Staring at the steam above the water and the dazzling ripples, he took a deep breath before diving into it like a shooting star. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The green steam flowed around the pool like a creeping snake.

“It feels special.”

The moment he got into the water, he felt the steam completely surround him.

He felt as if he had again become a fetus in his mother’s womb, as the magic and gentle power flowed into every part of his body.

It gave him the pleasurable feeling of being limp and numb.

“It feels so good,” Jian Wushuang said to himself as he tried hard to feel the energy flowing into his body, from his skin to his muscles, meridians, even into his bones.

He felt as if his every cell was breathing.

He was experiencing a change inside and out.

With eyes closed, he was immersed in it.

“Blub, blub!” The water kept boiling.

The people in other pools were experiencing the same things as Jian Wushuang, and around the pools, many onlookers from the Eighth Tribe gathered with Elder Ying as their leader. Their eyes fixed on the men in the water while they chatted with each other.

“Each of those 13 people has a good bloodline. I think that most of them can succeed in awaking their bloodlines.”

“Of course they all can. The point is what kind of bloodlines they can awaken. If it turns out that they are all only able to become Copper-armored Ancient Gods, that will be quite bad.”

“I don’t think that will happen. Judging by the density of their bloodlines, two of them will probably become Silver-armored Ancient Gods. Besides, Jian Wushuang is certainly to become a Silver-armored Ancient God as well, maybe even a Gold-armored Ancient God.”

“I agree. I also heard that Elder Ying has given him an Ancient God Gem.”

“Let’s wait and see how long he can stay in the water. If he can make it to a whole day or even two days, he is very likely to become a Gold-armored Ancient God.”

The onlookers were full of anticipation.

A half day passed.

“Howl!”

A loud roar came out from one of the pools, echoing throughout the valley.

The onlookers immediately looked toward the pool where that sound had come from. There, they saw a young man with a face that was flushed red and veins that were throbbing along with his roars.

“He is going to transform into an Ancient God.”

The onlookers were familiar with what was happening.

A moment later, the young man’s body began bulging to over three meters in height.

His body gleamed with a bronze light, his muscle grew big, and he looked like a normal Copper-armored Ancient God.

“A Copper-armored Ancient God.” The onlookers nodded with praise.

After transforming into a Copper-armored Ancient God, the young man gradually restored his calm. A little while later, once he learned how to control the transformation, he turned back into a human being and walked out of the water.

The man, however, did not look happy.

He was frustrated because he had been the first one to walk out of the pool, which meant that he had absorbed the least energy and awakened the lowest bloodline.
