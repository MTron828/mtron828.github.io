Chapter 3526: Traps

There were many dangerous and dangerous places in Devil Smoke Valley. One of them was Whirlwind Brook, and it was quite famous.

The surroundings of Whirlwind Brook were filled with terrifying hurricanes. Those hurricanes could easily kill Principles Masters. Even the Principles Masters of the six states of void would have a high chance of dying if they were caught in those hurricanes, such a dangerous place was a taboo for ordinary cultivators, and they did not dare to go there easily.

Therefore, seeing that Bitter Hand Master was actually fleeing in the direction of the tornado stream, Zi Ming Master felt a little strange at the first moment.

However, Heavy Master snorted coldly and said, “This place is relatively close to the tornado stream. Bitter Hand Master was chased by you and me, so he could only run for his life. It’s normal for him to flee to the tornado stream in a moment of desperation. It’s not a big deal. He’s a Principles Master at the bottom of the four levels of the void, and he doesn’t have any great power or background behind him. Could it be that he wants to scheme against the two of us?”

Heavy Master did not mind.

Hearing his words, Purple Sound Master nodded slightly. “You’re right.”

Although the two of them sensed that Bitter Hand Master was fleeing in a strange direction, they did not pay too much attention to it and continued to chase after him.

The main reason was that the two of them were more confident in working together. In the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley, there were only a few top experts who could truly threaten the two of them, and this Bitter Hand Master did not have a big background, thus, they were not too vigilant and on guard.

After a round of pursuit, the three of them quickly entered the Whirlwind Brook.

The moment they entered the Whirlwind Brook, Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master immediately sensed the terrifying hurricanes on both sides.

Although the Hurricanes were still some distance away from them, they still gave them a feeling of fear and trepidation.

“Heavy, be careful. The hurricanes in this Whirlwind Brook are extremely terrifying. If either one of us were to fall into these hurricanes, we would most likely die,” Purple Sound Master said.

“I know.” Heavy Master nodded heavily. However, his gaze was fixed on Bitter Hand Master, and a fierce light flickered in the depths of his eyes. “Bitter Hand Master’s speed has already slowed down.”

“Mm.” Purple Sound Master nodded. “From the moment we chased after him, his speed was close to ours at the start. However, gradually, his speed slowed down. It seems that he used some sort of secret technique previously. In a short period of time, he was able to burst out with a speed close to ours. However, as time passes, his speed will become slower and slower. This way, we can catch up to him.”

During his escape, Bitter Hand Master’s speed had been slowing down. It was precisely because of this that the two of them felt that they had a chance to chase down and kill Bitter Hand Master, which was why they did not hesitate to chase him all the way to this Whirlwind Brook.

However, right at this moment...the figure of Bitter Hand Master, who had been frantically fleeing ahead, suddenly stopped.

He stopped in the central area of the Whirlwind Brook passage. After which, he turned his head to look at Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master. A cold and strange smile appeared on his face.

“Heavy Master from Star Palace and solitary expert Purple Sound Master have chased after me for such a long time. Aren’t the two of you tired?” Bitter Hand Master said coldly.

“Hm?” Heavy Master and Zi Ming Master’s expressions sank.

From Bitter Hand Master’s expression and his words, they immediately had a bad premonition.

Bitter Hand Master’s gaze suddenly turned to the side. “I wonder if these two Principles Masters are in accordance with your wishes, my lord?”

“My lord?” Heavy Master and Zi Ming Master’s expressions changed.

Sure enough, after Bitter Hand Master finished speaking, a human figure slowly stepped out from the hurricane on the other side.

“Someone is here? And he is hiding in the hurricane?” Heavy Master was shocked.

They knew very well how terrifying the Hurricanes on both sides of the tornado stream were. Even the hurricanes at the edge could easily kill a five-level Principles Master of the void realm. As for a six-level Principles Master of the void realm…they could only withstand it. Only a great being at the sixth level of the void realm with a universe true treasure armor and above could stay in the Hurricanes at the edge with relative ease.

And the person who appeared now was obviously hiding in the Hurricanes at the edge. While enduring the attacks of the Hurricanes, he was also using them to perfectly hide himself, Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master did not notice that there was someone there at the first moment.

It was not until Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master arrived here, and they were very close to him, that he finally walked out of the hurricane and appeared in front of Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master.

To be able to do this, there was no doubt about his strength!

“Bitter Hand Master, you did well. This is for you.”

The person who walked out of the hurricane glanced at Bitter Hand Master and threw an interspatial ring over.

“Thank you, my lord.” Bitter Hand Master received the interspatial ring, and his face revealed a look of surprise and joy.

At this moment, Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master had also clearly seen the appearance of the person and recognized him at the first moment.

Once they recognized him, their hearts instantly trembled.

“God Fei, God Fei Master!”

“It’s actually him!”

“Wasn’t he adventuring in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley? When did he come to the outer region of Devil Smoke Valley?”

Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master’s expressions changed drastically.

God Fei Master was an extremely powerful expert who had risen to power in Devil Smoke Valley all these years, and he was an absolute madman who only knew how to kill.

When he roamed the Devil Smoke Valley, he would kill all the experts he met, regardless of their strength or background!

Furthermore, he was terrifyingly strong. He was a peak existence among the experts of the six void realms. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Such a madman was feared by all the powers, including the experts of the various astral worlds. They did not dare to provoke him.

For example, the Star Palace had already given the order that all the experts who roamed the Devil Smoke Valley, as long as they encountered this God Fei Master, they would immediately flee for their lives. Moreover, they would immediately flee when they discovered the other party’s existence, they absolutely could not give the other party the chance to get close to them.

Heavy Heavy Master naturally remembered this point. However, he had never expected that this God Fei Master would actually come from the depths of Devil Smoke Valley to this outer region. Moreover, he had come just as he came. He had actually joined forces with Bitter Hand Master, he had let Bitter Hand Master set up a trap to lure him and Purple Sound Master over.

Now, he and Purple Sound Master had already arrived here, and God Fei Master was right in front of them, just a short distance away!

“Brother, run!”

Heavy Master did not hesitate. After confirming that the other party was God Fei Master, he immediately let out a roar and turned around to flee frantically.
