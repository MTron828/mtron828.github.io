Chapter 2574: The Real Strength

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hum!

Hundreds of apparitions that previously pervaded the surroundings suddenly disappeared.

However, the fact was they had not disappeared but had their colors concealed by Jian Wushuang which made them appear to be invisible.

Jian Wushuang held his sword hilt with both hands as the Blood Mountain Sword’s brilliance flashed.

The world fell silent—leaving only him in motion.

He thrust forward the sword in his hand.

The sword’s motion brought space and time along with it.

The whole world seemed to be driven around by his sword.

An icy blood light loomed between Heaven and Earth. The sword which leisurely swept across became the world’s focus.

Space-time Swords Technique—Fourth Form, Break Your Heart!

The looming sword-light went straight at San Shouwang’s heart while pulling space-time along to completely oppress him.

San Shouwang was horrified as the sword was too fast for him to defend against.

In the nick of time, the deep purple Divine Armor of Destruction manifested itself over San Shouwang’s body.

At the same time, a wave of aggressive divine power swept up and formed a shield layer in front of him.

Boom!

There was a loud noise as infinitely strong strangling powers broke out in the void where the sword’s edge landed.

Space was about to completely collapse under the vigorous strangling forces.

Swoosh!

A miserable figure was seen frantically retreating to regain its footing in the void after some time.

San Shouwang still had the Divine Armor of Destruction on his body but a spiral pit was spotted over where his heart was. His skin was exposed at the pit’s end with a white mark over it.

The white mark was a trace left by the sword shadow.

“Brat! I’ve been too carefree and looked down on you.” A trace of blood dripped from the corners of San Shouwang’s mouth as he coldly continued, “You’re stronger than Pei Qi. I was careless and almost suffered a great deal.”

“Haha, I told you so.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“It doesn’t matter. It’s not too late for me to get serious!” San Shouwang’s eyes were cold as the ruthless and tyrannical aura in him instantly surged and oppressed the crowd.

A powerful Principle World was then displayed at the same time.

“Are you finally going to display your full strength?!” Jian Wushuang responded with an indifferent smile as his sword intent began to spread upon feeling the Principle World around him. Jian Wushuang had also started displaying his Sword World but only revealed a small part of its power which was comparable to a fraction of San Shouwang’s Principle World.

“Beast King Transformation!”

San Shouwang was unleashing his full force as deep purple scales started appearing and covering his body. In the blink of an eye, he turned into a terrifying primitive beast with dark purple scales.

Swoosh!

The primitive beast evolved into a dark purple phantom and charged forward.

“Beast King Fury!”

The dark purple primitive beast San Shouwang had transformed into let out a roar. Its voice shook the heavens and resounded throughout the Combat Ring.

The powerful sonic attack roar was accompanied by a soul attack aimed directly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had potent self-protective abilities; hence he was unaffected by the sonic attack. Even the towering Exquisite Pagoda’s soul attack toward his consciousness was ineffective.

The dark purple primitive beast San Shouwang had transformed into launched itself at him and aimed a terrifyingly strong punch at Jian Wushuang.

“Again?”

Jian Wushuang sneered. He was doing the same thing as before in the Combat Ring. San Shouwang had used the trick on Pei Qi to counter his strongest move which resulted in Pei Qi’s death.

San Shouwang had decided to use the same trick on Jian Wushuang.

The powers he was using seemed a bit stronger than what he used against Pei Qi.

“Come on.”

Jian Wushuang was not afraid and filled his body with divine powers. He then held the Blood Mountain Sword with both hands and raised it.

With his hands swooping in a downward motion, the Blood Mountain Sword instantly evolved into a huge black sword-light.

The black sword-light rapidly disseminated and soon spread across the Combat Ring.

Endless Samsara Strength flooded every corner.

It seemed to have opened the reincarnation door.

Transmigration Sword Technique—Fourth Form, One Sword One Reincarnation!

Along with the Break Your Heart sword technique, the One Sword One Reincarnation was created and honed by Jian Wushuang during his journey in the Dark Thunder Territory through numerous battles against bandits for a year and three months.

It was powerful.

Jian Wushuang fully discharged his divine power.

In an instant, the ferocious and dark purple primitive beast collided head-on with the huge black sword-light.

Boom!

The momentum was earth-shattering!

The huge Combat Ring was completely engulfed by two shocking powers.

The powers dispersed madly in all directions was enough to frighten everyone on the battlefield.

The residual energies which came from the power convergence point at the Combat Ring’s center caused those surrounding Peak Ultimate Gods to shudder.

There was no doubt that even a Peak Ultimate God was not qualified to appear at the Combat Ring’s center. If one of them insisted on barging into the ring, they might be crushed by the ravaging powers being displayed.

“Is the winner about to be revealed?”

Countless people around the Combat Ring were looking forward to the outcome.

However...

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Two figures frantically retreated at the same time with each taking one end of the Combat Ring.

The two powers which had madly collided in the middle gradually dissipated.

Jian Wushuang held his sword in one hand as he stood in the void while feeling some vibrations from his divine body. He narrowed his eyes and exclaimed in a low voice, “San Shouwang, so you’ve been hiding your true powers!”

“You have reached the High-Level Earth Ultimate God level but pretended to be a Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God. When those Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God challenged you in a duel, you just killed them to seize their Interspatial Ring. Geez, you’re really smart!”

Those words stirred up an uproar among the many experts present around the Combat Ring.

“A High-Level Earth Ultimate God?”

“Did Jian Yi just say that the Territorial Lord is a High-Level Ultimate God?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“He must be joking! The Territorial Lord has always been a Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God, isn’t he?”

Just like any other god realm, Earth Ultimate Gods were divided into three levels—Primary Stage, High-Level, and Peak.

Similar to ordinary Ultimate Gods, there was a huge gap between Primary Stage Ultimate Gods and High-Level Ultimate Gods. The same was also true for High-Level Ultimate Gods and Peak Ultimate Gods.

Similarly, High-Level Earth Ultimate Gods were also much stronger than Primary Stage Earth Ultimate Gods.

Everyone thought that San Shouwang was just a Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God as even he had said so himself. Perhaps due to the lacking of high achievements, people thought that he was just very powerful among the Primary Stage Earth Ultimate Gods.
