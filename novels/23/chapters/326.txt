Chapter 327: I Will Give You A Chance

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Both the first two treasures, the Paleopole Elixir and the second-grade Origin manual, were precious.

And the final item should be even more valuable. However, when the leaf appeared, no one could judge its real value.

“That leaf...” Jian Wushuang frowned, but he could tell that this item was out of the ordinary.

Though it looked like a common leaf, he had a strange feeling that the leaf was like a world.

Yes, that’s it. This leaf contained a perfect world.

“Gentlemen, this is the finale, a leaf.” The expert of Ice Nether Valley said, “It belongs to a legendary tree, the World Tree.”

“World Tree?” Many Warriors were confused.

“It’s normal for you to not know about it. After all, it exists in legend, but has never been seen on the Nanyang Continent. The Ice Nether Valley learned about it from an ancient book,” The expert said.

“The legendary World Tree contains two worlds. One world that surrounds the tree, and another world that is inside the tree itself. Such an amazing tree is a divine treasure for those who meditate on World Origin!”

“Even a branch or a leaf is precious for them, let alone the whole tree.”

“Anyone who is meditating on or going to meditate on World Origin should try their best to buy it.”

His words caused a stir.

“A leaf from a World Tree? A treasure for meditating on World Origin?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. While looking at the leaf, the desire in his eyes was getting stronger.

But right at that moment...

“Brother Ye Chen really gave us a ‘big’ surprise, a leaf from a World Tree. Luckily, an elder in our sect meditates on World Origin, so I bid 1,000 purple gems.”

An evil voice was suddenly heard from somewhere in the pavilion. Everyone turned towards the voice, where they saw a towering scarlet-robed youth, who had a cold smile, standing in a corner on the second floor, and a strong man with purple hair.

“He is the young master of Magic Cloud Sect, Nie Wuxin!”

“Master Wuxin!”

“I heard the Magic Cloud Sect master meditated on World Origin.”

Everyone recognized the scarlet-robed youth immediately.

“It’s him.” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

“Hum, that guy.” Chi Mei had a somber look, but killing intent was secretly surging inside him.

They had some tension with Nie Wuxin yesterday on the street. If Jian Wushuang hadn’t stopped him, Chi Mei would have killed Nie Wuxin. Now, they had met each other again.

Unfortunately, the leaf that Nie Wuxin was bidding on was also something Jian Wushuang wanted.

Opponents always meet.

“1,000 purple gems, quite a big offer,” Jian Wushuang said and sneered.

A purple gem was refined from a large amount of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid, so it was more valuable than Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

In general, the market price for a purple gem was 10,000 Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

Therefore, 1,000 purple gems equaled 10 million Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid, which was nearly all the assets of a normal expert in the Saint Realm.

There were lots of experts there, but few of them could offer 1,000 purple gems. Even if they could, they were not interested in it. Therefore, after Nie Wuxin offered his price, no one bid against him.

However, the silence was quickly broken.

“1,200 purple gems.”

Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Immediately, everyone turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Nie Wuxin hardened his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang as well. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Them?” Nie Wuxin recognized Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei, but he despised them.

He had made them “bow” to him on the street yesterday. Today they met again, so he definitely looked down upon them.

“1,500 purple gems.” Nie Wuxin bid again.

“2,000 purple gems.” Jian Wushuang followed without hesitation.

He had killed so many experts. More importantly, he killed the lord of Skywave Prefecture, Man Yan, and Tan Feng. As two overlords in the Tang Dynasty, they possessed a large amount of assets, much more than what a normal expert in the Saint Realm had. Among them, there were even a few special treasures.

Therefore, 2,000 purple gems was a small number to Jian Wushuang.

When the price was increased to 2,000 purple gems, Nie Wuxin changed his expression. He snorted and said, “2,100 purple gems, that’s my final offer. I will give up if there is a higher bid.”

However, as soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang said, “2,200 purple gems.”

He bid again, without any hesitation.

To get what he wanted, he was willing to fork over all his assets. 2,000 purple gems was nothing to him.

Nie Wuxin’s face fell. He glanced coldly at Jian Wushuang and said, in a deep voice, “Kid, congratulations.”

After that, Nie Wuxin turned and left.

“I didn’t expect him to give up so easily,” Chi Mei said while smiling.

Jian Wushuang had an indifferent look in his eyes. He didn’t care at all.

Soon an expert of Ice Nether Valley sent the leaf to Jian Wushuang and Jian Wushuang paid him the 2,200 purple gems.

With the final item sold, the Treasure Auction also came to an end. Many warriors went back to their rooms. So did Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei.

However, as soon after they left the Dongling Pavilion, two figures blocked their path. They were Nie Wuxin and the strong man with purple hair.

“I told you.” Upon identifying the people in front of them, Chi Mei smiled.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Nie Wuxin, “Why are you standing in our way, Master Wuxin?”

Nie Wuxin’s face was cold and his words were also cold, “I will give you a choice, let me buy the leaf from you for 1,000 purple gems. Or...”
