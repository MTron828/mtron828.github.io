Chapter 549: A Life-Death Duel in the Bloodshed Valley

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There were still ten or so days to go before the life-death duel. Rather than idling, Jian Wushuang spent this time cultivating in Earth Core Palace.

Jian Wushuang had used the greater part of the Monster Cores he obtained from the East Camp war to exchange for Level Seven to Nine of the Bone Fusion Technique. The remaining Monster Cores could barely afford access to Level Three, let alone Level Four, of Earth Core Palace.

Hence, Jian Wushuang spent these days cultivating on Level Two of Earth Core Palace.

The strength of the Origin on Level Two naturally could not compare to that on Level Four. Nevertheless, there was a substantial improvement in Jian Wushuang’s Origin enlightenment after the ten or so days of meditation.

Especially the Slaughter Origin.

“I’ve gained insight into 998 out of the 999 types of Slaughter Occults of the Six-story Pagoda’s first restriction. Only one remains.”

Jian Wushuang sat in the secret chamber with his brows slightly drawn.

According to Di Jing, one would naturally pass the Dao threshold upon gaining an understanding of every Slaughter Occult of the Six-story Pagoda’s first restriction. However, Jian Wushuang did not see any sign of Dao enlightenment despite being only one step away.

“Di Jing’s ancestors were almighty super experts outside the Ancient World. He wouldn’t lie to me. It seems that the final Slaughter Occult is the real key,” he muttered.

The final Slaughter Occult was the last step. However, Jian Wushuang could not gain insight into it despite meditating upon it.

He thus understood that the final Slaughter Occult was a bottleneck.

“I now have a great understanding of the World Origin and Slaughter Origin, way surpassing that of typical Cloud Realm experts. In fact, I feel that my Origin enlightenment is enough to condense the ninth Origin Mark... which still doesn’t show any sign of condensing nonetheless.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He felt utterly helpless.

However, what brought him more joy was that the Triple-Kill Sword made a breakthrough during his time in Earth Core Palace.

The Triple-kill Sword was a magic weapon of killing which was produced according to the Heart-killing Sword. Because of Leng Rushuang, it had been upgraded to a first-grade magic weapon early on in the Nanyang Continent.

Subsequently, its power continued to increase gradually to the limits for a first-grade magic weapon thanks to Jian Wushuang’s adventures in the Divine Land and participation in vicious battles, throughout which he killed many experts.

The opportunity for a genuine breakthrough was brought about by the blood of the demonic beasts which Jian Wushuang massacred using the Triple-kill Sword on the Sky Fire Plains.

Upon breakthrough, the first-grade magic weapon became a Dao Weapon and doubled in power.

“The life-death duel should be starting soon, right?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly stood up and left the secret chamber. He started to make his way toward the venue of the life-death duel.

In the Bloodshed Valley of the Holy Place!

The place was so named because of the life-death duel.

The Monster-exterminating League was an alliance formed by countless human experts whose aim was to work together to fight against the demonic beasts.

Although most of these experts were very united, there was bound to be a few internal conflicts and rivalries.

Some of these rivalries could absolutely not be defused, and only ended in fatal fights.

It was for this reason that the League established the life-death duel.

Any expert under the command of the League, whether it be a Divine General or a Divine Emperor, could apply for a life-death duel if he had an irresolvable grudge which could only be settled in a fatal fight. The duel could proceed as long as the League’s highest tier of experts approved.

It would then take place right here in the Bloodshed Valley.

A month ago, news percolated through the Holy Place that one of the 108 Divine Emperors, Emperor Golden Snake, wanted a life-death duel with a mere Saint Realm expert, shocking a large number of the League’s Divine Emperors and Divine Generals.

Today was the day of the duel. Many of the League’s experts were hurriedly making their way to the Bloodshed Valley.

Lofty mountains surrounded the large and vast canyon, in the middle of which, however, was an extensive space for two Divine experts to fight without restraint. Moreover, behind the mountains was a powerful restriction.

This restriction was said to have been set up by two temple masters. Although they used minimal effort, it was impossible to break in a short amount of time even by a superior emperor.

At this moment, levitating around the restriction were numerous experts who were looking through the transparent restriction toward the Bloodshed Valley.

There was already a figure standing frostily on a void in the middle of the Bloodshed Valley. He was none other than Emperor Golden Snake.

“Gee, it’s Emperor Golden Snake, one of the 108 Divine Emperors.”

“Although life-death duels regularly take place in the Bloodshed Valley, most of them are between two Divine Generals. As for duels between Divine Emperors... an expert of this level is too valuable to the League’s strength to risk perishing in duels, and so the temple masters wouldn’t approve of duels between two Divine Emperors unless absolutely necessary. Divine Emperors are therefore rarely seen in Bloodshed Valley, yet we see one today.”

“It’s a pity that the other contestant isn’t a Divine Emperor but instead a feeble Saint Realm expert, and that it was Emperor Golden Snake who proposed the duel.”

“This Saint Realm expert should be proud of the chance to fight a life-death duel against Emperor Golden Snake.”

“Grrr, in my opinion, Emperor Golden Snake is just picking on the weak. Isn’t it a clear case of bullying for a dignified Divine Emperor to challenge a Saint Realm expert to a duel? I don’t understand what those temple masters thought when they approved of it.”

“I heard that Emperor Golden Snake only proposed the duel because the Saint Realm expert killed his son.”

There was an incomparable clamor outside the restriction as the Divine Generals casually chatted with one another.

Opposite them were a few dozen figures who quietly levitated in the air. These were the Divine Emperors who had come to watch the duel.

“Hehe, what a lively and crowded place this is today.”

“Tian Wu, haven’t you been hacking it in the Monster Territory? When did you come back?”

“Elder Xu, you’ve always been this hermit creature that disregarded the outside world. Why suddenly the spare time to watch this duel?

“Fengxiao, I heard that you have quite a good relationship with Jian Wushuang, is that true?”

The Divine Emperors too engaged in leisure conversations.

There were yet more figures present in the uppermost void. These people were the temple masters who held the leadership of the Monster-exterminating League.
