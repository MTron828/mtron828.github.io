“Your Master?”

Upon hearing this, the red-haired man glanced at the young man.

“You are Swordsman?” the red-haired man said in a flat toneless voice, “My wife has talked about you. You helped her when she was afflicted by the Witch Poison, so she owed you a debt of gratitude. Since you’ve come...”

The red-haired man took out an Interspatial Ring and handed it to the young man. “There are many treasures inside it, which is equivalent to the possessions of a superior lord. That’s my reward for your kindness.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned, but he did not accept it.

“Dear,” Lin Lan shot her husband a disgruntled look, then said, “Master just came to visit me, he didn’t come to ask me for treasures. What are you doing? Stop talking. Master helped me and gave me a new life, which can’t be paid for with treasures.”

“Really?” The red-haired man replied as he threw a disdainful glance at Jian Wushuang.

In the red-haired man’s eyes, Jian Wushuang would not have paid a visit if he had not wanted something from them.

He had seen too many people like this.

He knew that his wife should pay a reward to her master, but things would be different if her master took the initiative and asked for something in return.

The red-haired man also learned about how Jian Wushuang helped his wife. In his judgment, Jian Wushuang was probably a Saint Realm expert who was at Stage Two or Stage Three at that time.

Therefore, he did not put Jian Wushuang in his eyes.

He thought that all the possessions of a superior lord would be a pretty penny for Jian Wushuang and that it was enough to show his appreciation.

Jian Wushuang was annoyed and amused when he saw the red-haired man’s expression.

He had intended to see whether his disciple was well, but he was treated as a beggar by her husband.

“Disciple, this is your husband?” Jian Wushuang asked with a meaningful smile.

“Yes, he is Guyang.” Lin Lan responded awkwardly.

“Marquis Guyang?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

He had heard about him. As one of the 72 Marquises, Marquis Guyang was irritable and straightforward.

He had lived in this world for long time and experienced a lot, so he thought less of Jian Wushuang.

“Marquis Guyang, take back your Interspatial Ring.” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“What? It’s not enough?” Marquis Guyang asked.

Jian Wushuang forced a smile. If he had not noticed Lin Lan’s imploring look, he would have given Marquis Guyang a slap.

At this point...

“Guyang. Lanyue!”

A resonant voice reverberated.

“Hum?” Marquis Guyang looked up to the sky, the said, “Little Lan, my friend is here. Let’s go to greet him.”

“OK.” Marquis Lanyue knew this friend and did not dare to take it lightly.

“Master, please wait for a moment,” she said to her master.

“Go ahead!” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

“Little Lan, hurry up. Don’t let him wait long.” Marquis Guyang urged his wife.

Marquis Guyang and Lin Lan glided away.

After a while, Jian Wushuang saw them slowly approaching with a muscular purple-robed man.

When he saw the purple-robed man clearly, Jian Wushuang’s expression became a bit odd.

”?Is it him? Unbelievable!?”

“Now, things are getting interesting!”?Jian Wushuang thought with a meaningful smile.

In the sky, Marquis Guyang and Lin Lan walked side by side.

“Bro Zizhong, it’s all thanks to you. Because of you, my wife and I will be able to go to the Holy Ancestor Feast. Now that you’ve come here, we will definitely treat you well.”

“Guyang, we have been friends for many years. Such a little thing is not worth mentioning,” the purple-robed man said with a faint smile, “But speaking of this Holy Ancestor Feast, many experts will attend it and even some super experts outside of the Divine Land have been invited, so we’re lucky to get a look at the super experts in the party.

“Haha, right. The Holy Ancestor Feast is the greatest feast in our Divine Land,” Marquis Guyang proclaimed.

Lin Lan quietly listened to their conversation.

The three of them quickly flew into the mansion.

The moment they landed on the ground, the purple-robed man immediately recognized Jian Wushuang.

He was stunned.

He stopped as he widened his eyes, staring at the black-robed youth.

An unprecedented terror struck his heart.

“Brother Zizhong, what happened?”

Marquis Guyang and Lin Lan looked over at the purple-robed man with a puzzled expression.

“You, it’s you!” the purple-robed man murmured while pointing at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also considered him with a grim smile. “Marquis Zizhong, long time no see. You’re still looking well!”

Marquis Zizhong!

Su Ming had sent Marquis Zizhong to kill Jian Wushuang. Although Jian Wushuang had been much weaker than he was now, Marquis Zizhong had still been unable to dispatch him.

As a result, Marquis Zizhong had been forced to retreat and was almost killed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not expect to bump into Marquis Zizhong at his disciple’s mansion.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The grim-faced Marquis Zizhong fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang as he perceived the Cloud Realm aura on this young man.

“He has made a breakthrough?”?Marquis Zizhong was rocked.

Even when he was in the Saint Realm, Jian Wushuang had been able to repel him, so he must be even more powerful now after the breakthrough.

”?Run!?” Marquis Zizhong escaped without hesitation, ignoring Marquis Guyang and Lin Lan.

“Hehe, since you’re here, why are you in a hurry to leave?”

Jian Wushuang’s cold laughter resounded through the area.
