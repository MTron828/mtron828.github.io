2308 Enter the Lin Mansion

“Brother Lin. I thank you for your good will. However, Wushuang is a very stubborn boy. I tried my best to send him into a clan so that he could get the best teachers. He alway rejects my offer. Now that you want him to go with you back to the Lin Mansion...” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Okay. I will go to the Lin Mansion,” Jian Wushuang interrupted Zhuo Yunfeng and said.

“What?” Zhuo Yunfeng was stunned as he looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

This brat. He had never wanted to leave the Incineration Moon City. What had happened to him today? Had he... changed his mind?

“Haha. That is great.” Lin Tiefeng was elated.

The Lin Family would be honoured if a kid as talented as Jian Wushuang would stay at their mansion for even a short period of time.

“How about this: we will celebrate your father’s birthday tomorrow and we will leave the day after?” Lin Tiefeng said.

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

The reason Jian Wushuang had agreed to go to the Lin Mansion was not only because he could get access to the secret skills within their library, but he could also come back and visit anytime he wanted to. He would not be able to do so if he joined a clan as there were many restrictions.

Just like his older brother Zhuo Peng and his eldest sister, who he had never met before, they would only come back once in a while.

However, he could leave the Lin Mansion whenever he wanted to. Furthermore, the Lin Mansion was closely located to the Incineration Moon City.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang agreed so readily, Zhuo Yunfeng was also happy.

He was happy that Jian Wushuang was leaving home. Now that he was going to the Lin Mansion... Even though the Lin Mansion was not as well known as some other clans, it was a big family and there was a system in place to train and develop disciples. It also had a lot of resources necessary for cultivation. Zhuo Yunfeng believed that Jian Wushuang would not be treated unfairly given his close relations with Lin Tiefieng.

Jian Wushuang would be able to train and cultivate in a better environment.

Everyone started preparing for Zhuo Yunfeng’s birthday celebration.

The birthday celebration went smoothly and everyone was extremely happy.

After the birthday celebration, Jian Wushuang left with Lin Tiefeng for the Lin Mansion.

...

Lin Mansion. The Lin Family was one of the six top tier families and had an extremely solid foundation.

The Lin Mansion occupied thousands of square feet and it looked very majestic.

Jian Wushuang entered the Lin Mansion under the guidance of Lin Tiefeng. Lin Tiefeng gave the order that Jian Wushuang could go enter the Secret Skill Pavilion as he liked and could study any martial art skills or secret skills he wanted.

Furthermore, they were planning to give Jian Wushuang three times the amount of resources that their core disciple had!

A core disciple in the Transformed God Realm would get one God Transformation Elixir, but Jian Wushuang would get three.

There was a ruckus within the Lin Mansion when everyone found out the treatment Jian Wushuang was getting.

Jian Wushuang lived in a well-designed house which only an important guest could stay in.

Jian Wushuang sat on a stone bench at the centre of the garden with a jade bamboo strip in his hands.

The contents of the jade bamboo strip was a copy of one of the secret skills that Jian Wushuang had seen in the Secret Skill Pavilion.

It was Sword Principle Snow Congelation.

“This sword skill can make even snow freeze in the air. There is a trace of Spacetime Rules of Order within this sword skill.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Spacetime Rules of Order was extremely complex and complicated.

If one mastered this sword skill and had a good understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order, everything in this world would freeze in place when this sword skill was used.

This was an incredible sword skill.

“Even though this sword skill is good, I do not have the ability to learn it yet. However, I can learn many things just by studying it and applying it to the Timespace Sword Principle.” Jian Wushuang started to focus on the content on the jade bamboo strip.

Before long...

“Brother Wushuang.”

A loud voice was heard as two figures stepped into the garden.

Jian Wushuang looked up.

One of the two was Lin Yan.

After Jian Wushuang had defeated Lin Yan a few days ago by using purely his sword skills, Lin Yan had no longer been arrogant and had stopped trying to compete with Jian Wushuang.

Lin Yan was a straightforward man. After getting close to Jian Wushuang, he had started to treat Jian Wushuang as a brother.

There was a young girl standing behind Lin Yan. She was around twelve or thirteen years old. She looked pale and yellow and seemed delicate. Without a doubt, she was pretty.

“Prince Yan, is something up?” Jian Wushuang asked, his eyes fixed on the jade bamboo strip in his hands.

“Haha. Today is the day that the Lin Mansion gives out elixirs. I know that you will drown yourself in studying the Sword Doctrine, hence I have brought over the three God Transformation Elixir for you,” Lian Yan opened his palm and Jian Wushuang saw three light purple elixirs.

“God Transformation Elixir?” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

To any expert in the Transformed God Realm, this elixir would be extremely useful as it would make it easier for them to accumulate divine power.

However, Jian Wushuang had reincarnated. He was already at the level of a Chaotic Divine Demon. All he had to do was accumulate Divine Power.

The God Transformation Elixir was not very useful for him.

After all, he was a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform. The amount of spiritual influence of heaven and earth he required for each stage of his cultivation was far too much. Furthermore, the speed at which he absorbed the spiritual influence of heaven and earth was insanely fast.

He could absorb equal amounts of divine power within the three God Transformation Elixir within one day.

This elixir was almost useless for him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You wouldn’t be so nice unless you have something to ask me, so what do you want me to do for you?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Yan and said.

“Haha. You saw through my plan.” Lin Yan gave an awkward smile. He pulled over the young girl and said, “Brother Wushuang, this is my cousin. She is about the same age as you and practices the sword doctrine. She is facing difficulty in one of the sword skills she is practicing, hence...”

“You want me to guide her?” Jian Wushuang looked over and sighed.

“Yes.” Lin Yan nodded his head before he said to Lin Qingqing, “Cousin, tell Brother Wushuang about the problems you face. He can definitely solve them for you.”

Lin Qingqing knitted her eyebrows. She did not say anything and looked at Jian Wushuang with suspicion.

Jian Wushuang was around the same age as her, how could one blame her for suspecting whether or not Jian Wushuang had the ability to guide her in her sword skills?

Furthermore, even the experts in the Pure Sun Realm and Chaotic Realm within the Lin Mansion could not solve her problem.
