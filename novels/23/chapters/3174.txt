“It shouldn’t be. If the value of the universe crystal is less than a drop of divine power, Elder Xue Bei would never take the universe crystal so seriously.” Jian Wushuang frowned and thought to himself.

Temple Master Bai Xing continued, “The first floor of the Temporal Tower of the spacetime temple is open to all the cultivators under our command, but the second floor requires divine power. A drop of divine power can allow you to stay on the second floor for a year. Of course, the year mentioned here is a year in the outside world, but in the second floor of the Temporal Tower, it’s 100 years.

“As for the third floor, it’s even more ridiculous. Only 10 drops of divine power can stay on the second floor for a year.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang secretly clicked his tongue.

Only one drop of divine power could stay on the second floor for a year?

As for the third floor, it required 10 drops of divine power to stay on the third floor for a year?

After all, one drop of divine power required 10 billion holy elixirs to exchange. 10 drops… that was 100 billion holy elixirs!

“I can’t enter the second and third floors of the Temporal Tower,” Jian Wushuang said on the spot.

“Haha, you’re right. For a true saint like you, the first floor is enough. There’s no need to go to the second and third floors. Those two floors are for Principles Masters.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled.

“These Principles Masters are powerful, and they study secret skills or absolute arts of a high level. Naturally, they need to spend more time. Sometimes, it takes tens of thousands of years or hundreds of thousands of years to study a secret skill absolute art. Such a long time is not too short even for Principles Masters. Therefore, many people are willing to spend some divine power in this Temporal Tower.”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years…some Principles Masters who were very old would not think much of it, but for some younger Principles Masters, it was a long time. In the outside world, such a long time…could do a lot of things.

“Let’s go, I’ll take you to a place in my Temporal Temple.”

Temple Master Bai Xing brought Jian Wushuang away from the Temporal Tower. Soon, they came to a purple pavilion.

“This is the secret technique pavilion of my Temporal Temple, which contains the secret techniques created by many experts of my Temporal Temple, and most of these secret techniques are targeted at the aspect of space and time.” As he spoke to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang kept looking around.

There were many special tokens floating around him. These tokens contained secret skills. There were probably thousands of them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“So many secret skills are related to space-time?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“Of course, not only that. These secret skills were created by the Principles Master and are very powerful. However, the secret skills here are not complete. They are just beginner-level secret skills,” Temple Master Bai Xing said, “According to the rules of our Temporal Temple, the secret skills in the secret pavilion are open to all the cultivators under your command. However, after you choose a secret skill, you can only get the beginner-level secret skill in the beginning.”

“After you get the beginner-level secret skill, you will have a time limit. Only when you reach the beginner-level of this secret skill within this time limit can you prove that you have the ability and qualification to cultivate this secret skill. Then, you can get the complete secret skill.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

Although the secret skills of the secret pavilion were open to all the cultivators in the Temporal Temple, there was a certain level of authority, which could prevent many people from blindly pursuing and cultivating more secret skills.

One could not bite off more than one could chew. Secret skills were only useful if they were truly suitable for oneself. Moreover, one did not need to master too many secret skills, so there was no need to spend too much energy on them.

“Let’s go to the third floor,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

There were three floors in the secret skill pavilion.

The first floor had the most secret skills, while the second floor had fewer secret skills. There were less than 100 secret skills, but they were obviously more powerful.

And on the third floor…

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

When he reached the third floor of the secret skill pavilion, he saw seven black stone tablets instead of a floating special token.

Each of the seven stone tablets was extremely tall, and the word ‘Space-time’ was carved in the center of each stone tablet.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, what are these seven stone tablets?” Jian Wushuang asked in puzzlement.

“This is the secret skill pavilion. The third floor is the record of the most powerful secret skill of our Temporal Temple. Don’t you know what the most powerful secret skill is?” Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Is it the spacetime divine skill?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Yes.”Temple Master Bai Xing nodded.

“But why are there seven stone tablets here?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“It’s very simple. There are seven moves of the spacetime divine skill,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

“Each of these seven stone tablets contains a move of the spacetime divine skill. They have been standing here for a long time. However, very few people have been able to comprehend the spacetime divine skill from these seven stone tablets,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

After all, it was the most powerful divine skill created by the great Temple Master of space-time. How could anyone casually comprehend it?

“Little guy, you comprehended the space-time divine skill through the space-time stone, but as far as I know, the space-time divine skill contained in the space-time stone is not complete, right?” Temple Master Bai Xing asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “There are two divine skills contained in the spacetime gold stone. The first one is the heaven-designated skill, and the second one is the void-annihilation skill. As for the next three to seven moves, there are none.”

“Now you can directly comprehend the third move from the third stone tablet,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang immediately walked forward.

He walked to the third stone tablet and sat down with his legs crossed. His consciousness was completely immersed in the stone tablet. To be exact, it was the word ‘Space-time’ in the center of the stone tablet.

After a short while…the screen turned, and Jian Wushuang suddenly came to a vast dark void.

In the dark void, the hazy figure was still standing there. The world was originally calm.

Suddenly…the hazy figure took a step forward.

It was a simple step, but it instantly crossed space-time and appeared in the void hundreds of millions of miles away.

The scene quickly disappeared.

Under the stone tablet, Jian Wushuang’s expression was extremely shocked.

“This is the third move of the spacetime divine skill, teleportation?”

“No, it’s spacetime teleportation!”

“But why does it feel exactly the same as teleportation?”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

In the picture, the shadowy figure’s method indeed looked exactly the same as teleportation!

But teleportation, as long as one’s comprehension of the space-time principles reached the fourth stage, he could master it?
