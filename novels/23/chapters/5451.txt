Chapter 5450 ¬†Jueyun Sword

This time, Jian Wushuang didn't hold back and directly accepted it.

Who was Wu Zuo's master?

It was Qishen, and Qishen had obtained some small treasures for his disciples outside. Could it be inferior?

"Thank you, Emperor!"

Jueyun Sword!

The personal sword of Emperor Jueyun, with astonishing power contained above.

Although Wu Zuo felt a bit distressed, the Dragon Prolonging Fruit wasn't very useful to him. If it's given, it's given. Compared to the Jueyun Sword, it was still far behind.

This Jueyun Sword accompanied Emperor Jueyun in battles across the four directions, killing countless peak-level experts and even contending with Universe Masters.

Although it was still at the level of an Eternal Treasure, if Emperor Jueyun were to ascend to the Universe Master, the Jueyun Sword would probably also ascend to become a Universe Treasure.

Jian Wushuang took out the Jueyun Sword. Due to the rapid increase in his strength, he hadn't used such a handy long sword in a long time.

Just as he dared to raise his hand to draw it, he was stopped by Wu Zuo.

"This sword, Jueyun, contains the Emperor's Ultimate Sword Dao. It's not easy to draw it out. You must have strong determination; otherwise, it will backlash against you," Wu Zuo advised.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Indeed, he felt the powerful sword intent within the scabbard, but he still wanted to give it a try.

No way, how could a swordsman resist the temptation to draw out a peerless sword?

Clang!

Jian Wushuang gripped the hilt, firm in his resolve to infuse the power of the Ultimate Sword Dao, and forcefully pulled!

The long sword, Jueyun, appeared once again!

A sharp Sword Qi surged within a radius of a million miles.

This frightened Gong Miaoyi beside him, causing her to retreat repeatedly.

Wu Zuo was also greatly shocked!

He didn't expect Jian Wushuang to draw out the Jueyun Sword in one go.

"Indeed, it's a remarkable sword!" Jian Wushuang casually moved his wrist, causing the Decree Cloud Sword to dance, and he could feel the sword qi circulating throughout his body.

Although Wu Zuo was shocked, he wasn't overly surprised. Jian Wushuang was one of the top ultimate Dao Monarchs chosen by Zhen Ling. How could he be any less? Perhaps in the future, he could even reach the level of Emperor Jueyun.

Thinking of this, there was a tremor in his heart.

The strength of Emperor Jueyun could rival those Universe Masters, surpassing the 18 divine generals.

He was a formidable existence stronger than several direct disciples under Qishen.

Back then, he was only a named disciple, a pinnacle powerhouse in the supreme-peak level, but at most, he could match the 18 divine generals under Qishen.

However, Emperor Jueyun could easily crush those generals with a mere flick of his hand.

"Alright, the gift has been delivered, and it's time for me to leave with my people!" Wu Zuo revealed a calm smile.

Jian Wushuang sheathed the Jueyun Sword and hurriedly asked, "Emperor Wu Zuo, are you planning to take your people to the Heavenly Realm?"

"Yes, it's time to leave. The current Earth Realm is unstable, and it's better to leave early. We can't handle the mess here." Wu Zuo paused in his departure to explain to Jian Wushuang.

The Earth Realm was now in chaos, and if they didn't leave, they would be left behind by Zhen Ling to clean up the mess for the White Tiger Temple.

Wu Zuo had no intention of doing free labor.

Seeing the opportunity, Jian Wushuang tactfully said, "Coincidentally, I'm also planning to visit the Heavenly Realm. I want to pay a visit to Senior Qiu in the Elder Palace. It would be convenient to travel back together with you, Emperor."

"Good, come with me!" Wu Zuo didn't mind, thinking that bringing one more person along wouldn't make much of a difference.

Gong Miaoyi, who had been standing in the distance, looked somewhat astonished.

The Inheritors were indeed extraordinary, each with a powerful backing. Any random one among them was at the pinnacle of existence, able to give away numerous treasures, causing envy among onlookers.

Especially when he mentioned going to the Heavenly Realm.

You see, it's easy to travel from the Heavenly Realm to the Earthly Realm, costing only a small amount of godstones.

But the amount of godstones required to travel from the Earthly Realm to the Heavenly Realm was astronomical.

Moreover, the teleportation array to the Heavenly Realm in the center of the Earthly Realm was under the jurisdiction of the temple. To go to the Heavenly Realm, one not only had to pay a massive amount of godstones but also undergo various interrogations.

Those with a tainted background simply couldn't go to the Heavenly Realm.

Gong Miaoyi was moved. Her father was in the Heavenly Realm, and she also wanted to go there. However, the cost was too high, and even now, it would be troublesome for her to go to the Heavenly Realm.

Now, there was an excellent opportunity before her.

Emperor Wu Zuo's strength transcended boundaries, and his identity was extraordinary; he could freely pass through the barriers between realms.

At this moment, clinging to Jian Wushuang's thigh, she might be able to go to the Heavenly Realm together.

Thinking of this, Gong Miaoyi quickly and reluctantly asked, "Brother Wushuang, what should I do?"

The question was quite clever. Wu Zuo glanced at her and then looked at Jian Wushuang, revealing a smile of understanding.

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly. He knew that Gong Miaoyi's father was in the Heavenly Realm and that she wanted to go there.

Immediately, he transmitted his voice, "If you want to go to the Heavenly Realm, just come along!"

Bringing one more person shouldn't be an issue, and Wu Zuo probably wouldn't object.

Originally, he was prepared to let Gong Miaoyi go. Since she insisted on following, he had to carefully emulate the Ultimate Dao within her body. This would aid in the advancement of his Sword Dao.

In the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard, there was also the Origin Source of the Sword Dao. However, the chess pieces were too powerful, and he couldn't enter the emulation. Devouring them was even more of a fantasy.

Those chess pieces were complete Origin Source Daos, not a strand, nor a thread.

Even though he currently had no desire to devour them, the effects of devouring were still there. Most people truly couldn't resist this temptation.

Before understanding those chess pieces, he wouldn't recklessly devour them. Even if he had the strength to do so, he would still proceed with caution.

In the end, Gong Miaoyi boarded the black-line giant serpent, and the three of them moved in another direction together.

Halfway through, the Black Demon Sea began to tremble.

A tremendous suction force erupted from the underground.

A vortex appeared on the sea surface, similar to the Swirling Sea, but much larger in scale.

The entire Black Demon Sea's water converged towards the vortex, and the sea surface abruptly descended.

Jian Wushuang recalled what the First True King had mentioned‚Äîthree king courts would fall into the temporal turbulence after an hour.

Calculating the time, it was now.

The force of suction drew the Three King Courts into the temporal turbulence, while the others were transported out.

As for Shang and the Universe Master Fuego, their fate remained unknown. After all, they had been inside for 100,000 years. Either they had settled their score through a fierce battle, or they had each left on their own.

Jian Wushuang wasn't particularly curious about that, only wondering whose hands the Soul Dao inheritance had fallen into.

Initially, in the Soul Dao inheritance, Tongtian Buddha and Hu Qing had progressed relatively far.

Perhaps it was one of these two, or maybe it was Zhen Wuyang.

The probability of it being Zhen Wuyang was low since he didn't progress as far as the others.

As for the Transformation Dao, it was almost certain that it fell into Broly's hands.

A group of figures floated in mid-air, feeling somewhat dazed!

The Three King Courts had indeed fallen, and for a moment, they struggled to accept it. They had just been contending within the two great inheritances.

Whew!

Chishui's face darkened.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com
