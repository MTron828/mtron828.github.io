Chapter 1790: Home

Even Jian Wushuang was astonished, let alone He Xiu and Qiu Yue.

“Master, what are we doing here in front of the Spacetime Storm?” He Xiu couldn’t help but ask.

“My hometown is in the Spacetime Storm,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” He Xiu and Qiu Yue were shocked.

In such a terrifying Spacetime Storm, would there be a world where human resided in?

How was it possible?

“Disciple, Qiu Yue,” Jian Wushuang looked at them, “Follow me in later. But after you enter, no matter what you see, do not reveal it to anyone in the future. Otherwise, even though the two of you are close to me, I will definitely kill you.”

“I will obey Master’s order.”

He Xiu and Qiu Yue nodded heavily.

Both of them worshipped and were in awe of Jian Wushuang. Plus, Jian Wushuang had given them a new lease on life. They definitely wouldn’t go against Jian Wushuang’s order.

“Come on, let’s head in.”

Jian Wushuang immediately drove the ancient spaceship towards the Spacetime Storm.

The Spacetime Storm was terrifying but the spaceship was equally barbaric. It hit a hole in the Spacetime Storm forcefully and the spaceship was immersed into the Spacetime Storm.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang spread his soul power and felt the power of the surrounding Spacetime Storm.

“The power is so scary. Luckily, the Spacetime Storm formed a balance long ago. Otherwise… if it were to explode, it could even turn Snow Kingdom into ashes in a split second. Even I do not stand a chance to survive the Spacetime Storm,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

However, due to the existence of the Spacetime Storm, his hometown was never exposed.

On the battlefield where his hometown was located, there shouldn’t be a second person who knew besides King Gu Tong.

The ancient spaceship continued to plunge to the other side of the Spacetime Storm. Just as the spaceship drove past the entire Spacetime Storm, a huge formation appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang saw the formation and he revealed a wide smile.

The formation was created by his Master Xuan Yi. Then, the cultivators in Green Fire Palace and him set it up.

When the formation was first set up, Jian Wushuang could tell the formation was unusual. Then, when he saw it again… he was even more astonished.

The formation was far more sturdy than his had imagined.

Plus, the formation had blended into the Spacetime Storm completely and driven the entire Spacetime Storm. Unless one possessed the power to move the Spacetime Storm, no one could move the formation, not even Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang was one of the people who had set up the formation and he was from Green Fire World. Naturally, the formation wouldn’t hinder him.

Jian Wushuang waved and a bolt of divine power appeared in the huge formation in front of him. The formation suddenly shook and there was a space tunnel that appeared.

Through the space tunnel, Jian Wushuang drove the spaceship and entered the huge battlefield where his hometown was located.

Even after he entered, Palace Master Yun in Green Fire World who had been using the formation to keep watch of experts who entered from outside world didn’t notice at all.

That day, Jian Wushuang, who had left Green Fire World for more than fifty thousand years, returned!

…

It was still the same boundless battlefield.

When the spaceship appeared on the battlefield, Jian Wushuang immediately put the spaceship into Qian Kun ring and he stepped foot into the void.

Jian Wushuang towered in the void as he looked at the surroundings.

The familiar battlefield and the familiar aura made Jian Wushuang take a deep breath.

But suddenly, Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

“That’s not right. The soul aura on the battlefield…”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

He could feel the abundant spiritual energy of the battlefield.

The intensity of spiritual energy was stronger by a hundredfold or even a thousandfold compared to when he had left back then.

So intense. Even Dayu World and Snow Kingdom didn’t have such intense spiritual energy as the battlefield did.

He was guessing that only spiritual energy in the ten sanctuaries would be that intense.

“How could it be?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

The intensity of spiritual energy represented the worth of a cultivation realm.

To cultivate at a place with intense spiritual energy, the effect was naturally better than at other places.

Like Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries in Eternal Chaotic World, the reason why people yearned to visit it was not only because it was highly concentrated with experts but because the spiritual energy was the most intense in the entire Eternal Chaotic World. Hence, its name of cultivation sanctuaries.

But then, on the battlefield where Green Fire World was, the intensity of spiritual energy could barely be compared to favorably with the ten sanctuaries.

“The battlefield should be from ancient times and it is extraordinary. In the tens of thousands of years when I left Green Fire World, the battlefield and Green Fire World definitely went through some incident,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

“Disciple, Qiu Yue, let’s go,” Jian Wushuan beckoned.

He Xiu and Qiu Yue could feel the spiritual energy that the battlefield contained as well and they were amazed but they didn’t ask any questions.

They heard Jian Wushuang and they followed Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang knew which part of the battlefield he had landed on and he knew where Green Fire Palace was. He didn’t delay any further but walked to Green Fire Palace.

Soon, he arrived at Green Fire Palace, in front of the huge war fortress. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The huge war fortress was covered in layers of formation. The formations carried power to a certain extent. It was at least a few times stronger than the formation that Jian Wushuang had set up before he left.

Any layer of the formations could hinder an ordinary Universe God.

When Green Fire Palace had had a war with Jin Kingdom fifty-thousand years ago, Green Fire Palace had had ve such a huge formation, there had been no need for them to pay such a great price to defeat Jin Kingdom,

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and overlooked the war fortress. He swept out his soul power and covered the entire war fortress.

Although the war fortress could hinder ordinary Universe Gods, it was merely nominal to Jian Wushuang. His soul power could see through the internals of the war fortress clearly.

The auras were in the war fortress.

Jian Wushuang saw a few auras that he was familiar with and he was thrilled.

However, the few auras were much stronger than before.

“Haha, it seems that in the tens of thousands of years when I was away, Green Fire Palace has been through drastic changes. The overall power has increased tremendously.”

Jian Wushuang felt the auras below and revealed a smile.
