“Jian Wushuang, go in and have a look.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“Fine.”

That was just what he wanted. He instantly entered the scarlet tower.

However, he did not see any treasure at first glance. What he saw were the lists of treasures floating in the Void.

On these lists, treasures were divided into different categories.

For example, magic weapons, Secret Skills, elixirs, Natural Treasures, and special treasures…

“The Priceless Treasure Vault can not only judge the value of treasures but also know how to classify them voluntarily?”?Jian Wushuang thought with a smile and looked at the magic weapons first.

There were countless high-grade magic weapons, including knives, spear, clubs and other kinds.?The worst ones were Emperor Weapons, top-grade Emperor Weapons!

“Top-grade Emperor Weapons are fantastic in the Green Fire World and can stir a fever of enthusiasm among many Dao Masters. However, in the Green Fire Palace, they are the worst ones. 10 Fire Points are sufficient to exchange them!”?Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly.

More than 90% of magic weapons here were Emperor Weapons with all sorts of strange kinds, for example, wings, fans, and copper bells that had special functions. Apparently, those with special functions were more precious.

The Chaos Magic Weapons were better than the Emperor Weapons. The most valuable magic weapon here was a cyan sickle, a Chaos Magic Treasure!

Magic weapons had four grades in total, namely, the Emperor Weapon Level, the Chaos Magic Weapon Level, the Chaos Magic Treasure Level, and the Chaos Divine Treasure Level.

Jian Wushuang’s Blood-killing Plate Armor was a Chaos Magic Treasure and his Mountain River Map was a Chaos Divine Treasure!

“Good gracious! There is a Chaos Magic Treasure in the Green Fire Palace.”?Gu King’s voice carried a touch of shock. ”?This is a Chaos Magic Treasure! Although it is of the lowest grade and is way worse than your Blood-killing Plate Armor, it would attract many experts to contend for it even if it were in the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“It must be a treasure that experts from the Green Fire Palace attained from the battlefield. The Green Fire World itself can never possess such a treasure.”?Jian Wushuang said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Well, that’s possible.”?Gu King nodded.?“Don’t look at the magic weapons anymore. Go and have a look at the Secret Skills.”

Jian Wushuang immediately cast his eye over the Secret Skills.

The Fire Point Exchange Office owned quite a few Secret Skills that were of fairly high grades.

“Good lord, although I don’t value most of the Secret Skills here, I have to admit that there are more than 10 fabulous Secret Skills. Each one of them can tempt experts like Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master to fight for it even if it were in the Eternal Chaotic World. Nevertheless, there are more than 10 such Secret Skills in the Green Fire World. Your world indeed abounds with gifts of nature.”?Gu King gasped in admiration.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded. He could tell that these Secret Skills were out of the ordinary.

If someone put these Secret Skills in the Green Fire World, numerous experts would be crazy about it.

However, they were only available to experts in the Green Fire Palace and could not be imparted to others without authorization.

“But it’s a pity that although these Secret Skills are amazing, the threshold for cultivating them is too high. I guess few people in the Green Fire World are able to cultivate them. Even if they cultivate them forcibly, they will pay a great price.”?Gu King added.

“All right, let’s drop the subject. Can you help me to see if there are any Secret Skills that are useful to me?”?asked Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry, I’m already doing that for you.”?Gu King had already glanced over these Secret Skills and he gained a result in a short moment.

“The Secret Skills here are extraordinary and you are in need of a lot of them. But there is only one Secret Skill that named Golden Image is very useful to you. You are able to cultivate it and afford it with your Fire Points.”

“Golden Image Secret Skill?”?Jian Wushuang immediately searched for it and soon discovered the introduction to it.

“Protective Secret Skill?”?Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

He had cultivated one Protective Secret Skill from the Rock Demon Clan. It was the Immortality Secret Skill created by God Hong.

The Immortality Secret Skill had a good enough impact on him previously. Now, however, as his strength improved day by day, especially after he had the Blood-killing Plate Armor to protect him, it had no effect on him anymore.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve considered everything for you!”

Gu King stated, “You are a Three-star Imperial God and your physical body is very strong. Because of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, you can even try to resist a blow from an elementary or medium Celestial Master. If an advanced Celestial Master attacks you, he is able to injure you severely. And if a Celestial Master at the Exceptional Realm strikes you, you definitely will die.”

“As a result, you badly need a powerful Protective Secret Skill to toughen your body currently. Although the Golden Image Secret Skill cannot be classified into the advanced Secret Skills in the Eternal Chaotic World, it’s good enough for you. It has three stages in total. You are required to succeed in cultivating the first stage. At that time, only a few Celestial Masters are able to kill you if you coordinate it with the Blood-killing Plate Armor.”

“Oh?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He was well aware that of the many skills a man possessed, the most important of which was the skill to save his life.

Only when that skill was powerful enough could he live longer. Therefore, the Golden Image Secret Skill was essential to him.

“10,000 Fire Points?”?Jian Wushuang was speechless as he looked at the price for the Golden Image Secret Skill.

A Peak Emperor Weapon only cost 10 Fire Points, but the Fire Points the Golden Image Secret Skill cost could buy 1,000 such Emperor Weapons.

“I don’t have any Fire Points right now and don’t know how to acquire them. I’d better inquire Celestial Master Yu Ding about it later.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

“Jian Wushuang, look at the special treasures.”?Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“Hmm.”?Jian Wushuang immediately cast his eye over them.

There were all kinds of treasures of different shapes and functions in this type. They directly dazzled Jian Wushuang.

Gu King exclaimed as he observed those treasures.

“Gu King, what’s wrong?”?Jian Wushuang asked.

“Haha, nothing, I just saw a few nice gadgets, and as I expected, this is a lowest-grade Priceless Treasure Vault that cannot estimate the real value and functions of these treasures. So, the prices for them are very low.”?Gu King laughed.

“Oh?”?Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Just at this point…

“What?”?Gu King suddenly cried out in surprise.

“What happened?”?Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“Jian Wushuang, I discovered a nice thing!”?Gu King said smilingly.
