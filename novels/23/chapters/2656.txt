Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang walked toward the Sacred Heaven Road without hesitation. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He soon set foot on the first step of the Sacred Heaven Road.

Jian Wushuang immediately sensed a decent oppressive force on him as soon as he arrived at the first step.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. “Is this all? No, it shouldn’t be that simple.”

Jian Wushuang did not stop and continued walking up step-by-step.

The oppressive force on him was getting stronger as he gradually progressed up those steps.

However, the oppressive force did not affect Jian Wushuang at all nor did it slow down his pace.

The Sacred Heaven Road had 1,000 steps in total. Jian Wushuang soon arrived on the 99th step and when he stepped on the 100th step...

Hum!

The world surrounding Jian Wushuang began to change as he soon arrived in a vast limitless dark void with a tall figure standing before him while solemnly staring at him.

“You have to stay with me for ten breaths before you can move on.” A cold voice came from the tall figure.

“Consciousness Space?” Jian Wushuang was surprised as a smile spread on his face.

Jian Wushuang was on the 100th step only for a brief moment before he continued to step toward the 101st step.

The Consciousness Space test was based on one’s cultivation realm, hence the test was set at a similar level for Jian Wushuang was only a High-level Earth Ultimate God and allowed him to pass without much difficulty.

He was moving all the way up at a very fast pace.

In just a few moments, he had already arrived on the 700th step without even slowing down.

There were still many young cultivators who were walking upward with difficulty on the Sacred Heaven Road. The region between 700th and 900th steps had dozens of young cultivators with most of them stuck on their own steps as the difficulty drastically increased upon every step upward.

On the 750th step, a dark-skinned young man wrapped in animal skins was standing there trembling under the huge oppressive force on his body but gritted his teeth and endured it.

“The seven-hundred-fiftieth step is already my limit. I can only try to adapt slowly and find a way to set foot on the seven-hundred-fifty-first step!” The young man wrapped in animal skins grunted in a low voice.

Suddenly, whoosh!

A figure appeared beside him.

The young man wrapped in animal skins immediately turned his head to look.

“I haven’t seen this person before. When did he arrive behind me?” The young man wrapped in animal skins was puzzled but could see that man did not even stop as he continued stepping onto the seven-hundred-fifty-first step before continuing to step onto the seven hundred fifty-second step.

The young man wrapped in animal skins was taken aback. “What? The oppressive force is already very terrifying at the seven-hundred-fiftieth steps. His speed would have been forced to slow down no matter how good a cultivator is, but he was still advancing fast. It seems...as though he’s unaffected by the oppressive force at all?”

Many other young cultivators on the Sacred Heaven Road had also noticed the existence of the cold and proud man in the black robe other than him. He was none other than Jian Wushuang.

“Look, look at that person!”

“He’s so fast. He has already reached the seven-hundred-ninetieth steps, but is still advancing fast?”

“The eight-hundredth step!”

Everyone held their breath as they watched him.

Every 100th step on the Sacred Heaven Road had a test in the Consciousness Space. The test was very difficult with many geniuses unable to pass the 800th step test with most needing to be stuck on it for a long time even if they were able to pass.

Jian Wushuang merely stopped briefly before continuing to step forward onto the 801st step to everyone’s surprise after reaching the 800th step.

“How’s this possible?”

“This is impossible!”

Many cultivators on the Sacred Heaven Road were in disbelief.

“The 800th step Consciousness Space test did not even stop that person’s speed?”

“What’s going on?”

It basically meant that he only needed less than ten breaths to survive in the Consciousness Space test and probably had instantaneously defeated his opponent.

They could sense that person’s divine power breath at the High-level Earth Ultimate God. It would not come as no surprise for a High-level Earth Ultimate God to go up against an opponent at the Peak Earth Ultimate God on the 800th step.

However, that man had instantly defeated his opponent.

In other words, his true combat strength was definitely higher and perhaps might have reached the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm despite being only a High-level Earth Ultimate God. He must be quite strong even among Peak Earth Ultimate Gods!

He was capable of challenging higher realm cultivators!

The man turned out to be an expert in challenging cultivators stronger than himself!

The man did not slow down at all after passing the 800th step. The increasing oppressive pressure force seemed to not affect him at all as he continued to climb at an extremely fast pace.

He soon reached the 850th, 880th, and 900th step!

At the 900th step, he was once again caught in the Consciousness Space test that was even more difficult than the previous.

The result...was the same nonetheless.

The man only paused for a brief moment before continuing onto the 901st step.

“This...”

Many young cultivators on the Sacred Heaven Road were completely stunned.

They could not believe what they saw.

Jian Wushuang continued to move upward with ease under their incomprehensible gazes and in just a jiffy stepped on the last step—the 1,000th step.

Even on the very last step, he was not bothered by the hindrances and had easily crossed over—finally reaching the top-end of Sacred Heaven Road.

“He got to the top?”

“Did he just effortlessly climb to the top of Sacred Heaven Road?”

“I feel like he’s just sauntering and unaffected by the tests.”

“Who’s this person?”

Many young cultivators still struggling on the steps looked up at Jian Wushuang who had already reached the mountain top with widened eyes.

At the mountain top, Jian Wushuang looked at the densely arranged attics and palaces before him with a weird smile on his face.

‘I’ve been rather high profile by so effortlessly climbing up the mountain. It’s impossible to not catch the attention of Sacred Heaven Palace’s experts, but I’m unsure if I’ve caught the Palace Master’s?’ Jian Wushuang secretly thought.
