Chapter 3673: Questions

“Who is that man? He is on the same level as Lord White Emperor?”

“His name is Jian Wushuang. It is said that he was from tens of millions of years ago, and his strength does not seem to be weaker than Lord White Emperor’s.”

“His strength is not weaker than Lord White Emperor’s?”

“Are you kidding me? Lord White Emperor is an extraordinary figure who has been left behind since the first era. In the entire Eternal Chaotic World, apart from those ancient experts who have been sleeping, who else could be a match for Lord White Emperor?”

“I don’t know, but since Jian Wushuang can stand on the same level as Lord White Emperor, it means that he must have some strength.”

The discussions and whispers echoed in the hall.

White Emperor looked around and heard the conversations of many people. He could not help but smile. “Jian Wushuang, you disappeared for tens of millions of years. These tens of millions of years just happened to be the time when the number of experts in the Eternal Chaotic World exploded. There are many new experts who don’t know about you now.”

“It doesn’t matter. I won’t stay in the Eternal Chaotic World for long this time. It doesn’t matter whether these little guys know about me or not.” Jian Wushuang was very calm. “White Emperor, tell them to be quiet. I have something to say.”

Originally, Jian Wushuang only needed to show some divine power to easily suppress the cultivators present and make them tremble. However, Jian Wushuang felt that it was unnecessary, so it was better to let White Emperor speak.

“Everyone, please stop.”

As expected, as soon as the White Emperor opened his mouth, these discussions immediately stopped.

The hundreds of experts present all looked at the White Emperor and Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, speak.” The White Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Everyone, many of you know me to a certain extent, but there are also many who don’t know who I am. But it doesn’t matter. This time, I came back to tell you some things. After that, I will leave.” Jian Wushuang paused, he continued, “What I want to tell you is related to the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“As we all know, the Eternal Chaotic World has existed for three eras, namely the ancient era, the first era, and now the second era. Among them, the ancient era is the most glorious. Even now, there are many sleeping experts of the ancient era in the Eternal Chaotic World. Those experts of the ancient era are all extremely powerful, far beyond the level of the ‘Ruler’ that you all know.”

“But why were the experts of the ancient times so powerful?”

“Actually, it’s very simple. It’s because the cultivators of the ancient times were from another world. And that world is a world that is far more vast and vast than the Eternal Chaotic World. The experts are as numerous as the clouds, far beyond what the Eternal Chaotic World can compare to.”

“For example, the strongest cultivator in the Eternal Chaotic World is now recognized as an ‘Ruler’. In that world, they are called the Chaos Realm. In that world, the Chaos Realm is just an insignificant figure, or even an ant. Above the Chaos Realm, there are Divine Demon Realm, Divine Master Realm, and Saint Realm!”

“After reaching the Saint Realm, in some barren places in that world, you can barely be considered an expert. But in the core of that world, you are still just an ant.”

Jian Wushuang said a lot in one breath.

Hearing his words, most of the hundreds of cultivators present were stunned, and many of them were in disbelief.

“Mr. Jian Wushuang, is what you just said true? Is there an even wider world outside the Eternal Chaotic World?

“You have disappeared for tens of millions of years. Could it be that you have gone to that wider world?”

“a Ruler is an ant? Even a Saint Realm expert who is far beyond the Ruler realm is an ant in some core places. How is that possible? Jian Wushuang, are you kidding?”

What Jian Wushuang said was indeed a little too shocking for the cultivators in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Because of the shock, it caused a lot of doubts. Some people even directly refuted, and their words were somewhat unkind.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. “Shut up!”

With a low shout, the time and space in the palace instantly froze.

Except for those who were friends with Jian Wushuang, the other Rulers on the thrones immediately found that they could not move their bodies at all, they could not open their mouths anymore and could not say a word.

They could only stare with their eyes wide open in terror.

“How noisy.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold.

The Eternal Chaotic World was his hometown, and he did have great feelings for it. He was also close to the cultivators here, but that did not mean that they could question or provoke him. After all…he was an expert at the Ruler level.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, even a Principles Master who dared to challenge the authority of a Ruler would die, let alone a mere Chaos Realm expert. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Listen up. I don’t have the time or the need to answer your questions. I’m willing to tell you all this because you were born in the Eternal Chaotic World. Just listen to me obediently. As for whether you believe me or not, it’s up to you.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand, immediately, the stagnant space-time in the hall began to flow again.

Only those cultivators who were stuck in the space-time stagnation could move again.

However, even though they could move again, the cultivators were still extremely terrified.

They did not know what method Jian Wushuang had used just now, but at that moment, they could not move at all and could only be butchered by others. It made them feel terrified from the bottom of their hearts. With this move…Jian Wushuang had already proved his terrifying strength.

His strength was definitely far beyond that of the White Emperor.

Immediately, the doubts of the cultivators toward Jian Wushuang disappeared, leaving only fear and awe.

They listened to what Jian Wushuang said and did not dare to refute him.

“I just said that there is an even wider world outside the Eternal Chaotic World. Actually, it’s not all like this because the Eternal Chaotic World and that world are originally one. However, due to some special reasons, the Eternal Chaotic World is completely isolated...”

Jian Wushuang immediately described the origin of the Eternal Chaotic World, its relationship with the Divine Beginning Realm, and the location of the seal formation in more detail.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, hundreds of cultivators present, including White Emperor, who was sitting next to Jian Wushuang, were shocked.
