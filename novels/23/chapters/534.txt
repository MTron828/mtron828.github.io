Chapter 535: Rescue

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In Zone No. 14, a large breach, through which two Demonic Beasts were able to enter simultaneously, appeared in the Formation and an endless Demonic Beasts were swarming into the Formation. Thousands of Demonic Beast had already entered.

The sergeants of the Sixth Army, who were guarding this breach, were struggling to stop the Demonic Beasts. However, they had suffered heavy losses and only one-third of the Army remained to continue fighting.

When the sergeants of the Seventh Army arrived, they were shocked to see the terrible swarm of Demonic Beasts in front of them.

“So many Demonic Beasts,” Fang Han observed with a serious expression before turning to face Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, we’re counting on you.”

“Leave it to me,” Jian Wushuang replied seriously and then stepped forward.

Hum... A vast Blood River spread out at an alarming rate and covered the entire battlefield in an instant.

The powerful Realm oppressed the weaker Demonic Beasts, forcing them to fall directly to the ground. Even the stronger Demonic Beasts were still greatly restrained.

“Kill them!” Fang Han commanded in a low voice. The sergeants of the Seventh Army immediately pounced on the Demonic Beasts fiercely.

“Haha, brothers, our reinforcements are coming. Let’s kill those damn Demonic Beasts!” the commander of the Sixth Army shouted. They immediately cooperated to fight against the Demonic Beasts.

Jian Wushuang controlled the Realm and rushed onto the battlefield at the same time.

Whoosh... Dazzling sword light lit up and glided past the Demonic Beasts with ease.

The sword light was so bright and fast that even the Rank Seven Monsters could not parry it. Only a Rank Eight Monster could block one or two sword moves. However, few Demonic Beasts were of Rank Eight.

Ruthless slaughter!

Jian Wushuang slaughtered the Demonic Beasts mercilessly throughout the battlefield, leaving their bodies lying all over. The battlefield became a hell for the Demonic Beasts.

In the face of crisis, Jian Wushuang did not hide his strength. He tried his best to kill as many Demonic Beasts as possible.

After all, the Human Territory was directly behind them. If these Demonic Beasts really broke through and entered the Human Territory, the consequence would be unimaginable.

“Die!”

A gleam of killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as his sword light glided past a Rank Eight Monster’s throat, making it directly fall to the ground, dead.

“Amazing!”

“Who’s that squad leader? He’s so strong!”

“Oh, my god. He killed a Rank Eight Monster with only three sword moves!”

Seeing how Jian Wushuang slaughtered the Demonic Beasts, even the human sergeants were stunned.

Jian Wushuang was definitely much stronger than the commanders who were top Second-grade Divine Generals.

The commander of the Sixth Army and Fang Han, the commander of the Seventh Army, who were both top Second-grade Divine Generals, were definitely unable to kill the Demonic Beasts as easily as Jian Wushuang did.

“Haha, he’s the leader of the tenth squad, Jian Wushuang!”

“He’s our squad leader.”

“Look, this is our leader. The Realm is also formed by him.”

Everyone in the tenth squad was proud of him.

These sergeants marveled at his strength and felt pleased. With such an extraordinary expert in their camp, who possessed such a powerful Realm Technique, they had no fear of the Demonic Beasts.

The moral of these human sergeants increased immediately!

Only one man became gloomy.

Jin Ling.

Jin Ling was also a member of the Seventh Army that came to the battlefield with Jian Wushuang. He had killed lots of Demonic Beasts and obtained quite a number of Monster Cores. However, it seemed to be nothing compared with what Jian Wushuang did.

“This guy,” Jin Ling stared at Jian Wushuang coldly, his eyes filled with resentment.

When the fighting broke out in Zone No. 14, the battle at the front of the Sky Fire Plains was dozens of times more intense.

At least 100 thousand Demonic Beasts, led by many Rank Eight Monsters and even some Rank Nine Monsters, crazily assaulted the humans. All the human generals had taken action and tried their best to resist.

At the rear of the Monster Army, the small human-like young man stood on the head of a tall Demonic Beast, constantly giving out orders.

“Haha, boys, let’s go kill them! The more the better.”

The young man’s eyes were scarlet and his face was full of excitement.

A Demonic Beast, with a human body and a leopard head, walked towards the young man.

“Sir,” the leopard-head Demonic Beast said in human language, “We created a large breach in Zone No. 14 of the human camp, and thousands of our clansmen rushed into the Formation. More clansmen would have been able to rush into the breach if only we had not been blocked by their reinforcements.”

“Oh?” The young man changed his expression slightly, then immediately asked, “How large is the breach?”

“Wide enough for two clansmen to enter at the same time,” the leopard-head Demonic Beast replied.

“Haha,” The young man immediately laughed. “It’s enough for thousands of Demonic Beasts to swarm into in only half an hour.”

“Mo Wu,” the young man spoke. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Sir,” an ugly Demonic Beast, whose body was covered in dark purple scales, immediately walked to him.

“Lead your clansmen to Zone No. 14 of human camp. Defeat them so that more Demonic Beasts can enter the Human Territory.”

“Yes, sir.” That Demonic Beast replied and then immediately rushed away.

Many Demonic Beasts left with him, including over 20 Rank Eight Monsters and over 100 Rank Seven Monsters, as well as thousands of Demonic Beast that were under Rank Seven.

They immediately rushed towards Zone No. 14 of human camp.

At this time, the battle in Zone No. 14 had gradually stabilized.

Assisted by Jian Wushuang’s Realm and inspired by his bravery and slaughter, the sergeants of the Sixth Army and the Seventh Army were able to display their full strength. The human camp gradually took the upper hand.

“Now I need to find a way to block that large breach,”?Jian Wushuang thought.
