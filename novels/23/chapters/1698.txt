Chapter 1699: A Man In A Responsible Position

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Comparing backgrounds, the Soaring Heaven King Palace was a lot more powerful than the Lineage of Star.

In terms of abilities, be it the number of Almighties who were part of the higher-ups or the number of Real Gods, the Soaring Heaven King Palace had the Lineage of Star beaten in both areas.

As for their positions in the Sanctuary Alliance, the Soaring Heaven King Palace was at a much higher position than the Lineage of Star and this could be seen during the distribution of the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy every thirty years.

During every distribution, the Lineage of Star could only get one Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy while the Soaring Heaven King Palace could get two of them.

Since the Soaring Heaven King Palace was better than the Lineage of Star in every area, they could start a war with the Lineage of Star right away.

However, in the end… the Soaring Heaven King Palace Master’s orders were imposing at the start as he said that they would kill anyone who dared to stop them from killing Jian Wushuang. Indeed, they were also daring enough to kill the experts of the Lineage of Star. However, from the start to the end, they only focused on one expert in the Lineage of Star and they had never threatened the Lineage of Star for real.

At that moment, they had suffered huge losses. Not only did they lose many experts, they had also lost many treasures. The most important thing was that they had lost a great amount of their prestige!

According to the way that the Soaring Heaven King Palace had always done their things, they should have started a war with the Lineage of Star immediately.

However, in actual fact, the Soaring Heaven King Palace did not do it.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Hall Master Yuan and the two other Hall Masters looked at one another and laughed at once.

“Jian Wushuang, since you are already one of the Hall Masters, I can tell you some of the secrets of the Lineage of Star.” Hall Master Yuan laughed. “That’s right. The Soaring Heaven King Palace is powerful. Their abilities as a whole and their background are a lot stronger than the Lineage of Star. However, even if more guts were loaned to them, they would still not dare to start a war with the Lineage of Star for real!”

“From the day the Lineage of Star is founded to now, over so many years, the Lineage of Star has only fought a war against a big powerhouse for real at the start. Although that big powerhouse was inferior to the Soaring Heaven King Palace, it was not different from them by too much. However, the Lineage of Star scored a complete victory during that battle. Ever since then, all the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance have dared not start a war with the Lineage of Star for real. As for the reason? You can make a guess.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. However, his eyes glowed with a shrill light abruptly, “Could it be because of the Secret Skill of Star Palace?”

“Haha, that’s right. It’s the Secret Skill of Star Palace.” Hall Master Yuan laughed, “You also know that the Lineage of Star has Four Secret Skills. However, the most popular Secret Skill that caused experts from everywhere in the Eternal Chaotic World to be fearful is the Secret Skill of Star Palace. This Secret Skill is really frightening.”

Jian Wushuang had a puzzled expression.

He was clear that the Secret Skill of Star Palace was actually the Secret Skill of Seven Star from the Seven Star Black Sect. Hence, it was a Secret Skill from the Ancient Past and it ought to be frightening.

“Jian Wushuang, you have cultivated the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Thus, you do not need me to explain how powerful it is. As for our Palace Master, he has also cultivated the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace. When the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace is fully activated, his abilities will rise by a hundred times straight away and this will be maintained for a breath’s time.”

“Moreover, our Palace Master is an Emperor God. Furthermore, he is a well-known person among the Emperor Gods. With such abilities, if he were to unleash the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace as well, what level do you think our Palace Master would reach?” Hall Master Yuan looked over with interest.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He was already a well-known person among the Emperor Gods. If he were to activate the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace as well, his abilities…

“Great Emperor level?” Jian Wushuang said with surprise.

“That’s right. It’s Great Emperor level.” Hall Master Yuan laughed, “During the great battle between the Lineage of Star and the big powerhouse back then, it became a one-sided suppression as the Palace Master unleashed the Secret Skill of Star Palace at the very start. As such, he killed three Almighties which included one Emperor God of that big powerhouse with lightning speed. Therefore, how could that big powerhouse not be defeated?”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang became shocked as he listened.

He finally understood why the Soaring Heaven King Palace dared not start a war with the Lineage of Star.

It was because of the Star Palace Master being a great deterrent.

After all, although it was only for a breath’s time, he possessed Great Emperor level fighting capabilities. Moreover, when the Secret Skill of Star Palace was used, one had to wait for a period of time before being able to use it again. However, the fighting capabilities that could only last for a breath’s time were enough to strike the Soaring Heaven King Palace with terror.

As such, the Soaring Heaven King Palace dared to take the initiative to kill the experts of the Lineage of Star and they even dared to kill the top geniuses of the Lineage of Star.

However, as for starting a great battle with the Lineage of Star, in particular, a great battle where they would fight to their last breath, they did not have the courage to do so as they were frightened.

“Palace Master… A man in a responsible position,” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

“He is indeed a man in a responsible position. With the Palace Master keeping watch, the Lineage of Star also has a high position in the Sanctuary Alliance. Even though we have provoked some strong enemies and powerhouses, no one among them can do anything to the Lineage of Star. For example, many powerhouses were envious of us because of the priceless White Blaze Fruit tree that you obtained back then. However, no one dared to cast their greedy eyes on it. Although that was mostly due to the Purple Moon Great Emperor, those powerhouses were also quite fearful of our Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Previously, he had not known much about the Star Palace Master. He only knew that the Star Palace Master was an Emperor God with strong abilities and he had founded the Lineage of Star. Moreover, he was fortunate to obtain the ‘Secret Skill of Seven Star’ of the Seven Star Black Sect. However, Jian Wushuang did not know how important the Star Palace Master was in the Lineage of Star.

“It is fortunate for the Lineage of Star to have such a super expert keeping watch. However, everything has its pros and cons,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

To a sect, it was indeed good for them to have a man in a responsible position. However, if the man in a responsible position did not have some experts who could bear some heavy responsibilities beside him, it would definitely be a disaster for the sect if the man in a responsible position were to fall. It would be even more of a disaster especially if the sect possessed treasures that could catch the greedy eyes of many people and had also offended quite a number of experts from other powerhouses.

“Oh right. Jian Wushuang, there’s something that I am very curious about.” Hall Master Nie Yun questioned abruptly: “By using Real God Han Quan to threaten the Soaring Heaven King Palace, you obtained many benefits from them. In particular, I understand why you got one hundred thousand Doctrine Gems and five hundred years of training time in the Fairy Palace. After all, you need them. However, as for the Demon Cores… why do you need so many Demon Cores?”

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin also looked over.

They were curious as well. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang laughed at once, “To tell you the truth, I wanted those Demon Cores so that I could absorb the pure power within them to make my Divine Power more powerful. An Inverse Cultivator like me is very different from a normal cultivator. At the level of a Real God, the thickness of Divine Power is extremely important to me as it is the key to me making a breakthrough. However, relying on myself to train continuously and accumulate Divine Power is too slow. If I were to absorb Demon Cores, I could accumulate Divine Power a lot faster.”

“Is that so?” the three Hall Masters understood at once.

“If it’s Demon Cores, the Lineage of Star will have quite a number of them. Do you have enough Demon Cores on your hands now? If you do not have enough, I can give you some right away,” Hall Master Yuan said.
