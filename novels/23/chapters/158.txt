Chapter 159: Three Strips

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A whip?” Jian Wushuang queerly smiled.

Whoosh! The demonic and seductive figure of Ling Xue’er instantly moved.

Like a glamorous viper, Ling Xue’er appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, flicking out the aquamarine long whip. At that time, many streaks of the waves were rolling without cessation. Jian Wushuang felt that he was sucked down by the whirlpool and the boundless seawater was squeezed toward him.

“With this level of strength, you are qualified to be ranked 8th on the Earthly Dragon List.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and then struck out with the Triple-kill Sword. Fiery Wind Sword Essence suddenly rushed forward, forming a fiery wind dragon which seemed to burn and tear up everything.

In an instant, that endless wave was frantically scattered around with overwhelming strength.

“What?” Ling Xue’er was shocked.

Previously, when she witnessed Jian Wushuang fighting with Xue Yun on the platform, she could tell that Jian Wushuang was strong, but she didn’t know how strong. After all, she did not personally experience the power of Jian Wushuang’s sword.

But now, she was experiencing it.

“It’s too strong. If I fight with him in close combat, I will instantly be defeated.”Although Ling Xue’er was shocked, she looked calm.

When Jian Wushuang was stabbing towards her with his long sword, her figure began to retreat, with a streak of cold light flashing in her eyes.

“Go to hell!”

Ling Xue’er roared, then three streaks of flowing light pierced the air and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang at an astonishing speed.

“Concealed weapons?”?the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth were quirked up,“Too easy.”

A burst of Sword Essence of Earth rushed out from Jian Wushuang’s sword, easily parrying the three streaks of flowing light. While the streaks were falling down, Jian Wushuang recognized that they were three tiny willow leaf knives covered with a greenish-black liquid.

Obviously, that was poison!

“You are vicious, it’s indeed correct to call you Demon Girl.” Jian Wushuang and his sword shadow suddenly rushed forward.

Ling Xue’er could only try her best to brandish her long whip and parry it. However, Jian Wushuang’s sword strikes were too fast and powerful.

Six moves were displayed in succession, and all of them were extremely powerful.

After the six moves, Ling Xue’er’s hands were trembling and numb. Her face was pale and her figure was quickly retreating.

“Ling Xue’er, if you get in my way?again, I guarantee that you will not see the sun tomorrow.” Jian Wushuang looked at Ling Xue’er with cold eyes.

Ling Xue’er was ranked eighth on the Earthly Dragon List. Killing her would take a little time.

Ling Xue’er’s expression became gloomy. Although she was furious, now was not the time to show it.

But at that moment…

“Ah!”

Suddenly, there was a loud scream.

Jian Wushuang and Ling Xue’er immediately looked in the direction of the scream. Both of their expressions immediately changed.

They saw the Demonic Cloud Leopard standing on the ground with a corpse lying in front of it. The head, separated from the body, was in the mouth of the Demonic Cloud Leopard. With a fierce chomp, the head was instantly crushed.

“What?”

“What happened?”

Both Jian Wushuang and Ling Xue’er were shocked.

When they were fighting, the remaining three people began attacking the Demonic Cloud Leopard. They were all experts on the Earthly Dragon List, ranging from the 30th to the 40th rank on the list. Logically speaking, any one of them could defeat a beast in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It was more than enough to kill a Demonic Cloud Leopard if they worked together.

But instead, it was the Demonic Cloud Leopard that killed someone.

“This Demonic Cloud Leopard?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Demonic Cloud Leopard again, this time in astonishment. He was surprised to see that there were three purple cloud?stripes on its abdomen.

“Three stripes?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“A three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard?” Ling Xue’er was also shocked.

Demonic Cloud Leopards, a kind of senior spirit beast, were rare in Tianzong Dynasty, and most of them were in the Gold Core Realm. As for the Demonic Cloud Leopards in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, it was estimated that only one or two existed in the whole Tianzong Dynasty.

Demonic Cloud Leopards had three levels.

The levels were based on the number of purple cloud stripes on their abdomen.

The most normal Demonic Cloud Leopard had only one purple cloud stripe.

A Demonic Cloud Leopard with two purple cloud stripes was very rare.

As for three purple cloud stripes, it might not be possible to find one in a hundred Demonic Cloud Leopards.

There was a huge discrepancy in the strength of Demonic Cloud Leopards at each level.

For a Demonic Cloud Leopard in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, if it had one stripe, it was comparable to the most common experts in the Initial Yin Void Realm. a Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard could absolutely be compared to an expert at the peak of the Initial Yin Void Realm. Maybe even an expert in the Profound Yin Void Realm.

When they arrived, they assumed the Demonic Cloud Leopard was only a normal Demonic Cloud Leopard with one stripe. No one had paid attention. Now, they realized it was a big mistake.

“I thought the 15 spirit beasts in the Cloud Mountain range were common spirit beasts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. Apparently, I was wrong. Among the 15 beasts, there are some powerful and terrifying spirit beasts, such as the three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

After they discovered the Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard, a large number of experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm gathered in the air above the Cloud mountain range, overlooking everything below.

They could see everything that happened in the Cloud mountain range from their position.

“Haha, these fellows really thought those 15 spirit beasts would be easily defeated?”

“They underestimated the cruelty of this selection battle!”

“It seems like all 15 spirit beasts are only in the normal Yin-Yang Void Realm, but three of them are unique spirit beasts with strength that is close to the Profound Yin Void Realm. They are hard to deal with. This Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard is only the first one.”

“There are two other spirit beasts that are close to the Profound Yin Void Realm, and they will soon come across these little fellows.”

“How unfortunate for these little fellows.”

The experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm were casually talking.

on the mountaintop, Jian Wushuang’s expression had become cold. However, the gazes of Ling Xue’er and other two Earthly Dragon List experts were filled with fear after seeing this Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard.

“The Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard is in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. Even if I could fight it with my full strength, I’m afraid that I could not kill it.”?Squinting her eyes, Ling Xue’er immediately made a decision and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you wanted me to get out of the way right? So, I’ll leave. This Demonic Cloud Leopard is yours. I hope you will cherish it and take good care of it...”

After that, Ling Xue’er turned around without hesitation and left.
