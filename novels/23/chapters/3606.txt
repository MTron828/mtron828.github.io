“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and bowed solemnly, “Thank you!”

After knowing everything, Jian Wushuang knew that he had received a great favor from the people in front of him.

Jian Wushuang had to hurry up and remember this favor.

“Haha, little guy, you don’t have to thank us. After all, we are helping ourselves and the entire Divine Beginning Realm. Although the Divine Beginning Realm has reached the middle stage due to the accelerated evolution of the Star Master, as long as you can take it back, the Divine Beginning Realm can still be saved,” Daoist Xuan Shen said seriously.

“Moreover, it’s different from the last battle. Our Divine Beginning Realm’s foundation was too weak, and the arrival of the Devil Cloud Star Master and his subordinates was too sudden. As a result, we didn’t have much power to resist. However, it’s different this time.”

“From the end of that battle until now, a long, long time has passed. Even I can’t remember how long it has been. And from the end of that battle, we’ve started to make plans for today. We’ve been preparing and waiting for the right time!”

“Even now, the power we have in our hands is still not comparable to Devil Cloud Star, let alone fighting him head-on. But...if Devil Cloud Star Master comes again, our Divine Beginning Realm will not be powerless to resist. We are even confident that we can protect ourselves!”

“Protect ourselves?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He did not expect that even after preparing for so many years, Daoist Xuan Shen and the others could only barely protect themselves.

“It’s already good enough that we can barely protect ourselves. At least this time, we won’t be completely defeated. As long as we can protect ourselves, we will be able to counterattack. For us, the biggest counterattack is nothing more than breaking through to the Ruler Realm and then...taking over the Divine Beginning Realm again!” Daoist Xuan Shen’s voice was solemn.

“Once you take over the Divine Beginning Realm again, the Divine Beginning Realm will be under your control. At that time, as long as the experts from the outside world enter the Divine Beginning Realm, you can try your best to suppress their strength to an extremely low level. On the other hand, you can choose not to suppress the local experts like us. Under this situation, the people from Devil Cloud Star will not dare to step into our Divine Beginning Realm again!”

“Yes, as long as you can take back the Divine Beginning Realm, we will win this battle!” Temporal Temple Master nodded heavily.

“That’s true. However, if I want to take back the Divine Beginning Realm, I have to be at least at the level of a Ruler. But now, I’m far from the Ruler Realm.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

A Ruler had to completely comprehend the four principles, and he had to completely fuse the four principles.

However, he had only comprehended three principles, and if he fused them together, he would only be able to fuse two. He was still far from breaking through to become a Ruler.

Furthermore, he was a cultivator at the level of a perfect being, and the level of a perfect being was limited by the principles of the universe. The conditions for breaking through might be much more difficult than ordinary cultivators.

For example, from the Immortal Saint to the Principles Master...

An ordinary Immortal Saint could make a breakthrough as long as he completely comprehended one principle and grasped a part of the power of his will.

However, he had already comprehended three principles and merged two principles, but there was still no sign of a breakthrough.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was worried that after he became a Principles Master, it would be much more difficult for him to break through to the Ruler Realm than for ordinary cultivators.

“You’re still far from the Ruler Realm, so you should try your best to improve your strength. What we need to do is to do our best to help you improve your strength.”

Daoist Xuan Shen said in a low voice, “Little guy, you’ve made it clear. You know how important you are to us, so you don’t need to be polite or pretentious. If you need anything that can help you improve your strength, just tell us. We’ll do our best to help you.”

“Yes, not only in terms of cultivation, but also all kinds of treasures and supreme treasures. If you need anything, you can tell us directly.” Temporal Temple Master also nodded. As for the Heaven Ancestor, he was also very determined.

The three of them knew that Jian Wushuang was the only one who could save the Divine Beginning Realm from danger.

What Jian Wushuang needed to do was to improve his strength as much as possible and reach the Ruler Realm as soon as possible. What they needed to do, of course, was to help Jian Wushuang become a Ruler. As long as Jian Wushuang could become a Ruler as soon as possible…they would do anything.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang stopped being unreasonable and said directly, “Seniors, I do need something now.”

“Speak.” Daoist Xuan Shen looked over.

“First of all, there are some rare treasures. Here is the list. Take a look first.” Jian Wushuang took out a list of treasures.

The treasures on the list were necessary for him to cultivate the first level of the supreme eternal celestial body. Although there were only six of them, they were extremely rare. Before he obtained the supreme eternal celestial body…Jian Wushuang had never even heard of these six treasures. Therefore, although he took out the list of six treasures, he did not know if Daoist Xuan Shen and the others could collect all of them.

Sure enough, after seeing the six treasures on the list, Daoist Xuan Shen, Temporal Temple Master, and Heaven Ancestor’s expressions changed immediately.

“Little guy, each of the treasures on the list is indeed extremely rare. There are none in my Star Palace. Even including the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, Temporal Temple, and Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect, there are only two of them.” Daoist Xuan Shen sighed softly.

“Is there no way to collect all of them?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“That’s not the case.” Daoist Xuan Shen changed the topic. “We already have two of the six treasures. We know where to get three of the remaining four treasures, and we are confident that we can get them. The last one, the Netherfire Blood Crystal, is a bit troublesome.”

“I’ve heard that someone has obtained the Netherfire Blood Crystal, but it has been tens of millions of years. I don’t know whether the news is true or not. Even if it is true, I can’t confirm who has it. However, I can contact the experts who might get the Netherfire Blood Crystal. I’ll get it no matter what the price is,” the Heaven Ancestor said in a deep voice.

“How long will it take?” Jian Wushuang asked.
