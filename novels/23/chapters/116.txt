Chapter 117: Blood Shadow Team

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Many ghostly figures rushed towards Jian Wushuang from all directions, with the Black sharp edges in their hands aimed at his vital parts, stabbing out at tricky angles.

These ghostly figures were the other nine members of the Blood Shadow team.

Although the gold-masked assassins of the two teams were not as good as the Darkblader in terms of strength, they were still top-ranked assassins. Most of them had enough strength to assassinate experts on the Earthly Dragon List.

“Go to hell!”

With a heavy outburst, a powerful sword essence was released, and Jian Wushuang lashed out with his Triple-kill Sword.

Sword light passed by silently, but suddenly there were many strange waves rippling in the air. These waves contained terrible impact force, directly spreading out in all directions.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

After nine consecutive loud noises, the nine gold-masked assassins that had rushed in were all expelled directly and relentlessly. They were knocked several meters away before they finally managed to regain their balance.

There was a little shock in the eyes of gold-masked assassins.

As gold-masked assassins, especially assassins in the Blood Shadow team, each of them had reached the peak of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Although they were not as powerful as the experts on the Earthly Dragon List, they were not far away from them.

If it was an assassination, each of them had the strength to assassinate experts on the Earthly Dragon List.

But now, all nine people were pushed back by Jian Wushuang with only one move.

What was this strength?

As for the Darkblader, who was the first one knocked back by Jian Wushuang, his dark eyes squinted suddenly, not looking at Jian Wushuang, but Su Rou.

He was very clear on how perfect the assassination attempt was just now. Jian Wushuang should have definitely died. But this perfect assassination failed, because of Su Rou.

“This woman is weird,” said Darkblader in a low voice.

…

Everything happened too fast.

Starting with the first attack from Darkblader, then the nine gold-masked assassins who were repelled by Jian Wushuang with only one move. in fact, all this happened in a split second. However, many of the warriors beside Quiet Moon Lake did not realize what happened until it was already over.

“What happened?”

“What a terrifying atmosphere! What’s wrong?”

“Swordsman, it’s Swordsman. Are those gold-masked men from Blood Feather Tower?”

“It’s Blood Feather Tower all right. They are gold-masked assassins from Blood Feather Tower. What’s more, there are ten gold-masked assassins in total. And all of them have come for Swordsman.”

“Do people in Blood Feather Tower want to kill Swordsman?”

There was quite a commotion around the whole Quiet Moon Lake. All the Warriors immediately looked there, but they were shocked by what they saw.

But there was nothing they could do. Blood Feather Tower was synonymous with terrible in the Tianzong Dynasty.

Faced with the top assassin organization in Tianzong Dynasty, everyone was afraid. Normally, the people that Blood Feather Tower wanted to kill would have no chance of surviving.

“Blood Feather Tower!”

There was a heavy killing intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, but his heart shrank when he looked at all these gold-masked assassins.

He knew that since assassins from Blood Feather Tower were here, it meant that his identity had been exposed.

According to the assassination style of Blood Feather Tower, since they had attacked, they must be prepared. Although the ten gold-masked assassins in front of him could threaten him, he was sure that this was not all Blood Feather Tower had prepared.

“Blood Feather Tower, how dare you try to assassinate a disciple of Dragon Palace. Are you not afraid that Dragon Palace will seek revenge?” Jian Wushuang shouted and his voice spread out over the area.

“A disciple of Dragon Palace?”

“Is Swordsman really a disciple of Dragon Palace?”

“Just play a joke. He is just an Initial Completion of the Golden Pill Realm with so powerful battle strength that only the eccentric genius of Dragon Palace can do it.”

All the surrounding warriors were scared, and no one dared to intervene.

“Blood Feather Tower?” Xiao Mang, who was sitting cross-legged under a big tree, also saw the scene that was occurring beside Quiet Moon Lake. His brows slightly wrinkled, but he immediately shook his head slowly after that.

Normally, he might help Jian Wushuang. After all, Jian Wushuang had given him a Bottleneck-breaking Pill today, so he felt a great amount of gratitude towards Jian Wushuang that he would not forget. However, his spiritual power had been exhausted in the fight earlier, and he had not recovered enough yet to be able to offer any help.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang could only fend for himself.

Of course, Jian Wushuang never thought that someone would come to help him. His purpose was to merely to spread his identity.

That way, regardless of whether he lived or died today, Blood Feather Tower would suffer the crazy revenge of Dragon Palace later.

Dragon Palace put a lot of emphasis on protecting their disciples. Whoever bullied the disciples of Dragon Palace would not have a good ending unless Dragon Palace never knew about it.

And Jian Wushuang had shocked the whole Dragon Palace by passing through the eleventh level of the Dragon Gate. Now, the two Palace Masters and the Temple Masters of Dragon Palace thought that Jian Wushuang was an extremely rare genius.

Once such a genius was killed, Dragon Palace would feel so much pain that their revenge would be much more malicious.

“Jian Wushuang,” Darkblader said. “Today, don’t talk about the Dragon Palace. Even the gods can’t help you. You will die. Nobody can save you.”

“Come on. Kill him!”

As his voice faded, Darkblader took the lead, and the nine gold-masked assassins followed.

“You?” Jian Wushuang smirked and his figure turned ghostly.

Chuu!

A sword shadow appeared silently in front of one of the gold-masked assassins. Without any time for him to respond, in just a blink, this gold-masked assassin was directly killed by the sword edge which passed through his neck.

Followed by another ghostly image of Jian Wushuang.

SHUA!

The same silent sword swept past the throat of another gold-masked assassin.

“What happened?” The rest of the gold-masked assassins were shocked.

“This is?” Darkblader also glowered.

Two gold-masked assassins were instantly killed in just a moment, but they did not even see the Jian Wushuang’s figure.

Fast. He was too fast.

Not only the speed of his body, but also the speed of his sword!

“Formless Sword Arts, sixth move!” The two purple-masked assassins, standing side by side on a tree in the forest, gazed intently.

“Such a large error in the intelligence report! Jian Wushuang is much stronger than reported, and the woman beside him is also weird. She was able to respond to that perfect assassination attempt by Darkblader,” murmured a purple-masked assassin.

“It is too late to talk about that. Now that we have taken action, there is no way out. It is obvious that Darkblader cannot kill Jian Wushuang, so it’s up to you.” murmured the other purple-masked assassin. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“If I join in the fight, he will definitely die!” The first purple-masked assassin nodded slightly, then his figure direct rushed out.
