4232 Snake Slaying (Part Three)

“Continue!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. He turned his right hand and changed his move quickly. Once again, he thrust his sword at Moluo’s throat!

Clang!

The tip of the Wuqi Divine Sword was pointed at Moluo’s throat. A sharp and overbearing sword intent exploded, instantly blasting a huge white spot on Moluo’s throat.

As for Moluo’s right palm, it also slammed onto Jian Wushuang’s body and pressed him to the ground!

“What an annoying little fellow!”

Moluo’s voice was low and deep. his huge palm pressed down on Jian Wushuang and slammed down on the ground at an extremely fast speed.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The strong wind howled by Jian Wushuang’s ears. Under the palm, Jian Wushuang had the illusion that he was being pressed down by a hundred thousand mountains. The great power contained in the palm was not something he could resist at all.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes began to flash quickly.

Bang!

The palm finally hit the ground.

Ka-chak.

Under this palm, the earth began to crack inch by inch as if there was an earthquake. The cracks spread like a spider web, and the entire Eighth City was blown into pieces.

One pavilion after another fell, and some of the Ultimate Rulers standing on the ground paled and hurriedly rose to their feet.

“Blood Sword!”

“What?” Ruler Hao Jin’s heart instantly leaped into his throat as he cried out in alarm.

“Your Excellency Blood Sword!”

Jiuxi also clenched her fists tightly, looking extremely nervous.

Rumble!

The smoke and dust gradually dispersed. The ground split apart where Moluo’s giant palm had slammed down. Pavilions and halls collapsed, leaving behind broken walls and ruins.

Moluo was panting heavily. Two streams of red mist were spurted out from his nostrils.

“Little brat, go to hell!”

He lowered his head to look at his palm, and the corners of his mouth unconsciously curled up.

He could feel that his destructive slap had hit Jian Wushuang perfectly.

He also believed that his palm, which could shatter stars, could turn Jian Wushuang into a meat paste.

He slowly raised his palm and looked down.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

All of a sudden, Moluo’s two spear-like eyebrows twisted. Under his palm, other than a huge pit that was dozens of feet deep, where was Jian Wushuang’s figure? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The next moment!

“Sundering stars!”

A cold shout suddenly exploded in his ears!

Moluo quickly turned his head and saw Jian Wushuang stepping in the air. With his black hair flying in the air, he held a silver sword rainbow and slashed at him fiercely!

How could it be so fast?!

Moluo’s expression changed. He could feel that his palm had hit Jian Wushuang at the first moment. Then, when did Jian Wushuang escape?

Pfff!

Before he could react, the silver sword rainbow in Jian Wushuang’s hand instantly pierced through the heaven and earth. Carrying the power to destroy stars, it slashed toward Moluo’s huge arm!

“Roar!”

Moluo opened his mouth and roared loudly. He could feel that the power of this sword was even more terrifying than all the previous sword lights!

The silver sword rainbow emitted a world-destroying power that even made him feel a sense of threat.

Moluo had only felt this sense of threat from those geniuses and geniuses in the eight cities behind him.

Bang!

Without any obstruction, the silver sword rainbow cut off Moluo’s right arm like a knife cutting through tofu!

Bang!

The huge, pitch-black arm crashed into the ground, causing the Eighth City to shake.

As for Moluo, he immediately covered the area where his arm was broken with his other hand. He roared madly with eyes filled with hatred and anger.

Countless drops of divine blood fell like a blood rain.

The Moluo clan specialized in cultivating their physical bodies. They were different from ordinary cultivators. They were not like ordinary cultivators who could be immortal as long as their divine power was still present.

Once their divine bodies were injured, it was a fatal blow. Without several thousand years, they couldn’t recover.

“Little brat, you’ve completely infuriated me!”

Moluo’s scarlet eyes were wide open. His chest was heaving up and down violently as he panted.

At this moment, he was truly enraged.

Moluo trampling!!!

Moluo opened his mouth and roared. He raised his giant foot and stomped on the ground ferociously.

Bang!

There was a loud explosion!

Immediately, it was as if a tsunami had occurred in the Eighth City, and the city trembled madly.

Countless floorboards were flipped up, and the buildings that were still standing collapsed one after another!

The entire Eighth City was reduced to ruins in an instant!

Immediately after, a huge shock wave spread out in all directions from Moluo!

This shock wave swept past like a hurricane. Wherever the shock wave passed, the ground collapsed by a few hundred feet!

“Is this the combat power of the last eight cities?”

“He’s too strong! As expected of an expert from the back eight cities!”

“It’s hard to imagine that someone as powerful as Moluo could be injured to the point of near death in the last eight cities. Just how heaven-defying are those top geniuses of the last eight cities?”

At this moment, countless people cried out in horror.

There were even some who laughed bitterly at themselves.

“We are both Omega Rulers, but the difference between us is so great.”

Someone sighed.

No matter if it was Jian Wushuang or Moluo, they both admitted that they were far from being a match for him.

…

Bang!

The battle was still ongoing!

The shock wave rushed toward Jian Wushuang like a tide.

Under the shock wave, Jian Wushuang was like a small boat in a raging sea. It was as if he would be crushed by the shock wave at any time.

“The principles of the universe, the power of will!”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly without any expression. In an instant, the tenfold power of will granted to him by the laws of the universe was activated!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s aura began to soar!

“Suppress!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and stomped his right foot heavily.

Instantly, the mountains and seas calmed down, and the shockwaves that had swept through everything gradually calmed down.

Jian Wushuang stood still in the shock wave like a sea-stabilizing needle.

When Moluo saw this scene, his huge pupils immediately contracted.

Immediately after, he roared again, “Moluo’s charge!!”

Bang!

Moluo stomped his right foot heavily and bent his body. His curved and sharp horns pointed straight at Jian Wushuang.

In the next moment, Moluo started to step down with his right foot and started to dash toward Jian Wushuang!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Just like the legendary kuafu chasing after the sun, Moluo’s every step caused the Eighth City to tremble.

His speed was getting faster and faster!

In the end, Moluo’s body turned into a huge black light and charged forward ferociously!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and shouted again, “Sundering stars!”

Bang!

A silver sword rainbow was slashed out by Jian Wushuang and it slashed toward Moluo!

And this was not the end.

Jian Wushuang laughed in a low voice.

“Sundering stars!”

“Sundering stars!”

“Sundering stars!”

Several sundering stars were unleashed from the Wuqi Divine Sword in succession and bombarded Moluo!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Immediately, Moluo’s charging figure began to slow down gradually as the silver sword rainbows slashed at his body.

In the end, Moluo could no longer bear it as he roared in pain. His body stopped moving.
