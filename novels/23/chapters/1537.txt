Chapter 1538: Void Corridor

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This is…”

Jian Wushuang was in the dark corridor too. He was looking at his surroundings.

“Dreamland?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted and he could instantly tell that he should be in a phantasmagoria.

However, even though he could tell that he was in a dreamland, he couldn’t shake off the phantasmagoria forcefully.

“I can’t forcefully shake it off then. I can only let the dreamland change freely,” Jian Wushuang was certain about it.

Just then, he suddenly saw the light at the end of the dark corridor which was right in front of him.

The light was very dim but Jian Wushuang saw a string of hope.

“That’s the exit!”

“As long as I get there, I’ll be able to exit this dreamland.”

Jian Wushuang had already decided.

In the dreamland, Jian Wushuang would follow what his heart said without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang immediately plunged directly towards the very end of the dark corridor.

That very moment, not only him but also more than a hundred thousand Universe Gods in the third level were facing the same scene as him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone fell into the phantasmagoria of a dark corridor. At the same time, they also faintly saw the light at the end of their fields of vision.

Just like Jian Wushuang, the Universe Gods immediately understood that the light was where the exit of the dreamland located.

It was also the very end of the dark corridor.

Hence, all the Universe Gods started plunging towards the end of the corridor.

In the dark corridor, their speeds weren’t restrained and every one of them gave full rein to their power. However, even plunging forward with such speed, after one day, ten days, one month, they could still barely see the light, let alone reach it.

Although the Universe Gods were shocked, they followed their true will and continued to plunge forward.

The dark corridor seemed to be never-ending.

Although the Universe Gods continued to plunge forward, after one year, two years and even ten years, the light at the end of the tunnel still didn’t grow any brighter.

Very quickly, the Universe Gods had been traveling in the dark corridor for a hundred and fifty years.

…

In the dark corridor, a purple-haired bewitching maiden suddenly slowed to a stop. She looked at the light at the very end of the corridor which was still very dim and her eyebrows were tightly knitted.

“What’s going on? I’ve been traveling forward for a hundred and fifty years in this corridor but I have yet to reach the end of it and I have yet to leave this dreamland?”

“Could it be that I made a wrong judgment? The light at the end of my sight isn’t where the exit of the dreamland is?”

The purple-haired bewitching maiden thought and she began to waver in her determination.

However, just as she wavered from her action

On the open ground of the third level, the purple-haired bewitching maiden’s eyes suddenly shot open.

“I, I… resolved the dreamland?” The purple-haired bewitching maiden muttered.

“Resolved the dreamland? Hehe, you didn’t break it but you lost the right to continue the test,” Real God Wu Bei’s voice suddenly rang inside her ears. He spoke with pity, “You only stayed in the dreamland for a hundred and fifty years and you’re sent out. You are so fragile at heart.”

“I lost?” The purple-haired bewitching maiden looked at her surrounding in surprise. She realized that everyone else was still keeping their eyes closed under the influence of the white light, besides herself. They were obviously still in the dreamland but only she was awake.

“It turns out that I am the first to be eliminated,” the purple-haired bewitching maiden couldn’t do anything but smile bitterly.

However, not long after she came back to reality, the Universe Gods around her woke up one after another.

“What happened?”

“Did we walk out of the dark corridor?”

The Universe Gods were shocked but they quickly understood that they had failed.

In the lofty hall outside the cave where all the experts had gathered, they received the updates from the Universe Gods on the third level who failed.

“Under the influence of such a formation, they fell in the phantasmagoria of traveling in a dark corridor. They traveled forward by a few hundred years in the dreamland but had yet to reach the end. However, the moment they were in doubt by a slight bit, they would be kicked out of the dreamland immediately.”

The Almighties exchanged a look and they quickly had an answer.

“It’s a void corridor!”

“The third test is a void corridor that is aiming at one’s mind?”

“Humph, the first test was Scattered Stars Game to test one’s comprehension. The second test was a strength test. The third test is a mental test. This madman Wu Bei is trying to picking his own disciple?”

Many experts in the hall creased their eyebrows.

They knew about the void corridor.

It was designated to test one’s mind.

The void corridor was boundless and unfathomable.

When one fell into the void corridor, the exit seemed to be within his sight. But in actual fact, it was unbelievably far away. Forget about traveling forward for a few hundred years, he might not be able to reach the end even after thousands or tens of thousands of years.

The void corridor tested if one was firm in their belief.

After everyone entered the void corridor, they were certain that the exit was at the end of the corridor. However, when the Universe Gods had traveled uneventfully over the years but couldn’t reach the end, it was inevitable that they started to waver in their belief but in doubt of their own judgment, they made a mistake.

The moment they were in doubt and wavered, the test ended.

The Universe Gods on the open ground who had already woken up traveled for a few hundred years in the void corridor. They were very determined at first. However, as time passed, they started to waver and then were eliminated.

Those who were still in the dreamland naturally could stay firm in their belief.

On the third level of Wu Bei’s cave.

As time flew past, there were more Universe Gods on the open ground who woke up.

As everyone had fallen into the dreamland at the same time, the latest to wake up represented the longest time spent in the dreamland. In other words, he was stronger in his belief.

Half a day later.

“Phew!”

A white-bearded elderly let out a breath of relief and slowly opened his eyes.

“Universe God Chang Qing, you woke up too?” A man in purple armor next to him looked up and asked.

“Yeah, I had no choice. It isn’t easy to stay determined as one continuous plunge forwards in such a boring and uneventful manner,” the white-haired elderly smiled helplessly.

“How long have you been traveling in the void corridor?” The man in purple armor asked.

“I wrote down my travel time before I started moving forward. It should have been one-thousand-nine-hundred-and-eighty years,” the white-bearded elderly replied.
