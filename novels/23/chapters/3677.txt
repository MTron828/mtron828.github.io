Chapter 3678: Ten Years

Daoist Xuan God spoke casually as if he was joking.

However, when Xuan Yan heard these words, it undoubtedly stirred up a huge storm in his heart.

“Absolute invincibility in the Divine Beginning Realm?”

Xuan Yan knew the weight of these words.

“He also has a perfect life level and is comparable to a Ruler at the level of a Principles Master. It seems that Xuan Yi’s plan really succeeded?”

Xuan Yan was full of disbelief.

He knew how crazy and Unbelievable Xuan Yi’s plan was.

He did not think that the plan would succeed at all, nor did he think that the Seven Star Mysterious Sect had a chance to turn things around. But now...looking at Jian Wushuang in front of him, he had to admit…Xuan Yi’s plan had indeed succeeded.

Xuan Yi had nurtured Jian Wushuang, a successor who could replace him and even surpass him.

The Divine Beginning Realm and the Seven Star Mysterious Sect now had a chance to fight again because of Jian Wushuang’s existence.

Taking a deep breath, Xuan Yan raised his head again and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, I apologize for what happened just now. I admit that you have the right to be my equal. Now that this world has been refined by you, I will listen to your arrangements in this world.”

“Thank you, Mr. Xuan Yan.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

He did not have a good impression of Xuan Yan, but he did not dislike him. After all, although Xuan Yan was a bit overbearing and unreasonable, he was a master level expert left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. In the world-destroying battle, he had contributed a lot to the world-ending battle.

In addition, when he was adventuring in the Eternal Chaotic World, he had benefited from the Golden Dragon Turtle on Xuan Yan’s shoulder.

In view of this, Jian Wushuang was willing to have a normal relationship with Xuan Yan.

“Since Mr. Xuan Yan has agreed, I’ll start making arrangements.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect in front of him.

After seeing the Xuan God and knowing Jian Wushuang’s monstrous strength, these experts were all convinced.

“This world is, after all, an evolution of the Seven Star Divine Realm. It means a lot to everyone here. Although you have been sleeping for years, I’m afraid you still miss this world. So, I’ll give you ten years.”

“In these ten years, you can move around freely in this world. As long as you don’t kill recklessly, I won’t care. In ten years, I’ll directly open the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm. At that time, all the experts left by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect will have to leave!” Jian Wushuang said, it sounded a bit like an order.

There was nothing he could do. Although he knew that the Seven Star Divine Realm was actually the place of the experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, he had refined this world into his Heaven and Earth Secret Realm, which still had a complete cycle of Heavenly Dao, it was just a small cycle.

Under such circumstances, the current Eternal Chaotic World could no longer accommodate these Seven Star Mysterious Sect experts.

If these Seven Star Mysterious Sect experts continued to stay here, first of all, they would not be able to recover their own strength and could only fall into a deep sleep.

At the same time, because of their existence, they would have a great impact on this world’s Heavenly Dao cycle.

Putting everything else aside, just in terms of the heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, over the long years, most of the heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi in the Eternal Chaotic World had actually been absorbed by these ancient experts, even if they were sleeping, they had to ensure that they absorbed enough Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi before they could continue sleeping.

Hence, the cultivation environment in this world was getting worse and worse. Now, with great difficulty, because of the array formation left behind by Xuan Yi, there was slowly room for improvement.

However, the experts left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect definitely could not stay here.

“In ten years, we will all leave, but where is the space passage?” Xuan Yan asked.

“It’s in my Wushuang Saint Realm. Please come here in advance,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.”

Xuan Yan nodded and waved his hand, crushing the void and leaving.

As for the experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, most of them bowed slightly to Jian Wushuang and left.

After the experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect left, Jian Wushuang looked at the ‘Rulers’ in the Eternal Chaotic World.

“In ten years, the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm will be opened in Wushuang Saint Realm. If any of you want to go to the Divine Beginning Realm, be prepared to go together,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.”

The ‘Rulers’ nodded respectfully and quickly went to prepare.

Although ten years was short, it was enough for the ‘Rulers’ to go back and make arrangements.

…

The Green Fire World, Tang of the East.

Tang of the East had been established in the Green Fire World for countless years. When Jian Wushuang was in the beginning, Tang of the East was already recognized as the first country in the Green Fire World. Even now, tens of millions of years had passed, the Tang of the East was still the strongest country, and no one dared to provoke it.

After all, behind the Tang of the East stood the Wushuang Saint Realm!

“Third brother, this is the Imperial City of the Tang of the East. It has been tens of millions of years. The Imperial City of the Tang of the East is much larger than before, but its geographical location is still here.”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou personally led Jian Wushuang to a void in the Imperial City of Tang of the east.

“The 13 blood demon gods directly entered the Imperial City and fought with second brother and the others in the Imperial City. In the end, second brother, Ruler Xiao, and Ruler Tang all died in that battle.” Wang Yuan looked a little lonely, but soon, there was a flash of brilliance.

“Third brother, is what you just told us true? Do you really have a way to resurrect second brother and the others?”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang with a trace of disbelief.

After Jian Wushuang asked the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and the Rulers of the Eternal Chaotic World to prepare to leave this world, Jian Wushuang found Wang Yuan and Su Rou and told them that he had a way…he could bring the dead second brother, Yang Zaixuan, back to life.

Wang Yuan and Su Rou were naturally overjoyed, and the three of them immediately came to this place.

However, although Jian Wushuang said this, to bring a dead person back to life, and it was someone who had been dead for tens of millions of years, in Wang Yuan and Su Rou’s eyes…it was indeed a little too incredible.

“It’s not impossible to resurrect the dead. Tens of millions of years ago, at the ends of the Earth, I actually died once. However, my master Xuan Yi immediately used space-time reversal to save my soul. Then, he sent me to the Divine Beginning Realm. That’s how I am now.”
