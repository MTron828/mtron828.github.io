4669 I Am the Great Dao, Who Can Kill Me?

When the Dao Field formed by extreme resentment swept over, Jian Wushuang waved his hand in the air.

The invisible Laws of the Great Dao protected everyone, with him as the center.

As he looked around, he felt that the world had fallen into extreme darkness. The clay idol, which belonged to the peak of the universe, had an Ancestor realm aura that could actually resist Jian Wushuang.

In the center of the evil Dao Field, the clay idol smiled gloomily. With a wave of his hand, a chasm appeared in the void. At the same time, countless terrifying and strange souls struggled from within, wailing in pain and hysteria.

The moment the demonic sound was heard, Han Ya and the young cultivator lost their consciousness. Blood gushed out of their mouths and noses. They were on the verge of death.

Old Master tapped the scepter in his hand lightly, and the Black Water barrier enveloped the two of them, then pushed them out of the battle range.

The countless souls were cultivators that the clay idol had crazily killed and devoured in the past million years. The resentment that could not be quelled and the terrifying power made even Jian Wushuang have to guard his heart to prevent his mind from being eroded by the demonic sound.

The Tarot Divine Sword appeared in his hand, but he was shocked.

The fierceness and ruthlessness of the Tarot Sword’s Sword Embryo had actually been triggered, and it could bite back at its master at any time.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly and put the Tarot Divine Sword back into its sheath. Then, he summoned the Invisible Sword.

The Invisible Sword was formed by the purest Sword Intent after he had mastered the Wushuang Sword Dao, the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

Even one of the Seven Supreme Great Ancestral Weapons, the Tarot Divine Sword, could not be compared to it in terms of compatibility or purity.

From a certain perspective, the Invisible Sword was also an Ancestral Weapon that belonged to Jian Wushuang.

With the Invisible Sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang did not stop at all. He immediately released the first move of the star River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

“Star.”

The Laws of the Great Dao in the majestic temple were all condensed in this sword strike, turning into a soaring sword will that slashed forward.

At the same time, an earth-shaking ancestral image appeared behind Jian Wushuang and also swung its heaviest sword.

The evil Dao Field collapsed in an instant. The countless souls that rushed out of the chasm only had time to let out a scream before they were all destroyed by the vast Sword Intent.

Hundreds of beams of light rose into the sky, completely crushing the arrangement of Lu Ding’s clay idol.

Under this resistance, even the great sun hanging above the Star Field seemed to show signs of falling. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Become my nourishment. I promise to take you to find Wang Mi Secret Realm.” He opened his arms and looked at Jian Wushuang with an intoxicated expression.

Jian Wushuang did not speak. He could feel the compass formation beneath his feet weakening his divine power.

The next moment, countless ghost hands of resentment rushed out of the compass formation and tried to grab the two.

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly and was about to attack, but the Old Master was one step ahead of him. The black scepter in his hand suddenly stopped.

A unique power that surpassed the level of divine power spread out like waves, and the resentful ghost hand that had just risen was immediately destroyed.

Even the strange compass formation had countless cracks on it.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang took a step forward with steady momentum. He raised the Invisible Sword in his hand and threw it at the clay idol.

The brilliant divine power pierced through the eternal darkness and hit his heart.

The extreme light flickered, and the clay idol, which was almost cut into two by the Invisible Sword, stood in place in a daze, as if he had not reacted.

The next moment, the void twisted quickly, and the clay idol smiled strangely. His body, which had almost been cut in half, was restored in an instant, leaving no trace of injury.

Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. He had grown so strong in a million years?

With his arms still wide open, the Lu Ding clay idol laughed sinisterly. “I am the Great Dao. Who can kill me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a scepter that was like a giant pillar directly smashed down on his head.

With a ‘bang’, the left half of the Lu Ding clay idol’s body shattered.

The power belonging to the Ancestor realm gushed out uncontrollably. He screamed and covered the torn wound with force.

Jian Wushuang sneered, “You dare to call yourself the Great Dao? Aren’t you afraid of karma?”

Barely stopping the energy from leaking out of his body, the Lu Ding clay idol had already weakened to another level.

The clay idol gave the two of them a venomous look, then turned around and turned into thousands of dim lights, scattering into the void.

“You want to leave?” Jian Wushuang sneered and pulled at the void. The Laws of Great Dao collapsed and closed.

The clay idol that had turned into a ghostly light was caught by the Laws of the Great Dao and could not move at all.

“No, you can’t kill me!” Perhaps it had a premonition that it was facing a great horror of life and death, so the Lu Ding clay idol was extremely frightened.

“I’m the incarnation of the Laws of the Great Dao. None of you can kill me!” He continued to clamor.

After using his unparalleled divine power to compress it into the size of a grain of dust, Jian Wushuang looked at the struggling clay idol between his fingers and was ready to kill him.

However, what shocked him was that although the clay idol’s body was easily destroyed, it only condensed back together a moment later. It was extremely strange.

“He has already transcended the restrictions of this universe. You can’t kill him,” Old Master said calmly.

Jian Wushuang thought about it carefully and understood. He no longer insisted on killing the clay idol. He then extracted the clay idol’s life source and sealed it.

After doing all this, he heaved a sigh of relief. The disappearance of the Lu Ding clay idol had been a sore point in his heart for millions of years. Now that it had been suppressed, everything was finally back on track.

“This time, it’s finally completely settled down.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

“What’s your next step?” Old Master asked.

Jian Wushuang replied, “I’ll return to Cloud Palace and take care of some matters. Then, I’ll lead the army into the Void Universe and eradicate it completely.”

Old Master nodded and did not say anything else.

Using the power of Great Dao, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and restored the Genyang Star Field that had been destroyed in the battle.

The spring grass came back to life, the protective water surged again, and all living things were born in it.

However, the countless cultivators who were killed by the clay idol could not be resurrected. As all living beings were resurrected, their bodies gradually turned into a handful of sand.

Feeling a sharp pain in his body, the young cultivator who was unconscious on the coffin lid woke up from his coma.

“What’s going on? Didn’t this place get destroyed?”

The young cultivator murmured as he looked at the green grass on the ground. However, his eyes quickly turned to himself and he could not help but exclaim.

His entire body emitted countless rays of white light.
