Chapter 1157: Secret Land

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Time flew away. In a blink of an eye, eight years had passed.

Jian Wushuang’s death had once stirred up great chaos in the Green Fire Palace, but with the elapse of time, their surprise and anger faded away.

“Shoo!”

All of a sudden, a bulky figure appeared above the vast battlefield near the Chillywind Valley.

He wore black armors and a black helmet, and there was a black unicorn on his forehead. He looked down at the ground coldly.

“Here it is,” Samsara Temple Master murmured, and then he sent a message to Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, I found the place. Let your worm beast show up.”

“Okay, wait a moment,” Jian Wushuang responded. Soon he summoned Gu King.

Parasitic on Jian Wushuang, Gu King was closely connected to him. As long as they were not far away, they could communicate with each other through consciousness.

After receiving Jian Wushuang’s message, Gu King came out from the depths of the ground.

“Is this Jian Wushuang’s worm beast?”?Samsara Temple Master looked at Gu King and thought in surprise. After that, he said, “Little thing, your master asked me to bring you back to him.”

“Little thing?”?Gu King grumbled in his heart.?“When I traveled widely in the Eternal Chaotic World with King Luo Zhen, you brat were not yet born, and even this world had not yet come into being. How dare you call me little thing!”

Angry as he was, Gu King did not lose temper. When his body shrank to the size of an adult’s finger, he took a leap and perched on Samsara Temple Master. Although Samsara Temple Master traveled at an exceedingly fast speed, it still took him more than a decade to return to Green Fire Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, your worm beast,” Samsara Temple Master said, while handing Gu King to Jian Wushuang.

“Thanks!” Jian Wushuang said plainly but secretly felt very much delighted to meet Gu King again.

Soon enough, Gu King entered Jian Wushuang’s body again. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Gu King, are you alright?” Jian Wushuang asked.

When Gu King had been on the run back then, he took a blow from Red Snow King.

“Look at me, do you think I got hurt?” Gu King responded with disdain. “You should worry about yourself. You’re lucky to have two Original Bodies. Losing one of them will not threaten your life. Otherwise, you would’ve died.”

Jian Wushuang was rendered speechless.

His two Original Bodies was indeed a useful trump card, which benefited him a lot.

However, his two Original Bodies could not exist forever.

Now he was just a Dao Master, so he could possess two Original Bodies at the same time. However, once he made a breakthrough and reached the level of a Holy Master, he would have to integrate his two Original Bodies into a Dharma Body. At that time, he would only have one Original Body left.

“Jian Wushuang, here are your treasures. Keep them well. To protect them, I even got badly hurt. If you’re in danger again, don’t expect me to escape away with your treasures again,” Gu King said.

“I have learned from this awkward experience. How could I put myself in such a situation again?” Jian Wushuang tittered, putting his treasure aside.

He put on his Blood-killing Plate Armor again.

“It’s a pity that Blaze Quicksand Gourd was lost in the Chillywind Valley. I don’t know if I can take it back one day,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“It’s just a Blaze Quicksand Gourd. It’s not a big deal. The battlefield where you are is a huge Treasure Vault. As long as you have strong power, you can get whatever you want,” Gu King responded, curling his lip.

“You’re right,” Jian Wushuang laughed. In fact, he did not attach much importance to it, either.

In the following days, Jian Wushuang still waited in the secret chamber.

After a couple of days, the five Palace Masters finally intended to lay hands on Golden Axe Holy Master.

Within Green Fire Palace, Golden Axe Holy Master stood in a hall alone. He looked calm on the outside but in fact he was feeling slightly nervous.

“Jian Wushuang died not long ago. Why did Sunrise Sword Emperor summon me here?”?Golden Axe Holy Master was lost in thought.

“Did he find out anything about me?

“It’s impossible.”

Golden Axe Holy Master shook his head and comforted himself,?” I left no traces. Besides, Jian Wushuang already died. No one will know that he told his location to me before his death.

“Even Jian Wushuang himself would’ve never thought that it was me who betrayed him, since at that time he must’ve been busy fleeing from the kings of the Jin Kingdomng.

“Even if the Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace had perceived something suspicious on Jian Wushuang’s assassination, they would never have been able to connect his death to me.”

Golden Axe Holy Master thought confidently.

“After all, a dead man could not talk.

“Jian Wushuang is dead, and no one knew that he talked to me before his death. I’ll never be suspected.”

However, Golden Axe Holy Master did not know that Jian Wushuang was still alive.

A moment later, two figures entered the hall.

“Bai Feng Holy Master, Celestial Master Feng!” Golden Axe Holy Master said smilingly.

“Golden Axe Holy Master.”

Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng greeted him cordially.

“Are you summoned here by Sunrise Sword Emperor as well?” Golden Axe Holy Master asked.

“Yes,” Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng nodded at the same time.

Golden Axe Holy Master was relieved, a hint of joy flashing across his eyes.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor did not summon me here alone. He also invited Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng. It seems that he has met some problem in Formation. He didn’t summon us here because of Jian Wushuang,”?Golden Axe Holy Master thought with a sly smile on his face.

Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng were good at Formation, and so was Golden Axe Holy Master.

After a while, Sunrise Sword Emperor entered the hall.

“Here you are.”

Sunrise Sword Emperor looked down at them as he said, “You three are proficient in Formation. That’s why I summoned you here today. I can not tell you details here. I’ll explain to you when we arrive at the destination.”

“Yes, Palace Master.” The three nodded solemnly.

The three Holy Masters followed Sunrise Sword Emperor and headed for the battlefield.

The four of them spent several years reaching a virgin area.

There was a mysterious place at the bottom of the cliffs, which was under the Restriction.

“What’s this?”

The three Holy Masters gazed at this place with confusion.

“Lately I have passed above the cliffs and discovered this Secret Land by chance,” Sunrise Sword Emperor explained.

“Secret Land?” Golden Axe Holy Master, Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng were taken by great surprise.

There were countless mysterious places on this vast battlefield, but only a few of them could be referred to as Secret Lands.
