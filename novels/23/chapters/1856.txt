Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Back then, with Fortress Master Hong Tian as the leader, Deluge Fortress gathered a total of thirteen Almighties and this power was already extremely shocking. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was only because of the fact that Jian Wushuang had invited Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin along that he had managed to destroy the Deluge Fortress.

However, the Abysmal Palace’s lineup then was a lot more powerful than the Deluge Fortress. In particular, they had Palace Master Wu Luo, who possessed an impressive amount of fighting capabilities.

Palace Master Wu Luo was ranked twenty-five on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and he was slightly more powerful than Emperor God Liu Guang.

Moreover, even Jian Wushuang had to admit that this lineup was extremely powerful.

“The stronger the lineup, the better it will be,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was ice-cold.

“Now, most of those experts that my Lineage of Star are trying to recruit are still looking on from the sidelines and they are unable to make a decision. That is because, to date, they are still unable to see whether the Lineage of Star will survive and they feel that it is no different from digging their own graves if they were to join the Lineage of Star now. However, if my Lineage of Star were able to reveal powerful fighting capabilities and show that we are extremely frightening, those experts will then be able to have hope and be willing to join my Lineage of Star at this stage!”

For them to become top experts, all of them had to be intelligent and crafty.

For a powerhouse that was about to be destroyed, even if it were to offer good rewards or conditions that could attract them, they would definitely not agree to it.

However, if they were to think that the powerhouse might not be destroyed and that it had great potential, that would be completely different. Moreover, they might even join of their own accord.

“The Abysmal Palace’s appearance has given the Lineage of Star a chance instead!”

“A chance to reveal to everyone our absolute abilities.”

“Our Lineage of Star must definitely win this battle. Moreover, we must have a great victory and we must use this great victory to frighten everyone!”

Jian Wushuang’s chilly voice reverberated across the area.

The three Hall Masters below were filled with excitement as well.

So what if it were the Abysmal Palace? As long as the Abysmal Saint Master was unable to show himself, the Lineage of Star had nothing to fear!!

“Palace Master, we have gotten news that the spaceship that the Abysmal Palace is riding on has already appeared near the Cloud Island. I reckon that in half a day’s time, they should be able to fight their way to outside the Universe Galaxy,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“There’s no need for us to wait for another half a day. We shall head out right away and meet them head-on,” Jian Wushuang said at once.

“Meet them head-on?” Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun looked in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

They had originally thought that Jian Wushuang had wanted to use the geographical features of the Universe Galaxy, a trump card, to his advantage and then fight with the Abysmal Palace head-on.

However, Jian Wushuang wanted to take the initiative to fight his way to them…

“It’s just an Abysmal Palace and there is no need for the Lineage of Star to expose a trump card like the Universe Galaxy. Even if we were to meet them head-on, the Lineage of Star would still be able to have a great victory!” Jian Wushuang said right away.

“Meet them!”

“Meet them head-on!”

The three Hall Masters nodded their heads earnestly.

At once, Jian Wushuang led the two Sir Gods, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun personally along with Jian Yi.

As for Hall Master Yuan, he was a weapon’s spirit and he was unable to go out to meet the enemies. Moreover, he had to stay to take charge of the Universe Galaxy.

…

In a vast void in the Star Land, a giant spaceship was travelling forward with shocking speed.

In the spaceship, the eighteen Almighties of the Abysmal Palace were all gathered inside.

“There are quite a number of people following behind me. There are even a few Almighties as well,” a silvery-white-armored, arrogant youth, who wore an alluring smile, was chatting.

“Those people are all scouts from all the powerhouses. Previously, all of them were worried as to whether the Star Palace Master was really dead. Hence, all of them were extremely fearful and they did not dare to act recklessly. And now, my Abysmal Palace has become the first to take action for them,” a green-clothed young lady said.

“The first to take action? Haha, my Abysmal Palace does not care at all. After all, in front of absolute abilities, everything else is nonexistent,” the arrogant youth was filled with disdain.

All the powerhouses of the Sanctuary Alliance were worried about the Star Palace Master.

However, the Abysmal Palace did not care at all as they had the Abysmal Saint Master backing them.

Even if the Star Palace Master were still alive, they would dare to fight their way in right away.

“Among those scouts, there should be someone from the Lineage of Star, right? My Abysmal Palace has done things this time around in a way that attracts a lot of attention. Hence, the Lineage of Star has definitely gotten the news a long time ago. After knowing that my Abysmal Palace is coming, the people in the Lineage of Star are probably so shocked that they are trembling in fear,” the arrogant youth sneered.

“Don’t underestimate the Lineage of Star, especially that Sword Emperor. After all, back then, he killed the thirteen Almighties including the Fortress Master Hong Tian in the Deluge Fortress with violent techniques,” the green-clothed young lady said.

“Hmph, he only managed to destroy the Deluge Fortress due to the presence of Emperor God Liu Guang. As for Sword Emperor’s own abilities, he is merely a Peak Emperor God. This time around, when my Abysmal Palace has come personally, who would dare to help him to go against my Abysmal Palace? Moreover, even if he were to invite Emperor God Liu Guang over again, it would be fine. With Palace Master here, what is a mere Emperor God Liu Guang considered to him?” the arrogant youth snorted coldly.

“You’re right,” the green-clothed young lady nodded her head as well.

Their eyes then happened to look in the direction of Palace Master Wu Luo at the same time and their eyes were filled with respect.

Just then…

An ancient silver spaceship came from the void in front and the large number of Almighties in the Abysmal Palace realized it at once.

“This is Sword Emperor’s spaceship?” the Almighties in the Abysmal Palace were stunned.

They had planned to fight their way into the base of the Lineage of Star. However, who could have expected that before they could reach the base of the Lineage of Star, the Lineage of Star would actually take the initiative to come out?

“Haha, the Lineage of Star’s people are really extremely stupid. Even though they knew that we were coming, they did not stay in their base obediently and stop us with all their might with the aid of the great formation. Instead, they took the initiative to come out? Are they sending themselves to death?” the arrogant youth was the first person to laugh loudly.

“The Lineage of Star is not this stupid, right? Could it be that they wish to negotiate or lower their heads to the Abysmal Palace?”

“Negotiate? Lower their heads? Hehe, that is highly possible.”

“Let’s go and take a look.”

Many experts of the Abysmal Palace wore a smile and walked out of the cabin.

In the vast void, the two spaceships had stopped moving and they confronted each other with a huge distance in between them.

The large number of experts of the Abysmal Palace had already come out from the spaceship and appeared at the void. As for the Lineage of Star, only Hall Master Gu Xin showed herself.

“I am Gu Xin from the Lineage of Star. Greetings to Palace Master Wu Luo, as well as everyone else from the Abysmal Palace,” Hall Master Gu Xin had a modest expression. However, her words and behavior did not contain any form of fear. “May I know why all of you have come on my Lineage of Star so abruptly?”

“Why have we come?”

The large number of experts from the Abysmal Palace laughed secretly. It was obvious that Hall Master Gu Xin asked the question even though she already knew the answer.
