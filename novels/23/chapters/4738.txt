4740 Sneak Attack and Serious Injury

If one were to look carefully, on the back of the giant ape, there was a slightly young and thin figure, who was looking at everything that was happening in the sky with excitement.

More than 20 new Yan Immortals surrounded Prince Yu and the other Yan Immortals like dumplings.

“Prince Lin?!” At this moment, the Young Emperor, Prince Yu, and Prince Jiu all shouted the same name.

It was the Seventh Prince, who he had met twice before and was the only one who had a good impression of the Young Emperor, Prince Lin.

“Big Brother, your mount is really cool! This is the first time I’ve used an immortal spirit as a mount!” Sitting on the monster ape’s back, the Seventh Prince looked at the Young Emperor and exclaimed.

The Young Emperor frowned. He did not expect this Prince to interfere at this time.

Prince Yu also looked at him in surprise and suspicion. Then, he asked in a deep voice, “What are you doing here? Are you going to fight for the Immortal Peach too?”

“Third Brother, please don’t misunderstand. I don’t have much interest in that kind of thing,” Prince Lin scratched his head and then raised his eyebrows and smiled. “I’m purely here to help Eldest Brother. You and Second Brother have gone too far.”

Prince Yu sneered and said, “Are you looking for death? Even if you join us, will you be able to change the result?”

“It’s hard to say if I’ll change, but I have to try, right?” Prince Lin said and stretched lazily on the monster ape’s back.

“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll just finish you off!” Prince Yu smiled and took the lead to attack.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Prince Lin saw this, he patted the monster ape’s head and fled.

Almost at the same time, a Yan Immortal who was in the same camp as Prince Lin also moved out and started fighting.

Jian Wushuang felt the pressure around him suddenly lighten and he no longer had the sense of urgency to resist.

Close to 50 Yan Immortals were engaged in a chaotic battle, and the explosion of different Yan powers was extremely beautiful.

Jian Wushuang looked at Prince Yu, who was attacking Prince Lin, and his eyes brightened.

“Be careful,” the Young Emperor reminded him in a low voice.

He nodded and placed his palm on the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword. His figure disappeared like a ghost.

Just as he was about to force the Prince back with his palm, he felt a strong sense of danger, which made him turn his head subconsciously.

“Tsk tsk…”

However, it was too late. The knife had cut half an inch into his flesh, almost cutting off his entire head.

Prince Yu retreated quickly and released Yan power to protect himself.

Looking at the mysterious young man dressed like a Ranger in black, Prince Yu felt a bone-deep pain from the wound on his neck.

With a shake of his wrist, the divine blood on the Tarot Divine Sword fell off. Jian Wushuang looked at him calmly.

He waved his hand to heal the wound on his neck. The craziness in Prince Yu’s eyes disappeared. He looked back at Jian Wushuang vigilantly.

To be able to get close to him without him knowing and almost behead him with a sword strike, such a terrifying strength made Prince Yu shudder.

Without any unnecessary pleasantries, Jian Wushuang directly lifted his sword and pressed down. The broken Tarot Divine Sword was full of great power.

The sword cut down and easily broke Prince Yu’s Yan power.

He was greatly shocked, and at the same time, he used all his strength to resist.

Although the body of the sword was broken, the sword principle was still there. Each sword carried a powerful momentum, which actually forced Prince Yu to start panicking.

Each sword move was as slow as water and wide open, making it difficult for Prince Yu to respond with the corresponding Yan power.

Although there was only one sword strike each time, it split into thousands of Sword Intents, forcing him to suffer more and more.

Jian Wushuang was like a blacksmith, while Prince Yu was like an iron embryo that was constantly being hammered. During this hammering process, each of his sword strikes was becoming more and more condensed.

Prince Yu almost fainted. In such a confrontation, he was actually being used as a whetstone?

He was so humiliated that he was ready to release his immortal move to kill Jian Wushuang like a bug.

But soon, Prince Yu was horrified to find that he could not summon the Immortal Style at all in his current state…

The powerful sword slashed down and directly plowed a shocking wound on Prince Yu’s lute bone. Divine blood gushed out.

This sword almost cut him into two from the middle.

Prince Yu was terrified. He found that this Grim Reaper-like young man was much more terrifying than he had imagined.

If the Young Emperor had brought him shock and confusion, then Jian Wushuang was the symbol of coldness and death.

By the time he realized the terror of life and death, it was already too late.

Without any unnecessary words, Jian Wushuang raised the broken divine sword in his hand high, as if it was a punishment and judgment, and then he struck down the last Invincible Sword.

However, the next moment, a sudden change occurred.

A light red scroll quietly swept out, and at the same time, a light beam directly pierced through Jian Wushuang’s back.

The warm divine blood sprayed on Prince Yu’s face.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned pale. In the end, he did not manage to slash down.

The Tarot Divine Sword slipped from his hand and fell into the abyss.

He also lost his strength and fell from the clouds like a fallen leaf.

“Jian Wushuang! What?” The Young Emperor cried out in shock and moved to pull him back almost at the same time.

However, a faint red barrier soon appeared and blocked him.

Prince Jiu walked out of the painting and looked at him with a faint smile. “I’m really sorry. My mistake has caused such an outcome. I’m afraid he can’t even be eliminated.”

The Young Emperor’s eyes turned from cold to furious. “Prince Jiu, you will die in my hands.”

“Oh, really? However, to prevent this from happening, I will make you, the Big Brother, disappear completely before that.” Prince Jiu spoke in a tone that only the two of them could hear.

A sun without any warmth lay across the sky. The black and white mixed colors revealed a deathly silence and nothingness.

This was the Young Emperor’s Immortal Style, a mysterious Immortal Style that came from an unknown origin.

Prince Jiu’s eyes were also burning with passion. He, who was the most unpredictable and as deep as an abyss, had finally revealed his strength at this moment.

An unknown and extremely suppressed aura, which seemed to be muddled and unclear, emerged like silk and mist.

“Although I can’t kill you in the Heavenly Realm, it’s not a bad choice to be able to add a heavy blow to your weak body.”

…

“It hurts …”

Jian Wushuang, who had lost consciousness, gradually regained consciousness as he felt the stream flowing beside him.

At this moment, half of his body was soaked in the stream, and most of his black clothes were torn.

He barely managed to support his body and fell to the ground, panting slightly.

His originally broken chest was rapidly healing. The lost Yan power and life force were also quickly recovering.

This was all thanks to Jian Wushuang’s Perfect Life Form characteristics.

As he cut off the past and achieved the Yan Immortal stage, his Perfect Life Form did not disappear. Instead, it became more and more powerful after entering the Great Yan Domain.
