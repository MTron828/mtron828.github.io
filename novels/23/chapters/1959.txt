1960 Thunderous Extermination

Then, the two Sir Gods came before Green Fire World.

“Big world? On this ancient battlefield, there’s a big world? How is it possible?”

“Could there be cultivators on this ancient battlefield?”

The two Sir Gods were terrified.

“What do you think? Do you want to head in to take a look?” A woman in green armor suggested.

“The ancient battlefield is so unique. After just ninety years, there are countless opportunities that have appeared, even cave dwellings left behind by experts in ancient times, there are as many as four! Until now, I didn’t hear anyone who said that they had found a big world. As we found it, we should, of course, take a look,” the other brawny young man replied.

The two of them made up their minds and immediately flew to Green Fire World.

However, before they got close to Green Fire World, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were a few figures that flew out from Green Fire World and appeared before two Sir Gods. They were led by Jian Nantian and Wang Yuan.

Green Fire World was located under the formation. Anyone who wanted to enter Green Fire World had to get permission from Green Fire Palace.

Through the formation, Green Fire Palace also noticed the two Sir Gods approaching ahead of time.

“Stop!”

Jian Nantian stared at the two people in front of him with a cold face.

“There are really cultivators?” The brawny young man and the woman in green armor were shocked.

Jian Nantian continued to say, “Green Fire World doesn’t like to deal with outsiders. Please leave now!”

“Green Fire World?”

The two Sir Gods were surprised but the brawny young man immediately flashed an ingratiating smile, “We don’t have bad intentions. We only want to rest in Green Fire World. I hope you don’t mind us.”

“No way. Leave this instant. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude,” Jian Nantian said in a deep voice.

“Rude?” The brawny young man sneered, “Only a few Real Gods. What can you do?”

“A few Real Gods have guts to block our way. You are courting death!” The woman in green armor looked cold. “Don’t waste time with them. Let’s barge in!”

“Alright,” the brawny young man nodded heavily.

They could tell that Green Fire World was unusual. However, a few Real Gods wanted them to back off. It was obviously not happening.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two Sir Gods took action straight away. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan and the others were shocked at the sight.

But just then…

“As you don’t want to leave, you may stay forever,” there was suddenly a cold roar that resounded in the air.

The voice contained boundless might and soaring murderous intention.

The two Sir Gods who were originally plunging at full speed suddenly stopped in the void.

“Whose voice is this?” The two Sir Gods creased their eyebrows.

Suddenly… Vroom!

There was an intense purple light that soared up and instantly covered the entire region.

A purple formation rose in the air from nowhere.

The brawny young man and woman in green armor could feel the tenacity of the purple formation.

The formation gave them an indestructible feeling.

Then, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Four resplendent golden lights suddenly burst out from afar.

The four golden lights were too fast. So fast that they were beyond the two Sir Gods’ imagination.

“Sh*t!!!”

The two Sir Gods’ faces changed when they saw the golden lights. They felt an intense danger soaring up from the bottom of their hearts.

Very soon, the four resplendent golden lights appeared in front of him.

They were four strange-looking golden swords.

“The golden swords…” the brawny young man stared.

He was also good with sword principle. Hence, he knew extremely well about the experts who were good with swords in Eternal Chaotic World.

He also knew about the golden sword.

“Sword Emperor!!! It’s Sword Emperor’s golden sword!!!” The brawny young man bellowed.

“What?” The woman in green armor next to him stared, “Sword Emperor?”

The infamous Sword Emperor? His golden swords were there?

On top of that, the purple formation around them reminded them of One Realm Pearl that Jian Wushuang once used. The method where one’s will formed a formation.

Suddenly, they found out who the person who had taken action against them was.

“No!!”

The two Sir Gods looked terrified. They wanted to resist and counter attack with their all.

However, they were trapped while Jian Wushuang’s four Hong Jun Golden Sword possessed the power of a Peak Emperor God each.

They burst out and the two Sir Gods didn’t even stand a chance to struggle. They were instantly killed.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared in the void from nowhere and stood next to the two Sir Gods’ dead bodies.

Behind him, Jian Nantian and the others came closer as well.

“It has been ninety years since the experts descended and there are people here already?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He knew that all experts had already descended and Green Fire World would definitely be found. It was only a matter of time.

However, it had only been ninety years and the first batch of experts had come.

“It was only two Sir Gods and I can easily kill them. They didn’t even have time to send out messages. However, if it were to be two Emperor Gods next or even more powerful experts, I wouldn’t have any other way. I can only do what I can do. I can only fight for more time for Green Fire World and also for myself!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

He was at the brink of a breakthrough.

Before the forces and experts in Eternal Chaotic World find out about Green Fire World, he would fight for however much time he could.

Because every extra year he got, or even an extra day, he would stand a higher chance to break through.

After he had retrieved the two Sir Gods’ treasure and shattered their dead bodies, Jian Wushuang had returned to Green Fire World to cultivate in seclusion.

However, he didn’t know that there was a young man with crimson hair in a crimson robe was hiding in the nearby void.

The young man with crimson hair in a crimson robe was naturally Sir God Xue Dao.

“Two top Sir Gods couldn’t even send any message out but were killed by Sword Emperors. Such a nuisance! Wasted my effort to lead them to Green Fire World,” Sir God Xue Dao muttered as chilliness filled his eyes.

Although he had stayed back in the void, he could see everything that had happened around Green Fire World.

“Jian Wushuang is so powerful. Even when an ordinary Almighty found Green Fire World, I reckon he would immediately kill the Almighty before the Almighty could expose the news to the public.”

“It looks like I have to instigate this personally. Even if I have to expose myself and be in danger, it will be worth it to get Sword Emperor targeted by all forces.”

Sir God Xue Dao smirked coldly and took out a token. He sent a message to an expert that he knew.

“Emperor God Shi Yu, I have a favor to ask.”
