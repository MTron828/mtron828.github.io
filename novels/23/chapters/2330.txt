Chapter 2331: In Ten Days

Jian Wushuang looked at the crowd strangely as they whispered amongst themselves.

“Lin Tiefeng gave them a pep talk.” Jian Wushuang smiled. Lin Yan beside him, on the other hand, was visibly moved by what Lin Tiefeng said. He felt that the Lin Family could face the Zhuge Family without fear. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But in reality, Jian Wushuang knew that the Zhuge Family had researched the Lin Family’s actual strength.

And they probably knew that the Thunder Sound Sect would help as well.

Even then, if the Zhuge Family dared to make a move, it meant that things were not as simple as they seemed.

But he did not know who was backing the Zhuge Family.

“Everyone, please do not leave the premises for now. If I am not wrong, they will attack in ten days,” Lin Tiefeng said.

“Ten days?”

“So fast?”

Immediately, there was a commotion in the hall.

“Brother Lin, how could you be so sure?” Zhuo Yunfeng frowned.

“Truth be told, the Zhuge Family finished their preparations three months ago. They delayed their plans till now as a bigshot arrived at Anjiu Commandery three months ago,” Lin Tiefeng replied. “The bigshot had the Commandery Governor come down to welcome the person himself, and I assume all of you know the Commandery Governor’s style.”

“The Commandery Governor has his own job to do. Normally he would turn a blind eye to feuds within the Anjiu Commandery, but if the Commandery Governor himself had to greet this bigshot, and the Zhuge Family attacked at that time, it would bring great shame to the Commandery Governor.”

Everyone finally understood.

Although the Commandery Governor was only a Chaotic Divine Demon, his title was indeed worthy of some respect.

After all, the Commandery Governor not only settled administrative affairs within the commandery, if there were experts in the commandery, he would recommend them to the sects himself.

Normally, the Commandery Governor would provide the genius with options. But if one sect were to offend him, they would likely never receive any genius from that region.

The Commandery Governor would not bother.

So, unless necessary, the sects within the Wusha Barren Region dared not offend the Commandery Governor.

If even the sects did as such, the Zhuge Family would not dare to offend the Commandery Governor.

“The Zhuge Family dare not make their move while the Commandery Governor entertains his guest, but according to our information, that person will leave the Anjiu Commandery in days. With the Commandery Governor’s character, he will likely continue to retreat back to his own abode, disregarding the feuds within the Anjiu Commandery. The Zhuge Family will make their move then,” Lin Tiefeng said.

“I see.” The people in the hall nodded.

“So, please make your preparations. The enemy will be here in days,” Lin Tiefeng said solemnly.

“Rest assured, Head, we will do our best,” the experts in the hall all replied.

...

At that same moment, the Zhuge Family was making their preparations as well.

In an exquisite attic, many experts from the Zhuge Family gathered, along with some people from the Dongzuo Sect.

However, as Lin Tiefeng had said, the Dongzuo Sect did not dare send too many experts to join the battle. Only one Chaotic Divine Demon and four Half Step Divine Demons were present.

The Chaotic Divine Demon, was the grey-robed elder beside Zhuge Hong, Elder Chen.

“According to news from the Lin Mansion, the experts from the Thunder Sound Sect have arrived. The Lin Mansion has paid a hefty sum to invite lots of experts as well,” a Zhuge Family elder said.

“Haha, we predicted this a long time ago,” a tall and sturdy middle-aged man with some stubble replied.

He was the Zhuge Family Head, Zhuge Yuanchong.

He had a white-haired elder beside him. He was the previous Zhuge Family Head, Zhuge Yun. He was the Chaotic Divine Demon that had reached Initial Success at Sword Principle, recognised as the top Sword Cultivator in the Anjiu Commandery. Of course, he had not yet encountered Jian Wushuang at that hime.

“Who is the Chaotic Divine Demon the Thunder Sound Sect sent?” Elder Chen asked.

“Fire Fairy,” Zhuge Yuanchong replied.

“Her?” Elder Chen’s brows lifted and he showed a playful smile. “That Fire Fairy was only a Thunder Sound Sect disciple twenty years ago, she made it to Chaotic Divine Demon levels through sheer luck.”

“She’s a normal Third Grade Divine Demon, small fry. According to what I heard, the Divine Demon that had been training outside has returned to the Lin Mansion. The Lin Mansion Head Lin Tiefeng is pretty strong as well, a peak Third Grade Divine Demon. He could go against you, Elder Chen,” Zhuge Yuanchong said.

“The last time I followed Young Lord Hong to the Lin Mansion, although Lin Tiefeng did not show himself, I could feel him. He was injured then. I wanted to lure him out, but that plan was messed up by a nobody junior,” Elder Chen said.

“That Jian Wushuang... Once we wipe out the Lin Family, he will have nowhere to escape,” Zhuge Hong said coldly as he sat on one of the chairs.

“That Jian Wushuang is gifted, so he must be killed. That has me thinking. Did the Lin Mansion not kill a Half Step Divine Demon from the Water Fairy Island? Why has the Water Fairy Island not acted upon it yet?” Zhuge Yuanchong frowned.
