Chapter 776: The Red Shade Sword Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Boundless Heaven Sword Art was invented by Palace Master Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang did not know which level this Secret Skill belonged to. He only knew that it was powerful.

The Boundless Heaven Sword Art was comprised of seven movements and each move was stronger than the previous one.

The first move was already terrifying, but the second move was several times more terrifying than it.

The third move was naturally more terrifying than the second move.

Jian Wushuang had lived in the Eternal Zone for 100 years. His Sword Principle had made a breakthrough, so did his Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

He had already mastered the third move.

The third move consumed an enormous amount of Spiritual Power. Once Jian Wushuang displayed it, it would cost him 40% of his Spiritual Power. Unless necessary, he would not display it. But now, he could only turn to this move to defeat the three monsters.

At this point, Jian Wushuang’s 15-meter figure held onto its longsword. A destructive power was gathering in his hands.

Sensing its terrifying power, Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream turned pale.

They even felt they were facing a deadly crisis.

At the same time, the power on the Emperor Sword peaked. After a blinding light shone across his eyes, Jian Wushuang swung his sword.

The third move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.?

This movement was named the Red Shade Sword Move!

With one swing, the heaven and earth quietened down.

Buzz… A vague sword shadow swept out, covering the whole sky like a wave.

Upon seeing this, Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream felt their scalps tingle.

“Quick, let’s work together to resist this attack.” Yun Fan roared.

Without hesitation, each of them took action at the same time.

Yun Fan brandished his long staff violently to display his strongest move again. Then, a 10,000-feet-long Burning Dragon lashed out.

As he was seriously injured, the Burning Dragon looked obviously paler than the last time.

Saber Master also unleashed the peerless blade light again.

With a swing, the sky darkened completely. In this endless darkness, only the saber shadow unleashed by Saber Master was left.

As for Old Weirdo Dream, she was not good at attacks. But at this moment, she also launched a brilliant sword shadow, whose power was nowhere near ordinary.

The three strikes slashed against Jian Wushuang’s huge sword shadow.

However, Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow was too powerful.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had defeated Yun Fan by only using the second move of Boundless Heaven Sword Art. The third move was multiple times stronger than the second move.

Therefore, even though Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream joined hands, they were unable to withstand it.

Peng!

An earthshaking loud boom was heard. It looked as if the Void had exploded.

Afterward, the strong waves spread outwards.

And in the center of the battlefield…

“Puff!” “Puff!” “Puff!”

Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream each spat out a mouthful of blood. Their bodies were sent flying backward, like cannonballs.

Owing to the diffuse wave power, the three experts suffered more injuries while retreating back. Yun Fan suffered the most. He had been badly injured when fighting Jian Wushuang alone. His injuries worsened just now because of the single strike, so he was unable to withstand the wave power.

? ? ?Several joints in Yun Fan’s body cracked at the same time, leaving many holes on his body. One of his arms was even cut off mercilessly.

Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream were also seriously wounded in the attack, although slightly better than Yun Fan.

Just when they were heavily injured, Jian Wushuang immediately turned into a shadow and charged forward.

His gaze was icy cold and he stared at Yun Fan deadly.

He wanted to kill them all, but he wanted to kill Yun Fan the most.

Furthermore, whoever suffered the greatest injuries would be easiest to kill.

Jian Wushuang’s first target was naturally Yun Fan.

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Yun Fan before the latter regained his balance. Jian Wushuang displayed Twilight, the fastest move of Secret Skills that he created. This caused a brilliant sword light to light up suddenly.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent was soaring, and there was a flicker of ruthlessness in his eyes.

The brilliant sword light shot towards Yun Fan’s head. Yun Fan was too feeble to react in time, so he was only able to watch it approach closer and closer.

“No!” Yun Fan widened his eyes and let out a forlorn howl.

The spectators’ eyes were glued onto the fight.

They wondered if the Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard would really die just like that.

When the sword light was half a meter away from Yun Fan…

Shua!

A cool breeze blew over and it seemed to have magic powers, as it sent the sword light and Jian Wushuang flying.

Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat nearly 100 meters before he regained his stance.

He narrowed his eyes and looked at the void ahead of him hurriedly.

The other experts also raised their head to look towards that direction.

They saw a figure slowly approaching at the skyline. He had his hands behind his back.?

The man was dressed in a white holy robe and he had two sword-shaped eyebrows on his handsome yet fierce-looking face.

He was composed as he walked over step by step. He was bathed in sunshine and looked as if he came from another world.

Everyone present could not help but stare at him.

He did not say a word. All he did was to walk towards them, but yet he still gained everyone’s full attention.

He finally stopped by Yun Fan’s side.

The whole area became deadly silent.

The only thing that was not calm was probably the raging emotions that everyone was hiding.

Yun Fan, who just had a narrow escape, also looked at him. With a great joy in his eyes, he immediately bowed to the man.

“Pay my respects to Palace Master!!!”
