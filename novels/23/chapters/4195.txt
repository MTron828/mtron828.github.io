4196 An Inquiry

“Hmph, it’s good that you admit it.” Upon hearing these words, a cold glint flashed across the eyes of Ruler Whitefloat as he sneered, “Jian Wushuang, let me ask you again. How did you escape from our Divine Son Qing Xuzi’s pursuit? Where is Divine Son Qing Xuzi now?”

As he said that, Ruler Whitefloat looked at Jian Wushuang with an oppressive gaze. It was as if he would be furious if Jian Wushuang gave a wrong answer!

“Back then, when Divine Son Qing Xuzi chased after me, I was forced to escape to a special place in the Tarot Ruins. There, I got rid of Divine Son Qing Xuzi. As for where he is now, I don’t know…” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“What a load of nonsense!”

Ruler Whitefloat did not wait for Jian Wushuang to finish his sentence. His voice suddenly became stern as he rebuked, “Jian Wushuang, I advise you to be more honest. Don’t try to be petty in front of me!”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

From the moment he stepped into the Supreme shrine, Ruler Whitefloat had not given him a good look. His words were full of scolding and oppression. Did he really think that he, Jian Wushuang, could be bullied?

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and said calmly, “Ruler Whitefloat, you can go and find out for yourself whether I’m telling the truth or not.”

“Still not being honest?” Ruler Whitefloat laughed out of anger as he mocked, “Jian Wushuang, since you said that you were in a secret place and escaped from our Divine Son Qing Xu’s pursuit, tell me, where is the secret place in the Tarot Ruins?”

After saying that, Ruler Whitefloat stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was silent for a moment and then said slowly, “I’ve forgotten.”

“You forgot? Hahahaha, what a good ‘forgot’!” Upon hearing these words, the corners of Ruler Whitefloat’s mouth curled up into an exaggerated sneer as he burst out laughing.

Everyone’s expressions turned ugly when they saw this. Even Supreme Gai Fu, who had been resting with his eyes closed, frowned slightly.

“Whitefloat, you’ve asked all your questions. Shouldn’t you be leaving now?” Ruler Blood Wave said, suppressing his anger.

Originally, he had allowed Ruler Whitefloat to enter the Divine Life Palace. It could be said that he had given great face to the Great Void Temple. In the end, Ruler Whitefloat did not know what was good for him and did what he did in the Supreme shrine. Did he have any scruples?

Jian Wushuang was the junior he had the most faith in, yet Ruler Whitefloat had threatened and berated him. This was no different from slapping the Blood Wave Ruler in the face!

“No rush.”

Ruler Whitefloat shook his head and sneered, “Jian Wushuang, since you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, then don’t blame me for bringing you back to the Great Void Temple and slowly interrogating you.”

After saying that, Ruler Whitefloat turned to look at the Ruler Blood Wave and the other two before saying in a clear voice, “The three of you, it seems that this disciple of the divine palace does not intend to explain things to me. Since that’s the case, let me bring him back to the Great Void Temple and slowly interrogate him. What do you think?”

Shua shua shua.

As soon as these words were spoken, Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Marquis Qingfeng instantly stood up and glared at Ruler Whitefloat.

“You dare?” The Ninth Kalpa King said coldly, his eyes extremely cold.

“You must be the Ninth Kalpa King, right? What, just because the outside world says that you’re comparable to a Supreme martial artist, you really think you’re a Supreme martial artist? Do you think you’re qualified to be impudent in front of this old man?” Ruler Whitefloat looked at the Ninth Kalpa King in disdain and said. He did not notice that Supreme Gai Fu, who was sitting at the head of the table, had already opened his eyes. Ruler Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe had extremely cold expressions on their faces.

However, even if he did notice it, he probably would not think much of it. The Divine Life Palace was the base camp of special life forms in the vast universe, so its strength was naturally not bad. However, the great void godly Palace was not bad either, and might even be stronger.

The Great Void Temple was founded by Divine Emperor Tai Xu and there were a total of seven Hall Masters. Each of these seven Hall Masters was a Supreme expert. Under the seven Hall Masters, there were seven Deputy Hall Masters and all of them were at the Supreme cultivation level.

He, Ruler Whitefloat, was the Deputy Hall Master of the seventh Hall of the Great Void Temple!

he was confident that even though Supreme Gai Fu, Ruler Blood Wave, and the others were stronger than him, they would not dare to offend him. after all, they would have to be wary of the Great Void Temple behind him.

But at this moment…

“How audacious! Who do you think you are? How dare you ask for someone from my Divine Life Palace?” Ruler Blood Wave’s eyes were filled with anger. “Whitefloat, I’m already giving you and the Great Void Temple face by letting you enter the Divine Life Palace to question Jian Wushuang. Now, you’re pushing your luck and want to take someone from my Divine Palace? What do you think this place is?

“Let me tell you, even if your Divine Son Qing Xu dies at the hands of my divine Palace’s disciples, he can only blame himself for not being strong enough. He brought this upon himself, understand?”

Upon hearing these words, Ruler Whitefloat’s face could not help but change slightly.

However, he did not reply. Instead, he looked at Supreme Gai Fu. He knew that Supreme Gai Fu was the one who could make the final decision here, not the Ruler Blood Wave or the Supreme Giant Axe.

He first cupped his hands toward Supreme Gai Fu, then said respectfully, “Supreme Gai Fu, you’re the head of the five lead Supremes of the Divine Life Palace, and you’re in charge of leading the Divine Life Palace on behalf of the palace Master. I don’t think you’re as impulsive as Ruler Blood Wave, right? That Jian Wushuang is merely a fourth stage Ruler. To us, he is no different from an ant. I believe you won’t become enemies with the Great Void Temple because of him, right?”

After that, he smiled and added, “Oh, that’s right. Divine Son Qing Xu is the beloved disciple of our first Hall Master. He’s above the Supreme martial artist. You have to think carefully about the implications of this.”

Supreme Gai Fu’s expression did not change at all when he heard this. He raised his eyelids and said indifferently, “Are you threatening this Lord?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ruler Whitefloat’s pupils contracted upon hearing this. For some reason, his heart suddenly thumped as a bad premonition welled up in his heart.

He braced himself and said, “Supreme Gai Fu, how would I dare to threaten you? I’m just explaining the implications of this matter to you. After all, he’s just a fourth-stage great Ruler. Why should we affect the relationship between the divine palace and the Great Void Temple for him? Supreme Gai Fu, I advise you to reconsider.”

After hearing the word ‘reconsider’, a faint smile appeared on Supreme Gai Fu’s aged face.

He looked at Ruler Whitefloat with a playful expression and said, “Do you know that even your first Palace Master, Bing Ye, has never dared to ask me to ‘think twice’ in front of me? You are just an insignificant Deputy Palace Master, and you dare to ask me to think twice?”

Ruler Whitefloat’s expression changed when he heard this. It was only then that he suddenly recalled that Supreme Gai Fu, who was sitting in front of him, was the most senior supreme in the universe. His strength had long since reached an unfathomable level.

“Supreme Gai Fu, I didn’t mean it that way…” He hurriedly explained.

Before he could finish, Supreme Gai Fu waved his hand.
