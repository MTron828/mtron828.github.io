Chapter 1993: Master Wu!

Jiu Jue Sword Mansion, in the broad void above.

“Tian Jian, how far away are we from the second sword stele?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not too far away. With our traveling speed, we will arrive in half an hour,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain said politely.

“Alright then. Let’s head over to the second sword stele,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain naturally obeyed.

As for the reason why Jian Wushuang didn’t fight with Master Wu to get the sword stele, the owner of Sky Sword Mountain didn’t ask even though he was curious.

Half an hour later, Jian Wushuang arrived at the second sword stele.

But Jian Wushuang only saw a barren land when he arrived. He didn’t see any sword stele.

“How could this be? When I left, the second sword stele was still towering here. Why did it disappear?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain creased his eyebrows.

“It seems like we are late,” Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly.

Master Wu had taken the first sword stele earlier.

Then, someone else had taken the second stele as well.

Then, there was only the third one left.

“Come on, let’s head over to the third sword stele.”

The three of them continued their journey and they soon arrived at where the third sword stele was located. It was also the last sword stele that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain knew of.

He was lucky enough. The sword stele was still towering there. Although there were people trying to pass the test to obtain the sword stele, they failed to do so.

“Sword Emperor, the person who sat for the test in the sword stele came out,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded. He saw a Sir God exited from the space whirlpool of the sword stele and he looked disappointed. He obviously hadn’t passed the test.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang walked towards the sword stele.

There were a few cultivators around the sword stele. They were looking at Jian Wushuang as he walked over.

Jian Wushuang arrived before the sword stele and prepared to enter the space whirlpool to sit for the test. Just then… Swoosh!

A figure plunged over from afar. In two simple flashes, he appeared next to Jian Wushuang and before the sword stele.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and looked at the person who came.

In a black robe, tall and brawny, carrying a broad and heavy sword. It was Master Wu that Jian Wushuang had seen not too long ago.

“Such a coincidence,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang already met Master Wu at the first sword stele. However, they didn’t have any contact then.

Then, as he arrived at the third sword stele, Master Wu rushed over too.

“The test in this sword stele, I’ll take it first. You can wait until I am done before you head out to try,” Master Wu said coldly in an indisputable tone.

“You first? Why?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but scoff at him.

The test in the sword stele couldn’t be taken by two people at the same time.

Only one at a time.

Under such circumstances, whoever headed in first would have the absolute opportunity.

Because if the first person passed the test, the sword stele would belong to him. What chance would the second person have?

Jian Wushuang had no alternative for the first sword stele.

But…

“Master Wu, everything in on the basis of time of arrival,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Time of arrival? I’m sorry, there is no such thing in my head. Speak with power. Get out of my way,” Master Wu bellowed and intended to take a stride forward.

Just then, there was a sudden gale.

Master Wu’s face grew grave. He realized that there was a shapeless sword intention that aimed at his skull. He hauled his footsteps.

Humph!

He humphed coldly and the sword intention instantly collapsed and dispersed.

Master Wu’s gaze was cold. He looked at Jian Wushuang like an ancient beast, “Jian Wushuang, your sword servant is not with you. With you alone, you are not my match. You’d better know where you stand. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise what?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “Master Wu, you think too highly of yourself.”

“You are courting death!” Master Wu was then raging in anger.

Hong!

There was a boundless sword intention that burst out like a tsunami.

The sea of sword intention filled the universe. The entire spacetime instantly froze.

Master Wu suddenly drew his sword in the middle of the sword intention.

The moment he struck the sword, it was as though the entire universe pressed down on Jian Wushuang.

The terrifyingly huge sword shadow extended its length across tens of thousands of miles in the sea of sword intention.

Master Wu who was at the eighth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, he either won’t attack, or he’ll attack with full force!

“The sword principle is pretty imposing,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but he didn’t panic.

The terrifyingly huge shadow that was tens of thousands of miles in length appeared before him and he pointed with his right index finger.

The Ancient God’s eighth finger, the Universe Finger!

One finger to shake heaven and earth!

Rumble. The void gradually collapsed.

Under the boundless divine power and power of ancient tribe bloodline, there was a huge finger than looked like it extended from ancient times in the collapsing void.

The very next moment, it collided directly with the terrifyingly huge sword shadow.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and everything in the world faded away.

The surrounding void shattered and the entire universe was lifted.

Just like the owner of Sky Sword Mountain, Sir God Mo Yu and the others, they scattered around long ago. Luckily, they had retreated earlier, otherwise the repercussions of their collision could easily have wiped them out.

Everything had become nothingness.

It was only the sword stele left towering there.

Although the repercussions of both attacks were fierce, it couldn’t damage the sword stele at all.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The five brilliant golden lights suddenly lit up. The five resplendent golden lights were like five shooting stars that struck across the void and appeared before Master Wu. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Master Wu looked cold as he wielded his broad sword continuously.

Every stroke contained hundreds of millions of jins that could easily break mountains and split rivers.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were five continuous clanging noises. All five Hong Jun Golden Swords under Jian Wushuang’s manipulation of divine power attacked.

Although Master Wu resisted the five continuous attacks, he couldn’t help but take one step back.

“Jian Wushuang, I belittled you. I never expected you to be so powerful after breaking through and becoming an Almighty. You live up to your reputation as an inverse cultivator. However, you must be dreaming if you want to win victory with power alone,” Master Wu’s voice was cold.

Just as he spoke, he raised the broad sword with both his hands at the same time.

Vroom vroom vroom. The terrifying extermination aura instantly concentrated on the broad sword.

The surrounding universe drowned in an extermination region.
