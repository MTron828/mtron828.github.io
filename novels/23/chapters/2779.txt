Chapter 2780: Jian Yi!!!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Blood Thunder King saw red.

The Grand Ultimate Gods under his command were extremely frightened.

On the other end, the Yin Su’er’s faction Grand Ultimate Gods were in a daze.

They were all prepared just now to greet Jian Wushuang’s domain oppression methods and the attack from Blood Thunder King and Sword Alliance’s experts.

As a result... They did not even make a move and the domain oppression methods did not suppress them. Instead, the Blood Thunder King and Sword Alliance camp were fighting among themselves.

“What’s the matter? Didn’t Sword Alliance team up with Blood Thunder King’s faction?”

“They declared that they are allies but now they are killing each other.”

“The Blood Thunder King’s faction was obviously not prepared, and they lost five Grand Ultimate Gods at once. Blood Thunder King would also probably be dead had he not have the life-saving method.”

“Sword Alliance... what the hell is going on?”

Those Grand Ultimate Gods in Yin Su’er camp were puzzled.

Of course, there were some of them that could tell what was going on. They turned to look at Yin Su’er.

Yin Su’er stood in the void and looked satirically at Blood Thunder King, she said, “Blood Thunder King, I told you not to be too happy too soon.”

“Have you and Sword Alliance... joined hands a long time ago?” Blood Thunder King’s eyes were gloomy.

“Yes, we joined forces much earlier than you think. I’ve started working together before Sword Alliance was established. Oh no, it’s Mr. Jian Yi,” admitted Yin Su’er.

Jian Wushuang was smiling faintly. He knew that after Yin Su’er exposed his name, his identity was no longer a secret.

However, there was no need to hide his identity anymore at that point in time. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Jian Yi? I seem to have heard of this name before.” Blood Thunder King frowned, raking his mind for the memory.

A Grand Ultimate God behind him immediately leaned forward and said a few words in his ear.

After that, Blood Thunder King’s expression changed abruptly.

“Jian Yi, the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, the Earth Ultimate God who was once on Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower wanted list?”

“So, you are Jian Yi?”

Blood Thunder King and the others were shocked. They were staring incredulously at Jian Wushuang.

All the other Grand Ultimate Gods who had heard of the bounty offered by Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower were amazed.

They were horrified and in disbelief not only because of the name Jian Yi...

The name, Jian Yi, acquired a certain reputation due to the bounty out on his head but that was not enough to gain the respect from those Grand Ultimate Gods.

A few decades ago, when Jian Yi was on Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect’s wanted list, he was just an Earth Ultimate God.

Although hearsay was that he had the combat power of a Heaven Ultimate God at that stage, he was indeed at the Earth Ultimate God realm.

How long had it been?

Perhaps, less than a hundred years?

Jian Yi disappeared, and when he reappeared again, things had changed drastically, he became the Sword Alliance Master, the leader of a top force in Danyang Continent.

Besides, he was extremely powerful; much stronger than many High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

Did he manage to grow so powerful in less than a hundred years?

“How is this possible?”

“Impossible!”

“Are you kidding me?”

Blood Thunder King, Yin Su’er and even a few members of Sword Alliance were all shocked to discover Jain Wushuang’s true identity.

That was incredible.

His rate of improvement was truly scary.

They probably had never seen such a genius in the entire Danyang Holy Domain who made such progress in less than a hundred years.

Even if they had to look in the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow, perhaps the most dazzling genius in the history of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion could barely be compared with Jian Wushuang.

Apart from that particular genius, there was no other in the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to smile when he noticed all the amazed gazes around him. “Yes, I am the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord Jian Yi!”

“So, he is the one!” Pandemonium broke out among the surrounding Grand Ultimate Gods.

“You are Jian Yi, then you are not from the Outer Realm?” Blood Thunder King stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course not. I was able to create a strong sword alliance in such a short period of time because I had a chance to gain a lot of resources and some special methods. Someone from the Outer Realm with the backing of an Undying Saint and a powerful force was just purely your wild guess,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“I have been cooperating with the Fort Master since a long time ago. I created the Sword Alliance only to help relieve the pressure on Crimson Stone Fort Master. As for the conflicts within Crimson Stone Fort, I naturally stand with the Fort Master. Just when I was worried about how to find a chance to strike a move, you came to me. I couldn’t ask for anything better.”

“Is that so?” The Blood Thunder King clenched his teeth tight, his face distorted by his terrine rage.

He thought that he managed to trick Jian Wushuang, Yin Su’er and Yun Shan all at once.

To his horror, on the contrary, Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er would set him up in a trap.

“Jian Yi, the Yun Shan faction has been defeated and they probably can no longer make a comeback. Next, we need to deal with Blood Thunder King’s faction. There is no need to talk nonsense with him, let’s just destroy him quickly. Otherwise, the top forces like Nanwu Palace would make their ways here real soon,” said Yin Su’er.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded, his eyes turned cold.

His mighty four oppression domains were still working perfectly on the battlefield, suppressing the opponents.

Blood Thunder King and his experts were completely enshrouded by the pressure of those four oppression domains, their expression looked extremely ugly under those agonizing pressure.

Initially, they had sixteen Grand Ultimate Gods, but five of them had just been killed with several others seriously injured.

Under such circumstances, they would be crushed even if Sword Alliance was after them., The Blood Thunder King faction would be wiped out completely if Sword Alliance and Yin Su’er stayed united.

“Sir, the situation is not good for us. Shall we withdraw?” a Grand Ultimate God under Blood Thunder King’s command suggested.

Blood Thunder King controlled the Crimson Stone Official Army, so he was also called the Army Lord.

Most of the Grand Ultimate Gods behind him are the Crimson Stone Official Army’s commanders.

“Withdraw? Haha, I have finally got this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, how can I miss it?” Blood Thunder King cracked into a crazy fit of laughter, his eyes turned extremely gloomy.
