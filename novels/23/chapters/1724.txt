Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang and He Xiu appeared in a gorgeous and brilliant Milky Way.

“This is the Milky Way and this is the base of the Lineage of Star.”

Jian Wushuang brought He Xiu along with him and walked in the stretch of Milky Way slowly. Along the way, he introduced the Lineage of Star to He Xiu continuously.

As He Xiu listened, he became extremely shocked.

Previously, he had grown up in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. Although he had heard of the Ten Sanctuaries, he had never really gone there before. It was not until then that he knew how prosperous the Ten Sanctuaries were and a Holy Kingdom could not be compared to them.

For example, the Lineage of Star was a huge monster to him and it was many times bigger and more powerful than the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu that he had been in previously.

As Jian Wushuang introduced the Lineage of Star, he also sighed with emotion.

It should be known that tens of thousands of years ago, when Lei Chao had brought him to the Lineage of Star for the first time, his expression had been the same as He Xiu’s.

In a flash, tens of thousands of years had passed. At that moment, he was one of the Hall Masters of the Lineage of Star and he was known for his mighty name in the Eternal Chaotic World. As for He Xiu, it was also unknown what he would become tens of thousands of years later.

In no time, Jian Wushuang brought He Xiu along with him and entered the base of the Lineage of Star for real. They then walked around randomly amidst the group of buildings.

Along the way, they came across quite a number of experts of disciples of the Lineage of Star.

When those people saw Jian Wushuang, they became extremely respectful.

“That’s Hall Master Wushuang, the most impressive genius in the whole history of the Lineage of Star!”

“Although Hall Master Wushuang is not an Almighty, he is still superior to Almighties. On the Real God ranking list, he is ranked first!”

Some older disciples were giving some introductions or bragging to the new disciples.

Of course, they also noticed the existence of He Xiu.

“Who is that person?”

“Hall Master Wushuang actually showed him the way personally? Even Star Palace disciples don’t have the right for him to do that, right?”

“This person should be Hall Master Wushuang’s disciple.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Disciple?”

At once, gazes which were filled with envy looked in the direction of He Xiu.

With Jian Wushuang’s current abilities and position, there were many disciples in the Eternal Chaotic World who were fighting to get him to be their Master. However, they did not have the luck for that to happen. In spite of that, He Xiu still became his disciple. As such, everyone else was jealous of him.

Jian Wushuang brought He Xiu with him and walked randomly around the Lineage of Star. During the walk, he gave some simple explanations regarding some of the places of opportunities as well as their uses. After that, he brought He Xiu with him and came to the cave that Hall Master Yuan lived in.

“Jian Wushuang, how did it go with the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?” Hall Master Yuan questioned straight away when he saw Jian Wushuang.

“Originally, it was very smooth. However, some changes occurred later on,” Jian Wushuang gave a simple explanation as to what had happened to the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

“Those dark powerhouses have actually set their eyes on the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes squinted, “What a pity. If you were given a longer period of time, your abilities would have risen greatly again.”

“It’s indeed a pity,” Jian Wushuang laughed helplessly.

“This little kid beside you is…?” Hall Master Yuan glanced at He Xiu.

“This is a little kid who I came across during my journey. He is called He Xiu and he is now my Registered Disciple,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes brightened. He knew about Jian Wushuang’s abilities. For someone to catch the eyes of Jian Wushuang and be accepted as his disciple, even if he were just a Registered Disciple, he would definitely be not too bad.

“I am He Xiu. Greetings to Hall Master Yuan,” He Xiu greeted him respectfully.

“This little kid’s talents are not too bad and he has already comprehended a small bit of the Power of Destruction. As for abilities, he should be able to get into the top fifty of the Universe God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Top fifty? Not bad, not bad,” Hall Master Yuan was beaming with joy.

It should be known that not just anyone could get into the Universe God ranking list. Although the Lineage of Star had genius disciples in the Universe God ranking list, there were so few of them that it was pathetic. For example, when Jian Wushuang was still a Universe God, excluding Jian Wushuang himself, there were only two other geniuses who were in the Universe God ranking list in the Lineage of Star.

Moreover, the two people did not have very high rankings. As for He Xiu, he already possessed the fighting capabilities to get into the top fifty of the Universe God ranking list when he had only just entered the Lineage of Star. After training for a period of time with the aid of the Lineage of Star’s resources, he would definitely be able to get into the top ten of the Universe God ranking list. Although his future could not be compared to Jian Wushuang’s, there was still a very high possibility of him becoming a top Chaotic Real God.

Such a kind of genius was exactly what the Lineage of Star had been looking for.

“The Lineage of Star’s rules are strict. Although you are Hall Master Wushuang’s disciple, the rules cannot be changed. Hence, you are currently a normal disciple of the Lineage of Star. In no time, there will be a battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace. Then, if you were to perform well, you could become a Star Palace disciple and obtain even more resources,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand,” He Xiu nodded his head.

“Alright, let me first get someone to bring you around,” Hall Master Yuan instructed an Elder to bring He Xiu around personally at once.

After He Xiu left, only Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Yuan remained in the cave.

“Hall Master Yuan, this time around, I obtained a special item from the outside. Can you help me take a look and tell me what it is?” Jian Wushuang took out the jade sword.

After Hall Master Yuan received the jade sword, he played with it in his hands for a while and his expression turned grave gradually.

“Jian Wushuang, where did you get this jade sword?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

Upon seeing Hall Master Yuan’s expression, Jian Wushuang understood that Hall Master Yuan already knew about the jade sword’s origin.

“This jade sword was given to me by He Xie,” Jian Wushuang gave an explanation regarding how the jade sword came about, as well as his experience in the You Ming Mountain.

“Sir God Dan Hong?” It’s actually Sir God Dan Hong’s cave?” Hall Master Yuan was shocked.

“Hall Master Yuan, could it be that you do not know about the appearance of Sir God Dan Hong’s cave?” Jian Wushuang was baffled.

“Of course I don’t know.” Hall Master Yuan shook his head and laughed, “Jian Wushuang, since you have joined the Sanctuary Alliance, you probably do not have a good understanding of some matters in the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance. The higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance refers to a group of Almighties and there are social circles within them. For example, experts who travel alone have a social circle with other experts who travel alone. As for people like us who come from powerhouses, we have our own social circle as well.”

“For Sir God Dan Hong’s cave appearing in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu which is outside the Sanctuaries, perhaps some of the Almighties in the Sanctuary Alliance have already known about it. However, they will not spread this piece of news intentionally. Moreover, Sir God Liu Yin has definitely come by to talk to them. For you to be able to get this piece of news from Sir God Mad Dog, it’s also thanks to luck.”

Jian Wushuang could not help laughing.

Indeed. If not for Sir God Mad Dog, he would also not know about the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

Sir God Mad Dog was an expert who travelled alone. Moreover, he was extremely strange. Hence, there were many ways for him to obtain information.

“Then this jade sword is…?” Jian Wushaung looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“If I am not wrong, this jade sword should be one of the keepsakes of the Blood Cloud Palace,” Hall Master Yuan said earnestly.
