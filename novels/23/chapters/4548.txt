4553 The Invincible Hell King

“What?”

The dog-headed human-bodied monster, who was holding a giant axe and was about to slash down, felt the cold Sword Intent that was locked on him and charging at him at high speed. He could not help but slow down and slowly turn his head to look.

“Huh?” The dog-headed monster let out a soft gasp, and his pupils could not help but shrink.

At the same time, Long Qing, Ninth Kalpa King, and many other people who were fighting all stopped their movements and looked up at the bright sword light that cut through Yin and Yang!

“This is?”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang is back!”

Countless people in the Divine Power Universe shuddered and exclaimed.

In the 5,000 years that Jian Wushuang fought, he conquered countless people with his own strength and made a great reputation for himself.

Swish!

In the blink of an eye, the Sword Light arrived with a loud bang and ruthlessly struck the dog-headed monster.

“Weak trash!”

Seeing this, the dog-headed monster laughed fearlessly. The long axe in his hand swept out and collided with the Tarot Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand!

Ding! Ding!

An extremely sharp explosion sounded. Immediately after, a huge shock wave spread out from where the two were fighting in a fan shape. The terrifying power it contained shattered the void and raised dust into the sky.

“Quickly retreat!”

The cultivators and Void Warriors who were fighting around them all changed their expressions and quickly retreated.

Immediately after, everyone saw that the muscular dog-headed human-bodied monster, who called himself ‘Hell King’, seemed to have been hit by a heavy hammer. His entire body drew an arc and shot out from the dust that filled the sky, his legs leaving two long traces in the void.

Gradually…

The smoke and dust gradually dispersed, revealing the figure of a black-clothed youth.

This young man was dressed in black and had black hair. His face was cold and indifferent, and his pale golden eyes were emotionless. The purple ‘Chuan’ character between his eyebrows was dazzling and flirtatious.

His five well-defined fingers held the Tarot Divine Sword, and a powerful sword pressure materialized. With him as the center, it spread out and suppressed all directions.

“It’s Jian Wushuang indeed!”

“Jian Wushuang has become stronger!”

“An Intermediate Supreme martial artist! Jian Wushuang had broken through to the Intermediate Supreme stage! What a fast cultivation speed!”

Instantly, countless people’s pupils shrank.

They could feel that Jian Wushuang was stronger than before. Not only was his cultivation stronger, but his entire person was also stronger.

The current Jian Wushuang was like a peerless divine sword that could tear the Nine Heavens apart. His eyes were filled with great pressure that no one dared to look at directly.

Jian Wushuang looked around indifferently and immediately saw countless familiar faces.

Ninth Kalpa King, the Overlord Patriarch, Moluo Yangu, Long Qing…

There were too many people who had grudges with him, and they were all injured and in an extremely miserable state.

“I’m back.”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with battle intent.

The battlefield was where he should be!

Then, Jian Wushuang tilted his head slightly and looked at Hell King.

Although Hell King was sent flying by Jian Wushuang’s sword, his aura did not weaken at all. The deep sword wound on his chest grew new flesh rapidly. In just a few breaths, he had recovered.

“Weak trash, do you know that you’re challenging a great existence?” Hell King said with a sinister smile, and an even more terrifying aura emanated from his body.

Sensing this aura, everyone’s expression changed. It was as if Hell King with a dog’s head and a human’s body had turned into the abyss of death.

“You’re noisy.” Jian Wushuang looked at him expressionlessly. Then, he turned into a golden light and charged at Hell King again!

A vast sword essence gushed out of Jian Wushuang’s hands. In an instant, Jian Wushuang and the Tarot Divine Sword disappeared.

In the world, only the sword light that broke through all darkness and brought dawn to the world remained!

It was domineering, fierce, and sharp. No words could describe this terrifying sword strike. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Life is a part of reincarnation, and your part has already ended.”

“Mortal Strike!”

Hell King roared and endless blue light gathered on the blade of his long axe. Then, he chopped down on Jian Wushuang!

This attack was far more powerful than the previous one. It could be said that it was already standing at the peak of the Half Invincible Supreme realm!

Rumble!!

As the two attacks collided, the heavens and earth shook as if countless worlds were collapsing.

An even greater shock wave spread out instantly, enough to annihilate hundreds of stars in an instant.

People from both universes who were fighting around them retreated again. A Three Scar Void Master was just one step slower and was crushed into powder by the aftermath of the battle between Jian Wushuang and Hell King.

Jian Wushuang’s right hand, which was holding the sword, trembled. The power of the axe was enough to blow up the sun. Even with his chaotic domineering body, he still felt a little tired.

And this was not the most important thing.

The most important thing was that Hell King’s axe seemed to have devouring power. At the moment of the fight, it wanted to devour Jian Wushuang’s life force and cultivation.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang was a Perfect Chaotic Life Form. He only needed to circulate his divine power slightly to suppress the devouring power.

...

“Oh? He actually blocked it? It seems like you’re stronger than those ants.” Hell King squinted his eyes, and a slightly surprised look appeared on his face.

However, the next moment, his lips curled into a deep and sinister smile.

“However, in front of me, you’re just a slightly stronger ant. It can’t change your weak nature!”

“Mortal Strike!” Countless rays of blue light gathered on the blade of the long axe in Hell King’s hand and he hacked down at Jian Wushuang!

“You’re too slow.” Jian Wushuang sneered and immediately activated the secret skill of Dragon blood. His speed suddenly increased by ten times and in a flash, he appeared behind Hell King. The Sword Qi of the Tarot Divine Sword in his hand burst forth and he slashed at Hell King’s head!

“Open Sky!”

“Annoying trash, do you only know how to sneak attack?” Hell King frowned. Speed was indeed his weakness.

However, he also had a way to deal with it.

Clang!

He first raised his long axe to block the sword strike, then took a step forward to put some distance between him and Jian Wushuang.

In the end, he raised his right hand, pointed it at Jian Wushuang, and said, “Void technique, Withering Rhythm!”

...

As soon as he finished speaking, countless blue lights gushed out of the void and gathered in his palm, forming a blue vortex.

The next moment, the blue light rushed out of his palm and pierced into Jian Wushuang’s body.

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang’s speed slowed down and his aura began to decline. Like a flower bud in the autumn wind, it gradually withered.
