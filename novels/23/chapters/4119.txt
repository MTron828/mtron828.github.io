4123 In Front of the Trial Field

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

In an attic in the sixth mountain range, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. A magnificent pressure exploded with him at the center, and then immediately withdrew into his body.

“After ten days, I can finally control the divine power in my body.” Jian Wushuang smiled. After the baptism of the Life Nirvana Pool, not only had his Divine Body increased by 68,000 miles, but his divine power was also much stronger, even he was unable to control his divine power in the first place.

It took him ten days to perfectly control the strength of his divine power and suppress it to about 8,000 times.

“The harvest from this trip to the Life Nirvana Pool is too great. My strength is much stronger than before.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself with a hint of amazement on his face. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the past ten days, not only had he completely controlled his skyrocketing strength, but he also knew his two innate divine abilities like the back of his hand, he believed that with these two innate divine abilities, he would be able to protect himself even against a Supreme-being.

Of course, he could only rely on his innate divine abilities to protect himself.

“Now, it’s time to go to the appointment.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed coldly. The Ninth Kalpa King wanted to step on him to prove his strength, which was exactly what he wanted. He could use the Ninth Kalpa King’s hand to see how powerful he was after his baptism, how powerful he was!

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang flashed and disappeared into the attic.

“Husband.”

Outside the attic, Leng Rushuang and Ruler Blood Wave were already waiting for him.

“Shuang ‘er.” Jian Wushuang glanced at his wife.

Ten days ago, when he returned, he had already told Leng Rushuang about his appointment with the Ninth Kalpa King.

However, it was only a sparring match in the trial ground, not a life-and-death battle, so Leng Rushuang was naturally not worried.

“Senior Blood Wave.” Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully to Ruler Blood Wave again.

“Ten days have passed. How are your preparations?” Ruler Blood Wave asked with a smile.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You should have read the information on Ninth Kalpa King. Are you confident in fighting him?” Ruler Blood Wave asked again.

“According to the information, his strength was almost 20 chaos cycles ago. During these 20 chaos cycles, Ninth Kalpa King barely fought. I don’t know how much his strength has increased during these 20 chaos cycles.”

“If he was 20 chaos cycles ago, I’m 100% sure that I can win against him.”

“But if he makes a big breakthrough in his strength during these 20 chaos cycles, then I’m not absolutely sure that I can win.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“If I’m not sure, then I’m more or less sure that I can win?” Ruler Blood Wave looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Indeed, the Ninth Kalpa King might be very strong, but Jian Wushuang was also absolutely confident in his own strength.

In the trial field, both of them maintained the same realm, which was the third-level Ruler realm. In terms of strength, he was definitely stronger than the Ninth Kalpa King.

In terms of comprehending the universal principles, he had long been able to pass the fifth level of the principle sea. Later, he studied the Purple Blood Secret Manual and reached the first level. He was even very close to the sixth level of the principle sea.

At the same time, he also awakened two innate divine abilities. In addition to the original universe given by the universe principles, there were three innate divine abilities.

Moreover, the universe principles also gave him a strong will power.

All these things added together, he really did not believe that anyone in the same level could be his opponent. Even though the Ninth Kalpa King was an Ultimate Ruler, he was not afraid at all.

Even if the Ninth Kalpa King had made a great breakthrough in his strength in the past 20 chaos cycles, Jian Wushuang was still more than 90% confident that he could defeat him in a head-on fight!

“Judging from your smile, it seems that victory is in your hands.” Ruler Blood Wave smiled as well. “Alright, come with me. Don’t let them wait too long.”

“Them?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Haha, the Ninth Kalpa King has already sent people to spread the news of your battle. Now, many people in the Life Palace know that you fought with him on the trial field today. The battle between two perfect lives will naturally attract many people. As far as I know, even many ancient existences in the palace are very concerned about your battle.”

“So, you must perform well in this battle. Don’t let the nine disasters steal the limelight,” Ruler Blood Wave said with a smile.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood and then smiled. “Since so many people will pay attention to this battle, I won’t let them down.”

Immediately, Jian Wushuang was led to the trial field by Ruler Blood Wave.

...

An ancient cyan temple stood alone in a corner of the Life Palace.

The Cyan Temple was where the trial field of the Life Palace was located.

The Cyan Temple did not look big on the outside, but in fact, it contained a vast trial space, let alone a Ruler, even two Supreme experts could fight freely in the trial space.

Of course, whether they were Rulers or Supreme experts, they only entered the trial space with their divine bodies condensed by consciousness. As for their original bodies, they remained in the outside world.

At this moment, the green temple was crowded with people. They stood in the void, revealing their auras and discussing in low voices.

“Have you heard? Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body expanded to 68,000 miles in the Nirvana Pool! It’s the record in the history of the Life Palace!”

“Haha, it’s said that he has awakened his innate divine power. Jian Wushuang is indeed very talented. I dare to say that once he breaks through to the Supreme realm, he will become another pillar of the Life Palace.”

“But...

“He is still too immature and arrogant. He actually dared to agree to the challenge of the Ninth Kalpa King. He really doesn’t know himself.”

“Jian Wushuang is indeed reckless.”

Many people shook their heads as they spoke. They sighed at Jian Wushuang’s high talent and expressed their incomprehension and irrationality about the fight between Jian Wushuang and the Ninth Kalpa King.

They did not know much about Jian Wushuang. They only knew that he was a perfect life, that his Divine Body had grown to a height of 68,000 miles in the Life Nirvana Pool, and that he had awakened his talent and supernatural power. However, they did not know anything else.

After all, Jian Wushuang had just entered the depths of the universe and was not well-known in the universe.
