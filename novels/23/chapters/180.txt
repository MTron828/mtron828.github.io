Chapter 181: Spirit Locking Spell

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Blood debts must be repaid in blood!”

The cold words made Jian Wushuang look awe-inspiring.

“Master Wushuang,”Dan Jiu suddenly said in the courtyard, “several assassins from Blood Feather Tower have called for help with Symbiotic Insects just now. It won’t take long for a large number of experts from Blood Feather Tower to arrive, so we’d better leave as soon as possible.”

“You are right.” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately looked at Jian Nantian, “Father, let’s go.”

“Go?” Jian Nantian shook his head slowly, “You can go, but I won’t.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

Dan Jiu, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were also astonished.

They came to save Jian Nantian, and now they had managed it. However, Jian Nantian didn’t want to leave.

“Father...” Jian Wushuang was just about to say something, but he was interrupted by Jian Nantian.

There was a bitter smile on Jian Nantian’s face, “It’s not that I don’t want to leave, but I can’t.”

After that, Jian Nantian rose to his feet and walked towards the gate of the courtyard. He stopped at the gate, and then slowly touched the space in front of him.

There immediately appeared several transparent ripples in the area he touched.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Spirit Locking Spell!” Dan Jiu immediately exclaimed.

“Oh?” Jian Nantian looked at Dan Jiu, and then said with a smile, “Yes, it’s the Spirit Locking Spell, so I can’t leave.”

“Huh ~ ~” Dan Jiu breathed lightly and said lowly, “I never thought that the Blood Feather Tower paid so much attention to you, Mr. Jian Nantian. They not only arranged so many Yin Void Realm experts to watch over you, but even used the Spirit Locking Spell on you!”

“What is this Spirit Locking Spell? What the hell is going on?” Jian Wushuang asked in succession.

“Master Wushuang, I’m afraid that you can’t take your father away this time,” Dan Jiu said solemnly, “It seems that this courtyard is a common one, but it is surrounded with a Spirit Locking Spell, which is used to detain those who have special positions.”

“Spirit Locking Spells can be started with just a drop of blood. Once initiated, it will restrict the owner of the blood. Unless the Spirit Locking Spell is removed, anyone trapped by it is unable to leave its scope.”

“Bluntly, it is same as any other trap. But, in other traps, once it is activated, no one can enter or leave. This trap is different in that the Spirit Locking Spell only aims at one person...”

“Us, those of the Nine Emperors Sect, and the experts of Blood Feather Tower can enter and leave the Spirit Locking Spell whenever we want. Only your father is trapped. Because Blood Feather Tower evoked the Spirit Locking Spell with his blood, your father is restricted by the spell and unable to leave.”

“So that’s it.” Jian Wushuang immediately got it.

No wonder his father was trapped in this courtyard, instead of secret chambers or jails. This courtyard was ever harder to escape from than a jail.

“Mr. Dan Jiu, you said that the Spirit Locking Spell can be deactivated just now. How can it be deactivated?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A Spirit Locking Spell can indeed be deactivated, but it requires great strength. Normally, only supreme experts who have reached the legendary realm can deactivate a Spirit Locking Spell,” Dan Jiu said.

“What’s the legendary realm?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Divine Transcendence!” Dan Jiu said directly.

Jian Wushuang was immediately shocked.

The Way of Martial Arts, the Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, The Spiritual Sea, The Gold Core Realm, The Yin-Yang Void Realm, and Divine Transcendence!

Among them, the Yin-Yang Void Realm was regarded as the peak level in Tianzong Dynasty. However, there was a higher level above the Yin-Yang Void Realm, which was the legendary Transcendental Realm.

That Realm was Divine Transcendence.

However, supreme experts were rare!

Tianzong Dynasty had undergone thousands of years of history, but there was only one who had truly reached the level of Divine Transcendence.

He was the founding emperor of the Tianzong dynasty, and the creator of the Formless Sword Art.

But the founding emperor vanished shortly after founding the Tianzong Dynasty. Even now, no one knew whether he was dead or alive.

Could this Spirit Locking Spell only be deactivated by a supreme expert at the legendary level of Divine Transcendence?

“How could this be?”

“How could this be?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression immediately became pale, and his figure trembled slightly, with an unwilling look in his eyes.

Of course, he was quite unwilling.

Since his father went missing, he had been eager to find his father’s whereabouts. Seven years had passed, he finally found his father, and he immediately invited experts from everywhere to come help rescue his father.

They even defeated the Nine Emperors Sect.

And they also stopped the assassins from Blood Feather Tower with the help of Wang Yuan.

He finally saw his father. But he did not expect that his father still couldn’t leave because of the Spirit Locking Spell.

“No wonder that the Blood Feather Tower assassins said that Master Wushuang was doomed to return without accomplishing anything. It turns out they were right.”Dan Jiu sighed secretly.

“Wushuang.”

Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou also looked at Jian Wushuang with a sort of frown at this moment.

“Shuanger.”

Jian Nantian appeared at the side of Jian Wushuang, patting his shoulder, and said, “Glad to see you today. I’m very satisfied with your progress. But if you want to rescue me, your current strength is not enough.”

“Come to rescue me after you break through to the legendary realm.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was in a shock.

“Reach that step?”

Seeing this, Ma Qinghai and his son Ma Changfeng couldn’t help sneering, “Jian Wushuang, you attacked my Nine Emperors Sect with your comrades. Indeed, the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect and Blood Feather Tower couldn’t stop you, but if you want to rescue your father, it is impossible.”

“Asshole!” Jian Wushuang looked at Ma Qinghai coldly, with a rising killing intent.

Now he really wanted to kill this person.

However, when he was about to fight, Jian Nantian stopped him.

“Let me deal with these two,” Jian Nantian said calmly.

“Father?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

While Jian Nantian standing in front of the stone table, he picked up the wooden sword lying on the table, and then slowly walked towards Ma Qinghai and Ma Changfeng.

This scene astounded not only Jian Wushuang, but also Dan Jiu, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou.

“What does he want to do?” Dan Jiu couldn’t help murmuring.

It seemed that Jian Nantian was going to fight.

But Jian Nantian’s Dantian had been destroyed. Without a Dantian, he would have no spiritual power. Now he was just an ordinary person who had no Spiritual Power at all.

However, between Ma Qinghai and Ma Changfeng, one was at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, which was almost strong enough to be on the Earthly Dragon List, and the other one was a powerful warrior in the Initial Yin Void Realm.

At this moment, Jian Nantian just took an ordinary wooden sword and walked towards the father and son.
