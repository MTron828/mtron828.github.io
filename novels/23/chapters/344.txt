“Since you have decided, I won’t say anything.”

Wine Master looked at Jian Wushuang with a serious face. Then he took out two Golden Purple Light Beads, which seemed ordinary but contained an enormous attack power.

“What are they?” Jian Wushuang looked at him in surprise and asked.

“They are Demonic Grenades. I got them by chance.” Wine Master said, “This small bead holds an enormous power with a sophisticated operation method. As long as it recognizes you as its owner, you can detonate it with your mind.”

“I tested one once, and the power it released shocked me. If used properly, a Demonic Grenade can threaten even a pinnacle Saint Realm expert. The remaining two are yours. Consider it a gift, in honor of our relationship.”

“Thank you so much,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

He took the Golden Purple Light Beads and held them in his hands tightly. After sensing the power of the Demonic Grenades, cruelty rose in his eyes.

“When will you set off?” Wine Master looked at him and asked.

“Now,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

Wine Master nodded and said, “Make sure you are prepared.”

“Please take care of them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t worry. Experts from Alchemy School will look after them,” Wine Master said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded. He looked at Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou once more, then he took a deep breath and departed.

After getting the three of them situated, Wine Master also left, heading in the direction that Jian Wushuang had gone.

...

In an ancient, vast, and majestic mountain range.

At the very center of the mountain range, a giant mountain rose, at least a thousand feet high. It was known as the Skyward Mountain.

A black-clothed young man, Jian Wushuang, was standing at the top of Skyward Mountain with a long sword on his back. Then he sat down and took out several Interspatial Rings.

He got them from the seven Saint Realm experts of Holy Emperor Palace.

After he killed them and took their Interspatial Rings, he had not had a chance to carefully inspect them until now.

Seven Interspatial Rings in total. He began checking them one by one.

He had to admit that the seven Saint Realm experts from Holy Emperor Palace, who had all comprehended Domain, each had a large number of valuable assets that even included some rare treasures.

Elixirs, manuals, and magic weapons as well.

Among the treasures, there was one that even surprised him.

He found a big black bow. Though there were no arrows with it, its power was still terrifying.

“God-killing Bow!”

Seeing it, Jian Wushuang felt surprised and happy.

This God-killing Bow was a magic weapon, a second-grade magic weapon!

Different from other magic weapons, the God-killing Bow could gather a large amount of killing power in a matter of seconds. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Nice.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Mo Yun’s Interspatial Ring really had something good.”

But it still took time to gather power. That’s why he didn’t use it when he fought with Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang was too fast, so he didn’t have enough time.

Now, it belonged to Jian Wushuang.

“The Demonic Grenades, God-killing Bow, and my other means should give me a slim chance of survival.” Jian Wushuang believed he had a chance.

The fight was unavoidable as long as the Blood Soul Mark stayed on him!

His cloned body was destroyed and the new one hadn’t formed yet. Therefore, he couldn’t secretly replace himself with a clone.

There was also no one helping him. He could only rely on himself.

On top of the giant mountain, Jian Wushuang was sitting cross-legged. Then he closed his eyes slowly. His breath became steady and his mind calmed down. Half a day quickly passed.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, which were full of determination.

“Everything is ready!”

“Both my strength and mind are in a perfect state.”

“I have exhausted all my means and prepared five Killing Moves!”

“Holy Emperor Palace... no matter who you send, with the help of these five killing moves, I will be capable of fighting with them head-on!”

Rumble~

A devastating aura rose and surged, causing the whole area to tremble.

In the long mountain range, Jian Wushuang wasn’t the only one present. There were many experts hiding in the surrounding areas, waiting quietly.

News had spread since the battle in Ice Nether Valley a few days ago.

And, Jian Wushuang was at the eye of the storm because of the Blood Soul Mark.

Everyone knew that Holy Emperor Palace wouldn’t let him off.

They would definitely send one of their Holy Masters to kill him.

So there would definitely be a fierce fight.

Therefore, many of them were waiting, filled with expectations.

They wanted to see whether Jian Wushuang, a rare genius, would once again be able to create a miracle during this life and death crisis.

They had been following and watching him since he left Ice Nether Valley. Now, with Jian Wushuang at the top of Skyward Mountain, it was obvious that others would be here too.

The surrounding area was abuzz with discussion.

“It seems he is going to make his stand here!”

“Because of the Blood Soul Mark, there is no choice but to fight them to the death!”

“If they want to make sure he has no chance to survive, Holy Emperor Palace will have to send out a Holy Master to deal with him.”

“Which one will come?”

Many experts were standing in the surrounding area, waiting quietly. Then, one day later.

A slender elder in a black robe slowly appeared from off in the distance.

He walked slowly, but with each step, he seemed to move a thousand feet.

In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at the center of the mountain range. Floating in front of the Skyward Mountain, he looked down at Jian Wushuang.

As soon as the slender elder appeared, the experts in the surrounded turned to face him.

They were all dumbfounded.

“He is... Second Holy Master.”
