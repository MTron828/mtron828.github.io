Chapter 784: Three Senior Brothers

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Silence!

The whole world seemed to have become soundless.

All the experts were watching the three unexpected arrivals with bated breath and felt the fierce aura they emitted.

Compared to these three men, Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, Demon Master Su looked quite inferior.

“Dao, Dao Masters?”

“Another three Dao Masters?”

“For heaven’s sake, what is going on today? How come so many Dao Masters have suddenly appeared?”

The surrounding experts’ insides squirmed violently with anxiety.

Dao Masters, supreme experts of the Eternal World, were utterly legendary figures in the Firmament Territory.

Usually, it would be extremely hard to meet a single supreme expert. But now, there were no less than six Dao Masters standing here.

Six Dao Masters!

And they also heard how the last three Dao Masters addressed Xuan Yi.

Master!

They called Xuan Yi master!

Thus, their identities were evident.

“The three men are all disciples of Xuan Yi?”

“Didn’t they say that Palace Master Xuan Yi didn’t recruit any disciples before he met Jian Wushuang?”

“No, he had three disciples before that. But the three disciples left the Firmament Territory a long time ago to make a name for themselves in other realms.”

“All his three disciples are Dao Masters?”

They were stunned!

Everyone on the battlefield was stunned by this discovery.

They knew Xuan Yi was powerful, mysterious, and intimidating. But it never occurred to them that Xuan Yi’s disciples could become so freakishly powerful.

Yes, freakishly powerful!

Weren’t Dao Masters hard to come by?

But Xuan Yi had three personal disciples before Jian Wushuang, and these three personal disciples had all become Dao Masters!

He must be a monster!

It was simply unbelievable.

Even if he had an exceptionally strong Dao Master teach them himself, he could not guarantee that his disciples would grow into Dao Masters, could he?

“Xuan Yi!”

The experts of the three magnates all looked very sullen.

Yun Fan’s face was rather pale.

Those experts of the three magnates knew a little about what Xuan Yi could achieve. They had long since learned that Xuan Yi had raised several formidable disciples.

Throughout the history of the Ancient Sect, as well as the Sect Master, there had been three Dao Masters. This allowed the Ancient Sect to be the most prestigious of all the sects of the Firmament Territory. After all, even the three magnates had not produced any Dao Masters other than the Palace Masters. Only the Ancient Sect had done so, and they had a total of three Dao Masters.

But the three magnates knew very clearly that the three Dao Masters who had come from the Ancient Sect shared one thing in common—they were all personal disciples of Xuan Yi!

Precisely because of this, they were shocked when they heard that Xuan Yi was going to take in Jian Wushuang as his fourth personal disciple. This was why they planned to kill Jian Wushuang in advance, and they attempted to do so in the Eternal Zone.

The three magnates were scared!

They feared that Xuan Yi might raise another Monster, another Dao Master. That would be a huge blow to them.

However, things went contrary to their wishes. Jian Wushuang did not die under their attack. Instead, he attained great opportunities in the Eternal Zone and elevated his strength to an unimaginably high level within a mere hundred years.

Compared with the power that his three Senior Brothers showed at the beginning, what Jian Wushuang had demonstrated was much more extraordinary.

“Damn Xuan Yi, he is well prepared for this. He must have long since summoned his three personal disciples back!” Tian Yunzi cursed. He was glum-faced, his eyes fixed on the three Dao Masters who had just arrived.

“This is getting tricky. His three personal disciples have returned. It’s impossible for us to attack him now,” Emperor Tu said.

“We probably can’t even escape unscathed, let alone attack him.” Demon Master Su’s face grew slightly ugly. She noticed that each of the three newly arrived Dao Masters was issuing a rich aura, especially the evil scarlet-haired youth who was the last to come.

This evil scarlet-haired youth gave her a deathly still feeling like the blood sea, and she could not help but be awestruck.

In the Void, Xuan Yi looked around at the three men and nodded, gesturing them to stand up.

“Jian Wushuang, come here.” Xuan Yi beckoned Jian Wushuang over.

“Master.” Jian Wushuang immediately came over.

“As I told you before, you have three Senior Brothers. And here they are. Let me introduce them one by one.” Xuan Yi started to introduce his disciples.

“This is your Third Senior Brother, Bai Hu, who is also quite famous in the Eternal World. People call him Dao Master Bai Hu!” Xuan Yi pointed a finger at the brown bear-like burly man with a pair of huge eyes.

The burly man gave a good-natured smile at Jian Wushuang and asked, “You’re the new Junior Brother our master has recruited?”

“I, your Junior Brother, hereby pay my respects to my Third Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang answered immediately, memorizing the name of his Third Senior Brother.

“And this is your Second Senior Brother, Purple Mountain. But others usually call him Purple Dragon Dao Master. That Giant Dragon is his ride,” Xuan Yi said, pointing at the purple-armored man standing on the head of the Giant Dragon like an unrivaled War God.

“Second Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang greeted him at once.

“Yeah.” Second Senior Brother Purple Mountain nodded slightly at Jian Wushuang, his eyes exuding a trace of warmness.

“And this one is your First Senior Brother. His name is Xue Lingtian. Few people know this name. But if you mention the title ‘Master Blood Saber’, all the top experts in the Eternal World shall know who you’re referring to,” Xuan Yi said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang instantly looked at the demonic youth with blood-red hair who was also in a blood-red robe.

The demonic youth also looked straight at Jian Wushuang. When Jian Wushuang looked into this man’s eyes, he felt that he was simply staring at a boundless blood sea, and nothing more.

Jian Wushuang was a bit shocked. He hastily gave a salute. “Pay my respects to First Senior Brother.”

“Junior Brother, no need to be so polite to us.” The evil scarlet-haired youth nodded at Jian Wushuang.

After introducing everyone, Xuan Yi opened his mouth and said, “I called you back with such short notice this time because your Junior Brother got into some troubles and needs your help. You three will help him deal with the three Dao Masters from the three magnates.”

“The three magnates?”

The evil scarlet-haired youth, that was to say Jian Wushuang’s First Senior Brother Xue Lingtian, cast a glimpse at Tian Yunzi and the other two, and a note of ruthlessness flitted across his eyes. Then, he asked, “Junior Brother, what do you reckon we should do with this three?”

“Do with?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback. They were talking about the three Dao Masters. How could he decide what to do with them?

“Just teach them a lesson, but don’t kill them.” Xuan Yi said.

“Got it.” Xue Lingtian nodded.

At Xuan Yi’s words, Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su instantly became indignant, flames of fury dancing in their eyes.

They were three Dao Masters. But judging by Xuan Yi’s words, they were already like three fish lying on a board for them to chop. It was natural that they were indignant.
