Chapter 2584: Levy

Hum!

It was just a simple movement where both figures crossed before Jian Wushuang returned to his original spot. His aura soon subsided along with the surrounding world which quieted down.

“Master Inspector, thanks for taking it easy on me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

However, the purple-robed man was evidently in a paranoid!

He had lost!

He was a High-level Earth Ultimate God who wanted to teach Jian Wushuang a lesson but was almost instantly defeated.

It happened too fast and too miserably.

The tyrannical sword thrust which pierced through the world would have attacked him had Jian Wushuang not been lenient earlier. The matter of being able to resist and being able to survive the sword attack were two different concepts after all.

“This kid...” The purple-robed man stared at Jian Wushuang with an extremely gloomy look.

Behind him, the two Primary-level Earth Ultimate Gods who came with him were exchanging looks of shock.

They were dumbfounded when they received news that a mere Peak Ultimate God Jian Wushuang had killed San Shouwang.

There was a massive gap between Peak Ultimate Gods and Earth Ultimate Gods and such occurrences were just too uncommon. A genius of that level would not be interested in the Territorial Lord position hence they were doubtful of the news when they first received it.

However, the truth laid before their eyes.

Jian Wushuang was not only capable of defeating a Primary-level Ultimate God but also a genuine High-level Earth Ultimate God!

“Master Inspector, I don’t know if you’d approve of my strength? Otherwise, we can continue fighting.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The purple-robed man twitched his face. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

‘Continue fighting?’

He had belittled Jian Wushuang’s strength in the battle earlier and was careless. However, Jian Wushuang’s instant power boost frightened him and proved he was indeed the stronger one. Jian Wushuang was so much stronger than himself.

He would simply be looking for trouble if he chose to continue fighting.

As for the approval...

Although the purple-robed man was extremely unwilling, he had no choice but to produce an Interspatial Ring. “This is your appointment letter and Territorial Lord Token. You’ll be the new Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord from today onward.”

The purple-robed man threw the token at Jian Wushuang before glancing at the two people behind him and said, “Let’s go!”

“Master Inspector, farewell.” Jian Wushuang smiled and watched the purple-robed man and his entourage leave.

The smile on Jian Wushuang’s face disappeared upon the departure of the three before he peeked into the Interspatial Ring in his hand.

Using his soul power to scan the ring, he found an appointment letter and a token within.

Neither the appointment letter nor token was named, so Jian Wushuang had to do it himself.

“Master!”

Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng who were at the edge of the field stepped forward.

“Congratulations, Master for becoming the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord!” Xiao Tiexin exclaimed with joy.

“Territorial Lord.” Cang Heng saluted with a bow.

“I’ve managed to get the Territorial Lord position but offended the inspector just now,” sneered Jian Wushuang.

“Hmph, he deserves it. How could he use his inspector position and High-level Earth Ultimate God powers to reap benefits from you? How crazy was he?” Xiao Tiexin said.

Jian Wushuang had beheaded San Shouwang who was also a High-level Earth Ultimate God.

San Shouwang was powerful and in fact at least much more powerful than the Inspector.

Of course, the inspector would not be spared when even San Shouwang was annihilated by Jian Wushuang.

“I’m to be blamed for this. The Inspector may not have acted so rashly to persecute you had I told Crimson Stone Fort that San Shouwang whom you killed was a High-level Earth Ultimate God, Master,” said Cang Heng.

“No, you did the right thing. I’m indeed only a Peak Ultimate God and if the news that I’ve beheaded a High-level Earth Ultimate God spread, it’ll inevitably cause a commotion. I think it’s good for matters to develop as such since I still became the Territorial Lord.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Master. Although the Inspector approves of you as the Territorial Lord out of no choice today, I’m afraid he’ll find ways to make things difficult for you after he returns,” said Cang Heng.

“What more can he do after I’ve been instituted the Territorial Lord position?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Inspectors are a very special position in Crimson Stone Fort. This position has easy access to a lot of benefits with each inspection will usually bring him a great deal of wealth. It’s a position to get fast money.

“It’s hard to obtain such a position in Crimson Stone Fort without strong backers. The inspector had blatantly asked for two million Primordial Stones just now. He must have strong backers to do so.”

“Furthermore, he could easily use his backer to make things difficult for you after returning to Crimson Stone Fort. For instance, a slight increase of ten to twenty percent on levy every thousand years to Northern Darkstar Territory is enough to cause you a massive headache,” explained Cang Heng solemnly.

“Levy?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had heard about the levy.

Every sect, force, and clans within the many wildernesses of a Stellar Region—no matter large or small—would have to pay a certain amount of Primordial Stones to the Territorial Lord every thousand years.

Thereafter, the Stellar Region Territorial Lords would have to pay those he collected to the person in the power within the said domain.

Considering Northern Darkstar Territory as an example—various sects, forces, and clans would have to hand over money to the Territorial Lord every thousand years, but the Territorial Lord could only keep a small amount of the collection as most had to be given to Crimson Stone Fort.

“What percentage was the levy paid to Crimson Stone Fort in every one thousand years when San Shouwang was the Territorial Lord?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“According to Crimson Stone Fort’s rules, each Territorial Lord has to pay seventy percent of the levy collected every one thousand years. However, if the Inspector earlier deliberately wants to put you in trouble, he could always increase the levy to eighty or even ninety percent!” Cang Heng replied.

“Eighty or ninety percent?” Jian Wushuang’s face turned ashen and solemnly said, “If it’s a rule set by Crimson Stone Fort, even an inspector with strong backing can’t violate the rule as he wishes, right?”

“No, it’s not as simple as you think.” Cang Heng shook his head. “The rules were hard and fast when Crimson Stone Fort was at its peak. No one in Danyang Holy Domain will dare to violate any of their rules such that even Crimson Stone Fort higher-ups had to follow the rules. No one dares to violate it.

“But things are different now...”
