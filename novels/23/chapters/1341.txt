“The Ancient God clan…”

“I bear the Ancient God clan’s fellowship. Now that that young man has come to my mystery land, let me make good affinity with him.”

“Ah Qi.”

Swoosh!

A purple-haired lady appeared next to her.

“In the mystery land right now, there’s a Universe God in the First Heaven who is at the fourth level. When he’s preparing to leave, pass this to him,” the woman in the Taoist robe took an item out.

“Yes,” the purple-haired lady took over and vanished into thin air.

The woman in the Taoist robe closed her eyes and the cave became quiet again.

On the fourth level of Tian Yuan Mystery Land, Jian Wushuang had been cultivating. With the aid of the assault of consciousness, his Soul Power had improved tremendously.

The ten-year time limit was ending soon.

Jian Wushuang could feel the surrounding sky and land rejecting him faintly.

“Have to leave soon.”

Jian Wushuang said regrettably, feeling a little disappointed.

The assault of consciousness in Tian Yuan Mystery Land was extremely useful for his training. In ten years, his Soul Power improved tremendously. If he were to continue to stay, he would definitely improve even more greatly. It’s a pity that he could only stay in Tian Yuan Mystery Land for ten years. The moment time was up, he had to leave.

Just when Jian Wushuang had stood up and was preparing to leave…

Swoosh!

A green flowing light suddenly spurted before him.

Jian Wushuang was stunned and extended his hand instinctually. He grabbed the green, flowing light straightaway.

“This is…?” Jian Wushuang spread his hand and looked at the green crystal in his hand. A green crystal with a green tinge. It looked rather unusual.

“This is the Paradise Stone that the experts or ancestors of Eternal Chaotic World used for recording secret skills and important information,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard.

“Paradise Stone?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, use your Soul Power to examine the internals of this Paradise Stone,” King of Venomous Worms instructed.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded and covered the Paradise Stone with his Soul Power. Suddenly, there was a tremendous momentum of information that surged out.

“The Secret Skill of… Tian Yuan!”

“This is it?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“The secret skill of Soul Attack!” King of Venomous Worms let out an exclamation.

In the Paradise Stone there was a secret skill and it was the extremely rare secret skill of Soul Attack!

“Soul Power is extremely high-end on its own, while the secret skill of Soul Attack is – just like the Universal Dao Scripture that your master gave you – rare. You’re that lucky that you got the secret skill of Soul Attack?” King of Venomous Worms exclaimed.

“No, maybe it’s not luck,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said solemnly, “although I possess Soul Power, I could only integrate my Soul Power into Sword Principle for an attack. Although it would be considered as a Soul Attack too, it wouldn’t allow me to give full play to my Soul Power entirely!”

“I really am lacking of the real secret skill of Soul Attack!”

“I happen to be lacking it and I got it? And I got it when I am about to leave Tian Yuan Mystery Land? How could it be such a coincidence?”

“Jian Wushuang, you mean…” King of Venomous Worms lowered his voice as he thought of the possibility too.

Jian Wushuang didn’t speak but lifted his head. He looked afar at the vast expanse of whiteness before him, into the depth of Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and said, “Although I do not know your name, I, Jian Wushuang will owe you a debt of gratitude for your kindness. I’ll definitely repay you in the future.”

Then, Jian Wushuang stood there for a while before he left.

In the cave dwelling in the depths of Tian Yuan Mystery Land, the woman in the Taoist robe opened her eyes again.

“Definitely repay me in the future? This young man is quite interesting.”

The woman in Taoist robe shook her head and became turned quiet again.

Soon enough, the thirty geniuses in Tian Yuan Mystery Land were all sent out.

In the ten years duration, the geniuses were more or less rewarded.

While Jian Wushuang was obviously the one with the biggest reward.

No only did he increased his Soul Power tremendously with the aid of the assault of consciousness, he even obtained the secret skill of Soul Attack in the end.

The secret skill of Soul Attack in particular was extremely hard to come by.

“The secret skill of Tian Yuan.”

After getting out from Tian Yuan Mystery Land, Jian Wushuang couldn’t wait but started to study the secret skill.

“The method of using Soul Power is very unique. This is the secret skill of Soul Attack?” Jian Wushuang praised.

“Jian Wushuang, back when I was wandering around Eternal Chaotic World with King Luo Zhen, I’ve seen countless experts. I’ve also seen some people who pulled the secret skill of Soul Attack. But from what I see, this secret skill of Tian Yuan would be an extremely strong secret skill of Soul Attack,” King of Venomous Worms said, “Such an impressive secret skill of Soul Attack wouldn’t be easy to perform.”

“Mm, I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The secret skill of Tian Yuan had four levels of attack in total.

Even at the very first level, Inextinguishable Light required an enormous amount of Soul Power to be pulled off.

Jian Wushuang just ignited his Soul Power not long ago and it had yet to take shape as a real Soul Power. Hence, his Soul Power wasn’t as immense.

“According to the standard of my current Soul Power, I could barely pull off Inextinguishable Light. I reckon I would only be able to do it once and my Soul Power would be exhausted,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Of course, although it was difficult to perform, its power was definitely ferocious.

“Jian Wushuang, after ten years of training in Tian Yuan Mystery Land, the strength of your soul has improved tremendously. It could be compared favorably to a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Even if you do not perform the secret skill of Tian Yuan, I reckon there wouldn’t be many Universe Gods in the Second Heaven who could resist your Soul Attack performed via Sword Principle. With this point alone, you are already at the peak of Universe God in the Second Heaven!”

“If you could perform the first level of the secret skill of Tian Yuan, Inextinguishable Light… even if you could only do it once, the Soul Attack is enough to threaten a Universe God in the Third Heaven. If I’m not mistaken, with this technique alone, it’s even possible to kill a Universe God in the Third Heaven straightway!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“To kill a Universe God in the Third Heaven?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded, “Universe God in the Third Heaven is so easily killed!?”

Although Jian Wushuang replied so, he was extremely delighted.

He knew that he had himself another trump card, which was the secret skill of Tian Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, with your current power, although it is still risky to travel to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries alone, it is still equally possible for you to reach there alive. You can depart now,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“If so, let me bid farewell with Lord Wu Cang and I shall make a move!” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He immediately sent a message to inform Lord Wu Cang.

Wu Cang knew long ago that Jian Wushuang wanted to leave, so he wasn’t surprised.

Soon, Jian Wushuang left Snow Dojo, left Snow Kingdom and departed towards the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
