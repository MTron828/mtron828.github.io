Chapter 2353: One Close, One Far

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Secret Skill of Seven Star could increase one’s cultivation realm.

Although Jian Wushuang had only mastered the first scroll, it allowed anyone below the Undying Saint to raise their cultivation realm by half a level.

One shouldn’t underestimate this half a level as it was extremely important to a cultivator.

For example, Jian Wushuang was an Early Stage Chaotic Realm initially. After the increment, he would be at the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.

This advancement was a material improvement to Jian Wushuang’s strength.

At the very least, he was a lot stronger in the aspects of power and strength.

“Previously, even with the Immemorial Celestial Body, I was still far from an ordinary Third Grade Divine Demon in terms of power and strength. However, the current me won’t be any weaker than an ordinary Third Grade Divine Demon now that I’ve reached Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. In fact, I’ll be considered extremely strong among Third Grade Divine Demons.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Regardless of his understanding in Sword Principle, sword technique, or grasp over Rules of Order, he was way stronger than a Second Grade Divine Demon.

However, his only weakness was the stark difference in his power and strength.

Now, with the help of Secret Skill of Seven Star, his cultivation realm had been raised and his power and strength were extensively increased. Although he was still slightly inferior to a Second Grade Divine Demon, the difference was no longer that huge.

“Let me see how strong a Second Grade Divine Demon really is!”

Jian Wushuang laughed out loud and his body started flickering. He darted forward and charged towards Qian Yuan.

Qian Yuan had been locked onto Jian Wushuang all along.

When Jian Wushuang’s aura strengthened, he noticed it as well.

“His aura strengthened? And by a huge amount to the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm? This isn’t a breakthrough. It’s probably due to him casting some unique secret skills.” Qian Yuan furrowed his brows.

A secret skill that could temporarily increase his cultivation realm?

This was uncommon in the entire Wusha Barren Region, let alone Golden Cauldron Sect.

“This brat must be harboring some huge secrets.” Qian Yuan confirmed his thoughts.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang clashed with Qian Yuan.

Qian Yuan held his sabre with both hands and his sabre skills were scorching like fireballs.

Once he swung his sabre, the terrifying might was enough to plunge a Third Grade Divine Demon in despair.

However, Jian Wushuang was fearless. When Qian Yuan swung his sabre, he did the same with his Blood Mountain Sword.

The moment he did, a strong gust of wind swept across.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo – Blast Rainstorm!

“Die now!” Qian Yuan responded with a scoff.

He was a Second Grade Divine Demon and specialized in close combat fighting.

Although Jian Wushuang had an extremely high understanding of Spacetime Rules of Order and was oddly quick, he was completely inferior in terms of strength and power.

Now, Jian Wushuang chose not to dodge Qian Yuan’s domineering strike and relied on his superior speed to pester Qian Yun. Instead, he foolishly tried to clash directly with his sword technique. If this wasn’t courting his own death, what was it?

However, the moment both of them clashed...

“What?” Qian Yuan was shocked.

He could feel a power that was not inferior to his encompassed within Jian Wushuang’s sword.

Indeed, the power of the strike wasn’t any weaker than his.

Perhaps he was not a match in the aspect of basic strength. However, Jian Wushuang’s technique included his understanding of Rules of Order, which greatly enhanced the power of his sword techniques. Now, he could face Qian Yuan directly.

“There’s nothing impressive about the strength and power of a Second Grade Divine Demon after all!” Jian Wushuang grinned.

Tsk! Qian Yuan snorted and swung out his sabre three consecutive times.

Three scorching-hot sabre lights slashed out instantly.

“Ludicrous!” Jian Wushuang sneered and swung out three sword lights as well.

They were ordinary strikes. However, with his understanding of Sword Principle and application of Rules of Order, their might was enhanced exponentially.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

Three consecutive clashes pushed Jian Wushuang and Qian Yuan several steps back.

However, before Jian Wushuang could stabilize himself, a powerful soul attack swept through his mind.

This soul attack had probably been accumulated by Xiang Yi for some time before being released in one go. As a result, it had some effects on the Exquisite Pagoda within Jian Wushuang’s consciousness sea. The Exquisite Pagoda shook a little but quickly recovered.

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness wasn’t affected greatly.

Weng!

A giant dullish-gold rod descended from the sky with overwhelming momentum, seemingly aiming to decimate Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s figure flickered and the dullish-gold rod pierced through his body without even touching the edges of his clothes.

“He is much faster than before.” Xiang Yi frowned.

He didn’t realize that the increment in the cultivation realm wasn’t just limited to strength and power. Jian Wushuang’s speed had changed accordingly as well.

“Jian Wushuang, take this strike from me.”

A deafening scream erupted. Unknowingly, Qian Yuan had raised the sabre in his hand.

His sabre had turned entirely red and its surroundings seemed to be shrouded in a layer of scorching hot flames.

The aura around him bubbled and even his hair was blown up as the fire raged.

“Blood-Fire Style!”

Boom!

Terrifying sabre light descended all of a sudden.

That sabre light was blood red and opened up a giant river of blades instantly.

As the river of blades swept across in a frenzy, the area it crossed was set ablaze.

A giant sea of flames was formed instantly.

Within the sea of flames, a flaming sabre that spanned over a thousand feet slashed furiously towards Jian Wushuang.

“The power in this strike is pretty impressive!”

Staring at the approaching flaming sabre, Jian Wushuang became a little more serious.

Immediately after, he thrust his sword forward.

This strike looked ordinary and seemed devoid of all strength. However, when the edge of the sword pierced into the air, Reincarnation Power started spreading.

Samsara!

Weng!

When the edge of the sword clashed with the flaming sabre, none of the power spread to the surrounding area.

At the moment of contact, the flames on the flaming sabre began dissipating at an unbelievable speed.

In just moments, the flaming sabre was reduced to the most foundational divine power and Sabre Essence.

The strongest strike from Qian Yuan had been easily neutralized. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As for Jian Wushuang’s strike that carried the force of Samsara, it continued lunging forward.

Pfft!

The edge of the sword landed on Qian Yuan’s holy body. Qian Yuan’s self-defence mechanism was pretty impressive. Furthermore, the power behind the sword light had declined extensively after obliterating the flaming sabre.

This strike only just pierced Qian Yuan’s body and didn’t do much damage to Qian Yuan.

However, Qian Yuan was shocked.

“How can this be?”

“His strike...”

Qian Yuan couldn’t understand what had happened in the previous strike.

How had Jian Wushuang obliterated his flaming sabre with a single strike?
