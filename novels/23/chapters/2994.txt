Chapter 2995: Heaven Level Members

——

“Run!”

After the burly bald man regenerated his divine body, he chose to run without any hesitation.

He also saw that Jian Wushuang had the battle strength of a rank two True Saint, and he was probably not weak among them.

Such a powerful existence was not something he could fight against.

Even if the four peak rank one True Saints joined hands, they would not be able to fight against him.

The difference between a True Saint and a rank one True Saint was ridiculous.

Although it was difficult for Jian Wushuang to kill him because of his immortal body, there was still a high chance that the burly bald man did not want to take the risk.

He was not the only one. After seeing Jian Wushuang’s battle strength, the Blood Blade Island Master, the red-clothed girl, and the cold-looking black-robed young man also made a decision at once.

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s go!”

The experts who were about to attack turned around and fled.

Jian Wushuang was too lazy to chase after them.

Even if he chased after them, he could only kill a few False Saints. It was too difficult to kill a True Saint. After all, the immortal body of a True Saint was there. It was not easy to kill him.

Soon, all the experts of the four overlords had fled.

Jian Wushuang put away his longsword and looked at Qin Dong and the others behind him. “It’s okay, let’s go.”

The group continued to set off. On the way, Qin Dong and the others were even more respectful of Jian Wushuang.

A rank two True Saint was definitely a top expert in the endless territories. Qin Dong’s Qin clan had many experts, but the strongest one was also a peak rank two True Saint.

Even the Qin family had to treat a rank two True Saint with respect. With such an expert escorting them, they were completely at ease.

The journey was silent.

The four overlords were completely intimidated by Jian Wushuang’s strength and did not have the courage to come over again.

Jian Wushuang and the others flew along. After a period of time, they finally successfully walked out of the Godless Sea area. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“My mission is to send you through the Godless Sea area. Now that we are out of the Godless Sea area, my mission is over. Goodbye,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Thank you for the journey, sir,” Uncle Lei said.

“Thank you, sir,” Qin Dong and the surrounding guards said humbly.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and then left.

…

In one of the secret nests of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“Hand over the task.”

Jian Wushuang handed over a mirror token. The mirror token recorded the journey and used it to identify whether he had really completed the task alone. It only took some time.

Soon, someone handed him an interspatial ring and a new identity token.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you have completed three earth-level three-star tasks alone. Congratulations. From today on, you are a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and can enjoy many privileges as a heaven-grade member.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang took the interspatial ring and token with a smile on his face.

After becoming a heaven-level member, he immediately went to the Treasure Pavilion.

“Sir Tianshuo, I want to exchange this Destruction Beast God statue for sacred elixirs. According to what I said before, this Destruction Beast God statue is worth 500 million sacred elixirs, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Sir Tianshuo nodded.

“Well, this Destruction Beast God statue has 500 million sacred elixirs, and I have 280 million ready-made sacred elixirs in my interspatial ring, as well as many cultivation resources and treasures. It should be worth about 20 to 30 million sacred elixirs. I’ll take 20 million sacred elixirs and add them all together. That’s 800 million sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang took out an interspatial ring and said.

Lord Tianshuo glanced at the interspatial ring and nodded slightly. “I’ll give you 800 million sacred elixirs. What do you want to exchange for? The gold-cracking secret manual?”

“Yes, I want to exchange for the first volume of the gold-cracking secret manual,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Sure.” Lord Tianshuo waved his hand and took away the Destruction Beast God statue and the interspatial ring, then he said, “Wait here for a while. Soon someone will send you the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual,” Lord Tianshuo said.

“Thank you, sir.” Jian Wushuang was delighted.

After leaving the Treasure Pavilion, he waited in the secret nest with great expectations.

A few days later, someone handed the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual to him.

…

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in a dark secret room, with a scroll made of jade slips floating in front of him.

The scroll was not very long, but it contained a vast amount of information.

The Gold-Splitting Secret Manual was left behind by an extremely powerful Rule Master in the Divine Beginning World, the Gold-Splitting Master.

This manual not only left behind the Gold-Splitting Master’s many insights into the space-time rule and sword principle, but also the void swordsmanship he created.

Of course, most importantly, the Gold-Splitting Master also carried out an extremely detailed dissection of the space-time rule and sword principle.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang began to examine them carefully.

The first thing he saw was the dissection of the space-time rule.

The space-time rule was profound and unfathomable. From the first stage of the space-time illusion body to the second stage of the space-time blade…

“It’s too detailed. The dissection is too detailed.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

He had only seen the bottom part, which was the dissection of the first stage of the space-time rule, which was the space-time illusion body. He was completely shocked.

The spacetime illusion body, when it reached its limit at this stage, could burst out 1,000 spacetime illusions at the same time.

1,000 was already the limit.

And in this Gold-Splitting Secret Manual, the Gold-Splitting Master had perfectly dissected each of the 1,000 illusions, dissecting each of them into dozens or even hundreds of portions.

It was just like how ordinary people ate.

For example, it was impossible to eat a large pancake in one bite. However, if the pancake was split into several portions, it would be much easier. If the pancake was split into hundreds or even thousands of portions, it would become very, very small, then, even those toothless old ladies would be able to eat it easily.

It was the same for law comprehension.

Take the illusory body of spacetime for example. It was not easy for a cultivator to condense a second illusory body under the premise of condensing one illusory body. However, if the illusory body was dissected into dozens of parts, dozens of steps, and then completed one step at a time…each step was very easy…from difficult to easy, condensing the second illusory body would naturally become much easier.
