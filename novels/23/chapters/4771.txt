4772 Sand Demon Cave

As the entire Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture was completely crushed into dust, trillions of living beings were buried with it.

Then, Uncle Yu returned to the Heavenly Court with the group of Elders.

He came in a hurry and left in a hurry.

Everything seemed to have been erased, as if it had never existed.

The thick and heavy dust was devoured and absorbed by the astral winds in the universe.

The Heavenly Region that originally belonged to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture had been wiped out and replaced by nothingness.

It might have to go through millions of reincarnations in the galaxy before a new Heavenly Region could be born.

In the starry sky, as the dust fell, there were a few faint auras.

…

“Brothers, we’re going to be rich this time! Who has ever seen a crystal with such dense and pure Yan power?”

“Oh my God, this is dozens, no, hundreds of times denser in Yan power!”

“I didn’t expect that we could find such a treasure in such a remote desert. We should be rich!”

“No, here, why is there a pair of legs?”

In the yellow sand that covered the sky, there were nearly 50 men in thick and long clothes. They were swallowing their saliva as they looked at the black crystal that was as tall as a small mountain.

Furthermore, the cultivation of these men was not weak. They were all Ancestor realm cultivators.

At this time, the two men closest to the black crystal saw a leg under the crystal and directly pulled it out.

Whoosh…

As the black crystal collapsed and flowed, the owner of the legs finally appeared.

“B-boss, it’s a man!” the man with the full beard could not help but shout after seeing the figure clearly.

“What’s all the noise? Haven’t you seen a man before?” One of the pale-faced men glared at him, then looked at the unconscious man and gasped.

At this moment, the clothes on the upper body of the man who was unconscious in the black mountain crystal had been torn apart, revealing his well-proportioned body.

At the same time, his exposed skin was extremely red, as if it had been soaked in blood. On his chest, there was a Fire Phoenix spreading its wings and chirping, as if it could break free at any time and rush into the clouds.

When he first saw the unconscious man, the pale-faced man felt a great sense of danger.

His intuition, which had been used to escaping death several times, told him that this man was definitely a terrifying existence.

“Boss, there are people here too!”

The full-bearded man shouted again while pointing at the other leg buried in the black crystal.

“Boss, what should we do?” the subordinate who had also noticed something was amiss asked in a deep voice, a hint of ruthlessness in his eyes.

The pale-faced man did not hesitate. He immediately narrowed his eyes and said, “Kill them all while they are unconscious. Don’t leave a single one alive!”

All the top cultivators received the order and rushed forward. They controlled their respective Yan power and prepared to kill.

However, at this moment, an earth-shattering sound suddenly rang out. Then, countless powerful forces turned into a dense net and descended.

Before the pale-faced man’s subordinates could react, more than ten top cultivators were killed by Yan power who descended from the sky.

“Not good, Boss! Those guys from the Sand Demon Cave are here!” the full-bearded man cried out in shock. However, before he could reach the pale-faced man, Yan power, who had descended from the sky, pierced through his Life Source.

Blood splattered on his face.

A violent sandstorm swept up from the ground, accompanied by a terrifying strong wind. Hundreds of lazy figures approached from afar.

“Boss, let’s retreat. We’re far from being their match.”

The corners of the white-faced man’s eyes twitched. He was clearly unwilling to accept this.

This black crystal, which was hundreds or even thousands of times more precious than sky crystals, was already in his bag, but now he was giving it away. How could he do it?

However, it was only when the figures riding on the yellow sand got closer and closer that the pale-faced man finally waved his hand unwillingly. “Retreat!”

Before he retreated, he stretched out his hand again and grabbed nearly 1,000 black mountain crystals before he quickly escaped.

“What bad luck. This group of bastards actually dared to find food in our territory. They’re simply tired of living!”

The yellow sand dissipated, and the hundreds of figures gradually emerged.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the very front of these figures was a young man in casual clothes. He looked at the figures that were flying away and spat on the ground in disdain.

“Brothers, hurry up and move it. Whoever leaves a piece behind will be hung on the city gate for ten days!” The unrestrained young man’s face was full of dissatisfaction. As he waved his hand, the hundred men behind him all flew to the small mountain of crystals and began to move them.

Waving his hand to take a black crystal, the unrestrained young man raised his eyebrows and smiled. “That’s really not bad. This time, I’ll give all of them to Big Sister. Another great merit!”

“Commander Cui, there are a few people under these crystals,” a man responded. At the same time, he dragged out the bodies that were either buried under the crystals or in the yellow sand.

There were a total of six figures, five men and one woman.

When the unrestrained young man, who was called Commander Cui, saw the unconscious woman, his eyes could not help but brighten.

Even though her figure was in a sorry state, the yellow sand could not hide her gentle and beautiful figure.

“Commander Cui, their identities are unknown. It’s best to avoid contact with them,” the middle-aged man beside the unrestrained young man pulled him back in time and reminded him in a calm voice.

“I don’t need you to remind me. I just want to check if they’re pretending to be unconscious to prevent any unnecessary situations from happening.” The unrestrained young man shook off the middle-aged man’s hand and took a step forward, pretending to investigate.

With one look, he also saw some clues.

The five men and one woman, the six figures, had all suffered extremely heavy injuries. It could be said that they were on the verge of death.

There was a tall middle-aged man in tattered black and gold clothes. His entire chest had been torn apart by some terrifying force.

Moreover, from the clothing of these people, they all had a faint sense of authority.

The most important thing was that he could not see through the strength and realm of these people.

“Where did these suspicious guys come from? Why do they give me such a strong sense of deterrence?” the young man rubbed his chin and muttered.

“Commander Cui, what should we do with these unconscious people?” the middle-aged man reminded.

Hearing this, the young man stopped thinking and waved his hand. “Who cares? As long as we find it, it’s ours. Carry it all into the city. Don’t leave a single strand of hair behind!”

…

Between heaven and earth, the vast yellow sand became the only main color.

Due to the shaking and jolting, he was forced to slowly open his eyes from the pain.

A wisp of pure red light flickered in the depths of his eyes, and the star between his brows also began to slowly rotate.
