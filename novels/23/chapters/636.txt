Chapter 637: Ouyang Xuan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At first, those Sects experts thought that Jian Wushuang might have hidden his strength, but they quickly denied it.

They had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s performance in Round One and Round Two, so they were quite sure that Jian Wushuang had not hidden his strength.?At least, not in his comprehension of the Slaughter Dao. After all, his understanding of the Slaughter Dao had been normal.

The reason he made such incredible progress on the Slaughter Dao was completely due to the month he spent in cultivation at Enlightenment Mountain.

“He improved so quickly in only a month?”

Even those Sects experts, who had experienced many ups and downs over the years, were shocked.

On the battleground, Chu Yang was completely dazed because of the confrontation.

“Impossible!”

“This is impossible.”

“How could he make so much progress in only a month?”

Chu Yang kept roaring.

Jian Wushuang was standing in front of him with the Heart-killing Sword in his hand and a cold look in his eyes as he said, “You just said that I won’t even have a chance to surrender?”

Chu Yang was stunned.

“Let’s see who won’t get the chance to surrender!” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

In an instant, a continuous flash of sword shadows flew towards Chu Yang.

The progress made by these geniuses was not comparable to the progress that Jian Wushuang made in the month he spent meditating at Enlightenment Mountain.

He became much stronger in just the Slaughter Dao. He had finished comprehending the first occult even started meditating on the second occult.

However, these improvements by Jian Wushuang also greatly affected different aspects of his swordsmanship.

Because of his progress in the Slaughter Dao, Jian Wushuang was much stronger than a month ago. Chu Yang had no chance to win, so his only choice was to resign and accept his defeat at the hands of Jian Wushuang.

This fight ended in Jian Wushuang’s victory!

Jian Wushuang noticed that everyone was looking at him differently when he exited the battleground.

Those geniuses from the Eternal World had looked down upon Jian Wushuang. After this fight, however, they would not underestimate him anymore.

Jian Wushuang displayed an incredible strength that exceeded that of ordinary geniuses. What struck them the most though, was the amazing speed at which he improved.

He made such rapid progress in only a month, which was impossible for these geniuses to catch up to.

As soon as Jian Wushuang returned to the crowd he was surrounded by the geniuses from the Ancient World.

“Jian Wushuang, congratulations!” Feng looked over at Jian Wushuang and spoke in an icy voice.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re amazing!”

Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang all sighed with emotion. Before that, they had thought that Jian Wushuang would be unable to win since his strength wasn’t as good as theirs, but the result was far different from what they had imagined.

“Not bad.” Huo Ying looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Huo Ying, this is just the first battle. It should be an easy win for you,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I hope so.” Huo Ying smiled slightly.

Among the six geniuses from the Ancient World who made it to Round Three, Feng was considered to be the strongest, with Huo Ying, who had comprehended the first occult, trailing right behind him. Huo Ying’s first opponent was not any stronger than Chu Yang, so he should be easy to defeat if everything went well.

As expected, Huo Ying easily defeated his opponent.

Feng also defeated his opponent, who was a little stronger than Chu Yang but wasn’t able to hold one any longer than him.

The first round of the Arena Battle quickly ended.

Among the 124 geniuses, 62 winners continued on, drawing lots once again to decide their next opponent.

“Hum?” Jian Wushuang checked his token and saw that it had the number 1 on it.

That meant Jian Wushuang would be the first one to fight.

“My opponent... is him!” Jian Wushuang instantly locked onto his target.

It was a young well-groomed man with a folding fan in his hand.

Jian Wushuang knew this guy.

He was Ouyang Xuan.

Before the Firmament Territory Feast had started, someone had attempted to kill Ouyang Xuan in spite of the rules of the Feast. However, that person had been easily defeated because his strength was not good enough. Everyone had witnessed how powerful Ouyang Xuan was during that fight.

Afterwards, Ouyang Xuan easily passed Round One and Round Two, the easily beat his opponent in the first round of the Arena Battle. In this Firmament Territory Feast, his overall strength was good enough for him to rank within the top 20.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Ouyang Xuan!”

The middle-aged shouted loudly, then Jian Wushuang and Ouyang Xuan instantly appeared on the battleground.

Everyone looked at them as soon as they appeared.

Even the Sects experts in the Skyward Pavilion watched this with interest.

“Jian Wushuang made such great progress in only a month, even though he’s from the Ancient World, so he must be very talented. As for Ouyang Xuan, he is a top genius with a strong spirit. Very few people noticed him even though he showed tremendous strength from the beginning. He is quite promising.”

“Since Xuan Yi has already claimed Jian Wushuang, we can try to rope in Ouyang Xuan.”

“Jian Wushuang is supposed to be as powerful as Ouyang Xuan, but I wonder which one will triumph.”

“Just wait! It’s hard to tell who is stronger without a fierce fight.”

Until they saw Jian Wushuang and Chu Yang fight each other, those experts would not compare Jian Wushuang with Ouyang Xuan. At this moment, they were not sure who would win in this fight since Jian Wushuang’s strength seemed to be as powerful as Ouyang Xuan’s.

In the Ancient Sect’s room, Xuan Yi was staring at Jian Wushuang. He suddenly sighed and thought,?“What a pity! I thought Chu Yang would be able to force this little boy to show some of his trump cards. But, who would have thought that he could make so much progress in one month and beat Chu Yang with only the Slaughter Dao.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As of now, Xuan Yi was once again filled with hope when he saw that Jian Wushuang would be battling Ouyang Xuan.

“Chu Yang was not strong enough, but I believe that Ouyang Xuan can force him to reveal some of his trump cards.”
