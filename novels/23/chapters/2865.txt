Chapter 2866: Black Blood Emperor

——

“Master Qu, didn’t you want to kill me? It seems that these four people are not enough.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice slowly echoed between Heaven and Earth. Hearing it, Master Qu’s face immediately turned cold.

“Boy, don’t be too proud. It’s just killing four Great Divine Masters at the peak. So what’s the big deal?” Master Qu’s voice was shallow, but he looked at the Black Blood Emperor. “I’ll leave it to you. With your strength, it shouldn’t be a problem to take him down, right?”

“Yes.” The Black Blood Emperor nodded slightly, but his eyes gradually turned cold.

“Black Blood Emperor?” Jian Wushuang also glanced at the Black Blood Emperor.

When he left the Pill Sun Sacred World, he also got some special information from Yin Su’er.

Among them was the Black Blood Emperor.

The Black Blood Emperor had been an Invincible Divine Master for a long time.

There were different levels of Invincible Divine Masters, and the Black Blood Emperor was one of the most powerful among them.

Marquis of Three Yin, who had fought with Jian Wushuang, was also an Invincible Divine Master, but he was not as famous or powerful as the Black Blood Emperor. It was said that the Black Blood Emperor’s comprehension of the rules… in fact, he was even comparable to an ordinary Immortal Saint.

Under normal circumstances, as long as one had accumulated divine power to the limit of a divine master and knew some secret skills to increase the power of his power, in addition to his comprehension of the rules and Dao, he would be an Invincible Divine Master, to be able to create an ultimate skill, one could be considered an Invincible Divine Master.

When one’s comprehension of the rules exceeded that of a Divine Master and reached the level of an Immortal Saint, one could be considered an Invincible Divine Master in the second stage.

The Black Blood Emperor was an Invincible Divine Master who had entered the second stage.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang did not underestimate the Black Blood Emperor.

“After my realm broke through and my strength soared, I was worried that I would not have a suitable opponent to fight with. However, although the Black Blood Emperor is not a true Immortal Saint, he is not weak either. So it’s a good test of my current strength.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Come on, let me see what level you can force me to.”

Jian Wushuang was full of expectation.

The Black Blood Emperor’s face was cold, and his eyes were icy.

He stared at Jian Wushuang, but there was already vast darkness spreading out from his body. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This darkness was boundless and covered the vast world. An extremely oppressive aura instantly swept out, suffocating people.

The Black Blood Emperor slowly raised his right hand and pointed in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

“Go!”

He spat out a word.

The boundless darkness directly covered Jian Wushuang.

The boundless dark airflow surged wildly in the void and condensed into a huge dark vortex instantly.

The dark vortex was at least 300 meters wide. As soon as it appeared, it began to spin crazily. As it spun, a world-shaking devouring power suddenly erupted.

Heaven-devouring Earth!

The huge dark vortex mercilessly devoured everything in the void.

The dark vortex continued to expand and slowly approached Jian Wushuang.

“As expected!”

Looking at the huge dark vortex in front of him, Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised.

“To be able to form such a huge dark vortex with just a raise of his hand, his comprehension of the dark rules must have reached an incredible level. At the very least, it’s not something that a Divine Master can achieve.” Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised. However, he was not afraid at all.

When the huge dark vortex engulfed him, a shocking sword essence rose from Jian Wushuang’s body.

This sword essence wanted to tear the world apart.

A thick divine power slowly surged out of Jian Wushuang’s divine body. Then, Jian Wushuang struck out.

He just struck out casually, looking like an ordinary person wielding a wooden sword.

However, when he swung his long sword, a sword light immediately lit up.

This sword light was feeble, dim, and incomplete.

It was a broken light, a remnant light!

However, when this remnant light appeared, at least a hundred and thousands of remnant lights were everywhere in the blink of an eye.

Even Jian Wushuang’s body turned into hundreds and thousands of people at this moment.

Thousand-sided remnant light!

The ultimate skill created by Jian Wushuang was also his most powerful sword move.

Buzz!

The seemingly dim remnant light actually contained a terrifying power.

The remnant light charged into the majestic dark vortex as if the dark vortex had mercilessly devoured it. However, in just a moment, the dazzling light in the majestic dark vortex became brighter and brighter.

Finally, the endless sword light completely exploded, along with hundreds of space-time blades hidden under the sword light.

These sword lights and space-time blades frantically swept out in all directions.

The vast and majestic dark vortex was torn into pieces by these sword lights and space-time blades.

The entire dark vortex completely collapsed, and the dark airflow that filled the sky also scattered wildly in all directions.

However, the dark vortex had just been defeated. Whoosh!

A figure silently appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly constricted, and he had already sensed the figure’s arrival from the corner of his eye.

Whoosh!

The dark saber light did not stir up any momentum at all. Instead, it also silently slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

Although the saber light did not carry much power, Jian Wushuang had already sensed the terrifying power contained in the dark saber light the moment it was swung.

Jian Wushuang immediately raised his hand and waved his sword to block it.

Clang!

A low collision sound was heard. Jian Wushuang’s body slightly sank. Before he could fight back, the owner of the dark saber light, the Black Blood Emperor, once again released his saber.

This saber move was completely different from the first one.

This saber move brought about the entire world and the endless darkness in the surroundings. The power it carried was shocking, and the saber light was extremely domineering.

Rumble! The saber light descended. Jian Wushuang could even sense that the surrounding void was trembling crazily as if it could not withstand the power of the saber light.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly. Then, under the surge of divine power, he swung the blood mountain sword directly.

Clang!

The two collided, and the power completely exploded. However, it was obvious that Jian Wushuang was at an absolute disadvantage.

“What a strong power.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused. He had already felt a strong power coming from the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand. His body slightly trembled, and he could not help but retreat.

But at this time, the Black Blood Emperor raised his hand and swung it down.

In a flash, the third slash came.

And the power of the third slash was obviously more powerful and terrifying than the previous two!
