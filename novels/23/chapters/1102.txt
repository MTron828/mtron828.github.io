Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang?”

“Not only is the kid not running away after seeing that we’re being chased, instead, he’s stupidly charging toward us. Is he looking to die?”

The Celestial Masters got even more angry after seeing Jian Wushuang dashing toward them.

“Kid, run quickly!” Celestial Master Yi even shouted sternly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not heed his warning. He fixed his cold stare on the Exotic Beast.

“Swoosh!”

Jian Wushuang passed them by, appearing before the purple Exotic Beast.

“What’s the kid doing? Does he really want to die?”

“He’s insane!”

The scene unfolding behind them shocked both Celestial Masters.

Very quickly, they understood what Jian Wushuang was up to.

His look grew more murderous as the power emanating from the Blood Mountain Sword increased as well. He then slashed at the Exotic Beast with it.

“Heaven’s Bane!” Jian Wushuang cried in a chilling tone.

In an instant, he unleashed the full might of his power.

The purple beast growled and swung a palm at Jian Wushuang casually; it wanted to smash the ‘ant’ in front of it into pieces.

“Crash!”

A low crashing noise rang out and many sparks flew. A large amount of power began to disperse into the surroundings.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grim, and all of a sudden, his figure was swatted away and it crashed into a barren mountain at his side. The mountain split into two from the impact and huge amounts of loose rocks began raining down. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Exotic Beast, however, had stopped charging forward;?many scales had fallen off its palm that clashed with the Blood Mountain Sword.

Just like this, Jian Wushuang managed to stop the Beast Puppet’s figure from moving forward.

“Boom!”

There was a loud booming sound as large amounts of loose rocks began flying out. Jian Wushuang re-emerged from the remains of the mountain. Unexpectedly, his aura was still strong and his complexion healthy. Evidently, the blow from the beast had not harmed him much.

“Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long, you two should leave first. Leave this fellow to me,” Jian Wushuang said with a slight smile.

The two Celestial Masters were a little dumbstruck now.

They had personally experienced the terror of the purple beast, and Celestial Master Yi was seriously wounded by a blow from its palm; he had managed to survive because he used a protective treasure to absorb part of the impact from the blow.

All in all, even if the Exotic Beast was not as strong as a real Celestial Master who had reached the Exceptional Realm, it was not too much weaker.

“How could Jian Wushuang had survived that blow and remained unscathed?”?they thought.

They were shocked!

Extremely shocked, to be exact.

After recovering, they immediately reacted to his suggestion; neither of them hesitated to accept his offer.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful yourself,” said Celestial Master Yi.

He then hurriedly left with Celestial Master Meng Long.

“Roar!”

The purple beast growled as it saw the two Celestial Masters leaving. The purple lightning surrounding its body began flowing, and its figure immediately gave chase.

Jian Wushuang, however, had also begun to move.

“Stop, I say.”

He appeared phantom-like at its side, brandishing the Blood Mountain Sword at the same time. In a flash, he had struck four times, all of them with amazing speed. They were directed straight at the beast’s eyes.

The beast had no choice but to shift its figure away from the attacks. At the same time, it struck at Jian Wushuang with the same palm, and this time, it was imbued with Purple Thunderbolts. As such, it was more powerful than the last attack.

Jian Wushuang shifted his figure and dodged the attack easily. The palm of the beast struck the Void where Jian Wushuang used to stand, smashing it into dust. The world-shattering power of the blow caused Jian Wushuang’s pupils to contract involuntarily.

“What power! This Beast Puppet’s battle strength is borderline Celestial Master’s Exceptional Realm,”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

He could not withstand the repeated attacks from a Celestial Master at the Exceptional Realm, but he possessed exceptional defensive capabilities and could still hold the beast up for a while more.

“Buzz…”

The Void around them shook. The purple scales of the Exotic Beast had stood up after it missed its target, and huge amounts of Purple Thunderbolts rose from its body, shattering the Void around it. This power then formed into a giant electric net dropping down upon Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang struck with his sword. As the powerful sword light hit the electrical net, however, it quickly dissipated.

“My attack couldn’t slash the net open?”?Jian Wushuang thought. He was shocked, and to make matters worse, the net was still descending upon him, its momentum unchecked.

“Whoosh!” An awe-inspiring amount of power burst forth from Jian Wushuang’s body, but it quickly dissipated after a while.

Jian Wushuang was still standing perfectly well at his original spot. He raised a hand to pat the corner of his robe, but he began to smile faintly.

“The Beast Puppet’s strength is close to Celestial Master’s Exceptional Realm and much higher than mine. That said, it still will be unable to hit me,”?thought Jian Wushuang, secretly pleased.

“Roar!” the beast growled as it fixed its murderous gaze on Jian Wushuang.

Because of him, the Celestial Masters had long escaped.

“It’s extremely strong in terms of attack, speed, and defense. I’m not its match, and I’d better leave while I can,”?Jian Wushuang thought, smiling slightly. He then immediately put his Dragon Blood Secret Skill to use.

The first level of the Secret Skill increased Jian Wushuang’s speed by tenfold immediately. He fled with amazing speed, and the purple beast was hell-bent on giving chase, but the distance between them kept increasing. Soon, its target was completely gone from its line of sight.

The Celestial Masters were quietly waiting for Jian Wushuang amongst ruins. Both of them had mixed emotions.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared, traversing toward them from the Void at a considerable distance away.

“Are you two alright?” Jian Wushaung asked, laughing heartily as he saw the two Celestial Masters, especially the elderly hunchback.

“I was only slightly wounded, and will recover after doing the closed-door training for a while,” replied Celestial Master Yi. He then lifted his head to look at Jian Wushuang before continuing in a tone that made him sound guilty. “Jian Wushuang, before…” he said.

“What happened earlier was a trivial matter. Please don’t take it to heart,” Jian Wushuang laughed. It was the truth; he had not taken it seriously.

“I’m ashamed, I really am,” sighed Celestial Master Yi as he shook his head.

“Jian Wushuang, we were too conceited. We would like to apologize and thank you for your help earlier on,” Celestial Master Meng Long chipped in.

They felt ashamed of their actions from the bottom of their heart.

Previously, they had not welcomed Jian Wushuang when he came over to exchange greetings. Celestial Master Yi was especially hostile to him, and even reprimanded him for a bit; he had described Jian Wushuang’s action of venturing alone into the uncharted territory as akin to courting his own death.

But, what happened after that?

If it were not for Jian Wushuang’s intervention, both of them would have died there and then in the hands of the Beast Puppet.
