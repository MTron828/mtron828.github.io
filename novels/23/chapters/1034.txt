The battle was raging on. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The figure of one of Dao Master Nine Sword’s guards had risen to three meters tall, and he gave off a vague bronze glow. He wielded a large axe and brought forth an immense amount of power; he managed to completely suppress six Dao Masters of the Bone Clan just by himself.

Furthermore, two Dao Masters had already fallen to his large axe.

“Haha, die, all you bastards of the Bone Clan,” he exclaimed.

He bellowed like a barbarian and swung his large axe wildly.

Whoosh!

All of a sudden, a scarlet ray of blade light swooped down upon him.

It was extremely fast and powerful. Most crucially, it happened very suddenly and nearly without warning.

“What?”

It happened so quickly that even the barbarian scrambled to react. Even so, as a Peak Rank Three Dao Master, he was not flustered. With a low growl, he cast the six Dao Masters of the Bone Clan aside and struck back with his large axe. It left a bewildering trace as it slashed through the Void, directly toward the blade light.

“Bang!”

A loud sound rang out as the two weapons clashed. The barbarian was knocked back by the impact of the clash and stumbled a few steps backward.

After steadying himself, he looked cautiously at the Void in front of him.

A cold-looking man with a hideous sword scar on his face appeared there, a blood-red saber in his hand.

“That look, and the move just now… are you Bloody Army Saber?” growled the barbarian in a low voice.

On the other side of the battlefield, the other Peak Rank Three Dao Master was also held up by Rakshasa. He had also recognized her very quickly.

“Army Saber and Rakshasa?” commented Dao Master Nine Sword. He was standing in the Void beside the combatants, his gaze gradually turning cold. “It turns out that the intruders are the two famous blood moon level killers from the Blood Saber Organization. It seems that you guys from the Bone Clan were well prepared and hired these two top-notch killers in one go. I guess you paid a hefty price, right?”

Dao Master Nine Sword had not noticed that the remaining experts of the Bone Clan were also wearing a bewildered look on their faces.

They were not sure as to how the two blood moon level killers had appeared suddenly.

“We did not hire them, didn’t we??” they thought.

After all, they did not expect Dao Master Nine Sword to appear today, and that he would have wanted to exterminate their clan. Furthermore, no one could hire the killers of this level as they wished. It would require a hefty payment, and based on the fortune of their clan, it would be hard for them to engage their services.

“So, who hired Army Saber and Rakshasa?”?they wondered.

“No matter who hired them, he or she wants to help us. With their aid, there’s still a good chance our clan could survive,” said the burly Clan Leader with a low growl, before striking again at his opponents.

The experts of the Bone Clan were also overjoyed and immediately worked in tandem with the two killers.

“You guys from the Blood Saber Organization are indeed very bold to interfere in the matters of the Ancient Monster Clan,” said Dao Master Nine Sword with an icy coldness that soon pervaded the air.

“Don’t try to scare me, Dao Master Nine Sword. Our organization has been accepting payment to help our clients ease their suffering all this while. As long as the client can afford to pay us, there’s nothing that our organization dares not to do,” taunted Army Saber.

Jian Wushuang was standing in the Void not far away from the battle and took the entire scene in. The corners of his lips curled up and unexpectedly, he removed his wicked-looking blood-red mask.

Even though the mask helped to disguise his true identity to a certain extent, it was also too conspicuous.

“The two Peak Rank Three Dao Masters are already kept busy. Now, it’s his turn,” said Jian Wushuang as he fixed his gaze on Dao Master Nine Sword.

“Jian Wushuang, the person you’re about to deal with must have some special item used for defense on him, since he managed to occupy such an important position in the Ancient Monster Clan. Be careful not to let him slip when you strike,” reminded Gu King.

“Don’t worry, I have my own plans,” said Jian Wushuang with a slight smile, before dashing into the battlefield.

Dao Master Nine Sword was observing the battle from the side, but his expression was gradually turning gloomy.

Both Army Saber and Rakshasa possessed Peak Rank Three Dao Master’s battle strength, and they were on par with their opponents. Combined with the strength of the Bone Clan experts, the tables had now turned on his subordinates, and they were now completely suppressed.

“I didn’t expect killers from the Blood Saber Organization to show up. Things are turning tricky now.”

“As the number one organization of killers in the entire Samsara Continent, its strength is extraordinarily great. Even our Ancient Monster Clan is extremely wary of it, and now that their killers are present, I think it’ll be impossible to wipe out the Bone Clan today.”

Dao Master Nine Sword was still wondering to himself when all of a sudden, a figure suddenly appeared in the Void beside him and rushed toward him.

The aura of an Eternal Realm expert burst forth; it even contained an unparalleled rage.

“Damned Ancient Monster Clan, I’ll fight to the death with you people!!!”

A loud roar abruptly reverberated throughout the surrounding space.

The attacker seemed to be someone from the Bone Clan who had gone berserk and wanted to fight Dao Master Nine Sword to the death.

Dao Master Nine Sword still stood at his original spot, and a look of disdain flashed across his face when he heard the roar coming from his side.

He could not even bother to turn to look at his opponent and absent-mindedly struck a finger toward the Void where his opponent was coming from.

A ray of Sword Essence burst forth with amazing speed.

Even though it was a move made casually by Dao Master Nine Sword, its power was extremely great. Even a Rank One Dao Master could very possibly not survive the attack, much less an Eternal Realm expert.

The Sword Essence leapt forward and at first, everything happened according to Dao Master Nine Sword’s expectations. It appeared directly in front of his opponent, and there was no way the Eternal Realm expert could escape as it struck him square on the body.

The Eternal Realm expert still continued advancing, but at a much-reduced speed. The aura from him was also rapidly diminishing.

“You’re nothing but an ant, yet you wish to fight me to the death?” asked Dao Master Nine Sword with a contemptuous laugh.

But suddenly…

The Eternal Realm expert, whose speed had been greatly reduced, suddenly lifted his head and burst forth with a boom.

The space behind him burst open, and his figure pierced through the Void in an instant. He appeared in front of Dao Master Nine Sword simultaneously.

Such speed was many times faster than those ordinary Dao Masters.

“What?” exclaimed Dao Master Nine Sword who could not help but feel extremely alarmed now.

He turned his head immediately to look at his opponent. It was only at this very moment that he finally saw his enemy’s face.

His pupils shrank abruptly upon seeing it.

“You, you’re…” he opened his mouth, trying to say something.

Jian Wushuang laughed coldly; it sounded as chilly as the coldest winter. “Jiu Xiu, it’s been a while since we last met each other,” he said, every one of his words traveling deep into Dao Master Nine Sword’s ears, causing all of the hairs on his body to stand up.
