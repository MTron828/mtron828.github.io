Chapter 1563: A Celestial Being Descends

A dazzling light appeared from a tree abruptly. The light was too dazzling and it was definitely the brightest light that the young man had ever seen.

When the light glowed, a white-haired old man appeared in the young man’s line of vision.

“Could this be the celestial being that mother mentioned?” the young man stared.

At the next moment, the young man ran in front of the white-haired old man.

“Old mister, are you a celestial being?” the young man raised his head and looked at the white-haired old man. His face was filled with excitement.

“A celestial being?” Jian Wushuang looked at the little kid in front of him with interest. After seeing his bright, big eyes, he was delighted.

If he were at his peak, with his abilities, one could say that he was a god in the Qing Tian Mystery Land.

However, at the very moment, he was only a normal person.

“I am not a celestial being. I am just a person passing by this area,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“You’re lying. I have never seen such a bright light before. Moreover, you walked out of the light. Hence, you must be a celestial being,” the young man said insistently.

“Haha. If you wish to think of it that way, then I am a celestial being,” Jian Wushuang giggled and looked down, “Little kid, what’s your name?”

“I am Chen Hu from the Chen family village. The people in the village call me Hu Zi,” the young man said.

“Chen family village?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“My village is at the foot of this mountain. Old celestial being, do you want me to bring you there?” the young man Chen Hu said.

“Sure, I will take a look,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Under Chen Hu’s guidance, Jian Wushuang walked toward the village at the foot of the mountain.

It was an ordinary, simple village. Jian Wushuang came to a bamboo house in the village.

Within the bamboo house, there was a middle-aged, married woman as well as a four to five-year-old small little girl with a ponytail.

“Mother, I met an old celestial being today and I have brought him with me,” Chen Hu ran in front of the middle-aged married woman excitedly.

The middle-aged old man caressed Chen Hu’s head and looked at Jian Wushuang at once. After that, she said with embarrassment: “I’m sorry, old mister. This little kid is not sensible. You are?”

“I’m just a traveler passing by this area. As for my name, I’m Wu Chen.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

Wu Chen… Walking in a world and not leaving behind any dust or mark. This was what Jian Wushuang wanted.

“Mister Wu Chen, you are travelling at the big mountain alone? Aren’t you scared of the mountain bandits?” Chen Hu’s mother asked.

“Mountain bandits?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, this mountain is very huge and there are more than a hundred villages like our Chen family village. Of course, there is also quite a number of mountain bandits within the big mountain. These mountain bandits will rob anyone throughout the year. If someone were to not give them money, he would suffer under their hands. Also, Hu Zi’s father died in their hands,” Chen Hu’s mother said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly.

“Let’s not talk about this. The sun has already set. If I’m not wrong, old mister, you have not taken your meal yet, right? I have just finished preparing our meal and you can join us if you want,” Chen Hu’s mother laughed and invited Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Eat?” Jian Wushuang had a puzzled expression.

For cultivators, Spiritual Energy in the universe served as their food. On ordinary days, they would at most have the luck to eat a few special fruits or a few special good foods that were delicious.

As for eating to fill the stomach, Jian Wushuang had not done it ever since he became a cultivator.

“I gratefully accept,” Jian Wushuang laughed and accepted the invitation.

Plain tea and simple food.

However, Jian Wushuang ate it with great relish.

After the meal, it was night time and a bright moon was high up in the sky.

Jian Wushuang sat at a spot halfway up the big mountain and looked down at the brightly lit, peaceful village which was below him.

“Compared to cultivators, ordinary humans are indeed weak and it would not be an understatement to call them ants.”

“However, cultivators have their own benefits and ordinary humans have their own benefits. At the very least, among the cultivators, not many of them can live such a peaceful life.”

With a smile, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes.

One night passed.

Early in the morning, at the crack of dawn, the peaceful village was already very lively. Many men of the village had appeared at the average-sized drill ground at the center of the village. They then took out their own weapons to train. Moreover, most of them trained with longspears. However, most of their spears were wooden longspears and only a few people possessed metal spears.

Jian Wushuang also went to the drill ground to take a look at the different spear skills that the people were training. Their spear skills were the simplest front stabs, carrying the spears and walking for a long distance as well as swinging the spears around.

Although it was ordinary, they could unleash a considerable amount of power if they were to practice continuously.

The pitiful thing was that the people within the Chen family village were all ordinary people. Thus, they were using the strength of a normal person. The strongest person could only lift a weight of a hundred Jin at maximum. Moreover, there was not even a martial artist.

“Ha!””Hmph!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Eight-year-old Chen Hu was also holding a wooden spear that was taller than him and he was practicing with the adults. His eyes were very determined. Although he was young, his spear skills were executed amazingly with impressive strength.

After a long time, the collective training ended and next was individual training.

“Hu Zi, come over here,” Jian Wushuang waved.

Hu Zi carried the long spear and ran over, “Old mister, what’s wrong?”

After one night, Chen Hu knew that Jian Wushuang was not an old celestial being. However, he still treated Jian Wushuang with respect.

“You like to use a spear?” Jian Wushuang looked at Chen Hu and asked.

“Yes. Not only me, but most of the people in the village like to use spears. For example, my father also used to use a spear. Moreover, his spear skills were remarkable,” Chen Hu said.

“How remarkable?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Not many people in the village could compete with him,” Chen Hu revealed a proud expression. However, his expression changed after that, “Old mister, do you know spear skills?”

“Yes…” after muttering to himself for some time, Jian Wushuang nodded his head, “I know quite a few.”

Jian Wushuang was speaking the truth. Although he had only trained in Sword Principles, he also had some understanding of the other weapons. The only problem was that he was not proficient in them.

However, with his realm, even a small understanding would be at the level of a Sect Master in the Qing Tian Mystery Land.

“Old mister, you really know of spear skills?” Chen Hu was delighted and his voice attracted the attention of quite a number of people around him.

A number of the villagers then walked over to him.

“Mister Chen Hu, you know of spear skills?”

“Could you be a martial artist?”

The villagers also knew that Jian Wushuang was a traveler who had just happened to pass by and his name was Wu Chen.

After seeing the villagers walking over, Jian Wushuang smiled, “I am not a martial artist. However, I know of some spear skills.”

“That’s great. Old mister, could you help me to see this spear that I made myself?”

A tough, stocky man asked delightedly. After that, he immediately executed the three-move spear skill in front of Jian Wushuang.
