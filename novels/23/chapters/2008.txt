2009 Three-Emperors World

In the boundless void, a boundless stretch of blue sky with white clouds.

At the very end of the void, burble. The void was distorted, then there were four figures that came out.

“We’re out!”

“We are finally out.”

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qiao let out a breath of relief.

They were in a region covered under prohibitions earlier and they had to keep their guards up. They didn’t dare to let loose at all.

Until then, they finally walked out from the region covered under prohibitions.

“This is…” the four of them looked at the surrounding void in shock.

Everything they saw was peaceful.

It was entirely different from the dark millstone that was constantly spinning and destroying everything on the outside.

“As expected, there is something different inside,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Could there be a territory for human cultivators in the dark nirvana?” Emperor Jiu Qiao creased his eyebrows and asked.

“The dark millstone is so huge. The moment it appeared, it was already of the size of a holy kingdom. With such a great size, it isn’t strange for there to be human cultivators,” Abysmal Saint Master replied. “Let’s go, let’s search around.”

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

Then, the four of them started searching the region.

When they were searching, they realized that the universe that they were in had great cultivation environment. Although it couldn’t compare favorably with Green Fire World, it was slightly stronger than the ten cultivation sanctuaries in Eternal Chaotic World.

In no time, they saw a city in which humans resided.

The city was quite big and there were countless human cultivators.

The four of them stood in the void near the city and they concealed their auras.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s conceal skill is pretty good. When we use this, even a Great Emperor might not be able to find us if they pass by,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

“It is great if we use it when we are hiding. If we are in front of our enemy, they will be able to tell our realm at first glance,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

“The three of us are Great Emperors and we are too eye-catching. This soul probing mission will be yours then,” Abysmal Saint Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse. He immediately spread his soul power. In an instant, he covered the entire city before him.

The cultivators in the city appeared in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised, “The quality of the cultivators in the dark millstone is quite high. Many of the cultivators in this city are close to Universe God level and there are many Real Gods too. However, the strongest among them was only a Chaotic Real God.”

“Chaotic Real God? That’s too weak. We wouldn’t get any valuable information from him. Let’s search further. The cultivation environment here is so great, there must be many Almighties. Let’s figure out a way to find one,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

The other three nodded in agreement.

The four of them didn’t stay in the city but immediately continued to search the border of the city.

Before long, the four of them had found the first Almighty in the dark millstone.

The Almighty was merely a Sir God and he was also in the city.

In a tall pavilion.

A middle-aged man in a black robe sat there with his eyes closed while he enjoyed a glass of wine in his hands.

Suddenly… Swoosh!

There was a figure that appeared behind the middle-aged man in a black robe without any sign.

“Who is it?” The middle-aged man in a black robe was shocked and instantly kept his guard up.

As he turned, he saw a young man in a crimson robe with a sword smiling at him.

“I have something that I’d like to ask you. I hope you can answer me with full honesty,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

The middle-aged man in a black robe noticed that Jian Wushuang’s aura was only in Early Stage Chaotic Realm (Sir God) level, he became less vigilant. However, his face became cold, “Humph. Although I don’t know who you are, aren’t you too rude to question me?”

“Rude?” Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose and the next moment, hong!!!

There was a bolt of terrifying divine might that pressed on the middle-aged man in a black robe.

The middle-aged man in a black robe was originally pissed off at Jian Wushuang’s rude intrusion and tone, but the pressing of the divine might shook him.

He was even shivering in fear.

“Such divine might… Middle Stage Chaotic Realm or at least peak Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. He might even be at the peak of Chaotic Realm!”

“My goodness!”

The middle-aged man in a black robe was astonished and he looked terrified.

“Now, do you still think that I’m rude?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Master of Double dragon region, Tian Xingzi greets mister. Go ahead and ask me any questions. I will tell you everything I know,” the middle-aged man in a black robe said politely.

“As expected. No matter which part of the world I am in, power speaks for itself. It is as such in Eternal Chaotic World and the same applies to the internal world inside the dark millstone,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows as he began to question.

He naturally asked questions about the universe.

The middle-aged man in a black robe, also the Master of Double dragon region, Tian Xingzi answered frankly.

Then, Jian Wushuang finally had a basic understanding of the universe.

The universe that he was in was a big world. A completely huge world that existed for a very long time.

The big world was named Three-Emperors World!

The name was said to derive from the legend whereby there were three experts that appeared in the world before and the three experts were referred to as the three emperors. Over the years, they were worshipped by countless experts in the world. The myth said that Three-Emperors World was made by the three emperors.

As time flew past, the three emperors were nowhere to be seen.

The layout of the Three-Emperors World was very clear too. The territories were segregated into three different levels.

The first level, which was the base, was called a region.

Region could also be explained as territories. In a region, there would be cities in various sizes and also countless cultivators. In every region, there would be a master that was widely acknowledged. The masters of the region were mostly experts of an early stage Chaotic Realm, also known as Sir God level in Eternal Chaotic World. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Above region, there was God Mansion!

Legend said that there was a total of one thousand and three hundred regions in Three-Emperor World.

The one thousand and three hundred regions formed eighty-four God Mansions. Each God Mansion ruled over ten regions and every God Mansion had a master as well. The master of God Mansion was normally an expert in Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, also known as Emperor God in Eternal Chaotic World!
