4665 The Reason for the Clay Idol

More than 100 Heaven’s Favorites were selected from the Ancient Path of Stars. They stayed in the Cloud Palace and reached the Supreme realm after 100,000 years.

They did not see Cosmos God. That was because he had heard from the red-lipped and white-teethed Little Daoist that the Cosmic God was still in deep sleep and had no idea when he would wake up.

However, their goal was no longer the qualifications to sit on the futon and listen to the Dao, but the more desirable disciple’s seat.

The Path of the Heavenly Gate, which was established by Cosmos God and had stricter conditions, was the only way to obtain a seat as Cosmos God’s disciple.

One could only see the top existences of the Divine Power Universe in the great Path of the Heavenly Gate.

It was said that there were True Shadows of existences that surpassed the Invincible Supremes on the Path of the Heavenly Gate. Even if one stepped into it to cultivate, it would be fate.

Countless cultivators yearned to rise above the rest on the Ancient Path of Stars and step into the Path of the Heavenly Gate. Naturally, the competition was far more intense than the Ancient Path of Stars.

Heavenly Performance Platform, Cloud Palace.

In an exquisite Daoist Rite Temple at the top of the clouds, Old Master, Supreme Xue Bo, Ninth Kalpa King, Feng Qi, Long Yan, Long Chi, and the others were all sitting together, sipping tea and watching the clouds.

Jian Wushuang, who was still in deep sleep, was also sitting on the stage, drinking tea secretly.

“It’s so comfortable here. Drinking tea with my old friends is much more comfortable than teaching the way,” Jian Wushuang said leisurely.

Everyone laughed. Feng Qi curled her lips and said, “You’ve been drinking this tea for more than 100,000 years. Are you still not tired of it?”

Jian Wushuang took another sip with a smile, “Of course not. This tea is a treasure from the Chaos Tea Tree in the True Sword Sect. It’s especially good for the spleen and stomach.”

When the rest of the people heard this explanation, they almost spat out the tea in their mouths.

This guy, who was already standing at the peak of the entire universe and even controlled the Heavenly Dao, actually wanted to drink tea to protect his spleen and stomach.

However, on second thought, the fact that Cosmos Gods liked to drink tea could also be considered a hobby they had found in their boring days.

After drinking tea for more than ten years, Jian Wushuang said seriously, “Everyone, I’ll leave everything in the Cloud Palace to you.”

Putting down his teacup, Supreme Xue Bo asked, “Lord Cosmos God, are you preparing to do this?”

“I’m preparing to head to the heavens and look for that clay idol that disappeared in the Cangwu Platform,” Jian Wushuang said.

Feng Qi hurriedly said, “But it’s already been a million years, and that thing still hasn’t shown any signs of appearing. Could it have already died out?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head, “It’s because of this that I’m uneasy. If it continues to grow, the consequences will be unimaginable. I don’t want the Divine Power Universe to be in turmoil again.”

Feng Qi’s lips were tightly pursed. Obviously, she also knew the importance of this matter.

After all, Lu Ding’s clay idol was too strange. It was formed by absorbing the blood essence of nearly ten million cultivators.

“I’ll go with you.” Without waiting for Feng Qi to speak, Ninth Kalpa King, who rarely spoke but was extremely serious, spoke.

The current Ninth Kalpa King had already broken through that layer of shackles and reached the terrifying Half Ancestral realm after obtaining Cosmos God’s Great Dao Comprehension a million years ago. His entire person was like a heavy sword that had a hidden edge, but no one dared to question his sharpness.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and patted his shoulder with a smile, “Good Brother, although I want you to go with me, I can’t let you forsake the training at the Path of the Heavenly Gate. You’re helping me by guarding that place.”

“Just let Elder Jun Fu guard that place,” Ninth Kalpa King said.

Supreme Jun Fu shook his head repeatedly. “I’m not going. I’m getting old and I need to rest more before I can continue fighting alongside Cosmos God.”

“You, please help me keep an eye on the Path of the Heavenly Gate. I’ll go with Old Master and finish it quickly. We’ll be back soon.” Jian Wushuang laughed as he hugged Ninth Kalpa King.

“Alright, you have to come back within a million years. By then, the cultivators on the Path of the Heavenly Gate should also come out,” Ninth Kalpa King said.

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “Come on, let’s drink for another year. I’ll leave after a year.”

A year later, two figures walked out of the Cloud Palace on the clouds and headed to the clouds.

In the clouds, Jian Wushuang, who was dressed like a Ranger, looked at Old Master beside him and said, “Old Master, I want to ask you something.”

“I know what you want to ask. All the information about that clay idol?” Compared to millions of years ago, Old Master’s unapproachable aura had almost disappeared. At this time, he was like a sect elder who liked to doze off, with a bit of peace.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “I still don’t understand why Lu Ding, who has already reached the peak, would do that.”

“That’s because he has reached the point where he has no choice but to do so.” Old Master looked into the distance and said faintly, “His strength and cultivation realm have already reached a point where it can not be hidden. It has far exceeded the Ancestor realm.”

“What? Beyond the Ancestor realm?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “There are more than just Ancestor realm experts at the peak of the universe?!”

“If the pinnacle of the universe is the Ancestor realm, then what am I?” Old Master said calmly, “He, who comprehended from the Spring of Chaos, should have naturally borrowed that power and reached the peak of this universe.”

“He controlled that power, so he naturally knew the ultimate truth and the limits of everything. That’s why he used that method.”

“Using the divine blood of billions of living beings to forge a divine body. Using this as the body of the mortal body that you shed, you can retain your complete power and Ascend there.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. Old Master had made it very clear that the reason why Lu Ding had lured and killed tens of millions of cultivators was to forge a divine body and act as the mortal body that he should have shed so that he could retain all his power.

What exactly was in that unknown place that made Lu Ding so inhumane?

The two of them fell silent. After a long time, Jian Wushuang suddenly said, “Before Lu Ding died, he said something to me. He said that I would also reach this level one day. Is it true?”

Old Master did not answer. Instead, he called Jian Wushuang’s name, which was a rare occurrence. “Wushuang, do you remember the three promises we made?”

Jian Wushuang nodded. “I remember.”

“Then, does it still count?”

“It definitely counts.” Jian Wushuang nodded firmly. Then, he seemed to have understood something and said, “Let’s start after we finish this.”

Old Master smiled and said, “There’s no hurry. I’ve been asleep for god knows how long. It’s fine to wait a little longer.”
