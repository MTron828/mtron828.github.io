Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m a man of my word. 30,000 universe origin stones and this matter will be settled,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wait here for a moment.” Thunder God Palace Master immediately returned to Thunder God Palace and began to prepare the 30,000 universe origin stones.

30,000 universe origin stones was not a small amount. Although Thunder God Palace could afford it, it was still a great loss.

After a while, Thunder God Palace Master returned to Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he brought an interspatial ring and gave it to Jian Wushuang.

“30,000 universe origin stones are all here,” Thunder God Palace Master said.

Jian Wushuang glanced at it briefly and nodded slightly.

“Thunder God Palace Master, where is the woman named Eighth now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“She has opened a small tavern in the Dusty Rain Star World. Over the years, our Thunder God Palace has sent experts to protect her in secret. After all, I promised Xuan Yi that I would protect her, so I won’t go back on my words,” Thunder God Palace Master said.

“You’re smart.” Jian Wushuang smiled and left immediately.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang had finally left, Thunder God Palace Master and many experts in Thunder God Palace heaved a sigh of relief.

“This terrifying guy has finally left.” Blood Thunder General said with lingering fear.

Although Jian Wushuang had left, it had to be said that Thunder God Palace had indeed suffered a setback this time.

…

After leaving Thunder God Palace, Jian Wushuang headed directly to the Dusty Rain Star World. Leng Rushuang naturally followed him.

The Dusty Rain Star World was an ordinary second-class Star World under the control of the Thunder God Palace. There was a tavern in a city in this Star World.

The tavern was small and very simple, but there were many customers in the tavern.

In fact, many of these customers came for the lady boss of the tavern.

“Look, the lady boss is really beautiful!”

“She’s more than beautiful. Her face and figure are simply perfect.”

“Unfortunately, she was born a slave. She always has a special mark on her hand that represents her status as a slave. She will never be able to remove it. If she doesn’t have this mark, she would be even more perfect.”

Whispers could be heard in the tavern.

Many heated gazes would occasionally look at the plain-robed lady in front of the tavern counter.

That lady had a slender figure. Although she was only wearing a simple plain robe, it was unable to conceal her almost perfect figure. Coupled with her devastatingly beautiful face, it felt as if a goddess had fallen into the mortal world.

In terms of appearance, this lady’s appearance was undoubtedly enough to shock the world. It was likely that in the entire Dusty Rain heavenly world, it would be difficult to find a second person whose appearance was comparable to hers.

It was precisely because of this that the business of this tavern was so good. Those customers had come to this tavern in order to meet this lady boss. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Right at this moment…

“You are the lady boss of this tavern?” A voice that carried a hint of arrogance suddenly rang out.

Within the tavern, the whispers immediately stopped. Those customers’ gazes immediately turned toward the source of the voice. When they clearly saw the appearance of that person, most of these customers revealed playful smiles.

The person who had spoken was a young man dressed in luxurious clothes. Behind him were two guards. The two guards had extremely powerful auras, and they were actually two Rulers.

Being able to have two Rulers act as guards was enough to prove that this young man had an extraordinary background.

The beautiful woman who had been busy at the counter all this time raised her head slightly and glanced at the young man. Then, she lowered her head again and continued to do her own thing.

“Tsk tsk, I’ve long heard that there is an extremely beautiful lady boss in this tavern. Seeing her today, she really didn’t disappoint me.” The young man smiled. “Miss, my name is He Yun. My father is Ruler Wan Yan, and he controls countless territories under his command. A beauty like you shouldn’t be a lady boss in a small tavern in this city. Why don’t you come back with me? I guarantee that you can do whatever you want in this Dusty Rain heavenly world. Won’t that be a great pleasure?”

This young man, He Yun, spoke with absolute confidence.

He did indeed have such confidence. His father, Ruler Wan Yan, could indeed be considered an overlord in this Dusty Rain heavenly world.

However, after He Yun finished speaking, that absolute beauty still lowered her head and busied herself with the matters in her hands, completely ignoring him.

This caused He Yun’s expression to stiffen slightly. His expression was also rather awkward. However, after the awkwardness, it was replaced by anger.

“Miss, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. I, He Yun, have never been unable to obtain a woman that I want.” He Yun’s voice was ice-cold. The two guards behind him also stared coldly at the absolute beauty.

Clearly, as long as the absolute beauty did not agree, they would directly attack.

However, they did not notice that the customers in the inn were all looking at them with pity, especially He Yun.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly erupted. This aura had reached the fourth level Ruler level, instantly suppressing He Yun and his two guards.

The two guards, who were only at the first level Ruler level, immediately revealed terrified expressions. Their bodies trembled as they trembled.

As for He Yun, he was only a Ruler of principles. At this moment, the crystal was suppressed to the ground.

“Get lost, or die!” A cold voice sounded in the ears of He Yun and the other two.

He Yun’s two guards were scared out of their wits. They immediately dragged He Yun and left in a sorry state.

After the three of them left, that aura slowly disappeared.

When the guest in the tavern saw this scene, he was no longer surprised.

“Tsk tsk, that He Yun just now was really in a sorry state.”

“Haha, he’s also stupid. Before snatching her away, he didn’t even inquire about the identity of this lady boss. She had the experts of the Thunder God Palace personally guard her. Not to mention that his father is only a fourth-tier Ruler of the Dusty Rain heavenly world, even if the number one expert of the Dusty Rain Heavenly World came, he probably wouldn’t dare to lay his eyes on her.”

“If I remember correctly, this He Yun should be the twenty-first person to be scared out of his wits in all these years.”

The guests in the tavern chatted and laughed casually.

They all lived in this city, so naturally, they knew a bit about the identity of this tavern’s lady boss.

They knew that the background and background of this tavern’s lady boss was not something that the people in the Dusty Rain Star World could afford to provoke.

Just as He Yun was scared off, three figures slowly walked in from the entrance of the tavern. After the three of them arrived, they went directly to the tavern counter, which was in front of the absolute beauty.
