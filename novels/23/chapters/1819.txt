Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Hall Master Yuan’s bright and clear voice reverberated in the entire hall.

“Lineage of Star is now facing the biggest danger in history. Not only from those forces and experts who harbor deep-seated hatred against Lineage of Star, but we also have to watch out for the forces and experts who have cast greedy eyes over the Secret Skill of Star Palace and White Blaze Fruit Tree. Besides, there are also people who didn’t hope for Jian Wushuang to grow stronger and want to kill him ahead of time!”

“Once the news about Palace Master’s death spreads, they might all turn into jackals and wolves and charge at Lineage of Star!!”

Hearing what Hall Master Yuan had said, Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Nie Yun and Hall Master Gu Xin looked solemn.

“The reason why Palace Master did everything possible to obtain the opportunity in Seven Star Realm was that he saw the hidden danger in Lineage of Star. The danger has revealed itself gradually over the recent years. Hence, Master Palace wanted to break through and become a Great Emperor through the opportunities. Only when a Great Emperor attends garrison duty personally could he ensure Lineage of Star’s safety.”

“But it is a pity that Palace Master passed away because of this.”

Then, Hall Master Yuan clenched his hands and his body quivered.

The other three Hall Master felt extremely distressed as well.

Especially Jian Wushuang…

Master of Star Palace had been in a hurry to become a Great Emperor, most likely was to protect him!

Hall Master Yuan took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He then announced solemnly, “Before Palace Master passed away, he sent the four of us a message. According to his order, from today onwards, Jian Wushuang will be the new Master of Star Palace. Gu Xin, Nie Yun, do you have any opinion about this?”

“No,” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yin replied without hesitation. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Wushuang’s talent and power were on display, he was listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

Plus, all his contributions to Lineage of Star were well known too. The White Blaze Fruit Tree had been obtained by Jian Wushuang alone.

As they were satisfied with all aspects and it had been an order from the Master of Star Palace before he died, they naturally didn’t have any objection.

“If so,” Hall Master Yuan turned to bow at Jian Wushuang, “Yuan greets Palace Master!”

“Gu Xi greets Palace Master!”

“Nie Yun greets Palace Master!”

The three Hall Masters bowed at Jian Wushuang with great respect.

“Please get up,” Jian Wushuang waved and the three of them got up.

“At such a crucial moment, I shall not behave unreasonably. From today, I will be the new Palace Master of Lineage of Star. The danger and difficulties that Lineage of Star is going to encounter, I will be the first to take them on,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was bright and clear, with a tinge of determination. Then, he waved and two flowing lights appeared in the hall.

The two flowing lights were two brawny figures. One was bronze-armored and the other one was silver-armored.

“Palace Master, this is…?”

The three Hall Masters looked confused.

“These are Dao soldiers. I brought them back. Their nature is similar to a war puppet’s. The only difference is that they are more powerful. Hall Master Nie Yun, go ahead and try them yourself. Try their power,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Alright,” Hall Master Nie Yun nodded.

In the lofty hall, Hall Master Nie Yun fought with the two Dao soldiers.

He first fought with the bronze-armored Dao soldier.

Although the Dao soldier wasn’t weak, it didn’t know close combat skills. When it was fighting with Hall Master Nie Yun, it was hit and flew off from Hall Master Nie Yun’s attack. However, the bronze-armored Dao soldier flew out over ten times but didn’t seem to take any damage.

Hall Master Nie Yun stopped very soon.

“Haha, this Dao soldiers was quite durable. I hit it so many times and it was still complete,” Hall Master Nie Yun laughed heartily.

“Try another one,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

Very soon, Hall Master Nie Yun and the silver-armored Dao soldiers fought.

Then, Hall Master Nie Yun wasn’t as at ease as before.

One should know that silver-armored Dao soldier’s power was at the level of an Emperor God.

Even though it only knew simple attacks, it cornered Hall Master Nie Yun badly.

Hall Master Nie Yun had already showed all his power but he continued to retreat from the Dao soldier’s attack.

“Stop, stop!” Hall Master Nie Yun shouted.

Jian Wushuang immediately commanded the silver-armored Dao soldier to stop.

“How is it?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Very strong, this war puppet. No, this Dao soldier. His attack was too strong and has definitely already reached the level of Emperor God. Such a Dao soldier might not be comparable with a true Emperor God but it is definitely stronger than some top Sir Gods,” Hall Master Nie Yun said.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin nodded their heads by the side.

Although they had never fought with the Dao soldiers, they could see from the exchange between the Dao soldiers and Hall Master Nie Yun.

“I have to tell the three of you, I have quite a few of these Dao soldiers on hand,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“What?” Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, and Hall Master Nie Yun were stunned and immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master, when you said quite a few, how many is a few?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Firstly, I have a hundred of bronze armored Dao soldiers. As for silver-armored Dao soldiers, I have less. I only have four of them,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Back then, he had taken a hundred and thirty-two Dao soldiers from around Wu Hun’s dead body. However, during the time when he was wandering in the past six thousand years, as he had needed some Dao soldiers to explore the way, he had damaged some. On top of that, he had also left some Dao soldiers in Green Fire World before he left. Hence, he had only brought back a hundred and four Dao soldiers when he had returned to Lineage of Star.

“A hundred, a hundred and four Dao soldiers?”

Hall Master Yuan was dumbfounded.

Or it should be said that he was shocked by the unexpected surprise.

Although the bronze-armored Dao soldiers weren’t strong, its power was definitely at a Sir God-level. As long as four to five joined forces, they should be able to match evenly with a Sir God. Jian Wushuang had a hundred such Dao soldiers?

In other words, Jian Wushuang controlled the fighting power of about twenty Sir Gods.

Besides, there were four silver-armored Dao soldiers. The silver-armored Dao soldiers had the power of an Emperor God. One of them could easily suppress Hall Master Nie Yun.

The total of all Dao soldiers would be a fierce force!

Hall Master Yuan took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in himself. He asked, “Palace Master, where did you get these Dao soldiers?”

“Let’s not talk about how I got them for now. In short, I control all the Dao soldiers and they definitely follow my commands. Besides, I took control of another expert via a unique method. He is now my sword servant and I brought him back to Lineage of Star as well. He is now in Sword Star. As for his power… He is slightly stronger than I am now,” Jian Wushuang said.
