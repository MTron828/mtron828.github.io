Jian Wushuang’s name eventually came to be known among many Jin Kingdom experts who had been fighting on the battlefield.

“Isn’t Jian Wushuang someone who appears to be a mere expert of Sword Principle at the level of Eternal Realm? Yet his strength can rival an advanced Celestial Master, enough to make Qu Yang hold him in high regard?”

“I think he’s probably a Celestial Master. He can’t be a mere Eternal Realm expert.”

“Well, the world is full of wonders. He has only reached the level of Eternal Realm, but it’s entirely possible that he has come across some great fortune or possessed some special skills that gave him access to greater power. That would explain everything.”

Everyone had different opinions upon hearing the news about Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, when the Celestial Masters from the Jin Kingdom residing in the mountains that contained Life Elixirs heard the news,their expressions turned grim.

“Since Jian Wushuang has arrived in this area, it’s possible that we’ll run into him. We should be careful.”

Two medium Celestial Masters from the Jin Kingdom were discussing Jian Wushuang. “You’re right. If Qu Yang holds him in high regard, he must be on the same level as Qu Yang. Perhaps he has even surpassed Qu Yang. Considering our strength, we best be on guard if we run into him,” one of them said.

Of course, there were those who did not take the matter seriously.

One vulgar man standing in the middle of mountains sneered. “Jian Wushuang? Humph! I don’t care if he’s in the Eternal Realm! I better not see him or I’ll crush him into pieces.”

“Peerless genius? Even with such great talent, he’d be nothing once dead,” a graceful girl clad in golden armor said coldly.

Jian Wushuang’s name became widespread in the Jin Kingdom after high-level leaders spread the news.

However, Jian Wushuang was blissfully unaware of it. He continued to explore the area, looking for Life Elixirs all alone.

Occasionally, he would encounter Jin Kingdom experts and would never hesitate to fight and try his best to beat them. Even if he failed, he considered it a chance to practice his swordsmanship through fierce battles.

No opponent, except for Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm or a team of several advanced Celestial Masters, could threaten him. He was now stronger than ever.

In fact, those experts could only hurt him. They would be daydreaming if they thought they could kill him.

He was so confident in his strength that he had no qualms about openly flying around the mountains.

Before he knew, he had remained in this area for 17 years.

In the beginning of his time here, so few experts came to the area that it was highly unlikely for him to run into them. It also gave him a better chance of finding Life Elixirs.

Later on, however, more and more experts arrived. Obviously, it became easier to run into them and thus, the higher the chances of battle.

Now, he would essentially encounter an expert a month. He chose to fight each time, given that his opponent was not terribly strong.

In the past 17 years, he had fought dozens of fierce battles of varying magnitude in this area but killed only two in the process. Even then, it was their arrogance that led them to their death.

Besides experience gained from those battles, he also managed to acquire 11 Life Elixirs.

He found eight Life Elixirs on his own and obtained the rest from the two experts who had been killed off.

He could use those elixirs to create 11 Celestial Masters. If he were to pass them to the Fire Points Exchange Office, he could get 110,000 Fire Points in return. It was a great harvest for him.

“While these Life Elixirs are precious, the experience I gained for my Sword Principle within these 17 years is far more valuable.” Jian Wushuang flew slowly as he talked to Gu King.

There was a trace of a smile on his face. He was obviously pleased.

“Since you’ve developed three Daos of the Creation Level, your next step is to figure out a way to advance one of them to the strongest level,” Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned. “The strongest Sword Principle…”

Before he entered the battlefield, he had pushed both the Coalescence Sword Principle and Speed Sword Principle to the?Creation Level. The Scarlet Yang Sword Principle remained at the Universe Level. However, he had discovered the method to break through into that level when he was in Tai Qing Palace.

While fighting alone on the battlefield all these years, he had also been meditating and working on the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle. He fought more Jin Kingdom experts than ever, especially after coming here. As a result, he eventually found the breakthrough for the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle.

Now, this Dao had completely combined Yin and Yang to form the Yin-Yang Sword Principle.

The Yin-Yang Sword Principle was the last of his Daos to be at the Creation Level. Not only did the power of his Sword Principle that he could exercise increase, but his overall strength had also improved significantly.

“I spent a lot of time and energy advancing the Daos to the Creation Level. God knows how long it will take if I want to further it to the strongest level.” Jian Wushuang laughed while shaking his head.

“It’s essentially difficult to develop the strongest Sword Principle since one at the Creation Level can hardly match up to it. Your father entered a Secret Land and cultivated for 100,000 years to complete this. Moreover, he also has an advantage in having the body of a Sword Spirit and exceptional talent. You’re equally talented, but your cultivation time is still too short!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“So, take it easy,” Gu King said.

“I’m not too worried about advancing my Sword Principles but I won’t be able to make a realm breakthrough if I don’t develop a strongest Sword Principle. In fact, I can become a Dao Master right away, but I have to suppress it on purpose. It isn’t exactly easy for me,” Jian Wushuang said with a wry smile.

He had long met the requirements of becoming a Dao Master but he was ambitious. He wanted to first develop the strongest Sword Principle and made it his foundation. Doing so would mean that his potential and strength could go even further in the future.

“Hang in there. If you want to make progress, you must suppress your own realm. But you needn’t worry about it much. You’ll be able to break through your bottleneck once any of the three Sword Principles reaches the strongest level,” Gu King explained.

“You only need to make one Sword Principle your foundation in order to become a Dao Master. Once you’ve made your choice, you won’t be able to improve the chosen Sword Principle anymore but you can still work on the other two.”
