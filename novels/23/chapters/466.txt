Chapter 467: War God Di Jing under the Command of Emperor Xiao!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All experts who had adventured in the Flaming Battlefield had heard of Great Demon Di Jing.

After all, the Flaming Battlefield originated from him.

A thousand years ago, he had been attacked by eight marquises and 322 lords on the Flaming Battlefield. Both sides had perished. The battle was a legend in Divine Land.

Now this skinny elder claimed that he was Great Demon Di Jing?

“He caught me easily no matter how I struggled. His strength must be beyond that of marquises. A supreme expert like him who appeared on the Flaming Battlefield... Yes, he must be Di Jing,”?Jian Wushuang thought quickly.

He recalled the legendary battle on the Flaming Battlefield a thousand years ago. Di Jing had been assumed dead because he had disappeared, while the eight marquises and 322 lords had died.

However, no one had witnessed Great Demon Di Jing’s death and his body had never been found.

It was absolutely credible that Di Jing was still alive.

Reflecting on the skinny elder’s astonishing strength, Jian Wushuang was 90 percent sure that he was Di Jing.

Knowing his identity, Jian Wushuang became uneasy.

Di Jing had been recognized as the Great Demon a thousand years ago because of the frantic slaughter he had wrought. That was why so many experts had launched a collaborative attack on him. As he stood before the Great Demon, Jian Wushuang was worried that Di Jing might kill him just because he disliked his appearance.

Or he might kill him just because he felt like it.

If Di Jing wanted to kill him, Jian Wushuang would definitely be unable to resist.

Jian Wushuang was on high alert.

As though he had read Jian Wushuang’s mind, Di Jing rolled his cold, strange eyes and snorted. “Rest assured. I’m not going to kill you for the moment.”

“For the moment?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Boy, let me ask you something. You must answer honestly. If I’m satisfied with your answer, I may spare your life,” Di Jing said coldly.

“Please ask,” Jian Wushuang calmly replied.

He knew that Di Jing had seized him from among the experts in the cave mansion for a specific reason.

“Boy, where did you get the Icy Heart Poison venom?” Di Jing stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Icy Heart Poison venom?” Jian Wushuang now understood that Di Jing’s reasons for seizing him.

With this in mind, he replied truthfully,” I obtained it by refining part of Icy Heart Poison in someone’s body.”

“Refine?” Di Jing was a little stunned, “You know how to refine Icy Heart Poison?”

“For some special reason, I can refine it, but only a very limited part,” Jian Wushuang said.

Di Jing continued to ask,” What’s your relationship with the person with Icy Heart Poison?”

“Well...” Jian Wushuang hesitated before answering, “We’re sort of friends. She had once helped me, and I helped her to detoxify the poison, too.”

“I see,” Di Jing nodded and murmured,” No wonder I can feel a young master’s aura on you. I guess my young master has given you a pledge?”

“A pledge?”

Jian Wushuang immediately recalled the Jade Slip which Leng Rushuang had given him.

Leng Rushuang mentioned that he could break the Jade Slip when he was in danger.

“Young master?” Jian Wushuang looked at Di Jing with a strange expression on his face and asked,” She’s your young master?”

“Yes,” Di Jing nodded. A faint smile appeared on his thin and sunken face. Di Jing continued,” Boy, stand closer.”

Jian Wushuang frowned and hesitated.

“Boy, don’t be afraid. Since my young master gave you her pledge, she must have a close relationship with you. Naturally, I won’t kill you. In any case, if I did want to kill you, I’d be able to do it?even if you’re a thousand miles away,” Di Jing said with a smile.

Recalling how Di Jing had seized him, Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

Indeed, with Di Jing’s incredible skills, he could kill him no matter where Jian Wushuang hid.

Jian Wushuang shook off his hesitation and walked to stand in front of Di Jing.

“I haven’t talked to anyone for over a thousand years,” Di Jing sighed.

“Over a thousand years?” Jian Wushuang was surprised,” Have you stayed in this cave mansion for so long?”

“That’s right.”

Di Jing nodded and said with a sigh, “I have been meditating on Slaughter Dao. A thousand years ago, something was wrong when I comprehended it. That was why I killed so many innocent people. Without any other options, I had to cultivate it in this cave mansion. I’ve been here for a thousand years.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Everyone on the Flaming Battlefield said that Di Jing was a Great Demon who had been addicted to slaughter. A thousand years ago, he had massacred innumerable innocent people. Other experts had been enraged and had decided to band together to fight against him. No one knew the reason for Di Jing’s crazy slaughter.

“It’s rumored that you died together with those experts who attacked you,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Died together with them? Those bugs?” Di Jing sneered. “Though I was affected by Heart Demon and could only use one percent of my strength, a group of bugs of Cloud Realm couldn’t possibly harm me.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Di Jing obviously did not think highly of Cloud Realm experts.

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang was incredulous.

“Di Jing is definitely a super expert beyond the Cloud Realm. Probably, he’s even stronger than the Ten Sovereigns in Divine Land. I wonder whether he’s stronger than the Three Ancestors,”?Jian Wushuang thought in horror.

Since Di Jing was so powerful, how about Leng Rushuang, the young master of Di Jing?

Jian Wushuang knew that Leng Rushuang’s father was Di Jing’s master.

What incredible strength... would Di Jing’s master possess?

“Elder, may I ask who you and your young master are?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“You want to know?” Di Jing glanced at him and smiled faintly.

“Listen. I am the seventh War God under the command of Emperor Xiao of Tang of the East!”
