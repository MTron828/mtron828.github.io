Chapter 2701: Second-rated Force

“Alliance Master Su Han, do you want the two of us to hand over our lives to you?” Sheng Long’s expression was extremely ugly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang nodded and grinned. “Do you think that both your lives are still safe in your hands?”

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were both stupefied.

At that instance, they were still standing safely on the spot.

However, Jian Wushuang was right in front of them. He could easily kill both of them even if he did not use any of his techniques to freeze space-time with his strength at that moment.

Their life and death were indeed under Jian Wushuang’s control.

“Let me leave an oppression in your body, so I can release you without worries. I’ll soon send someone to both of your territories to take over the sites and experts under your command before integrating both of your forces into Sword Alliance in a short time. The two of you will naturally be members of the highest order in Sword Alliance when that time comes.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were extremely unwilling, they had no choice but to agree to Jian Wushuang’s request.

The two immediately gave up on struggling and allowed Jian Wushuang to leave an oppression in their bodies.

Jian Wushuang could easily kill both of them at a fickle of his mind at that moment.

“Haha, welcome on joining my Sword Alliance. You can now go.” Jian Wushuang smiled heartily.

Sheng Long sighed lightly with the Purple Dress House Master before turning around and left.

Jian Wushuang smiled even wider while he watched the two leave.

“I’ve earned so much from today’s battle,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

The banquet Corpse Palace initially held to integrate the several forces ended up benefitting the Sword Alliance in the end.

The Corpse Palace was destroyed whilst the Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House merged into the Sword Alliance.

It was equivalent to the Sword Alliance devouring all three forces in one go. All their territories would then fall under Sword Alliance’s control.

“Sword Alliance has controlled four cities after taking in the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang. Now, Sword Alliance will be controlling nine cities altogether with the three new additions—especially when considering the Corpse Palace that controls three cities!”

“Our scale is considered strong even among second-rated forces. As for the experts...”

Although Corpse Palace was destroyed, Jian Wushuang had only killed one of the two highest-level Palace Masters of the Corpse Palace while the other was chased away. Most of Corpse Palace’s experts did not suffer any damage and joined the Sword Alliance for the benefits offered. As long as they could get their desired benefits from the Sword Alliance in the future, they would stay and contribute to the Sword Alliance’s combat power.

Jian Wushuang would very soon integrate both Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House into Sword Alliance.

Once the integration was completed, the Sword Alliance would have many Heaven Ultimate Gods—many of which would be joining the Divine Sword Official Army to increase the scale and combat power of the Divine Sword Official Army. The Sword Alliance would then be no weaker than any second-rated force in terms of Heaven Ultimate Gods combat powers.

As for the ultimate level of combatant powers...

Ordinary second-rated forces had several Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods. The Sword Alliance had Jian Wushuang himself, Sheng Long, and the Purple Dress House Master. Among the three of them, Jian Wushuang was capable of handling a few Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods at one go.

Therefore, the Sword Alliance was not weaker at the highest level of combat power and might even be stronger than the average second-rated forces.

In other words, the current Sword Alliance was a second-rated force.

Regardless of its scale or overall combat power, Sword Alliance would never be weaker than those average second-rated forces.

“Second-rated forces...” Jian Wushuang’s mouth curled up slightly.

His goal was to expand the Sword Alliance to the point it could challenge the top forces. In that case, the Sword Alliance would be able to relieve some of Crimson Stone Fort’s pressure and allow Yin Su’er more time and room to deal with Crimson Stone Fort’s internal problems of the several major factions.

In addition, Jian Wushuang himself would have controlled a very strong force to help Yin Su’er in solving the internal conflicts between those big factions.

He had taken a big step toward his goal.

He secretly sighed but his expression soon became sullen once again. “Although I won a great victory in this battle and my Sword Alliance has taken advantage of it, it has also brought a lot of troubles.”

The trouble was none other than the Star Fort.

Although Star Fort was only a second-rated force, it was considered the ultimate expert among second-rate forces. Those forces were not to be trifled with.

‘Although there are many experts within the Star Fort, the Sword Alliance’s overall strength isn’t any weaker once the Sword Alliance integrates the three new forces and includes the Divine Sword Official Army into the equation. In terms of Peak Heaven Ultimate God combat powers, I’m now fearless with the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique as ninety percent of Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods aren’t my match. However, the threat of the Star Fort Master is still too great,’ thought Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not care about the Star Fort’s overall strength including those top experts it possesses.

The Sword Alliance would never become the underdog even if the Star Fort was going to fight the Sword Alliance once the three new additions joined the Sword Alliance.

The only issue that made Jian Wushuang thread carefully was the Star Fort Master.

The Star Fort Master was a true Grand Ultimate God!

A Peak Heaven Ultimate God was far incomparable to a Grand Ultimate God.

As an example, Fo Wu’s strength was extremely powerful and ranked in the top ten among the many Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods in Danyang Continent, but he was still far behind Grand Ultimate Gods.

The reason Jian Wushuang was able to kill Fo Wu was based on a technique called A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique, but the trick only worked up to Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods and had no whatsoever effects on a Grand Ultimate God. Jian Wushuang was still unable to face a Grand Ultimate God in a battle.

Unless... He could go one step further and make a breakthrough from Peak Earth Ultimate God to Heaven Ultimate God!

“Fo Wu was worthy of his high status in the Star Fort—being second only to the Fort Master—with such an extremely extraordinary net worth. There were a total of two thousand five hundred Divine Elixir Pills in the Interspatial Ring he left behind. Meanwhile, one of the Corpse Palace Masters also had nine hundred Divine Elixir Pills on hand which added up to three thousand four hundred...

“There are so many Divine Elixir Pills that it’s sufficient to help me make a breakthrough and reach the Heaven Ultimate God realm. However, it’ll take a certain amount of time for me to refine so many Divine Elixir Pills. It’ll take at least two years regardless of how I calculate. I’m afraid the Star Fort Master would have come up here in less than two years.”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

If Jian Wushuang broke through and refined the Divine Elixir Pills to reach the Heaven Ultimate God Two years later, he would no longer need to be mindful of the Star Fort Master.

The point was that the Star Fort Master might not give him so much time.
