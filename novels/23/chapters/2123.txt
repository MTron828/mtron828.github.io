Chapter 2124 The Final Hope

Bang!A deafening bang reverberated in the air. When the two attacks met, the space around cracked as though it was made of paper.

After the clash, Jian Wushuang backed off immediately. As for Demon King Chen Yu, he too took three steps back.

After the three heavy steps, Demon King Chen Yu raised his head and looked at the Demon King Chen Yu and frowned, “This brat managed to force me to back off?”

Even though he had the upper hand in this clash, it was very small.

Most importantly, the sword light forced him back.

This meant that Jian Wushuang had the power to threaten him!

“Demon King Chen Yu, that is your maximum power?” Jian Wushuang stood in the air as he smiled at Demon King Chen Yu coldly.

Rage filled his heart before he had his temper back in control.

“This brat has an extraordinary power level. It is almost impossible for me to kill him alone. My target this time is the Heaven Repairing Palace, there is no need for me to waste my time on him!” Demon King Chen Yu thought.

He moved after he made up his mind.

This time, he did not move towards Jian Wushuang. His target was the Heaven Repairing Palace.

Jian Wushuang frowned when he saw this.

“Take this, Demon King Chen Yu.”

Jian Wushuang roared as his deep voice reverberated through the battlefield. Dark jade light burst forth from the nine ancient god stars on top of his forehead as the divine power around him boiled.

“Ancient God secret skills, Moon Picking Skill!!”

Hum!!

Heaven and earth shook as the space around Demon King Chen Yu started to constrict.

As for Jian Wushuang’s current power level, the Moon Picking Skill could restrain even people like Demon King Chen Yu to a great extent.

“This secret skill…” Demon King Chen Yu was surprised.

A large, soft hand started to float towards him, as though a mother was about to touch her baby.

This large hand made Demon King Chen Yu cautious as he sensed danger.

Based on its power, it was even stronger than the sword skill that Jian Wushuang had cast.

“Even though Jian Wushuang is not a stage three great emperor, he still has many tricks up his sleeves,” Demon King Chen Yu thought as he turned even more ferocious. Wowlala~~~ monstrous clouds of demonic mist filled the sky instantly.

“Scram!”

The spacetime which constrained him exploded with a roar as he swung the blade he held in one of his hands.

A mirage of a colossal blade appeared and descended upon everyone. It tore everything in its way apart.

It instantly ripped the hand apart.

Jian Wushuang’s offense disintegrated instantly. His purpose was not to injure Demon King Chen Yu, but to halt him for a brief moment when the demon king was parrying the attack. At that instant, Jian Wushuang dashed in front of Demon King Chen Yu.

“Demon King Chen Yu, let us have a rematch.” Jian Wushuang mocked. A unique sword essence could be felt radiating from him as he managed to cut off the demon king.

As for his current power level and Sword Principle Xuan Luo, he had no problem stopping Demon King Chen Yu.

Jian Wushuang managed to block the fury of attacks by the angry Demon King Chen Yu, stopping him from getting closer to the Heaven Repairing Palace.

“Damn it!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s blood boiled as he yelled at everyone who was around him. “What are all of you doing? Go and destroy the Heaven Repairing Palace and kill everyone around here!”

Upon hearing this, the experts from Acheron Palace attacked.

This time, Acheron Palace not only sent a stage three great emperor, Demon King Chen Yu, but almost every single expert they had.

There were six great emperors.

These six great emperors simply kept Abysmal Saint Master and East Royal Emperor occupied. In reality, not all six great emperors needed to be there to get the job done.

Hence, three great emperors broke away and headed towards the Heaven Repairing Palace.

“Oh no!”

The Abysmal Saint Master and East Royal Emperor turned pale. However, they could not do anything to stop them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang, who was fighting Demon King Chen Yu, was aware of the situation around the battlefield. He grunted as he pulled out an old mirror. He used his divine power and summoned five figures with powerful auras from the mirror.

“Five war spirits, stop them.”

Jian Wushuang ordered the war spirits.

The five war spirits dashed towards the great emperors immediately and used all their might.

The five war spirits were like five great emperors.

They stopped the three great emperors immediately.

“Nice one, Sword Emperor!”

“Never would I have thought that the Sword Emperor would have such an amazing treasure.”

The Abysmal Saint Master, East Royal Emperor and everyone else heaved a sigh of relief.

It was already amazing that Jian Wushuang could possess such a treasure which allowed him to have five great emperors as helpers.

However, Jian Wushuang’s face was still solemn, even though the three great emperors had stopped.

“Five war spirits from the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror indeed have the fighting power of a stage one great emperor and can stop the few great emperors. However, there are many emperor gods this time,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Indeed, there were around twenty emperor gods apart from the seven great emperors led by Demon King Chen Yu.

Among these emperor gods, there were eight who were top tier emperor gods. The remaining were also very close to that power level.

On the side of the Sanctuary Alliance were little experts on guard. The quality of these experts were also not good compared to the Acheron Palace. At the start, they could barely stop the invaders. Now, they were completely oppressed. Many of the Emperor Gods from Acheron Palace had freed themselves and started attacking the Heaven Repairing Palace.

These emperor gods would have posed no problems on a normal day. However, no matter Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master or East Royal Emperor could not free themselves to deal with them. Only one of the war spirits could find the chance to go and stop those emperor gods.

However, that would not be effective as there were too many emperor gods.

Soon, these emperor gods appeared in front of the Heaven Repairing Palace and started to attack the palace with all their might.

Even though the power level was nothing compared to the Demon King Chen Yu, the Heaven Repairing Palace was already severely damaged by Demon King Chen Yu and was at the brink of collapsing. Even though the attacks were not very powerful, they could still potentially destroy the palace once and for all.
