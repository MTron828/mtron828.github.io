Chapter 566: Temple Master Iceberg’s Killing Intent

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Unless...” An idea crossed Jian Wushuang’s mind. His expression instantly fell when he looked toward Temple Master Iceberg.

He realized that the Temple Master had broken through the Restriction from his side, so he was nearer to him than the monster spies.

Jian Wushuang also noticed that the Temple Master was glaring at him instead of the escaping spies.

He could even see a chilling killing intent in those eyes.

“He came to kill me, not to help me!”

Jian Wushuang quickly realized the Temple Master’s true intent. He held the Heart-killing Sword tightly in one hand and drew several Marks with the other hand, quickly activating the Eighteen Levels of Hell.

At the same time, there was a light between his eyebrows, where a formidable Sword Essence was preparing to attack.

In front of him, a jade bottle filled with a milky-white liquid emerged, which turned out to be the Icy Heart Poison.

In such a short time, Jian Wushuang had already prepared his three Killing Moves.

He never gave up easily. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

If Temple Master Iceberg really dared to attack him, he would fight back with every one of his Killing Moves.

Though he knew he might not be able to kill the Temple Master, he could at least give him a tough battle.

While filled with killing intent, Temple Master Iceberg gazed closely at Jian Wushuang, giving little attention to the spies.

However, just as he was about to attack Jian Wushuang, he sensed a new aura arrive.

The aura frightened him so much that his heart could not help twitching. His eyes betrayed his fear as he changed his target without even a second thought.

“Damn you monster spies! How dare you try to kill a human Divine Emperor! Let me send you to hell.”

He roared towards the spies, his voice echoing out over the plains. Jian Wushuang was astonished when he saw him give up killing him and start hunting the spies so crazily.

“What is he doing?”?Jian Wushuang was confused.

He was quite sure that the Temple Master had come for him.

He had even prepared for a life-and-death battle, so he never thought the Temple Master would change his mind.

However, It didn’t take him long to figure out the reason because he saw a lady appear in front of the spies.

The lady looked pretty and stately in her blue dress, along with her blue hair that was hanging down to her feet. Even her eyes had a blue shine to them.

She stood still, surrounded by waving ripples of air that made the others feel as if they were floating in a sea.

Time seemed to be frozen.

The escaping spies and?Monster King all looked terrified when they saw this lady.

“Temple Master... Black Spirit!”

“What is she doing here?”

“Why did Temple Master Black Spirit, the number one expert in the Human League, come here?”

The spies felt helpless and Monster King Ji looked pale.

They knew that if they were facing Temple Master Iceberg they might be able to make it out alive. But now, they had to face Temple Master Black Spirit.

Even the most powerful overlord among the monsters, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, might not be her?match.

“Monster spies.”

The lady stood there, towering above them in the air. After giving a cold glance to the spies, she waved her hand.

A blue wave immediately rolled out towards the spies and surrounded them. The spies struggled hard, but with a clench of the lady’s hands, a cracking sound was heard as their throats were instantly crushed. A moment later, they all fell to the ground, dead.

Jian Wushuang held his breath as he took in this scene.

This lady had killed a Monster King that was as powerful as a Human Temple Master, along with eight Rank Nine Monsters, with one casual strike.

“How powerful is she?”

“The number one expert in the Human League is truly powerful beyond belief.”

Temple Master Iceberg was filled with the same horror as Jian Wushuang. He hurried to Temple Master Black Spirit and greeted her respectfully. “Temple Master Black Spirit.”

Temple Master Iceberg knew very well that he was no match for this lady despite being ranked within the top three of the Monster-exterminating League.

It was her mighty power that frightened the Demonic Beasts on the Monster Continent. Therefore, she was the absolute leader of their league.

Temple Master Iceberg dared not go against her.

After putting away the spies’ bodies and Interspatial Rings, Temple Master Black Spirit looked toward Temple Master Iceberg and said, “Temple Master Iceberg, you acted so quickly! I hurried here as soon as I learned that some monster spies were attacking our Divine Emperor, but I still arrived here later than you.”

“I...” Temple Master Iceberg paused for a moment before he continued, “I happened to be in the area when I received the news.”

“I see.” Temple Master Black Spirit raised her eyebrows, but she did not question him further.

At that time, two flowing lights rushed toward them from the sky, and in no time, they had landed. They were none other than Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, Temple Master Iceberg.”

The newcomers looked surprised to see Temple Master Black Spirit there and greeted her respectfully.

“Where are the monster spies?” Temple Master Black Feather finally asked.

“I’ve killed them all. Sorry to have you hurry here in vain,” said Temple Master Black Spirit.

Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea were startled by those words.

As far as they knew, Temple Master Black Spirit rarely left the Holy Place to go outside, so they could not understand why she had come to kill these spies in person.
