Chapter 103: Bright Future

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Palace Masters were very surprised. Naturally, everyone in the square outside of the Dragon Gate was even more shocked.

“The Eleventh Level of the Dragon Gate.”

“Will he pass it?”

“Is that even possible?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Generally speaking, passing the Seventh Level of the Dragon Gate means his comprehension in the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is on a par with a master in the Initial Yin-Yang Void Realm. By comparison, passing the Eighth Level should make him equal to an average warrior in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. Therefore, passing the Ninth Level, like Bai Cheng, means he is much stronger than many masters in Yin-Yang Void Realm. Passing the Eleventh Level…”

“What a monster!”

“How old he is, it is said that he is seventeen years old now, right? A boy of 17 years old, passing the Eleventh Level of the Dragon Gate?”

It caused a great stir in the square.

Below the arena, everyone shouted in shock.

“Aha, the Eleventh Level, that’s definitely my Third Brother. How amazing would it be if he passed it.” Wang Yuan was the happiest one among the people present. He was so proud of his brother that his voice rang out in the square.

Though he had limited talent and could only pass the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate even now, he had a brother who was a genius…

“The Eleventh Level.” Su Rou’s beautiful eyes were also full of shock.

“That guy…” Su Lie stood at the edge of the square with a saber on his back. Looking at the sparkling golden light on the eleventh floor of the golden tower, he couldn’t help marveling at it, “Even for masters on the Earthly Dragon List, I’m afraid only the top ten could comprehend so deeply and pass the Eleventh Level.”

However, while standing in the crowd at this moment, Nangong Jie was staring at the golden tower with a look of horror.

“How is that possible?”

“Isn’t this impossible?”

Nangong Jie was muttering to himself.

“Aha, who said that if my brother passed the Ninth Level, he would change his first name with his last name?” Wang Yuan said sarcastically.

Hearing that, the people present looked at each other speechlessly.

Nangong Jie’s face was aflame with embarrassment. He could only hide his face in shame.

At a corner of the square, stood Bai Cheng, a white-haired man wearing white. He looked grave while staring at the golden tower.

” Sir Grayrobe, you told me to kill him whenever I got a chance. But how? ” Bai Cheng roared and snarled in his heart.

“He is at the Eleventh Level. I could only pass the Ninth Level by doing my utmost. He is much stronger than me in comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. It is impossible for me to kill him outside, let alone inside Dragon Palace.”

Bai Cheng understood his own strength clearly. Compared with Jian Wushuang, he was only stronger in Cultivation of Spiritual Power. After all, he was in Profound Gold Core Realm, while Jian Wushuang was still in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Even so, his power would be equal to someone in Initial Gold Core Realm if he fully brought out his potential.

Together with his high comprehension in Sword Essence, Jian Wushuang could face him without fear.

Bang!

The giant door of the golden tower opened, and Jian Wushuang walked out slowly, with his Long Sword on his back.

He passed the Eleventh Level. But in the Twelfth, the opponent was much stronger than the woman in black in the Eleventh, much stronger than him, too. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was quickly defeated.

In front of the Dragon Gate.

As soon as Jian Wushuang showed up and looked around, the whole square suddenly turned quiet.

Holding their breath, all people present stared at Jian Wushuang, the person who had just defied what was considered to be common sense.

Suddenly, there was a deafening shout.

“Aha, Third Brother.”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou ran towards him immediately.

“Awesome. Amazing.”

Wang Yuan patted Jian Wushuang on his shoulder. He smiled and said, “The Eleventh Level, I did not think that you would pass from the Fifth Level to the Eleventh Level of the Dragon Gate without a break, right after returning. You really never cease to amaze us.”

“Go, let’s go get a drink. We must drink to celebrate.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang didn’t say no. Then, he walked directly towards his manor under everyone’s gaze.

Though Jian Wushuang had left, people in the square still talked about him. Many disciples of Dragon Palace were even still in shock.

Above the nearby void.

“Aha, Palace Master White, you misjudged him this time,” said another Palace Master while laughing.

“Don’t laugh at me. If you found out that he had great talent in comprehending the Sword Essences of Gale and Earth, but didn’t focus on them. Instead, trying to comprehend another one– Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Wouldn’t you be worried? You would act the same as me.” Palace Master White raised her eyebrows and smiled.

She had been disappointed in Jian Wushuang because of that. However, what he had done today raised her expectations towards him, more than ever before.

And she was happy about it.

“He surprised me,” Palace Master White couldn’t help saying.

“Not only did he comprehend three kinds of sword essence at one time, but he made great progress in all of them. It’s amazing.” Temple Master Yao nodded and highly praised him, “We looked down upon him.”

“That’s true!”

“We did look down upon him. No one expected that he was such a genius, nor that he could defy what we normally accept as common sense!

“We have seen lots of geniuses. But exceptional geniuses like him are so rare that, even in Dragon Palace, there is only one every few decades.”

“He dares to comprehend three kinds of sword essence at one time. Not following the suggestion of Palace Master White. He doesn’t care about whether people in Dragon Palace look down on him. In the very next moment, he proved that he chose the right path by going through the Dragon Gate. Though he is arrogant, I like him.”

“We thought he was wasting his talent, but now… It is really ironic.”

“Comprehending three kinds of sword essence at one time is impossible for many with normal talent. However, for those geniuses, the truly exceptional geniuses, even comprehending four kinds of sword essence at one time is possible, let alone three,” Palace Master Black said suddenly.

Everyone present looked over at Palace Master Black.

“Does no one remember Crazy Saber from a hundred years ago?” Palace Master Black looked around and asked.

“Crazy Saber?” Each Palace Master’s heart missed a beat. It was obvious that they all knew of him.

“He was able to comprehend three kinds of saber essence at one time. Not only that, he achieved great success in all three, even combining them with high combat effectiveness. He was called the strongest in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, and he kept the leading position on the Heavenly Dragon List for decades. Isn’t that terrifying?” Palace Master Black said.

Hearing that, all of the Palace Masters present were respectful.

They all knew how formidable Crazy Saber was.

Palace Master Black continued.

“Swordsman’s strength may be not a quarter of Crazy Saber’s, but he has as much talent as Crazy Saber!”

“In a word, he… has a bright future!”
