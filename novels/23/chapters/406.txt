“Feng Zhu, why are you here?” Sir Axe asked in an icy tone.

“Why? I’m here to help you of course.” Feng Zhu sneered.

“Hum, I don’t need your help. You’d better leave immediately.” Sir Axe snorted.

“Heh heh. It’s not up to you.” Feng Zhu laughed. He gestured to his squad. “Take action!”

Feng Zhu and his people rushed toward the squad of Marquis Cangyue.

“Damn it!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang and his teammates were annoyed by the turn of events.

Feng Zhu claimed that he had come to help, but his real intention was to get the battle achievements that would be up for grabs once the Marquis Cangyue squad was vanquished.

“You want to grab our battle achievements?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. His aggression and fury were palpable.

His killing intent materialized as an immense blood-colored river.

It was Road to the Underworld!

Blood River tumbled and covered the whole area.

“Gosh!”

The strength of the Marquis Cangyue experts had already been weakened by Sword Realm. The deterioration in their strength was now exacerbated by Blood River and they were unable to stabilize their stances.

Their strength was suppressed to a new low.

The Blood River surged toward Feng Zhu and his people, causing their speed to decrease.

“What’s this?”

Feng Zhu and his people looked at the Blood River in shock.

“Hurry up. Go kill the experts of Marquis Cangyue.” Jian Wushuang shouted.

“OK.” Lei Dao and the other commanders started to strike with their best moves.

As the Marquis Cangyue experts were greatly weakened, they were unable to withstand the attacks. All of them perished, including their leader, who was killed by Sir Axe.

Calm was restored to the area.

Feng Zhu and his people looked grave as they fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“This man has a powerful skill!”

“That Realm he displayed was so powerful?”

“The Blood River slowed the Marquis Cangyue squad so much that they were unable to escape! The Realm is too terrifying!”

It was terrifying indeed!

Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique would make it possible for one squad to defeat an equally skilled squad.

The Realm Technique could also restrict speed of opponents so that they could not run away.

Any squad that had such an odd and terrifying technique at their disposal would be a force to reckon with.

Feng Zhu was envious of Sir Axe.

“Feng Zhu, sorry, it looks like you will get nothing from this trip.” Sir Axe sneered as he looked at Feng Zhu.

Feng Zhu and his squad had been affected by Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique. They had not been able to attack the Marquis Cangyue experts and therefore could not share the battle achievements.

“Hum, you’re lucky to have such brilliant expert.” Feng Zhu considered Jian Wushuang

Sir Axe could not help but laugh as he looked at Jian Wushuang with the same appraising look.

He recalled Jian Wushuang’s words. “I have a strong body and won’t be easily killed. I’ve also mastered one Realm Technique.”

Jian Wushuang’s tone had been casual.

Lei Dao had commented that Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique was formidable and would be of great help to the squad. At that time, Sir Axe had not taken him seriously.

Sir Axe now knew that he had a valuable asset.

Jian Wushuang’s technique was something that every squad desired.

Jian Wushuang had fully exerted the effect of the Realm Technique.

“Boy, what’s your name?” Feng Zhu looked at Jian Wushuang and asked.

“Swordsman,” replied Jian Wushuang indifferently.

“Swordsman?” Feng Zhu frowned. “Your Realm Technique is very useful.?Would you be interested to join my squad? If you agree, you’ll get 30 percent of all the battle achievements we earn. What do you think?”

“Feng Zhu...” Sir Axe voiced his objections.

Lei Dao and his teammates looked at Jian Wushuang.

Feng Zhu had given Jian Wushuang very attractive terms.

However, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and shook his head. “Sorry, I’m not interested.”

“Oh?” Feng Zhu frowned. “In that case, let me know if you change your mind.”

Feng Zhu then left with his people.

“Gentlemen, thanks a lot. See you!”

The experts who had been attacked by the Marquis Cangyue squad clasped their hands with Jian Wushuang and his teammates. Then they left.

All the battle achievements belonged to Jian Wushuang and his teammates.

Sir Axe began to distribute the battle achievements to his squad.

Allocation was easy. They had killed eight opponents and received eight ID tokens which represented 800 battle achievements, so each of them would get 100 battle achievements.

But if the treasures were distributed equally, it would be unfair to Jian Wushuang who had contributed the most. Therefore, Sir Axe decided to give Jian Wushuang more treasures.

The eight dead experts had held numerous treasures in their Interspatial Rings. Jian Wushuang received 30 percent of the treasures.

No one disagreed with it.

It was an unspoken agreement that whoever contributed the most in Flaming Battlefield would get the most treasures.
