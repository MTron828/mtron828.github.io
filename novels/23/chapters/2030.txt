2031 Take Action!

Jian Wushuang didn’t move even after he saw the five Great Emperors exit the Imperial Cabinet to go to Doctrine Propagation Palace.

After a short while.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

There were suddenly ancient yet loud bells ringing from the void afar and they reverberated through the entire Imperial Peak.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed when he heard the bell.

“Doctrine Propagation Ceremony has begun,” Jian Wushuang broke into a bloodthirsty smirk.

“Let’s not delay any further. Let’s take action,” Abysmal Saint Master said in Blood Mountain Sword.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily and finally moved.

He didn’t leave to the golden whirlpool immediately but he first came to the border of Imperial Peak where the great formation was.

Jian Wushuang waved and Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s figure appeared in front of him out of nowhere.

“Great Emperor Zhi Luo, we shall hand this to you. The Great Emperors in Imperial Peak had already gathered at Doctrine Propagation Palace and you already cultivated the concealing skills from Great Emperor Colored Glaze, there shouldn’t be anyone who could notice you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t worry about me. The three of you have to take the time to destroy Emperor Supreme Rock or the golden whirlpool,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said solemnly.

“No problem.”

Jian Wushuang agreed rather straightforwardly. Then, he plunged in the direction of the golden whirlpool.

Then, in Eternal Chaotic World far away, in the palace around the void near the dark millstone.

The Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance gathered.

They already knew that Jian Wushuang and his expert troop were taking action that day.

“I hope that Abysmal Saint Master, Sword Emperor and their troop would succeed!”

“We can’t hope. They have to succeed. If they fail, it will be difficult to find another opportunity to take action again. Plus, the dark millstone might be unstoppable forever.”

“Yes, they have to succeed this time, regardless of the price they have to pay.”

The Great Emperors clenched their fists tightly and they looked extremely solemn.

As for Emperor Bai, he sat there in silence but they could see that he had hope in his eyes.

Eternal Chaotic World was already on the verge of life and death. If Jian Wushuang and his troop could destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock or the golden whirlpool to stop the dark millstone, Eternal Chaotic World would stand a chance to step back from leaping off the cliff.

“Go for it,” Emperor Bai sighed.

…

In Imperial Peak in Three-Emperors World.

In the void above the huge golden whirlpool, there was a hidden lofty palace.

In the palace, there were three people gathered together.

The three people were two men and one woman, in which a man and a woman were playing chess together while a redheaded elder watched in silence. No one spoke.

Until the brawny man that Jian Wushuang had taken the form of appeared before the golden whirlpool, the redheaded elder raised his eyebrows and said, “Hasn’t the Doctrine Propagation Ceremony begun? The guys on Imperial Peak should be there. Why is there still someone here?”

The man and the woman who were playing chess heard and simply glanced at him. Then, the middle-aged man in black smiled and said, “Who knows. That guy might not be interested in Doctrine Propagation Ceremony.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The redheaded elder raised his eyebrows but didn’t think further.

He was just a guy in early stage Chaotic Realm. They didn’t care much about him.

Just then…

“Ridiculous!”

The redheaded elder suddenly roared and his voice reverberated through the surrounding palace.

The redheaded elder’s figure quivered and he left to go to the golden whirlpool under the palace. Although the man and the woman who was playing chess creased their eyebrows, they didn’t move.

In front of the golden whirlpool, Jian Wushuang had originally been stood there but he had suddenly turned into flowing light to plunge into the golden whirlpool to reach for the Emperor Supreme Rock.

His speed was extremely fast and he had already arrived in the golden whirlpool. Before he got closer to Emperor Supreme Rock, the redheaded elder appeared before him.

“You have guts! Don’t you know the rules in Imperial Peak?” The redheaded elder looked cold as he bellowed.

Imperial Peak had a strict rule.

One of the rules indicated that no one was allowed to step foot into the golden whirlpool. For whoever violated the rule, the punishment could be a death sentence.

Then, Jian?Wushuang barged into the golden whirlpool.

Jian Wushuang heard the redheaded elder’s confrontation and he looked confused, “Rules? What rules? Why have I not heard about it before?”

“You are really a daredevil!” The redheaded elder roared and there was an enormous divine might that pressed on Jian Wushuang. If it had been any other ordinary cultivator in early stage Chaotic Realm, he would have been shivering in fear.

However, Jian Wushuang looked calm and composed. He didn’t look uncomfortable at all.

“Hehe, I shall skip the bullshit,” Jian Wushuang broke into a smile and moved. He charged at the redheaded elder like a bullet.

“You are courting death!” The redheaded elder was pissed off.

How dare a cultivator in early stage Chaotic Realm fight against him?!

However, just as the redheaded elder intended to kill the brawny man, who was arrogant and ruthless, he realized that Jian Wushuang had waved and…

When he waved, there were two bursts of fierce aura that soared up.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two figures appeared before the redheaded elder. They were Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao who were in Blood Mountain Sword.

The moment the two of them appeared, their Great Emperor aura instantly spread, especially Abysmal Saint Master’s aura. The boundless darkness shook the redheaded elder and he was terrified.

“This is...?” The redheaded elder’s face grew grave.

At the same time, in the hidden lofty palace above the golden whirlpool, the man and the woman who were playing chess immediately lifted their heads.

“Sh*t!”

Both of them saw each other’s change in expression. They didn’t care about their chess anymore and instantly turned into flowing lights to plunge to the golden whirlpool.

In the golden whirlpool, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao had already taken action.

Abysmal Saint Master was engulfed in boundless darkness. The boundless darkness even covered the golden lustre that was given out by Emperor Supreme Rock. He was the ruler of the darkness. As he waved his sleeve, the boundless power of darkness instantly substantiated into a black spear.

The black spear carried boundless extermination aura. The moment it took form, it shook the redheaded elder.

As for Emperor Jiu Qiao, although his attack was not as terrifying as Abysmal Saint Master’s, he was ready to give his all in the battle. It was obvious that he was going to kill the redheaded elder with thunderous measures.

Of course, Jian Wushuang took action too.

Then, he held back his power no more. He instantly let his boundless divine power spread. He didn’t use his punching skill anymore but he drew Blood Mountain Sword.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo… Blast Rainstorm!!
