Chapter 796: Honing Skills On the Way

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After his visit to the Universal Thunder Sect, Jian Wushuang had nothing else to attend to in the Firmament Territory. Thus, he took off on the same day.

Several days later, in the sky over a vast wasteland outside the Firmament Territory.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Ten bandits besieged a black-robed youth carrying a longsword. A brown-haired man who seemed to be their leader snarled, “Brat, you just got out of the Firmament Territory, right? A Divine Realm expert dares travel out of the Firmament Territory. How stupid you are!”

“Haha…” The other bandits burst out laughing.

“Given that you’re a dumbass, as long as you hand over your Interspatial Ring and all the treasures you’re carrying, we will spare your life. Otherwise…you’ll die!” The brown-haired man bellowed. There was a chilly look in his eyes.

Surrounded by the bandits, Jian Wushuang looked around with the trace of a smile on his lips.

“I heard that there were many bandits robbing travelers in the Grey Zone. It would be highly risky to travel across the Grey Zone without Eternal Realm strength. I’ve finally learnt today that it’s true.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the bandits around him and discovered that most of them were Divine Realm experts, whereas that brown-haired man was a real Eternal Realm expert.

The Eternal World must be more brutal than the Ancient World.

In places within territories like the Firmament Territory, there were assorted sects in control. Therefore,?there was still some semblance of order.

In the Eternal World, many places were not within any territories. These included the common boundaries or intervals between territories and could span a considerably large area.

Those places were called the Grey Zone.

The Grey Zone was quite a mess. Nobody had bothered to restore order, so bandits were rampant and experts passing by usually became their targets.

Therefore, rumors abound in the Firmament Territory that traveling in a Grey Zone without reaching the Eternal Realm was courting death.

The bandits never picked their victims randomly. They had no fear of Divine Realm experts. Any of the bandits could easily rob a Divine Realm expert. But if the traveler had reached the Eternal Realm…

The Eternal Realm consisted of Six Steps, and it was extremely difficult to cross the gap between each of the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm.

To judge which Step an expert was at, it would depend on his Sword Heart, Saber Heart, etc. But the true power of the Sword Heart or Saber Heart would not be apparent if the expert did not display his real skills.

Hence, even if an Eternal Realm expert stood before you, you would never know his strength unless he struck.

It was possible that the person was an Eternal Realm expert who had not even crossed the threshold of Step One. But he could also be an expert at the peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm.

Due to the difficulty in identifying the level of an Eternal Realm expert, bandits would usually not have a go at them.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was merely a Divine Realm expert, the bandits targeted him.

“I just left the Firmament Territory and am on my way to the Tang of the East. That is a really distant kingdom. I probably have to spend years to get there. It’ll be too boring if I travel on my own for such a long period. But if there are bandits to entertain me, that’ll be fantastic.”

“And you bandits seem pretty powerful. One of you has even reached the Eternal Realm. It’s a good chance for me to hone my swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

In the next moment, he leaped forward with incredible speed. As he did so, a streak of invincible Sword Essence also burst out.

“You want to put up a fight?” The brown-haired man was furious. He barked, “Guys, kill him!”

The two sides immediately crossed swords.

Jian Wushuang demonstrated his swordsmanship at once.

He did not unleash his full strength. On the contrary, he deliberately stifled his power and maintained it at the basic level of a superior Divine Realm expert. He started to fight solely with his swordsmanship.

Nevertheless, his brilliant swordsmanship enabled him to dispatch the ordinary Divine Realm experts easily.

As for the brown-haired man, he was an Eternal Realm expert but had not even crossed the threshold of Step One.

Even though Jian Wushuang had repressed his power, he was still able to destroy him with his swordsmanship.

In just a few minutes, the bandits who had besieged Jian Wushuang were all dead, including the brown-haired man. None of them had managed to escape.

“Go ahead!”

Jian Wushuang set off and continued to head in the direction of the Tang of the East with the help of the Star Map.

He traveled along the borders of territories. Very often, he would run into bandits in the Grey Zone and fight them.

By fighting those bandits, Jian Wushuang was improving himself and his swordsmanship.

Every time he fought, he would deliberately constrain his power and leave his Sword Heart inactivated. He merely relied on swordsmanship to fight his opponents. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He only went all out when he encountered really powerful experts.

But none of the bandits in the Grey Zone were of that caliber. So far, the strongest one Jian Wushuang met was merely at Step Four of the Eternal Realm. As for the experts who were at or above Step Five of the Eternal Realm…

They had no need to be bandits. In any territory, they would be big shots.

Therefore, with Jian Wushuang’s strength, traveling in the Grey Zone was not that dangerous.

Time passed as Jian Wushuang traveled and upgraded his power in numerous battles.

“Splash—”

A vast and boundless sea surged with great momentum.

The seawater was as blue as the sky, with waves moving across its surface.

A large island floated in the center of this boundless sea.

Although it was called an island, its land area was huge. Its diameter was hundreds of miles.

It was the Cercis Island!

It was the place that Jian Wushuang would pass on his way to the Tang of the East.

The Cercis Island was also the place where Sect Master Lei Xin of Universal Thunder Sect and Su Ming were staying.

Clothed in black robes with a long sword strapped to his back, Jian Wushuang watched the huge island from the Void over the endless sea with his arms crossed.

“It’s been 37 years. Have I finally arrived at the Cercis Island?” Jian Wushuang smirked.

The Cercis Island was more than millions of miles away from the Firmament Territory.

Between the two, there were over a hundred territories. Normally, if a man wanted to travel to this place from the Firmament Territory, it would certainly take him at least a hundred years, perhaps longer if there were delays from encounters with bandits.

Jian Wushuang had managed this in merely 37 years. When he had entered a territory that was a branch of the Void Temple, he had spent 10 million Divine Gems to use the space wormhole, which sent him directly to a spot very close to the Cercis Island.
