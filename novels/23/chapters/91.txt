Chapter 92: The Mutation of Sword Soul

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It seems that I am being watched?

With a cryptic smile, Jian Wushuang said nothing to the people in front, moving into the jungle quickly and vanishing from their view.

After Jian Wushuang left, someone in the team started to talk.

“What a surprise, I initially thought that he was that guy. Unexpectedly, he’s a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea.”

“A Warrior with just a level of Spiritual Sea dares to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. He must be really bold.”

“I think he isn’t bold, just suicidal.”

These two men were walking abreast and talking.

Suddenly… a silvery Ghost-like figure appeared in front of one man while a sword light stabbed at him. The man could react. After the sword light slashed across his throat, he was immediately killed. Just as quickly, the silvery Ghost-liked figure disappeared.

“Hey, do you think that the horrible guy has left…” The other man was still talking to that man and looking towards him.

He saw the corpse of that man slowly falling to the ground.

“Oh!” The strong man screamed and all the other members of the team came over for a look.

“What happened?” They asked.

“This…”

“Asshole. It’s him again!”

“He’s coming. The bad guy. He’s coming again!”

“Devil. Devil. He’s a devil!”

Suddenly the whole team became restless and terrified again.

It should be known that this team originally had over 30 people. But now there was just a half alive, the other half of them were killed by this “devil”.

From start to end, they had not even seen the devil’s face clearly.

Whoosh!

The sound of rushing wind was heard again. A silvery figure like a Ghost moved swiftly and showed up in front of the strong man. The strong man saw a sword light with difficulty and then was killed directly.

The silvery figure moved toward the jungle again.

“It’s so easy… to kill these people.” The Dark Silver Guard laughed. Shortly after he had just entered the jungle, he found a black-robed youth standing here.

With his hand clasping his wrists behind his back, the black-robed youth watched him with interest. It seemed that the black-robed young man had been waiting for him.

“Who and what are you doing here?” The Dark Silver Guard felt surprised, but the black-robed youth in front of him had already started to attack him.

The Dark Silver Guard was outclassed by a formidable sword shadow filled with strong Earth Sword Essence.

The Dark Silver Guard changed his countenance at once and hastily brandished his Purple Soft Sword to parry.

Bang!

The sword shadow hit the Purple Soft Sword and twisted it due to the powerful force. The Dark Silver Guard felt his palm numb and a stinging pain. He flew out of the jungle and staggered back a few steps before standing firmly.

Shua!

All of the people in the team with more than 10 members looked at him together.

“Damn it!” The Dark Silver Guard said and had a ghastly expression.

“The seventh.” The other silvery figure showed up at the side of the Dark Silver Guard, staring with alertness at the black-robed youth who was walking towards them slowly.

“Oh? There are two guys?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and felt delighted secretly.

Jiang WuShuang followed the team before. Perceiving the countenance of the people in the team, Jiang Wushuang guessed that they might be under surveillance of the Dark Silver Guard. So he didn’t leave and hid in the jungle. As he expected, the Dark Silver Guard appeared.

But lucky for him, the team was waylaid by two instead of only one Dark Silver Guard.

Two for one?

“Who are you?” The man with Birdeyes, the leader of the team, shouted to them immediately when he saw Jian Wushuang and two Dark Silver Guards. All the other members took a deep breath and waited to see what would happen next.

“It’s not a matter of who I am. You need to know that they’re targeting to your team. And I am targeting them,” Jian Wushuang laughed and said.

“Those two guys staring at us?” The man with Birdeyes looked at the two Dark Silver Guards and said.

“The devils? Are them?”

“Two warriors, who are in the Profound Gold Core Realm?”

Immediately, the whole team became restless.

With a solemn expression, the two Dark Silver Guards did not care about the man with birdeyes and his team, but they were afraid of Jian Wushuang standing in front of them.

Although Jian Wushuang’s Cultivation of Spiritual Power was just at the Level of Spiritual Sea, no one dared to regard him as a common Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior in terms of that movements he showed just now.

“Old seventh. We are exposed. It’s not our strength to slaughter directly. We should leave now. Hurry up!” The Dark Silver Guard, who had never fought with Jian Wushuang, said.

“Okay.” The other Dark Silver Guard nodded heavily. Both of them transformed into beams of Flowing Light and fled into the jungle at the side.

“Haha. Do you think you can escape?”

A cold voice emerged and then Jian Wushuang stabbed at the two Dark Silver Guards with his Triple-kill Sword.

The sword shadow moved so quickly and was like a flash of lightning streaking through the Void.

A gust of wind roared.

The wind stopped and the swords fell to the ground at the same time.

Everything returned to peace.

The two Dark Silver Guards’ eyes widened in shock. They looked incredulously at their chests which had been poked through.

The two dead bodies dropped to the ground at the same time.

Jian Wushuang held the Triple-kill Sword with blood dripping from the Sword Edge.

“I have already mastered the fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang’s lips curled into a small smile.

The fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship was faster and more ruthless than the fourth move– A Hundred Variations.

The sword was brandished. The wind stopped and then the sword dropped! The two Dark Silver Guards were already dead.

“They are also warriors in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm, but are far from the Disciples of Dragon Palace.” Jian Wushuang looked down at the two corpses, shaking his head secretly.

The Disciples of Dragon Palace, were the talents who comprehended the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth to a high level. At the Dragon Palace, a Disciple of Dragon Palace in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm was able to compete with the warriors in the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

However, Jian Wushuang had beaten a Disciple of Dragon Palace who was in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm. It was really easy for him to kill Warriors at the Level of Gold Core. Moreover, the Formless Swordsmanship he mastered was the ultimate Sword Skill which stressed speed.

As long as Jian Wushuang used the fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship, the two Dark Silver Guards had no chance to struggle and would be killed immediately.

After killing the two Dark Silver Guards and picking up their Purple Soft Swords and Rings of Heaven and Earth, Jian Wushuang was far too busy to care about the shocked expressions of those people around him. He turned around and wanted to leave. After he had walked several steps, he stopped suddenly.

“What?” Jian Wushuang said. With unprecedented shock in his eyes, he looked out into the distance.

He still could see the vibrant jungle. But at this moment, there was a kind of strange feeling emerging in his heart.

Meanwhile, a mysterious strength from the Sword Soul within his body gradually emerged.

The Sword Soul… his Sword Soul was waking up.

Although his Sword Soul was awakening, he didn’t know what it was. He just knew that because of the awakening of Sword Soul, he could comprehend sword essence with an astounding speed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But now, it was his first mutation after the awakening of Sword Soul.
