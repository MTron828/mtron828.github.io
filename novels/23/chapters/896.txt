“Essence Blood! of Inheritance!”

Staring at the drop of dark golden Essence Blood floating above the palace, his eyes shone brightly.

He had the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan. For him, this drop of Essence Blood of Inheritance from the Eight-star Imperial God was akin to a great fortune. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Witch King, I’m curious as to how can I refine this drop of Essence Blood.” Jian Wushuang asked.

“All you need to do is to go up there and start to refine. But in the process you’ll be met by an obstacle hindrance. As to what that obstacle may be, you’ll find out when the time comes.” Witch King’s voice rang in the scarlet palace. “Remember, you only have one chance to refine it. If you fail, don’t try again but just leave.”

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then he flew directly towards the drop of dark gold Essence Blood.

Soon Jian Wushuang approached that drop of dark gold Essence Blood.

Jian Wushuang fixed his eyes on the drop of Essence Blood fervently, burning with excitement. Then, he reached out a large hand and tried to grab thedrop of Essence Blood. But the moment he touched it, he triggered an invisible attack.

Jian Wushuang shuddered.

“This is...a consciousness attack?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

He himself was good at launching consciousness attacks. Therefore, he was quite familiar with such attacks.

“Is this the obstacle I must overcome during the refining?” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately focused on refining the drop of Essence Blood.

As he was refining it, the consciousness attack that came from the drop of Essence Blood was becoming more aggressive.

After around half an hour, Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly sparkled. He opened his mouth, and the drop of dark gold Essence Blood instantly shrank and fluttered inside his body.

“I made it!” Jian Wushuang was thrilled.

“How is this possible?”

An old but vigorous voice rang out throughout the whole scarlet. Witch King’s voice obviously revealed a note of incredulity. “The consciousness attack in master’s Essence Blood is incredibly powerful. How could this kid fight off this consciousness attack without any effort?”

“This is impossible!”

The Witch King found it quite astonishing that Jian Wushuang refined the Essence Blood left by his master so easily.

It was indeed easy for Jian Wushuang. During the process of refining, Jian Wushuang did not meet much resistance at all. And he succeeded in just half an hour.

As confusing as this may have been, the fact remained that Jian Wushuang had refined the drop of Essence Blood smoothly.

“Humph!”

As a snort sounded, the whole scarlet palace began to tremble. Then, the Witch King disgorged the huge scarlet palace from his stomach. Jian Wushuang, who was staying inside the scarlet palace, was spat out.

Still in the Stellar Fog Sea.

Looking indifferent, Lord Spirit Sound was standing in the Void. Meanwhile, the unbelievably colossal body of the Witch King was floating ahead of him, and Jian Wushuang was walking out of the scarlet palace.

Just when he stepped out, the Witch King’s gold colored eyes as bright as the sun suddenly swiveled in his direction.

“Blood Mountain, tell me, have you learned any Secret Skill that can enhance your own consciousness?” The Witch King asked in a low voice.

“Secret Skills that can enhance one’s own consciousness?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and shook his head softly.

He had previously practiced some Secret Skills about consciousness attacks. But as for those that could strengthen one’s own consciousness, he had not even of heard any, let alone practice it.

“No way! This is utterly impossible!”

The Witch King let out thunderousbellows. “Master’s Essence Blood contains a form of consciousness attack. Its impact varies with each individual. The higher one’s phase is, the stronger the attack will be. But anyway, you’re an Inverse Cultivator at the level of the Divine Realm expert, which equals to a normal Eternal Realm expert. Thus, the impact of this consciousness attack on you must also be quite hard to bear. Even a real Dao Master might not be able to fend it off.”

“But you, you not only fended it off but managed to do so with little effort, it was as though the consciousness attack didn’t influence you at all.”

“Since you did that, your consciousness shall be unusually strong, or even more powerful than most of the Dao Masters.”

“You’re merely a Divine Realm expert. If you never practiced that kind of Secret Skills, how has your consciousness become so strong?”

“You must have learned some Secret Skills before. Think harder.”

The Witch King’s voice was very tense.

The Witch King had seen the world when he followed his master, an Eight-star Imperial God, on expeditions in a variety of places.

Based on his experience, he was sure that Jian Wushuang must have practiced some form of unique Secret Skill that reinforced his own consciousness.

Otherwise, Jian Wushuang would not have been able to refine the Essence Blood left by his master so easily.

When Jian Wushuang heard the words of the Witch King, he could not resist scowling.

Some Secret Skill that can enhance one’s own consciousness?

It was true that he never practiced any.

But the Witch King was so certain about this. Could it be...

A possible explanation dawned on Jian Wushuang.

“The Universal Dao Scripture!” Jian Wushuang yelled, abruptly clapping his hands.

When Jian Wushuang joined his master Xuan Yi and became his personal disciple, Palace Master Xuan Yi personally handed him the Universal Dao Scripture.

At that time, Xuan Yi did not describe what specific use this Universal Dao Scripture had. He only told him that the Univeral Dao Scripture was highly unique and could be quite helpful in the future.

Jian Wushuang was also bemused about this scripture.

When he was in the Ancient God Clan and treated like a clansman of the Ancient God Clan, he had suspected that the Universal Dao Scripture had changed the aura of his soul.

But during the meeting with Xuan Yi later, this speculation was denied.

However, now...

“Could it be that what the Universal Dao Scripture has changed is not the aura of my soul but my consciousness?” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

Of course, this was just a guess. He could not be certain.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and said, “Witch King, my senior, I did learn a very special Secret Skill. But I have no idea what effect that Secret Skill has. All I know is that it is a very unusual Secret Skill.”

“Well, that must be it.” The Witch King nodded with assurance. “You, as a Divine Realm expert, have not lived in this world for very long time, right? Even if you’ve been through a great amount of training and survived great hardships, your consciousness would not be that strong. So, you surely have practiced some Secret Skill to enhance your consciousness.”

“And this kind of Secret Skills that help one improve his consciousness is rather rare throughout the world. So the one you practice is naturally out of the ordinary!”

“Is it?” Jian Wushuang nodded. To verify this, he would have to send a message to his Master after he got out of the Stellar Fog Sea.

“Well, no matter what, you’ve refined the Essence Blood of my master. From now on, you are the successor of my master.” The Witch King announced in a booming voice, as though these words were beyond question. Then, he cast his eyes on Jian Wushuang once again.

“Blood Mountain, give one drop of your Ancient God Essence Blood.” The Witch King requested.

“My Ancient God Essence Blood?” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Each Ancient God had his own Essence Blood, and so did Jian Wushuang. Although he did not know what the Witch King would do with his Essence Blood, he extracted a single drop and handed it over to the Witch King without hesitation.
