Chapter 214: Elevate Strength Again?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Shameless!”

Indeed shameless.

The experts from the 12 dynasties and the old sects were all glaring at Mo Lingtian.

“Those idiots...”?Mo Lingtian didn’t care those gazes and sneered in mind.?“In the presence of huge interests, I prefer to be brazen. That’s a little cost as long as I could connect our sect with Holy Emperor Palace.”

Jian Wushuang also looked at the abruptly emerging Mo Lingtian.

“Wilderness Sword Sect? ” A solemn look appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

Before the Point Grab Battle in the Sky Valley, he heard that although there were lots of experts from the old sects, the most flamboyant sect was the Wilderness Sword Sect and it was one of the top Sects.

The sect was one the most suitable sects for Jian Wushuang due to it focused on the Sword Principle. Therefore, Jian Wushuang originally was full of expectation for the Wilderness Sword Sect.

But now... Jian Wushuang rejoiced at not joining the Wilderness Sword Sect.

“Are you Mo Lingtian from the Wilderness Sword Sect?” Jian Wushuang looked at Mo Lingtian.

“Yes,” Mo Lingtian nodded and said, “little guy, you should call me Master Ling Tian. So unmannered, is that what your parents teach you?”

“Heh, my parents didn’t teach me how to be a shameless man like you.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. “I originally wanted to join the Wilderness Sword Sect. But now I will pass. The Wilderness Sword Sect seems to cultivate shameless experts.”

“Ridiculous! Compared with numerous geniuses in our Wilderness Sword Sect, you are nothing.” Mo Lingtian sneered.

“Mr. Ling Tian, it’s not imperative to tell him so much. Kill him right now,” the gray-robed man shouted.

“Take it easy. He will die beyond any doubts.” Mo Lingtian was confident.

After all, his confidence was based on the fact that he was a real expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

Compared with Grayrobe who was merely at the Initial Yang Void Realm, Mo Lingtian was three levels stronger.

Mo Lingtian began to have a gait, and his aura was emanated. The aura was stronger than before when he took another step.

The terrific aura overwhelmed Jian Wushuang and made him harder to breathe.

“Peak of the Yang Void Realm.” Jian Wushuang’s face fell. Then he raised his head and roared. “Mo Lingtian!”

Mo Lingtian looked up at Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were imbued with terrific killing intent. “You have chosen who to side with and your decision is set in stone in my eyes.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Today, it may impossible for me to hurt you. But there will be a day when you will be laying down on the ground motionless!”

“Ha, in the future? I think you should focus on surviving right now.” Mo Lingtian was laughing and didn’t care what Jian Wushuang said. Mo Lingtian’s figure burst out.

During the burst, the terrific aura was condensed to an extreme amount and the surrounding air was solidified completely because of it.

When Jian Wushuang saw Mo Lintian dashing towards him, he shrank his eyes and turned around to run away.

“Escape?” Mo Lingtian smiled coldly and continued chasing Jian Wushuang.

As an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, his speed was faster than Jian Wushuang’s. It would not take him much time to catch up with Jian Wushuang.

However, he did not know that Jian Wushuang chose to run in the opposite direction not because he wanted to escape but because he was executing a secret kill.

“A secret skill, that takes one’s soul.”

A glimpse of madness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and the Soul-taking Secret Skill was executed.

Executing the Soul-taking Secret Skill needed some time, therefore, he had no choice but to get some distance. In the process of escaping, he executed the secret skill.

With executing the Soul-taking Secret Skill, a horrible engulfing power burst out from Jian Wushuang immediately and began to engulf the surrounding area, taking anything that was alive.

Jian Wushuang escaped inside the jungle in the Sky Valley. The effect that the skill had on the environment was horrifying.

The surrounding trees, which he passed by, began to dry up instantly and then become deadwood.

The below ground also turned yellow and became dried as if a drought has been in place for decades.

Abundant living Qi flowed into Jian Wushuang’s body and it made Jian Wushuang’s aura surge up immediately.

Initially, his aura was at the level of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. But in a short time span, the aura was at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm. Subsequently, it was still surging up to break through the Gold Core Realm and reach the Initial Yin Void Realm.

After reaching the Initial Yin Void Realm, the surging aura had ceased.

“Just the Initial Yin Void Realm ?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, but now he merely reached the Initial Yin Void Realm after executing the Soul-taking Secret Skill. He was not gratified with the improvement of only one level.

“Only the first volume of the Soul-taking Secret Skill is less useful than before for me,” Jian Wushuang said secretly.

The Soul-taking Secret Skill was divided into three volumes.

He only had the first volume.

The first volume was useful for him previously because his battle strength could be improved several levels after executing it. However, with the improvement of his Realm, it was apparent that merely having the first volume was limiting him.

“Despite only going up by one level it’s better than nothing.”

The killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Detecting the sound of wind behind him, he knew that Mo Lingtian had caught up to him.

Without hesitance, Jian Wushuang turned around and his Triple-kill Sword was trembling in his hand. With a lugubrious echo of the sword, the Long Sword burst out directly.

Selfless Sword Technique, Sky Isolating Form!

A combination of four sword essences!

Sword Way Source!

The Cultivation of Spiritual Power was comparable to the Initial Yin Void Realm after executing the Heavenly Creation Skill, plus the 100-fold strength because of the surging Supreme Gold Core Realm.

Complete activation.

Boom!

A streak of shining golden flowing light appeared in this world.

The golden flowing light caught everyone’s eyes instantly.

The golden flowing light was brutal, overbearing, and irresistible.

“Go to hell!”

At that moment, Mo Lingtian waved a Long Sword and chopped casually.

Although the swordsmanship was normal, the Cultivation of Spiritual Power at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm burst out.

Thud!

A huge roar resounded through the sky.

When the two horrible attacks interacted, the void formed a blast wave, which even naked eyes could see, creating ripples throughout the exchange of attacks.

Huahua... Many surrounding trees were immediately cracked from their trunks and in a short time, more than 100 trees had collapsed.

After the confrontation, Jian Wushuang moved back, but so did Mo Lingtian retreated three steps.

“What?” After standing firm, Mo Lingtian looked at Jian Wushuang anew and his complexion was filled with aghastness.

“This move didn’t kill him?”

Mo Lingtian was surprised because he was an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Logically speaking, an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm could outclass a man at the Initial Yang Void Realm easily.

However, Jian Wushuang did not die and he even was able to withstand the attack.

“His battle strength, improved?”

Even Mo Lingtian felt sincerely astonished.
