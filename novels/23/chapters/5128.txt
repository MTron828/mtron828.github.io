The Ultimate Dao!

It was the limit that the starry sky could withstand and the limit that the starry sky could expand.

After grasping the complete limit, one would have already stepped onto the path of controlling the starry sky.

The One Thought Universe was just a miniature of the starry sky. If he was strong enough, the starry sky would descend with a thought. At that time, Jian Wushuang would be truly invincible.

But now, with the One Thought Universe’s miniature version, he could already match a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. Even contending against a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he could still keep up. This was the power of the Ultimate Dao.

Jian Wushuang could make the miniature universe shake the Great Desolate Wilderness Heavenly Dao with his hands. All the skeletons and corpses in the miniature universe were suppressed.

Millions of corpses were like puppets, unable to leave. Only a few corpses with the strength of a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal managed to drag their bodies out of the range of the miniature universe.

“What are you doing?” Xiang Bingyun did not quite understand why he had to use more than half of his strength to suppress these ordinary corpses. Wouldn’t it reduce his burden if these corpses left?

Indeed, if Xiang Bingyun was the only one in the miniature universe, his burden would have been greatly reduced. However, Xiang Bingyun was constantly pestering him. Even if there was no corpse, he would not be able to escape.

Since there was no way to flee, he decided to take drastic measures.

“I warned you, things won’t be as friendly as they were before!

His voice had barely faded when he took control of the entire miniature universe, devouring the boundless Yan Power from the void. It coalesced into countless powerful sword energies. As he struck, innumerable sword energies traversed the void, each possessing the might of his ordinary sword strikes. With a simultaneous release of countless sword energies, they cleaved toward the corpses within the miniature universe.

“Stop it!” Xiang Binyun’s body transformed completely into an ancient behemoth, its claw scattering tens of thousands of sword Qi. However, against the billions of sword Qi, it was almost useless.

He could only watch anxiously as a million skeletons turned into dust. With a thought, he killed a million Grand Yan Immortals. This scene reminded him of Zhen Wuyang from the Ancient Era.

Recalling the humiliation of the past, Xiang Bingyun was furious to the extreme at this moment.

“Today, I want you to die!”

Boom!

Countless corpses and dust fell from the void like snow, and Xiang Bingyun turned into a primordial beast.

Jian Wushuang quickly grabbed the young Monk and teleported!

“Are you going crazy? It seems like we haven’t killed enough!

The little samanera lowered his head and rubbed the Buddha beads in his hand!

“Kind Sir, I’ve already converted these Grand Yan Immortals, you can kill them without worry! i ‘

Xiang Bingyun was so angry that he almost vomited blood. If it wasn’t for the Master’s plan, he would have led several Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals to attack Jian Wushuang.

Outside the ancient bronze temple,

Two figures in black robes sat cross-legged in front of the temple door.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Who is this person exactly? With such strength during the Ancient Era, they should have some reputation, right? Could it be that they have only risen in recent years?

Jian Wushuang possessed the power of Nine Revolutions and could contend with the Perfected Nine Revolutions strength of Xiang Binyun. In their eyes, he was no ordinary individual.

There was a high probability that he was a superpower who had already made a name for himself in the Ancient Era, or else he wouldn’t have come to the Great Desolate Wilderness at this time to investigate their grand plan.

“Tsk tsk, but I can’t tell his identity from his appearance. However, I can feel the aura of Zhen Wuyang on his body. No matter what, I have to make him stay.”

Youdou sat cross-legged on a high seat. He was one of the Left and Right Guardians of the Lord, the closest confidant of the Lord.

“It won’t be that simple to keep him here. You and I must protect the Qishen Temple and not move again. Zhen Wuyang inside the Great Si Region probably already knows about us. We can’t afford to be careless.”

When the grand plan was set, the two of them, along with their leader, entered the Qishen Temple to sleep. Their leader had instructed that when they woke up again, they must guide the corpses to protect the Qishen Temple and not let anyone approach it.

Now was the crucial moment for their leaders revival, and if anything went wrong, they couldn’t bear the consequences.

“Since we can’t kill him, let’s lead him somewhere else! There must not be any more big movements in this place.”

“Agreed!”

Within the miniature universe.

After annihilating a million corpses, the One Thought Universe had weakened considerably. However, without the burden ot the opponent’s corpses, its strength had not decreased much.

Even so, Jian Wushuang couldn’t match Xiang Binyun’s strength head-on and had to keep evading.

“I can’t keep this up. My Thought power has reached its limit. I must shake him off!” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, and his figure changed once more. “The old guy from the Anicent Era is really difficult to deal with.”

Xiang Bingyun’s attack missed. His blood-red eyes turned and he moved his body in an instant. When Jian Wushuang tore open the void and appeared, she predicted his position in advance and stabbed a sharp claw into Jian Wushuangs body.

Golden blood sprayed into the void, but as the spacetime shifted once more, Xiang Binyun quickly moved aside.

It was only after stabilizing his position that he realized everything had been an illusion, and Jian Wushuang had taken advantage of the opportunity to leave a gruesome wound on his back.

“You b*stard!” Xiang Binyun exclaimed.

“Hmph! You’ve got thick skin,” Jian Wushuang retorted.

The battle between the two shook the entire microcosm, and the heavens themselves seemed to howl.

Boom.

A surge of energy, long buried in the ancient era, erupted, sending both combatants staggering.

“Haha, my master has fully awakened! You scoundrel, prepare to die!” The energy emanated from the Qishen Temple, and Jian Wushuang felt a powerful force surging forth.

“Even if the Zhen Wuyang has revived, what can he do? Today, none of you can stop me,” Jian Wushuang declared, his determination shining in his eyes.

How many years had it been? How many battles had he fought? He had often emerged from adversity, but he had never given up on a chance, which had brought him to this day.

“How dare you insult my Lord? Even if the Zhen Wuyang comes today, I will still kill you!’

The glory of the Ancient Era was those Emperors. They, the Grand Yan Immortals, were all illuminated. Insulting His Lord was the same as insulting them, insulting the glory of the Ancient Era.

While the two were locked in battle, a middle-aged man dressed in resplendent attire continually flickered at the edge of the Great Wilderness. Every movement seemed to traverse endless voids, an accomplishment that might take ordinary Grand Yan Immortals hundreds of years, but this middle-aged man could do it in an instant.

When he encountered powerful ancient relics, he simply stormed through them. Formations, spirit guardians, and protectors all instantly crumbled before him, as his strength exceeded the rules of this world.

With a white jade crown on his head and a golden robe, his face exuded n obi lit’ r

This man was none other than Zhen Wuyang.

He had long sensed the disturbances in the Great Desolate Wilderness, originally thinking it was the stubbornness of the Ancient Era wanting to make a comeback. However, he had not anticipated that those old folks would actually control the legendary Qishen Temple.

It was no wonder the Ancient Era had produced five Emperors and so many Grand Yan Immortals..
