5069 A Man with a Passionate Heart

The chaotic void wind dissipated, revealing a rather slender figure.

In their first encounter, the slender figure with the longsword found himself at a disadvantage, which greatly displeased him and left him somewhat incredulous.

However, he quickly concealed his emotions and turned his gaze towards the skinny Yan Immortal kneeling beside him, trembling like a sieve.

Then, he spoke, “Hey, why did he want to kill you?”

The skinny Yan Immortal shuddered, nearly collapsing in the void. He said in a trembling voice, “I-I don’t know, but he has a thirst for blood and killing. All of my companions fell to his hands. If I hadn’t run fast enough, I might have also met a gruesome fate.”

“A bloodthirsty killer for no apparent reason?” The slender figure clearly did not believe his one-sided account. He turned to Jian Wu Shuang and asked loudly, “Is what he’s saying true?”

Jian Wu Shuang responded indifferently, “True or not, what difference does it make?”

“Alright, it seems I’ve encountered yet another rule-breaker,” the slender figure said solemnly. “In that case, you’ll have to pay the price.”

As soon as he said that, an unprecedented Sword Intent erupted and swept up, causing the void to tremble.

Under this Sword Intent, the skinny Yan Immortal who was shaking like a leaf fainted.

Confronted with such a Sword Intent, Jian Wu Shuang’s gaze also became focused.

He sensed a kind of energy fluctuation that did not belong to a Yan Immortal!

This guy who did not show his abilities was actually a Grand Yan Immortal?!

It’s worth noting that after the battle of the Emperors, Grand Yan Immortals had become almost extinct in the entire Great Si Region.

However, Jian Wu Shuang had repeatedly encountered Grand Yan Immortals, and most of them were on opposing sides, which left him feeling quite helpless.

To Jian Wushuang, who had experienced the terrifying training of the Endless Sea, a Grand Yan Immortal was nothing. However, a Grand Yan Immortal with a deep understanding of Sword Principle was enough to give him a headache. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

And judging solely from the Sword Intent he had unleashed, Jian Wu Shuang dared not underestimate him.

The slender figure rose with a drawn sword, igniting a magnificent Sword Intent, and descended directly.

Jian Wushuang did not want to engage in prolonged combat, so he unleashed the Wushuang Sword Dao directly.

Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, the first form.

A plain and unremarkable straight slash, as the initial move of the complete Wushuang Sword Dao, was rare in its focus on explosiveness.

The slender figure was greatly amazed, completely disregarding the Sword Intent surrounding him, and swiftly rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Watching this bizarre scene, Jian Wushuang’s brow twitched. He obviously hadn’t expected that the guy would charge at him like a raging bull.

This undoubtedly disrupted his thoughts, but Jian Wushuang did not retreat. He adjusted his state instantly and took the initiative.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, the second form.

River.

The majestic Heavenly River, breaking through the void from every crack, then roaring as it converged.

Under this sword strike, even a Grand Yan Immortal would feel their own insignificance.

“What a powerful sword move!” the slender figure exclaimed without reservation. “In that case, I’ll show you my strongest move too!”

A colder aura suddenly swept over, centered on the slender figure, and tore through the void.

Then, countless Sword Intents gathered behind him, forming a blazing sun.

The blazing sun was radiant, containing nine crimson-golden rays, resembling a golden wheel, circulating behind him.

Facing the mighty and overwhelming River Sword Intent, the slender figure raised his sword suddenly.

Where the sword pointed, nothing could resist.

At that moment, the brilliant golden radiance burst forth from the sun behind him. The nine crimson-golden rays shot out like nine True Swords, unstoppable.

Where the sword pointed, even the Heavenly River composed of countless pure Sword Intents began to shatter!

Nine True Swords, turning into scorching suns, extinguishing all Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, feeling astonished.

This was the first time that, apart from Sword Immortals, another Sword Dao could contend with the Wushuang Swords Dao.

As the River-form sword intent shattered and dissipated, the nine sun-like True Swords also vanished into nothingness.

Jian Wushuang didn’t mind this and instead focused on the Grand Yan Immortal.

The slender figure appeared unusually excited. “Delightful! I never expected that a Grand Yan Immortal could not only engage me in a swordfight but also suppress me with just one move!”

Jian Wushuang looked at him and did not speak.

“Your Sword Principle—did you learn it from someone or develop it yourself?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him. “Are you done talking?”

The slender figure hesitated for a moment, but he did not get angry. Instead, he scratched his head and said, “Misunderstanding. It was all a misunderstanding.”

“Since it’s a misunderstanding, don’t block my way,” he said in a calm tone. “Also, the person you’re protecting is not a good individual, taking pleasure in ambushing lone Yan Immortals. It just so happened that he and his buddies encountered me, and I casually eliminated them.”

The slender figure was taken aback again, then his expression turned cold. “I had a feeling that this guy wasn’t a good character. It seems my instincts were right!”

With those words, he reached out and lifted the unconscious and skinny Yan Immortal, then without any hesitation, twisted its head off.

After casting another glance at the slender figure, Jian Wushuang turned and left.

There was still a considerable distance to the Great Mi Heaven, and he had no reason to waste any time.

After passing through thousands of Heavenly Regions alone, Jian Wushuang stopped and looked back.

He saw the slender figure holding the decapitated head of the skinny Yan Immortal following him.

“Why are you following me?” Jian Wushuang frowned, growing somewhat annoyed.

The slender figure smiled and said somewhat embarrassed, “There was a misunderstanding earlier, so I wanted to make it up to you.”

“Whether there was a misunderstanding or not, what if he was telling the truth, and I was lying?” Jian Wushuang said, “It’s all just one-sided claims. How can we determine the truth?”

“The sword! Sword Intent,” the slender figure suddenly asserted with determination. “Your Sword Intent won’t deceive me. To produce such pure Sword Intent as a Yan Immortal, if there were impurities in your state of mind, you would never have comprehended this level of swordsmanship.”

“Alright, let’s put this matter behind us. I’ll continue on my way, and you don’t need to follow me anymore,” Jian Wushuang said before turning and leaving.

Tossing the head in his hand into the void, the slender figure watched his departing silhouette. After careful consideration, he still decided to catch up.

“May I ask, Young Friend, where are you headed? How about we travel together?” he inquired.

“No.”

“…”
