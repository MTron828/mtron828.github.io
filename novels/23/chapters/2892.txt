Chapter 2893: Transfer

——

Hearing Chu Shi’s words, Jian Wushuang’s frown deepened.

He knew that Leng Rushuang was a loner. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In his previous life, Leng Rushuang was such a loner.

However, Jian Wushuang did not expect that some things about Leng Rushuang were so secret in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion that even genius disciples like Chu Shi were not qualified to know about it. Only the top Immortal Saints knew about it.

“I wanted to find out about Shuang ‘er’s background and her high talent from Chu Shi. Besides, Shuang ‘er is only a Divine Master, but she is ranked third on the Dragon-phoenix list. There must be some important secrets. But now, it seems that I have to find the Immortal Saint from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.” Jian Wushuang pondered.

There were a total of three known Immortal Saints in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. These three should know about it.

However, some of Leng Rushuang’s matters were kept a secret within the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Even if he went to inquire about it, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would most likely not tell him. Unless he had the ability to make the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion bow to him, such as reaching the level of the Bone Emperor.

But now, although he had killed two Immortal Saints in the previous battle, and his battle strength was terrifying enough to make the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion take him seriously and not dare to underestimate him, he still could not make the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion bow to him.

“Forget it. I can only think of a way to deal with the matter of Shuang Er after I become stronger,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He had made up his mind that he would visit Leng Rushuang when he was stronger. By then, he would know everything about Leng Rushuang’s life even in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion…

“You can go.”

Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

After Jian Wushuang left, Chu Shi and the other two finally let out a sigh of relief.

Chu Shi was especially worried that Jian Wushuang would kill him. After all, he had offended Jian Wushuang before.

“Senior brother Chu Shi, was that really Jian Yi? The monster who killed two Immortal Saints?” A disciple from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion looked over.

“Who else could it be?” Chu Shi glanced at the disciple and then said seriously, “Let’s go back. We have to report this to Elder Qin and the others.”

Chu Shi and the other two immediately went back to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

…

After seeing Chu Shi, Jian Wushuang held back his excitement.

Instead of waiting outside the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he went back to the Pill Sun Sacred World.

This time, he came back to solve the awkward situation of the Sword Alliance in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

After all, the Pill Sun Sacred World was now completely under the control of the Crimson Rock Castle. All the forces listened to the orders of the Crimson Rock Castle, but the Sword Alliance had always been very special.

After all, the Sword Alliance was very powerful, and the key was the existence of the Alliance Master. The Crimson Rock Castle could not control the Sword Alliance at all. Even the experts in the Sword Alliance had always wanted to expand and replace the Crimson Rock Castle, they were just suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

However, this suppression could not last long. Therefore, Jian Wushuang had already planned for the Sword Alliance.

The best way was to conquer a world and move the Sword Alliance completely to the Sacred World.

Now, the opportunity had come.

In the lofty hall of the Sword Alliance, Jian Wushuang sat on the throne at the top, Xiao Tiexin stood beside him, and many experts of the Sword Alliance looked at Jian Wushuang with respect and worship.

In the Sword Alliance, Jian Wushuang was God and heaven. There was no doubt about that.

Jian Wushuang glanced at these experts and nodded slightly.

He had not left the Pill Sun Sacred World for a long time. During this time, Xiao Tiexin clearly followed his orders and did not expand to the outside world. There were not many more experts in the Sword Alliance than before.

“Everyone, I have called you here today for one thing.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated throughout the hall. “I will give you one year to prepare. After one year, all the experts of the Sword Alliance will leave the Pill Sun Sacred World with me.”

As soon as Jian Wushuang said this, the entire hall was in an uproar.

Most people were baffled and did not know what Jian Wushuang meant.

“Young master,” Xiao Tiexin also asked, “Are you going to take the entire Sword Alliance out of the Pill Sun Sacred World?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Where to?” Xiao Tiexin asked again.

“To the Heaven Curve World,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Heaven Curve World?” Many experts of the Sword Alliance still frowned.

These experts were very weak. Only Elder Tong, Snake Elder, and Great Divine Master Jue Xin were Great Divine Masters. The rest were only Divine Masters.

Apart from Elder Tong, the rest of them had never ventured outside. They did not know much about the situation outside. To them, the Pill Sun Sacred World was not small at all, they had already accumulated a certain amount of foundation here. Of course, they did not want to leave.

Not to mention them, even Xiao Tiexin, Jian Wushuang’s intimate maid, did not want to leave.

Jian Wushuang naturally noticed the changes in the expressions of the people in front of him. He immediately lowered his voice, “One mountain can not accommodate two tigers. The Pill Sun Sacred World already has the Crimson Rock Castle, so it can not accommodate a Sword Alliance that is not weaker than Crimson Rock Castle, or even stronger. The Heaven Curve World is much larger than the Pill Sun Sacred World, with more experts and a bigger platform!”

“Most importantly, I have killed the world master of the Heaven Curve World. I will bring the corpse puppet army to Heaven Curve World immediately. With a wave of my hand, I can wipe out all the resistance forces and experts in the heaven curve world, so that the sword union can occupy the vast Sacred World safely. This is the best result for the Sword Alliance.

“Of course, I know that you are all born in the Pill Sun Sacred World, and your roots are here. You don’t want to leave so easily, so I won’t force you. In short, those who are willing to go with me will leave in a year. If not, I will give you a batch of resources and let you leave. But in a year, there will be no Sword Alliance in the Pill Sun Sacred World!”

Jian Wushuang said firmly without any room for negotiation.

He had made this decision long ago. His original purpose in founding the Sword Alliance was to help the Crimson Rock Castle regain control of the Pill Sun Sacred World.

He would never allow the Sword Alliance to threaten the status of the Crimson Rock Castle. Now that he had conquered a holy world for the Sword Alliance and completely transferred the Sword Alliance there, he had done his best as the Alliance Master.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, many experts of the Sword Alliance were shocked.

They all heard that Jian Wushuang had killed the Realm Lord of the Heaven Curve World with his own hands.

A Realm Lord should be an Immortal Saint, right?
