Chapter 648: The Fourth Round of Genius Battles

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As the host was explaining everything, his sonorous voice echoed throughout the place.

“What kind of person could be called a genius?

“Someone who can achieve in one year what it takes others 10 years!

“For example, it may take an ordinary man thousands of years to reach the Eternal Realm from the Skyscraping Realm, but a real genius can do that within just hundreds of years.

“Time can prove many things.

“Therefore, with all of you being in the Skyscraping Realm, the time that you’ve spent cultivating to reach that realm and how long you’ve been in it will be the best proof of your talent. This is how the fourth round works.”

Upon hearing this, the geniuses were finally able to understand the rule.

It was true that one’s talent and potential could be seen through his years of cultivation.

Taking the ordinary warriors in the Ancient World as an example, from the day they started cultivating, it might take one of them hundreds of years to reach the Saint Realm, while for someone else, just dozens of years to achieve the same thing. Needless to say, the latter was clearly more gifted.

Having said that, the rule of the fourth round was practicable indeed.

“I never thought that our cultivation time would be the measurement of the fourth round.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huo Ying frowned tightly and echoed in an undertone. “I have to admit that it makes sense, but the point is that we’re from Ancient World.

“The less favorable conditions in our world decrees that it takes us more time to reach the Skyscraping Realm than those from the Eternal World.”

Someone chimed in. “Yes, you’re right. It’s unfair.”

“Unfair indeed.” Feng nodded in agreement.

The five geniuses from the Ancient World all complained about the rule, as they knew that they were doomed to lose this battle.

Due to the poor cultivating conditions in their homeworld, they had all spent a rather long time in cultivation, especially Huo Ying.

“We have no chance to beat them if we compare our cultivation ages.”

By this time, they were sufficiently discontented.

However, Jian Wushuang might have been the exception among them.

He had an odd expression while thinking,?“The measurement will be cultivation time? Well, it hasn’t been long since I started cultivating.”

In the Skyward Pavilion, the experts from the sects glanced at those geniuses from the Ancient World with eyes full of pity.

“Those poor boys are going to be embarrassed.”

“That’s for sure. Being born with limited resources, in no way could they cultivate faster than those from the Eternal World.”

“Considering that it’s so hard for them to break through to the Skyscraping Realm in the Ancient World, all six of them must have cultivated for a thousand years. The mighty Jian Wushuang among them might have cultivated even longer. He probably is three or four thousand years old now.”

“Those from the Eternal World are far superior to them. I reckon that few of them have cultivated for over 800 years.”

“Gong Chao, Jing Xianzi, Qianqiu Wuhen, and Jian Wushuang, I dearly want to know how long they have cultivated. Especially Jian Wushuang, I’d love to see if he really is over the age of 4,000.”

“But, we all know that an ordinary Skyscraping Realm expert can’t live for more than 4,000 years, so Jian Wushuang should be under that age. Even if he has taken some precious elixirs to prolong his life, he can’t make it to more than 5,000 years old, all the same.”

Those experts were waiting to see Jian Wushuang and the other five lost face.

On the Drill Ground, with a gesture from the host, a short elder turned up who had a special aura.

“This is Elder Qiu.” The host introduced the elder to the geniuses. “He has some unique methods to examine your cultivation age and the time you’ve been in the Skyscraping Realm. Now, go take your examination one by one when I read your name.” After glancing around, the host read out the first name: “Gu Ling!”

The man named Gu Ling immediately walked over to the elder.

“I need a drop of your blood,” Elder Qiu said to him.

Doing as ordered, Gu Ling gave the elder a drop of blood, which was then put into a special container. A moment later, the results came out.

“Your cultivation age is no more than 350 years, and you’ve been in the Skyscraping Realm for 200 years,” Elder Qiu announced directly.

“350 years? Not bad.” The experts in Skyward Pavilion praised him.

The host continued, “The next one is...”

One by one, the geniuses went forward to take the test.

The results showed that most of the geniuses from the Eternal World had a short cultivation age, with a range of 300 to 500 years. A small number of them had an age of 600 years. But there were very few with a cultivation age over 800 years.

After the previous three rounds, the weak had been eliminated and only the strong remained. 800 years were sufficient for a strong one to become a Divine Realm expert, which was impossible for the geniuses from the Ancient World, however.

“Qianqiu Wuhen!”

When Qianqiu Wuhen’s name was called, everyone looked at him.

As one of those most outstanding geniuses, he had gotten much attention from others.

In a minute or two, Elder Qiu announced his result.

“Your cultivation age is between 780 and 790 years, and you’ve been stuck in the Skyscraping Realm for over 600 years.”

Qianqiu Wuhen’s result was beyond the expectations of everyone in the Skyward Pavilion and those who had thought highly of him.

780 years in cultivation and 600 years in the Skyscraping Realm were rather long times compared with those of the geniuses in the Eternal World. In view of this, Qianqiu Wuhen’s talent was not that satisfying despite his mighty power.
