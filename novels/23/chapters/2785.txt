Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The experts from Heavenly Modest Palace and under the lead of Blood Thunder King who were escaping managed to do so.

On the battlefield, many of the experts from Yin Su’er’s faction and the Sword Alliance stood there. They were shocked when they saw Blood Thunder King”s body fall down slowly.

As the leader of one of the three biggest factions in the Crimson Stone Fort, Blood Thunder King had been controlling the Crimson Stone Official Army since long ago and he had a high prestige in the Crimson Stone Fort.

For a long period of time, Blood Thunder King had been having a crazy fight with Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s factions.

Right now, Blood Thunder King has finally died.

“With the death of Blood Thunder King, his faction will naturally break apart. Yun Shan’s faction had also been badly hit and they aren’t capable of causing anymore trouble. Has the lengthy internal battles of the Crimson Stone Fort finally ended?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen mumbled to himself but his heart was secretly filled with melancholy.

Beside him, many of the experts from Yin Su’er’s faction had a complicated feeling.

The Crimson Stone Fort was originally the publicly recognized domineering party in the Danyang Holy Domain.

It was originally a huge force but their strength had been continuously weakened as internal battles had never stopped after the death of the Crimson Stone Saint.

However, such fights had finally come to an end.

Among all the factions in the Crimson Stone Fort, the person who managed to stand to the end was still the true descendant of the Crimson Stone Fort, Yin Su’er!!

“Has it finally ended?” Yin Su’er also mumbled as her body slightly trembled.

“The internal fight of the Crimson Stone Fort has ended but you shouldn’t be happy so early on.” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

Yin Su’er slightly focused her line of sight.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen and the others had turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“This battle took a long period of time from battling Yun Shan’s faction in the beginning to defeating the Heavenly Modest Palace and Blood Thunder King’s faction. It’s impossible that the pinnacle forces of the Danyang Continent did not realize what’s happening in such a long period of time. However, we still haven’t seen any of them until now.” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

The facial expressions of the people there turned into a serious one when they heard this.

It was true that Yin Su’er planned to have a swift battle previously. She wanted to defeat Yun Shan and Blood Thunder King’s factions before the pinnacle forces realized what was happening.

However, the truth was that they had used too much time.

This was also because the appearance of the Heavenly Modest Palace was unexpected. They had no other option but to spend such a long period of time defeating the Heavenly Modest Palace and Blood Thunder King’s faction.

Such a long period of time was sufficient for the pinnacle forces to prepare themselves.

“If I guessed correctly, the experts from the four pinnacle forces, Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect and Dongfang Clan had arrived near Bane City. The reason they did not show themselves is because they are waiting for both sides to suffer losses and they shall benefit from our dispute after the results are out.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Now that the battle is over, the experts from these four pinnacle forces are about to show themselves.” The experts in the surrounding area started looking at the surrounding voids after they heard what Jian Wushuang said.

Certainly...

“There they are!!” An exclaiming voice could be heard.

Everybody immediately followed the voice and looked in that direction. A large number of densely packed black spots could be seen at the edge of a far away void.

These black spots were rushing over at an extraordinary speed. Within moments, a huge number of figures had appeared before Jian Wushuang and the others. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Waves of domineering divine power came spreading from these figures.

As they felt this divine power, Jian Wushuang, Yin Su’er and the experts under their lead had darkened expressions on their faces.

“Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Dongfang Clan and the badly wounded Divine Demon Sect had really come over.” Yin Su’er gritted her teeth as the look in her eyes turned to a cold one.

At this moment, the people standing in front of them were the experts from these four pinnacle forces.

The appearance of these four pinnacle forces at the same time meant that they had united and formed a coalition force.

However, the coalition force of these four pinnacle forces was extremely strong!!

The experts that arrived on scene were of the Grand Ultimate God level and there were more than 50 of them!!

That was right, more than 50 Grand Ultimate Gods. This was the combat power formed when the four pinnacle forces united.

Among them, the strongest Nanwu Palace had almost 20 Grand Ultimate Gods. As the Life and Death Tower and Dongfang Clan almost sent everybody that they had, it was also a significant number from their side.

As for the Divine Demon Sect, as they were badly defeated and lost nine Grand Ultimate Gods previously, they could only come up with a couple of Grand Ultimate Gods due to the pressure they withstand from the outside world throughout the years. However, these four pinnacle forces still accumulated more than 50 Grand Ultimate Gods in total.

Such a number of Grand Ultimate Gods in a holy domain was sufficient to scare one to death!

If the Crimson Stone Fort was still in its peak era or before the bigger factions had not really fought, an alliance between Yin Su’er, Yun Shan and Blood Thunder King’s factions might be sufficient to withstand the coalition force between these four pinnacle forces.

However, the Blood Thunder King’s faction had been completely defeated and he was dead right now.

Yun Shan’s faction had also suffered a horrendous blow and only four badly wounded people were left alive.

Even the strongest faction that belonged to Yin Su’er had also lost many Grand Ultimate Gods in two consecutive battles. Those that were still alive were wounded and had suffered a great depletion in their divine power. Even if they considered the Sword alliance, the combat power of Grand Ultimate Gods that they had at the moment were less than 30 people.

Apart from that, all four pinnacle forces had Peak Grand Ultimate Gods as their leaders and that meant that the coalition force had a total of four Peak Grand Ultimate Gods. Among them, Nanwu Palace Master was even the publicly recognized number one expert in the Danyang Holy Domain.

In terms of the highest combat power level, the alliance of the four pinnacle forces had complete superiority.

In the void on top of Bane City, the coalition force stood facing Jian Wushuang, Yin Su’er and the others some distance away.

The experts in the coalition force formed by those four pinnacle forces were extremely excited at that moment.

“Haha... Yin Su’er and Su Han, the two of you had put on a good show for us.” Nanwu Palace Master’s loud laugh could be heard reverberating throughout the entire sky and land.

The coalition force formed of those four pinnacle forces had received news since early on and they had immediately rushed over.

When they arrived, the fight between Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s factions had not ended so they had seen almost the entirety of this great battle. That included the last minute team changing of the Sword Alliance, appearance of the experts from the Heavenly Modest Palace and also the attack Jian Wushuang carried out in the end that wiped out everything. They also saw the scene of him killing Blood Thunder King.

“Su Han, no, I should call you Jian Yi. Your way surprises even me.” Nanwu Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile on his face.

The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master beside him also looked at Jian Wushuang with weird looks on their faces.

Only Dong Shen, the Divine Demon Sect Master, looked at Jian Wushuang with a huge amount of anger and will to kill.
