In the void, Jian Wushuang was traveling forward slowly but he was astonished.

“Jiu Chou from earlier was really powerful and he was very close to the top twenty on the Universe God ranking list. Such strong a Universe God, but he wasn’t famous at all?” Jian Wushuang complimented in silence.

“Jian Wushuang, you must understand that Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries is huge. There are so many experts and not every expert is famous. There are experts who possess amazing power but have kept a low profile and hardly revealed their true power. Such experts remained unknown to the public. There are tons of them in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!”

“The birth of Wu Bei’s cave gathered most of the Universe Gods who were not famous here. Hence, don’t belittle anyone just because he isn’t famous or not listed on the Universe God ranking list,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“True. Jiu Chou who popped out of nowhere has the fighting power of one in the top thirty in Universe God ranking list. Among the experts who are not famous but in Wei Bei’s cave, there must be some who are stronger than Jiu Chou. I reckon some experts who could be compared favorably with the top ten monsters might appear too,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He could imagine that the Universe God ranking list would definitely go through an unprecedented, radical shake-up after the grand fight banquet.

After making the fact known, Jian Wushuang became more careful and cautious with every action he took in Wu Bei’s cave.

The time flew past.

Although Wu Bei’s cave was extremely spacious, after the Universe Gods probed inch by inch, one Iron Wing Beast was found after another and then killed. Even though most of the Iron Wing Beasts had no White Blaze Fruits in their bodies, there were a few that had one.

Once a White Blaze Fruit appeared, it would cause a fight.

On the thirteenth day after Jian Wushuang had entered Wu Bei’s cave, someone found the sixth White Blaze Fruit. The one who found the White Blaze Fruit was a Universe God in the top ten on Universe God ranking list. Even though there were many Universe Gods around him who saw when he got the White Blaze Fruit, there was no one who had the guts to fight for it. Hence, the sixth White Blaze Fruit didn’t cause a great commotion.

On the eighteenth day, the seventh White Blaze Fruit appeared and the White Blaze Fruit was in the hands of an ordinary Universe God. The Universe God just got it out of the Iron Wing Beast’s body and the others killed it very soon. Then, it transformed into carnage immediately. After a ferocious battle, the White Blaze Fruit fell into the hands of an expert in the twenty-seventh place on the Universe God ranking list.

There were more than a hundred Universe Gods who had died from the battle. Among the dead, there were two experts on Universe God ranking list that passed away.

It was extremely mad.

On the twentieth day after Jian Wushuang had entered Wu Bei’s cave, Lei Chao sent him updated news. The monster on the second place on Universe God ranking list, King Jin Wu, came.

Since then, the ten monsters on the Universe God ranking list, there were a total of seven that were there!

…

After Jian Wushuang had wandered in Wu Bei’s cave for a month, shocking news suddenly spread.

Demon Girl Ling Luo, who was on the third place on Universe God ranking list, was challenged by a mysterious man in Wu Bei’s cave and she was defeated and killed on the spot!

When the news spread, it immediately stirred a mighty uproar in Wu Bei’s cave.

The top ten on the Universe God ranking list, also known as the ten monsters. They were widely recognized as the scariest ten people out of all of the Universe Gods.

To be able to be in the top three on the Universe God ranking list, they were surely the monsters of the monsters. Such monsters could easily kill a Real God and their power made one hopeless. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, the monster on the third place on Universe God ranking list had lost to a person who wasn’t famous at all. It was naturally astonishing.

Outside the island, in the lofty palace, where many Almighties and representatives of each forces and sects had gathered.

Compared to a month before, there was obviously more experts in the palace. Even Almighties… There were about twenty-five Almighties on the scene.

At that very moment, the experts were all discussing Demon Girl Ling Luo being defeated.

“The superb genius in third place on Universe God ranking list, she lost just like that.”

“We guessed earlier that there would definitely be a radical shake up on the Universe God ranking list. However, the monsters in the top ten shouldn’t change much, especially the top three. Who would have guessed that before the opening of Wu Bei’s cave in two months time, one of the top three would already be defeated.”

“The mysterious man who defeated Demon Girl Ling Luo, who was it? Any names?”

“No. According to the news I heard, the mysterious man didn’t announce his name when he challenged Demon Girl Ling Luo but instantly took action. He uses a knife as his weapon. His Knife Principle is so terrifying. He comprehended Darkness Doctrine and Massacre Doctrine of Nine Heaven God Doctrine at the same time. His Darkness Doctrine definitely possesses the ability to pass the first level of Doctrine Palace. Although his comprehension towards Massacre Doctrine has not reached the first level, it’s about there.”

“Tsk tsk. Comprehended two Powers of Heaven Way at the same time and with such a high comprehension level. He’s so impressive.

“From the opening of Wu Bei’s cave until now, there have been quite a number of experts who weren’t famous before that revealed surprising power in the cave. There were many who possessed the fighting powers of one on the Universe God ranking list. However, the mysterious man who used a knife should be the strongest.”

Real Gods from each force were chatting among themselves.

In a higher place in the palace, the twenty five Almighties scattered around.

“Tower Master Qi Fu, the latest Universe God ranking list, have you sorted it out yet?” A red-haired elderly with a unicorn on his forehead asked casually.

“Don’t be in a hurry,” Tower Master Qi Fu shook his head and smiled, “The grand banquet has just started. A ferocious fight leads to a radical shake-up of Universe God ranking list. It isn’t easy for Vientiane Tower to tidy them up. Plus, although there are some people who have revealed their powers, Vientiane Tower has yet to find out their true identity. Just like the young man who defeated Ling Luo, Vientiane Tower has yet to find out who he is. How do we announce the list?”

“That’s true,” the red-haired elderly nodded faintly.

“Wait a little while more. When the list is sorted, we naturally will announce it,” Tower Master Qi Fu said.

In Wu Bei’s cave.

Jian Wushuang had already received the news of Demon Girl Ling Luo being defeated.

“Awesome guy. He could even shake the monster on the third place on Universe God ranking list. Out of the Universe Gods who came to Wu Bei’s cave, there are so many hidden talents,” Jian Wushuang complimented in silence.

He knew long ago that many experts who weren’t famous would come to join the grand banquet.

Just like the few people he had found out from Lei Chao previously. Although they weren’t listed on the Universe God ranking list, they were suspected to possess fighting powers like one in the top ten of Universe God ranking list.

But the person who had appeared then was the most eye-catching one. He plunged into the top three on the Universe God ranking list with one attack.

“It seems that if I hadn’t cultivated in Real God Hall for four months and mastered a slight bit of Power of Spacetime, my position as the twentieth on the Universe God ranking list would be quite difficult to maintain,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Just then…
