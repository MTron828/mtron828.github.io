Chapter 3100: Black Divine Pillar

——

In the open space in the center of the Heaven-cleaving Star, the geniuses of the three palaces had left long ago. Now, only the Peak True Saint was waiting there.

Sou!

A figure suddenly landed.

“Lord Mo Shan.” The Peak True Saint bowed respectfully.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you haven’t come out yet?” Mo Shan looked over.

“Yes.” The Peak True Saint nodded.

“It’s been 60 years. This kid has been in Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm for a long time. I’m afraid no one has been in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm longer than him,” Mo Shan said.

“In the history of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, the longest time spent in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm has only been 42 years. As for the three people who entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm this time, Piercing Tiger only stayed in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm for three years before coming out. Thunder God stayed for 12 years, but none of them lasted as long as Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the Peak True Saint added.

“The longer I stay in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, the more opportunities I’ll get under normal circumstances. I just don’t know what kind of opportunities this little guy got in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm,” Mo Shan muttered.

There were countless opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, but no one in the outside world knew what kind of opportunities the people who entered had.

Right at this time…weng!

The void in front of them suddenly trembled, and then a space passage slowly appeared in front of Mo Shan and the Peak True Saint.

“Finally coming out?” Mo Shan’s eyes lit up.

Not long after the space passage appeared, a figure slowly stepped out of the space passage.

This figure was undoubtedly Jian Wushuang.

“Elder Mo Shan.”

Jian Wushuang had just come out of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm when he saw Mo Shan in front of him.

“Haha, my friend, you finally came out of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.” Mo Shan greeted him with a smile.

“Finally?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “Senior, do you mean that I have stayed in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm for a long time?”

“A whole 60 years. Do you think it’s a long time?” Mo Shan asked with interest.

“60 years?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

In the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, he was completely immersed in the vast information of the six paths of reincarnation secret skill. He had long forgotten the passage of time. In that state, he felt that it had not been long, but he did not expect that…it had been 60 years.

“My friend, you have stayed in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm for 60 years. You must have gained a lot, right?” Mo Shan looked at him.

“I have.” Jian Wushuang smiled. Then his body shook, and a strong divine power aura burst out.

“This is…a rank three True Saint?” Mo Shan stared at him. “You actually broke through from a rank one true saint to a rank three True Saint in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?”

Mo Shan was also quite surprised.

After all, it was very difficult to break through every level when one’s strength reached the level of a True Saint.

Under normal circumstances, it would take a long time to break through from a rank one True Saint to a rank three True Saint.

“My friend, what kind of opportunity did you get in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?” Mo Shan could not help asking.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment, but he said directly, “After I entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, I came to a strange space surrounded by a large amount of gray airflow. Not long after, a huge black stone pillar appeared in front of me. There were some strange golden words on the black stone pillar.”

“Black stone pillar? Golden words?” Mo Shan and the Peak True Saint next to him looked at each other. The next moment, both of them were shocked.

“Heaven-reaching divine pillar!”

“Yes, it’s the Black Divine Pillar!”

Mo Shan and the Peak True Saint both cried out in surprise.

“My friend, you actually saw the Black Divine Pillar?” Mo Shan’s expression was very interesting.

“Black Divine Pillar? I think so. Why, is the Black Divine Pillar so amazing?” Jian Wushuang asked calmly.

“Of course it’s amazing.” Mo Shan said immediately, “There are countless opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, and these opportunities vary in size and are extremely precious. But if the biggest opportunity in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is undoubtedly the Black Divine Pillar!

“The Alliance Master brought it back from a special place in the universe battlefield a long time ago. It’s said that this Black Divine Pillar contains a big secret, and in the center of the Divine Pillar are ancient golden characters. No one can recognize those golden characters, but each golden character contains a big opportunity!”

“My friend, since you saw those golden words, you must have tried to comprehend them, right?” Mo Shan stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course. I got a complete secret skill by communicating with one of the golden words,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Sure enough.” Mo Shan smiled. “Each of those golden words contains an extremely powerful secret skill that can reach the heavens. Generally, as long as the conditions are right, you can more or less comprehend some of them…”

Before Mo Shan could finish his words, he suddenly thought of something. He immediately looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “My friend, what did you say? Did you get a complete secret skill?”

“Complete secret skill?” The True Saint beside him was also surprised.

“It’s a complete secret skill. Why?” Jian Wushuang asked in puzzlement.

“Are you sure it’s complete?” Mo Shan was in disbelief.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Besides, after I got the complete secret skill, the golden words were printed on my hand. look.”

Jian Wushuang stretched out his right hand, with the back of his hand facing Mo Shan.

On the back of his right hand, there was a very obvious golden word.

“This, this…” Mo Shan was completely stunned. “Even the golden word was printed on your hand? You actually got a complete secret skill.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Elder Mo Shan, from your words, is it strange that you obtained a complete secret skill?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“Of course it’s strange.” Mo Shan’s expression became serious. “My friend, you don’t know. Since the creation of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, who knows how many years have passed, and the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm has existed for a long time. During this period, the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm will open every 10,000 years. Every time it opens, three geniuses will enter. After so many years, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has opened countless times. There are also countless geniuses who have entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm!”

“However, over the years, among the geniuses who had entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, only eight of them were lucky enough to see the Black Divine Pillar. Even if you were included, there were only nine of them.

“And among the eight people before you, they all comprehended a secret technique from the golden characters on the Black Divine Pillar, but most of the secret techniques they comprehended were incomplete. In most cases, they could only obtain about thirty to forty percent of a secret technique. Even the most powerful ones could only comprehend seventy percent of a secret technique!!”
