Chapter 5443 ¬†War God Gao Da

However, since the other party could speak and exhibited consciousness, he had to take it seriously. Like him, the other was on the Ultimate Dao, and there was still respect in his heart.

"I am Jian Wushuang, please enlighten me!" Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and a long sword appeared in his grasp.

The silver-armored youth, with an arrogant demeanor and a high fighting spirit, coldly said, "I am Gao Da, the War God, remember my title!"

After speaking, he directly transformed into a white tiger war beast and charged forward.

The momentum was unstoppable.

At least a peak-level tier 4 formidable strength.

At this level, it posed no threat to Jian Wushuang, but he couldn't afford to be careless. In case the opponent had some special tricks, it wouldn't be good if he made a mistake.

Hoo!

A fierce claw tore through the sky and instantly reached him.

However, facing the ferocious white tiger beast, Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the true form of War God Gao Da.

To crack such a fierce attack, he had to confront it head-on.

Jian Wushuang thrust his sword directly at Gao Da. This sword strike had at least the strength of a peak-level tier 4, and the opponent had to stop to defend against it, or else face defeat.

Smack!

He didn't expect that the opponent not only did not stop but even increased the force, and his aura continued to skyrocket.

Jian Wushuang was initially hit by the sharp claw, and it tore his outer robe, revealing the dark red armor underneath.

The hard claws against the soft armor didn't produce a huge sound, but Jian Wushuang felt a weight on his chest.

Breaking through his inner armor was impossible, but there was still a tremendous impact. It was not something he could endure for long.

However, the opponent's strength was still lacking, and he had not been injured yet.

Now, it was his turn.

A sword thrust out, aiming straight at the opponent's forehead.

At the next moment, Gao Da's helmet materialized on the white tiger's head, enveloping it.

Jian Wushuang's sword had minimal impact, not piercing the helmet, naturally causing little damage. However, even so, Gao Da still suffered minor injuries.

This was a full-force strike with the might of a¬†peak-level tier 4, but it did not break the helmet. The armor on the opponent's body was at least an imitation of an Eternal Treasure, and a top-notch one at that.

Even top-grade Innate Treasures, Jian Wushuang could shatter them, but what could withstand his strikes were only imitations of Eternal Treasures.

As for true Eternal Treasures, even supreme-peak experts couldn't break through them, let alone him.

That the opponent could withstand it was within his expectations; the strongest Dao Lord of the Three Kings Court had an Eternal Treasure on him, and that didn't surprise Jian Wushuang.

After being pushed back, Gao Da revealed a look of shock and exclaimed, "Are you also a Dao Lord?"

"Why not?" Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Although the opponent was the strongest first Dao Lord of the Three Kings Court, his status was not particularly high, not even catching the eyes of the Three Kings.

Even if his combat power was extraordinary and his talent was formidable, he might not be able to integrate the Dao and become the Universe Master, especially when compared to the current extravagance of the Qishen Temple.

For these extraordinarily talented Dao Lords, at most, they would be cultivated a bit more, unlike the current situation in the Qishen Temple, which was more exaggerated.

The former was cultivating elite warriors, while the latter was selecting Inheritors. It was different.

In terms of knowledge and realm, Jian Wushuang far surpassed Gao Da.

The opponent's spatial realm was not very stable in the starry sky realm, with two stars orbiting delicately.

But Jian Wushuang had already mastered the power of half a black hole.

How powerful this is.

"You're too close!"

Jian Wushuang's ancient sword lifted, and Heaven's Punishment followed.

After Heaven's Punishment came the Suppression!

"Fall!" Countless Sword Intents rose, and with the word 'Suppress', this ancient Dao Lord, renowned in ancient times, was directly sealed.

The supreme Dao expanded, and with a thought, the sealed divine body and physical form shattered, while the Origin Source entered the black hole formed by Jian Wushuang.

It seemed easy to defeat the opponent, but in reality, the opponent's strength was considerable, reaching about the peak-level of tier 4.

Especially when he resisted Jian Wushuang's final sword strike, the released aura was formidable. A Dao Lord who had reached perfection in the Ultimate Dao was not to be underestimated; none of them were simple.

The First True King looked on with envy.

Jian Wushuang's potential and strength exceeded his expectations. He had originally thought that Jian Wushuang's path in the Ultimate Dao wouldn't go far. Now it seemed to surpass his understanding.

A Dao Lord, this powerful, was even stronger than he had been when he was a Dao Lord.

"Senior, is this stage considered cleared?" Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword, rising into the air to face Grandmaster.

Grandmaster didn't say much. This space instantly disappeared, and the two reappeared on the chessboard.

"Not bad, but to obtain my inheritance, it's not that simple."

After speaking, the First True King began to emit a powerful aura, though it was not overpowering, only at the level of a Dao Lord.

Jian Wushuang was surprised!

What did this mean?

Grandmaster calmly said, "According to my original plan, defeating Gao Da would give you the ability to become my successor. However, I've changed my mind now!"

"To defeat me is your only way out!"

Jian Wushuang was greatly shocked, "What?" Defeat the First True King!

How is that possible?

Even though he knew that the aura on the other party was just that of a Dao Lord, the disparity in realms seemed quite significant!

The other party was a dominant figure from ancient times, within the Moro temporal space, a supreme powerhouse. Even if his strength was suppressed to that of a Dao Lord, he was by no means an opponent.

His spatial realm was insignificant when compared to Grandmaster, who had a complete time Origin Source.

Half a Black Hole realm might be sufficient against others, but facing an old monster, it was too inadequate.

Grandmaster thought that by intimidating Jian Wushuang in this manner, he didn't realize that instead of being intimidated, Jian Wushuang became more excited.

The more difficult it was, the more he gained.

As for failure?

He never considered it, nor did he doubt that he would fail.

To defeat the First True King, he needed not just the realm but a power surpassing that of the First True King. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The First True King's realm was high, but the Origin Source Dao for Dao Lord was the Ultimate Dao. Even if it was the ninth layer of the Ultimate Dao, he wasn't inferior. Earlier, he defeated a Dao Lord who had reached the perfection of the Ultimate Dao.

As for the divine body, Jian Wushuang could sense that the opponent had a 30,000-fold divine body, while the physical body was average.

Even if the opponent's spatial realm reached perfection, and the time Origin Source traveled a long way, the power converted from these had limits.

For a Dao Lord to unleash such tremendous power was unrealistic.

Jian Wushuang's fighting spirit surged, and he declared resolutely, "Bring it on!"

Hum!

A full-scale eruption!

Without any concealment, he had no reason to hide anything in front of a dead man.

The divine body began to expand, soaring directly from the basic 15,000-fold to 30,000-fold.

Then, he transformed into the Heavenly Demon form.

Eternal Transformation!

Jian Wushuang didn't expect that the secret technique that amplified the Origin Source could have such a miraculous effect on the Heavenly Demon technique.

His divine body and the Origin Source were both ascending, and the physical body showed no signs of weakness.

Originally, it was thought that Jian Wushuang's physical body couldn't withstand such immense power, but as Grandmaster looked on, he was stunned.
