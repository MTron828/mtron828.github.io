2026 Lin Tianhao

The rotation battles for the top nine were ongoing.

Jian Wushuang had naturally disguised himself flawlessly. Regardless of his character or power, they were perfectly concealed.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had completed seven battles. The result was five victory and two defeats.

Such results ensured that he would be in the top five to enter Imperial Peak.

The final battle was interesting because his last opponent was Lin Tianhao.

Just as he entered Imperial City, he argued with him. They had even fought.

Then, Lin Tianhao had told him to be careful when they were to go against each other in the ranking competition. In the end, they were going to fight a battle.

“Brother Haotian, you have to take care of this silly b*stard. Teach him a lesson,” the lady in green gritted through her teeth.

The lady in green was originally in the top nine and she could be in the top five with her power so she could enter the Imperial City. However, no one had expected Ah Shou to appear from nowhere. In the end, the lady in green had been defeated by Jian Wushuang.

It would be impossible if she wanted to enter Imperial Peak. She had to wait for another hundred years.

Hence, the lady in green naturally held a grudge against Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry. I will take revenge on your behalf. At the same time, I will vent my anger too,” Lin Tianhao said.

“Mm. With Brother Tianhao taking action personally, this silly man could only be on the defensive,” the lady in green nodded. She had absolute confidence in Lin Tianhao.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang and Lin Tianhao appeared on the spacious battlefield. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hey, it’s you again,” Jian Wushuang crossed his arms before his chest. He was still casual in his manner.

“Humph. I didn’t get to fight a hearty battle with you in the bar. Today, we have to call victory and defeat between us,” Lin Tianhao glared coldly.

“Alright, alright. Come and hit me. Save your bullshit,” Jian Wushuang dug his ear as he said arrogantly.

“You are courting death,” Lin Tianhao was angry. His hands became crimson red in an instant, just like two volcanoes.

As he slapped, there was a significant amount of flames spreading to the surrounding. The entire battlefield was a sea of fire.

Back in the bar, regardless of if it were Lin Tianhao or Jian Wushuang, both intentionally controlled their strength and power so that it didn’t spread. Hence, the movement in the bar wasn’t great. However, both of them held no scruples then.

Looking at Lin Tianhao’s palm, Jian Wushuang smirked and then punched with his crimson fists too.

The volcano-like palms collided with Jian Wushuang’s fists and there were continuous ferocious clashes.

Both parties exchanged blows and the competition was immediately white-hot.

One should know that the strength and divine body that Jian Wushuang had put on display was powerful. As such, the cultivators in the ranking competition avoided fighting head-on with him. Only Lin Tianhao alone was fearless. He was the first who had the courage to fight Jian Wushuang head-on and he didn’t have the lower hand.

“Haha, boy, I belittled you. You are quite powerful, huh?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Humph, you are not too shabby. It is definite that you could enter Imperial Peak. However, it is a pity that you offended me earlier. I have to teach you a lesson,” Lin Tianhao sounded cold. Just as he had said, there was suddenly a layer of crimson armor that surfaced from his body. The crimson armor was like magma in a volcano, the temperature was terrifyingly high.

Then, his figure grew by one size too. He was three meters tall and his aura naturally grew tremendously too.

“Secret Skill of Golden Flame, Burn The Mountain!”

Hong!

Lin Tianhai slapped. His slap was like a huge aerolite surrounded with boundless flames that descended directly.

The strength of the power had absolutely already reached middle stage Chaotic Realm, the level of Emperor God.

“This boy is really not too shabby.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised but he performed King of Beast’s Divine Punch again to resist.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and Jian Wushuang took a few steps back from the impact. The surrounding void was still burning in the flames.

“Humph, you should be proud that you were able to resist this move. But the next one…” Lin Tianhao’s gaze turned cold.

“Secret Skill of Golden Flame, Burn The Earth!”

Hong!

Similarly, he slapped. It was double the power of the earlier palm.

“Again?”

Jian Wushuang looked shocked. Then, he retreated without hesitation. He even exited the battlefield to join the surrounding spectators.

“Forget it. I am already in the top five and I can enter Imperial Peak. It is not necessary to fight a life and death battle with you. You win this battle,” Jian Wushuang waved and acted generous.

The surrounding spectators looked at him in disdain when they saw the scene.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang had quit because he wasn’t Lin Tianhao’s match and he wasn’t confident that he could win against Lin Tianhao. That was the true reason why he had opted to quit, not what he had said it to be.

He was extremely shameless.

Lin Tianhao was angry about his action but he had no choice. Jian Wushuang admitted defeat and retreated to outside of the battlefield. He couldn’t just continue to chase after him.

But in actual fact, no one knew that Jian Wushuang wasn’t shameless but the truth was just as he had said.

His intention was only to enter Imperial Peak. He could already enter so he naturally didn’t need to fight with Lin Tianhao further.

On top of that, the character that he was disguised as, Ah Shou, had put his power on display appropriately. If he were to defeat Lin Tianhao with more skills, he would outsmart himself. Hence, he might as well give up the battle.

After another few battles, the ranking competition ended.

The top five strongest contestants were chosen. The strongest among the five was Lin Tianhao from Lin Family in Prefecture Tong.

Jian Wushuang, disguised as Ah Shou, was one of the five as well.

The five of them were qualified to cultivate in Imperial Peak.

“The five of you, be prepared. I will take you to Imperial Peak now,” the elder who hosted the ranking competition said.

The five of them looked excited.

“Haha, Imperial Peak, I heard of Three-Emperors World’s cultivation sanctuary long ago. I wonder what it looks like?” Jian Wushuang laughed casually.

“Such an inexperienced bumpkin,” Lin Tianhao glared at Jian Wushuang in disdain.

“Yo, Mister Lin from Lin Family, Mister Genius Lin, you are so amazing but you are entering Imperial Peak for the first time just like us!” Jian Wushuang mocked him.
