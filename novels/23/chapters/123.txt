Chapter 124: The Sword Tomb

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Is it the effect of that Heart-recovering Pill?”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He also heard in the vague conversation, that the woman said to make him take a Heart-recovering Pill.

After figuring everything out, Jian Wushuang forcefully bore the remaining pain and stood up, examining his surroundings.

“What’s this?”

After seeing the surroundings, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

There were some dilapidated stone tablets standing in a boundless wasteland. But, at a glance, numerous thickly dotted sword scars could be seen on the ground.

Yes, they were sword scars.

They were deliberately left by experts in Sword Principle.

Thickly dotted, thousands of sword scars.

Jian Wushuang randomly looked at the sword scar beside him. But with this glance, he was attracted by it immediately.

It was incomparably violent and swift, containing a strong Sword Essence of Raging Fire, which made Jian Wushuang feel shocked.

“It’s so strong. The man who left this sword scar had a strong and terrifying comprehension in Sword Essence of Raging Fire. The owner of this sword scar can definitely pass the 13th level of the Dragon Gate,” Jian Wushuang said in a surprise.

He also grasped the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. So when seeing this sword scar, which contained a vast Sword Essence of Raging Fire, he could infer how powerful the expert who left the sword scar was.

Jian Wushuang turned to look at another sword scar beside him.

“Earth, everything contained in one stroke?”

“This Sword Essence of Earth is so awesome!”

Jian Wushuang was totally stunned again.

The Sword Essence of Raging Fire and the Sword Essence of Earth contained in two sword scars that were surprisingly strong.

But these two sword scars were the most common and inconspicuous ones among the thousands of sword scars in this open space.

Jian Wushuang raised his head and subconsciously?looked again at the stone tablets standing in front of him.

In the wasteland, there were six dilapidated stone tablets standing there.?Each stone tablet had a?large and clear sword scar in?the middle.?But these six sword scars were far more powerful than the others that were on the ground of the wasteland.

Jian Wushuang looked at the sword scar on one of the dilapidated stone tablets at once.

“This, this...” Jian Wushuang was shocked by the stone tablet right in front of him.

It was quite common and dilapidated.

In the middle of the stone tablet, was a huge sword scar that was a full three meters long.

“Too, too...” Jian Wushuang looked at the?huge sword scar crosscut in the middle of the stone tablet. He could even imagine that a long time ago, someone who had incredible power crosscut from it randomly with his sword drawn from the sheath.

The sword scar was left on the stone... but the stone tablet was intact. How exquisite?was the power he mastered?

“Sword Essence of Earth! This sword scar actually contains everything I can imagine about the Sword Essence of Earth. Mysteriousness, profoundness, vast and boundlessness, even inclusion. Everything is included in it.”

“Sword Essence of Gale! Tear, puncture, and mistiness. Everything is also in it.”

“Sword Essence of Raging Fire!”

“Sword Essence of the Waterdrop!”

Jian Wushuang was totally shocked.

In his view, this sword completely contained all the mysteriousness of four sword essences. More importantly, the four sword essences were perfectly combined.

Four sword essences... combined perfectly!

Jian Wushuang was totally obsessed. It was so amazing. Such?swordsmanship was beyond his imagination.

In his obsession, he could not help taking out his Triple-kill Sword and practicing his swordsmanship spontaneously. His thoughts and consciousness became immersed in the sword scar more deeply.

“Stop, stop it!”

Jian Wushuang shouted suddenly. Meanwhile, it was not until Jian Wushuang bit his lip and started bleeding that he was able to free himself from the obsession.

“How dangerous! How dangerous!”

Jian Wushuang bent his waist and placed his hands on his knees, breathing heavily. Cold sweat was running all over his body.

“Nearly, I was nearly bewitched.” Jian Wushuang raised his head, looking at the stone tablets right in front of him again. However, he dared not meditate on those sword scars thoughtlessly anymore.

Too strong.

The few sword scars on the stone tablets were too profound and insolent. He was not qualified to meditate on them at all with his present comprehension of sword essence.

If he meditated forcibly like that, he would be completely bewitched and become lost in it. Finally, he would lose his sword essence as well as his true intention.

It was madness!

“The sword essence on the stone tablets is too esoteric and terrifying. If I meditate now, it is no different than killing myself.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. Then, after a while, he recovered completely from the nearly mad situation.

After taking a deep breath, he examined the area again.

“This, is the Sword Tomb?” Jian Wushuang was full of astonishment from the bottom of his heart.

So amazing!

Thousands of sword scars. Each was left by a supreme expert of true Sword Principle.

The apprehension of the sword essence contained in each sword scar was extremely profound.

Each sword scar was profound enough for him to become immersed in studying it for a long time.

After being startled, Jian Wushuang felt a burst of ecstasy.

“This sword essence contains the Sword Essence of the Waterdrop...”

“This contains both Sword Essences of Raging Fire and Earth. It perfectly combines these two sword essences.”

“This sword scar... is arbitrary and fierce. What kind of sword essence does it contain? It does not feel like that of earth, fire, water or wind. But doesn’t the power seem to be stronger?”

Jian Wushuang stood beside these sword essences. He could not stop himself from taking out his Triple-kill Sword and practicing sometimes, losing himself in it. In Jian Wushuang’s view, these sword scars in front of him... were even more precious than the three treasure places in Dragon Palace.

It was indeed the most desirable place for warriors of Sword Principle to cultivate.

However, as Jian Wushuang was completely obsessed in meditating on these sword scars, two figures were Voidwalking and hovered above the nearby vast void of the Sword Tomb. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of these two people, one was an absolute beauty with snow-white skin and a cold expression, while the other was a burly man with a simple and honest look.

“Hum, this guy was lucky enough to survive by taking the Heart-recovering Pill,” the absolute beauty coldly said.

“Lady, although this little guy is at a low realm, his talent is pretty good. He has already completely awakened the Sword Soul at such young age.” The honest and burly man smiled.

“Well. That’s just for the present. If it was...” The absolute beauty’s voice ceased and she didn’t continue speaking. Instead, she turned to the burly man and said, “Have you arranged the Sword Tomb guards already?”

“Yes. Everything is arranged according to your orders,” the burly man answered.

“Well,” said the absolute beauty. She nodded her head and looked down. “Hum, this guy really takes this Sword Tomb as a valuable opportunity. But he doesn’t realize that opportunity appears along with crisis. One month later, when the Sword Guard appears, he will be tortured.”

“I hope he can survive the Sword Tomb guards.”
