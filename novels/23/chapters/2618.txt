Chapter 2619: Infernal Crimson

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement after hearing that.

Although the top factions in Danyang Holy Realm occasionally competed against each other, things had not truly turned ugly between them.

Although Nanwu Palace had sacrificed a few Heaven Ultimate Gods in return for the Huangji Golden Pill, they were willing to accept such a fate. However, matters might be different if Nanwu Palace lost one of their Grand Ultimate Gods or the Young Palace Master as that might lead to tensions between the top factions.

Crimson Stone Fort would be the one reaping benefits if that happened.

“I’m here to buy a sword-type divine weapon that must be suitable for Transmigration Law,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Master, you want it for the Transmigration Sword Formation, right?” The Black Chief peered at Jian Wushuang.

“You’re right. It’s for the Transmigration Sword Formation,” admitted Jian Wushuang.

No one else knew Jian Wushuang had bagged the Transmigration Sword Formation besides the Black Chief as he was the one who served Jian Wushuang. He would never release the news to the public due to Star Picking Pavilion’s strict customers’ privacy policy.

Any Star Picking Pavilion’s chiefs arbitrarily disclosed their customers’ information to the public or pulled any tricks when trading with customers would be executed once convicted with no room for struggles or sophistry.

The Black Chief said, “There are several types of swords in the Star Picking Pavilion that are suitable for the Transmigration Sword Formation with varying strength. The most powerful one among them is the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword. Are you interested?”

“Let me have a look,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Black Chief soon unsheathed a black longsword and showed it to Jian Wushuang.

The black longsword was less than three feet long with an extremely thin and sharp blade. The blade was smooth and plain without any mysterious patterns or carvings. However, there was a bloodstain line running through the entire sword from the blade’s center which made the sword seem extremely cold and eerie.

The black longsword was enshrouded in a thick Transmigration Strength.

The Infernal Crimson Divine Sword was murderous!

“Good sword.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as he could resonate with the Transmigration Strength carried by the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword while stroking it.

He was certain that his power would be boosted if he used the sword to perform the Transmigration Sword Technique. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“This sword is good, but it’s only a top-tier Earthly Treasure. Is there something at a higher level?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The divine weapons usually came in different grade sets.

The Black Chief explained, “We do have a Heavenly Treasure level Infernal Crimson Divine Sword. However, you must be able to control all nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords at once if you’re using it for the Transmigration Sword Formation. It takes a lot of divine power to control even one Heavenly Treasure level divine weapon. Won’t it be too taxing on you if you try to control all nine of them at once?”

He placed himself in Jian Wushuang’s shoes when recommending top-tier Earthly Treasure level Infernal Crimson Divine Sword.

“I have my methods regarding the divine power controls. Show me the Heavenly Treasure level Infernal Crimson Divine Sword,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Black Chief did not say much as an Infernal Crimson Divine Sword that was the same as before appeared in front of Jian Wushuang the moment he waved his hand.

Although there were no changes in appearances and Transmigration Strength permeated on the blade’s surface, the Heavenly Treasure sword possessed a much stronger aura than its top-tier Earthly Treasure counterpart—giving off a much colder and fiercer aura.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up at the sight of the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword.

“How many Primordial Stones does this Infernal Crimson Divine Sword cost?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, this Infernal Crimson Divine Sword is a graded divine weapon. Although it’s only an ordinary Heavenly Treasure divine weapon, it’s the most powerful among its Heavenly Treasure peers, hence it’s a much steeper price at two and a half million Primordial Stones. You’ll only need to pay twenty-two and a half million Primordial Stones if you buy all nine swords together,” said the Black Chief.

“It’s really expensive,” said Jian Wushuang.

The pitch-black spear which he previously auctioned at the Star Picking Pavilion was a top-tier Heavenly Treasure Offensive Divine Weapon, but it was only sold for 2,050,000 Primordial Stones—much lower than the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword.

“Although it’s expensive, it’s worth the price.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately took out an Interspatial Ring. “Here you go, twenty-two million five hundred thousand Primordial Stones. Have a look.”

Black Chief took the Interspatial Ring and nodded after briefly scanning its contents. “Master, wait a minute.”

Not long after, the Black Chief appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again and gave all nine Heavenly Treasure Infernal Crimson Divine Swords to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was quite happy.

His combat prowess would be greatly improved with those nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords when performing the Transmigration Sword Formation. The Transmigration Sword Formation’s current power was enough to wipe out a Peak Earth Ultimate God. Its power might even be able to compete against Heaven Ultimate Gods if he went all out to perform the Transmigration Sword Formation!

Jian Wushuang cried out again, “There’s another matter. I have a lot of Primordial Stones, but they are of little use to me. Can I exchange these Primordial Stones with some Divine Elixir Pills?”

“Divine Elixir Pills?” The Black Chief was startled before bitterly smiled. “Master, you must be joking. It’s impossible to exchange Primordial Stones for Divine Elixir Pills.”

“Impossible?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Yes, although the market value of a Divine Elixir Pill is about five million Primordial Stones, it doesn’t mean the two can be traded freely. Divine Elixir Pills are completely different from Primordial Stones after all. The Divine Elixir Pills are for high-level cultivation so they are far better than Primordial Stones. Many various factions and powerful experts regard the Divine Elixir Pills as far more important than Primordial Stones.”

The Black Chief continued, “If you’d like to exchange a Divine Elixir Pill for Primordial Stones, you may get five million Primordial Stones from the Star Picking Pavilion and we might even agree to the exchange for six million Primordial Stones. However, we won’t be able to do the reverse. The deal will happen even if you paid six, seven, or even ten million Primordial Stones.

“It’s not just us. I believe that many factions won’t be willing to do the same. However, you may be able to use other special treasures like the Soul Offensive Divine Weapon which you have previously auctioned in exchange for Divine Elixir Pills.”
