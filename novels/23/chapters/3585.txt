Chapter 3586: The Target of Public Criticism

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

If he knew that someone else had such an experience, he would definitely believe that he had obtained a great opportunity.

“My young friend, there is one more thing you should understand. For those experts who have been wandering in the three battlefields all year round, treasures are not the most attractive to them. What really makes them ecstatic are some special great opportunities.”

“Therefore, after you are certain that you have obtained a great opportunity over the years, you are bound to become a target for everyone. Countless experts will be eyeing you. It’s not surprising that many experts have already headed in your direction. They are all here for your opportunities. Moreover, among those experts who are eyeing you, there are some top experts who have reached the pinnacle of the six realm. There might even be experts at the Ruler Realm eyeing you,” Axe One Master said seriously.

“Ruler?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

For the current him, even Elder Dark Bone, an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm who had lived for God knows how many years, could not pose any threat to him. As for the other Principles Masters, no matter how many they came, he would not care.

But he had to be afraid of the Ruler Realm experts.

After all, he could not confront the Ruler head-on at the moment.

“In that case, I’m really in big trouble now,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“It’s not just big trouble. You’re in the middle of a crisis. If you’re not careful, you might be killed. So you must be extra careful now. Try to hide yourself or find a place to hide first. I’ll immediately report this to the Palace Master and see what he thinks,” Axe One Master said.

“I’ll be careful, but I won’t go so far as to hide.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

It was not because he was too arrogant, but because he knew his current strength and means.

Although he had become the target of public criticism, he had to be careful. However, it was not necessary for him to hide.

After all, only a Master Realm expert could threaten him. There were not many Master Realm experts, so he did not know whether a master would target him or not. Even if a master did target him…the depths of Devil Smoke Valley were so big, so it would not be easy for the Ruler to meet him?

Of course, the most important thing was that Jian Wushuang was not afraid of a Ruler. However, if a Ruler appeared in front of him and attacked him, he was not afraid because he felt that…a single Ruler would not be able to kill him.

“Anyway, I’ve already told you. You make your own decision. I’ll send a message to Palace Master first,” Axe One Master said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After the message was cut off, Axe One Master could not help but sigh.

“How is it?” Marquis Duan Yu, Star Saint Master, and Seven Emotions Master looked over.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you’re still alive. The news that was spread earlier is also true. He walked out of the Life and Death Realm,” Axe One Master said.

“That’s great.” Marquis Duan Yu was overjoyed.

“He disappeared from the undiscovered region for nearly 100,000 years and is still alive. Furthermore, he walked out from the Life and Death Realm in the end. This Heavenly Sword Marquis really has some ability.” Seven Emotions Master could not help but praise.

“It’s not too early to be happy. After all, Heavenly Sword Marquis is currently in a bad situation.’ on google’? He has already become the target of everyone. I have to report this matter to the Palace Master immediately and let him decide.” Axe One Master said.

“Yes, Palace Master is very powerful. He must have a way to help Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Marquis Duan Yu nodded.

Axe One Master immediately set off to meet Star Palace Master.

On the other side, after Jian Wushuang had finished talking with Axe One Master and received the exact news from him, his expression became serious.

“Death Slayer is really good. He spread the news and made me the target of everyone. If I’m not careful, I might die. This way, he can avenge the Gray Python Master.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, at the same time, there are some regrets. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If he had known that the Death Slayer Master would bring him so much trouble after he escaped, then when he had been attacked by the Death Slayer Master and the Gray Python Master, he should have killed both of them at the same time.

If he had killed the Death Slayer Master at the same time, this trouble would naturally have been gone. Unfortunately, his strength had just soared, and because he had the Blood Demon Cave Armor on him, he wanted to test the protective ability of the Blood Demon Cave Armor himself, so he did not use his full strength at the beginning. This gave the Death Slayer Master a chance to escape.

Now, it was too late for him to kill the Death Slayer Master.

“Forget it. Although the Death Slayer Master has caused me a lot of trouble, I should be able to deal with him now,” Jian Wushuang muttered and then rushed toward the void in front of him.

...

Sacred Island!

In the Magnificent Palace.

“What did you say? Heavenly Sword Marquis is not dead?”

On the throne in front of him, the white-haired elder looked down at the Principles Master who was kneeling at the pinnacle of the six realm. A terrifying chill instantly rose in his heart.

The Principles Master, who was at the pinnacle of the six realm, was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat, however, he still forced himself to say, “My lord, the news has been confirmed. Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed not dead, and he has survived the Life and Death Realm. His strength has soared. Now, the experts of all the forces in the territory believe that he has obtained an incredible opportunity in the past 100,000 years. Many experts have already set their eyes on him.”

“Humph!”

The white-haired elder snorted and stood up. His eyes were cold and emotionless. “I don’t care if he got lucky or not, but the purpose of this trip is to kill him. Now that we know he is not dead, we must kill him immediately.”

“Tong Luo, Evil Light!”

The white-haired elder took out two communication tokens and sent them to them. “Heavenly Sword Marquis is not dead yet, and he should be near the Life and Death Realm in the core of Devil Smoke Valley. You two go and kill him immediately!”

Tong Luo and Evil Light were the other two Rulers who came with the white-haired elder.

The three of them came to this territory to kill Jian Wushuang, but because Jian Wushuang had disappeared in the unexplored area, everyone thought he was dead, so they relaxed, the white-haired elder continued to stay on the Sacred Island, but the other two went to the three battlefields.

Because Jian Wushuang had disappeared in Devil Smoke Valley, the two Master Realm experts also stayed in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley to play it safe.
