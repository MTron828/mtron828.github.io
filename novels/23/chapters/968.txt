Chapter 969: The Strongest Sword Principle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It’s high time for you to enhance your Ancient God Power now that you’ve reached the Three-Star level for Ancient God. These Chaos Gold Beads should help. Swallow one now and take a second one after you’ve fully absorbed the power of the first,” said King Gu.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He took a Chaos Gold Bead and swallowed it without hesitation.

The Chaos Gold Bead emitted numerous threads of clear, purified energy once it entered his system and he subsequently absorbed them all.

“This Chaos Gold Bead is sure helpful,” he said, smiling.

“The fourth treature that you might need is something concerning swordsmanship.” King Gu spoke again.

Jian Wushuang also turned his eyes to that treasure. It was an ancient jade slip that recorded an elite swordsman’s reflections.

He wouldn’t have been surprised if these were common reflections belonging to a Dao Master.

His expression changed when he saw that reflections were about swordsmanship.

“The strongest Sword Principle ?” Jian Wushuang blurted out in surprise.

The elite swordsman didn’t leave a name; instead, he left behind the most powerful Sword Principle!

“You’re really lucky. Though you’ve sacrificed a lot in the war and even wasted 90 percent of the inherited Essence Blood from King Luo Zhen, you still gained a lot.”

“Blood-killing Plate Armor, Spaceship from another realm, and Chaos Gold Beads… any one of these treasures would elicit the envy of the elites in the Eternal Chaotic World. Yet Dao Yuanzi’s Interspatial Ring even stored a record of an elite’s reflections on the most powerful swordsmanship…” King Gu exclaimed in admiration while cackling.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also filled with wild joy.

“The strongest Sword Principle…”

In Green Fire World, Sword Principles that Dao Masters developed and owned exclusively were usually divided into three classes: General Level, Universal Level, and Creation Level. Sword Principles of the third kind were rare and valuable.

The reason why Xia Mang was able to reach the top level amongst his Rank One peers after his advancement to a Dao Master was that he had developed a Creation Level principle.

However, Jian Wushuang had heard that there was an even higher level of Sword Principles beyond the Creation Level, which had reached the extremes of the universe. It was thus considered the strongest Sword Principles!

The Strongest Sword Principles were only described in sagas and legends in the Green Fire World. There had emerged numerous talents in the history in this world, but in the archives of time, no more than five had truly developed the Strongest Sword Principle.

That was how rare it was!

The only surviving elite who had developed the Strongest Sword Principle in the Green Fire World was Sunrise Sword Emperor—universally acknowledged to be the No. 1 Sword Cultivator!

Most people didn’t even know anything about these Sword Principles because it was too difficult to develop them.

However, Jian Wushuang had now obtained a record of reflections by an elite who had developed the Strongest Sword Principles!

This was a great gift of fortune for him.

“You might want to dig into the Strongest Sword Principle recorded in this jade slip and use the elite’s experience for reference, but bear in mind that imitation is strictly restricted,” King Gu warned solemnly.

“You must develop Sword Principles on your own for they’re always exclusive. It’s this exclusiveness that grants you the strongest power and helps you become a Dao Master. If you blindly comprehend and imitate someone else’s learnings, the Sword Principles you end up with won’t be of much help. It doesn’t matter even if you fully understood it. It’s useless as it doesn’t belong to you.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang made a small nod.

“Great. In fact, I’ve already found that the Sword Soul you’ve awakened was the strongest kind. It’ll later transform into a Sword Heart, which remains the strongest of its kind. Those with the strongest Sword Hearts would obtain the qualifications necessary to develop the Strongest Sword Principles.”

“It’ll be easy for you to develop principles of General or Universal Levels. With a little effort and opportunity, it won’t be a problem for you to create Sword Principles at the Creation Level either.”

“However, it’d be such a waste if you only develop Sword Principles at the Creation Level and use them to facilitate your advancement to a Dao Master, especially since you’ve obtained the strongest Sword Heart!”

“Principles could have an extraordinary impact on your future development.”

“Therefore, the more powerful your principles are, the better. The most powerful Sword Heart has already assured you an advantageous position from the beginning, but you still need to set a bottom line for yourself: you must develop at least one Strongest Sword Principle before becoming a Dao Master; as for the second or third principle, you’re free to choose a Sword Principle of the Creation Level,” said King Gu.

“At least one Strongest Sword Principle before becoming a Dao Master?” Jian Wushuang smiled before making a firm nod.

Those who possessed the strongest Sword Hearts would undoubtedly waste their talent if they didn’t strive for the most powerful Sword Principles.

“This jade slip has comprehensive records of one of the most powerful Sword Principles. I’ll take my time to study them later. For now, our most urgent task is returning to the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sharpened.

He had been staying here to rebuild his body for the past 1,200 years but he had learned of the events in the Kingdom Tang through Wang Yuan’s messages.

He was well aware of the current condition of the kingdom.

He was helpless in the past because his body had yet to recover but things were different now.

Thus, Jian Wushuang immediately left the cave mansion and headed for the land above.

He reappeared in the sky a while later and found an old man in a white robe standing in front of him.

Though the old man was an Eternal Realm expert, he couldn’t help trembling in fear in front of Jian Wushuang. He had no choice but to answer Jian Wushuang’s questions.

“Thanks for the information.” Jian Wushuang waved abstractedly and sent the old man away. He then took out the Star Map.

“I’m currently in the Floating Water region not far from Tang of the East. If I rush there, it’ll take me at most a month. Once there, I’d be able to reach the imperial palace in a moment through the tunnel.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. He then took out a messaging slip to send a message to Wang Yuan.

“Brother Wang Yuan, please inform Emperor Xiao that I’ve fully recovered and am currently heading for Tang. I should arrive outside the imperial palace in a month. Tell them to have a little more patience.”

“I’ll take my revenge once I’m back. I won’t let off any of my enemies, whoever they are, whether they’re the experts from the three big countries or elites from influential clans!”
