Chapter 683: Emperor Sword

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Master really thinks highly of me as he asks me, a Skyscraping Realm cultivator, to kill Divine Realm experts, including five advanced Divine Realm experts.”?Jian Wushuang sighed with emotions in private.

After all, there was a world of difference between beating someone and slaying them.

A Divine Realm expert, especially an advanced expert, often held one or two secret skills. Some of them were even capable of life-saving secret skills like Dragon Blood Secret Skill. Jian Wushuang might have the ability to defeat an advanced Divine Realm expert, but he didn’t hold much confidence in slaying one.

As though he already knew what Jian Wushuang was thinking, Xuan Yi spoke. “Rest assured, I personally selected this mission for you. The eleven Divine Realm experts all share the same skill in battle strength, none of them are very capable of life-saving skills. Given your strength, you can surely kill them.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang asked, his confidence now growing.

If they were unable to perform excellent life-saving techniques, it was possible that he could indeed kill them.

“This is the map of the territory which is under our Ancient Sect’s control. The eleven Divine Realm experts are within this territory. You can study the route yourself and you must kill them all in two months,” instructed Xuan Yi.

“Ok”. Jian Wushuang took the map and nodded his head.

“There is one more thing.” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang. “The sword you’re using now was brought by you from the Ancient World, correct? It can barely reach the Divine Weapon level, it is most suited to some novice or intermediate Divine Realm experts. It’s not very suitable for you.”

Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

The sword he used? Heart-killing Sword?

Indeed he had brought it from the Ancient World after acquiring from a Sword Ancestor.

“Divine Weapon?” Jian Wushuang queried.

Plenty of experts used Dao Weapons, but there was few Divine Weapons in the Ancient World. It was only thanks to a Sword Ancestor that Jian Wushuang was eligible to get a Divine Weapon. He had to this point been using the Heart-killing Sword effortlessly, but as he grew stronger, he found it was no longer capable of displaying his full strength.

“I have a sword for you. Take it.” Xuan Yi stretched out his hand in which appeared a purple longsword.

As soon as it showed up, an extremely strong Killing Intent of the sword spread at once, which instantly made Jian Wushuang understand that the purple longsword was also a Sword of Killing like his Heart-killing Sword, but its power was much stronger.

“Master, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang gazed upon this purple longsword. Its sword blade was thin and its sword edge was emitting an glowing cold light, making it appear very sharp.

“This is Emperor Sword, a magic weapon of Eternal Realm level.” Xuan Yi smiled casually as he spoke.

“Divine Weapon?” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

There was Dao Weapon, Divine Weapon and then Eternal Weapon!

Dao Weapons were most commonly used by Skyscraping Realm cultivators.

Divine Weapons were usually used by Divine Realm experts. Jian Wushuangs Heart-killing Sword only just reached the level of Divine Weapon, therefore it was suited to novice and intermediate Divine Realm experts. Advanced Divine Realm experts and superior Divine Realm experts used Divine Weapons with superior power.

Eternal Weapons on the other hand were used by Eternal Realm experts!

“This sword contains unusual power. Given your ability now, you cannot harness all of its power, but if you can access just a small amount of it, that will give you enough strength. I also want you to take this token. When on a difficult journey, you’ll inevitably encounter a crisis. If all else fails, you can crush this token and I’ll do my best to save you.” promised Xuan Yi.

“Thank you, Master.” Jian Wushuang spoke gratefully.

He knew in his heart that his master sincerely cared for him.

“That’s all. Set out as early as possible.” Xuan Yi waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and bowed respectfully to Xuan Yi before turning around to leave.

Jian Wushuang planned to return to Enlightenment Mountain first. On his journey back, he encountered many Ancient Sect disciples.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“That’s Jian Wushuang. He has not been seen for a long time.”

“I have been told that he has been staying in Sword Mountain for cultivation. Does he want to leave today?”

These disciples kept their distance, looking at Jian Wushuang from afar, their eyes full of awe.

Jian Wushuang also met two Palace Masters who happened to walk by. They were Palace Master Destruction, who was Feng’s Master, and Palace Master Baiyu who had once intended to accept Jian Wushuang as a personal disciple.

They watched Jian Wushuang in the distance.

“It’s Jian Wushuang. He has been staying in the Sword Mountain for cultivation and for the past six years has not shown his strength, I wonder how strong he is now,” Palace Master Baiyu said with admiration.

“I have heard that Palace Master Xuan Yi had just gotten a mission at the Divine Palace and it’s an Earth-level Task. It seems Jian Wushuang has been tasked with this mission,” Palace Master Destruction observed.

“Earth-level Task? Are they not reserved for advanced Divine Realm experts?” Palace Master Baiyu looked perplexed.

“No?” Claimed the Palace Master Destruction as a bitter smile stretched across his face. He himself also had accepted a favorite disciple to his sect, Feng, who he knew was much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

“This lad really is a beast.” Palace Master Baiyu softly shook his head. At that moment, he caught sight of the purple longsword on Jian Wushuang’s back.

“Huh?” The expression on Palace Master Baiyu’s face suddenly froze.

“What’s the matter, Baiyu?” Palace Master Destruction looked at him with confusion.

“Palace Master Destruction, look closely, is that the Emperor Sword strapped to his back?” Palace Master Baiyu Yu spoke, his tone displaying a hint of shock.

“Emperor Sword?” Palace Master Destruction was left dumbfounded as he saw Jian Wushuang carrying the purple longsword.

Seeing this, the expression on Palace Master Destruction’s face tightened.

“Good lord, Palace Master Xuan Yi actually gave him the Emperor Sword. It is clear that he holds Jian Wushuang in high regard!” Palace Master Destruction explained.

“The Emperor Sword isn’t just an Eternal Weapon. Most importantly, it is Sword Palace’s token, representing the successor of the Sword Palace!”

Palace Master Baiyu’s eyes gleamed.

Soon after Jian Wushuang returned to Enlightenment Mountain, he took time to pack some things, ready to leave the Ancient Sect to complete the Earth-level Task.

In front of a giant wormhole in the Ancient Sect, Jian Wushuang held the territory map from Xuan Yi in his hand and carefully studied it.

“The territory under the control of the Ancient Sect is extremely vast, and the eleven Divine Realm experts that I need to kill are scattered across the territory. It will be difficult to kill them one by one. The first place I’m going is, here!”

He looked at a city on the map—Dan Yang City.
