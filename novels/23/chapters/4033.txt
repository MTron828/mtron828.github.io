Chapter 4034: The Genius Banquet

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the day of the banquet, the Universal Poison Demon Sect opened its doors. Countless cultivators swarmed over, and it was extremely lively.

Most of these cultivators were there to watch the show. However, as long as they came, the Universal Poison Demon Sect would receive them well. They weren’t worried at all that someone would come and cause trouble.

After all, this grand banquet was not just held within the Universal Poison Demon Sect. It was mainly because the Thunder Star World’s once-in-a-million-year genius banquet had been personally ordered by the star lord.

Anyone who dared to cause trouble during the banquet would be disrespectful to the star Lord. However, the star lord of the Thunder Star World was a fifth level Ruler. In the Thunder Star World, his words were absolute, no one dared to disobey him.

The vast martial arts practice field could accommodate millions of people at the same time. In the center of the martial arts practice field, there was a huge void, which was used as a battlefield.

Many geniuses who participated in the genius feast would head to the battlefield to compete and determine the strongest. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At this moment, there were tens of thousands of people gathered in the martial arts practice field.

These tens of thousands of people were not ordinary people. The weakest among them was the Principles Master, and there were many Rulers.

This was the difference between a level two astral world in a medium-sized starfield and a level two astral world in a barren region at the edge of the universe.

For example, on Devil Cloud Planet, the strongest Ruler, Devil Cloud Planet Ruler, had just broken through to level four Ruler, while Devil Cloud Planet only had over a hundred Rulers under it.

However, the most powerful Ruler in the Thunder Star World was a fifth-level Ruler, and he had many fourth-level Rulers under his command. There were at least thousands of ordinary Rulers in the Thunder Star World!

“So many people have come to attend this banquet.”

Jian Wushuang stood in a corner with his arms crossed. Leng Rushuang, who was beside him, was wearing a light veil bamboo hat and had restrained her aura.

After the incident in the restaurant, Leng Rushuang realized that she was too similar to Leng Ruxue. If she did not disguise herself, it would be easy for people to mistake her and cause unnecessary trouble.

Therefore, before she came to the feast, Leng Rushuang deliberately covered her face with the bamboo hat.

Devil Flame was still standing respectfully behind Jian Wushuang.

Soon, the genius feast was held.

Although the genius feast said that geniuses from all forces in the Thunder Star World could participate, in fact, only geniuses from the three top forces could make a name for themselves in the genius feast.

Without a doubt, the witch from the Universal Poison Demon Sect was the most dazzling.

“Leng Ruxue.”

Jian Wushuang stood there with a cold gaze, staring at a peerless beauty who was fighting on the battlefield.

The peerless beauty was very similar to Leng Rushuang, not only in appearance, but also in temperament and soul aura.

Naturally, this peerless beauty was Leng Ruxue.

After many years, Jian Wushuang met Leng Ruxue again. She was the number one genius of the Universal Poison Demon Sect, and even the most dazzling existence among the younger generation in the Thunder Star World. and at this genius feast…her performance was indeed dazzling.

She held a cyan-colored long spear in her hand. With a casual thrust of the long spear, she easily defeated the top geniuses from various forces.

Even the genius disciples from the other two top forces, who had battle strength comparable to a third-level Ruler, could not last long in Leng Ruxue’s hands and were easily defeated by her.

The spectators could see that Leng Ruxue had not used her full strength.

“That’s right. After more than 200,000 years, Leng Ruxue has made great progress. Her comprehension of the origin of the spear principle universe is very high, and she is even comparable to a fourth-level Ruler. With her ability to steal food and her divine power, which is obviously much stronger than that of a second-level Ruler, she can easily defeat all the geniuses at the Genius Feast. However, she hasn’t used her most powerful body of woeful poison. I heard that she has Rulered the first secret skill of the Universal Poison Demon Sect, the universal poison scripture, but she hasn’t used it yet.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Beside Jian Wushuang, although Leng Rushuang’s face was hidden under the bamboo hat, her eyes were fixed on Leng Ruxue in the middle of the battlefield. She looked calm.

Time passed slowly.

The genius feast lasted for three days and three nights in the drill ground.

On the fourth day, the genius feast came to an end.

Now, there was only one battle left in the genius feast. One of them was Leng Ruxue, and the other was the number one genius from a top force.

In terms of combat strength, that genius was stronger than an ordinary third-level Ruler, but it was obvious that he was much weaker than Leng Ruxue.

When the battle began, this genius did not intend to defeat Leng Ruxue. Instead, he wanted to force Leng Ruxue to use her special constitution or use the Ten Thousand Poison Scripture, unfortunately, he did not succeed in the end.

In this battle, Leng Ruxue displayed her extremely terrifying spear technique. This spear technique was far stronger than those third-level Rulers who were proficient in the spear path. In the end, she easily defeated that genius.

From then on, the competition of this genius feast had truly come to an end.

“Haha, as expected of the number one super genius in the history of the Universal Poison Demon Sect. Her strength is indeed impressive.”

“Unfortunately, I had specially rushed over this time. I had wanted to take a good look at her woeful poison body, but I didn’t expect that she didn’t use her constitution at all.”

“She is clearly a second-level Ruler, but in terms of battle strength, she is probably comparable to a peak third-level Ruler. If she were to use her constitution to use the Ten Thousand Poison Scripture, there would probably be very few third-level Rulers who could defeat her.”

“This witch’s talent is definitely the best in our thunder star sector for billions of years. Even in the entire Purple Micro Galaxy, she can probably rank in the top three.”

After the final competition ended, the experts from various sects and factions who stood in the void at the very top began to discuss. Naturally, this included the people from the three top factions.

On the martial arts practice field, the tens of thousands of cultivators watching the battle were also discussing.

Most of them were praising how powerful Leng Ruxue was.

In the corner of the martial arts practice field, Jian Wushuang glanced at Leng Rushuang and said, “The battle of the genius feast is over. Now, Shuang ‘er, it’s your turn.”

“Well, I’m ready,” Leng Rushuang said softly.

“I’ll open the way for you.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and then moved.
