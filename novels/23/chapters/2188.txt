Chapter 2189 Nine Province Seal!

Boom~~~ The majestic continent descended.The majestic continent covered too big an area and the suppressing power was incredible. Blood Emperor was located at the centre of this majestic continent and had nowhere to run.

He could only fight it head on!

“Humph!”

Blood Emperor grunted as he turned gloomy. “The Mountain River Map is an incredible treasure. However, its true power can only be used by a real expert. As for you… You can only cast the weakest skill for this Mountain River Map, the Nine Province Seal. Furthermore, you cant even cast the complete Nine Province Seal.”

“You can never kill me with just this power.”

Blood Emperor pointed his spear towards the incoming continent.

A crimson-red light appeared the moment he pointed his spear.

This crimson light looked like it could destroy everything in this world as it charged into the incoming continent. The bottom of the continent was penetrated instantly as it crumbled into pieces and dispersed in all directions.

Seeing this, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were shocked.

“How is this possible?”

“He stopped such a powerful attack so easily?”

“The Blood Emperor is far too strong!”

The experts exclaimed in surprise.

At the centre of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang remained indifferent.

“Compared to before, this forth seal is much much stronger now. However, it is impossible for this to kill the Blood Emperor,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He knew that the fourth seal, Seal of Clouds, could not harm the Blood Emperor. He had cast it to test how powerful his Nine Province Seal was.

What followed was the real deal.

Boom~~~ Limitless amounts of divine power boiled.

Jian Wushuang started to make various hand signs.

Another majestic province descended from the Picture Scroll World.

The aura was even stronger and terrifying.

This was the fifth seal of the Nine Province Seal.

“What a joke!” The Blood Emperor roared, not afraid. A limitless amount of blood qi started to boil as the Boundless Sea of Blood appeared again.

The Sea of Blood was endless.

Blood Emperor was at the centre of the Sea of Blood. Large amounts of blood gathered to form a gigantic exotic beast.

This exotic beast looked like it was invincible.

The moment the beast was formed, a deafening roar was heard from the sea of blood and reverberated throughout the battlefield.

The soundwave swept out in all directions.

Many of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World covered their ears even though they were far away from the battlefield. Those who reacted slower experienced bleeding from their eardrums.

Those experts who were on this battlefield were at least in the Chaotic Realm.

After the roar, the exotic beast raised its hands up high.

The majestic province was held up and could not descend further.

The fifth seal dissipated after the power was used up.

“Even the fifth seal cannot hurt him?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself as he squinted his eyes.

He could not cast the fifth seal with his own power.

Now, he had the Secret Skills of Star Palace active, which enabled him to cast this seal.

He never thought that the Blood Emperor could stop this attack so easily.

“Next up…” Jian Wushuang made more unique hand signs.

His divine power and star power were absorbed by the Picture Scroll World at an insane rate.

WIthin moments, the sixth seal of the Nine Province Seal descended!

“The sixth seal?” Blood Emperor was taken aback.

The Mountain River Map was infamous for its several powerful skills.

Even though the Nine Province Seal was the most ordinary skill in the Mountain River Map, it was definitely powerful when it was used against experts in the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm. The Blood Emperor took this attack seriously.

“Come, come!”

The Blood Emperor roared madly. The sea of blood started to turn violent as dark crimson armour appeared. The same armour appeared on the gigantic exotic beast as well.

The exotic beast roared in anger.

This exotic beast raised its hands once again in an attempt to stop the sixth seal.

However, the sixth seal in the Nine Province Seal was at least five times as powerful as the fifth!

The exotic beast could stop the fifth seal, but the sixth seal…

Boom~~~ The crimson armour of the exotic beast turned dark and the blood qi started to escape from the body once the seal collided with the exotic beast.

Within moments, a loud boom was heard.

The gigantic Ancient Blood Beast crumbled under the pressure of the sixth seal.

The remaining power was headed straight for Blood Emperor.

Boom!

The earth was split apart and the entire Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds was destroyed. What was left was a humongous crater so deep that one could not see the bottom.

At the centre of the crater, a figure stood, battered.

This figure was the Blood Emperor.

At this moment, his clothes were ripped and wounds could be seen on his crimson skin. There were bloodstains around his mouth as well.

Even so, he was not angry. He smiled wantonly.

“Haha, not bad! The sixth seal!”

“Is that it?”

Blood Emperor sounded like he was crazy. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The surrounding experts fell silent when they saw this.

The sixth seal that Jian Wushuang had cast could only cause light injuries to Blood Emperor?

“To kill him, the power of the sixth seal is not enough. Unless he has the seventh seal…” Emperor Thirteen looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was slightly depressed.

He had to admit he had underestimated the fighting power of Blood Emperor and the techniques the experts from the ancient past had had.

Even though the Blood Emperor was not in prime condition and was only in the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm, it would not be easy to kill him.

The sixth seal did not manage to kill him.

As for the seventh seal…

The Mountain River Map had nine seals, representing nine states. Every three seals was a bottleneck as the next seal would be much more powerful and require much more divine power to cast.

Jian Wushuang could barely cast the sixth seal. As for the seventh Seal…

“Not enough, with the amount of divine power I have now, I cannot cast the seventh seal!”

Jian Wushuang roared. All nine Ancient God Stars crumbled in the next moment!

Boom! ~~

Boom! ~~

Boom! ~~

They crumbled one after another
