Chapter 418: The Bone King’s Invitation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I want to exchange my points for the first manual of?Triple?Shift?,” Jian Wushuang said.

The grey-clothed elder looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “4000 battle achievements. ”

Jian Wushuang took out a large number of enemies’ tokens. The grey-clothed elder counted them and nodded. He made a record on his paper and said, “Wait at the campsite. In three days, we’ll send it to you.”

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang said before leaving. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Three days later, a man sent the first manual of?Triple?Shift?to Jian Wushuang.

He immediately started to meditate on it.

Triple Shift,?as a first-grade manual and an extraordinary one, was naturally enigmatic.

It was different from Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt which Jian Wushuang had once cultivated. The latter had certain Origin comprehension requirements. At that time, Jian Wushuang had barely mastered it.

Triple Shift?did not require much of Origin but demanded a strong body.

Regardless of his depth of Origin comprehension, an ordinary expert would not be qualified to cultivate this manual if his body failed to meet the requirements.

This was the reason why Jian Wushuang valued the manual.

After he became a Venerable Master, his biggest advantage compared with ordinary experts of the Saint Realm was his strong body.

His body was as strong as a magic weapon and grew stronger the longer he stayed at this level. With the passing of time, his strength had increased by leaps and bounds.

It was obvious that his body met the requirements of practicing?Triple?Shift?. What he needed to do now was to meditate on the manual and practice it.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang stood quietly on a hill near the campsite. Suddenly, he moved.

CHUU!

Like a Flowing Light, he flashed through the Void. The movement was so fast it would have escaped the notice of ordinary Warriors.

Jian Wushuang’s residual shadow slowly dissipated. Before it completely disappeared, Jian Wushuang returned and his form solidified.

He traveled back and forth within a breath.

In the space of a single breath, he had traveled 10 miles away and returned.

Less than a breath!

“It’s so fast. It’s worthy of a first-grade manual,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted.

It was said that the first manual of?Triple?Shift?would allow one to travel 100 miles in a breath.

100 miles sounded like an exaggeration, but it was close to that.

If Jian Wushuang released the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt and transformed his body to lightning, it would take him at least four or five breaths to travel 10 miles and return. With Triple Shift, it only took him one breath.

“My speed has soared thanks to Triple Shift. Now I’m nearly as fast as Wind Demon,”Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

Wind Demon’s speed was impressive and highly regarded by all in the Inner Area.

Jian Wushuang acknowledged that he was still a little slower than Wind Demon under ordinary circumstances. However, if he superimposed the Road to the Underworld and Tenfold Realm to form the Blood River Realm to suppress Wind Demon, the latter would definitely be slower than him.

Jian Wushuang was sure that Wind Demon would not be able to escape in their next encounter.

Jian Wushuang returned to the campsite. As he entered his tent, someone approached him.

“Mr. Swordsman.” It was a black-robed old man, who was an ordinary expert at Pinnacle of the Saint Realm level and had not entered Stage Two.

“What’s up?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the old man, a little surprised.

Jian Wushuang had not been in Flaming Battlefield long and had been fighting alone. He knew some experts from the same camp but had no close friends in the Inner Area.

Except for the experts of Iron Saber Territory, he was not expecting any visitors.

“Mr. Swordsman, my master wants to meet you. I have come to invite you to his cave mansion,”?the old man said.

“Who is your master?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“My master is Bone King,” the old man laughed.

“Bone King?”Jian Wushuang was curious.

Flaming Battlefield was accessible only to experts.

Countless top experts gathered in the Inner Area, including plenty of experts at the Peak of Stage Three.

Among them, there were some formidable beings.

Those formidable beings, though also at the Peak of Stage Three, could fight with experts of Heaven-defying Level. Each was regarded as an overlord in the Inner Area, and no one dared to provoke them.

Average experts would flee if they met these overlords in the Inner Area.

Xue Luo, who Jian Wushuang had once met in the Inner Area, was one of them.

Xue Luo was much stronger than other experts at the Peak of Stage Three in terms of power and speed.

Bone King was a super expert who was even stronger than Xue Luo and he was notorious for killing.

In terms of battle strength, Bone King was invincible as long as he did not encounter the six experts of Heaven-defying Level, who rarely appeared.

“I’ve never met Bone King before. Why does he want to talk to me?”?Jian Wushuang looked puzzled.

Naturally, he would not refuse the invitation from a super expert.

“Where is your master now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Please come with me, ” the black-robe old man led the way forward.

The Bone King’s magnificent cave mansion stood in an immense rift not far from the campsite.

Jian Wushuang entered the cave mansion with the old man and soon saw Bone King.

“Haha, Swordsman.”

A barefoot middle-aged man in a loose robe smiled as he walked toward Jian Wushuang

“Bone King,” Jian Wushuang greeted him. A youth with a cold expression and sword-shaped eyebrows stood behind Bone King.

“Xue Yang,” Jian Wushuang also greeted him.

The young man nodded impassively.

Xue Yang was also an extraordinary expert at the Peak of Stage Three, though a little weaker than Bone King. Jian Wushuang had met Xue Yang in the Inner Area but had not fought him as they belonged to the same camp.
