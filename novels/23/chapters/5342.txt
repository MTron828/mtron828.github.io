After the Emperor’s trial, following careful scrutiny, participants were sent to the Azure Dragon Temple.

However, as the Azure Dragon Temple was currently not engaging in external battles, sending them there was futile. Instead, they were all dispatched to the Four Great Secret Realms.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This arrangement formed a closed loop, established by the Qishen Temple in ancient times.

It served the purpose of continuously selecting strong individuals, rekindling the glory of the Qishen lineage.

“Zhu San, go to the Black Tortoise Temple to receive the people. Zhu Si, go to the treasury and choose a flying treasure. Take them to the God’s Tomb and make sure to hand them over safely to the White Tiger Temple.”

She had heard about Jian Wushuangs incident. It was a significant loss and a warning.

The Four Great Secret Realms were no longer what they used to be. Internally corrupted, there was an underground force seeking to overthrow the Qishen Temple.

The inheritors were the future strong individuals of the Qishen Temple, and any mishap was unacceptable.

In the previous instance, it was only Jian Wushuang who entered one of the Four Great Secret Realms.

This time, it was 20,000 people. For those individuals, even being a billion Dao Lords made little difference, as they could be effortlessly extinguished.

Sending these inheritors required the use of powerful treasures.

Palace-type supreme Eternal Treasures were essential, much like the Eternal Tower, which allowed tier 4 Emperor participants to withstand attacks from tier 5 Emperors.

The supreme Eternal Treasures were crucial in thwarting attacks from peak-level experts.

A top-grade palace-type Eternal true treasure was a must.

Just like the Eternal Tower, a Tier 4 Emperor could withstand the attacks of a Tier 5 Emperor.

As for why she personally went to see them off, it was because she had more important matters to attend to.

She needed to establish the selection grounds for the next group of people. This time it was the Primitive Star, and the next time could be an ancient continent or a desolate starry sky. Anything was possible.

In the current hall, there were constantly inheritors arriving. Those who could come here were all inheritors.

Those who didn’t arrive had either fallen or had been gathered elsewhere, preparing to be transported out altogether.

The core of the Original Realm.

On a floating continent, there were a million trial participants.

Most of them retired after the ninth wave, and although many still had the strength of the Grand Yan Immortal at its limit, they didn’t qualify as inheritors.

“Your trials are over. You will all be transported to the Qishen Temple. Those who came from there can return there!”

The cold voice was like a bucket of cold water poured on them.

“I’m not willing. I’ve already reached the level of a half-step Dao Lord. Give me another chance! ”

Someone said unwillingly.

Some others with strong strength couldn’t help but speak up.

But that voice completely ignored them.

“If only I had known, I should have kept pushing back then.”

“l was so close! The eleventh wave was too difficult.’

There were regrets and there were indifferent remarks. Some Grand Yan Immortals, who were not top-tier fighters when they entered, had now transformed into limit-strong individuals.

They had also gained many precious treasures, even completing a set of Innate Treasures.

They had exchanged for supreme techniques and, after leaving, might not be weaker than others.

The most crucial factor was the Qishen Temple, which provided them with a set of insights into the Dao, similar to what the Emperors of the Great Si Region had received back then.

Their strength was no longer considered weak, especially the several experts at the second-grade origin source. After leaving, as long as they successfully integrated the Dao, reaching tier 3 was not difficult, and tier 4 was within reach.

In stark contrast to this were the inheritors inside the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Now gathered together, those who knew each other began sharing their situations. Many people engaged in lively conversations.

After all, they were no longer on the Original Planet, and there was no conflict among them. They had become very peaceful, with some individuals undergoing complete transformations in terms of strength, aura, and appearance,

Dao Lord Jiu Yan reached the grand hall, somewhat despondent. He failed in the nineteenth wave, lacking a bit of luck and ultimately losing.

After scanning the surroundings upon arrival, he didn’t spot anyone from the Tongtian Buddha realm.

“Where are Hu Qing and Brother Wushuang?”

Their strength was not to be underestimated; he had checked the rankings, and Hu Qings ranking was higher than his.

The ranking list still hung above the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Ranked first was a formidable figure named ‘Guang’, mastering the Ultimate Dao, with achievements ranking at the top.

He was the first to pass the 19th wave.

It was said that it took only a quarter of an hour.

The first position was well-deserved, and the Ultimate Dao he mastered, the Dao of Light, was extremely formidable—a powerful origin source comparable to the force of destruction.

Swish!

The ranking list quickly began to change.

Now, more than half a day had passed, approaching the crucial moment of victory or defeat.

“Hmm!”

Dao Lord Jiu Yan’s eyes narrowed as he saw Hu Qing’s ranking.

With a straight line above his body, he finally stopped at 19th place, followed by Wan Xing at 20th place.

Both of them successfully cleared the trials almost simultaneously.

After claiming their rewards, they entered the inner part of Qiuhuang City and teleported together to the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Ji Chaoyang was chattering incessantly along the way, but Hu Qing showed no sign of joy.

Their Original Planet was indeed special.

The three Ultimate Dao practitioners were all Nine Revolution Grand Yan Immortals. When he and Jian Wushuang first entered the Original Planet, they were not even top-tier Grand Yan Immortals. Their strength was very weak, but now 30 years had passed in the blink of an eye.

Their power had reached the level of Emperors, capable of even slaying tier 2 Emperors.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was no longer there.

If Ji Chaoyang could break through, he could also slay tier 2 Emperors. Unfortunately, breaking through was too difficult, not something achievable through mere cultivation.

Hu Qing had still not made a breakthrough.

On the other hand, Wan Xing had the most breakthroughs, almost every wave brought one.

In the 18th wave, he could barely hold on, but in the end, he broke through and made it through the final wave. In the last wave, he almost fell, but crucially, his aura grew stronger and stronger, reaching a point of endless flow, and he beheaded the Demon Lord.

Upon entering the Vermilion Bird Temple, Hu Qing saw the Dao Lord Jiu Yan, and the two approached to start a conversation.

Soon, all the Original Planets concluded.

Over 20,000 Dao Lords gathered here.

“Hu Qing, you’ve changed so much. Back in the Chishui Hall, you were just a

Six Revolution Grand Yan Immortal, and Brother Wushuang was only at the Three Revolution. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, you, little guy, have slain tier 2 Emperors,” Jiu Yan said, genuinely happy.

After all, among those present, Hu Qing was the only one truly belonging to their group.

In the vast universe with countless worlds, many worlds didn’t even have a single inheritor. Yet, in the Tongtian Buddha Realm, there were two, and from a medium-sized world at that. It was an extraordinary feat.

Hu Qing shook his head, sighing, “Unfortunately, Brother Wushuang is no longer here.”

“That’s right! If Brother Wushuang was still here, even if the four of us went to that Grave God Mountain, we would still be the overlords of a generation!” Although Ji Chaoyang was also a little sad, there was still a hint of optimism in his voice.

Dao Lord Si Tian stood alone in a corner, listening to Hu Qing and the others’ conversation. His eyes were shining.

Jian Wushuangs fall was, for him, a great blessing. He couldn’t wait to bring out the wine from the sack and share it with everyone.

Without the pressure of Jian Wushuang, he broke through all the way, reaching a level comparable to the Emperor. The future held boundless possibilities.

It’s just a pity about the Beast God Weapon; he wondered if it could still be retrieved.

But all of this is a story for another time..
