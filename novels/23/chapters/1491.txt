Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Lost, lost?”

“Seven Planet Palace Master, a Real God, lost?”

More than a million cultivators at the scene were dumbfounded by the outcome.

When Jian Wushuang defeated Ling Dan with one stroke, they were already astonished.

But then, Jian Wushuang had defeated a Real God directly, a true Real God!

“Top twenty!”

“Fighting power of a top twenty on Universe God ranking list!”

“Definitely do. Only experts in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list have the power to fight against a Real God face to face and be at an advantage, and even defeat a Real God!”

“This Jian Wushuang turns out to be a super genius that is qualified to be listed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list. He’s a superb expert!”

Everyone at the scene, there was a commotion stirred in the bottom of their heart.

Universe God ranking list was full of experts.

However, to be listed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list, every one of them were monstrous monsters!

Such a monster, they didn’t normally get a chance to witness. But then, the cultivators on the spot saw him and witness the battle of a rising monstrous expert!

They saw Jian Wushuang’s thundering manner and how he had defeated Ling Dan with their own eyes. They also witnessed how he had defeated the Real God expert, Seven Planet Palace Master.

They could only imagine Jian Wushuang’s name would definitely be famous all across Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and across the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

…

In the void, Jian Wushuang stood coldly and Blood Mountain Sword was sheathed in his scabbard.

His gaze was cold as he glanced at Seven Planet Palace Master from afar and said, “Seven Planet Palace Master, this is a lesson for you. If there is a next time… you’ll suffer Lineage of Star’s true rage. The dignity of Lineage of Star definitely isn’t something that anyone could provoke.

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated in the universe and didn’t disperse until much later.

Seven Planet Palace Master forcefully recovered the churning vital energy and blood in his body and stole a glance at Jian Wushuang. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Although he had lost to Jian Wushuang before everyone and he had been discredited, the incident came to an end regardless. At least, Lineage of Star wouldn’t find trouble with them in the future. Discrediting in exchange of Seven Planet Palace, in exchange for his life, Seven Planet Palace Master was grateful for Jian Wushuang.

Seven Planet Palace Master immediately bowed politely before Jian Wushuang to show his respect.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly at his action and didn’t bother with Seven Planet Palace Master, but walked towards Elder Qiu and Hu Feng.

“Elder Qiu, it has been done. I shall return,” Jian Wushuang stood before Elder Qiu.

“Mm,” Elder Qiu nodded, his gaze full of admiration.

Then, Jian Wushuang immediately left without giving a second look to the surrounding spectators.

At the end, Jian Wushuang took another look at Hu Feng.

Hu Feng was still in amazement. Until Jian Wushuang had walked far away, he finally came back to reality. He said in surprise, “Elder Qiu, Jian Wushuang… No, Senior Jian Wushuang, how can he be that strong?”

Lineage of Star, one speaks with his power.

They were both disciples of Star Palace. Jian Wushuang’s power was obviously not something he could compare to favorably. He naturally had to refer him as Senior Jian Wushuang.

“Strong? Why didn’t you look up to him earlier then? You even commented that he wasn’t your match. Why? Your attitude has changed entirely,” Elder Qiu said playfully.

“Elder Qiu, don’t tease me. How should I know? Senior Jian Wushuang broke through and became Universe God in the Third Heaven not too long ago. Plus, he isn’t famous at all but he is so strong. I reckon even Elder Qiu didn’t expect it yourself, right?” Hu Feng said.

Previously, he had really held Jian Wushuang in contempt.

However, he had his reasons. After all, Jian Wushuang really did have too short of a time for growth. Forget about him, among disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star, he reckoned not many would be bothered about Jian Wushuang’s power.

“That’s true,” Elder Qiu nodded. She admitted that although she believed in Hall Master Yuan’s arrangement, she was in doubt of Jian Wushuang’s power.

Until then, she had only understood when Jian Wushuang revealed his true power.

“Oh yeah. How’s Ling Dan? Is he dead?” Elder Qiu looked down into the ruin that Heavenly Fire Summit had become. Long Dan was still in the ruin, not knowing if he was alive or dead.

“Humph, he had the guts to provoke Lineage of Star, who cares if he’s alive or dead?” Hu Feng smirked coldly, “But Senior Jian Wushuang is really amazing. He defeated Hu Feng with one stroke and defeated a Real God head on – a true Real God!”

“If not mistaken, with Senior Jian Wushuang’s power, he is already qualified to be listed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list.”

Elder Qiu smiled and replied, “On Universe God ranking list, only geniuses in the top twenty are capable of defeating a Real God. When Jian Wushuang was fighting against Seven Planet Palace Master earlier, he was on the winning side the whole time. With such power, he definitely can be listed in the top twenty!”

“Vientiane Tower should receive the news very soon. Then, they’ll amend the ranking on Universe God ranking list.”

“This young man will also be well known in the universe!”

…

Fame was based on absolutely compelling battle achievements.

Just like four thousand years ago in the boundless void, when Jian Wushuang had met Zhao Han and they had had a vigorous fight.

Not many people saw the fight and the fight was too close to call.

Those who watched the battle couldn’t determine if Zhao Han had used all his power too. Hence, even if the news travel, no one could determine if Jian Wushuang possessed the fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list. Let alone putting Jian Wushuang on Universe God ranking list after the battle.

That was why Jian Wushuang still wasn’t famous after the battle.

However, it was different then.

Then, there were a million cultivators. Before a million pairs of eyes, Jian Wushuang defeated Ling Dan with one stroke and he was also on a winning streak and had defeated Seven Planet Palace Master who was a Real God.

Everyone approved of Jian Wushuang’s battle achievements and his power naturally could be determined.

Just as Elder Qiu had said, on the day Jian Wushuang defeated Seven Planet Palace Master, Vientiane Tower received the news and there were even images of the battle.

Vientiane Tower covered all manifestations of the universe. It held an extremely special position in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

The Universe God ranking list and Real God ranking list were created by Vientiane Tower.

Then, after they had obtained the image of Jian Wushuang in the battle, the higher ups in Vientiane Tower watched carefully and determined that Jian Wushuang really did possess the fighting power of one in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list.

Hence, very soon, a brand new Universe God ranking list appeared.

The brand new Universe God ranking list listed Jian Wushuang as the twentieth member! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Along with the announcement of the brand new Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang’s name spread across every single corner of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

Jian Wushuang became truly well known in the universe because of this!
