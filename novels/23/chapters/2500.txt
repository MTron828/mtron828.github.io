Chapter 2501: Life Armor Completed

“Master Jian, please be ready to feed the Life Armor some of your blood essences,” said Master Kun.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, Master Kun began his third attempt.

This time around, he had perfected the steps and made no mistakes.

Another ten days passed in a blink of an eye.

Master Kun who had been focusing on cultivating the Life Armor by the furnace had both his eyes lit up in excitement.

“The Life Armor is completed!”

Jian Wushuang looked over immediately. He could vaguely see a battle armor in the middle of the furnace within the hot liquid lava.

The Life Armor was just taking shape but yet to have its own wisdom.

Master Kun then took out the Purple Shimmer.

In his last two failures, he had not used the Purple Shimmer at all. He had only taken the Purple Shimmer out after the Life Armor took shape.

The Purple Shimmer was like a finishing touch to the Life Armor. The Life Armor seemed to have instantly come to life when Master Kun sent it into the furnace.

The Life Armor gave away a unique aura.

“This Life Armor has wisdom now. Master Jian, come here and let it absorb your blood essence,” said Master Kun.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and walked towards the furnace.

“How much blood essences are needed?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Generally, it takes a lot, but also depends on the blood essence’s ratings. Take your time, Master Jian. Just put in drop by drop and we’ll judge according to the situation,” said Master Kun. Jian Wushuang nodded. He stretched out his index finger and squeezed a drop of blood into the furnace.

The blood essence dripped into the furnace and was instantly swallowed by the hot liquid lava, but there were no changes in the furnace.

“A single drop of blood essence probably won’t give rise to any reaction. Master Jian, try dropping a few more drops.” Master Kun suggested.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

The higher the life rating, the harder it was to accumulate and extract their blood essence.

It was extremely difficult for people of the Ancient Race to accumulate and extract their blood essence. Jian Wushuang being a Perfect Chaotic Creature would naturally have a hard time accumulating and extracting his blood essence.

‘Try a few more drops?’

However, he only had a few drops of blood essence.

Just when Jian Wushuang was about to squeeze the second drop of blood essence...

Buzz!

The huge furnace suddenly shook and the hot liquid lava in the furnace began boiling wildly and surged around violently.

“What’s going on here?” Master Kun was taken aback as he did not know what had happened.

Right then, a strong golden ray of light lit up.

“Master Jian, step backward!” Master Kun screamed and immediately retreated.

Jian Wushuang retreated a few steps. At the same time when he retreated the huge furnace spar burst open as hot liquid lava flew out madly in all directions.

Jian Wushuang’s divine powers erupted and formed a barrier in front of him to block the hot liquid lava on the other side.

“Explosion?”

“How could it possibly explode? The Life Armor had already taken form.” Master Kun who was next to Jian Wushuang was talking loudly...

“No.” Master Kun’s eyes glistened again because he saw the golden light floating at the chamber top.

The golden light was extremely bright and within the rays of golden light was a completed Life Armor.

“The Life Armor was neither damaged nor exploded. Nonetheless, the furnace had indeed blown up. Besides, the aura of this armor is so strong!” Master Kun stared hard at the Life Armor basking in the golden light.

He could feel the aura emanated from the Life Armor was very powerful.

Its aura was much stronger than many Natural Treasures. Even the top-notch Natural Treasures had a subservient aura toward it.

“It has become an extraordinary Natural Treasure, has it not?” Master Kun was startled.

“Master Kun, what should I do next? Do I continue squeezing blood?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Blood essence?” Master Kun seemed to have understood something but still had doubts in his heart as he stared at the Life Armor for a while and said, “Try another drop.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and immediately squeezed another drop of blood essence, sending it towards the Life Armor.

The Life Armor instantly swallowed the drop of blood essence.

Then... Boom!

The Life Armor was already extremely powerful and had a much stronger aura than any Natural Treasure, yet its aura skyrocketed again by several folds more than before. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Next, hum... The Life Armor gave off an aura that countless experts would covet and at the same time was shining with a colorful glow.

Even though the chamber was located underground, it failed to stop the widespread aura and colorful glow.

In an instant, there were colorful clouds illuminating Heaven and Earth in the void above the chamber. The aura of a precious treasure permeated for thousands of miles.

“Colorful clouds? This sort of colorful clouds only appears when a Heavenly Treasure is born. Is this an anomaly of Heaven and Earth?”

“How is this possible?”

Master Kun was completely stunned.

He could not even believe he made the Life Armor.

It was a Heavenly Treasure!

A Heavenly Treasure that was highly sought after by any Ultimate God expert was successfully cultivated!

Most importantly, he had cultivated that Life Armor!

What’s a Life Armor? It was something closely related to the cultivator and was a progressing treasure. Its powers increased simultaneously with the strength of its cultivator.

Under normal circumstances, any newly cultivated Life Armor or Life Divine Weapon would be at the ordinary power. Its power was seldom able to match ordinary Earth Treasures.

However, the Life Armor he cultivated was at the level of a Heavenly Treasure!

What just happened?

It’s like two cultivators. One was just an ordinary man when he was born while the other was a Chaotic Divine Demon upon birth. How were they even comparable?

A Life Armor that attained the level of a Heavenly Treasure right after it was successfully cultivated would have an extremely bright future. Its powers would grow along with the power of its master and might even become a legendary Premier Treasure.

Premier Treasures only existed in the legend. Master Kun had only seen it in ancient books.

He still could not believe that he had made a precious Life Armor that could potentially be a Premier Treasure one day.

“How did this happen?”

Master Kun’s eyes were glistening as he looked at Jian Wushuang. “Was it because of Master Jian’s blood essence?”

“Yes, it must be Master Jian’s blood essence!”

Master Kun concluded.

He knew fully well that based on his cultivation skill and those instrument cultivation materials, the Life Armor would not have reached the level of an Earth Treasure under normal circumstances. Hence, it must be the two drops of blood essence which Jian Wushuang inserted that upgraded it to be a Heavenly Treasure!
