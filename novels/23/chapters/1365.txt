Chapter 1366: Sword Star

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Besides the most precious Real God Hall, Scripture Depository, and Reset Palace, there are four mystery lands, nine palaces, and three training fields.

“This definitely lives up to the reputation of the Lineage of Star. There are so many cultivation resources here. I wonder what the effect will be.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

Soon, Lei Chao brought Jian Wushuang to a corner of the void. There were stars before him.

“In the Lineage of Star, disciples from Star Palace can take up a star as a cultivation cave dwelling. Jian Wushuang, you can pick one now,” Lei Chao said.

“Use a star as a cultivation cave swelling?” Jian Wushuang was shocked but he didn’t hesitate. His Soul Power swept out and he noticed a star.

“That one, then,” Jian Wushuang pointed at the star and said.

“Let’s go,” Lei Chao brought Jian Wushuang to the star straightaway.

That star wasn’t huge in size but there was a continuous palatial architecture on the star. Right in the middle, there was a delicate looking cave dwelling.

Before Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang arrived at the cave dwelling, they noticed that there was a large number of people already standing before the cave dwelling.

Most of them were women and every one of them looked and dressed the same. The leader of them all was a woman who had a svelte body and a beautiful face.

The beautiful woman had an elegant style and a rare beauty. The aura that she gave out was fierce and she had obviously already reached the level of a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s arrival, everyone before the cave dwelling, including the beauty who was their leader, bowed politely as they said, “Greetings, master!”

“Master?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

The people before him were all Universe Gods. Among them, the leading beauty was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. But they were referring to him as master?

“These maids and servants are arranged for you. They will take care of your daily life while you concentrate on cultivation,” Lei Chao said.

“This…” Jian Wushuang didn’t know how he should react. He said, “I don’t need any maids or servants. I can just cultivate on my own.”

“Jian Wushuang.”

“Lei Chao looked over, “These maids and servants came to Lineage of Star willingly. There are benefits for them when they work for Lineage of Star, when they take care of the disciples of Lineage of Star. You don’t have to misunderstand them. To them, to be able to take care of the disciples of the Lineage of Star is definitely a great task. The benefits that they are taking is of course better. If you were to reject them, it would be a rather heavy loss to them.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned as he took a glance at the maid and servants around him. They did look worried and were obviously concerned that Jian Wushuang would chase them away.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but smiled bitterly and said, “Alright, let them stay then.”

The maid and servants immediately revealed a joyful expression.

“If so, you should cultivate well. This is a message token. If you run into any problems, you can look for me,’ Lei Chao passed him a token.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy as he took the token. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, Lei Chao left straightaway.

Jian Wushuang entered the cave dwelling with the maid and servants surrounding him.

At the top of the cave dwelling, Jian Wushuang stood on a stone stool while he overlooked the maids and servants who stood politely.

“Besides you, everyone can leave,” said Jian Wushuang, pointing at the beauty with the svelte body.

After they heard Jian Wushuang’s instructions, the maids and servants bowed and excused themselves. Only the beauty was standing there still.

“What’s your name?” Jian Wushuang looked at the beauty.

“Master, I am Qiu Yue!” The beauty replied politely.

“Qiu Yue, you don’t have to call me master from today onward. Nor will you refer to yourself as a servant. It’s rather uncomfortable for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

He knew that he was just a Universe God in the First Heaven and with the cover-up, he was just a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven.

But Qiu Yue was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. She was much stronger than him in terms of power!

A person who was stronger than him was referring to him as master so politely. Jian Wushuang, of course, found it rather strange.

“This…” Qiu Yue muttered to herself and then nodded, “Then, I shall call you Mister.”

“That’s fine,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “Qiu Yue, let me ask you. Is what Lei Chao said real? Did all of you came to be a servant in Lineage of Star willingly?”

“Of course,” Qiu Yue laughed, “Lineage of Star is the real ruling force of the Star Land. Regardless of wisdom or ability, they are at the top in the Eternal Chaotic World. Such a sect naturally has tens of thousands of geniuses and experts dying to join. However, the threshold to join Lineage of Star is too high. One must be a genius among geniuses. Like myself, even though I am Universe God in the Third Heaven, I am not gifted enough. So I am not qualified to be a disciple of Lineage of Star.”

“As I can’t be a disciple, there’s only another way to enter Lineage of Star, which is to become a maid, a servant!”

“Although maid and servants are one level lower, and might be put to great inconvenience, we are able to receive cultivation resources. Plus, Lineage of Star treats us, maid and servants, quite well. Under normal circumstances, as long as we stay in Lineage of Star for more than ten thousand years, we will receive a chance to enter the nine shrines!”

“Stay ten thousand years and we get to choose a secret skill from the first level of Shrine of Secret Skills to cultivate!”

“Stay for a million years and we get to experience the four mystery lands once!”

“That treatment is much better than many core disciples in weaker sects in Star Land!”

“Plus, if one were to be lucky enough, if one’s master were easy to talk to, he or she could ask for pointers from their master. How lucky would that be?”

Qiu Yue obviously had nothing to complain about being a maid in Lineage of Star. On the contrary, she was rather positive.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded silently.

He understood that any cultivator who was an expert but wasn’t gifted yet wouldn’t be happy about being ordinary, like Qiu Yue, as they couldn’t join and be nurtured by other sects, they might as well become a maid in Lineage of Star. They might stand a higher chance.

“Oh yeah, Mister. Now that you are the master of this star, you can name this star. Then we maids and servants of the Lineage can tell eachother where we serve,” Qiu Yue said.

“Name?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly paused and then smiled, “My name is Jian Wushuang. I have used the word sword in my name, and I am good with swords (Jian in Mandarin). As such, from today onwards, this star shall be known as Sword Star!”
