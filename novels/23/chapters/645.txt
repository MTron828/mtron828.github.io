Chapter 646: Victory!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While the Slaughter Body was under the attack, the World Body took the chance to sneakily attack Gong Chao’s head with the longsword.

However, Gong Chao brandished his long cudgel without looking at the World Body.

Peng!

Jian Wushuang was greatly taken back.

“This strength!” Jian Wushuang’s World Body sensed the terrifying power through the Heart-killing Sword and was knocked back.

Gong Chao charged forward like a Thunderbolt as his Stone Cudgel, with its mighty power, released Thunderbolt-like staff shadows to suppress his opponent.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Jian Wushuang waved his Heart-killing Sword to resist the terrifying attacks, but after deflecting a dozen staff shadows, the World Body was knocked down, causing a huge pit to form in the ground.

Thwack!

The broken stones were suddenly stirred up as the World Body rose into the air. Meanwhile, the Slaughter Body was picking up the Triple-kill Sword. The two Original Bodies stood side by side while staring at Gong Chao.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye.

Gong Chao’s strikes caused the Triple-kill Sword to be knocked away and the World Body to fall to the ground.

His terrifying battle strength shook everyone!

“The Second Occult!”

“He has comprehended the Second Occult of the Thunderbolt Dao.”

“Unbelievable!”

The experts in Skyward Pavilion were stupefied.

They all felt the terrifying power that Gong Chao released. It was obviously the second Occult of the Thunderbolt Dao.

It was incredible.

As for the Dao comprehension, it would be harder and harder to make breakthroughs.

The geniuses who entered the top 20 had only comprehended the first Occult. Most of them just started to touch the Second Occult.

Even Jian Wushuang had only comprehended a small part of the Second Occult of the World Dao.

Although Qianqiu Wuhen had a high understanding of the Second Occult, he still had a long way to go.

However, Gong Chao had a full understanding of the Second Occult of the Thunderbolt Dao.

“Monster!”

“What a monster!”

“A Skyscraping Realm genius that has a full understanding of the Second Occult of the Thunderbolt Dao? How is this possible?”

Everyone was stunned. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I throw in the towel.” Jian Wushuang spoke as his two Original Bodies merged into one.

His words caused an uproar for a while.

Gong Chao had already shown battle strength of the Second Occult, so it was unbelievable that Jian Wushuang would be able to push him farther than this.

How could he fight against Gong Chao?

Hearing that, the spectators shook their heads inwardly.

“I have a better understanding of the World Dao after one-month of meditation at Enlightenment Mountain, but I haven’t mastered the Second Occult as he did. This is...”?Jian Wushuang was astonished at his opponent’s strength.

He knew he still had a chance to win if he fought to the death.

“I might be able to defeat him if I use my Strongest Sword Soul and the strength from my flawless foundation.”?Jian Wushuang was deep in thought.

He had only exerted 80 percent of his Sword Soul Power.

He had pretended that he was at the ordinary Skyscraping Realm. If he used the superb strength that his flawless foundation provided, he would be stronger than he was now.

However, Jian Wushuang did not intend to do so.

After all, Emperor Xiao had asked him not to expose his Strongest Sword Soul and flawless foundation.

And he had proven himself, so there was no need to fight to the finish.

The battles between the strongest geniuses ended.

Gong Chao won!

In many experts’ eyes, the result was unsurprising, but it was not easy.

The two duelers’ strength was out of their expectations, far superior to the geniuses in the previous Firmament Territory Feasts.

Gong Chao had comprehended the Yin-Yang Dao and the Second Occult of the Thunderbolt Dao. It was rare to see such a monster in the Eternal World.

Jian Wushuang had also shown his terrifying strength.

After all, he came from the Ancient World, a plane world.

No one paid him any mind when the feast began, but now his strength shamed the other geniuses.

He had comprehended the World Dao and Slaughter Dao, and his terrifying Sword Soul Power might be the strongest among the other geniuses.

He had also invented a Rank Two Secret Skill, as had Gong Chao. Furthermore, he had mastered the Doppelganger Secret Skill.

Only Gong Chao was able to defeat him in this feast. As for Qianqiu Wuhen, he ranked third.

Qianqiu Wuhen had displayed his incredible strength during the fight with Feng, but he was still far inferior to Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao.
