Chapter 2725: Corpse Puppet

“There are innumerable stone coffins in this cemetery and we don’t exactly know what’s inside. We tried to open these stone coffins when we first came but failed so we can’t seem to find out what it is as well. All we did was walk blindly toward the deeper parts of this cemetery—that is the depths of this ancient castle.

“However, we came across a corpse puppet coming out of one of these stone coffins on our way!” Devilish Wind Kind said.

“Corpse puppet? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“The puppet is formed using a special method whereby the corpse of a cultivator is transformed into a puppet with part of the cultivator’s soul also integrated into the puppet. That is what we call a corpse puppet. These corpse puppets are much more terrifying as compared to ordinary war puppets because they carry part of the deceased cultivator’s soul power. Therefore, these puppets could perform many methods or techniques that the cultivator had used during his lifetime.

“Corpse puppets are well known in the Ancient God Domain as they can also hunt cultivators and devour a cultivator’s soul power to improve their own strength,” explained Devilish Win King.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk.

He heard of refining cultivators into puppets, but it was his first time hearing about integrating the cultivator’s soul into the puppet. What sounded even horrific was the fact that a corpse puppet could continuously improve itself by hunting cultivators and devouring their soul power.

“Are these corpse puppets powerful? How many are there in this cemetery?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well... You’ll find out soon when we see them.” Devilish Wind King smiled.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The group of six kept going but dared not go too fast.

They had been going for about less than a quarter of an hour when they passed on top of a stone coffin.

Bang!

A stone coffin abruptly lifted.

The small hill-sized lifted coffin slammed itself at Long Xianzi who happened to be the closest to it amongst those six people.

Long Xianzi did not fluster as he pointed at the coffin from a distance before it immediately exploded.

The six of them stopped and turned their eyes toward the stone coffin and noticed there was a figure lying within it.

They saw a skinny old man with gray hair that looked very much like a skeleton.

The old man’s skin color was a faint silver while both his cheeks were sunken in. He was lying in the coffin, but his eyes were opened. The pair of chilly eyeballs in his eye sockets widened while an unknown ghost fire filled the depths of his pupils.

In the next moment... Whoosh!

The gray-haired old man suddenly stood up as a stream of silver lights lit up.

“It’s a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.”

“It’s just a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. It’s not difficult to deal with.”

Saber Master glared coldly at the gray-haired old man.

“Look at his hand!” Long Xianzi suddenly exclaimed.

Everyone focused immediately and saw a dark ring on the gray-haired old man’s finger.

It was an Interspatial Ring.

“Haha, it seems like it’s our lucky day. The first corpse puppet we came across in this cemetery is wearing an Interspatial Ring.” Saber Master grinned.

“The ring must have belonged to his old man when he was alive and not a ring left by the secret realm’s master. He must be a powerful High-level Grand Ultimate God before his death since this is a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. The treasures in his Interspatial Ring should be extraordinary,” said Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen.

“Let’s talk no more. The six of us will destroy it together,” suggested Long Xianzi.

The six of them instantly agreed to it and immediately fired shots.

Boom!

Saber Master was the first to take action and displayed his strength that was several times stronger than an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God. He was the first to rush forward and fight the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was equally powerful. It did not have the capability to evaluate its opponent’s strength so it went all out.

The Saber Master very soon seized the fight advantage against the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

Jian Wushuang, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, Devilish Wind King, and Yi Shen were also firing shots from the surrounding area.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet could not stand against the attack for long. It was soon defeated by the team of six with its head cut off after a brief moment.

The group of six then collected its Interspatial Ring.

Saber Master laid the Interspatial Ring on his palm as the six of them scanned through it with their consciousness to check the treasures within.

There were a lot of great-valued treasures in the Interspatial Ring. The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was obviously much richer than an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

There were nearly 3,000 Divine Elixir Pill in the Interspatial Ring.

The amount was less than what Primary-level Grand Ultimate God Fo Yi had.

However, it was what any ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God should possess.

Even though Fo Yi was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, he was the leader of a second-rated force. He used to manage all the treasures and resources belonging to Star Fort, so it was normal for him to be wealthier than most ordinary Grand Ultimate Gods.

Ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods and even High-level Grand Ultimate Gods usually did not have many Divine Elixir Pills.

Divine Elixir Pill was hard to get after all.

In addition to the Divine Elixir Pills and a large number of resources, there were also many treasures in the Interspatial Ring. However, none of them were particularly valuable—nothing was sufficiently attractive to trigger a Grand Ultimate God’s greed or cause them to be vying for it.

“I’ll take thirty percent of the treasures in this Interspatial Ring while Hong Chen and Long Xianzi get twenty percent each. As for the three of you—Devilish Wind King, Yi Shen, and Su Han—each will take ten percent. Do you agree? “Saber Master looked over his shoulder.

Jian Wushuang and the others exchanged looks and immediately nodded. They were seemingly satisfied with the treasure distribution.

Saber Master had distributed the treasures based on their strength. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He was the most powerful among them so he took 30 percent whilst the two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods each took 20 percent. The remaining was shared between the three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods with each taking 10 percent. It was a fair arrangement.

In fact, Jian Wushuang and the three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods had gotten more than they deserved.

The treasures and resources were soon allocated according to their respective proportions.

After that...

“Let’s move along,” said Saber Master.

The six people carried on with their journey to venture deeper into the ancient castle.

On the way, Devilish Wind King looked at Jian Wushuang. “Alliance Master Su Han, how do you feel after seeing the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet just now?”

“He was very powerful. I guess he must’ve ranked quite high among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. I guess only Saber Master among the six of us could dominate him in a one-to-one battle. I’m afraid the few of us will have to retreat if we come across a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet alone,” said Jian Wushuang.
