——

After being weakened by the Purple Emperor Bell, the remaining power entered Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness and was blocked by the exquisite pagoda.

The defense ability of the exquisite pagoda against Jian Wushuang’s soul was more than ten times stronger than the Purple Emperor Bell.

The impact of the soul power on the exquisite pagoda was like a drop of water dropping into the sea, without causing too much of a ripple.

Even if the soul power continued to attack, the exquisite pagoda could easily withstand it.

“Is this the extent of the soul test?” Jian Wushuang muttered, but his expression suddenly changed, “No, it’s not that simple. The soul power is getting stronger. Yes, the crazy soul power is getting stronger!”

Jian Wushuang had already sensed it.

As time passed, the spiritual power was getting stronger and stronger.

Previously, the spiritual power was weakened by the Purple Emperor Bell and then rushed to the exquisite pagoda, so it could not cause too much of a stir. However, in just 15 minutes, the spiritual power was also coming through the Purple Emperor Bell, it was enough to cause the exquisite pagoda to tremble slightly.

An hour later, the exquisite pagoda was trembling crazily, and it was even on the verge of collapsing.

“Oh No.” Jian Wushuang’s face turned ugly.

The exquisite pagoda was his strongest soul defense method. Once the exquisite pagoda collapsed, the soul power could recklessly attack his physical soul, which was only at the level of an ordinary first-grade great divine master, although his soul was much stronger than his peers because he had lived two lives and was a perfect chaotic creature, he could not withstand the continuous soul attack.

Bang!

Finally, under the continuous soul attack, the exquisite pagoda in Jian Wushuang’s spiritual sea completely collapsed.

Once the exquisite pagoda collapsed, the continuous soul power directly attacked Jian Wushuang’s physical soul.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang let out a muffled groan, but he began to rely on his physical soul to resist the soul power.

However, it was obviously very difficult to resist.

Outside the dark void, Elder Gu stood quietly with his hands behind his back, his eyes extremely turbid.

Although he was not in the dark void, he clearly saw what happened in the dark void.

Elder Gu shook his head when he saw that Jian Wushuang’s soul defense had collapsed and he could only rely on his own soul to resist the soul attack.

“After all, this is a test left by my master. Although it’s the simplest and easiest, to pass it, one must have a soul that is infinitely close to that of the Immortal Saint and has a powerful soul defense technique. His soul must be extremely tough and can withstand the wear and tear. As for him... his soul defense ability is not weak, but his own soul level is too low!”

“He is only a junior great divine master, but he is still far from being a senior great divine master. Even though his soul is extremely tough, it will be completely crushed under the continuous impact of the soul power.”

“What a pity for such a genius.”

Elder Gu sighed secretly.

He felt that it was not worth it for Jian Wushuang and felt that it was a pity.

The last time Jian Wushuang came to this secret realm with the Saber Master and the others, he saw that Jian Wushuang was extremely talented and had big secrets. He was also very curious about Jian Wushuang and looked forward to his growth.

Therefore, before Jian Wushuang left, he specifically told Jian Wushuang to come to this secret realm again when he broke through to become an Immortal Saint.

But now, with great talent and promise, he is determined to try the test his master left behind.

As a result...

“He is dead for sure, it’s only a matter of time,” the old man said to himself.

In the Dark Void, as time went by, Jian Wushuang, who was in the middle of the soul storm, found it harder and harder to resist the soul attack. His real soul, under the impact of the soul power, became weaker and weaker.

In the blink of an eye, two hours had passed.

However, elder Gu had said that Jian Wushuang would last six hours in the test space. Now, only one-third of the time had passed, but Jian Wushuang was obviously unable to hold on any longer.

Buzz.

The physical soul in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness became weaker and weaker. Finally, there was no room for struggle.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang’s physical soul completely collapsed.

“Is he dead?”

“Two hours...”

Elder Gu shook his head secretly.

He had already seen Jian Wushuang’s soul completely destroyed.

Under such circumstances, even those Immortal Saints with immortal bodies were doomed to die. Elder Gu naturally thought that Jian Wushuang was already dead.

He was ready to withdraw from this test, but suddenly...

In the boundless dark space, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with a solemn expression.

In his sea of consciousness, the substantial soul, which had been completely destroyed, condensed again at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, it was condensed again. An intact substantial soul appeared there again, at the same time, it started to resist the soul attack again.

“What?”

Even Elder Gu was shocked when he saw this scene. His eyes were wide open.

“He, he didn’t die?”

“His soul was clearly completely annihilated. How could he not die?”

“Not only did he not die, but his soul was also completely restored? How is this possible?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Elder Gu could not believe what he was seeing.

He was the spirit of the secret realm, and his master was a high and Mighty Master of Laws.

His knowledge was also vast. He knew many strange things in the absolute beginning divine realm. Logically, nothing could make him lose his composure like this.

However, this scene really shocked him.

A cultivator’s soul was completely annihilated. How could he not die?

He even recovered in the blink of an eye?

How was this possible?

“Impossible! Impossible!!”

“Although the absolute beginning divine realm is vast and has countless experts when I followed my master to battle, I saw many world-shaking super experts. However, those experts used their souls as the core. If their souls weren’t destroyed, they wouldn’t die. If their souls were completely annihilated, unless someone used a heaven-defying method to reverse time and space, they would be resurrected. But this man...”

“He didn’t need any means, let alone the so-called reversal of time and space. He just casually recovered the soul that had been annihilated?”
