Chapter 1595: An Unforeseen Situation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Back then when they were in the pub, Jian Wushuang was worried that his Sword Principles would affect other people. Hence, he unleashed them with concern.

However, at that moment…

“Reincarnation of the Highest Heaven!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with a shrill light.

The whole universe turned completely dark and a frightening sword essence rushed beyond the highest heavens.

Real God Shi Jue was right in front of Jian Wushuang. Hence, he could feel Jian Wushuang’s attack clearly. He could feel that the frightening sword essence was heading toward him from all directions.

It was as if he had been locked onto by a hundred million sword shadows at the same time and there was no way for him to escape.

“This is… a stage two Real God Unique Skill?” Real God Shi Jue revealed a shocked expression.

He did not expect a Universe God to actually unleash a stage two Real God Unique Skill which could only be created by an Eternal Real God.

“Piss off!”

Real God Shi Jue was extremely furious and he changed into a strange Exotic Beast instantly. His body stretched and his five fingers came together to form a sharp claw with lightning speed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The sharp claw then changed into a silver, glittering light that looked as though it could tear the universe apart.

Bam!

With a loud sound, Jian Wushuang and Real God Shi Jue’s bodies were forced to retreat a few steps due to the impact.

“How can this be?” Real God Shi Jue raised his head fearfully.

Although Jian Wushuang had used a stage two Real God Unique Skill, he was ultimately still a Universe God. Even though Real God Shi Jue had fought against him seriously, he was actually evenly matched with Jian Wushuang?

“Shi Jue, die!”

A loud, fierce roar could be heard from above Real God Shi Jue.

“Not good,” Real God Shi Jue’s expression changed greatly. However, Real God Wu Liang had already appeared above him and at the same time, the black épée on his hands was swung downward.

It was just like a giant black cloud.

All of a sudden, the enormous black cloud, which contained an earth-shaking power, descended.

Moreover, at the area near Real God Shi Jue, two green, giant hands had caught his body and he was unable to unleash his martial art motion.

Real God Shi Jue struggled with all his might and shook off the green giant hands. When the black cloud descended upon him, he swung his sharp claws around again.

His claws, which could tear open the universe, had only torn apart a very small portion of the black cloud and the black cloud continued to cover his body.

“Puff!”

Real God Shi Jue spat out a mouthful of blood straight away and his body fell toward the ground.

“Bam!”

Real God Shi Jue crashed into a black tower, creating a giant hole. However, in just a short moment, with a “boom” sound, the black tower was completely broken into pieces and Real God Shi Jue’s body flew up again.

At that moment, his expression was pale and there was also some blood at the corners of his mouth. This caused him to look extremely miserable. However, at that moment, he was sending a message like his life depended on it.

“Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin, come and save me quickly!”

“The Lineage of Star has come for me and I am unable to stop them.”

“If I die, that item will land in the hands of the Lineage of Star!”

Real God Shi Jue was extremely anxious.

Swish!

A ghost-like body appeared in front of him again and at the same time, hundreds of swordlights headed toward him abruptly.

“Damn it!” Real God Shi Jue had a very unpleasant expression.

He could tell that the Lineage of Star had made ample preparations to kill him this time around. For the three of them who had besieged him, each of them had their own abilities.

In particular, Real God Wu Liang’s attack power was exceptionally high and one stroke was enough to wound him fatally. Thus, Real God Wu Liang possessed the ability to kill him.

As for the two other people, they were working with Real God Wu Liang harmoniously.

For example, Real God Fei Yan was controlling the green and mighty current to restrict him continuously so that he would be unable to escape.

As for the Universe God, who was using a sword in front of him, even though he looked like a Universe God, his abilities were also impressive. The most important thing was his martial art motion, which was actually not inferior to his own.

It should be known that Real God Fei Yan was most proficient in martial art motion. With such a level of martial art motion, even if Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan were to team up, he could use his own martial art motion to deal with them. Moreover, he could deal with them for a very long period of time or even find an opportunity to escape.

However, at that moment, the Universe God could actually match him in martial art motion. Moreover, the Universe God could fight with him time after time and then create an opening for Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan to kill him.

“With these three experts working together, it will be impossible for me to escape!”

“Unless Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin get here in time, I will definitely die!”

Real God Shi Jue was very clear about that.

Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin would most likely come to his rescue and there was still a shard of hope for him. However, if he were to be besieged by the three of them somewhere else, he would give up all hope and stop resisting.

Boom! Boom! Bam!

At the void, Jian Wushuang, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan had teamed up and they were attacking Real God Shi Jue crazily from all directions.

Real God Shi Jue was completely suppressed and he could not counter-attack at all.

However, Real God Shi Jue was ultimately an expert at the level of an Eternal Real God and his ability to keep himself alive was strong. After clashing many times, even though the injuries on his body had gotten worse continuously, he was still not killed.

However, at that moment…

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed abruptly.

“Not good. Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin have come,” Jian Wushuang shouted.

“What?” Real God Wu Liang’s expression could not help but change.

“How are they so fast? Didn’t they leave this town already? Even if they were to receive Real God Shi Jue’s message for help straight away, they would definitely need about half a day’s time to return here,” Real God Fei Yan said with surprise.

“There’s one possibility. The Soaring Heaven King Palace might have planted a secret wormhole within this town. By going through the wormhole, Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin would be transported here right away,” Jian Wushuang said.

Transportation via a wormhole would naturally be faster than flying over.

The Soaring Heaven King Palace was the overlord of this piece of land. Thus, it was highly possible that they had planted a secret wormhole within the town.

However, transportation via a wormhole was not easy, especially for long distance transportation. Hence, if the experts were not in a rush, they would rather travel by themselves.

At that moment, Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin, who were thought to have gone far away, had appeared on the battlefield abruptly. As such, this brought about an unforeseen situation for Jian Wushuang and the two Elders.

As for Real God Shi Jue, who was seriously injured and was about to reach his limit, he was delighted when he saw the arrival of Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin.

“Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan of the Lineage of Star. As for the other person, if my guess is not wrong, you are the Inverse Cultivator Jian Wushuang who is famous in the Eternal Chaotic World, right?” a hearty laugh could be heard from the void not too far away. Two blurry shadows then appeared in the void.

“An Inverse Cultivator?” Real God Shi Jue could not help but glance at Jian Wushuang.

Previously, he had been hiding in the Holy Kingdoms that were extremely far away from the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries all the while and it was only until recently that he returned. Hence, he had never heard of Jian Wushuang.

However, after hearing what Real God Dan Ding had said at that moment, he understood.

“No wonder his abilities are so impressive. It’s because he’s an Inverse Cultivator!”
