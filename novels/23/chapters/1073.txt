Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Turning into a scarlet Flowing Light, Celestial Master Winter Whistle appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, while Silver-armored Ancient God approached from a different direction.

The two Holy Masters combined their battle strength, but Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. When the battle intent was skyrocketing, he took a step and drew a blood moon in the Void with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand. All those were finished in a flash.

Celestial Master Winter Whistle was holding a saber. Before he could take any action, the blood moon drawn by Jian Wushuang had drawn near.

“How could it be so fast?” Celestial Master Winter Whistle was slightly surprised, and he waved the saber immediately.

The blade light swept across the void like a Thunderbolt. The explosive power of it smashed the void after meeting Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

“Nine Waves!”

Celestial Master Winter Whistle spoke coldly, and then he let out a chilly blade light.

The ripples spread toward Jian Wushuang, and he felt as if he was being drawn into the deepest sea. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s so weird.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. He could feel that the ripples were actually layers of chilly blade light.

The blade light was surging toward him endlessly like crazy, which was extremely weird.

Jian Wushuang had to resort to his sharp sword. The power of Three Sword Principle was put into full play.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Nine crashes sounded one after another, and the nine crashes were completed in the blink of an eye. Under the impact, Jian Wushuang himself was forced to take a step back.

At this moment, a chilly wind came to Jian Wushuang’s ears. He turned his head immediately and saw that Silver-armored Ancient God formed from Battle Formation had appeared behind him. A tough fist punched the back of his head.

Jian Wushuang turned around suddenly, and there was a cold flash in his eyes. The Blood Mountain Sword struck like lightning.

This sword was the Death Shadow Sword.

Although the echo of the sword had just spread, the consciousness attack already exerted power on the Silver-armored Ancient God and then passed onto the nine Ancient God Guards in no time.

The nine Ancient God Guards were merely at the level of Dao Master. Suffering the consciousness attack, all of them became unconscious. Silver-armored Ancient God stopped moving as well.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang’s sword swept across Silver-armored Ancient God’s arm and cut off a large piece of flesh formed from Ancient God Power. He then kicked him away and the huge Silver-armored Ancient God immediately flew backward.

As soon as Jian Wushuang repelled Silver-armored Ancient God, he found that a silent blade light had appeared by his side.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted. The blade light came so quickly and quietly that he did not have enough time to fend against it with his sword. He could hardly hold the Blood Mountain Sword at his chest.

Clang!

The blade light crushed on the Blood Mountain Sword, and a terrible force was passed on Jian Wushuang. Suddenly he was knocked back.

Jian Wushuang was unable to steady himself until he had been flung back 10,000 Li.

Raising his head again, he saw Celestial Master Winter Whistle standing side by side with Silver-armored Ancient God, both of whom had an extremely strong aura.

“I was being negligent. When the two medium Holy Masters combine their battle strength, indeed I cannot withstand them.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He knew that at this moment, even if he was facing a medium Holy Master, it would be strenuous for him. Whether he could win or not was uncertain.

However, it was beyond his ability to win against the two medium Holy Masters who had joined hands.

“I cannot withstand them alone, but what if there were two of me?”

Jian Wushuang sniggered secretly. As he moved his body, a black-robed figure appeared by his side.

The countenance and aura were exactly the same as Jian Wushuang’s一it was his Slaughter Body.

“Is that a… doppelganger?”

All the experts looked at Jian Wushuang, and some of them frowned.

Usually, the doppelganger was no match for the original body in terms of strength.

The strength of Jian Wushuang’s original body was in defiance of the natural order, and it was comparable to that of a medium Holy Master. However, they did not believe that Jian Wushuang’s doppelganger was also in defiance of the natural order.

Normally, the doppelganger of Jian Wushuang had the battle strength of a Dao Master at most, but relying on a Dao Master’s battle strength, he was not even qualified to join such a battlefield.

Jian Wushuang sensed that the people who were watching were astonished and doubtful. He sneered, not caring about their reaction.

How could those people know his ability when they were ignorant of the Heavenly Creation Skill and the potential of Inverse Cultivation?

Buzz!

As the vast aura rose, the Bloodline Power of Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body surged furiously. The next moment he turned into a huge Dark Gold Ancient God. At the same time, the Flowing Lights went out of Jian Wushuang’s Interspatial Ring. There were a total of 72 Flowing Lights.

The Flowing Lights combined perfectly in the void and then turned into a purple lightsaber.

The lightsaber was the result of Jian Wushuang’s perfect practice of the second step of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“My Slaughter Body has the same battle strength as my World Body. The difference is that my World Body possesses two treasures, namely the Blood-killing Plate Armor and the Blood Mountain Sword, which enable my strength to reach a new level.” Jian Wushuang had a dignified expression.

Blood-killing Plate Armor and Blood Mountain Sword had a great impact on his strength.

However, he could only provide the two treasures to his Original Body.

“The Slaughter Body is not equipped with Blood-killing Plate Armor or Blood Mountain Sword. However, resorting to the top Three-star Imperial Kinsmen’s Ancient God Power, combined with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, the battle strength will reach the Holy Master Level.In addition toAncient God’s killing strategy, he is competent enough to fight against Silver-armored Ancient God.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed sharply.

His rivals were Celestial Master Winter Whistle and Silver-armored Ancient God. Celestial Master Winter Whistle had reached the solid battle strength of a medium Holy Master, which was no weaker than Celestial Master Lei Yi. However, Silver-armored Ancient God was not able to fully exert his strength, hence he wasweaker than Celestial Master Winter Whistle.

“My World Body’s battle strength was stronger than that of Celestial Master Winter Whistle. A quarter of an hour would be enough for me to defeat him.” Jian Wushuang glanced at his Slaughter Body.

“It is just a quarter of an hour, I will handle it.” the Slaughter Body nodded.

“Let’s start!”

Jian Wushuang muttered, and immediately the two Original Bodies moved at the same time.

“Die!”

Celestial Master Winter Whistle had a gloomy complexion. As soon as Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies moved, he rushed toward them along with Silver-armored Ancient God.

Soon, the two sides clashed with each other head-to-head.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword with soaring Sword Essence. He blocked Celestial Master Winter Whistle, and produced a shining sword light to strike him.

The Slaughter Body had a cold expression. He was gathering enormous Ancient God Power in his hand and applied the Ancient God First Finger, which struck Silver-armored Ancient God. Suddenly, there was a sharp and piercing wind-breaking sound. The purple lightsaber exerted by the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation also struck its object with breathtaking speed.
