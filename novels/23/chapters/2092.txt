Chapter 2093 Chaos

Within the four Sanctuaries, while the brawl between Special Tribes was in full swing.

In the great Hall of the Ancient God Clan.

“Ancient Emperor, I bring news from the other tribes. Many tribes now are in a complete mess,” King Chen Xing reported solemnly.

“What exactly happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Special Tribes Alliance was already formed, all that needed to happen was for the tribes to gather their strength and prepare for battle. Yet at such a crucial period of time, this had happened.

“We do not know the specifics, but information from the tribes shows some sort of mutiny within themselves, slaughtering one another. Other tribes report sudden assaults from foreign clans, especially from those with a past grudge. Some of them were attacked by black-robed experts…”

“Many tribes are in a wreck now, fights are happening everywhere. Some of them can’t take the pressure, and have requested for us to send some of our own experts over.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened upon hearing that.

“It’s the Archelon Palace!” Jian Wushuang’s fists clenched uncontrollably. “Hngh, I thought they could only infiltrate the human domains… but now they’ve influenced our special tribes as well. They have done it so well. One movement from them was enough to create such big waves…”

From the current severity of it, Jian Wushuang was sure it was the doing of Archelon Palace.

Such brilliant infiltration, within the Eternal Chaotic World…only the Archelon Palace could have done it.

“What about the other three big Clans? How are they?”

“They’re doing fine. God Eater Clan saw its own share of mutiny, however, along with the attack of the black-robes. But it’s nothing the God Eaters cannot handle. As for the Sky Swallowing Clan and the Black Dragon Clan, all is calm,” King Chen Xing replied.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He understood the Sky Swallowers’ inactivity, but the Black Dragons…

“King Chen Xing, get your people to keep an eye on the others, especially the Sky Swallowing Clan. If my calculations are correct, they will make their move soon,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Make their move? Why?” King Chen Xing and the others were puzzled. They had never suspected the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Jian Wushuang fell silent for a moment, before he replied, “I previously received information from Emperor Bai of the human Sanctuary Alliance. The Sky Swallowing Clan’s movements have become increasingly suspicious and they have interacted with experts of the Archelon Palace. Add that to how they behave during the coronation, I’m almost certain they have colluded with the Archelon Palace, perhaps even following them.”

“What?”

King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu, King Zhan Cang were all astonished.

The Sky Swallowing Clan, colluding with the Archelon Palace?

If this information were correct, it would prove to be a devastating blow to the Special Tribes.

After all, the Sky Swallowers were part of the top Four Special Tribes, just next to the Ancient Gods.

The Sky Swallowing Clan was so formidable, and so influential within the Special Tribes domain.

“Things are not as simple as they seem because of this,” Jian Wushuang mumbled, before lifting his head once again. “King Zhan Cang!”

“Oh Great Emperor,” King Zhan Cang immediately took a bow.

“Take some experts from our clan and dispatch them to others that require our help. You will lead this team, and be quick about it, we do not have much time. Crises that cannot be mediated, you are allowed to settle them in your own way. Kill every single black-robe you meet along the way as well, do not hesitate,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Understood,” King Zhan Cang replied.

“Ancient Emperor, with everything that’s going on, we have more than ten tribes alone asking us for help. Will King Zhan Cang’s team be enough?” King Luo Yu frowned.

“It won’t be, but we don’t have a choice,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly. “It’s normal for these tribes to seek my help as Special Tribes Alliance Chief, but it is not possible for me to help them all at once, especially during times like these.”

“Let them handle some stress on their own for now. It’s only been some small-scale mutiny and black-robe attacks after all. If they can’t handle this much on their own after having existed for so long I don’t see why they should continue to exist.”

“And we, we have more important things to do!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“King Chen Xing,” Jian Wushuang look towards him. “Prepare a small team of elite experts. Quality over quantity. They will follow me out.”

“Ancient Emperor, you’re going out?” King Chen Xing and King Luo Yu looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“Yea,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “King Luo Yu, you will run the Ancient God Clan in my absence. Even though King Zhan Cang and I have taken quite a few experts, there are many more seven-star experts that will remain, along with you the nine-star Ancient God… it should be enough to mitigate any crisis.”

“Indeed, rest assured,” King Luo Yu replied.

Jian Wushuang nodded and soon took off.

Within the Ancient God Clan, Jian Wushuang and King Chen Xing formed a line in front of the enormous wormhole. Behind them were several more figures.

Among these figures were the familiar King Gu You and King Gu Tong brothers, and six more eight-star Ancient Gods behind them. The remainder were seven-starred. This was a pretty strong team.

“Ancient Emperor, where are we heading?” King Chen Xing asked.

“To the Black Dragon Sanctuary,” Jian Wushuang replied directly.

“The Black Dragon Sanctuary?” King Chen Xing flinched. “That Sanctuary is controlled by the Black Dragon Clan, and they’ve been relatively quiet as of now. Is this necesssary?”

“Haha, is because the Black Dragon Clan has been too quiet. We have to make haste.” Jian Wushuang was sure.

He had an instinct, something was happening at the Black Dragon Clan.
