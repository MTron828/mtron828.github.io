After all, other than the Young Emperor whose strength was not announced, the other six had once fought to a draw with three Yan Immortals.

In addition, each Prince could also bring along a companion with a profound cultivation base, which could basically eliminate any single Yan Immortal.

Of course, ‘erase’ did not mean killing directly, but teleporting out of the game.

In the end, only the Princes were left to fight for the Peaches.

Even so, the Yan Immortals who were able to participate in the Heavenly Court’s banquet were still in a rush for it.

Although it was impossible to obtain Immortal Peaches, there were countless opportunities in the Heavenly Realm of the Heavenly Court. If he could obtain even a trace of Immortal Enlightenment somewhere, it would be a great transformation!

Therefore, apart from the few Princes, most of the people who participated in the Peach fight were after the supreme opportunity.

The huge river stood for eternity, and the vegetation was lush.

Every blade of grass, every tree, every mountain, and every river in the Heavenly Realm already had the fate of a living being. As they shuttled through it, the Yan power in their bodies was sublimating at a subtle speed.

At the same time, there were also Immortal spirits that inherited the fate of the Heavenly Dao, which were very unfriendly to these intruders.

Unfortunately, when Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor were preparing to cross the river on a reed booaoot, an unknown Immortal spirit at the bottom of the water raised a huge wave and threw them into the water.

Fortunately, the Immortal spirit in the water did not have any evil intentions. After teasing them for a while, it disappeared.

“Damn it, it’s really impossible to guard against things like this!” Jian Wushuang, who had reached the shore in a sorry state, fell on his back.

After the previous big voyage, he developed some resistance to water. He was afraid of encountering the giant Sea Sky Octopus again, an unknown and terrifying creature.

The Young Emperor’s performance was not much better than Jian Wushuang’S. He was also panting slightly and looked helpless.

“Since the water route is not easy to take, then let’s take the mountain route. One year seems sufficient, but in this vast Heavenly Realm, it is not enough,” Jian Wushuang analyzed and looked at the wild forest.

The Young Emperor nodded. “Up to you.”

However, just as the two were about to plan the route, an Immortal Spirit that looked like a giant ape but had a dragon’s head quietly poked out its huge head from the forest in front of them.

The black hole-like nostrils spewed out turbid breath, which was far more violent than a hurricane.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor looked at each other and saw a touch of bitterness in each other’s eyes.

…

Boom!

A Yan Immortal was defeated with a single palm strike. At this moment, the space between Prince Jiu’s handsome brows was filled with gloominess.

Behind him, dozens of Yan Immortals had gathered.

A moment later, Prince Jiu said in a low voice, “Go and check in groups. Try not to cause a big conflict with the Yan Immortal who is following Prince Yan. However, if you can eliminate them directly, don’t hold back.”

The dozens of Yan Immortals agreed at the same time and scattered all over the Heavenly Realm.

“Do you think Prince Yan will get the Immortal Peach this time?”

The white-robed Yan Immortal revealed a strange smile. “Second Young Master, you must be joking. Do you think a weak and sick Young Emperor can achieve anything?”

The Prince furrowed his brows and said in a deep voice, “My Friend, watch your words and actions. You’d better keep the fact that Prince Yan is sick to yourself. Otherwise, if my Imperial Father finds out, I’ll be implicated too.”

“Yes, Second Young Master,” the white-robed Yan Immortal lowered his head and admitted his mistake. “In other words, he is no match for you.”

Prince Jiu did not speak, but his brows slowly relaxed.

“That’s right, if it wasn’t for Imperial Father’s protection, this shameful guy would have died before he was even born.”

With the True Blood and fate energy of an Emperor flowing in their bodies, whether it was in terms of the level of life or the perception of the Great Dao, they were far superior to the top cultivators of the same realm. This advantage was even more obvious after entering the realm of the Yan Immortal.

However, there was a special case among the seven of them, and that special case was Prince Yan.

As the eldest son of an Emperor, his life force and physique had been extremely weak since birth, and he almost died. He was also accompanied by all kinds of illnesses and could not cultivate at all.

This was simply a humiliation. As the person who controlled the Great Dao and created the Heavenly Court with the bloodline of an Emperor, he had actually suffered from such an unimaginable illness.

He really could not figure out how his Imperial Father, who had a domineering mind, could have a bloodline that was sick and sick.

Not even a single treasure in the Heavenly Realm could cure him. It was like some kind of curse that accompanied him until his death.

The Young Emperor who was sick became the exclusive property of Emperor Zhen Wuyang. Other than the six Princes and their companions, no one else knew about it.

“How can a guy who spits out blood from the slightest bit of strenuous exercise be worthy of competing with me?”

A glint of pleasure appeared in the depths of Prince Jiu’s eyes. He thought to himself, ‘Since I can’t stop you from coming to the Heavenly Court, I’ll stomp you under my feet ruthlessly in front of Imperial Father and the others this time!’

…

“What’s the approximate location of the Immortal Peach?”

“Second Prince, there is a special fluctuation in the direction of Jiao Province. Fourth Prince and Fifth Prince are likely to be there.”

“Go to Jiao Jiao Province and spread the news that all the Yan Immortals along the way must kill Prince Yan!”

…

“Ang!”

A deafening roar reverberated through the forest, and at the same time, the ancient trees began to collapse.

An extremely huge monster ape ran through the forest, its strong body easily crushing the giant trees in its way. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Upon closer inspection, two figures dressed like Rangers were lying on the monster ape’s broad silver-furred back, seemingly satisfied.

Jian Wushuang burped and gave the Young Emperor a thumbs up.

Just a moment ago, a fish the size of a small mountain had entered the stomach of the two of them and the monster.

What Jian Wushuang did not expect was that this Prince, who always had a gloomy face and looked like someone owed him cash, was actually an expert at roasting fish.

With just a piece of rock salt and a pile of towering trees, a delicious grilled fish was simply roasted.

Jian Wushuang had long given up on food.

The reason why he wanted to grill the fish was that when he was fighting with the monster ape under him, a fish Immortal with intelligence floated up from the water to join in the fun. Coincidentally, a stray sword strike from Jian Wushuang accidentally hit it and sent it to heaven.

Adhering to the principle of not wasting anything, Jian Wushuang reluctantly took it out of the water and prepared to sacrifice it.

The Young Emperor took over and grilled the fish to delicious perfection.

“You ate my grilled fish, so you have to help me get the Immortal Peach.” The Young Emperor raised his eyebrows and looked at Jian Wushuang, who was satisfied.
