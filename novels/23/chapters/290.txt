Chapter 291: Slaughter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All the experts were astonished.

They were shocked indeed.

They did not expect that a Half-saint expert would run away.

“Xue Ying...” The Lord of Demons Island was also stunned while recalling Xue Ying’s words.?“His life was threatened? A kid in the Initial Ying Void Realm could threaten his life?”

No matter how shocked they were, Xue Ying was definitely running away.

However, Jian Wushuang had not agreed to let him escape.

“Since you came, stay here forever.” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice, full of laughter, resounded through the area. Then he immediately chased after Xue Ying. As Xue Ying’s speed was affected by the Realm of Sword Essence, Jian Wushuang easily caught up with him.

“Kiddo, I’m leaving. I’ve decided I don’t want to be involved in your fight. Don’t push me!” Xue Ying glanced at Jian Wushuang and cried out.

“Don’t push you? You attacked and killed our Protectors. Didn’t you already go too far?” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice, but sneered in his heart,?“It’s not easy to meet an opponent like you. I won’t let you go so easily.”

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang rushed toward Xue Ying.

“You really want to kill me?” Xue Ying roared with a scary look.

“I’ll have a try and see whether I’m able to kill you!”

Jian Wushuang grinned. Then his soaring killing intent spread out. The sky seemed to darken. Faced with such tremendous killing intent, other experts could not help but feel frightened.

The moment Jian Wushuang raised the Triple-kill Sword high, a towering Phantom Giant appeared behind him and held up a Long Sword as well. Suddenly, the stroke slashed down.

Blood Emptying Technique, the First Move.

Boom!

The murderous stroke appeared in front of Xue Ying. Faced with its power, Xue Ying could not help being frightened.

“This is... Slaughter Origin?”?Xue Ying was shocked.

Jian Wushuang had used World Origin while fighting with him. Though it made him perfect in all aspects, it limited his strength so that his attacks were not as offensive. That was the reason why Xue Ying dared to say that Jian Wushuang could not kill him.

However, Slaughter Origin was totally different from World Origin.

Slaughter Origin emphasized killing, which was more offensive power than World Origin.

The power of this stroke Jian Wushuang performed caused the area to shake. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I’m in big trouble!”

Xue Ying widened his eyes and made up his mind to fight to the death.

“Blood Spirit!”

With a terrifying look, Xue Ying was suddenly surrounded by a blood light. The streaks of light gathered in his palm, and his fingertips, as well as his eyes, immediately became extremely red.

Suddenly, Xue Ying rushed forward, like a wild wolf pouncing on its prey in the dark. Then he waved his claw.

The stroke pieced the air, humming violently.

After colliding with the Killing Sword... Boom!

The strongest move Xue Ying was able to perform was completely overwhelmed.

“How is this possible?” It surprised Xue Ying when his strongest move was defeated so easily.

“The sword in your hand...” Xue Ying stared at the Triple-kill Sword.

Now he knew, that Long Sword was extraordinary.

“Don’t struggle. Accept your death obediently. My sword can’t wait to drink your blood,” Jian Wushuang said with a sneer. Then he appeared in front of Xue Ying. Against the Realm of Sword Essence, Xue Ying could not escape, but he still tried his best to struggle.

After a while, a wave of sword strikes stabbing a body was heard. Then Xue Ying’s aura began to vanish. Xue Ying let out a snarl, resounding throughout the whole area.

“Lord of Demons Island, you set me up!”

The rumble made the whole battlefield quiet.

Everyone was in shock as they watched Xue Ying’s body falling down.

Everyone looked awed at that moment.

“A real Half-saint expert died like this? A young expert in the Initial Yang Void Realm actually killed him?”

“Run, run now!” Lord of Demons Island, floating above the area, let out a terrifying cry.

At this moment, Xue Ying’s words still resounded in his ear.

After Xue Ying died, Demons Island suffered from low morale. More importantly, Jian Wushuang had the time to attack the other Devils of Demons Island, and he was able to slaughter all of them easily.

There was no doubt that Demons Island lost this fight.

It was an extremely miserable defeat.

They invited a helper, but still failed in the end.

All of this resulted because of one person, Jian Wushuang.

“The Heartless Sect has such a powerful young expert. Has he really only reached the Initial Yang Void Realm?”?The Lord of Demons Island shook his head with resignation.

As Demons Island started to retreat, the Heartless Sect seized the opportunity to hunt them down.

“Haha, kill them all!”

Many experts of the Heartless Sect roared with excitement while chasing their opponents.

Jian Wushuang did not follow the crowd, because he did not put those Devils in his eyes. Now he fixed his eyes on the Lord of Demons Island.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang dashed out and appeared by his target’s side in an instant.

The face of the Lord of Demons Island immediately changed.

“Haha, Swordsman, we can work together to kill the Lord of Demons Island. How about it?” The Master of Heartless Sect looked toward Jian Wushuang with a smile and spoke politely.

“OK, let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Crap.”?The Lord of Demons Island narrowed his eyes. The next moment he ran away without hesitation.

“You can’t escape.” Jian Wushuang stared at the Lord of Demons Island and knew his intention. He immediately launched an attack and the Realm of Sword Essence swept out like the tide.

The Lord of Demons Island was stuck inside, and his speed suddenly plunged.

Jian Wushuang and the Master of Heartless Sect did not give him any chance to strike back, directly rushing forward.
