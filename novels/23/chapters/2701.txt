Chapter 2702: Look for A Helper

“Fo Wu whom I’ve killed had a special position in Star Fort. I’ll come the moment I received news if I’m the Star Fort Master and give the culprit no chance to plan for his escape.

“Don’t mention about two years... The Star Fort Master might personally arrive within half a month,” said Jian Wushuang secretly.

It seemed impossible for him to achieve another breakthrough within half a month to the Heaven Ultimate God realm.

“There’s absolutely no way. I guess I can only ask for help from Palace Keeper Si Zhen.” Jian Wushuang then took out a Message Token.

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen.” Jian Wushuang sent a message to Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen also quickly responded, “Jian Yi, are you sending me a message to ask about the sale of the Royal Blood Gem? I’ve told you that it’s not easy to handle the Royal Blood Gem. Besides, the Fort Master has been busy working on this issue, but there’s no definite news yet. You might have to wait longer but you can tell me if you need more Primordial Stones.”

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen, I’m not here to ask about the Royal Blood Gem. There’s something I want to seek for your help.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“What’s the matter?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked.

“Well, I urgently need the help of a Grand Ultimate God. I don’t need him to fight for me. All I need is for him to stay within the force that I’ve created. He’ll just need to send the enemy away when someone comes and provokes me. I’ll probably need his help for two years at most,” said Jian Wushuang.

“You need a Grand Ultimate God helper?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen pondered momentarily but he did not ask Jian Wushuang for the specific reason and said, “If you’re looking for Grand Ultimate God, we have a few here in Crimson Stone Fort who are loyal to the Fort Master. I’m sure it can be arranged as long as the Fort Master orders one of them to offer their help to you for two years. However, you probably don’t want to use the experts from Crimson Stone Fort, right?”

“Yes, I still don’t want people to know the force I’ve created is closely related to Crimson Stone Fort, hence I prefer a free and independent Grand Ultimate God to help me. Palace Keeper Si Zhen, you have many friends. Can you help me to get in touch with your contacts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, I do know a few powerful Grand Ultimate Gods who aren’t attached to any forces as there are several within the Danyang Continent. I think it’s possible to ask them to be your helper for two years, but they’ll probably ask for a very high amount of rewards in return,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“I think there’s always room for discussion as long as he can help me eliminate an immediate problem and doesn’t ask for an outrageous amount in return,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang knew there was no free lunch in the world. He would have to pay a reasonable price if he wanted the help of a Grand Ultimate God.

“I’ll help you ask around then,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen, could you please help me find one as soon as possible. I need one very urgently as there may be a strong enemy coming at any time,” pleaded Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry, it won’t take long.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen smiled reassuringly.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen indeed sent Jian Wushuang another message in less than half an hour.

“I’ve contacted a Grand Ultimate God. He doesn’t have a name, but most people who know him call him Old Snake or Strange Old Snake. He’s a very powerful Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and had promised to be your helper for two years, but he’s asking for a thousand Divine Elixir Pills and one billion Primordial Stones in return!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen said.

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth twitched slightly.

“He indeed asked for a lot!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

1,000 Divine Elixir Pills and 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones were far less than the treasures Jian Wushuang had previously obtained from Shi Mo.

It was indeed a high price to pay.

However, he knew it was not easy to get help from those aloof Grand Ultimate Gods.

It was worthwhile to pay 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills and 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones in exchange for a powerful Primary-level Grand Ultimate God to be at his service for two years.

“Old Snake is asking for Divine Elixir Pills only since Primordial Stones were of little use and were probably just a number to him. He had asked for four thousand Divine Elixir Pills but I’ve persuaded him to go with the current arrangement. He agreed after considering the close-knitted relationship with myself and Crimson Stone Fort,” explained Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Really? I should thank you then.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You’re welcome, I’ve already told him everything and he’s ready to make a move at any time. You may send me your location and I’ll ask him to immediately go look for you,” added Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“In that case, please ask him to come as soon as possible,” said Jian Wushuang as he shared his location with Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen then helped Jian Wushuang to sort it out quickly.

All Jian Wushuang had to do was wait quietly in Dragon City.

During his waiting period, experts from Sword Alliance were busy integrating the three forces—Corpse Mansion, Divine Dragon Pavilion, and Purple Dress House.

Five days had passed in the blink of an eye. They were still busy with integrating those forces but Old Snake had arrived.

In a void not far from the Dragon City, a dark old man dressed in a black robe who had a triangular head pattern-skinned green snake on his shoulder stood quietly. The old man had concealed his divine power breath while giving people a feeling of tranquility and calmness. However, his gaze was extremely cold like the pupils of the viper on his shoulder.

“I’m Jian Yi. A pleasure to meet you, Old Snake.”

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the old man and humbly paid obeisance while trying to study the other party.

“Are you the young guy named Jian Yi mentioned by Palace Keeper Si Zhen?” The old man nonchalantly glanced at Jian Wushuang and immediately stretched out his hand. “Give me my reward first.”

Jian Wushuang was startled.

He would only pay a part for the deposit under normal circumstances with the rest to be given after two years.

However, Old Snake had demanded to be paid at the very beginning.

Jian Wushuang felt that Old Snake would care about his identity as a Grand Ultimate God and would not eat his words. Moreover, he was Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s friend. There should not be any problems with his credibility so Jian Wushuang gave Old Snake the 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills and 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Jian Wushuang did not care too much about the 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones but 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills were quite useful to him.

However, he was not very far away from Heaven Ultimate God Realm. He had managed to obtain 3,400 Divine Elixir Pills at one go earlier but probably only needed 2,000 of them for his breakthrough, hence it was still fairly easy for him to give away 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills.

Old Snake took the Interspatial Ring and made a rough calculation before nodding in approval.
