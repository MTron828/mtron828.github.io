Chapter 5272 - 5272: The Weak Have No Right to Choose

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This opportunity lay right in front of Si Tian.

After consecutive refusals, Jian Wushuang didn’t want to waste any more time; he laid his cards on the table.

If accepted, everyone would be happy!

If not, it would be settled later. Even if he left the Qishen Temple, he would travel through the Original Universe, searching for Si Tian and the components of the Beast God Weapon. He must obtain them.

No room for surrender.

From the old man with goat horns, he learned that Eternal Treasures were crafted by the peak experts of the ancient era. This belonged to the Emperor. Very few Universe Masters used Eternal Treasures; he used treasures from a higher level of the universe.

Treasures made from a universe itself.

Jian Wushuang didn’t fully understand their strength, but he grasped the concept of what a universe was.

As for the Beast God Weapon, it was crafted by slaughtering a Beast God who had mastered the origin source of the universe.

There were many universes, each with numerous universe lords, but true Beast Gods were rare.

In ancient times, there were only a few Beast Gods, and they were all killed by the Qishen.

It was built with the skeleton and flesh of a Beast God, with its innate universe origin source forming its soul.

“Beast God Weapon!’

This was the true Beast God Weapon.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Such a treasure, not to mention an Emperor, even Universe Masters went crazy trying to snatch it.

How could this not tempt him?

Even though it was incomplete, as long as they merged, giving birth to a trace of spatial origin source, even if it retained a fraction of its former power, it could allow Jian Wushuang to rampage through the Original Universe.

Eternal Treasures were desirable, but he lacked the endurance to possess them, let alone harness their power.

He could only rely on the few Eternal Treasures he had, the ones meant for defense, but even those were rare and not easily acquired.

Inside Qiuhuang City, there was only one such treasure, and it had ended up

in the hands of Wan Xing. It was a large seal, of little practical use to him.

The chance of obtaining replicated eternal treasures in the future depended entirely on luck, a factor Jian Wushuang had never heavily relied upon. His focus remained on the present; the distant future was too uncertain.

Sighing as if he had made a decision, Si Tian took a deep breath and spoke, “The weak may not have the right to choose, but when it comes to guarding one’s opportunities, I am confident.”

Jian Wushuang had mentally prepared himself for this response. If Si Tian had readily handed him the treasure, he might have been suspicious.

“Confirmed!” Jian Wushuang said playfully.

“To death, no regrets!”

They brushed past each other. Jian Wushuang headed towards the City Lord’s Mansion, ready to digest the spoils of this battle. When he returned, he would be stronger than ever before, a force not easily deterred by a mere artifact.

Even if he couldn’t obtain it, with the Candle Dragon Wings and the Candle Dragon Eye, he would be more than a match for an Emperor.

Jian Wushuang understood Si Tian’s lack of regrets, but he wouldn’t let this opportunity slip by.

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion, the plaques of the Four Halls were still prominent. Outside the halls, tens of thousands of Grand Yan Immortals had gathered.

These people all chose to retire, including some peak-level Grand Yan Immortals.

Jian Wushuang glanced over them without much thought.

This ninth wave of Devouring Demons had indeed caused them heavy losses.

Now, when everyone from the four main city walls was counted together, there were probably not even 50,000 people.

Yet here, more than 30,000 Grand Yan Immortals had gathered.

Among them, there were even peak-level Grand Yan Immortals who had gathered 100,000 treasure points, choosing to accept the top-tier inheritance and practice the Emperor’s supreme techniques.

There were also strong experts among the peak-level Grand Yan Immortals who had gathered tens of thousands of treasure points.

They all had promising futures!

Qiuhuang City was just an endpoint in the second phase.

Other top Grand Yan Immortals had also accumulated quite a few treasure points, enough to exchange for a top-tier inheritance at the very least.

It’s worth noting that these inheritances, at the lowest tier, included the Emperor’s supreme techniques.

Some had once accepted lower-tier inheritances, increasing their strength several times over. The Emperor’s supreme techniques they practiced were incredibly powerful, not weaker than those practiced outside with Emperor’s supreme techniques.

However, the lower-tier inheritances had all been exchanged for, leaving only a few top-tier ones.

Jian Wushuang was not very interested in these from the start and walked into the Treasure Hall on his own.

At this critical moment, it was crucial to focus on restoring his strength.

He had a premonition that the next ten waves would be crucial.

The previous nine waves were just minor disturbances, continuing to sift out the most powerful Grand Yan Immortals.

After entering the Treasure Hall, Qiuhuangs figure flew out of the pot, as usual, but his smile seemed warmer than before.

“Senior!” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly, his expression extremely respectful.

But Qiuhuang, sitting above, waved his hand dismissively, seeming indifferent.

“Alas!” Qiuhuang sighed. In his eyes, the strength of Jian Wushuang and Emperor Wan Xing could rival ancient Dao Ancestors, but he Zhen Ling held high hopes for a young monk named Hu Qing.

Zhen Ling didn’t hesitate to bestow upon Hu Qing the top-level inheritance and an Eternal Treasure, singling him out among thousands of inheritors.

Perhaps his perspective was narrow. He believed Jian Wushuangs strength, potential, and foundation were the strongest. When it came to combat power, there was a slight gap between Jian Wushuang and Wan Xing.

However, once the Beast God Weapon fully integrated and recondensed the spatial origin source, Jian Wushuangs combat power was no weaker than Wan Xings. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was still at the Nine Revolutions stage and had not yet completed the path of a Grand Yan Immortal.

Seeing Qiuhuangs sigh below, Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

Before he could speak, Qiuhuang said, “l see your injuries are quite severe. Did you come this time to repair your divine body and origin source?”

Jian Wushuang nodded respectfully. “I hope Senior can offer guidance.”

If he had to choose alone, he truly wouldn’t know what treasures were most valuable to exchange for.

Rustle!

Countless treasures appeared in the hall.

“Your divine body is already damaged; it’s somewhat troublesome!” Qiuhuang frowned slightly. His eyes moved, and soon he had a perfect set of matching solutions in mind.

“These treasures are most suitable for you!” Qiuhuang waved his hand, and a pile of extremely precious treasures flew towards Jian Wushuang. Each one had descriptions, and at a glance, Jian Wushuang understood the functions of these treasures.

Clearly, he knew the purpose of all these items, but when it came to putting them together, he was utterly clueless.

“The flesh of the Giant God Clan.”

Jian Wushuang stared at the towering mass of flesh, his mind shaken!

Although he didn’t know which specific clan the Giant God Clan referred to, he was certain that this mass of flesh was dug out from the body of an Emperor-level powerhouse.

“80,000 treasure points!”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

Currently, he had just over one million treasure points in total.

This was just one of the many treasures used to repair divine bodies. There were plenty more valuables, each worth tens of thousands of treasure points, adding up to a total of millions.

He couldn’t help but swallow hard, looking up at Qiuhuang.

Seated on the throne, Qiuhuang seemed to have sensed Jian Wushuangs confusion!

Spending a million treasure points to repair a divine body seemed excessive, even extravagant.

“Kid, don’t be hasty!’

Qiuhuang said calmly, “These treasures, used for repairing divine bodies, might seem wasteful, but they are not just for that purpose. They can also enhance your divine body..”
