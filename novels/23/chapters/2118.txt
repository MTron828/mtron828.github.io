Chapter 2119 Purple Exotic Beas

Supreme Four Doctrine, Nine Heaven God Doctrine …There was Sword Doctrine, Knife Doctrine, Spear Doctrine and whatever other doctrines there were.

Jian Wushuang could sense the Sword Doctrine he was an expert in most clearly and strongly.

He also could sense Spacetime Doctrine and the Reincarnation Doctrine.

“The purple exotic beast embodied everything. No matter Spacetime Doctrine or the Reincarnation Doctrine, what i will be seeing is the complete doctrine. This…” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath.

Unbelievable.

He felt that this purple exotic beast was unbelievable,

“Who made these twelve altars? What exactly is that exotic beast?” JIan Wushuang muttered to himself as he looked at the beast.

He was looking at the fundamental makeup of the beast and how the doctrine operated.

That was derivation, derivation using doctrine as a foundation.

He could clearly sense how a high form of power had been derived from The Power of Heaven Way.

The higher form of power was paramount to everything he knew.

No form of doctrine could compare to this new power.

Only through derivation could this power be formed from doctrine.

“Is that, Rules of Order?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself softly.

He felt the high form of power.

He understood how it had come about.

Without a doubt, they were the Rules of Order.

Just like Emperor Bai said, even though he sensed Rules of Order from the purple exotic beast, he could not perceive them. What a pity.

This had nothing to do with the ability to perceive. Even though the purple exotic beast contained Rules of Order, there was no way that one could perceive it. They could only experience it.

“Even though i could not perceive it, I could still benefit greatly if i understood the process. At least I know that in the future, I will have an idea of how to perceive the Rules of Order.” Jian Wushuang smiled contentedly.

After experiencing Rules of Order once, Jian Wushuang had started to study the doctrine within the purple exotic beast.

“Reincarnation Doctrine, Spacetime Doctrine and Sword Doctrine…. This exotic beast embodied everything and I perceived it…” Jian Wushuang smiled and made a decision.

He did not hoped to have a big break through and reach stage three or grasp Rules of Order on the altar.

He decided he should use this short amount of time to improve his Spacetime Doctrine, Reincarnation Doctrine and Sword Doctrine.

He would also use the pure energy to cultivate the second scroll of Immemorial Celestial Body!!

“My battle power has reached the brink of a stage two great emperor. As long as I improve my understanding of doctrine and successfully cultivate the second scroll of Immemorial Celestial Body, my battle power will be that of a stage three great emperor!!” Jian Wushuang thought as he clenched his fist.

He calmed down and started meditating.

At the same time, the other eleven emperor gods realised how magical this altar was.

“Unbelievable, this energy is so much purer than divine power. What is this mysterious energy? And that purple exotic beast, how could it embody all the doctrines?”

Emperor God Jue Xian sat on the altar as his eyes brightened like never before.

“This is the real big opportunity. This will probably be the biggest and last opportunity in my life. I can’t waste this.”

“Meditate! Spare no effort to meditate!!”

“Waste not a single second!”

…

“Back in the Ancient Past, they have incredible means. I wonder which almighty created this?Heaven Repairing Palace, it’s too amazing!”

Underworld God thought to himself.

“With the help of the altar, there is a high chance I will reach the realm of great emperor despite the short time I have. What is important is how strong I will be after i reach the level of great emperor!”

“There is no hurry, I will take it slowly.”

Underworld God was absolutely confident.

He was already very close to the realm of great emperor. All he needed was an opportunity which could be found everywhere within this Heaven Repairing Palace, which meant that it was almost confirmed that he would reach the realm of great emperor.

Emperor God Liu Guang, Elder Qian and every other emperor god on the altar realised the opportunity the altar provided. They were overjoyed.

Before long, they were concentrating on meditating and working towards the realm of great emperor.

They were different from Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang planned to use the Heaven Repairing Palace to raise his own fighting power and understand the doctrine.

The remaining emperor gods planned to use this opportunity to reach great emperor!!

The opportunity that Heaven Repairing Palace provided them with the conditions to do so.

All tha wa’s left was their own ability.

…….

Heaven Repairing Palace had only opened once since its discovery

This was the second time it had opened.

The amount of resources needed to open this palace was unbelievable, so even the Sanctuary Alliance found it hard to bear with.

Like for today’s opening, Sanctuary Alliance had used nearly sixty percent of the resources it had accumulated over the ages. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The remaining resources would not allow them to open this palace even if they wanted to.

Every time the Heaven Repairing Palace was opened, it would last for a month.

A month’s time was very short, hence the people within the palace gave it their all.

In a blink of an eye, three days passed.

Jian Wushuang, who sat on one of the altars in the darkness, opened his eyes,

“The purple exotic beast is beneficial for me. I meditated to all three of my doctrines: the Spacetime Doctrine, the Reincarnation Doctrine and the Sword Doctrine. I managed to have a break through for my Reincarnation Doctrine.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
