Chapter 1186: Peak Universe Master?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On a wasteland in the battlefield, something was going on.

Jian Wushuang, the Tang Emperor, Sunrise Sword Emperor, and the Void Temple Master were waiting patiently there.

Before long, the Samsara and Red Lotus Palace Masters had arrived as well.

Both of them had been wandering about in the battlefield. Previously, only their consciousnesses were present in the meeting at the Green Fire Palace. Now, they had come in person.

“All here.”

The Samsara Temple Master surveyed their surroundings before speaking up. “This time, all six of us Green Fire Palace Masters will strike in unison. I’ve also brought the five Universe Master level Puppet Fighters along with me. We definitely can crush the Gold Kingdom’s base in one blow and kill all of their experts!”

“Right,” replied the other Palace Masters as they nodded seriously.

The Green Fire Palace had come prepared for today’s battle. After all, the Palace Masters had wanted to get rid of their enemy’s base for a long time now, but they did not have any good opportunities to make use of.

“Jian Wushuang,” the Void Temple Master said as he looked toward him. “When you left the Green Fire Palace 1,800 years ago, you were already at Universe Master level. After all this time, with your talent, I believe that your skills have improved again, haven’t they?”

The other four Palace Masters also looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I did make some improvements,” replied Jian Wushuang with a solemn nod. “I believe I’m on par with the Red Snow King now.”

“What?” the five Palace Masters exclaimed, taken aback with shock.

Jian Wushuang had made the remark casually, but it had stirred the emotions of the Palace Masters greatly.

The Red Snow King possessed peak Universe Master battle strength, and amongst the five of them, only the Samsara Temple Master was confident of being able to handle him.

“Jian Wushuang only possessed the skills of an ordinary Universe Master 1,800 years ago.

“After only such a short period of time, he now has the battle strength of a peak-level Universe Master?

“How is this possible?”?they thought.

“Jian Wushuang, are you saying that you are already on the same level as the Red Snow King now?” asked the Samsara Temple Master, a hint of doubt in his voice.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang replied, nodding gravely.

This made the five Palace Masters even more surprised.

“Kid, I’m afraid you’re not very awre of the true strength of the Red Snow King. You just fought once with him on the battlefield, and he should have reserved some of his power that time. If he unleashes all of it, he would be stronger than any of us four,” the Tang Emperor said.

“I’m not too sure if he held back during that fight, but I’ve absolute confidence that I can match him currently. The outcome of a fight between us now will be hard to predict,” replied Jian Wushuang solemnly.

“Oh? You’re that confident?” remarked the Tang Emperor, a strange look appearing on his face.

He knew Jian Wushuang fairly well and understood that he was not prone to talking big. If he was so confident, it was probable that he indeed possessed that kind of strength. If that were the case, his rate of improvement was incredible.

“Jian Wushuang, since you’re that confident, why don’t the two of us have a friendly duel right now? What do the rest of you think?” the Samsara Temple Master began asking.

“That’s good. We can objectively gauge Jian Wushuang’s real strength in this way too,” said Red Lotus. She was the first to agree; she had absolute faith in his word.

“Even though we’re about to move against the Gold Kingdom, there’s no hurry. I want to witness a test of skills between both of you,” agreed the Sunrise Sword Emperor as well.

The Void Temple Master and Tang Emperor also nodded readily.

“How about you, Jian Wushuang?” asked the Samsara Temple Master as he looked toward him.

“Since you’re personally inviting me to a friendly duel, Samsara Temple Master, I’ll not refuse naturally,” replied Jian Wushuang with a slight smile.

He knew that the Palace Masters had agreed with the Temple Master because they were somewhat doubtful over his current strength.

He was not irritated by this fact.

“Please, Samsara Temple Master,” said Jian Wushuang with a small laugh. The Blood Mountain Sword was already in his hand.

“Be careful,” replied the Samsara Temple Master with a light laugh as well. A black flame soon appeared above his palm.

The fearsome heat generated by the black flame instantly turned the surrounding Void to ashes. Jian Wushuang could also acutely feel the terrible power of the flame.

Boom!

The Samsara Temple Master took the initiative to strike first. With a huge stride, he appeared before Jian Wushuang.

He formed a fist with his right hand and used it to strike at Jian Wushuang. Of course, it was also completely engulfed in black flames.

It was a simple and unsophisticated strike, but the power contained in it could give an ordinary Universe Master the chills.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed as power surged into his arm, the might of the Blood Mountain Sword also increasing.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Jian Wushuang unleashed the brutal Heaven’s Bane, and his sword smashed directly into the Samsara Temple Master’s fist.

Bang!

There was a huge sound as a huge wave of black flames began spreading toward the perimeter, instantly turning the Void into a sea of fire.

The Samsara Temple Master stumbled and was knocked backward by the impact of the blow. He took a while to stablize himself.

“Samsara Temple Master, I’ve already said that my current battle strength is no weaker than that of the Red Snow King. You don’t have to hold back,” said Jian Wushuang with a laugh.

He could see that the Samsara Temple Master was holding back, perhaps in fear of injuring him.

“Samsara, you’ll have to be careful. From the last blow, I can see that Jian Wushuang’s strength is not much lesser than yours. You have to be on guard, or else you’ll lose.” Red Lotus teased.

“Samsara, unleash your full might,” suggested the Sunrise Sword Emperor as well.

“Haha, now it seems as though I’ve been too arrogant. Since that’s the case, I’ll give it my best shot now,” said the Samsara Temple Master as he laughed loudly. At the same time, a jet black glove had covered his hand.

Boom!

He struck again, but this time with his palm instead of fist. Likewise, it was entirely covered with black flames and it came crashing down upon Jian Wushuang’s head like a huge black cloud.

The corners of Jian Wushuang’s lip curled up and he responded instantly with a chilly sword shadow. It pierced into the heart of the “black cloud”—the center of the Samsara Temple Master’s palm.

The huge power of the black cloud dissipated instantly.

“You neutralized my move so easily?” said the Samsara Temple Master with a look of surprise.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang struck again. This time, his move was hard to fathom, and it looked extremely casual.

It looked like a simple move, but when it shot out, it disrupted Spacetime and instantaneously appeared in front of the Samsara Temple Master.

“It’s very quick!”

The Samsara Temple Master stared at the strike.

“This move!” exclaimed the Sunrise Sword Emperor as his pupils shrank violently.

As a Universe Master-level expert that was most accustomed to using the sword, he realized that Jian Wushuang’s move could affect Spacetime.

“How could any form of swordsmanship affect Spacetime?” the Sunrise Sword Emperor could not help but marvel.

Bam!

The black flames covering the Samsara Temple Master moved and formed into a fiery dragon that wrapped around Jian Wushuang’s strike, causing the sword essence to completely dissolve.

Jian Wushuang took a huge stride, coming before the Samsara Temple Master.
