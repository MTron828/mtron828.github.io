Chapter 3710: Red Cloud World

“Since it’s a disaster, why are you so surprised?”

Jian Wushuang really did not understand.

Seeing this, Daoist Xuan God and the others looked at each other and smiled.

“My young friend, you may not know this, but the Red Cloud Mist Tide is indeed a disaster for Crimson Stone Mountain. However, under this disaster, there are also huge opportunities,” Daoist Xuan God said with a smile.

“Opportunities?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Red Cloud World is one of the biggest opportunities in Crimson Stone Mountain,” Daoist Xuan God said, “every time the Red Cloud Mist Tide appears, the Red Cloud World will reappear in the human world. At that time, all cultivators can enter the Red Cloud World and stay there for 10,000 years.

“And the Red Cloud World is full of endless opportunities and treasures. As long as you are lucky and have a certain strength, you can get these opportunities.

“Since the three great battlefields began to exist in this star area, the Red Cloud World of Crimson Stone Mountain has appeared many times. Under normal circumstances, the Red Cloud Mist Tide will only appear once every several hundred million years. Naturally, the Red Cloud World will only open once every several hundred million years. However, there is no set time. Sometimes, the longest time is eight hundred million years.

“Every time the Red Cloud World opens, countless experts from the various powers in this starfield will go crazy and venture into the Red Cloud World. Of course, many of them have obtained great fortunes there.

“For example, billions of years ago, there was a Ruler of principles. His strength was quite ordinary, but he was lucky enough to obtain a great fortune in the Red Cloud World. After staying in the Red Cloud World for 10,000 years, he immediately reached the Ruleric level. He also had a powerful secret art, and his combat power was comparable to that of top Rulers!

“There’s also someone who got a precious inheritance in the Red Cloud World. From then on, he soared to the sky and reached the top of this star area in just a few hundred thousand years. Then, he went to the depths of the universe to explore.

“Of course, these are all rare opportunities. Not only the Red Cloud World, but many other places in the three battlefields are hiding such great opportunities. However, those great opportunities contain great dangers, while the Red Cloud World is relatively easy to encounter. Moreover, the danger is smaller.

“However, in terms of true treasures...every time the Red Cloud World reappears in the human world, there will be a large number of universe true treasures emerging. For example, top-tier and Pinnacle universe true treasures, be it attack weapons, true treasure armor, domain type, suppression type, flying type, and so on, all of them are available. In addition, there are many of them. Even Supreme universe true treasures...

...... CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Every time the Red Cloud World reappears, during these 10,000 years, there will definitely be supreme universe true treasures emerging, and not just one, but a total of 10. Although most of them are attack weapons, true treasure armor, and other special types of supreme universe true treasures will also be present.

“For example, Heaven Ancestor’s axe, which is a supreme universe true treasure, was obtained from the last time the Red Cloud World appeared,” said Daoist Xuan God with a laugh.

“Haha, I was purely lucky that time. I just happened to come across a supreme universe true treasure appearing, and it just so happened that I could use it.” Heaven Ancestor laughed very proudly.

In terms of power, the heavenly clan was considered quite ordinary among the great beings at the Ruler Realm. Under normal circumstances, a low-level Ruler like him would not be able to use a supreme universe true treasure unless he had the support of a major power, however, the Heaven Ancestor was lucky enough to obtain a suitable giant axe in the Red Cloud World.

Hearing their conversation, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel excited.

As Daoist Xuan God had said, the great opportunities in the Red Cloud World were not very attractive to Jian Wushuang.

After all, those great opportunities were usually only available to those who were truly lucky. Under normal circumstances, it would be considered good enough for one person to obtain such a great opportunity in the Red Cloud World, Jian Wushuang did not think that he would be so lucky.

However, the supreme treasures that were born in the Red Cloud World in the past 10,000 years made Jian Wushuang’s heart flutter.

There were a large number of top-tier and peak-tier universe supreme treasures, and even 10 supreme universe Supreme Treasures!

Supreme universe Supreme Treasures, supreme treasures of that level, were enough for experts at the Ruler Realm to fight madly for them.

There were many great beings at the Ruler Realm in this star field, but none of them had a supreme universe true treasure. These Rulers were all eager to get a supreme universe true treasure that was suitable for them, just like Heaven Ancestor.

Normally, they roamed the three battlefields. Although there were many supreme universe true treasures in the three battlefields, only one could be born after a long time, unlike the Red Cloud World. As long as the Red Cloud World was opened…within 10,000 years, no less than 10 supreme universe true treasures would be born.

Who would want to miss such an opportunity?

It was no wonder that the great beings of the various powers in this starfield were so eager to see the Red Cloud World.

It was no wonder that Daoist Xuan God and the others were so excited and surprised.

The Red Cloud World was a great blessing to the Principles Masters of this starfield and the Rulers.

“My young friend, you are no weaker than an advanced Ruler now. However, although you have the Supreme Treasure Divine Sword that you got from the Sky Roc Ruler and the Mountain River Map and the Heaven Suppression Tablet that your master left for you, I’m afraid that you can’t control or use them now. The Supreme Treasure Divine Sword is still not enough for you,” said Daoist Xuan God.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He also understood that if he had the Divine Sword of Styx as his most powerful weapon and the map of mountains and rivers, he would be able to master the Heaven Suppression Tablet one day, it was definitely a very rich treasure.

However, his enemy came from the distant Devil Cloud Star, the Star Master.

The Master of the Devil Cloud Star was a Master of a second-level Astral World. He had a lot of resources, so he must have all kinds of treasures. He was much richer than Jian Wushuang.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang must find a way to get more supreme treasures. At the very least, he must have a decent supreme treasure armor?

“It’s definitely good news for us that the Red Cloud World has come out at this time. This means that we can get as many supreme treasures for you as possible in the next 10,000 years. When the Master of the Devil Cloud Star arrives, we will have a better chance of winning,” said Daoist Xuan God.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“By the way, Xuan God, there are countless opportunities and treasures in the Red Cloud World. I wonder if there are treasures like the Ice Heart Glazed Jade in the Red Cloud World?” Jian Wushuang asked.
