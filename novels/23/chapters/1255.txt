Chapter 1256: Personally Verify

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I said I’m a Universe Master. What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“No, nothing.” The white-haired elder shook his head repeatedly, realizing his gaffe. Then, he politely said, “Your Excellency, our Scarlet Island stipulates that experts who are Invincible Universe Masters and above must be verified by our Universe God, and then assigned by them, so please wait a little while here.”

“The Universe God will verify me personally?” Jian Wushuang asked with a strange look. “How long do I have to wait?”

“Our Universe God Fei Yu is in this city. I’ve already sent him a message. It will not be long before he arrives. I have to remind you that the temper of the Universe Gods is very eccentric. When he arrives, if the strength you show is not up to the level of Invincible Universe Master, it will anger Universe God Fei Yu,” the white-haired elder warned.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Then I’ll wait for a while.”

The white-haired elder instantly asked him to the side in a deferential manner.

In the corner of the city stood a grand black castle. In the core hall of the castle, two people sat face to face.

“Fei Yu, this matter depends on you.” A cold middle-aged man in black smiled slightly.

“Haha, no problem, Chen. Don’t worry about it,” the other man said with a laugh. He was a handsome young man, wearing a luxury robe, and he was Universe God Fei Yu and the owner of the black castle.

The middle-aged man was Universe God Chen, another Universe God of the Scarlet Island. He was a famous Universe God.

As they were talking, Universe God Fei Yu’s expression suddenly changed.

“What’s wrong, Fei Yu?” asked Universe God Chen.

“The recruitment office reported that there is a person claiming to be an Invincible Universe Master, and I have to come there to verify,” Universe God Fei Yu replied.

“An Invincible Universe Master?” Universe God Chen’s eyes lit up. “Invincible Universe Masters are rarer than Universe Gods, and they are very useful. They do everything Universe Gods cannot. Besides, there are not so many Invincible Universe Masters on the Scarlet Island. Therefore, every time an Invincible Universe Master comes, it is a good thing for us.”

“Indeed.” Universe God Fei Yu nodded and asked, “Chen, if you’re free, why not go there with me?”

“Okay,” Universe God Chen agreed.

Then they left the black castle and went to the recruitment office.

As soon as the two Universe Gods arrived at the recruitment office, their terrifying auras spread out, and the entire recruitment office went silent.

Besides Jian Wushuang, all the Holy Masters and Universe Masters who participated in the recruitment were in awe.

“He’s Universe God Fei Yu, and the other seems to be Universe God Chen!”

“The two Universe Gods came personally!”

“They must be here for Jian Wushuang.”

Many people in the recruitment office whispered.

“Universe God Chen?” Jian Wushuang took a glance at Universe God Chen.

He had already read the information on many powerful Universe Gods in the Dayu World, and he had recognized the two Universe Gods.

Among the two Universe Gods, Universe God Fei Yu had mediocre strength, barely reaching an advanced level of the First Heaven.

On the other hand, Universe God Chen was very formidable. It was said he had broken through to the peak of the First Heaven.

Also, Universe God Chen was skilled in swordsmanship.

With the arrival of the two Universe Gods, the white-haired elder came to them immediately and saluted respectfully.

“Who is the Invincible Universe Master that I have to verify?” Universe God Fei Yu asked directly.

Jian Wushuang immediately came to them and bowed slightly, “I’m Jian Wushuang. Greetings, Universe Gods!’

Although his words were humble, his manners did not reveal much awe.

It was because these two were only Universe Gods of the First Heaven. Even if Universe God Chen was at the peak of the First Heaven, he was not much stronger than him. Thus, they could not inspire his awe.

The two Universe Gods did not mind it.

Every Invincible Universe Master was a genius, and it was normal for a genius to be arrogant.

“Jian Wushuang, meaning your Sword Principles are unparalleled. You really have a good name. How about your Sword Principle?” Universe God Chen glanced at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“The recruitment office reported that there is a person claiming to be an Invincible Universe Master, and I have to come there to verify,” Universe God Fei Yu replied.

“Here?” Jian Wushuang asked in bewilderment, “How do I show it?”

The two Universe Gods exchanged glances, and then Universe God Chen took a step forward, and said, “Jian Wushuang, you’re good at Sword Principle, and so am I. So, I’ll be your opponent. Display your full strength. Don’t worry, I’ll control my forces and keep it at the level of ordinary Universe Master. I will be measured and will not hurt you.”

“Fight with you, Universe God Chen?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened with surprise.

He was a Universe God at the First Heaven, and he was skilled in Sword Principle.

It was a rare opportunity for Jian Wushuang to fight with such an expert.

“Then, please, Universe God Chen,” he said and cupped his hands towards Universe God Chen. Then, the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“Bring it on.” Universe God Chen stood where he was with an indifferent smile, but he did not even take out his sword.

Jian Wushuang sighed and squinted.?“Since he deliberately controls his forces and keep it at the level of an ordinary Universe Master, then I’ll only perform at the same level and fight with him relying on my swordsmanship!”?he thought.

Jian Wushuang did not intend to display all his strength.

His foundation was poor. If he revealed his full strength… as a Universe Master whose battle strength could be compared with that of the Universe God, it would be a little cocky.

However, he could deliberately control the power of his forces and only reveal his swordsmanship.

“Start.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up abruptly, and he violently stepped forward.

The moment he lifted his foot, a gust of wind burst out.

The overwhelming sword shadows were caught in the wind, forming a real sword storm, sweeping towards Universe God Chen.

It was the move of Spell of Disturbance that Jian Wushuang created.

However, Jian Wushuang did not launch the Soul Attack this time.

He totally counted on his swordsmanship.

“Your swordsmanship is interesting.”

Seeing the sword storm sweep over, Universe God Chen smiled slightly, used his fingers as a sword and swung directly.

“Break!”

Universe God Chen’s chilly voice echoed between heaven and earth, and a scarlet sword light surged and broke the sword storm in a flash.
