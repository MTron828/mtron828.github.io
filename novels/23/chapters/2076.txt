2077 Last Line of Defense

Seven of the nine war spirits had fighting powers equivalent to that of a top-tier stage one great emperor, while the remaining two had power equivalent to that of a stage two great emperor. It would be difficult for anyone to remain alive after thirty seconds of frenzy when they worked together to try to kill someone.

King Chen Xing exploited his powerful self-defense mechanism and barely survived.

He was skeptical that Jian Wushuang would have a stronger self-defense mechanism than him.

At the entrance of the Ancient Emperor Grave, Jian Wushuang was surrounded by the nine war spirits. The various Ancient Gods were shocked when he launched the attack. Instead of experiencing fear, Jian Wushuang was excited to fight these nine war spirits.

“He is courageous. Even though he knows that the nine war spirits are powerful, he still dares to fight them head on.” King Chen Xing smirked coldly and pitied Jian Wushuang.

As expected, even though Jian Wushuang showcased extraordinary fighting power, he was instantly at a disadvantage when the nine war spirits attacked. Not too long after, a war spirit landed a hit on him. Even though the war spirit was only at the power level of a stage one great emperor, that blow was enough to injure any great emperor.

However, Jian Wushuang just grunted and continued fighting.

It was as though that attack had had no effect on him.

“What?” King Chen Xing was stunned. The following scene made his irises constrict as he was shocked again.

When fighting the nine war spirits, Jian Wushuang did not even try to dodge the attacks. He simply attacked the war spirits in a frenzy.

He fought the nine war spirits alone without fear.

The attacks from the nine spirits, including those from the two war spirits who had the same power level as a stage two great emperor, would land on Jian Wushuang occasionally. However, there was no effect on Jian Wushuang as he continued with the onslaught.

His fighting power was at his peak, and there was no sign of any injury. Instead of weakening, his aura grew and became even stronger.

Ten seconds, twenty seconds….

In the blink of an eye, thirty seconds had passed.

Hum!

The nine war spirits who were attacking Jian Wushuang disintegrated into nothingness and a path was revealed.

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly and walked down this path.

The Ancient Gods outside the Ancient Emperor’s Grave.

Especially King Chen Xing.

“How is this possible?”

“My self-defense mechanism is my most powerful ability. But even I could barely survive for thirty seconds when attacked by the nine war spirits. How could a Sword Emperor be unharmed after that ordeal?”

“He fought the nine war spirits, alone, head on for thirty seconds and came out unharmed? Even after he suffered direct hits from the war spirits?”

“How can a self-defense mechanism be so powerful?”

King Chen Xing widened his eyes as surprise was written all over his face.

Jian Wushuang’s performance had exceeded his wildest imagination.

However, what he did not know was that Jian Wushang had fought thirteen stage two great emperors back in Three-Emperors World for an extended period of time.

What was the result?

He was unharmed.

On the other hand, those weaker great emperors among the thirteen were severely wounded.

On the other hand, the pressure that the nine war spirits gave Jian Wushuang was similar to that of the pressure the thirteen great emperors put on Jian Wushuang. Hence, he could handle the war spirits easily.

As for the self-defense mechanism that King Chen Xing was so proud of, Jian Wushuang had Perfect Chaotic Holy Body which was many times stronger.

Within the Ancient Emperor’s Grave.

Jian Wushuang followed the tunnel and walked forward and ran into a large, old door.

On the door, there was a sculpture of an odd exotic beast. It was infused with secret restrictions.

These secret restrictions were flowing as though they were alive.

This door was the entrance to the inside of the Ancient Emperor’s Grave.

Every million years, this door would open when the Ancient Emperor’s Grave opened itself to the rest of the world.

Just then, the door was closed as the time was not right. A general in black armor stood in front of the door. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The general was completely covered in black armor. Only his facial features could be seen. He was at least five meters tall and held a black spear. He stood like a statue, motionless, in front of the door. It was as though he had been there since the beginning of time. Jian Wushuang couldn’t sense any aura from this man.

Jian Wushuang looked towards the general in black armor.

Even though he couldn’t sense any aura from the general, he felt pressured the moment he laid eyes on him.

This pressure was on another level compared to King Chen Xing and Great Emperor Zi Xu, who were all stage two great emperors.

Outside the Ancient Emperor’s Grave, King Chen Xing and the audience, too, saw the general in black armor.

“This is the third and last line of defense my father set!” King Chen Xing thought as he clenched his fists.

Back then, he had entered the grave and managed to pass the first two levels: suppression using bloodline power and the nine war spirits.

In the end, he had met the general in front of the door.

Here, he had stopped and could not advance any further.

In front of the door.

The moment Jian Wushuang appeared, the general in black armor, who seemed to have stood motionless for all eternity, opened his eyes.

A flash of dim light, which was as fast as lightning, burst forth towards Jian Wushuang.

“The time for the grave to open has not come. None shall enter.”

“You there, leave this place immediately.”

The general in black armor said coldly.

All he did was ask Jian Wushuang to leave, contrary to the war spirits in the second line of defense who had tried to kill Jian Wushuang.

When the nine spirits appeared, they had attacked Jian Wushuang immediately and tried to kill him, though they failed.

“If I were to wait for this grave to open by itself, I would have to wait another seven hundred thousand years. I cannot afford to wait for such a long time. Sorry but I’ll have to enter forcibly.” Jian Wushuang smiled with absolute confidence.

Jian Wushuang stopped talking and attacked the general in black armor.

A terrifying aura burst forth and the general gripped his spear tightly when Jian Wushuang attacked.
