Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Roar!

The dispelled divine power filled the sky. Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng’s figures retreated from the hit.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t act recklessly. God Destroying King’s reflexes are very shocking. Although your martial art motion is creepy, it’d be too forceful to create an opportunity relying only on your martial art motion. Plus, he is highly skilled in using his spear. He’s fast and accurate, and he was unbelievably strong. If one were to be careless and got shot, he might lose his life instantly,” Duan Lingfeng said solemnly.

“Mm, I can tell,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

With only an instant of exchange, Jian Wushuang already knew why God Destroying King would be looked up to by countless Universe Gods.

His strength wasn’t merely on his absolute power of Extermination, it also included his skill in using a spear and his terrifying insight and reflexes.

God Destroying King’s insight enabled him to lock Jian Wushuang’s principal self among the eighteen shadows in an instant and his immediate reflexes allowed him to take action before Jian Wushuang.

In other words, his martial art motion against God Destroying King was totally useless.

“The two of you, come on and bring it up,” God Destroying King’s face was cold as he held the sword with one hand and looked at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng arrogantly. He had an overbearing manner.

“This is crazy,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold, “I’d like to see if you really have no weakness!”

Vroom. There was a crimson light that suddenly burst out of Jian Wushuang’s eyes like a crimson sun.

Eighteen Asura Hell descended!

“Dreamland?” God Destroying King’s eyes contracted and his body shivered as he roared, “Break! Break! Break!”

He uttered the word thrice.

God Destroying King had already shaken off the phantasmagoria.

But Jian Wushuang revealed a smile at the sight.

“God Destroying King’s consciousness strength is quite shocking. At least he is much stronger than Zi Dongwang, but he is at most about Xin Zhou’s standards. If I were to perform the secret skill of Tian Yuan with my all, I could definitely affect him,” Jian Wushuang quickly made up his mind.

“Let me try.”

Jian Wushuang’s figure moves and boundless divine power suddenly flowed towards his right index finger.

“Ancient God Fourth Finger… God’s Test!”

Jian Wushuang performed his strongest move again.

When he performed the same move earlier to fight against Zi Dongwang’s strongest unique skill, it was evenly matched.

Rumble. The dark gold hand appeared again. A dark gold finger that looked like it had extended from ancient times was pointing towards God Destroying King. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The power was earth-shattering.

“Humph, how can the light of a spark compete with the sun and the moon!”

God Destroying King looked at him in disdain. Then, the longspear in his hand suddenly let out a dragon roar. He waved and a total of nine golden dragon that contained extermination auras plunged out. The nine golden dragon almost instantly shattered the gold finger.

However, right at the moment when the gold finger collapsed completely, a ray of light burst out through the void.

The light was transformed from the God Killing Spear.

In God Killing Spear, it contained the secret of Tian Yuan which Jian Wushuang performed with his all.

Dang!

God Destroying King waved God Killing Spear casually and it flew aside. However, the soul attack hidden in the God Killing Spear heavily hit his consciousness.

“Huh?” God Destroying King’s facial expression suddenly changed.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with joy. He could clearly feel that God Destroying King’s aura had diminished sharply at that moment.

“Darkness Region.”

Boundless darkness suddenly enveloped him while Duan Lingfeng was the King of the darkness. His eyes had a chilly gleam. As his figure turned illusionary, he pierced through the void and appeared next to God Destroying King. On the crimson saber in his hand, there was a flow of crimson light.

“Massacre Shadow!”

Wow!

The swordlight glistened.

It was different from any other techniques that Duan Lingfeng had performed.

Not only was that stroke fast, but most importantly, the sharpness contained in the stroke as though it could cut through the entire heaven and earth.

There was a layer of crimson shadow in the void that was cut open.

God Destroying King’s eyes contracted. A terrifying aura condensed and he wanted to wield his spear.

Another dark light hit again and the soul attack within the dark light hit God Destroying King’s consciousness. It caused a pause in God Destroying King’s action and he couldn’t wield his spear in time. He could barely hold his spear before his body.

Dang!

The crimson shadow descended and a fierce power spread. God Destroying King’s body slouched and fell lower by a dozen zhang.

However, before he steadied himself, there were two figures that appeared on each of his sides.

“Crimson Night Arc Light!” Duan Lingfeng was like a statue of crimson rock. He wielded the saber in his hands and swung.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!” Jian Wushuang gave full play to his Sword Principle. Among this Sword Principle, it contained a strong soul attack.

The two of them, one on the left and one on the right, charged towards God Destroying King who was still falling.

They continued to press him.

The golden Bellicose Spear in God Destroying King’s hand was moving crazily. It swept, it stabbed, it slashed, and ferocious power swept across and fought against Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng vigorously.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

Metal clashing sounds were heard continuously as the universe roared.

In the insane massacre, the three of their powers exploded almost perfectly. Although God Destroying King was powerful, he seemed to be at a disadvantage as he endured the attack from both of them simultaneously at such a close distance.

In a few breaths, he was hit multiple times by both Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng’s remaining swordlight.

God Destroying King’s gaze was cold but there was anger raging in his heart.

“Go away!”

Hong!

A terrifying extermination aura erupted, just like a war beast that could ruin heaven and earth. The power struck fear in both Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng. They had no choice and they could only retreat. But as they retreated…

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang controlled his willpower and shot out God Killing Spear at lightning speed again.

God Destroying King blocked the attack of the divine spear easily but he couldn’t do anything about the soul attack contained in God Killing Spear.

Since the beginning of the fight, it was the fourth time he had been hit by Jian Wushuang’s secret skill of Tian Yuan.

Even though his consciousness was extremely strong, he couldn’t stand it but let out a groan. His face grew pale and his aura grew spiritless.

“Humph, I thought you’ll be able to endure it forever.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold but he scoffed, “God Destroying King is ridiculously strong. Regardless of attack, defense, speed, as well as his skill of using a spear, his insight and reflexes, they could be described as terrifying!”

“However, in terms of consciousness… although his consciousness is extremely strong, even if Xin Zhu were to give his all, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to him. However, my consciousness attack is much stronger than Xin Zhu’s!”

“Using his consciousness as a breaching point, we can fight against him with the two of us joining forces.”

“Duan Lingfeng, let’s go!”
