Chapter 2226 Execution

From his appearance to taking down Xie Yu, to the previous attacks, Jian Wushuang had never pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword for swordsmanship.At most, he had used the Blood Mountain Sword’s suppressive abilities to suppress Xie Yu.

Now, finally, Jian Wushuang was about to perform his sword skills.

His abilities were finally being revealed.

“Brother, I have a bad hunch about this, be careful,” the black-haired man stared at Jian Wushuang and said.

“Hmm,” the burly man nodded.

Jian Wushuang in front of them finally made his move.

A casual step, yet it contained endless Power of Spacetime and he appeared in front of the burly man.

Jian Wushuang casually swung his sword, like a child playing with a wooden stick.

It was soft, there was no strength to it at all.

It looked ordinary to the people watching.

And rightfully so. It was indeed a very ordinary, casual swordmove.

But such a casual swordmove can be drastically different in nature when done by Jian Wushuang.

Space could not hinder his sword at all.

The burly man’s face darkened but he dared not be reckless. He took his fiery axe and swung down, the endless sea of fire charging for the sword.

Dang!

It was a crisp sound. Jian Wushuang’s arm shook slightly, pulling back his Blood Mountain Sword. He twisted his wrist and held his sword horizontally, the body of the sword now forming a whip which was heading towards the burly man.

Jian Wushuang had trained in the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower for a millennium – he had achieved a new understanding of Sword Principle.

Now, his usage of swordsmanship was unpreceded.

To him now, not only the blade could be used to kill the enemy – the body, the handle... any part of the sword can be used.

The Blood Mountain Sword left a blood shadow in the Void and struck the burly man’s axe.

An overbearing power was passed over, enough for the burly man to grunt, almost causing him to let go of his axe.

After the sword move forced the burly man into a retreat, he could feel several wind-breaking sounds heading for him.

It was the black-haired man with his spear. His spear was as fast as a viper coming out of its hole, heading for Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang smiled. As he raised his Blood Mountain Sword, Jian Wushuang turned into a huge beast that could devour everything in its way. The beast was roaring as an overwhelming explosion of swordsmanship burst out.

Jian Wushuang held the sword with one hand and pierced it straight forward.

Instantly the huge beast pounced and dense, endless sword shadows decimated the black-haired man’s spear tactics.

The black-haired man’s face darkened and started to spin the spear like a fiery wheel.

Pap!

Pap!

Dang! Dang!

Continuous clashes were heard.

The dense, endless sword shadows were all blocked by the black-haired man’s spear.

The wild beast slowly disappeared.

But after it had disappeared, a figure took its place and appeared less than ten metres in front of him.

“Crap!” the black-haired man was shocked.

A scarlet sword light appeared in front of the youth’s chest, tearing through his defensive armour, crushing all his internal organs.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo...Sanguis Extremus style!

The black-haired man’s eyes dimmed before he could scream.

“Second brother!”

The burly man broke down immediately upon that sight.

“AHHHHHH!” The burly man let out a hysterical howl, his expression wild.

Faced with such endless rage, the sea of fire he was surrounded in turned crimson red.

The fiery mark between his eyebrows let out a dazzling light as well, and immediately mysterious patterns emerged from the mark and surrounded his body.

Covered by those mysterious patterns, the burly man looked savage.

“You will die for what you have done!”

The burly man looked at Jian Wushuang with murderous intent and strode over.

Hong long long~~~ An overwhelming aura had locked onto Jian Wushuang.

“He became stronger?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. “I guess he demonstrated some sort of secret skill at a very high cost, his powers bursting out to be almost Half Step Divine Demon levels. Shouldn’t be that easy here with the restrictions.” Jian Wushuang was right.

The burly man had indeed performed a powerful secret skill, but it’s side effects are astonishing.

Most importantly, he could only keep it up for three breaths.

Three breaths was the limit.

“Even with your secret skill, you only reached Half Step Divine Demon,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

As the burly man charged at him in a frenzy, Jian Wushuang greeted him directly without fear.

“Flaming axe!”

Hua!

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

Five axe shadows, each one cutting down with endless flame.

It was the same stunt, but this time he barely managed to perform five axe moves.

But five was his limit.

Jian Wushuang held the sword with one hand, and as the axe was coming for him, a sharp light flashed across his eyes.

Hu!

A wind strong enough to destroy everything around came.

The storm could tear Great Emperor experts apart.

But the storm was the beginning of Jian Wushuang’s sword move.

Like a storm!

It was Sword Principle Xuan Luo’s most powerful move – Blast Rainstorm.

As Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship improved, the power of the Sword Principle Xuan Luo started to surface as well.

Along with Jian Wushuang’s current Chaotic Divine Demon power...

Hua!

The sword light flashed past mercilessly.

The sea of fire was cut into two.

As for the five axe shadows, under the sword light... Peng!

Peng!

Peng! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Peng!

Peng!

There were five impacts and the burly man’s battle axe was thrown away.

“How is this possible?” The burly man’s eyes were wide open in astonishment.

But the sword light was already in front of him, the endless storms flooding around him.
