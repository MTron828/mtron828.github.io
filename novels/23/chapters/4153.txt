Whoosh!

Qing Xuzi’s godly sword was like a venomous snake that suddenly slithered out at an unbelievable speed.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank. He raised the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand and blocked the sword.

Clang!

The two swords collided, creating a violent storm that swept in all directions.

The void under Jian Wushuang’s feet exploded.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly let out a roar and the divine sword in his hand swept across the void in a beautiful arc like a peacock spreading its tail.

Swish! Swish! The sword will was unleashed without restraint. With the support of the original universe and the dragon-destroying secret skill, the power of the sword was instantly boosted to its maximum.

Qing Xuzi also unleashed his full power.

However, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword principle was not inferior to Qing Xuzi’s. In terms of comprehension of universe principles, Jian Wushuang was even better than Qing Xuzi.

The only thing that Qing Xuzi was stronger than Jian Wushuang was that he was an unparalleled existence among the Ultimate Rulers. After he performed the secret skill, he had extremely powerful divine power.

However, after Jian Wushuang performed the dragon-destroying secret skill and the original universe, the power of the divine power was immediately wiped out.

Jian Wushuang was not much inferior to Qing Xuzi in terms of divine power. Naturally, Jian Wushuang could fight with Qing Xuzi face to face.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Shocking rumbles and collision sounds reverberated in the void of Fengyang Canyon. The many Ultimate Rulers who were watching the battle were stunned when they saw this scene.

“A fourth-stage great Ruler is actually evenly matched with Qing Xuzi?”

“Who is this fourth stage chief Ruler?”

“Where did this person come from? How can his combat strength be so terrifying?”

Everyone was in disbelief at this scene.

A fourth-stage chief Ruler was no different from an ant to these Ultimate Rulers.

Normally, they could easily slaughter a large group of fourth-stage great Rulers with a wave of their hands. But today, a fourth-stage great Ruler had Actually fought with Qing Xuzi, who was an Ultimate Ruler and had invincible combat strength!

They could see that Qing Xuzi had already used all his strength, but he still could not do anything to his opponent. He could not even gain the upper hand in the battle.

Such combat strength had completely exceeded their imagination.

“Impossible!”

“This is impossible!”

Qing Xuzi was also shocked and furious.

To be evenly matched with a stage four great Ruler was definitely the greatest humiliation he had ever experienced in his life!

What he did not know was that Qing Xuzi had already given his all, but Jian Wushuang still had some trump cards that he had not used. For example, he had not used his innate super power, life shock.

However, his only task was to keep Qing Xuzi busy. He did not have to risk his life.

Moreover, the time of ten breaths was almost up.

Suddenly, he was startled.

“Let’s go!”

An explosive roar resounded through the void.

“What?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over and saw that the Ninth Kalpa King had already put the Supreme divine medicine into his bag. He had also rescued Divine Marquis Qingfeng, whose divine body was on the verge of collapse, from the five Blood Nether Emissaries and was rushing toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. Since the Ninth Kalpa King had already obtained the Supreme divine medicine, there was naturally no need for him to fight to the death with Qing Xuzi.

The next moment.

The Ninth Kalpa King arrived, picked up Jian Wushuang, and rushed into the distance.

With his speed, even if he took both Marquis Qingfeng and Jian Wushuang with him, none of the Ultimate Rulers could catch up to him.

The three of them would be able to escape unscathed.

However, at this moment.

Ninth Kalpa King, die!!

A strange figure appeared in the surrounding void without any warning. It was none other than the Ruler Silver Roc.

The Ruler Silver Roc had a grudge against the Ninth Kalpa King. He had been waiting in the surrounding void for the perfect opportunity to strike a fatal blow on the Ninth Kalpa King.

And now, this perfect opportunity had finally come. A golden spear appeared in his hand. At the tip of the golden spear, drops of purple-black venom dripped down, burning the void into poisonous smoke.

“Go!”

The Ruler Silver Roc’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. He aimed at the Ninth Kalpa King’s back and threw the halberd!

In an instant, this golden spear actually leaped in the void. With a shuttle, it had already arrived at the back of the Ninth Kalpa King and ruthlessly stabbed in!

Clang!

The golden spear hit the armor on the surface of Ninth Kalpa King’s body and made a sound of metal hitting metal. However, the tip of the Golden spear did penetrate the armor and entered his divine body.

The Ninth Kalpa King’s body trembled, but he did not turn back. Instead, his divine power burst out and he swept forward at an even faster speed.

In the blink of an eye, the Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng had fled a thousand miles away and disappeared from Fengyang Canyon.

…

Inside the Fengyang Canyon.

Prince Zhennan’s red robe was in tatters, and his hair was disheveled. He was in an extremely sorry state. Five of the seven divine armor guards that had followed him had died in battle, and the remaining two were barely hanging on. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qing Xuzi’s face was livid and gloomy.

Among the three forces, only those from Blood Sky Palace were calm.

Among the five blood messengers, a thin one glanced at Lord Zhennan and Qing Xuzi and said coldly, “One bragged about how powerful he was every day and took the initiative to challenge the Ninth Kalpa King. In the end, he was beaten so badly that he couldn’t even fight back. The other couldn’t even deal with a Ruler of the fourth level. What a waste.”

“You!” Qing Xuzi and Lord Zhennan’s expressions changed drastically.

“What’s wrong? You still want to fight?” The five Blood Nether Emissaries sneered with contempt.

Lord Zhennan took a deep breath. If he was at his peak, he would not be afraid of the five blood nether messengers. However, he was now seriously injured, and it would not be good for him to attack now.

“What about you guys? The five of them couldn’t even kill Divine Marquis Qingfeng, how strong can they be?” The Lord Zhennan sneered and retorted.

“What did you just say?” The five Blood Nether Emissaries narrowed their eyes at the same time and shot out cold lights.

“That’s enough, the three of you. Now is not the time to argue. Are you going to watch as the Supreme divine medicine is taken away?” Right at this moment, the hawk-nosed, black-robed Ruler Silver Roc walked over.

“Eh? They’ve already escaped. Do you still have a way?” Lord Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, and the Blood Nether Emissary all looked at the hook-nosed man.

The Ruler Silver Roc laughed, “That Ninth Kalpa King was hit by my spear. He can’t run far. My spear not only contained poison that could kill a peak-Level Ultimate Ruler, but it also left an origin mark.”
