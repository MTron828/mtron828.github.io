Chapter 3021: Slaughter

——

Hearing Lord Wu’s words, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were all jolted awake.

Indeed, the other party could easily kill a rank two True Saint and even slash His Highness the Gold King from hundreds of meters above the ground. Such terrifying combat strength was not something an ordinary rank one True Saint could compare to.

“Let’s attack together!”

“With so many of us attacking together, he must die!”

“Kill him!”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom reached an agreement. In the next moment, dozens of figures moved at the same time.

There were 32 people who attacked at the same time.

All 32 of them were True Saint experts.

As for the False Saints, they did not attack. After all, their strength had reached Jian Wushuang’s level. An ordinary False Saint could not interfere at all. Moreover, a False Saint did not have an immortal body. If they really rushed forward, they would be courting death.

But even without these False Saints, the 32 True Saints alone were already very terrifying.

Among the 32 True Saints, there were three rank-three True Saints, including Gold Mountain Realm Master, River True Master, and Lord Wu. There were eight rank-two True Saints.

Together with Gold King, an expert close to the peak of rank three True Saint, this lineup was enough to scare people to death.

But at this moment, all of them attacked, and all of them were aimed at Jian Wushuang.

“They all attacked?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, and the 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom behind him also looked down at everything in the world with a rich golden light in its eyes.

“Humph, you want to kill me?”

“I want to see who will kill who!”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly and moved instantly.

The moment he moved, a large amount of the power of space-time rules swept up, and Jian Wushuang’s figure reached its peak in an instant.

“He is very fast, and his movement is very strange. Everyone, be careful!” Gold King warned in a low voice.

He had fought with Jian Wushuang before, and he had personally experienced Jian Wushuang’s speed. Naturally, he knew how amazing Jian Wushuang’s speed and his movement were.

However, although he had reminded them that Jian Wushuang was fast enough and that the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were on their guard, they were still shocked when Jian Wushuang’s speed and movement technique burst out.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

One after another, silver light flashed in the void.

The speed of the silver light was so fast that the True Saints could barely see a silver shadow, but they could not see where Jian Wushuang was.

“His speed…”

“How can he be so fast?”

“Where is he? where is he?”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom immediately exclaimed.

Gold King’s pupils constricted. “His speed is even faster than when he fought with me?”

Gold King did not know that Jian Wushuang had been holding back his strength during the fight, not only in terms of divine power and power but also in terms of speed and movement skills. However, even though he had held back, his speed was still much faster than Gold King’s.

And now, his speed and movement skills were completely revealed.

Whoosh!

Silver light flashed and appeared in front of a rank two True Saint in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom without any warning.

The rank two True Saint had just raised his head when he saw an ice-cold and gorgeous sword shadow suddenly lighting up.

Space-time swordsmanship…Star Dream!

Chi!

The sword shadow directly passed through the neck of the rank two True Saint and then flew out from the other end.

“No!”

The rank two True Saint let out a shrill cry. He felt that his divine body had collapsed, and his divine power was being crazily eroded by a terrifying power, which was the god-burning poison.

Under the erosion of the god-burning poison, his divine power had no room to resist at all. In a moment, it was completely eroded, and he died on the spot. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But that was not what was truly terrifying.

After Jian Wushuang’s Star Dream move swept past the neck of the rank two True Saint, the power of the sword shadow did not weaken. Instead, it continued to fly toward the other two rank-one True Saints.

Chi! Chi!

The same scene happened. The two rank-one True Saints died on the spot. They did not even have time to scream.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed and disappeared again.

With a flash of silver light, he appeared on the other side…

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The sound of swords entering one’s body rang out one after another. The silver light flashed in the void, and sword shadows crisscrossed among the heavy experts.

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were like fools. They stood there in a daze as if they were at the mercy of their opponents.

In fact, it was not because they were stupid, but because Jian Wushuang was too fast and his movements were too strange. They had no idea where he was.

Naturally, they could only be swept by the sword shadows one by one.

“Oh no!”

“Retreat, retreat quickly!”

Lord Wu had already reacted in time and shouted at the first moment.

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom reacted quickly. The moment they heard Lord Wu’s shout, they immediately retreated at their fastest speed.

In just an instant, these experts had already left the battlefield and returned to the place where they had previously watched the battle.

However, when they returned here, they discovered…that there had originally been a total of 32 True Saints. Including Gold King, there had been a total of 33 True Saints who had charged out at the same time. However, in just an instant, the entire process had taken less than two breaths! Now, there were only 16 of them!

Yes, 16!

Half of them were gone!

And that half of them had been killed by Jian Wushuang in that instant!

“How, how could this be?”

“Monster, he’s a monster!”

“It’s too terrifying. His speed is too terrifying. We couldn’t react in time.”

“In just an instant, in just a single exchange, we didn’t even have time to react. He actually slaughtered all sixteen of us True Saints? If it wasn’t for Lord Wu telling us to retreat in time, wouldn’t all of us have been slaughtered by him?”

The surviving True Saints, including the many False Saints who had been watching the battle, felt their minds go blank.

It was as if they had been struck by lightning.

There was nothing they could do. The scene just now was too terrifying.

The True saints who were lucky enough to survive had also made a trip to the gates of Hell.

They could not believe that if they had been a little slower, they would also have been killed by Jian Wushuang’s sword?

At the front of the experts, Gold King and Lord Wu stood side by side, their faces gloomy to the bottom.

Gathering 33 True Saint experts to surround and kill one person, only to be instantly slaughtered by the other party. No one could accept such an outcome.
