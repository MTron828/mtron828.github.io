Jian Wushuang's realm was now beyond the discernment of even a tier 5 Emperor.

Even a tier 6 Emperor could only make a rough estimation.

Although Kun Tai couldn't discern Jian Wushuang's realm, he understood that at most, Jian Wushuang was only a peak-level tier 4 Emperor, not yet a tier 5 Emperor.

Facing a top-level tier 5 Emperor, he forced him to burn his Origin Source and divine body, which was indeed extraordinary.

Perhaps only the legendary Inheritors could achieve such feats.

Kun Tai had encountered extraordinary Emperors in the Earth Realm before. The Crown Prince, Luo Sha, was quite remarkable, being able to contend with ordinary tier 5 Emperors at the limits of tier 4.

That was already quite extraordinary.

However, Jian Wushuang far surpassed Luo Sha. He hadn't even reached the limit of Dao Lord yet!

The limit of Dao Lord required his Sword Dao and Extreme Dao to reach the ninth level.

Currently, he could already engage in battle with a top-level tier 5 Emperor and force him to burn his Origin Source and divine body.

Although a significant reason for this was Kun Tai's reluctance to fight him and the desire to pursue Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang, it also indicated that Kun Tai posed no immediate threat to him.

Otherwise, Jian Wushuang could have directly killed him.

Jian Wushuang stood with his hands clasped, calmly uttering a single word, "Please."

The character for 'restrain' had already transformed into a tangible form. He was inviting Kun Tai into the vortex.

The swirling vortex of the Swirling Sea was pitch-black, resembling a gap in the world.

¬†The more Jian Wushuang looked, the more he resembled a black hole. This indicated that he was not far from the realm of a black hole.

When he just emerged, his sword was trembling, showing its connection to the Dao of the sword.

This time, the battle was perhaps the dual catalyst for his breakthrough in Sword Dao and the Extreme Dao.

Suppress!

Kill!

Jian Wushuang suddenly made a move, without any hesitation.

In his own universe, he had sufficient confidence, with his divine body ascending and the Origin Source burning.

It wasn't only others who could burn; he could too.

Moreover, he directly burned 30 percent.

With the blessing of his universe, his strength had already multiplied several times, and with the burning of the Origin Source, his combat power directly approached that of tier 5 Emperor.

Though the enemy was formidable, they were within his universe.

The ancient longsword in his hand, simple and unadorned, resembled a dragon as it roared towards Kun Tai.

Kun Tai raised an eyebrow, surprised that Jian Wushuang would take the initiative, aligning with his intentions.

Accompanied by the thrust of a spear made of purple thunder.

The purple thunder serpent met the dragon.

The struggle of their divine forms represented their clash.

The dragon moved gracefully, like a startled swan, resembling a wandering dragon.

Its killing power became even more formidable, while the purple thunder serpent was exceedingly fierce, with lightning bolts suppressing the dragon, forcing it to evade in all directions.

The might of Jian Wushuang's Origin Source was incredibly powerful ‚Äì if one path didn't work, there were two, three, or even ten thousand paths.

Kun Tai was dumbfounded, realizing that the battle of spell figures was a competition of Origin Source.

He had never imagined that Jian Wushuang's Origin Source would be so powerful.

"This is an illusion!" Kun Tai still didn't believe it, holding his spear to break the illusion and charging straight ahead.

It seemed that these seasoned warriors, who often engaged in battles, liked to use spears.

The Grand Yan Immortals encountered at Great Desolate Wilderness were similar.

But now, he faced a tier 5 Emperor, a pinnacle existence in the Original Universe.

Although the Emperors in the Four Great Secret Realms were relatively weaker, they had many treasures!

The purple spear in Kun Tai's hand pierced, prodded, and swept away, breaking one by one through Jian Wushuang's illusions.

Kun Tai, who hadn't had time to be surprised, realized that these illusions were real.

Fortunately, their power was average, and he could still sweep through them.

With so many illusions to deal with, Jian Wushuang's Origin Source was also weakening, achieving only the effect of blocking.

It was enough. As long as he could delay them and allow Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang to escape, it would be sufficient.

He had no intention of directly confronting Kun Tai.

Jian Wushuang felt a bit itchy watching this.

These dragons wouldn't hold out for long. Under the rapid decline of his abundant Origin Source, this method was not profitable.

If he continued to kill like this, his Origin Source would quickly be depleted.

Looking at Kun Tai, who was getting more and more excited, Jian Wushuang thought of his physical body, the original skeleton he had chosen. That was the real him.

The limit of the physical body, refined ten times, with even the Origin Source injected into the bones.

Today, he would test the power of his physical body to see how strong it really was.

There was also his divine body, burning and already approaching 30,000-fold.

The basic divine body was 15,000-fold, almost doubling.

With a divine body of 30,000-fold, if stable, it might be possible to fight a tier 5 Emperor.

Many tier 5 Emperors also had divine bodies around 30,000-fold.

Moving up, the required treasures were not for sale; they had to be exchanged with equivalent value, a cost beyond the means of ordinary people.

But to become more powerful, a tier 6 Emperor couldn't follow the path of Origin Source in the Great Dao; they would all lean towards the divine body route, and cultivating dual forces enhanced their survival capabilities.

While the Origin Source diminished rapidly, the divine body continued to solidify. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

The Sword Dragon could no longer resist; Jian Wushuang took a step back and reappeared at the edge of the One Thought Universe.

Here, his speed increased even more.

He held the long sword, and the Eye of the Candle Dragon on his forehead flickered.

Beast God Domain!

Not only did it amplify his divine body, but the power of the Candle Dragon Eye was also formidable.

The towering Beast God crawled out of the vortex.

Jian Wushuang retracted the sword, and his physical body transformed into its original form.

It was the appearance of a Special Life Form with smooth and transparent skin, ear grooves, slender eyes, a high nose, and pale red lips.

Completely white, smooth-headed without a strand of hair.

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and once again approached Kun Tai.

His body was now covered in black armor and Candle Dragon Wings.

"Today, let me show you what it looks like when the physical body reaches its limit!" As he spoke, the Beast God that crawled out of the vortex roared.

Candle Dragon!

Today, he would completely merge the Origin Source into the Beast God Weapon and comprehend it thoroughly.

Kun Tai also smiled, putting away the spear in his hand.

Hand-to-hand combat!

Whoosh!

As a tier 5 Emperor and a general of the Mo Luo Nation, with a divine body amplification of 25,000-fold and having cultivated a divine body supreme technique that could reach around 30,000-fold, he barely met the normal standard for a tier 5 Emperor.

Even if a tier 5 Emperor were extremely poor, investing all resources in the Origin Source path could still push the divine body to over 20,000-fold. Clearly, Kun Tai had done just that.

However, his Origin Source was too weak, significantly lagging behind Jian Wushuang.

A tier 5 Emperor couldn't compete with a Dao Lord in spatial ability; if he knew, he would probably be infuriated.

Jian Wushuang's arms swayed slightly. Who didn't have a unique technique?

Heavenly Demon Art!

This technique was quite famous, and Kun Tai recognized it.

Six Arms!

Kun Tai breathed a sigh of relief, but next, he was dumbfounded. Whether his eyes were playing tricks on him or not, he saw countless arms behind Jian Wushuang.

Those were the Thousand-Armed Guanyin of the Buddhist Sect.

It was a supreme technique from the Buddha Realm, seemingly created by an extraordinary Buddha.

Jian Wushuang didn't know who it was, but he had seen the head monk use it. After a bit of research, he found that it complemented the Heavenly Demon Technique quite well.

Hum!

Eight-Armed Heavenly Demon!

Eight arms, each controlling a palm, radiating eight dazzling rays of light.
