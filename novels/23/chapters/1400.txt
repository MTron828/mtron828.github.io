Chapter 1401: Supreme Tower!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The disciples on Titanic Star were chatting casually. They did nothing to conceal their conversation and Jian Wushuang heard them clearly.

Jian Wushuang looked cold and he couldn’t be bothered with their conversation so he walked into the wormhole straight away.

Vroom.

There was a flash of light and Jian Wushuang appeared in a dark palace. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The palace was extremely spacious. He couldn’t see the end of it with his naked eyes.

In the middle of the palace, there were three figures standing in line. The three of them hold a saber each.

“War puppet?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the three tall, sturdy figures before him, “The three training places in Lineage of Star, I’ve tried Star Tower and Illusionary Mind Sea but I’ve never tried Supreme Tower before.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The three figures moved simultaneously. They took one step and appeared before Jian Wushuang instantly. Then, they slashed.

The three swords descended at the same time.

Jian Wushuang stood there but he didn’t block with his sword. There was a surge of Soul Power that flowed out and suddenly gathered to become a black tortoise. It covered Jian Wushuang’s body and performed its terrifying defense power.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

The three slashes were blocked by the black tortoise shell. At the same time, the counter impact sent the three war puppet backwards.

“How could the attack power of the three war puppets be so weak?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

However, Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows again very soon.

“That’s not right, their power is increasing constantly!”

“I see. The power of the war puppet would have increased along with the passing of time. No wonder the longer one stays in Supreme Tower, the more powerful one is.”

Jian Wushuang understood and his Soul Power swept out the next moment. It then formed into three Soul thorns and shot towards the three war puppets.

The three Soul thorns flew through the war puppets’ bodies without any hindrance, but it didn’t have any effect on the three war puppets.

The three war puppets continued to charge towards him at a terrifying speed.

“My opponents are war puppets and they are dead. They don’t have any consciousness. My Soul Attack has no effect on them at all,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

What he was good at wasn’t swordsmanship and close combat power, but Soul Attacks.

However, in Supreme Tower, in a situation where his opponents were war puppets, he was obviously at a disadvantage. A major disadvantage.

“My magic and any other attack that aims at spirit or consciousness are useless. I can only depend on Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack to do consolidated attack,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were giving out electric sparks and he waved his hands. Roar.

An earth-shattering roar was heard, then there were three huge purple tigers that charged towards the three war puppets like lightning.

…

On Titanic Star, the disciples were waiting in silence.

In the Milky Way, Hall Master Yuan and the dozen deacon elderlies were waiting as they focused on what was happening in Supreme Tower.

Although there wasn’t any image, the deacon elderlies could see what was going on in Supreme Tower clearly.

At that very moment, the deacon elderlies looked surprised.

“A consciousness Attack? Such a strong consciousness attack!”

“Among Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in Lineage of Star, there is one who is good with consciousness attacks?

“He is very impressive in performing the consciousness attack.”

The deacon elderlies were all powerful Real Gods. Everyone had great foresight and they could tell that Jian Wushuang was giving play to an unusual consciousness attack.

However, they didn’t recognize that it was Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

“This young man is Jian Wushuang who Lei Bao brought back not long ago, right?” The deacon elderlies looked at Lei Chao.

“It’s him,” Lei Chao nodded.

“I thought that the young man was extremely weak and didn’t qualify to be a disciple of Star Palace? But now…”

The deacon elderlies had a strange look.

Previously, Jian Wushuang’s matter had stirred a commotion in Lineage of Star. Many deacon elderlies were shocked and there were even deacon elderlies that suspected before.

Dealing with the suspicion, Hall Master Yuan didn’t explain much and merely told them to judge by the outcome of the battle. Then, the matter was brushed off.

But then, Jian Wushuang’s power showed in Supreme Tower had exceeded their expectations.

“Everyone might not know that Jian Wushuang passed through the nineteenth floor in Illusionary Mind Sea few days ago,” Hall Master Yuan said with a smile.

“Nineteeth floor?

“Doesn’t it mean that his consciousness strength has reached the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven?”

The deacon elderlies were dumbfounded, and then they understood why Jian Wushuang was qualified to be a disciple of Star Palace.

Time flew past and Jian Wushuang walked out from Supreme Tower soon.

When he appeared on Titanic Star, the surrounding disciples looked at him with astonishment.

“Seventeen breaths?”

Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Supreme Tower for seventeen breaths?”

“Seventeen breaths already surpassed most of the disciples. As for the duration in Supreme Tower, he should be on the eleventh!”

“Eight hundred years ago he was at the bottom among all ordinary disciples. But now, he is at the eleventh?”

The disciples found it unbelievable.

Of course, there were people who didn’t care.

Such as the four disciples of Star Palace, such as Luo Quan, Lu Han, and a few top ordinary disciples, who couldn’t be bothered.

“Seventeen breaths, not too shabby. Unfortunately, he won’t even have a chance to join the second round,” Luo Quan smirked.

“Jian Wushuang has improved quite greatly within the eight hundred years,” Lu Han stole a glance at Jian Wushuang but sneered, “However, he only stayed in the tower for seventeen breaths while I stayed in the tower for eighteen breaths. I am stronger than he is. Among all the disciples that participated, I am at the tenth. If there’s no surprises, I will be among the ten disciples who join the second round. As for Jian Wushuang… on the eleventh, he will be eliminated.”

The ten disciples who joined the second round of rotation battle were normally foreseen according to the duration they stayed in Supreme Tower.

The duration he had stayed in the tower was longer than Jian Wushuang. Hence, he naturally thought that he definitely would be joining the second round of rotation battle, rather than Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang, there were a few disciples who also got into the tower. Very soon, all fifty-two Universe Gods in the Second Heaven went through the tower.

Next, Hall Master Yuan and the deacon elderlies discussed in the boundless Milky Way and then went to announce the results.
