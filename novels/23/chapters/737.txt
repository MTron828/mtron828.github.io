Chapter 738: Imperial Kinsmen!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Following Elder Ying, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the core place of the palace—a huge black pavilion.

On the stairs in front of him, he saw a weathered elder sit with his legs crossed and eyes closed.

If someone observed the elder just by looking, he would think that this man was not breathing and was dead, but if he closed his eyes and tried hard to feel the elder’s aura, he would know that the elder was alive.

“Elder Yi.” Elder Ying bowed to the elder respectfully.

The elder heard the voice and opened his eyes.

As the elder’s eyes fell on Jian Wushuang, the latter immediately felt his mind go blank.

For a moment, Jian Wushuang felt as if he was frozen inside out.

“What’s wrong with me?”?He could not help being afraid.

“Three-star Ancient God!

“This elder must be a Three-star Ancient God, as powerful as a Dao Master.”?

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were widely opened.

This was the first time that he had seen such a supreme expert.

Although the elder was an Ancient God, not a human being, Jian Wushuang knew that the elder was no weaker than a human Dao Master and might be even stronger.

He was so thrilled that such a powerful god was now sitting before his eyes.

“How could this boy’s bloodline be even stronger than mine?”

The elder was surprised after staring at Jian Wushuang, and he immediately asked, “Boy, who are you?”

He looked impassive, his piercing eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang as if he wanted to see through him.

Being watched by such a pair of intense eyes, Jian Wushuang felt timid, but he was experienced so he managed to remain calm while replying, “I’m Jian Wushuang.”

“Jian Wushuang?” On hearing the answer, the elder narrowed his eyes.

“Elder Yi, this boy is a descendant of Militant Warriors’. A few days ago, he accepted a baptism in the Baptismal Pool with our clansmen and didn’t get out until seven days and six nights later.” Elder Ying chimed in.

“Seven days and six nights?” Elder Ji had a surprised look on his face upon hearing the words.

Normally, staying in the Baptismal Pool for two days and two nights would be enough to awake the bloodline of a Gold-armored Ancient God.

At that moment, Elder Ying continued, “More than that, the Gold-armored Ancient God he transformed into was about 15 meters tall and had dark gold skin on his chest while the skin of other parts was pure gold.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Dark gold?”

On hearing this, Elder Yi suddenly rose up to his feet and watched Jian Wushuang closely while shouting, “You just said that the Gold-armored Ancient God this boy transformed into was about 15 meters tall and had dark gold skin on his chest?”

“Yes.” Elder Ying nodded.

Elder Yi was vacant-eyed with astonishment, murmuring, “Dark Gold Ancient God… Imperial Bloodline!”

“Imperial Bloodline?” When Elder Ying heard the two words, she was dumbfounded.

Jian Wushuang was, however, confused.

“What does Imperial Bloodline mean?

“Is he talking about me?

“There are only copper-armored Ancient Gods, Silver-armored Ancient Gods, and Gold-armored Ancient Gods, aren’t there?”?

Lost in confusion, Jian Wushuang suddenly heard Elder Yi speak to him, “Jian Wushuang, transform into an Ancient God now.”

“Yes, elder.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

There was a burst of Bloodline Power inside Jian Wushuang unleashed with his will, and his body began to bulge.

In just a moment, he had become a Gold-armored Ancient God about 15 meters tall, and surely, the skin on his chest was dark gold.

“It’s indeed… dark gold!”

Elder Yi stared at Jian Wushuang for a good while.?“His bloodline is so pure with an overpowering oppressing force. Even I shiver under it.

“He does have an Imperial Bloodline!?

“Though only being a small part, those with Imperial Bloodline are nobler than us.

“So many years have passed and finally, we have another man with an Imperial Bloodline in our clan.”

“Haha…”

Elder Yi laughed loudly with joy and excitement.

Jian Wushuang and Elder Ying were puzzled at the sudden laughter.

Elder Ying was not among those seniors of the clan, thus, she did not know some secrets about the clan, such as the Imperial Bloodline.

“A noble with Imperial Bloodline has appeared again, why are you old guys still staying inside?” Elder Yi suddenly turned back and shouted at the palace.

His voice echoed throughout the whole place, however, only a few people in the palace could hear it.

Those people were the ones who had lived for a really long time in the clan.

“Imperial Bloodline? The direct descendant of His Majesty has finally appeared?”

As another loud voice echoed from the underground, the ground where Jian Wushuang stood on started shaking wildly.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang was startled and looked around.

Seeing the sudden change, the clansmen inside the palace were also amazed.

Right then, the ground was cracked open from its center, and from inside stretched out a huge palm. Then, a giant figure climbed out, who tore the ground apart like tearing a coffin that buried him.

It was a Gold-armored Ancient God dozens of meters tall gleaming with golden light.

The god stood towering like a giant mountain, stunning the onlookers just based on visual impact.

“How tall and strong it is.”?Jian Wushuang was amazed.

“It is a human being!”

The giant figure stretched himself after turning up, making a thundering sound. The next moment, the figure began shrinking and finally turned into a middle-aged man about two meters tall, who rushed towards the black pavilion, approaching Jian Wushuang.
