Chapter 3992: Eternal Island

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Divine Beginning Realm, a special Temporal was hidden in the Third Heaven.

This special Temporal was an endless sea, and in the center of the sea was a huge island.

This island had many immortal lakes, spiritual trees, various immortal birds, and flying beasts. There were also many exquisite manors on the island. The manors were dazzling with flowers and were as beautiful as a fairyland on Earth.

The island was called the Eternal Island.

“From today on, our family will live on the Eternal Island.” Jian Wushuang stood in the center of the manors, with his wife and his parents and relatives beside him.

!!

“It’s so beautiful here.” A delicate-looking red-clothed girl looked around the manors and exclaimed.

Her name was Zhuo Yiyi, and she was the granddaughter of Jian Wushuang’s elder brother, Zhuo Peng. If Jian Wushuang was called Jian Wushuang, he would have to call her third grandpa. After all, Jian Wushuang was the third brother of the Zhuo family.

“I spent a lot of money to build this island. Of course it’s beautiful.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the girl in red with a hint of love. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He had lived two lives. In his first life, his parents only had one son. Although he had reunited with his wife, he did not have any children.

In his second life, he was the third son of the Zhuo family. His eldest sister, Zhuo Bing, and his second brother, Zhuo Peng, had long been married and had children. After so many years, the children had already multiplied, there were tens of thousands of direct family members in the Zhuo family. However, only a few of the tens of thousands of Zhuo family members were able to come to the Eternal Island. Only the most direct four generations of family members were able to come here.

As for the Eternal Island, it was built by Jian Wushuang on purpose.

The Divine Beginning Realm had been completely settled down and there would be no more crisis in the future. He no longer had any burden on his body. In the following days, he wanted to stay on the Eternal Island with his wife, he wanted to live with his family.

The name of the island was eternal, but it also meant immortal.

He hoped that he could always be by his family’s side.

As for the universe…perhaps he would go to the universe when he was too bored in the Divine Beginning Realm, but it was still too early.

After resolving the crisis, Jian Wushuang naturally wanted to live a peaceful and peaceful life.

“Husband,” Leng Rushuang suddenly said.

“Well, what’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Rushuang.

“Let me tell you something.” Leng Rushuang quietly whispered in Jian Wushuang’s ear, “I have a baby.”

“You have a baby?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled and did not react immediately. “What do you mean?”

“What do you mean you have a baby?” Leng Rushuang rolled her eyes at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang suddenly understood. His eyes instantly widened as he stared at Leng Rushuang.

“Shuang ‘er, are you serious?” Jian Wushuang’s voice trembled.

“Of course I’m serious.” Leng Rushuang laughed.

“Haha, we have it. We have it.” Jian Wushuang laughed. His smile was a little silly. He did not look like an absolute beginning master, the strongest expert in the entire star field. Instead, he looked like a child.

“What’s wrong? Shuang ‘er, what are you laughing at?” Jian Nantian and the others walked over.

“Father, mother, I, I’m going to be a father.” Jian Wushuang was so excited that he did not know what to say.

“What?” The surrounding people were stunned at first, but then they were pleasantly surprised.

“I’m going to be a grandfather?” Jian Nantian’s eyes were also wide open.

“Nantian, we’re going to have a grandson?” Ji Wumeng was also a little confused.

Then, the entire Eternal Island was in an unprecedented joyous mood.

Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye.

In the manor on the Eternal Island.

“Father, you don’t know. My brother’s talent in sword principle is really incredible. He is definitely the most talented in sword principle I have ever seen. I think you can consider taking him as your disciple. It would be a pity if such a sword principle genius were to be taken away by others.” A handsome young man in a silver robe stood in the open space of the manor, they were talking leisurely.

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang were casually sitting opposite each other at the stone table in front of the silver-robed young man. Jian Wushuang was leisurely drinking a pot of wine, as if he had not heard what the silver-robed young man said.

As for Leng Rushuang, she just smiled and said, “Qing ‘er, how long have you been out training? How many geniuses have you seen? How can you ask your father to take you as his disciple? Your father has high expectations.”

The silver-robed young man whom Leng Rushuang called ‘Qing ‘er’ was her and Jian Wushuang’s son, Jian Qing.

Jian Qing grew up on the Eternal Island. Because of his parents, he was born with great talent. In addition, there were countless resources on the island, and he was personally taught by Jian Wushuang, in just over ten years, he had reached the immortal saint level. When Jian Qing was 16 years old, Jian Wushuang allowed him to travel alone in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Although he only traveled alone, Jian Wushuang had left several tricks on Jian Qing. These tricks were only activated when Jian Qing was in a life-or-death crisis. Once they were activated, not to mention the Divine Beginning Realm…even in this star field, no one could kill him, so Jian Wushuang was naturally at ease.

Jian Qing had traveled in the Divine Beginning Realm for four years, and now he had returned here. As soon as he returned, he told Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang about his good friend’s heaven-defying talent in sword principle.

However, Jian Wushuang did not take it to heart.

What a joke. Jian Qing had only been out for four years, and he was only at the immortal saint level. How many geniuses could he meet?

Even if his good friend’s talent in sword principle was extremely high, it was only for ordinary experts. Perhaps an ordinary Principles Master or even a Ruler would be attracted to such a genius.

However, with Jian Wushuang’s strength, it was very difficult for him to find a genius in the Divine Beginning Realm who could satisfy him and make him want to take him as a disciple.

Jian Qing curled his lips at Leng Rushuang’s words and did not say anything. He had stayed in the Eternal Island for so long. Although he still did not know his father’s true strength and identity, he knew one thing very well, his father was very, very powerful.

He was a Principles Master who was considered a top expert in the Divine Beginning Realm. He had to kneel in front of his father. Even a Ruler had to be respectful in front of his father.

“Qing ‘er, how long do you plan to stay here?” Jian Wushuang finally took a look at Jian Qing.

“I just came back to visit you, father and mother. You’re leaving soon,” Jian Qing said.

“When are you going to come back?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“In a few months, when my sister is born, I’ll come back,” Jian Qing said.

Jian Wushuang could not help glancing at Leng Rushuang’s belly, which was slightly bulging, which made Jian Wushuang smile in his heart.

Yes, he and Leng Rushuang’s second child had been pregnant for three months, and Jian Wushuang had long known that the second child was a daughter.
