Chapter 2563: Nine Days

“Indeed! He’s indeed an Earth Ultimate God!”

The thieves around were gasping in shock from feeling Jian Wushuang’s overpowering divine breath.

The divine power level determined the divine breath, and Jian Wushuang’s divine power was comparable to an Earth Ultimate God; hence his divine breath was naturally at that level.

However, under the black stone’s camouflage, his divine power breath was only at Peak Ultimate God.

“T-this...” The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor also stood there completely stunned.

He could not imagine that Jian Wushuang had already risen to that level in less than three years.

Around only two years ago, he could still completely crush Jian Wushuang and make him powerless to retaliate.

Were it not for Jian Wushuang’s incredible physical defensive capabilities, he could have died in the previous battle with the Governor.

“Mr. Governor, no one else will disturb us again. Let’s continue.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he sent his Blood Mountain Sword forward.

The Governor was startled as he thought that Jian Wushuang’s sword strike would be incredibly terrifying. However, that strike was not powerful at all and he could withstand it pretty easily.

Jian Wushuang and the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor began fighting again. During the process, the Governor noticed that Jian Wushuang had been holding back his abilities.

His divine breath was not completely projected and consistently stayed at the level of a Peak Ultimate God. He was purely battling him using sword techniques. In some situations, Jian Wushuang was even being suppressed by him because of the Sword World and seemed rather embarrassing.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor finally understood the reason from seeing that and it did not need a wise man to finally realize it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is he using me to train his sword principle?”

“He’s precisely feeling my Sword World!”

“This guy...”

The Governor’s face turned purple out of anger.

Anyone who was being used as a testing dummy to increase his abilities would not be happy about it.

However, he dared not slow down one second as he was worried that it would offend Jian Wushuang and caused him to start killing—not just killing him, but also destroying the entire Infernal Heart Prefecture.

He did not doubt that Jian Wushuang could annihilate the entire prefecture.

Due to that, all the Governor could do was to continue playing along with Jian Wushuang by suppressing him with the Sword World’s stunning effects and help him to achieve a breakthrough in his sword principle.

He could not begin to think about how foolish he felt for doing that.

In the blink of an eye, the pair had been fighting under everyone’s watch for a full hour.

“Let’s stop.” Jian Wushuang finally spoke and retreated backward.

“Finally done?” As the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor felt relieved, Jian Wushuang unexpectedly glared at him.

“I can see that you don’t have much divine power left in you. I’ll give you some time to rejuvenate. Let’s do it again as soon as you’re ready.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“What?” The Governor’s face turned paper pale.

The Green Flame Prefecture Governor, Mysterious Shade Prefecture Governor, and surrounding thieves gulped.

Jian Wushuang had already treated the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor as his training mate.

The Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture dared not speak up despite feeling angry.

He had no choice but to try his best to recover his divine powers under Jian Wushuang’s coercion. After a long while, most of his divine powers were finally restored.

“Mr. Governor, shall we continue?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Governor was unable to oppose Jian Wushuang and could only unleash his Sword World once again to stun and suppress him before fighting Jian Wushuang with his full might.

Jian Wushuang did not once display his true ability and only kept his divine aura at the regular Peak Ultimate God level—using only his sword techniques when crossing hands and trading blows with the Governor.

Time flowed by while such battles repeatedly occurred.

Jian Wushuang and the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor fought repeatedly every day as time passed.

Nine days had passed in the blink of an eye.

In those nine days, everyone lost count of how many times Jian Wushuang had fought the Governor. One thing was clear—the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor had to recover his divine powers dozens of times.

After nine days, the Governor felt incredibly tired and embarrassed while Jian Wushuang was still feeling ready to fight.

The Governor even felt like not obliging him a few times. However, he forced himself to swallow the embarrassment as soon as he recalled Jian Wushuang’s battle strength.

Finally, on the tenth day...

“We can stop now,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor immediately stopped.

“In the past 9 days, I’ve learned and felt enough through your Sword World. Although I still haven’t found the most crucial factor to develop my Sword World, it’s still incredibly useful to me. It’s not very meaningful for us to continue at this point.”

Jian Wushuang knew that he had reached a real bottleneck.

He was only one step away from developing his Sword World as he had taken a big leap forward after those nine days. The remaining step could not be achieved just by feeling the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s Sword World.

He could only find alternative ways.

“Mr. Governor, thanks for your help in the past few days. In exchange, I can spare the lives of Infernal Heart Prefecture and the other fourteen prefectures in the Dark Thunder Territory. However, all fifteen prefectures need to provide me with five hundred thousand Primordial Stones as the price to pay for saving the lives of numerous thieves from all fifteen prefectures.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Five hundred thousand?” The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor shuddered.

The governors of Green Flame and Mysterious Shade prefectures were also shocked.

The numerous thieves in the Infernal Heart Prefecture began to look worried.

500,000 was an extremely huge number.

The Fifteen Prefectures were indeed deeply rooted in the Dark Thunder Territory and possessed substantial wealth.

However, the wealth they possessed was a far cry from the Northern Darkstar Continent’s clans.

The three prefectures Jian Wushuang annihilated—Demonic Moon, Heaven Poison, and Underworld—only possessed a total of 90,000 Primordial Stones. Although they had numerous other resources, Jian Yi had said that he only wanted Primordial Stones and nothing else!

Therefore, it was still an extremely huge sum for each of them even if the Fifteen Prefectures equally split up the task.

“I’ll be staying in the Dark Thunder Territory for a while, but too long. I shall return to the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s headquarters before leaving and hope that all the Primordial Stones will be ready by then. By the way, it needs to be purely Primordial Stones so don’t you dare fill in the numbers with other stuff. I’ll use your lives to fill up those gaps if the numbers don’t add up.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and left when he finished.
