Chapter 5500 ¬†Wu Zuo's Embarrassment

That's right!

With that said, Jian Wushuang was no slouch either!

Dao Lord had reached the sixth-level proficiency.

By the time he reached the status of Emperor, it was possible he could break Emperor Jueyun's record.

86 levels!

Back then, saying Emperor Jueyun rivaled the Universe Master was modest.

"The three of us, shall we give it a try?"

Inspired by the idea, all three were eager to test their strength.

There were still two days left until the agreed-upon time with Wu Zuo.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, "I still need some time; there are some things I need to handle!"

"Then the two of us will go explore first!"

"Okay!" Jian Wushuang stood up and saw the two off.

When Wu Zuo's treasure arrived, after devouring that 20 percent of the Universe Origin Source, enhancing his strength further, he would go to Beiwang Tower.

As for heading north!

Now that Gong Miaoyi had damn well betrayed them, he wasn't in a hurry anymore.

When the time came, he would go alone to the mines and find Nie Yuan. After all, imitating that special Sword Dao Origin Source, Nie Yuan's internal Origin Source of Sword Dao was probably even more powerful than Gong Miaoyi's.

It would help him on a larger scale.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang prepared to leave first and head to Wu Zuo's mansion to wait for him.

This place wasn't suitable for cultivation, and even if he had only two days of leisure, he didn't want to miss them.

Just as he was about to get up and leave, a tier 3 Emperor approached respectfully.

"Senior, you have spent a total of 40 million godstones in this temple..."

Oh no...

Jian Wushuang could only take out the token given to him by Wu Zuo and press it down.

At first, the other party didn't believe it. The token of the Hall Master of the Enforcement Hall, a force that made people tremble even in the Northern Territory!

"Senior, please wait a moment. I need to confirm!"

If the token was genuine, then the money would be waived; if it was fake, Jian Wushuang must leave.

Jian Wushuang returned to the room, cursing Wanyan in his heart.

It seemed that the other party was too happy and forgot. Who would have thought that Jian Wushuang, a powerhouse comparable to a tier 6 Emperor, couldn't even produce tens of millions of godstones?

It's truly embarrassing!

In the Heavenly Realm, especially within the Elder Palace, the value of a tier 5 Emperor was not low. Tens of millions of godstones could be easily produced.

Even if there were not so many godstones, there were some treasures that could be pawned.

Unlike Jian Wushuang, who directly produced the token of the Hall Master of the Enforcement Hall.

Seeing the token was like seeing the true form of Wu Zuo.

If the token was genuine, it would be like killing an ant, forcing an Emperor to take action.

A pointless endeavor!

But other than this token, Jian Wushuang only had the Jueyun Sword left.

He couldn't possibly mortgage the Jueyun Sword!

It was the sword of Emperor Jueyun, a sword so revered that using it as collateral for the drinks they consumed would be an outright insult to the way of the sword.

A colossal insult.

Jian Wushuang's respect for the Dao of the Sword had never wavered, and such an act was simply unthinkable for him.

However, upon further consideration, he deemed it even more disgraceful to mortgage his own power of All Things.

No different from what Gong Miaoyi would do.

The Dao should not be taken lightly, especially in the Elder Palace.

Jian Wushuang would never casually jest with his Origin Source.

In no time at all, a tier 3 Emperor walked in, visibly anxious, and carefully handed the token to Jian Wushuang.

Shortly after, a tier 5 Emperor arrived, personally apologizing to Jian Wushuang.

Despite the apologies, Jian Wushuang felt awkward and chose to leave hastily, saying little.

He could imagine the thoughts racing through the mind of that tier 5 Emperor!

Was it necessary to use Wu Zuo's token for a mere tab?

Jian Wushuang did not linger and headed straight to Wu Zuo's mansion!

The Emperor guarding the place recognized Jian Wushuang at a glance and respectfully ushered him into the mansion.

Upon entering the gate, Jian Wushuang noticed that the massive stone stele standing in the courtyard was gone.

Even the incense burner and some decorations had been removed.

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, "It shouldn't be this bad!"

Did Wu Zuo really empty his coffers of 200,000 cubic universe crystals?

Even the tombstones he had erected for his fellow disciples were dismantled to gather treasures for him.

If that were true, it would be too tragic.

Little did he know that the stele had been erected the day before by him.

That was precisely the effect Wu Zuo desired.

Feelings and emotions were not that profound.

Among the disciples of Qishen, there were numerous Universe Masters, and Wu Zuo, a supreme-peak, was inconspicuous among them. If it weren't for him being the last surviving disciple remaining, the formidable figures in the Qishen Temple wouldn't have paid him any attention.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat puzzled. In the beginning, all 18 Divine Generals could be resurrected, so why not revive some of Qishen's disciples? Wouldn't those individuals be more qualified to inherit Qishen's legacy?

It seemed that this had something to do with the aftermath of resurrection.

Jian Wushuang had guessed it right; the resurrected powerhouses would face a hundred times more difficulty in advancing their cultivation realms in the future compared to those on the normal timeline.

It could be said that their potential had diminished, making it impossible to surpass them.

"Jian Wushuang!"

The true form of Wu Zuo approached, and he exclaimed, "What a coincidence! I just returned from the Earth Realm, and here you are!"

"I've been bored these days, planning to visit Lord Wu Zuo's place for a stroll. I didn't expect your speed to be so fast, Lord Wu Zuo; you're already back!" Jian Wushuang laughed.

He felt a bit awkward. To gather enough universe crystals for him, he even dismantled tombstones. Now, he felt somewhat embarrassed, as if he couldn't wait for the appointed time.

"Come, let's talk inside. I've acquired some excellent spiritual herbs from the Forest of Eternal Secrets, perfect for brewing a pot of good tea!"

Wu Zuo didn't show any signs of embarrassment.

It was as if the tombstone had never been erected. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Seeing that Wu Zuo wasn't bothered, Jian Wushuang felt even less concerned. With good tea on offer, it was only right to savor it.

Following Wu Zuo into the main hall, the two sat facing each other at a table.

On the top, several humanoid green fruits were placed.

"The Fruits of All Things?" Jian Wushuang exclaimed. These were priceless items. Since the Forest of Eternal Secrets had been declared off-limits, these fruits hadn't appeared again.

Back when the forest was open to the public, the value of the Fruits of All Things exceeded 10 billion cubic units of godstones, which equated to a trillion stones.

Now, they were priceless.

He didn't expect Wu Zuo to be so generous, directly using these to entertain him.

At the same time, he worried if the treasures weren't complete, and this was just a way to dismiss him prematurely.

"This is your mustard seed, and the Beast God Weapons is among them. However, some other treasures have been damaged, leaving only the accessories of the Beast God Weapon, and its Origin Source has also been damaged!"

Wu Zuo waved his hand, and the Eye of the Candle Dragon, the Armor of the Candle Dragon, the Arm of the Candle Dragon, and the Wings of the Candle Dragon floated towards Jian Wushuang.

Seeing these items, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of joy. As long as the Beast God Weapons were fine, everything else was secondary.

"Let's have tea first!" Wu Zuo personally poured tea for Jian Wushuang, making him feel pleasantly surprised.

After this series of gestures, if the other party hadn't collected all the treasures, he really wouldn't have the heart to demand them.

Jian Wushuang took the cup and expressed his gratitude.

Then, a hint of perplexity appeared on Wu Zuo's face, and he said, "Ah, it's been a long time since I've leisurely enjoyed tea like this. The Earth Realm is really chaotic this time."
