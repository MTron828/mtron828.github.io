4129 Surprise

A terrifying aura swept out and directly swept up a void storm. Countless gusts of wind whistled and exploded.

At the center of the storm, Ninth Kalpa King’s skin turned pitch-black, and crisscrossed divine patterns appeared on his body. They were extremely strange, like divine demons from the underworld.

“Jian Wushuang, as a third-level Ruler who has cultivated for less than 300,000 years, you should be proud of yourself for forcing me to use my innate divine power.” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang with his hands behind his back, he looked indifferent.

A circular storm formed automatically within a radius of 300 feet around him. Violent void storms swept in all directions and swept across the area. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At the same time, waves of profound and profound nomological aura emanated from the mysterious divine patterns on his body. At this moment, his aura had reached its peak.

“Ninth Kalpa King has used his innate divine ability.”

“Ninth Kalpa King’s innate divine ability, demon god evolution, is able to increase his strength by several times or even nearly ten times. It’s definitely a divine ability that can greatly increase his battle strength. Jian Wushuang has also awakened his innate divine ability before. I don’t know if he can still resist Ninth Kalpa King.”

“I don’t think so. However, it’s still impressive that he can force Ninth Kalpa King to use his innate divine ability. Even if Jian Wushuang loses, it’s still impressive.”

The experts watching the battle outside the arena were discussing.

In the space of the arena, Jian Wushuang could not help raising his eyebrows when he saw the huge change in Ninth Kalpa King’s Divine Body and the sudden surge in his aura. “Is this the innate divine ability that Ninth Kalpa King has awakened? It looks pretty good.”

“Jian Wushuang, that’s it.”

Whoosh!

As soon as he finished speaking, a cold light suddenly flashed in Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes. His body turned into a black stream, leaving a series of afterimages in the starry sky as he rushed toward Jian Wushuang!

“This speed...is at least several times faster!” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted when he saw this, and a trace of surprise could not help appearing on his face.

With a long laugh, Ninth Kalpa King quickly formed a seal in the void.

“Great destruction seal!”

In an instant, a terrifying power spread out from Ninth Kalpa King’s body!

Countless storm auras were drawn out from the void, then shot out from all directions. Finally, they gathered together and kept twisting, forming a towering giant hand.

The giant hand was thousands of feet wide and incomparably majestic. A wave of destructive aura spread out, which was extremely terrifying!

The great destruction seal was the Ninth Kalpa King’s famous absolute art, the first of the nine palm techniques. Previously, when the Ninth Kalpa King had used this palm, it had been easily defeated by Jian Wushuang.

But now, the power of the same palm had increased by nearly ten times.

This palm strike gave Jian Wushuang the feeling that it was almost close to the ninth palm print.

“It seems that I have to be a little more serious.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, then suddenly raised his head and looked at the huge palm print, which was so strong that it was about to change, it pressed down inch by Inch and was invincible. It was getting closer and closer to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s black hair and black robe were fluttering in the wild wind.

Outside the arena, many people were looking at Jian Wushuang through the mystic light mirror.

Everyone was watching how Jian Wushuang was going to deal with the Ninth Kalpa King.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang drew his sword.

It was a casual sword move.

It was like a beginner practicing a simple sword move.

Almost everyone outside the arena could see that Jian Wushuang’s sword move was very ordinary, at least in terms of moves. At most, it contained the universe origin of sword principle and the universe principle.

Such a sword might have been able to withstand the Ninth Kalpa King, who had not used his innate divine power. But now, the Ninth Kalpa King, who had used his innate divine power, had his battle strength increased by nearly ten times, the power of the great destruction seal was also nearly ten times more terrifying.

How could Jian Wushuang block such a simple and casual attack?

“What’s going on with Jian Wushuang?”

“Is he giving up because he knows he can’t defeat him?”

“It shouldn’t be. At least he should use his innate divine power to try and resist it.”

The experts watching the battle outside the trial field were puzzled.

However, the next moment, when Jian Wushuang’s casual attack collided with the huge palm print of the Ninth Kalpa King, everyone’s faces froze.

The huge palm, which was thousands of feet wide, was mercilessly slashed by the sword light. The entire palm collapsed instantly and endless divine power scattered in all directions. Even the power of Jian Wushuang’s sword light was not completely exhausted, it continued to slash at Ninth Kalpa King.

Ninth Kalpa King was shocked. He quickly attacked again to block the residual power of the sword light, but he was forced back several steps.

After regaining his balance, Ninth Kalpa King was stunned.

He was not the only one. The experts watching the battle outside the arena were also shocked.

“How could this be?”

“Ninth Kalpa King has already used his innate divine power, and his strength has increased tenfold. How could Jian Wushuang defeat his absolute art so easily? What’s going on?”

“I don’t understand either. I thought Jian Wushuang had given up.”

Most of the spectators outside the trial arena were baffled. They did not know what had just happened. How could Jian Wushuang defeat Ninth Kalpa King’s Ultimate skill so easily with his casual swordsmanship.

In the isolated void, Supreme Gai Fu, Ruler Blood Wave, and Supreme Giant Axe all looked solemn.

Others might not be able to tell what had just happened, but they were all Supreme-beings, so they could tell at a glance.

“Will power,” Supreme Giant Axe said, “Jian Wushuang has such a powerful will power!”

“Ninth Kalpa King used his innate divine power and his strength increased tenfold, but his absolute art was still easily defeated by his sword. The will power he has mastered is very terrifying. If I’m not mistaken, the will power has definitely increased the power of his swordsmanship by more than tenfold!” Ruler Blood Wave exclaimed.

“The power of his will...” Ruler Gai Fu’s eyes narrowed slightly. “If my guess is correct, this power of his will should have been bestowed upon him by the principles of the universe. In other words, this little fellow once had a unique opportunity to gain the approval of the principles of the universe. He was even personally bestowed with a portion of the power of his will by the principles of the universe.”

“He was personally bestowed by the principles of the universe?” Ruler Blood Wave’s eyes lit up, and a smile appeared on his face. “This kid really gave us a big surprise.”

“...”
