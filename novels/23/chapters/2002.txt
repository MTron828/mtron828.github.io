Chapter 2003: Supreme Meeting

Mixed Element Spirit wasn’t a sword principle that focused on its form.

It focused on the mood, or in other words, sword intention.

The sword intention could be combined with the doctrine that a person comprehended perfectly.

Jian Wushuang comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine and his sword intention could become a reincarnation cycle. For instance, Jian Wushuang turned into a space blackhole that revolved like reincarnation and swallowed everything.

Although he continuously performed over a dozen strokes and they looked like they were different, in actual fact, he was performing the same sword principle, Mixed Element Spirit. It was merely because there were many patterns and forms.

“Among the four moves in Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Mixed Element Spirit was the most exquisite one. Because of Mixed Element Spirit, people found the sword principle perfect and almost flawless,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In ancient times, Sword Geek Jiu Jue hadn’t found any flaw in the sword expert who created Sword Principle Xuan Luo. No matter how intense his attacks were, the sword expert managed to defend. If it wasn’t because there was a difference in their divine power, it would be impossible for Jiu Jue to defeat the sword expert.

Hence, Mixed Element Spirit could be said to be the true essence of Sword Principle Xuan Luo.

As for the other three moves of the sword principle, they were all exquisite and powerful too. However, in Jian Wushuang’s view, they weren’t as well-crafted as Mixed Element Spirits.

“I completely mastered the four moves in Sword Principle Xuan Luo after comprehending for one thousand and eight hundred years. I could also perform them perfectly. However, the power of the four moves in the sword principle would continue to improve as my comprehension heightened. I have to figure out a way to improve my understanding of swordsmanship,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Just then… There was a sudden vibration from a token in Jian Wushuang’s Qian Kun ring.

“Huh? Emperor Bai sent me a message?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

The vibrating token belonged to Emperor Bai.

Jian Wushuang immediately started reading. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Supreme meeting of Sanctuary Alliance? Held in Thunderbolt Island?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Sanctuary Alliance was the highest alliance formed by human cultivators in order to deal with potential danger in Eternal Chaotic World.

Previously, although Jian Wushuang had a conflict with Sanctuary Alliance because of Green Fire World, he was still a member of Sanctuary Alliance.

Sanctuary Alliance was going to have a supreme meeting and he naturally qualified to participate as he was also one with fighting power of a Great Emperor.

…

In Thunderbolt Island, there was an ancient, tall pavilion towering over the peak of Sanctuary Alliance. It was named Presbytery Pavilion.

Presbytery Pavilion represents the highest authority of Sanctuary Alliance. Over the years, the higher-ups and experts from Sanctuary Alliance would gather at Presbytery Pavilion only when there was a major incident in Eternal Chaotic World. Whatever command was given via Presbytery Pavilion would be the highest command from Sanctuary Alliance.

Even the command of the supreme one in Sanctuary Alliance, Emperor Bai, wouldn’t be higher than the command from Presbytery Pavilion.

There was a huge round table in the middle of the void in Presbytery Pavilion. There were lofty thrones surrounding the round table.

Every single throne was huge and there were many people who were seated on the thrones.

For instance, Abysmal Saint Master, Ancestor Tian Chen, Great Emperor Zi Xu, Great Emperor Colored Glaze and many others had arrived.

Vroom!!

On one of the thrones, a figure slowly substantiated. It was Jian Wushuang.

Green Fire World and the surrounding ancient battlefield were extremely important to Sanctuary Alliance. Hence, Sanctuary Alliance had already paid a great price to build a spacetime wormhole outside the ancient battlefield, which was Snow Kingdom. It could connect to the ten cultivation sanctuaries and Thunderbolt Island.

Hence, Jian Wushuang didn’t need to spend much time to rush to Thunderbolt Island from Green Fire World.

The moment Jian Wushuang appeared, there were many Great Emperors who looked over.

“Sword Emperor!”

“Sword Emperor!”

Great Emperors who didn’t have beef with Jian Wushuang, like Great Emperor Purple Moon and Great Emperor East Royal, greeted Jian Wushuang simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang responded with a smile.

“Sword Emperor only came alone? How about your sword servant and Lord Sound Spirit? There was a gentle voice. It was Great Emperor Zi Xu who asked.

Great Emperor Zi Xu flashed a gentle smile and his eyes revealed kindness as well.

Back then, although Great Emperor Zi Xu had once collaborated with Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze to corner him, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Jian Wushuang shared no resentment, nor did they have conflict. Hence, neither party held grudges.

“My sword servant is in Green Fire World. As for Lord Sound Spirit, she isn’t one from Sanctuary Alliance,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“I see,” Great Emperor Zi Xu was surprised but he didn’t ask further.

As for Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze wasn’t happy, but Jian Wushuang didn’t bother with them either.

Besides that, among the Great Emperors there, there was another person who was unhappy with Jian Wushuang.

The person was, of course, Yan Zun.

One thousand eight hundred years ago, Jian Wushuang had challenged him and trampled on him mercilessly before many experts, which he was embarrassed about.

Although he had investigated and found out it was because of Emperor God Han Ye, who had offered a sword stele in exchange for Jian Wushuang to do that, it was a fact that Jian Wushuang had trampled on him.

“Almost all thirteen Great Emperors of Sanctuary Alliance are here,” Jian Wushuang looked around.

Although there weren’t only thirteen Great Emperors on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, the other few didn’t join Sanctuary Alliance. For instance, Master Wu wasn’t in Sanctuary Alliance. Hence, he naturally wouldn’t participate in the meeting.

Then, if Jian Wushuang didn’t include himself, there were ten of them who were already seated around the round table. Among the ten Great Emperors, there were some who came in person and some who attended with incarnation.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

Then, three figures substantiated at the same time. The last three Great Emperors arrived.

The last three Great Emperors were Emperor Bai, Red Dragon King and Ancestor Tian Chen.

In Sanctuary Alliance, the thirteen Great Emperors, including Jian Wushuang, all fourteen Great Emperor experts were there.

The supreme meeting started then.

“Everyone.”

It was a low, deep voice that belonged to Red Dragon King.

Red Dragon King, in the second place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, second to Emperor Bai, he had once received the bloodline of an ancient dragon tribe in an ancient battlefield. Hence, he looked just like an ordinary human. The only obvious difference was the pair of red dragon horns on his forehead.

“Sanctuary Alliance held this supreme meeting for only one matter!”

“Everyone, please watch.”

Red Dragon went straight to the point. He didn’t even bother greeting the Great Emperors and took out a token straightaway.

The token was a mirror token.

There was a huge image that appeared before all the Great Emperors then.

All Great Emperors, including Jian Wushuang, were staring at the image.

It was the black steel ball of the size of a holy kingdom plunging in the boundless void and rolling over everything.
