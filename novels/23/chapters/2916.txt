Chapter 2917: Unkillable!

——

“Junior Sister Qiu!”

The cold-arrogant woman called out. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Behind her, the blue-haired woman who had caused Leng Rushuang to fall into a deep sleep, walked up once more.

“This Divine Master controls an immortal body, and his divine power seems to be extremely vast. It will be tough to kill him with just material attacks. I can only leave him to you,” the cold-arrogant woman said.

“Okay.” The blue-haired woman nodded slightly, and then she floated forward.

In the blink of an eye, the blue-haired woman had landed beside Zi Yi.

“I’ll have to ask you to fight again,” Zi Yi said, “although his combat strength is good, he’s only a Divine Master. However, with your skills, it should be straightforward to kill him.”

“Just watch,” the blue-haired woman said. Then she looked at Jian Wushuang with her cold eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood there with a cold expression.

Although he had been fighting with Zi Yi, he had been paying attention to Leng Rushuang. Then, finally, he saw the blue-haired woman put Leng Rushuang into a deep sleep.

Now, the blue-haired woman appeared in front of him again.

Buzz!

A strange power swept out from the blue-haired woman’s body.

This power did not have any ability, but Jian Wushuang had sensed it the moment it swept out.

“Soul attack?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened, not feeling surprised at all.

He had an immortal body, so it was challenging to kill him with material attacks. The best way to kill an expert with an immortal body was to kill his soul directly.

The blue-haired woman was an Immortal Saint who was good at soul attacks.

“Destroy!”

The blue-haired woman stretched out her hand and let out a low shout.

In an instant, the magnificent soul power surged again and covered Jian Wushuang in all directions.

Soul blast!

Without any hesitation, the soul blast was carried out in a crushing manner!

There was no way to dodge the soul attack, so Jian Wushuang stood there and let the magnificent soul power cover his body.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang felt a rumble in his head.

The blue-haired woman specialized in the soul. When her soul attack was strong, Jian Wushuang estimated that the average Immortal Saints like Long Xingzi and Realm Lord Tian Qu would have a hard time resisting the blue-haired woman’s attack. Their souls would be destroyed in an instant. Even a True Saint like Saint Hong would have a hard time resisting it.

As for Jian wushuang himself, as Zi Yi had said, he was strong in battle, but his real realm was only that of a Divine Master. Moreover, he was only an Advanced Great Divine Master and had not reached the limit of a Great Divine Master yet. Therefore, in terms of soul, he was not very strong, and he was also only at the peak of the Great Divine Master level.

Even if the exquisite pagoda guarded his real soul, the second level could not withstand such a soul attack.

Bang!

The exquisite pagoda directly collapsed. The terrifying soul power attacked Jian Wushuang’s natural soul. In just a moment, Jian Wushuang’s real soul was destroyed.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the Immortal Saints from the Supreme Emotion Valley and many experts from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had been staring at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, they saw Jian Wushuang’s eyes dim and his divine body collapse.

“He’s dead. He’s dead now.” Saint Hong could not help sighing.

“Jian Yi is indeed a genius. Incredibly, he has the battle strength of a True Saint in the Divine Master realm. Even I can’t help admiring him, but unfortunately, he is too arrogant. Or rather, the opponent he provoked is too strong.” Long Xingzi could not help sighing.

“Supreme Emotion Valley, that’s the Supreme Emotion Valley!”

“Since we can’t kill them with material attacks, we can directly use soul attacks to wipe them out. Unfortunately, the people from the Supreme Emotion Valley are really ruthless.”

The experts in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion also sighed.

The experts from the Supreme Emotion Valley all had cold expressions.

“Let’s go.” The cold-arrogant woman waved her hand gently.

Zi Yi and the blue-haired woman nodded slightly and prepared to leave.

But at this moment…

Jian Wushuang, who had fallen to the ground and turned into a corpse, suddenly opened his eyes!

The moment he opened his eyes, a powerful sword essence immediately burst out.

“What?”

The cold-arrogant woman, Zi Yi, all the Immortal Saints of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, Saint Hong, Long Xingzi, Chu Yong, and the other experts and disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were all shocked at this moment.

One by one, they looked at Jian Wushuang with shock and bewilderment.

Especially the blue-haired woman who had killed Jian Wushuang with her soul attack, she was now staring at Jian Wushuang.

Under their gazes, Jian Wushuang had indeed come back to life.

Not only had he come back to life, but his aura was also influential. It was evident that he was not affected at all.

“Where do you want to go?” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed between heaven and earth.

After his voice sounded, the entire heaven and earth became completely silent.

Silence, dead silence!

All the experts present were stunned as if they had seen something incredible.

They had seen something incredible.

“He is dead. He was killed by my soul directly. His soul was destroyed. How could he still be alive?”

“How is this possible?!”

The blue-haired woman shook her head crazily and growled.

“This, this…”

The cold-arrogant woman, Zi Yi, Saint Hong, and the others did not know what to say.

When they saw that Jian Wushuang had mastered the immortal body and knew that material attacks could not kill him, they immediately switched to soul attacks.

However, Jian Wushuang’s soul had been destroyed after the soul attack, but he still survived?

What on earth was going on?

Everyone was stunned.

Only Jian Wushuang knew very well.

The immortal body he controlled was derived from his perfect chaotic life form. It was the perfect immortal body. Not only was this immortal body ineffective in material attacks, but even soul attacks were also ineffective.

He could infinitely replenish his divine body and substantial soul as long as he had sufficient divine power.

So what if his soul was destroyed?

He could completely recover in the blink of an eye!

He was truly undying!

He was invulnerable!

Not to mention a mere Immortal Saint, even a stronger master might not be able to kill him!
