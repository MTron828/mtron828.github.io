Chapter 173: Looking for Help

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and tried to calm down.

“The Palace Master is right. I must save my father, but not in a reckless way.” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s good that you’ve calmed down,” Palace Master White said, nodding. “Your father remains in custody in Nine Ring Mountain where there is a strong Sect, called Nine Emperors Sect.”

“The Nine Emperors Sect?” Jian Wushuang asked and raised his eyebrows.

“Since your father is imprisoned in the Nine Ring Mountain, he must be in the custody of the Nine Emperors Sect.” Palace Master White said solemnly.

“I checked your background and know that you’ve only dealt with Tianyuan Sword Sect, one of the five grand Sects in Tianyan Province. There are indeed several Superiors of the Yin Void Realm in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, but their skills are all at average level. In Tianzong Dynasty, Tianyuan Sword Sect can only be considered a first-rate Sect.”

“Nine Emperors Sect is much more powerful and despotic than Tianyuan Sword Sect, and is considered a top Sect, even for the whole Tianzong Dynasty.”

Jian Wushuang looked grave, thinking that obviously, the strength of the top Sect in Tianzong Dynasty could never be poor.

So it seemed like an insurmountable task to save his father from the clutches of the Nine Emperors Sect, where he was in custody.

“As far as I know, there are a total of eight experts of Yin Void Realm in the Nine Emperors Sect,” Palace Master White continued,

“including three at Initial Yin Void Realm, two at Profound, two at exceptional and one Upper Elder, who has been cultivated in seclusion in the Nine Emperors Sect and has already reached Peak of Yin Void Realm.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned even more.

A good eight experts of Yin Void, all with powerful strength.

At his present strength level, he could pay little attention to the three at Initial Yin Void Realm. He could even defeat or kill those at Profound Yin Void Realm with ease. However, Jian Wushuang did not have the confidence to defeat the expert of Exceptional Yin Void Realm.

As for the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, Jian Wushuang would only stand a chance against him if he used the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.

In Nine Emperors Sect, there were already two Powerhouse at Fulfillment, and on top of that, the Upper Elder who had reached Peak of the Yin Void Realm after his cultivation in seclusion.

With Jian Wushuang’s present strength, it was totally a daydream for him to save his father alone.

“Apart from the eight experts of the Yin Void Realm that we know of, the fact that the Blood Feather Tower imprisons your father under the custody of the Nine Emperors Sect proves that there is a more complicated relationship between them. It’s possible that the Nine Emperors Sect has already yielded to the Blood Feather Tower. So there may be some killers of Blood Feather Tower’s people in the Nine Emperors Sect.” said Palace Master White.

“Yes, it is possible.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew well that Blood Feather Tower regarded his father as a highly valuable prisoner.

In order to arrest his father, the Blood Feather Tower had risked the extermination of one of the greatest clans — Ji Clan. So it was not surprising that the Blood Feather Tower would dispatch reliable experts to guard such an important person.

Jian Wushuang asked, “Are there any experts of Yang Void Realm in the Nine Emperors Sect?”

“Yang Void Realm?” Palace Master White shook her head and said, “There are not many experts at the level of Yang Void Realm in the entire Tianzong Dynasty. Yang Void Realm experts are highly valued by all sects. Although the Blood Feather Tower has staggering strength, they won’t expend a Yang Void Realm Powerhouse just to guard a person, even if the person is extremely important.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That’s good. At least, there is a little hope left for me.” Jian Wushuang nodded to himself.

It would be even more difficult to save his father if he was being guarded by a Yang Void Realm Powerhouse.

Although he knew well that there was a large number of Powerhouses in the Nine Emperors Sect and even in the Blood Feather Tower, there was still some hope of him being able to save his father.

“Jian Wushuang, there is something you must know first.” Palace Master White looked at Jian Wushuang and said seriously, “the Dragon Palace has reached an armistice with the Blood Feather Tower, so it is absolutely unreasonable for us to fight them. If you go to rescue your father, the experts of the Dragon Palace would not be able to offer help.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had not intended to ask the Dragon Palace experts for help.

“Though we can’t help, the Golden-dragon Palace can do that.” Palace Master White said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and asked, “The Golden-dragon Palace?”

“There are many powerhouses in the Golden-dragon Palace. Since the Golden-dragon Guards and Ambassadors are not strictly restrained, their intentions and actions have no bearing on Dragon Palace. So... perhaps I can help you contact some reliable Ambassadors and get their support,” said Palace Master White with a smile.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up immediately.

“Thank you so much, Your Excellency Palace Master.” Jian Wushuang said with appreciation.

“Ha-ha, take it easy. I will personally select the Golden Dragon Ambassadors who won’t let you down. I promise,” said Palace Master White with a smile.

“Thank you so much.” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude again.

...

Jian Wushuang went back to the manor, but this time, he didn’t smile and wore a serious expression.

“Third brother, what happened?”

The three people, including Wang Yuan, who had drunk with Jian Wushuang in the manor noticed the change in his facial expression.

“Big brother, second brother and little sister, I need your help.” Jian Wushuang said without preamble.

“We’re brothers. Just tell us.” Wang Yuan said frankly and readily.

Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang.

They knew Jian Wushuang well and were aware that he who would never ask for help unless it was something important.

“I want to rescue my father,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What?” Wang Yuan and the other two immediately asked, eyes widened.

To rescue his father?

Jian Wushuang gave his brothers and sister a succinct explanation of the situation, telling them about the location where his father was held and the strength of the Nine Emperors Sect. He trusted his brothers and sister absolutely, and did not withhold any information from them.

“The Nine Emperors Sect has so many experts that it is impossible for us to rescue anyone by ourselves.” Yang Zaixuan said in a low voice.

“Of course it won’t be possible with just the four of us. I have requested Palace Master White to help me invite several reliable and strong Golden Dragon Ambassadors to join the rescue mission,” said Jian Wushuang.

“The Golden Dragon Messengers? Not bad.” Yang Zaixuan nodded and said, “I will do you a favor.”

“Third brother,” Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “You almost lost your life to win me the Black Water Lotus. I’ll definitely give you any help you need.”

Smiling at Su Rou, Jian Wushuang then looked at Wang Yuan.

“Hey, don’t look at me.” Wang Yuan waved his hands.

“You three rank within the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List and are strong enough to kill any normal experts of the Yin Void Realm, so you’re skilled enough for the rescue. As for me, I just reached the Initial Gold Core Realm. My strength is ordinary and any powerhouse from the Nine Emperors Sect could kill me easily. It seems that I’d be courting death if I go.”

Jian Wushuang gave Wang Yuan a look but held his tongue.

Not long after inviting Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou for the rescue mission, they heard from Palace Master White.
