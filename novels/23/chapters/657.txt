Chapter 658: Sword Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After stepping inside Sword Palace, Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at a huge Martial Arts Practice Field where there were lots of people seated with their legs crossed. At first glance, there seemed to be hundreds of people. All of them were sitting with their legs crossed, listening silently to the lecture delivered by the young man at the top of the platform.

The young man looked rather pale and his voice sounded somewhat weak as if he got ill very often.

However, such a sickly man himself exuded a sort of frightful Sword Essence which could easily destroy Jian Wushuang.

It suddenly struck Jian Wushuang that this sickly young man was actually one of the two Vice Palace Masters in Sword Palace, and he was currently giving a lecture.

Jian Wushuang immediately found a place to sit down. He dared not make a sound and listened carefully.

The Vice Palace Master was telling them some of his experiences related to Sword Principle, as well as dilemmas people might run across and their solutions.

Jian Wushuang grew increasingly fascinated.

As time went by, half a day passed in the twinkling of an eye. As his lecture was coming to an end, the Vice Palace Master suddenly stood up and executed a simple move on the platform.

The sword swing did not any ups or downs, it was a plain move that left the space it passed through similarly undisturbed.

On the surface, the movement of his sword looked like it completely lacked strength. However, as soon as the Vice Palace Master finished, an ear-piercing noise burst from where the longsword chopped and an unprecedented Sword Essence surged out from that empty area.

Since almost all the people who attended lectures at Martial Arts Practice Field were good at exploring Sword Principle and had high attainment in it, they were all amazed at what they saw and a few of them were even somewhat inspired.

Like Jian Wushuang, he had a remarkable aptitude for Sword Principle and was currently in theHeaven-treading Realm. This movement evoked a strong feeling inside of him.

Immediately closing his eyes without leaving the Martial Arts Practice Field, he began meditating, remaining there for a whole hour before he opened his eyes.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang relaxed as a smile grew on his face.

“Speaking of excellent moves, the movement of the Vice Palace Master was no match for the move that Xuan Yi used to split Shi Qianhan in two, but the move Xuan Yi used was too quick to catch up with while the movement of this Vice Palace Master...” Jian Wushuang recalled the movement just now.

Apparently, this Vice Palace Master had controlled the speed so that everyone could see it clearly and be truly inspired.

People like Jian Wushuang benefited a lot.

Most of the people at Martial Arts Practice Field had also benefitted a lot.

Right then...

“Haha, I figured it out!” A voice full of surprise sounded throughout the Martial Arts Practice Field.

All of the people at Martial Arts Practice Field immediately looked at the direction of the sound and they found a slightly fat bald teenager who looked simple and honest laughing out loud.

“Figured it out?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “What did you figure out?”

The bald teenager went straight before the Vice Palace Master while ignoring the stares of everyone around him.

“Vice Palace Master Nie, I’ve fully comprehended the first sword scar,” the bald teenager said respectfully.

“Eh?” Vice Palace Master Nie raised his eyebrows.

However, his appearance seemed to cause a stir at Martial Arts Practice Field. Everyone looked slightly surprised.

“The first sword scar?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Show us your talent,” Vice Palace Master Nie said.

“Ok.” The bald teenager nodded and immediately began to practice his sword at Martial Arts Practice Field.

“Look! It’s the first move!”

The bald teenager quickly displayed his move. The first attack dashed forward, accompanied by a lighting-speed sword-light that easily penetrated the space in front of him.

“This is the second sword!”

The second sword attack was released, leaving behind the impression of a vast and endless Void.

“This is the third sword!”

When the third sword attack was released, it demonstrated great vigor and even violence.

“Look! It’s the fourth move!”

“The fifth move!”

The sword attacks continued on, with each move giving off a completely different prospect.

“The ninth move!”

The bald teenager spoke again as the ninth move was released, causing the whole area to tremble.

After all nine moves were finished, the bald teenager stopped.

Up on the high platform, Vice Palace Master Nie witnessed the swordsmanship of the bald teenager. As soon as the nine moves were finished, he nodded, smiled, and said, “Not bad. Since you’ve finished the nine moves, that means you’ve comprehended the first sword scar. From now on, you’re qualified to attend the Palace Masters’ lectures at Sword Tower.”

“Thank you, Vice Palace Master Nie!” The bald teenager looked surprised.

The other Sword Principle on the Drill Ground looked at the bald teenager enviously.

However, Jian Wushuang grew even more baffled.

“Since the man just displayed the nine moves, demonstrating that he’s comprehended the first sword scar, he was now eligible to attend lectures delivered by Palace Masters? Isn’t anyone else qualified to go to the Sword Tower?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Before long, the Sword Principle Warriors on the Martial Arts Practice Field left along with Vice Palace Master Nie.

The bald teenager who just performed the sword move also got up and was about to leave.

“Hey! Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang walked towards the bald teenager.

“Eh?” The bald teenager frowned when he saw Jian Wushuang. “Skyscraping Realm? And I haven’t seen you before?”

In the Ancient Sect, the ordinary disciples were mostly at the level of a Divine Realm expert, but a few of them were only in the Skyscraping Realm.

“Who are you?” The bald teenager asked.

“I’m Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang introduced himself. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Jian Wushuang? I haven’t heard of you. You must have just joined the Ancient Sect, right?” The bald teenager asked.

“You’re right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“No wonder,” The bald teenager shrugged. “I’m Zhu Lie, an outer disciple. What about you? Are you an outer disciple or?”

“I was lucky enough to gain a place as an inner disciple at Firmament Territory Feast,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled.

“Inner disciple?” Zhu Lie paused for a while and soon a smile grew full of his face. “That means you’re Senior Brother Jian Wushuang! I pay my respects.”

“Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang also paused for a moment as he had just called Zhu Lie Senior Brother, but now Zhu Lie was calling him Senior Brother instead.

“You don’t know about this, Senior Brother. No matter how long you stay at the Ancient Sect, only your strength and status matter. Generally, the outer disciple will call the inner disciples Senior Brother,” said Zhu Lie.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang didn’t know how to react.
