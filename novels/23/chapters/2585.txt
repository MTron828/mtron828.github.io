Chapter 2586: The Top High-level Ultimate God

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Put those cultivation resources aside for the time being. We now have six million eight hundred thousand of Primordial Stones alone plus the three hundred thousand left behind by San Shouwang and the two hundred thousand each from the Shi Clan and the Wu Clan. Altogether, there are a whopping seven million and five hundred thousand Primordial Stones!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining bright.

There were so many Primordial Stones! If he could absorb and refine all of them, then his strength would skyrocket!

“Breakthrough to High-level Ultimate God Realm is not a problem at all but I’m not sure if I could break through to Peak Ultimate God Realm?”

Jian Wushuang held his hands, his heart fluttered with high anticipation.

“Xin’er and Commander Cang Heng, I need to go into seclusion for some time. Both of you will handle the matters on the Territorial Lord Mansion and Official Army. Don’t come to me if there’s nothing important,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Both Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng nodded their heads.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived alone at the underground palace.

The underground palace was huge and extremely well-hidden with its surrounding area also heavily guarded. It was an excellent place for cultivating in seclusion.

Jian Wushuang sat down cross-legged and waved his hand as countless Primordial Stones appeared in front of him.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling in excitement upon looking at those Primordial Stones.

“Let’s start!”

A gush of terrifying power erupted from Jian Wushuang and engulfed the Primordial Stone as though devouring them.

Jian Wushuang began to absorb and refine these Primordial Stones.

Time was slowly slipping away.

His speed in refining the Primordial Stones too had increased tremendously upon Jian Wushuang’s breakthrough to Primary-level Ultimate God. It used to take him three months to refine those 500,000 Primordial Stones he obtained from the Dark Thunder Territory.

At that instance, there were a total of seven million five hundred thousand Primordial Stones placed in front of him which was fifteen times more than the previous 500,000!

It was only natural for him to take a much longer time.

It took him three years. A total of three full years before he had finally completely refined the seven million five hundred thousand Primordial Stones.

His cultivation realm had also progressed from Primary-level Ultimate God to High-level Ultimate God by then. He had reached the very limits of High-level Ultimate God.

He was only a small step away from reaching Peak Ultimate God.

“It’s a pity there were too many Primordial Stones to refine and the effect from the refinery reduced toward the end. I thought that these seven million five hundred thousand Primordial Stones could allow me to hit the Peak Ultimate God realm but now it seems a bit too whimsical,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Although Primordial Stones contained extremely pure divine powers, Jian Wushuang’s ability to refine and absorb the divine powers within those stones had reduced as his realm progressed. Its absorption effect got worse the higher his realm became.

Unfortunately, that was the case when he had reached a High-level Ultimate God. Likewise, Primordial Stones would be less and less useful to him in the future once he crossed into the Earth Ultimate God realm such that its effect would be negligible.

Refining Primordial Stones alone could no longer meet his needs. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He would have to find something with purer and more powerful divine powers than the Primordial Stones if he chose to continue refining divine powers to improve his realm in the future.

“Although I could not directly breakthrough and reach the Peak Ultimate God realm, it’s still good to reach the very limits of High-level Ultimate God. At least it saved me a lot of cultivation time and divine powers accumulation. I’ve spent a lot of effort in killing San Shouwang and it’s finally worth it since I’ve become the new Territorial Lord.”

“My only regret is that I didn’t get The Stately Painting from San Shouwang.” Jian Wushuang squinted slightly.

The Stately Painting was his prized possession and also the real reason for him to target San Shouwang.

It was a pity The Stately Painting fell into the Star Picking Pavilion’s hands.

“Three years have passed and there are only eight years more years before the eleven years timeframe. In these eight years, I have to get ready besides improving my strength as much as possible,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He had made another cultivation realm breakthrough from a Primary-level Ultimate God and made it into the peak of the High-level Ultimate God Realm. His overall strength had improved a lot and he was no longer worried even if he faced a Peak Earth Ultimate God.

The auction event eight years later at Star Picking Pavilion was extremely large with countless experts participating in the auction that even Heaven Ultimate Gods might be attending the event. If Jian Wushuang wanted to recover The Stately Painting which used to be his from the auction, he must be capable in terms of both wealth and strength.

His strength at that time was still somewhat insufficient!

“I should meditate slowly.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes again.

Time flew past.

In Jian Wushuang’s previous life at Eternal Chaotic World, there was no restriction from the Heavenly Way and almost no concept of time there.

Take anyone from the Chaotic Realm as an example, they had probably lived from millions of years to more than ten million years which made all of them extremely old.

Like those ancient experts who were in hibernation, they had lived from ancient times to the Second Era with their life span beyond anyone’s imagination.

His current life in the Ancient God Domain was completely under the will of Heavenly Way’s control with a completely different time concept.

The lifespan of a cultivator was limited as lifespans of a powerful Ultimate God was far less than a Chaotic Realm in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Jian Wushuang even wondered if the passing time in the Ancient God Domain was similar to the Eternal Chaotic World.

Could it be that a year in the Ancient God Domain equated to 10 or even 100 years in the Eternal Chaotic World?

Of course, he only suspected the possibility but was unsure of it.

Jian Wushuang had officially become the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord for ten years.

In the past ten years, apart from Jian Wushuang staying in the underground palace for the first three years to absorb and refine Primordial Stones, he spent the other seven years very casually. He spent some time cultivating while other times eating and drinking with ordinary people. He even spent some time sleeping and wandering around the Northern Darkstar Territory...

For him, those activities were part of his cultivation.

Staying in seclusion to achieve enlightenment was not necessarily the best cultivation method.

...

There was a lake in a huge land within the Territorial Lord Mansion and Jian Wushuang could be seen dressed in gold while fishing peacefully on the lake with a fish basket beside him.

Not far away, Xiao Tiexin and another two maids stood quietly without saying a word.

The entire mansion seemed extremely quiet.

Suddenly, a figure appeared from the edge of the land. It was Cang Heng.

At his first glance, Cang Heng saw Jian Wushuang fishing peacefully in the middle of the lake and dared not immediately disturb Jian Wushuang. Instead, he went to Xiao Tiexin’s side.
