Chapter 3200: Black Devil Domain

_________________

There were all kinds of secret techniques in the secret technique pavilion of the Temporal Temple. There were many of them, and they were all of the very high levels.

For example, many of the secret techniques on the first level of the secret technique pavilion were created by many Principles Master.

The secret techniques on the second level were created by some powerful Principles Masters, including those who stood at the peak level. Many of them were shockingly famous in the Divine Beginning Realm.

As for the third level, there was only one space-time divine technique.

And the Black Devil secret technique was one of the most famous secret techniques among the hundred or so secret techniques in the second level of the secret technique pavilion.

The creator of this secret technique, the Master of Black Devil, was an exceptional mission that stirred up the storm in the Divine Beginning Realm many years ago. His strength was definitely at the top among the Principles Masters. The Black Devil secret technique he created…and powerful.

However, it was very difficult to master this secret technique. Duan Lang had been practicing this secret technique all this time and had also practiced it to a small success. This was already very good in the eyes of many people, but now Duan Lang can cast this secret skill, can form the Black Devil Domain unexpectedly.

This Black Devil Domain is the domain of the Black Devil which can only be controlled by the master of the Black Devil’s secret arts.

Once the Black Devil Domain was completed, not only would Duan Lang’s strength increase significantly, but more importantly, his perceptive ability would increase by more than ten times!

In the center of the Black Ripple Domain, Duan Lang’s face was cold and his eyes were like torches. With the help of the Black Devil Domain, he found Jian Wushuang’s location in an instant.

“There.”

Duan Lang’s eyes seemed to have two flashes of lightning shooting toward an empty space. At the same time, he moved.

As If teleporting, Duan Lang appeared in the void. At the same time, the purple demonic spear in his hand immediately brought out endless power.

A large amount of purple light gathered in the spear, and the vast power of space-time principles surged into the spear.

“Black magic dragon divine spear!”

Duan Lang let out a roar and thrust the purple spear forward. In an instant, an earth-shaking dragon roar spread crazily.

The whole world was stirred, and a large number of black ripples spread out crazily. This extremely fierce and terrifying spear thrust directly toward the seemingly empty void in front of him.

This void was where Jian Wushuang was hiding.

“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed greatly. He did not expect Duan Lang to be able to find him in an instant after using this secret skill.

When the terrifying spear thrust toward him, he was the first to react.

Wushuang’s Sword Technique, Xi Xiang!

Whoosh!

A blood-red sword light suddenly slashed out. At this moment, Jian Wushuang also unleashed his power to the limit, wanting to block the spear head-on.

But in the end…

Clang!

When the two came into contact, Jian Wushuang instantly felt a majestic power from the spear.

This power was not something he could withstand with the Xi Xiang move.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s sword move collapsed, and the shocking power from the long pincers still hit his divine body.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The void suddenly exploded, and Jian Wushuang’s body was sent flying to the edge of the battlefield. His divine body kept trembling, and it took him a long time to recover.

“What a terrifying spear move!”

“Not only did it defeat my Xi Xiang first style in an instant, but it also directly hit my divine body, causing it to collapse by nearly 40%!”

Jian Wushuang stood there and looked at Duan Lang in front of him, but his heart was in turmoil. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Duan Lang’s spear move was indeed extremely terrifying. Jian Wushuang was sure that the power of this spear move was definitely not weaker than the full-strength attack of the Invincible Saint. It should be Duan Lang’s most powerful move.

“Fortunately, I reacted quickly and immediately used the Xi Xiang move. If it hadn’t been for the defense of the Xi Xiang move, his spear move could still shatter my divine body through my golden armor,” Jian Wushuang secretly exclaimed.

The Xi Xiang first move was the most powerful attack in the Wushuang Sword Manual. He tried his best to block Duan Lang’s spear, but his divine body still collapsed by nearly 40%, the power of Duan Lang’s spear could be imagined.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

A cold voice sounded. Duan Lang stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold gaze. “Your body-protection ability is not weak. I have studied that spear for thousands of years and used it with the black demon secret skill. How could it only destroy 30-40% of your divine body?

“However, although it didn’t completely destroy your divine body, I have the Black Devil Realm. Your escape skill is useless to me. Without it, you’re no match for me!”

“Admit defeat!”

Duan Lang said it bluntly.

When the surrounding Principles Masters heard this, they all nodded in unison.

Indeed, at first, they thought Duan Lang was going to lose because Jian Wushuang’s shadowless escape skill was too strange. They thought Duan Lang would only be a living target in front of Jian Wushuang. But now…when they saw Duan Lang use the Black Devil Realm, they knew Duan Lang was going to win.

Because the Black Devil Realm could increase Duan Lang’s perception by more than ten times, it was just enough to counter the shadowless escape technique. As long as Jian Wushuang had nowhere to hide, he would definitely be inferior to Duan Lang in terms of strength.

Even Temple Master Bai Xing, who had always been indifferent and had absolute confidence in Jian Wushuang, frowned slightly at this moment.

Obviously, Duan Lang had cultivated the Black Devil Realm to the profound realm, which was something she had not expected.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and stared at Duan Lang, but a smile suddenly appeared on his face. “You want me to admit defeat?

“It’s not that easy. Duan Lang, you are indeed very strong, much stronger than any of the Immortal Saints I’ve fought with. But because of that, in order to respect you, I will give it my all!

“My best?”

When the spectators heard this, their expressions became strange.

Jian Wushuang’s words clearly meant that he had not used his full strength until now?

“Humph, you’re talking big. Aren’t you afraid of losing your tongue? If you have any other tricks, just bring them out.” Duan Lang’s voice was low, but his brows were full of confidence.

He did have the right to be confident.

His strength was already extremely strong, and he was the best among the Peak Saints. Now that he had cultivated the Black Devil secret skill to the profound realm, he could even fight with the Invincible Saint, how could he take Jian Wushuang seriously.

Jian Wushuang did not speak again, but the divine power aura of the sixth level ultimate True Saint began to rise at an alarming speed.
