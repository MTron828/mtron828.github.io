Chapter 1806: Ancient Behind-The-Scene Stories (Part 2)

“My injury…” Dao Yuanzi smiled bitterly, “Master, my injury wasn’t caused by a vigorous fight with an expert but when the war was coming to an end, an expert made a formation that was barbaric and extremely terrifying. It forcefully absorbed all my divine power, including my blood essence.”

“Formation?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Not only myself, but many experts who participated in the war also got their divine power and blood essence forcefully absorbed by the formation. After that, I was forced into a deep sleep and started to recover my power over the years. At first, although I was in a bad shape, as long as I am given enough time, I could recover. But who knows, since the war ended, the spiritual energy in the universe became thin at a terrifying speed.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“In less than ten thousand years, it was thin to a point I never imagined. In such an environment, my injury couldn’t recover. Previously, when I created a Blood Devil clone, I spent years accumulating, but now, if the spiritual energy here hasn’t become intense again. I don’t know how long I have to take to recover,” Dao Yuanzi said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood but he was shocked.

According to what Dao Yuanzi said, there were many ancient experts that hadn’t died but were forced into a deep sleep because their divine power and blood essence were forcefully absorbed by the formation. As the spiritual energy was too thin, they couldn’t recover.

But then… With the formation that his Master Xuan Yi set up, the spiritual energy of the ancient battlefield was recovering quickly. By then, it had already reached the level of the ten sanctuaries in Eternal Chaotic World and it was recovering continuously.

According to the recovery rate, it was just a matter of time until it reached the standard of ancient times. But then, the ancient experts who were in deep sleep in the ancient battlefield, would they wake up?

“Very possible!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Dao Yuanzi could recover and the other ancient experts definitely could too. It was just a matter of time.

Then, Jian Wushuang continued to ask Dao Yuanzi about the matters in ancient times.

As Jian Wushuang got a simple understanding of ancient times, he was ever more astonished.

The ferocity of ancient times was totally beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination.

After a few questions, Jian Wushuang paused and said, “Last question… Do you know an expert named Xuan Yi?”

“Xuan Yi?” Dao Yuanzi’s face changed. His eyes looked horrified.

“It seems like you know him,” Jian Wushuang could see the change in Dao Yuanzi’s expression through Blood Mountain Sword.

“No, I don’t know him but I have heard of him,” Dao Yuanzi said. “During the battle back then, although I didn’t know the reason behind the explosion of the way, I knew that it was related to an expert named Xuan Yi. Besides, at the end of the war, the person who set up the huge formation to forcefully absorb every expert’s divine power and blood essence… was Xuan Yi!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang quivered.

The formation that appeared in the end of the ancient war to absorb the experts’ divine power and blood essence which caused ancient experts into a deep sleep was set up by Xuan Yi?

Why?

“Master…” Jian Wushuang muttered. He wanted to know more about ancient times and the behind-the-scenes stories of the ancient war.

It was a pity that Dao Yuanzi was only a nonentity in the ancient war. He knew too little.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t determine what had happened.

But Jian Wushuang was sure about one thing. His Master Xuan Yi was definitely related to the ancient war.

The formation that could blend in with the Spacetime Storm surrounding the battlefield was also created by Xuan Yi. Its goal was not only to protect Green Fire World, but also to improvised the environment of the ancient battlefield. In turn, the experts who were in deep sleep in the battlefield could wake up.

“Master, who are you exactly? And what are you trying to do?” Jian Wushuang bellowed in his heart.

But he couldn’t get any answer as of now.

He had to grow stronger if he wanted to know. At least, he had to be on the peak of Eternal Chaotic World that could be evenly matched with Great Emperor.

Jian Wushuang shook his head but didn’t think further.

“Dao Yuanzi, remove owner recognition on your Qian Kun ring and give it to me,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

The corners of Dao Yuanzi’s lips twitched but he didn’t hesitate. He immediately removed owner recognition on his Qian Kun ring.

Jian Wushuang flipped his palm and Dao Yuanzi’s Qian Kun ring was in his hands. Then, Jian Wushuang immediately started to inspect it.

Dao Yuanzi was an ancient expert after all. Although he wasn’t anything big in ancient times, he was considered a super expert in Eternal Chaotic World. The things that he had in his Qian Kun ring were priceless.

Of course, because of severe injury, the elixirs and many natural treasures in Dao Yuanzi’s Qian Kung ring had been used up. There was only some unique treasure left. There were also secret skills and rare books. But these things made Jian Wushuang beam with joy.

“Haha, not bad. In addition to the resources that I obtained from killing many experts over the years, I can make a cultivation sanctuary for Green Fire World, just like Thunderbolt Island in Sanctuary Alliance,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He had killed multiple Sir Gods and even countless Real Gods. He had obtained countless resources that were suitable for cultivation. With the resources and some unique treasures, he should be able to build a Thunderbolt Island. Of course, the Thunderbolt Island was merely a metaphor. It was definitely not compatible with Thunderbolt Island of Sanctuary Alliance.

To Green Fire World where the strongest person was only a Universe God in the Second Heaven, it was too useful.

Even after Green Fire World grew and gave birth to Real God, it would still be useful.

Just then, Jian Wushuang flicked his wrist and a drop of golden blood essence appeared in his hand from nowhere.

The drop of golden blood essence, although its color wasn’t pure, the power contained was enchanting, even for Jian Wushuang. As Jian Wushuang looked at the drop of blood essence, the Ancient God blood essence in Jian Wushuang’s body instantly began to boil too.

“Dao Yuanzi, this should be the ancient tribe blood essence that you were talking about, right?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Yes,” Dao Yuanzi nodded, “I happened to get it by chance. It is blood essence of a pure ancient tribe expert. However, the ancient tribe expert wasn’t strong, merely Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. When I needed to recover my power in deep sleep, I consumed all elixirs and natural treasures but I couldn’t absorb the drop of ancient tribe blood essence.”
