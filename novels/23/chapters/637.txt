Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the battleground, two figures were staring at each other.

“Ouyang Xuan.” Jian Wushuang radiated killing intent, but his heart was quite calm.

Violent but cold.

This was what Jian Wushuang had cultivated while on the edge of life and death so many times in the Ancient World.

“Ouyang Xuan has comprehended the first occult of the Waterdrop Dao and the Gale Dao. He should have made a lot of progress last month, so Chu Yang is far weaker than him,”?Jian Wushuang said to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, I saw your fight with Chu Yang. You’re strong.” Ouyang Xuan said, “I have fought with many people since the beginning of the Firmament Territory Feast, but none of them could force me to exert my full strength. I hope you can do it.”

Many geniuses could not help gasping in surprise.

The strength Ouyang Xuan had displayed was already shocking enough, but he had not gone all out ever since the beginning? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang still looked cold.

Ouyang Xuan had not done his best, but neither had Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, I know you are good at sword principle. So am I.” Ouyang Xuan smiled slightly. He withdrew the folding fan and placed it in his Interspatial Ring, then took out an aquamarine longsword. A soaring sword essence immediately radiated from Ouyang Xuan.

At the same time, a supreme sword essence exploded from Jian Wushuang.

With the two essences colliding in the air, the whole area seemed to come to a standstill.

This was a fight between two sword principle experts.

When the two soaring sword essences collided, the two experts began to move as well.

Whoosh!?Whoosh!

The two figures quickly rushed forward,?leaving behind residual shadows.

After that, two sword lights moved.

“Cataclysm Skill!”

Jian Wushuang slashed out ferociously with the Heart-killing Sword.

“Sword Sea.”

Ouyang Xuan stabbed forward with the sword. Swoosh! A vast ocean was swept toward Jian Wushuang.

However, the collision did not create the violent explosion that everyone expected. Instead, the crowd only heard a squeezing sound.

Jian Wushuang suddenly felt as if he was wrapped by an endless sea. Ouyang Xuan could already use the Waterdrop Dao to the limit of perfection.

“Roll!”

As Jian Wushuang surged forward, a killing intent exploded from his body and shot out like a barrage of sharp swords, striking the rolling sea.

Sword lights flashed throughout the area.

Jian Wushuang waved the Heart-killing Sword while displaying a murderous swordsmanship and a monstrous killing intent.

However, Ouyang Xuan’s swordsmanship was quite flexible, sometimes quick and violent, sometimes soft and durable, just like the roaring sea.

These two completely different types of swordsmanship violently clashed with each other.

“Dang!” “Dang!” “Dang!” “Dang!”

The sound of deep crashes echoed.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship so powerful, he was still unable to break through the surging waves that surrounded him.

As for Ouyang Xuan, he had displayed a marvelous swordsmanship with a perfect application of the Waterdrop and Gale Daos, but he failed to overwhelm the Heart-killing Sword.

“Ouyang Xuan, is this your full strength?” Jian Wushuang sighed and then struck out with the Heart-killing Sword. A soaring killing intent burst from the sword blade, releasing an overwhelming amount of sword shadows that surged towards Ouyang Xuan, colliding with the longsword in his hands.

Dark cyan waves appeared in front of Ouyang Xuan and withstood the monstrous sword shadows.

“Very good.” Ouyang Xuan looked at Jian Wushuang with a glow of excitement in his eyes and said, “You’re the first person here to make me go all out.”

After saying that, Ouyang Xuan placed the aquamarine longsword back in his interspatial?ring and exchanged it for a huge heavy sword.

“A heavy sword? ” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Everyone outside the battleground was very shocked.

Ouyang Xuan had revealed his heavy sword.

“Jian Wushuang, take this attack!”

Ouyang Xuan growled before suddenly appearing in front of Jian Wushuang, swinging the huge heavy sword in a chopping motion towards Jian Wushuang. Swoosh! The sword essence was like an endless torrent of water, inundating Jian Wushuang.

“This is?”

Many experts in the Skyward Pavilion were surprised when they saw the sword skill that was being displayed by Ouyang Xuan.

“It’s the 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun!”

“It is a unique skill for the Waterdrop Dao. It was created by Liu Yun, who is in the Eternal Realm. How did this boy learn it?”

“The 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun is quite valuable. How could someone like Ouyang Xuan, who is only in the Skyscraping Realm, get his hands on it?”

“In the 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun, each successive move is more powerful than the previous one. I wonder how many moves he is capable of displaying with his current comprehension of the Waterdrop Dao.”

Under the watchful eyes of those experts, Ouyang Xuan executed the first move. Jian Wushuang fended it off with all his strength, forcing both of them to take a step back. However, Ouyang Xuan didn’t stop and went on to display the second move, which was more powerful than the first one. Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat by this move.

Without waiting, Ouyang Xuan executed the third move.

As the heavy sword swung out, its power instantly skyrocketed.

“He can display the third move?”

“Since the 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun were not created by him, it is very remarkable for Ouyang Xuan to be able to display the third move while only in the Skyscraping Realm.”

“With this move, Ouyang Xuan can definitely rank in the top 20.”

“Jian Wushuang is going to be defeated!”

On the battleground, Peng!

With a loud boom, everyone witnessed Jian Wushuang being knocked to the ground so forcefully that a hole was left at the point of impact.

Everyone believed that Jian Wushuang had been defeated.

“Bang!”

At this point, the hole suddenly exploded and a figure rushed out into the air. Naturally, it was Jian Wushuang. He didn’t look injured in the least and he even looked excited.

“Hm?” Ouyang Xuan looked at Jian Wushuang with a frown while still holding the heavy sword.

Jian Wushuang had not been injured by that powerful move?

“Ouyang Xuan! You are also the first one here to force me to go all out.” Jian Wushuang said in a loud voice as a burning desire flashed in his eyes.

“He finally decided to use his full power?” Xuan Yi in the Skyward Pavilion narrowed his eyes.

A moment later, Jian Wushuang slashed out with his sword.

In that instant, an intense World Energy surged forward.
