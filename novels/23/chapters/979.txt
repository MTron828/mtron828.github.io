Chapter 980: Menace from Jian Wushuang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Was he threatening them?

Yes, he was.

Everyone knew that.

The three experts were visibly annoyed.

If an average Joe with the Eternal Realm were making this threat, they would shrug it off.

Nevertheless it was not an average Joe. It was an exceptional genius of the Green Fire World.

No one knew what he was capable of, but Master Ku’s invitation sure said a lot.

Even the Void Temple Master wanted to recruit him.

It would be very easy for him to become a Dao Master, or even a Holy Master. It was also possible that he could become someone like the Void Temple Master and Dao Yuanzi.

Most importantly, his battle strength was excellent too.

He was just an expert with Eternal Realm but he managed to resist Master Ku. He would have enough powers to face off against Ape Holy Master when he became a Dao Master.

Just like he had said, in 10,000 years, he would be able to come back and annihilate all the experts of the three big countries.

“Jian Wushuang, are you threatening me?”

Ape Holy Master was blue with anger, he stared at Jian and continued, “You’d have to live another 10,000 years for everything you just said to be true. If I kill you now, none of that will happen.”

“You’re right,” Jian Wushuang nodded and said. “Killing me now would stop me from killing you in the future, but I’d bet big money you can’t kill me now.”

Jian Wushuang smiled confidently.

Ape Holy Master was getting angrier.

Was he willing to bet big money on whether or not he could kill Jian Wushuang right there right then?

No, he was not. He even had no idea if he could beat Jian Wushuang at that moment.

He dared not to bet on himself killing Jian Wushuang not only because of the powers that Jian Wushuang had just showed off when fighting Master Ku, but also because of the battle 1,200 years ago.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had exploded into a blood fog in the end.

Normally people would die when this happened, but…

After 1,200 years, Jian was still alive and well and he was even more powerful than before.

This was too weird. As such, Ape Holy Master was not sure if he could kill him.

“What’re we going to do?”

West Paradise Emperor and Nan Paradise Emperor asked.

“There’s nothing we can do. He’s threatening us, and I’m not sure if I can kill him. We can’t bet the fate of our countries on him not becoming a Dao Master,” Ape Holy Master said coldly.

He believed that Jian Wushuang could definitely become a Dao Master.

“You mean we back off?” West Paradise Emperor asked.

It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the three big countries this time; they were just one step away from wiping out Tang of the East.

Just one step away.

If they stopped now, they probably would never find another opportunity like this. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“We’ve got no other choice,” Ape Holy Master sighed and said. “Who’d have thought Tang of the East got such a savior at the last moment?”

“Jian Wushuang.”

Ape Holy Master turned to look at Jian again. “We’ve decided to retreat.”

They had no other option but to give up.

They were so close!

“That’s not good enough for me,” Jian Wushaung shook his head.

“What else do you want?” Ape Holy Master shouted, anger flickering in his eyes.

They promised to give up but Jian was still not satisfied.

“Hmm, you’re being forced by me to retreat now, but I can’t be here forever. Can you promise that you won’t come back when I’m gone?” Jian said coldly.

“What?” It was getting harder and harder for Ape Holy Master to control his anger.

“I want you guys to swear you won’t come to attack us again for the next 100,000 years. If you say yes, I’ll let this go,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You want us to swear?” It was hard for the three masters to believe what they had just heard.

They were the top guys in the Gree Fire World and now they were being forced to make a promise like this.

Emperor Xiao and the other experts inside the imperial palace nodded when they heard Jian Wushuang’s words.

Ten thousand years was not long, but it would be long enough for Tang of the East to get itself together.

They would be ready to resist the three big countries when they came back for them after 100,000 years.

They believed that the three top-notch experts would not break a promise they made in front of so many witnesses.

If Ape Holy Master agreed with what Jian had proposed, it would be great for Tang of the East.

Ape Holy Master thought for a while and came to a conclusion.

“Fine, I promise,” Ape Holy Master said coldly.

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang smiled in satisfaction.

The other two masters were not happy about it, but again, they had no other choice. They had to promise Jian Wushuang too.

A golden-robed elder watched all this happening in front of him, while hiding himself in the shadows.

“Interesting.”

The elder said to himself and then dashed out of the shadows.
