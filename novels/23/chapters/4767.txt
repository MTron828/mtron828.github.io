4771 The Arrival of Uncle Yu

Under the Fusang Tree, Zheng Ying turned back to look at the figure that had already disappeared into the distance. She seemed to have understood a little.

After a few breaths, just as the Fusang Tree completely collapsed, her figure also disappeared quietly.

“Brother Jian, we’ll be able to leave the Celestial Prefecture in half a day at most. Have you found the thing you need?” Cheng Qing asked.

Jian Wushuang did not speak but looked at Yin Ling, who was following him closely.

“Don’t worry. As long as we get out of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, I’ll give you what you want immediately,” Yin Ling patted her chest and proudly smiled.

Jian Wushuang’s face stiffened and he turned his head to the side.

Seeing this, Cheng Qing and Chun Qiu both had strange expressions.

“Isn’t this woman Prince Mo’s woman?” Cheng Qing’s expression was somewhat startled.

Hearing this, Yin Ling sniffed. “Hey, silly big guy, which eye of yours saw that I’m Prince Mo’s woman?”

“I was merely imprisoned by his side. Now that he’s dead, I’m free.”

Cheng Qing pouted, but did not say anything.

Four completely hidden figures were rapidly leaving.

However, in the next moment, Jian Wushuang felt great danger.

As if to confirm his thoughts, the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, which had been plunged into crimson and darkness, began to be illuminated by a white-gold light.

Then, just as Jian Wushuang and the others were about to step out of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, an invisible and hazy barrier appeared outside the boundary of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

“This is bad!” Jian Wushuang’s heart sank and he felt a chill.

When Cheng Qing and the others saw this, their hearts also sank to the bottom.

The entire shattered Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture had been sealed off by an external force!

Only those existences could seal the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture with such a powerful force. Even Grand Yan Immortals could not do it.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with solemness and bitterness.

“Brother Jian, what should we do? Should we force our way out?” Chen Qing said in a serious tone as a ruthless glint appeared in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, “From now on, we can’t use Yan power. This barrier is definitely not something we can break through. Let’s just wait and see.”

After saying this, he brought the three of them to land directly in a shattered Immortal estate pavilion and concealed all of his aura.

In the broken sky, hundreds of millions of white-gold light beams shot up into the sky!

At the same time, more than a dozen Elders with light wheels of various colors on their backs were approaching on clouds.

Di Qing, who was still fighting in the sky, also noticed this scene.

“Damned fool, just wait for your death!” One of the Grand Yan Immortals fighting Di Qing shouted in anger, wishing he could tear Di Qing apart.

Di Qing retracted his palm and looked at the old men standing in the clouds, a great fear flashing through his eyes.

The two Grand Yan Immortals looked at each other, then they suddenly fled to the left and right.

“Evil creature!”

One of the Elders with a black light wheel on his back raised his palm and pressed down. Even though they were millions of miles away, he still captured a Grand Yan Immortal who was escaping.

At the same time, an old man with a scarlet wheel of light on his back took out a palm-sized porcelain bottle and directly absorbed another Grand Yan Immortal!

In the blink of an eye, the two escaping Grand Yan Immortals were both caught.

Then, the old man with the black light wheel used his great divine ability to squeeze the two Grand Yan Immortals into the size of pellets.

“The Fifth Young Lord, did you kill him?” The majestic sound of a great bell reverberated throughout the Celestial Prefecture.

The two Grand Yan Immortals, who were originally insufferably arrogant, were now scared out of their wits.

This was because they saw an ordinary-looking old man in a black robe slowly walking over.

This old man was Uncle Yu, the most mysterious Elder behind Emperor Zhen Wuyang.

“It’s… It’s none of our business. We’re just passing by. We didn’t kill the Fifth Prince. He was killed by someone else!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

They still wanted to say something, but the black-robed old man just waved his hand at them, and their divine souls and Immortal Sources were completely destroyed.

What kind of terrifying strength was this, to destroy a Grand Yan immortal without even releasing Yan power?

His wrinkled face seemed to contain all the vicissitudes of life and secrets of the world. Finally, he looked at Di Qing not far away with his turbid eyes.

Di Qing slowly took half a step back and stared at him.

“The Fifth Prince, did you kill him?” A hoarse voice came. Uncle Yu’s eyes were so calm that they seemed to have stopped time.

Even the proud Di Qing had to lower his head at this moment.

“No, and it’s impossible for him to be killed by me. He was killed by his accomplices. A woman personally cut off Young Master Mo’s head and destroyed his Immortal Source,” Di Qing pointed at the five swordsmen in the distance and said in a deep voice.

Uncle Yu’s face was expressionless. He slowly reached out his hand from his sleeve and clenched his fist in the air.

As he grabbed, the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, which was already on the verge of destruction, shattered even faster. Whether it was Immortal mansions, pavilions, or thousands of living beings, they were all inevitably turned into fine powder.

“Since that’s the case, all of you will be buried with the Fifth Prince.” Gu Ji’s old voice resounded.

Uncle Yu’s voice was like the Great Dao, which caused the irreversible defeat of the entire Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

Di Qing’s pupils suddenly narrowed, and he took a few steps back as he said, “What do you mean? I’ve already told you the real murderer, why don’t you let me go?”

“The death of the Fifth Prince is related to the entire Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture. Naturally, all of you will be buried with him.” Uncle Yu’s voice was indifferent and unquestionable.

Di Qing’s face turned livid. “Do you think you can defeat me like this? If I leave, no one will be able to stop me!”

With that, a huge Golden Crow image bloomed behind Di Qing, and his whole body was filled with a faint majesty.

Facing a dozen Grand Yan Immortals with light wheels on their backs and the unfathomable Uncle Yu, he chose to fight!

However, before the battle even began, Uncle Yu pointed his finger at Di Qing. A dark beam of light pierced through the void, tore Di Qing’s Golden Crow form apart, and easily shattered his Immortal Source.

Deathly silence, an extreme deathly silence.

Di Qing, who was arrogant enough to fight against two people alone, had his Immortal Source shattered just like that.

The shattering of the Immortal Source meant irreversible damage, and it symbolized a Yan Immortal’s final death sentence.

Di Qing died just like that. Thousands of feathers were stripped from his body and scattered in the void.

Then, his body plunged into the shattered Celestial Prefecture.

After killing Di Qing, Uncle Yu raised his arms again. Under his control, the entire Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture was crushed into powder.

Even Yan Immortals would not be able to survive.

With the death of the Fifth Prince, the trillions of living beings in the entire Celestial Prefecture had also been buried with him.

No top cultivator or Yan Immortal could escape from Uncle Yu’s Dao.

However, there should be an exception to everything.
