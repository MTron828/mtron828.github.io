Chapter 313: It’s Time for Revenge!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Sword Realm!”

Suddenly, Sword Essence erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body, forming a horrifying Sword Realm, which superimposed with the Blood River.

The combination of Road to the Underworld, Slaughter Domain, and Sword Sea!

Rumble ~ ~ ~ The Bloody River surged up, in all directions, with a terrifying and overwhelming force.

“This...”??After feeling the power of the Blood River, even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help shuddering with fear.

“What terrifying power! The power alone can prevent common Saint Realm experts from exerting even one-tenth of their power while trapped in the Blood River.”?Jian Wushang exclaimed. But he also noticed that more than one half of his Spiritual Power had already been consumed. He immediately stopped applying the Road to the Underworld out of fear.

The surging blood river slowly disappeared and the world became peaceful once again, leaving Jian Wushang standing there with a sweaty forehead.

“The Road to the Underworld really is a secret art that exceeds first-grade techniques. Its power is very strong, but at the same time it consumes a huge amount of Spiritual Power,”?Jian Wushuang said to himself.

He finally understood why this secret art had such a high cultivation requirement. Generally, it could only be reluctantly exerted by experts in the Saint Realm.

That was because it consumed too much Spiritual Power.

From the time he activated it until just now, which covered only a dozen breaths, more than half of Jian Wushang’s Spiritual Power had been consumed. If he continued to use it, his Spiritual Power would have been completely exhausted.

Moreover, it was only because of the Heavenly Creation Skill, which granted him ten times more Spiritual Power than other experts at his rank, that he could sustain it for so long. If Jian Wushuang was just a common warrior at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, even consuming all of his Spiritual Power wouldn’t be enough to display the Road to the Underworld.

“With my current Spiritual Power, if I do my best to exert the Road to the Underworld while combining it with the Slaughter Domain and the Sword Sea, I could sustain it for twenty breathes at most,”?Jian Wushuang told to himself.

Just twenty breathes was too short.

“Since it consumes so much Spiritual Power, I’d better not use the Road to the Underworld unless it is completely necessary. In an ordinary fight, I should only depend on my Domain and the Sword Sea. That should be enough.”?Jian Wushuang thought deeply.?“After all, I still have the Triple-kill Sword.”

Jian Wushuang turned his palm upwards, and the Triple-kill Sword appeared in his hand.

After upgrading to a first-grade magic weapon, the Triple-skill Sword radiated hostility that was several times stronger than before. Now, this sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand was surging with a level of hostility that was hard to ignore.

“The Triple-skill Sword is of too high a grade and too powerful, and it should be my trump card in the future. As for ordinary fights, the Purple Sky Sword is enough.”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was carrying a purple longsword on his back, the sword that was presented to him by Leng Rushuang. It was also a superior third-grade magic weapon, so It was strong enough to deal with most normal opponents or experts.

The Triple-skill Sword and the Road to the Underworld would become Jian Wushuang’s trump cards in the future.

Just like the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, they were all trump cards.

“Now everything is ready. Next, it’s time for revenge!”?Jian Wushang’s eyes became cold as killing intention surged through his heart.

He was a man who believed in “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.” He made sure to do things vigorously and effectively.

Once it’s time for revenge, never postpone!

As for the Holy Emperor Palace, he had to tolerate them temporarily because he was not powerful enough.

But Tan Feng... A month ago, that guy had chased him and wanted to kill him in such a horrible fashion. Now, Jian Wushuang’s strength had increased, and the first thing he intended to do was to kill that guy!

“With my current strength, I’m confident I can kill him!”

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushang immediately set off.

...

Tan Feng, who ranked 9th on the Bloodmoon list, was quite famous in the Tang Dynasty. Not only that, he was also the Mansion Master of the Ninth Heaven Mansion, which was one of the 21 large prefectures in the Tang Dynasty.

Tan Feng was earnestly cultivating every day in the Ninth Heaven Mansion, so it was very easy to locate him.

After traveling for three days, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Ninth Heaven Mansion, but his current appearance was different.

A figure wearing a blood-red robe, a wicked blood-red mask, and carrying a long sword on his back, appeared at the void above the Ninth Heaven Mansion. An overwhelming killing intent was radiating from the figure.

“Who is that?”

The incredibly killing intent caused a commotion inside the Ninth Heaven Mansion. After which, one figure after another rushed into the sky. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Among them, the leader was a brown-haired man carrying a giant axe on his back, whose cultivation had reached the Half-saint level.

Yet, the Mansion Master, Tan Feng, had not appeared.

“This man has such a strong killing intent.”?The brown-haired man carrying the Giant Axe looked at Jian Wushuang. After narrowing his eyes, the man asked, “Who are you?”

“Nan,” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

“Nan, No. 36 at the Bloodmoon List?” The face of the brown-haired man slightly changed.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang was earnestly cultivating inside the Heartless Sect, Nan, his Slaughter Doppelganger, had been roaming around the Tang Dynasty and fighting. So, he had also become quite famous, ranking 36th on the Bloodmoon List.

The brown-haired man, as well as the other experts in the Ninth Heaven Mansion, had certainly heard of Nan.

“Mr. Nan, why are you here at our Ninth Heaven Mansion?” The brown-haired man asked coldly.

“I come here for Tan Feng. Bring him out!” Jian Wushuang directly answered.

The face of the brown-haired man changed at once. “Our Mansion Master is an important person! How dare you ask to see him?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were ice cold as he glanced at the brown-haired man and said, in a low voice, “You just need to tell him that I’m here to claim his life!”

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s word, the brown-haired man and the many experts of the Ninth Heaven Mansion were immediately stunned.

That brown-haired man instantly became enraged.

“What a reckless bastard, where are you from? You dare to challenge our Mansion Master??Get lost!”

With a furious shout, the thick giant axe appeared in his hand. Then, a harsh air bursting sound was suddenly heard as a humongous axe shadow appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

An axe shadow, which seemed like a small mountain, rushed forward in an attempt to directly suppress Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang slightly raised his head and glanced at the mountainous axe shadow with cold eyes. Then, crack!

The longsword was unsheathed and a flash of sword shadow instantly swept out.

So fast!

It was so fast that nobody there had seen the sword’s path. After which, Jian Wushuang resheathed the purple long sword. He was still standing there with little movement.

In front of him,?the figure of the brown-haired man began to slowly descend. The brown-haired man’s eyes were wide open and there was a very clear line of blood on his face, extending from the center of his eyebrows to his jaw.

In the next instant, the cold corpse of the brown-haired man began falling towards the ground below.

The experts from the Ninth Heaven Mansion were stunned.

A Half-saint expert, who also ranked very high on the Bloodmoon List, was killed by a single sword move?

After killing that brown-haired man, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were still incredibly cold as he suddenly released a furious shout that echoed throughout the whole sky.

“Tan Feng, come out!”
