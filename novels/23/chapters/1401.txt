Chapter 1402: I refuse to accept!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the boundless Milky Way, Hall Palace Yuan, Lei Chao and the other dozens of deacon elderly gathered together.

“I drafted a disciple name list of who is going to join the second rotation battle. Look and see if there’s any problem,” Hall Master Yuan showed the name list to everyone.

In Hall Master’s point of view, his drafted name list naturally wouldn’t have any problems. The deacon elderlies only casually took a glance and they agreed in unison.

The name list in their heart was the same as the name list that Hall Master Yuan showed them.

“As there’s no problem, let me announce the results.”

Hall Palace Yuan took a stride and his lofty voice reverberated throughout the entire Titanic Star.

“Whoever’s name is called up can join the second round of the rotation battle!”

Every disciple in Titanic Star held their breath and waited.

“Ling Feibai!”

Ling Feibai was the first who was called, no one was surprised. He was widely acknowledged as the top genius.

Then, the other three disciples of Star Palace were called, including Xia Feng.

They were followed by Luo Quan and the others.

Hall Palace Yuan read nine names altogether. At the tenth, he paused slightly.

Hall Master Yuan had yet to read out the name but disciples on Titanic Star couldn’t help but look towards Lu Han.

Everyone saw their performance in Supreme Tower more clearly. As for the duration they stayed in Supreme Tower, Lu Han was at the tenth. In other words, the last person’s name should be his.

“According to the duration one stayed in Supreme Tower, the last name is definitely mine,’ Lu Han was confident.

Hall Master Yuan finally spoke.

“The last one… Jian Wushuang!”

Just as he finished the announcement, all the disciples on Titanic Star were surprised.

Lu Han who was full of confidence suddenly flushed with anger.

“Jian Wushuang? How could it be Jian Wushuang?”

Lu Han roared. His bloodshot eyes fixed their gaze on Jian Wushuang. However, he saw Jian Wushuang stood there coldly and didn’t bother with his gaze or the surrounding crowd’s gaze.

“No, impossible!”

Lu Han started bellowing in anger, “According to the duration we stayed in Supreme Tower, I stayed for one breath longer than Jian Wushuang. I am above him. How could the last quota for second rotation battle not be my name, but his?”

“This is unfair!”

“I refuse to accept this!”

Lu Han’s bellows reverberated through the entire Titanic Star and many disciples creased their eyebrows.

Most of these disciples agreed with what Lu Han said.

When Jian Wushuang first came to Lineage of Star and showed his ability, it had stirred up a commotion in Lineage of Star.

A disciple of Star Place was far behind an ordinary disciple of the same rank.

By then, most of them already found it unfair.

However, due to the battle approaching, the commotion subsided. Then, before everyone’s eyes, everyone could tell that Lu Han had stayed longer than Jian Wushuang in the Supreme Tower. But the last quota was still given to Jian Wushuang. It was not only Lu Han who had refused to accept the result, but the other disciples too.

Lu Han even glared at Hall Master Yuan and other higher-ups in the boundless Milky Way. He continued to rage, “This is not fair, I will not accept this!”

Although even if he were to participate in the second rotation battle, it was impossible for him to grab the quota to become disciples of Star Palace. At least he tried.

But then, he didn’t even have a chance.

Plus, if Jian Wushuang did win against him with his ability, so be it. The most important part was that Jian Wushuang obviously couldn’t compare favorably with him in regards of duration in Supreme Tower.

Of course, he refused to accept it.

Looking at the scene on Titanic Star, Hall Master Yuan squinted his eyes while the other deacon elderlies looked embarrassed.

“The result was a mutual decision of Hall Master Yuan and all the deacon elderlies. We all agreed that Jian Wushuang is more qualified to participate in the second rotation battle than you, Lu Han,” one of the deacon elderlies shouted. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mutual decision?” All the disciples on Titanic Star stunned.

If it was only Hall Master Yuan who was biased, so be it. But all the deacon elderlies had mutually agreed with the result. It couldn’t be that all the deacon elderlies were biased, right?

“Lu Han!”

A cold voice was heard. The one who spoke was Lei Chao.

“Lei, Mister Lei Chao,” Lu Han quivered and there was a flash of terror in his eyes.

“I know that you stayed longer in the Supreme Tower than Jian Wushuang. You think that he couldn’t be compared favorably to you, so it’s normal that you refuse to accept the result. However, if you’re unhappy with the result, you can continue to watch the battle. Watch the second rotation battle and see Jian Wushuang’s power with your own eyes, complain then. Now… Hall Master Yuan just announced the result and you question the result. Humph. You have guts. Do you think you’re Ling Feibai?” Lei Chao’s voice was cold.

Lu Han quivered in shock and he suddenly awakened.

True. Regardless, he was merely an ordinary disciple in Lineage of Star. There were many ordinary disciples of his standard in Lineage of Star.

Then, he who was an ordinary disciple pointed a finger at Hall Master Yuan and questioned the result of the discussion amongst Hall Master Yuan and the other deacon elderlies.

“I… am I crazy?” Lu Han quivered.

Then, Hall Master Yuan finally looked down at Lu Han. His voice was extremely cold too, “Stand by the side and watch. If, when the second rotation battle ends, you still think that Jian Wushuang shouldn’t be compared favorably with you, I will give you what you deserve and I will apologize to everyone and admit that I’m biased. However, if Jian Wushuang were to be stronger than you, then you… you will return to where you came from.”

Then, everyone on Titanic Star gasped and looked at Lu Han simultaneously.

Return to where you came from. It meant that he would be kicked out from Lineage of Star!

“I, I…” Lu Han was extremely shocked. He mumbled but couldn’t utter another word.

“Alright, be prepared for the second rotation battle,” Hall Master Yuan waved his hand impatiently.

Along with Hall Master Yuan’s instruction, the battle continued.

After the chaos that Lu Han caused, everyone who was originally still doubtful of Jian Wushuang’s capability didn’t dare to think so anymore.

“Hall Master Yuan and the rest of the deacon elderlies think that Jian Wushuang is stronger than Lu Han?”

“If it was just Hall Master Yuan, it wouldn’t be a big deal. The crucial part is that all deacon elderlies thought so too. It definitely isn’t because Hall Master Yuan is biased but Jian Wushuang really has the ability.”

“Definitely. Otherwise, why would Hall Master Yuan say so and even promise to apologize publicly? From what I can see, Hall Master Yuan wouldn’t apologize if Lu Han is doomed.”
