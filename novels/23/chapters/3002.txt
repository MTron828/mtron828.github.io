Chapter 3003: Pursuit!

——

“It seems that the experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom have been alerted by my slaughter,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

According to the information given to him by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, his target had always been to live alone in the mansion. Few experts would stay with him. However, when he arrived this time, he had just started to cover his soul, he did not find any True Saint, so he made his move.

Unexpectedly, as soon as he made his move, three powerful True Saints immediately appeared in the mansion.

Two peak rank two True Saints and a rank three True Saint!

This scared Jian Wushuang, and he chose to flee without hesitation. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

These True Saints obviously did not intend to let him go, so they followed him to kill him.

“Hunting…it’s been a long time.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

In his previous life, he had been hunted down many times when he was still weak.

Every time, he had narrowly escaped death.

But in this life, although he had been cultivating for hundreds of years, it seemed to be the first time he was being hunted down.

“But this is what I want.” Jian Wushuang thought. “Only in this way can I have a sense of adventure, and only in this way can I inspire my courage!”

Jian wushuang clenched his hands and looked behind him. “Come on, this time I’m going to take risks and stimulate myself. I hope you can force me into a desperate situation. This is the only way I can find a chance to break through!”

Jian Wushuang was not nervous at all. On the contrary, he was looking forward to it.

Not far behind him, four True Saint experts were following Jian Wushuang closely.

One of the four people on the must-kill list was a black-robed elder with an evil aura.

The black-robed elder’s face was cold and his eyes were indescribably cold, but he was secretly glad. “Fortunately, I was alert after receiving the message and invited three good friends to hide in my mansion as soon as possible. Otherwise…”

The black-robed elder could not imagine what he would become if he did not have these three good friends.

After all, he was only a rank two True Saint, and his strength was inferior to that of Holy Master Huocang.

Even Holy Master Huocang was killed by him. If he met him alone, he would definitely die.

Fortunately, he was smart and reacted quickly!

“I’m not dead, so he’s the one who’s going to die now!” The black-robed elder stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

The three people next to him also had solemn expressions.

“This expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is so fast!” A short-haired man in a short robe said in a low voice.

This short-haired man was the strongest among the four, the sect master of the third rank True Saint Gold Mountain!

“He is indeed fast. His comprehension of the laws of space and time should be extremely high. With just a few of us, it will be very difficult for us to catch up to him,” said a young lady dressed in green beside him.

“Don’t be anxious. I have already reported this matter to Lord Wu. Lord Wu has already rushed here as fast as he can. In addition, he has already mobilized powerful experts from the nearby territories and is currently rushing here as well. As long as we can follow him and report his location to him at any time, our people will be able to think of a way to form an encirclement around him. At that time, it will be difficult for him to escape even if he has wings!” The last white-haired man said.

“Right, he must die!” The black-robed old man said coldly as well.

…

At the edge of this realm, in a secluded valley, there was a hidden spatial tunnel.

Light shone and five figures walked out from the spatial tunnel in succession. The person in the lead was the purple-robed old man who had gone to the Divine Hall to meet with the Magic Note King previously, the purple-robed elder was the Master Wu whom the Golden Mountain Sect Master and the others had mentioned.

Master Wu’s position in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was second only to that of the Magic Note King.

The impact of this incident was so great that even the king was furious. Therefore, Master Wu had personally asked about Jian Wushuang’s death.

“We are only at the edge of this realm. We are still far away from where the Golden Mountain Sect Master and the others are. I’m afraid we won’t be able to get there in time.” Master Wu narrowed his eyes and muttered, “Where are the others?”

“Lord Wu, after your orders were given, not only this realm but also the surrounding realms, as long as there are experts who are at the True Saint-level or above, they will all rush over as quickly as possible. Right now, there are already eighteen experts who have arrived near the sect leader of the Golden Mountain Sect.” A True Saint behind him said.

“Eighteen?” Lord Wu frowned. “Not enough, not enough. Tell the others to hurry over. Besides, that person from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is not weak. He could even kill Holy Master Huocang. Moreover, he seems to have the ‘burning god’ poison, which is used to counter the immortal body. Under such circumstances, even two or three rank one True Saints working together would not be enough to defeat him.”

“We shouldn’t be too scattered. It’s best if we have a few more people working together. Don’t give him the chance to break them one by one.”

“Yes.” That True Saint nodded respectfully.

“Has he arrived?” Lord Wu asked again.

“Not yet, but he will arrive soon. In addition, our people have already sent a suppression type holy treasure to the Golden Mountain sect master,” that True Saint said.

“Very good.” Lord Wu nodded slightly.

They had to be fully prepared for the siege.

Although Jian Wushuang’s aura was only that of a Divine Master, everyone thought that he was just hiding his aura. His true realm must be above the True Saint realm.

To deal with the True Saint realm, of course, they had to use all kinds of methods.

They were prepared for the soul annihilation and the suppression of the treasure.

“Let’s go!”

Lord Wu and the others also rushed there.

…

In the vast void, Jian Wushuang was still running forward rapidly.

While he was running, he found that there were many more auras around him.

“They are really fast. In such a short time, so many experts have gathered. They are worthy of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.” Jian Wushuang sighed, but his eyes narrowed slightly.

“There are already many experts gathered around me, but they are not very strong. They don’t have absolute confidence that they can keep me here, so they don’t act rashly. They are waiting for more experts to gather and form a more complete encirclement as if they want to completely cut off my chance to escape.”

Jian Wushuang had already guessed the intentions of the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

“I can’t continue like this. Anyway, I’ve given you a chance. Whether you can take me down next will depend on your own abilities.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but his figure accelerated instantly!
