Chapter 5412 ¬†Useless Zhen Wuyang

Among the three, their strengths were quite indistinct.

Yet, in terms of opportunities, Tongtian Buddha had the upper hand. He had emerged as the most prominent inheritor by winning the top spot on Grave God Mountain.

Having obtained the inheritance of the three main gods of the Qishen Temple on Grave God Mountain, he lacked neither treasures nor secret techniques. This visit could be considered a leisurely outing.

Chishui was not lacking either, being born as a Special Life Form with a divine body stronger than the Special Life Forms nurtured in the God's Tomb.

He possessed a divine body that was already ten thousand times superior from the moment of his appearance. Up until now, what he lacked was treasures and divine body techniques, both of which he found on Grave God Mountain.

His divine body soared all the way, his cultivation progressing smoothly. He even acquired the cosmic secret technique for pursuing the divine body path, and now his strength was formidable. On Grave God Mountain, he had become a prominent figure.

On the other hand, Zhen Wuyang had powerful abilities in various aspects but couldn't break through a certain special aspect.

Overall, he was very powerful, an excellent Inheritor, but if one were to talk about being heaven-defying, he fell short.

He did not stand out in any aspect!

This was the evaluation given to him by Zhen Ling.

While competing with Chishui in divine bodies, although Zhen Wuyang possessed the divine body of True Martial, he only managed to break through to 30,000-fold on Grave God Mountain. Currently, his basic divine body was around 40,000-fold, combined with the divine body's ultimate skill, reaching a maximum of 50,000-fold.

In the Four Great Secret Realms, this could be considered heaven-defying, but on Grave God Mountain, it was merely average.

Chishui's basic divine body had surpassed 50,000-fold.

This was already the level of a peak-level tier 6.

Tongtian Buddha's spatial Origin Source had reached the realm of a black hole, possessing a perfect inheritance. He was no longer pursuing anything else and was now dedicated to creating his own secret techniques, following an advanced path.

He was destined for the summit in the future.

One pursued the divine body, the other followed the orthodox path of the spatial Origin Source.

Zhen Wuyang, however, had no clear goal.

This opportunity was rare and must not be missed; otherwise, he would fall far behind others.

Fortunately, his current strength still matched that of Tongtian and Chishui. If he didn't strive now, he would end up at the bottom in the future.

Also, they embarrassed the cultivators from the Eastern Universe.

Now, the Grave God Mountain was filled with towering peaks.

Fengyu, Chishui, Tongtian, Zhen Wuyang, and others were present.

But currently, they were the strongest among their group.

Even among the younger generation, they didn't fall behind.

Especially Hu Qing from the Tongtian Buddha Realm, consistently ranked among the top in Ultimate Dao Lords, displaying formidable strength.

On the Grave God Mountain, numerous talented individuals from the Grand Yan Immortals had gone there over the years.

Though the number of Ultimate Dao Lords was relatively smaller, it still amounted to over a thousand when accumulated.

They were aware that the future success lay in the hands of these juniors who grasped the ultimate path. They themselves were merely guides and protectors of the Dao. Therefore, they held a high regard for these juniors.

Despite the disparity in the Origin Source, they were unwilling to give up.

The road to the pinnacle in the future was not easy.

Everything was relative; the Ultimate Dao was powerful, but combining Dao could suppress a batch, and reaching the summit was incredibly challenging.

For these non-Ultimate Dao powerhouses, reaching the summit was difficult, but much simpler than mastering the Ultimate Dao.

Out of 10,000 Ultimate Emperors, achieving five peak-level experts was considered good. This was with the guidance of the Qishen Temple and the immense resources and efforts invested.

Moreover, there were not even 10,000 Ultimate Emperors available for Qishen Temple to cultivate.

That's why they relaxed the conditions, allowing Emperors like Zhen Wuyang to enter the Grave God Mountain for future considerations.

Zhen Wuyang, sitting in the main seat of the hall, contemplated for a long time before speaking, "Our opponents are not in the open!"

He couldn't forget Zhen Ling's instructions.

Opportunities highly valued even by Zhen Ling and beyond his control. Entering them could lead to one's demise.

This was no child's play!

On the surface, there was just the Island Lord of Turtle Spirit Island, nothing significant.

The three of them combined could easily suppress him.

"Brother Zhen Wuyang, how about this," Tongtian Buddha suggested, "We spread the news, inform the people on Grave God Mountain, and notify the entire Four Great Secret Realms. No matter how many come, our alliance of three remains unchanged!"

Chishui was somewhat unwilling; in doing so, it would likely attract many strong individuals. If the opportunity was significant, the formidable old experts might descend, and then they would have nothing to do.

Chishui hastily retorted, "Absolutely not! If this news spreads, not only the people on Grave God Mountain but also the Divine Temple and Elder Palace will dispatch powerful individuals. Coupled with those indigenous old monsters, how can I compete with them?"

"No, no, Brother Chishui, you've misunderstood my meaning." Tongtian Buddha paused for a moment, then turned to Zhen Wuyang and said, "Where did this opportunity come from? It was given by Lord Zhen Ling. Regardless of our decision, we must first inform Lord Zhen Ling."

This statement was a gamble on Chishui's part.

All three individuals had avatars on Grave God Mountain. Delaying could lead to unforeseen changes. After some discussion, they decided to seek the guidance of Lord Zhen Ling.

On the other hand, the Turtle Spirit Island Lord, Gui Ling, was also in a bind.

One Zhen Wuyang was already causing him a headache, and now two more Inheritors had arrived, both with formidable strengths.

One had a powerful divine body that couldn't be killed, and the other had an Origin Source connecting to the heavens, surpassing his own realm.

He was truly panicking now. The other strong individuals who had been observing from the outside were all summoned by him.

The several tier 6 Emperors on the West Coast were not highly regarded by Gui Ling.

However, the people in the core sea area, who looked down on the outer sea, not only opposed his invitation but also stood against him. It would be better not to invite them at all.

On the West Coast, in terms of actual strength, the Turtle Spirit Island Lord naturally ranked first. He had been at the peak-level of the tier 6 for many years.

If not for this, the Mo Luo Nation's army wouldn't dare to wage war recklessly on the West Coast. This was all thanks to the blessing of Turtle Spirit Island.

"Gui Ling, this matter is quite simple!"

Turtle Spirit Island Lord followed the voice and saw a young man with a toad-like face.

Of course, he perceived the essence. The person who spoke was undoubtedly an exceptionally handsome young man in white, like jade in the snow.

Looking at what seemed like a person but was, in fact, a toad in a stinking ditch on the West Coast.

No wonder the inhabitants of the Inner Sea looked down on those from the West Coast. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

They didn't even want to admit their true nature, each considering themselves part of the human race.

But now, as everyone sat together, with no distinction between high and low, the Turtle Spirit Island Lord raised his hand and spoke, "Brother Tianchan, please continue!"

"Brother Gui Ling, how do we activate this remnant you mentioned?" Tianchan arched his hand.

The Turtle Spirit Island Lord felt a bit awkward; this point was well-raised. The treasure needed to open the remnant had not been obtained yet.

It was the 'Bloodfall Crystal' that Gong Miaoyi was supposed to inherit.

Tianchan and the others had gathered enough information; they knew who had taken it and had dispatched people to search everywhere.

"I think, for now, our key is to find the Bloodfall Crystal. Don't worry about the Inheritors. Once we have the method to open it, we can enter directly. Without laying a hand on them, we won't offend anyone, and the people from the temple won't have grounds to deal with us!" After dealing with the Divine Temple for so many years, they had learned the Divine Temple's ways.
