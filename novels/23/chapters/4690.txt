4691 Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes

Perhaps he had guessed Jian Wushuang’s intention. The Young Emperor smiled secretly and said, “But I’m happy today, so I’ll spare you from the death penalty. However, you can’t escape punishment.”

“I’ll punish the two of you to go to the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes and help me get rid of some trouble. How about it?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him but did not speak.

“If you get rid of those troubles, not only will I spare you from death, but I will also give you freedom. At that time, I will personally remove these chains for you.”

Chun Qiu was stunned on the spot. The temptation of being able to redeem his freedom was too great!

He had been a prisoner for who knew how many eras. Even the galaxies in the sky had been lit up and extinguished several times. The days of extracting ores from the black mountains day after day had made him extremely painful. He had also thought of destroying his life source, but the shackles on his neck made him unable to even commit suicide!

However, now, when hope appeared, Chun Qiu was not willing to give up. He looked at Jian Wushuang almost madly.

Time passed slowly, and the Young Emperor seemed not to be in a hurry to receive a reply. He half-leaned on the bed and closed his eyes to rest.

After a long while, Jian Wushuang’s voice was heard. “Okay, I agree.”

“Wise choice.” The Young Emperor opened his eyes quietly and said playfully, “Then, let’s set off immediately.”

The sky of the Lower Three Heavens was never illuminated by the sun, just like the end of time that the prisoners could not see.

When the sealed boundary appeared in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the dozens of figures stopped in the void.

The Young Emperor, who was wearing a snow-white cloak, stood side by side with Jian Wushuang and threw him something.

“This Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror is used for communication between you and me. Every trouble that you help me eradicate, I will know about it through this mirror.”

“Remember what I said. I want the entire Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes to be cleaned out.”

After keeping the mirror, Jian Wushuang looked at him and said, “You better remember your promise.”

With that, Jian Wushuang did not stay any longer. He stepped into the boundary with Chun Qiu. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In the dark sky, the Young Emperor smiled playfully.

“Your Highness, why did you let him enter the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes? Even I don’t want to fight in there. If he goes in, I’m afraid there’s a 90 percent chance of him dying.” The skinny purple-robed man who had been standing behind him finally spoke.

The Young Emperor said, “To me, he’s a variable. I won’t allow any variables to appear. This is just a test. If he doesn’t pass, he’ll naturally die in the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes and save me some trouble. If he passes, it’ll be the best thing for me.”

“My partner, you must find out who captured him later,” the Young Emperor narrowed his eyes and said. “if he’s an Emperor, I can’t let him live.”

The purple-robed figure nodded, and then the dozens of figures all disappeared.

…

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who was shuttling back and forth in the dark boundary, looked into the distance and observed everything.

From his conversation with Chun Qiu, Jian Wushuang knew that this Mysterious Realm was just a drop in the ocean of the Great Yan Domain.

The entire Realm was formed by the Six Heavens. The Lower Three Heavens were where the prisoners gathered and were in charge of mining the purple crystals in the black mountains. The remaining Three Heavens were called Little Lonely Heaven, Big Lonely Heaven, and Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, which we’re about to enter.

The one who controlled the entire Six Heavens Realm was the strange and mysterious Young Emperor who had a feminine appearance.

This entire Six Heavens Realm was also the territory that his Imperial Father had given him.

Jian Wushuang was naturally not interested in these things. What he needed to do most at the moment was to enter the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes and kill all the troubles in order to gain freedom.

The dark barrier was not very long. After flying at full speed for more than half a day, Jian Wushuang stepped into it.

As far as the eye could see, the red sand was the main color of the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyeseyes.

The wind whistled, rolling up a huge amount of red sand.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and created a barrier to block the sandstorm.

Although there was an abundance of Yan power in the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, there were too many impurities in it. It was obviously not suitable for absorption, which increased the difficulty.

With a bloody nose and a swollen face, Chun Qiu followed closely behind Jian Wushuang, afraid that he would encounter a great danger if he walked any slower.

Then, Chun Qiu called out to him and took out a dozen more treasures.

Jian Wushuang could clearly see that these were the supreme treasures that belonged to the Yan Immortal, who was at the Black Mountains.

“Didn’t the Young Emperor take all of these?”

Chun Qiu grinned. “He only took seven or eight. The remaining ten or so are naturally with me. You can choose a few to defend yourself. It’s better than nothing.”

Jian Wushuang did not refuse. He directly chose an exquisite Emerald Jade Guord, an Octagonal Talisman, and half a Black Copper Mask.

After keeping the Emerald Jade Guord and the Black Copper Mask, he immediately used the Octagonal Talisman.

He dipped a drop of divine blood into the center of the talisman and threw it into the air. The Octagonal Talisman immediately transformed into a figure that was exactly the same as Jian Wushuang.

Although the puppet only had 60 percent of his power, Jian Wushuang was still satisfied with the effect of the Octagonal Talisman.

After all, having an extra helper in the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes would greatly increase his chances of survival.

Judging from the Young Emperor’s behavior, the situation in the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes was not optimistic. The so-called ‘trouble’ would probably be far beyond Jian Wushuang’s expectations.

He walked forward slowly. The boundless red sand wilderness was deathly silent, and there was not even the slightest breath of life.

“Be careful. It seems like no one has ever set foot in this Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes. I wonder what kind of trouble is waiting for us,” Chun Qiu said nervously.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything, but the Invisible Sword had already appeared in his hand.

In the next moment, a few gusts of sand suddenly shot out from the depths of the earth’s core.

Like a dragon’s roar, the violent sand that almost touched the sky surged and crushed over.

The blade-like astral wind raged.

Jian Wushuang raised his Invisible Sword and released a vast Sword Intent.

The unimaginable Sword Intent instantly turned into a long river of Sword Dao. Each Sword Intent was like a magnificent wave!

Who would dare to resist the Sword Intent of a Yan Immortal realm cultivator?

The long river of Sword Dao swept through the world, directly crushing the six giant red sand pillars into powder. Then, without losing its momentum, it surged between the heaven and earth, almost covering the sky.

“What an arrogant brat. How dare you tear off a few strands of my beard? What sort of punishment should I dish out to you?”

The mighty voice resounded like a great bell between heaven and earth, and the entire desolte land of red sand began to become restless.

An unimaginably huge face slowly condensed as the sand and stones fell.
