Chapter 2979: Second Level True Saint

——

“I thought this mission was not challenging at all, but now it seems that I’m lucky enough to meet you, which makes this mission a little more interesting.” Prince Qian Chen grinned, his figure suddenly swayed.

Whoosh! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even Jian Wushuang could only see a flash of black light.

“So fast!”

“He’s even faster than before.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. At the same time, he found that His Highness Qian Chen had already appeared beside him, and a beautiful saber light lit up.

The saber light was gorgeous and colorful, leaving a vast saber river in the void.

The saber river was boundless, but it was exuding a terrifying power.

“This saber…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

He could clearly sense that the power of this saber was much stronger than the many saber lights that Prince Qian Chen had displayed before.

This saber had completely exceeded the scope of a first-rank True Saint.

“Humph!”

With a cold snort, Jian Wushuang immediately made his move.

Boundless divine power surged out from his body, and endless sword essence gathered in the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

As he swung his sword, a large number of space-time blades with sword shadows immediately emerged clearly, forming a huge blade storm in the blink of an eye!

It was the ninth move of space-time swordsmanship, Storm!

It was also the strongest sword move that Jian Wushuang had created so far. In the past 80 years, as Jian Wushuang’s understanding of space-time rules and sword principle improved, the power of the first move of Storm also greatly increased.

The greatsword Storm had completely covered the void in front of him.

However, the brilliant blade river directly swept past, and the sword Storm directly collapsed from the center.

Jian Wushuang’s sword move also collapsed instantly.

“In terms of absolute arts, the storm move that I created is ultimately too low-level.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly.

After the brilliant blade river destroyed the sword Storm, it continued to attack him, forcing him to continuously retreat. It took him a long time to stop.

However, after he stopped, he waved his hand. “Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!~ ~ ~”

Streaks of cyan streamers rushed out. These cyan streamers shuttled through the void rapidly and then floated in front of Jian Wushuang.

These gray streamers were cyan longswords. They were Star Luo Swords.

There were a total of 18 Star Luo Swords. Each of them emitted the aura of a third-grade superior holy treasure.

“Condense!”

As Jian Wushuang uttered the word, the 18 Star Luo Swords immediately condensed together at the fastest speed.

In an instant…rumble ~ ~ ~

An earth-shaking rumble sounded, and a huge spiral tunnel that emitted the power of endless reincarnation rules appeared between heaven and earth.

This spiral tunnel was like the reincarnation tunnel that led to reincarnation, mysterious, vast, and unfathomable!

However, in the reincarnation tunnel, a brilliant green light was faintly discernible.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold, and the faintly discernible green light in the reincarnation tunnel suddenly shot out.

The green light was extremely long and carried a huge green tail. It was dozens of meters long, but it was not large in size, but it was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it had already appeared in front of Prince Qian Chen.

Fifth level of the reincarnation sword formation, saint beheading!

Prince Qian Chen’s expression became a little grave as he seemed to have seen the extraordinary nature of this sword formation. Immediately, he swung the battle blade in his hand.

With this swing, endless darkness was directly covered over.

Clang!

A low and deep sound of metal colliding sounded. The reincarnation sword formation formed by the eighteen Star Luo Swords paused for a moment before it was immediately sent flying backwards.

However, Prince Qian Chen’s body suddenly sank. His right arm, which was holding the saber, sank and he took three steps back.

“This sword formation is so powerful!” Prince Qian Chen was shocked.

“Again.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. Under the control of his will, the Samsara Sword Formation, which had been sent flying, once again turned into a cyan-colored flowing light and shot out.

Boom! Boom!

The cyan light and the huge cyan tail appeared in front of His Highness Qian Chen again.

“Haha, Good Timing. This is interesting.”

His Highness Qian Chen was not surprised. His divine power surged, and his aura immediately rose. Then he charged out with his saber and fought head-on with the reincarnation sword formation. At the same time, His Highness Qian Chen collided with the reincarnation sword formation.

Jian Wushuang tightened his grip on the Blood Mountain Sword, and a supreme sword essence suddenly rose.

This sword essence was supreme, like the ruler of sword principle, dominating the world.

With the help of the sword essence, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength instantly soared to a new level. He glanced at Prince Qian Chen with a bright light in his eyes.

“Kill!”

With a low shout, Jian Wushuang dashed out in an instant.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Numerous cold and sharp sword lights were directly displayed in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

He had already used many secret skills, and now he had guided the sword essence. His battle strength and essence realm had reached their peak. Each of the sword lights displayed was ridiculously strong and astonishingly fast, the densely packed sword lights crazily attacked Prince Qian Chen.

Although Prince Qian Chen’s strength was shocking, he did not dare to ignore Jian Wushuang’s sword lights. He had to spare a lot of energy to resist them. However, under Jian Wushuang’s control, the reincarnation sword formation also attacked him time and time again.

The reincarnation sword formation contained terrifying power, and even he did not dare to underestimate it.

Prince Qian Chen was embarrassed.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Clang!

Only to see a continuous sound from the battlefield from the middle of the transmission, Barbarian King Team of people, but have been staring blankly.

“Isn’t that, isn’t that a little too strong?”

“He’s too strong. The black-robed youth who used the saber has terrifying saber techniques and his comprehension of the laws of darkness has reached an unbelievable level. Although he’s only a Peak False Saint, his battle strength has definitely surpassed that of a first rank True Saint. Yes, he definitely has the battle strength of a second rank True Saint!”

“A Peak False Saint has battle strength comparable to a rank two True Saint? Where did this monster come from?”

The members of the Barbarian King Team could not help exclaiming in surprise.

However, if the strength displayed by Prince Qian Chen only shocked them, then it would be completely unbelievable.

However, Jian Wushuang, who fought with Prince Qian Chen in a head-on battle and even had a slight advantage, was completely incredible.

After all, Jian Wushuang…was only a Divine Master!

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, he, he…”

“I think I’m dreaming. It’s impossible!”

“It’s impossible. I’ve never seen a Divine Master who could fight with a rank two True Saint. Unless he hid his aura!”

…
