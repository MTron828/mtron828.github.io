Chapter 3066: Swordsmanship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

Jiu Luo was straightforward and straightforward. He did not think too much about it.

He did think Bai Xiao’s swordsmanship was powerful, but at the same time, he also mentioned Jian Wushuang.

“The Heavenly Marquis Brothers?”

Bai Xiao’s eyes slightly moved. “Junior Brother Jiu Luo, who are the Heavenly Marquis Brothers you mentioned just now?”

“This?” Jiu Luo was startled. He immediately realized that he had said the wrong thing, he immediately said, “Senior Martial Brother Bai Xiao, don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying that your sword techniques are inferior to the Heavenly Marquis Brothers. I just think that the sword techniques of the two of you are very impressive!”

“Now that you mention it, I’m even more curious.” Bai Xiao laughed, “Even in the Dao Palace that is filled with monsters, there are only a handful of first-level True Saints who are comparable to me in terms of Sword Dao and sword techniques. The meaning behind your words just now is clear that your Heavenly Marquis Brothers can be compared to me in terms of sword techniques. In fact, they might even be stronger than me...”

Jiu Luo frowned. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Deacon Wan smiled and said, “Bai Xiao, your Junior Brother Jiu Luo has just come from the endless territory, so his vision is inevitably limited. You don’t have to take it seriously. As for his Heavenly Marquis Brother, I know that I’m the little guy next to me, but he also just came from the endless territory.”

“Oh?” Jiu Luo’s eyes moved slightly, and then he looked directly at Jian Wushuang.

Many disciples of the Young Divine Sect also looked at Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang, he touched his nose with a strange expression.

He did not feel anything when Jiu Luo fought with Bai Xiao, but when Jiu Luo lost and said that, Jian Wushuang knew it was going to be bad.

He knew very well that a top genius like Bai Xiao had his own pride. Even in the Dao Palace, which was full of geniuses, his pride would not be weakened, even if there were more talented people in the Dao Palace, he would also dare to compete with stronger geniuses.

But now, Jiu Luo’s words clearly meant that Bai Xiao’s swordsmanship might not be as good as his. Even if Jiu Luo just said it casually, it would still attract Bai Xiao’s attention. As expected, now Bai Xiao came to find him.

“Are you the Heavenly Marquis Brother that Junior Brother Jiu Luo mentioned?” Bai Xiao stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Is your swordsmanship very powerful?” Bai Xiao asked.

“It’s just so-so,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Just so-so? That can’t be right.” Bai Xiao smiled. “Junior Brother Jiuluo’s talent is not bad. Since he just said that, he must have seen your swordsmanship and knows that your swordsmanship is extraordinary. This makes me curious. How about we have a head-on swordsmanship competition here?”

“A swordsmanship competition?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The surrounding disciples of the Young Divine Sect immediately burst into an uproar.

“Did you hear that? Senior Brother Baixiao wants to compete with this person in swordsmanship?”

“Weren’t we the ones who went to ask for Senior Brother Baixiao’s advice before? Why is Senior Brother Bai Xiao taking the initiative to compete with him now?”

“It’s all because of Junior Brother Jiu Luo’s words just now. His words clearly mean that Senior Brother Bai Xiao’s swordsmanship is not as good as his Heavenly Marquis Brother. If I were senior brother Bai Xiao, I would definitely be unconvinced in my heart. I would definitely find this person and compete with him.”

The sound of private discussions also resounded throughout the martial arts practice field.

There were three figures standing quietly beside the crowd.

Like Bai Xiao, these three people were top geniuses from the Dao Palace.

When they heard Bai Xiao mention the competition to Jian Wushuang, the three people looked at each other and smiled.

“Bai Xiao, your junior brother just said it unintentionally. You don’t have to be so serious, right?” The red-haired man with his arms crossed said with a smile.

“That’s right. This senior brother of yours just came from endless territories and has seen some geniuses before. He just randomly met someone whose swordsmanship is more outstanding and felt that he was very powerful. This is very normal. There’s no need for you to be so calculative,” a black-robed young man said.

“In my opinion, it’s better to forget about it,” the beautiful woman in golden armor said at the end.

The three of them seemed to be trying to persuade Bai Xiao, but in fact, they were all gloating.

Bai Xiao was arrogant, and like Bai Xiao, they were all from the Dao Palace. Of course, there were also arrogant people. They were not happy with what Jiu Luo had said.

After all, they were the top geniuses selected by the Divine Ancestor Dao Palace. They stood at the top of the entire Divine Beginning World. How could any one of them be comparable to them?

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Jiu Luo looked at Jian Wushuang apologetically.

He had said it casually and unintentionally, but he did not expect it to bring so much trouble to Jian Wushuang.

“This battle is inevitable.” Bai Xiao’s eyes sparkled as he stared at Jian Wushuang. “How about it? Do you dare to compete?”

Jian Wushuang shrugged and said casually, “Since you want to compete, fine, I’ll grant you your wish.”

“Very good. Here, you and I will only use the divine power of an ordinary rank one True Saint to compete in swordsmanship. I’ll let you fight first.” Bai Xiao smiled with absolute confidence.

“Let me fight first? Are you sure?” Jian Wushuang looked at Bai Xiao with interest.

“Of course.” Bai Xiao nodded, but he did not take Jian Wushuang seriously.

“In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony.”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“In the Bodhi World, I created a complete peerless sword manual with seven sword techniques. Except for the Xi Xiang, Star Dream, and the ninth firmament illusionary sword realm, I haven’t experienced any real combat with these seven sword techniques. Now...I’ll use this Bai Xiao to test my sword techniques!”

Jian Wushuang tightened his grip on the Blood Mountain Sword, a faint smile on his face. Then, under the watchful eyes of the surrounding disciples, he moved.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

One after another, strange figures suddenly burst out.

At this moment, hundreds and thousands of ‘Jian Wushuang’ appeared in the world.

“Space-time illusionary body? Such a crude method is still being used?” Bai Xiao laughed disdainfully.

Space-time Phantoms was a technique that could be used after comprehending the first stage of the space-time principles. Most Divine Masters who had comprehended the space-time principles could easily use hundreds or thousands of phantoms, compared to True Saints, it was indeed a very crude technique.

However, Jian Wushuang did not say anything. After the phantoms burst out at the same time, he suddenly took a step forward, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand fell straight down.

Bai Xiao, the three genius disciples from the Dao Palace, and many disciples from the Young Divine Sect only saw a flash of sword shadow.
