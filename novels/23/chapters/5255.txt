Chapter 5254: One of the Emperors, Pm the Fastest

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Except for that Dao Lord Xue Yue and Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing who erupted with full power, he wasn’t entirely sure about the others, but it was highly likely that none of them could match his speed.

Now, with the Candle Dragon Feathers, his speed would undoubtedly crush those of the same level. He surpassed even the half-step Emperor and was faster than those extraordinary Grand Yan Immortals.

He truly reached the pinnacle, becoming the best under the Emperor.

Jian Wushuang carefully contemplated this, completely immersing himself in the process.

When he displayed the Beast God Domain again, his brows furrowed.

“It’s over!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

His speed was as perfect as he had imagined, incredibly suited to him. But what he desired most was the fusion with the Candle Dragon Eye. Although he didn’t dare hope for a complete Beast God Weapon, as long as the two fused, the power of this ancient treasure could rival those imitated Eternal Treasures.

However, they couldn’t coexist now, greatly diminishing its value.

Fortunately, when combined with the Beast God Domain, his speed increased significantly, compensating for some of his losses.

If someone else had exchanged for it, wouldn’t they be infuriated?

He spent so many treasure points, only gaining a speed boost.

The old man with the horns sensed Jian Wushuangs confusion and slowly spoke, “Little guy, do you feel that the two can’t completely merge?”

The old man with the horns, who had long seen through everything, sat up straight!

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and nodded respectfully.

“That’s correct,” the old man with horns said, holding the small hammer in his hand. “Ever since the Beast God Weapon was damaged, although it retains a lot of power, the cost to restore it is incredibly high.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. The master had spoken; it seemed the integration required an extraordinary price.

“Master, 1 don’t know how to integrate it!”

Since he had obtained this ancient treasure and its power was so immense, he, as a Grand Yan Immortal, could activate it. Even after advancing to the rank of Emperor, it would greatly assist him. Especially now, with the opportunity to merge the two powers, fusion could rival the replicated Eternal Treasures. Its usefulness would extend even into tier 5 of Emperors. This was a treasure capable of enhancing his divine body.

Incredible value!

Inside the Original Universe, the most extraordinary beings possessed bodies with 10,000-fold power. Now, with the Beast God’s Eye, he could barely reach 8,000-fold. If the two merged, breaking the 10,000-fold barrier wouldn’t be impossible, especially after enhancing his basic divine body.

The divine body and the origin source.

These were the two paths for cultivators. The former affected combat strength, while the latter influenced realms. One couldn’t lack either. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Currently, his origin source Dao was sufficiently strong. Even if his sword technique couldn’t break through in a short time, he could match a half-step Emperor. Furthermore, his soul realm improved rapidly. Breaking the Perfected Nine Revolutions wasn’t impossible. By then, he could advance further.

What he needed now was a powerful divine body. He wasn’t entirely confident about countering the Devouring Demons’ future attacks on his own.

The old man with horns, observing Jian Wushuangs serious expression, held great respect for him and offered a few words of guidance.

“Wanting to merge isn’t very difficult, it’s just a matter of how much you’re willing to invest.”

Jian Wushuangs gaze was firm. This opportunity was not to be missed. The fusion of the Beast God Weapons was probably something only the experts in the Qishen Temple could achieve. If he ventured out without completing this, he might as well be blindfolded, groping in the dark.

“No matter the cost, I’m willing to do it!” Jian Wushuang said with a determined expression.

The elderly man with goat-like horns nodded gently and continued, “To merge, you must get one of the top Divine Craftsmen in the universe. 1 can arrange that much. The rest is relatively simple. You’ll need five different heaven-earth origin sources. Four of them are available in the Treasure Hall, and you can exchange them there.”

“They are the gold crystal origin source, wood crystal origin source, fire crystal origin source, and earth crystal origin source.”

Jian Wushuang noted each one down. He had some recollection of these four major heaven-earth origin sources; he had scanned through them before.

Their prices were around 100,000 treasure points each.

Currently, he had 1.3 million treasure points. After deducting the 800,000 for the Dragon Candle Wings, he had exactly 500,000 left, which was just enough.

As for the spatial origin source, he could exchange it later after receiving more points from the following waves. Even if someone else exchanged it in the meantime, it wouldn’t matter. With the Candle Dragon Wings, his comprehension speed of the spatial origin source was very fast, although it might not show significant improvements right away. But the key was persistence.

As for the treasure points, they were external possessions. As long as they could enhance his combat power, they were worth it.

Jian Wushuang didn’t mind this at all.

In the subsequent three waves, there were over ten million treasure points. He could secure at least half of them. Although it would get increasingly difficult for him as the waves progressed, he was confident he could secure half, especially with the Candle Dragon Wings. His speed would be even faster, allowing him to move freely among the Devouring Demons’ forces.

The origins of the four great worlds amounted to 400,000 treasure points.

“Thank you, Senior!” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

Then, with a hint of confusion, he asked, “Senior, I don’t know where to exchange the remaining source of origin!’

“The remaining one!” The old man with horns smiled faintly. Everything he could do was within certain limits. He knew where the remaining portion was, but he couldn’t tell Jian Wushuang.

The first four portions were in the Treasure Hall and were public. If he said it, he said it. But the remaining portion was not public; he couldn’t reveal it.

“Little fellow, 1 can’t tell you where the remaining portion is!” The old man with horns shook his head. Jian Wushuang’s expression froze!

He couldn’t be told?

What did that mean?

Why say so much in the beginning if he couldn’t be told?

Was he being teased?

Or was there some hidden truth?

Jian Wushuang speculated in his heart. He was like an ant on a hot pot right now, very anxious.

Every time, he fell just short, and it was truly frustrating!

A thought flashed through Jian Wushuangs mind. He asked tactfully, “Senior,

I wonder if there is still hope for me to obtain this last origin source?”

This question was very subtle. Even if Qishen Temple had some control over the old man with horns, they wouldn’t interfere with this, right?

The old man with horns also revealed a faint smile, an expression of teaching a child. He nodded to Jian Wushuang and said with a slight smile, “I can tell you this. There is still a chance, especially in the eleventh wave. Your hope is quite significant! ”

The old man with horns was quite happy. He had narrowed down the scope quite a bit, which made Jian Wushuang very happy.

“By the way, the name of this last origin source is similar to the names of other heaven-earth origin sources,” the old man with horns continued. Jian Wushuangs pupils contracted, surprised. “water crystal origin source?”

“Thank you for resolving my doubts, Senior. 1 will remember your guidance deeply!” Jian Wushuang bowed deeply.

This time, it came from the bottom of his heart.

On the path of cultivation, he remembered everyone who helped him.

Xuan Yi!

Jian Wushuang bowed, thinking of his mentor who had helped him immensely. His eyes flickered with a hint of sadness, muttering to himself.

“Master Xuan Yi, will we meet again?”

“Since we parted, I have grown a lot!”
