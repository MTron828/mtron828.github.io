Chapter 2652: Life Liquid

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Star Picking Pavilion was the first-ranked Chamber of Commerce in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

They had more than one branch in the Danyang Holy Domain and had a sub-pavilion of course within the Wushui Territory.

Jian Wushuang concealed his aura before slowly walking toward the Star Picking Pavilion.

If he deliberately concealed his divine power breath as a Perfect Chaotic Creature, no one would be able to detect his real abilities.

A Black Chief greeted him immediately as soon as he entered the Star Picking Pavilion.

“What do you need?” The Black Chief’s attitude was rather humble as he must have noticed Jian Wushuang’s strength.

“I want to sell something,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Your Excellency, please come with me.” The Black Chief brought Jian Wushuang to a secret room covered by a restriction shield.

The Black Chief asked, “What do you want to sell?”

“I’m afraid you can’t make a decision regarding the items I’m going to sell,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Black Chief was not annoyed at all and smiled instead. “If that’s the case, please wait a moment while I get the Golden Chief.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

It did not take long for a Golden Chief to appear in front of Jian Wushuang after the Black Chief’s departure.

The Golden Chief was a graceful and beautiful woman.

The beautiful woman gently asked, “My name is Qian Qin and I’m the Golden Chief. Your Excellency, how shall I address you?”

Jian Wushuang replied, “Su Han.”

“What treasures do you wish to sell, Master Su Han?” Qian Qin humbly asked.

“I want to sell two items. The first is this.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out a green jade bottle which exuded a strong breath of life with a drop of green liquid in it.

It was Life Liquid.

“This is...” As soon as the beautiful woman called Qian Qin saw the green liquid drop, she narrowed her eyes. “Is this Life Liquid?”

“Life Liquid?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He got the green liquid from killing a Golden Chief of the Star Picking Pavilion—Yuan Lei in the Narcissus Territory previously.

Jian Wushuang had only noticed the treasure was extraordinary but did not know the treasure’s name or how valuable it was.

He was still unaware the green liquid drop was called the Life Liquid until that moment.

“Life Liquid contains majestic vitality which can restore a person’s vitality in a short time if a seriously injured or dying cultivator consumes it. It’s also used as an ingredient for elixir pill refinement in many life-saving elixir pills.”

“In addition, this Life Liquid is also of great use to cultivators who understand the Vitality Law. One will be able to work seamlessly with the Vitality Law if they drink this. It also contains Vitality Law essence, hence can also be used purely as a meditative treasure.”

“It’s indeed a very rare and precious treasure in short. I’ll purchase it for three hundred million Primordial Stones if Master Su Han is willing to sell this to the Star Picking Pavilion,” said Qian Qin.

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He knew that Life Liquid was extraordinary, but had not expected it to be so valuable.

300,000,000 Primordial Stones... The Heavenly Treasure Offensive Divine Soul Weapon was only sold for 100,000,000 million Primordial Stones.

“This Golden Chief knows quite a fair bit. I wonder how Yuan Lei got the Life Liquid.” Jian Wushuang groaned but immediately spoke, “I don’t need Primordial Stones. I only need the Divine Elixir Pill. I wonder how many Divine Elixir Pills can the Life Liquid be exchanged for?”

“Exchange for Divine Elixir Pills?” Qian Qin furrowed her brows slightly and she replied after a long time, “Master Su Han, this Life Liquid is very valuable, hence if you can indeed change for Divine Elixir Pill if you wish. However, unlike the Primordial Stone Divine Elixir Pills are hard to get. I don’t have many in the sub-pavilion, so I can only replace a portion with Divine Elixir Pills using a higher Primordial Stones exchange ratio.”

“How much can I get?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This Life Liquid is worth 300 million Primordial Stones, but if you want to get some Divine Elixir Pills, I can give you 20 Divine Elixir Pills in addition to a hundred million Primordial Stones,” said Qian Qin.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The market price for a Divine Elixir Pill was 5,000,000 Primordial Stones, but that was the exchange price for Divine Elixir Pills to Primordial Stones.

It was not as simple for the other way round which was to exchange Primordial Stones for Divine Elixir Pills.

The Life Liquid valued at 300,000,000 Primordial Stones could only be exchanged for 20 Divine Elixir Pills and 100,000,000 Primordial Stones. That 20 Divine Elixir Pills was equivalent to 200,000,000 Primordial Stones with the ratio used being 10,000,000 Primordial Stones to one Divine Elixir Pill.

“I wonder if Master Su Han is willing to proceed with the exchange?” Qian Qin smiled and peered at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, I am.” Jian Wushuang did not hesitate.

Primordial Stones were of no use to him and he needed the Divine Elixir Pill!

Although 20 Divine Elixir Pill was not much, it was enough to increase his divine power by several folds.

“I have another treasure here which should be more precious than the Life Liquid.” Jian Wushuang smiled before flipping his hand and taking out an item.

It was a thumb-sized scarlet Blood Gem.

The scarlet Blood Gem seems ordinary at first glance.

However, the Golden Chief was so observant that she could recognize the extraordinary Blood Gem at a glance.

“It’s a Royal Blood Gem!”

Qian Qin had always maintained a dainty and graceful posture, but her face instantly changed after seeing the Royal Blood Gem!

She was shocked by the treasure Jian Wushuang took out.

“Is it really the Royal Blood Gem?” Qian Qin stared at the treasure while her insides were perturbing.

Royal Blood Gems were the main material used to refine Holy Treasures!

It was invaluable not only to Ultimate Gods but even some haughty Undying Saints. Undying Saints who wanted to refine a piece of Holy Treasure often paid a great price in search of Royal Blood Gems.

Such a precious and rare refinement material had unexpectedly appeared in front of Qian Qin!

“Master Su Han.”

Qian Qin looked at Jian Wushuang again with a completely different gaze than before. “You should know the function of this Royal Blood Gem. It’s an extremely rare treasure. Do you really want to sell ​​it to the Star Picking Pavilion?”

Qian Qin was doubtful.

That was a Royal Blood Gem after all!

Even though it was only thumb-sized, its weight must be at least ten catties which was still worth a frightening sum.

The most important issue was not its high value, but the difficulty in finding it as one could only stumble upon it by luck.
