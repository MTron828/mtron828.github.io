This was also the most welcome news for Jian Wushuang.

How much is left in the treasury? Xuanyuan Dapan asked after taking the ledger.

About a billion, enough to sustain the family for several years!

Swish!eastern fantasy

Xuanyuan Dapan took out his own ledger.

l have several billion here; lets add it to the family treasury!

The operation of a large family requires godstones in the range of billions; having a billion is too restrictive.

As the eldest son, Xuanyuan Ancheng had been managing the entire family.

His father, a tier 5 Emperor, couldnt bother with trivial matters.

Father, you! Xuanyuan Ancheng was somewhat moved to see his father taking out his personal wealth.

Bearing the burden of the entire family alone was too exhausting. He wanted to share the load but could only handle some internal matters.

Xuanyuan Dapan showed a faint smile and comforted him, My treasures are sufficient. This time, Ill mainly get some decent treasures for the second and third sons and prepare some auxiliary treasures for the fourth son.

Indeed, his treasures were eternal treasures, not commonly found in auction houses, and their prices were frighteningly high. He acquired them from the Kui Organization.

The conversation quickly came to an end. Jian Wushuang, transformed into a strand of hair, gently adhered to the elder Xuanyuan Ancheng with the breeze.

A fourth-tier Emperor with several billion godstones was undoubtedly tempting for Jian Wushuang.

After the crowd dispersed, Xuanyuan Anshui indeed went to Xuanyuan

Dapans room.

Knock! Knock!!

Jian Wushuang lightly knocked on the door, and a gentle voice from inside said, Come in!

Walking into the room, Xuanyuan Dapan sat in the main seat of the guest hall, sipping tea alone. Next to him, he had prepared a cup for Jian Wushuang.

Grandfather! Xia Mang Guanyu greeted affectionately.

Then, naturally, she sat down beside him.

Yuer, did you enjoy your time at the Firefox Palace that day? Xuanyuan Dapan went straight to the point.

Jian Wushuang could only play dumb. Yes, it was good. I won a lot at the Beastfight arena that day and spent quite a bit of godstones while playing with Jingxuan and the others.

Hmph, you rascal! Xuanyuan Dapan revealed a hint of a smile. Since the younger generation was unwilling to share, he knew the etiquette was not to pry.

However, there were still a few reminders that had to be given, and Jian Wushuang absorbed them all.

Xuanyuan Dapan looked at Jian Wushuang with great satisfaction. He had always felt that his grandsons didnt resemble him, but instead, it was this grandson who displayed his youthful vigor.

Moreover, Xia Mang Guanyu was good at concealing things, and this time he thoroughly understood his grandson.

Although the two seemed to be silent, they actually exchanged quite a bit of useful information.

At least now, they both knew that they were members of the Kui Organization.

Towards the end of their conversation, Xuanyuan Dapan said, Little guy, remember, you have people behind you. Dont put too much pressure on yourself for certain things; thats an abyss that cant be filled!

This statement was clearly a reminder to Jian Wushuang not to fall into the Kui Organizations trap. As a Prince of Great Xia, he wouldnt lack resources, and there was no need to take unnecessary risks.

Jian Wushuang, upon reaching this point in the conversation, immediately stood up and approached Xuanyuan Dapan. He performed a grand salute and respectfully said, Grandson pays respects to Grandfather, recalling Grandfathers words!

You child, were all family here, get up quickly! Xuanyuan Dapan revealed a smile and spoke gently.

However, Jian Wushuang remained kneeling and whispered, Grandfather, please help your grandson. If you dont help, your grandson wont get up!

Upon hearing this, Xuanyuan Dapans expression changed, thinking that Jian Wushuang needed his assistance in some strategic plan. He became more serious and said, Speak, let me hear it!

l need to borrow money! Jian Wushuang knelt on the ground, head buried between his knees.

Xuanyuan Dapan burst into laughter and said, l thought it was something serious, and its just for some godstones?

Yes! Jian Wushuang was straightforward, revealing the whole story.

Are you really going to the battlefield?

This time, Xuanyuan Dapan showed a surprised expression.

Grandfather, if I dont go to the battlefield, I wont be able to accumulate military merits. My second brother will go, and even the Crown Prince will go. If they all go, I certainly wont stay in the imperial city! Jian Wushuang spoke sincerely.

Upon hearing this, Xuanyuan Dapan chuckled and said, Good! Based on your words, I will definitely support you!

Xia Mang Guanyu is a Prince. In the future, he will help the Xuanyuan family. However, at the moment, he has joined the Kuf organization, and his status is not ordinary.

Perhaps he can even attain a prominent position. The future is full of possibilities, and investing a bit of money now is practically nothing. Tell me, how much do you need? Xuanyuan Dapans voice was resolute.

For a Dao Lord, how many godstones could he possibly need?Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

Niillions meant little to him, a tier 5 Emperor. However, when Xia Mang Guanyu spoke, he was taken aback.

100 million! Jian Wushuang exclaimed, then knelt again.

Xuanyuan Dapan felt a bit embarrassed. 100 million wasnt much to him, but with a prominent family behind him, he had to be frugal. Many tier 4

Emperors couldnt produce such a sum.

This kid was audacious.

As the head of a family, he had learned to refuse or mitigate requests.

Adjusting his posture, he said, Yuer, remember, external aids can only help so much. Ultimately, it depends on oneself!

Grandfather, I want a treasure to break through my divine body. My current divine body is too weak. Before becoming an Emperor, I want to surpass a 10,000-fold divine body. Xia Mang Guanyus divine body, like his, was 8,000-fold. Reaching 10,000 was simple, but breaking through required treasures worth over 100 million godstones.

Xuanyuan Dapan continued, Your physical body still needs improvement. Dont chase the power of the divine body too eagerly, lest it puts too much pressure on your physical form.

Grandfather, look! Xia Mang Guanyu waved his hand, and his body self-destructed, then rapidly regenerated.

This represented the limit of a top-tier physical body.

Xuanyuan Dapan didnt expect his grandson to achieve a perfected physical body unconsciously, and it was of top quality. He felt a hint of emotion; perhaps this grandson could ascend to a high position in the future.

However, 100 million was a hefty sum. Despite his reluctance, he eventually agreed.

Jian Wushuang took the mustard seed, his heart stirred.

Today, when he visited the Xuanyuan family, he first borrowed from several cousins, ranging from tens of thousands to a hundred thousand. Even his eldest uncle, who was the stingiest, gave two million after much persuasion. The other uncles were more generous, giving five million.

He knew the real fortune lay with Xuanyuan Dapan.

Mostly, it was because he revealed the purpose of this campaign and some crucial reasons that impressed Xuanyuan Dapan, prompting him to actually give 100 million.

The day is growing late, and my mother is still waiting for me. Grandson will take his leave! After another bow, Xia Mang Guanyu slowly retreated outside the door..
