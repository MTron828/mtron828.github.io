Chapter 15: Fight!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Lin stared at Jian Wushuang coldly, while the latter looked at him indifferently.

“Jian Wushuang, it seems that I have always looked down upon you. I never expected that you had hidden yourself so deeply. Everyone thought you were trash who could not condense any Spiritual Power. But now it appears you could condense Spiritual Power long ago, and your Cultivation is not bad. You have just hidden your power and were unwilling to expose it.” Jian Lin’s voice was as cold as a knife.”About half a month ago, you exposed your Cultivation at the Third Step of Spirit Path in front of me. You faked that, didn’t you?”

“Pretend? Does he think I hid my strength for four years?” Jian Wushuang sneered inwardly but did not give an answer.

Jian Lin and the surrounding disciples could think what they liked. It didn’t matter if they thought he had hidden his strength all this time or something similar. He did not mind at all. In the Sword Marquis Mansion, what he really cared about was one person: Jian Meng’er.

Jian Wushuang’s indifference, even disregard, made Jian Lin even angrier.

“Jian Wushuang, I have passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower before. Now you have made it too, so do you dare to fight with me?” Jian Lin said directly.

“Fight with you in public?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at him.

“What? You don’t dare?”The corner of Jian Lin’s mouth turned up slightly, with a hint of disdain.

“Jian Lin, I am very curious. There are many disciples in the Sword Marquis Mansion. Why do you always target me? If you envy me because of Jian Meng’er, well, now I am done with her. Why do you still bother me? Is your mind so narrow?” Jian Wushuang asked with disdain.

His guess was correct. Jian Lin was narrow-minded, and he was filled with jealousy. As Jian Wushuang had spent so much time with Jian Meng’er in the past, this caused Jian Lin’s resentment toward him to reach its limit. Even though the relationship between them was now over, his resentment hadn’t faded at all.

“Enough talk! I am just asking whether you dare to fight me.” Jian Lin stared at Jian Wushuang firmly.

Hearing these words, Jian Wushuang’s mouth tilted slightly. He took a deep breath and raised his head again. His eyes flashed with a hint of relief. “Well, I promise you, if you want to fight, then we will fight!”

There was a stir throughout the whole Trial Tower.

“Accepted the challenge! He accepted the challenge!”

“How dare he accept it?”

“Why wouldn’t he? After all, he has passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower. Maybe his Cultivation of Spiritual Power has reached the Sixth Step, too!”

“Wait! They both passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower. Brother Jian Lin’s Cultivation reached the Peak of the Sixth Step long ago. Obviously, Jian Wushuang has been hiding his Cultivation level this whole time. Their fight will be very interesting.”

Disciples surrounding them, looking forward to the fight.

“You have got guts.”Jian Lin grinned hideously, but he didn’t look Jian Wushuang in the eye at all.

Even if he had passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower, it would not make any difference. Everyone knew that any disciple whose Cultivation had reached the Sixth Step could pass the seventh level easily. As for him, he had reached the Peak of the Sixth Step long ago!

“Take this!”

Jian Lin roared loudly and stamped his foot. He was so powerful that a crack appeared in the floor and boundless Spiritual Power poured out like a flood. Using his Spiritual Power, his right hand was clenched into a fist. Immediately he threw a punch with vast power, raising a fierce wind around him.

His Cultivation at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path burst out instantly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Many disciples present kept their eyes open. Although the fist was not aimed at them, they still could feel it’s tremendous force.

Facing the full outburst of Jian Lin’s power, Jian Wushuang kept his eyes cold and sharp. His Spiritual Power poured out slowly.

“The Sixth Step!”

“It really is the Sixth Step!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power was revealed, many disciples around him knew his true Cultivation immediately.

Although they were both at the Sixth Step, there were some differences.

“Get out of my way!”

An angry roar sounded out like a thunderbolt. Jian Wushuang struck with all his power.

“Ha-ha, you dare fight me without drawing your sword. How stupid!” Jian Lin could not help laughing.

Everyone knew that Jian Lin was at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Watching Jian Wushuang’s reaction, it was obvious that he was uncertain if he could battle this level. Under the circumstances, he would be at an absolute disadvantage if he confronted Jian Lin directly.

BANG!

Two Spiritual Power fists finally crashed together. The two fists containing hidden power exploded out at the same time.

“What?”

When Jian Lin’s fist slammed into Jian Wushuang’s, his face changed, because he felt the frightening power from Jian Wushuang’s fist.

This power was apparently stronger than his.

“How is this possible? He hasn’t reached the Peak of the Sixth Step!” Jian Lin roared in his heart.

With a heart filled with astonishment and anger, Jian Lin felt a burst of sharp pain. He groaned slightly, and blood spilt from his mouth. He retreated back ten steps, and every step was so heavy and forceful that he left deep tracks on the floor.

However, Jian Wushuang did not retreat even one step.

Outclassed!

Jian Wushuang totally surpassed Jian Lin in power!

“This…”

Many disciples were shocked.

No one had thought the competition in pure force would turn out like this.

One who obviously had not reached the Peak of the Sixth Step should not have outclassed Jian Lin who was at the Peak of the same realm!

However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill. It defied the natural order, and the Spiritual Power Warriors could release was much stronger than Warriors following other forms of cultivations. Although Jian Wushuang had not reached the Peak of the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path, the Spiritual Power he was capable of unleashing was stronger than other Warriors at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path.

In this competition, totally focused on strength, Jian Wushuang completely outclassed Jian Lin.

“I can not believe it!”

A flash of insanity appeared in Jian Lin eyes. He was repelled by Jian Wushuang. He groaned and then rushed toward Jian Wushuang. He stretched out his right hand. A tiger’s roar erupted suddenly between heaven and earth. Then, a Giant Tiger began to gradually form from the convergence of his power.

After completely materialising, the Giant Tiger charged at Jian Wushuang like lightning.

“It’s Tiger-roaring Fist!”

“Brother Jian Lin is using a Martial Arts Technique and he is using his most powerful one!”

“That Giant Tiger was totally condensed by Spiritual Power. This movement costs vast Spiritual Power, but it is really strong.”

“Look, Jian Wushuang is drawing his sword…”

“The movement of the sword!”

CHUU!

The cold sword light was shining, and then it vanished immediately. Time seemed to stop completely for a moment. In front of the shocked audience, the aggressive Giant Tiger was split into two.

CHOU… The sound of a Sword Edge piercing into the body rang out. A smear of blood splashed across Jian Lin’s shoulder.
