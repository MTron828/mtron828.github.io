Chapter 3584: News of His Survival

In the void not far away from the Life and Death Realm, the Death Slayer Master who had been running away in a panic finally stopped.

Although he had stopped, he was sure that Jian Wushuang would not come after him again. However, the Death Slayer Master still looked fearful.

“How could Blood Sword Master be so strong?” He was also terrified.

Yes, the strength that Jian Wushuang had just displayed was too strong.

It was so strong that he felt hopeless. He did not have the courage to fight back at all.

“When I struck him with my axe with all my strength, he did not move at all and his divine body was not damaged at all. Even an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm with a top-tier true treasure armor would not be able to do that, right?”

“And that sword attack just now, I couldn’t understand the mysteries of that sword at all, but with this sword attack, Gray Python Master was actually killed, and there was no room for struggle at all?” Death Slayer Master widened his eyes, in his mind, he kept recalling the scene that had just happened.

His most powerful axe attack could not shake his opponent in the slightest.

The battle strength of the Gray Python Master was barely at the pinnacle of the six realm, but the opponent had killed him with a single strike. What kind of strength was that?

“Before the Blood Sword Master disappeared, his battle strength was far less terrifying.” The Death Slayer Master narrowed his eyes again.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang must have gotten an incredible opportunity during the nearly 100,000 years that he had been missing. That was why his strength had improved by leaps and bounds, just as they had guessed, unfortunately, he and the Gray Python Master had guessed that Jian Wushuang had obtained a great opportunity, but they did not think that his strength would increase by much. However, the result was different.

“In less than 100,000 years, his strength has improved to such an extent. What kind of opportunities did he encounter during these years? What opportunities did he obtain?”

“Unfortunately, I have no way to know.” The Death Slayer Master clenched his hands,(you are reading on our content copy site.Please copy and search this link ” https://bit.ly/3NSnQtR ” to support us) he knew very well that even if Jian Wushuang had obtained an incredible opportunity, it was not something he could covet now. After all, Jian Wushuang’s strength was there. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Although I can’t get the opportunity in your hands again, I will never let go of the grudge against Gray Python Master.”

His eyes were cold.

He and Gray Python Master were good friends who had known each other for many years. They often worked together in the three battlefields, so their relationship was naturally extraordinary. Gray Python Master had died at Jian Wushuang’s hands, although they had provoked Jian Wushuang on their own initiative, he would still hold a grudge against them.

After pondering for a moment, he immediately thought of a way to take revenge on Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Sword Master, it’s true that I can’t do anything to you or take revenge for Gray Python Master, but that doesn’t mean that others can’t either.” Death Slayer Master clenched his teeth and took out token after token.

“Sky Dock Island Master, let me tell you something...”

“Mo Ye, you should be wandering around the core area of Devil Smoke Valley right now, right? I just learned something that might interest you...”

“Ice Mist King, I heard that you once had a close friend who didn’t receive any news after breaking into the Life and Death Realm. But now, someone has walked out of the Life and Death Realm alive...”

“Frost Bug master, there are many experts in the North Sea Palace. There should be many experts wandering in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. I have some news that you should be very interested in...”

Death Slayer Master took out a token and sent a message to the owner of the token. He told them that Jian Wushuang was still alive and had walked out of the Life and Death Realm.

After all, he was a Principles Master who had lived for a long time. He had roamed the three battlefields all year round, so there were many strong experts. Now, he was like all the strong experts he had met, he had sent the message, so there were about 30 to 40 experts in total.

Although most of the experts were not very strong and could not pose a threat to Jian Wushuang, he knew that after these Principles Masters heard the news, they would definitely tell him, they would immediately inform their forces or friends of the news. In this way, it would not be long before all the experts in the territory knew about the news.

After the news was completely made public, he believed that many experts would be interested in Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang was the first expert to emerge from the Life and Death Realm in a long time. No one knew the secrets of the Life and Death Realm until now.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang had disappeared in the unknown region for nearly 100,000 years. He had disappeared for 100,000 years. Now that his strength had soared, everyone could guess that he must have had a special encounter in the past 100,000 years, he must have obtained a great opportunity.

And who would not be interested in such a special opportunity and great opportunity?

He believed that once the news spread out, the entire territory would be shocked and countless experts would be eyeing Jian Wushuang.

In addition, he was careful when he spread the news. He only said that Jian Wushuang’s strength had soared after he came out of the Life and Death Realm and that he had killed the Gray Python Master, but he did not explain how Jian Wushuang had killed the Gray Python Master.

He was worried that if he spread the news that Jian Wushuang had killed the Gray Python Master in one strike under his and the Gray Python Master’s joint attack, it would scare all the experts, as a result, even though the experts knew that Jian Wushuang had a great opportunity, no one dared to find trouble with him.

It could be said that the Death Slayer Master’s plan was very clever.

The result was just as the Death Slayer Master had expected. However, after the news that Jian Wushuang had walked out of the Life and Death Realm alive and that his strength had increased drastically spread, the entire territory was in an uproar.

All the experts were shocked by the news.

They were not shocked that Jian Wushuang was still alive, but mainly because he had walked out of the Life and Death Realm.

In addition, Jian Wushuang’s strength had skyrocketed. Almost everyone had already determined that Jian Wushuang must have encountered something special and obtained a great opportunity in the past 100,000 years. Such a great opportunity was coveted by countless people.

In an instant, a large number of experts directly stared at Jian Wushuang, especially the top experts who had been adventuring in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley.

In the depths of Devil Smoke Valley, in a deep black thunder sea, a cold middle-aged man wearing a black robe and carrying a flickering black thunder on his back slowly stepped out of the Thunder Sea, his eyes were extremely sharp.

“Someone actually walked out of the Life and Death Realm alive?”

“Interesting!”

The middle-aged man in the black robe raised his head and in the next moment, he transformed into a black lightning bolt and rushed towards the direction of the Life and Death Realm.
