“No wonder.” Jian Wushaung commented.

As the heir to Ancient God Emperor, King Chen Xing had superior bloodline power compared to the rest. He was the most recognized leader of the Ancient God clan and the strongest person within the Clan. His influence was evident within the clan.

No wonder forty percent of the experts supported him.

“Wait. Ancient God Emperor was an expert in the first era. He should have died when the first era ended. Wouldn’t?that mean that King Chen Xing also came from the first era if he was the son?” Jian Wushuang said, startled.

“Yes. Ancient God Emperor had three sons in the first era and King Chen Xing was the youngest. During the first era, he was not powerful and was not a Nine-star Ancient God. He was just an Eight-star ancient god. After the first era ended, Ancient God emperor and his elder two sons died. He survived with a minimal number of ancient gods. They started to reproduce and eventually formed the Ancient God Clan today!”

“In fact, all of the three most powerful tribes are living legacies from the first era,” King Luo Yu said.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

“No wonder. It seems like King Chen Xing made great contributions to the Ancient God Clan.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

King Chen Xing managed to lead a tribe which had barely survived the first era to become a dominating force in the second era. His ability and power deserved respect from the general population of Ancient Gods.

“King Chen Xing made great contributions to the Ancient God Clan. However, he will admit to only his father having a purer bloodline power. It is to no surprise that he acted with hostility towards me when he learnt that I support you in becoming the new Ancient God Emperor,” King Luo Yu said. “I am no match for King Chen Xing as he is a powerful man. Furthermore, he gained the support of one of the Nine-star Ancient Gods from the Zhan Clan. All I could do was stay within Luo Wang City to think of ideas.”

Jian Wushuang nodded his head to show that he understood.

“King Chen Xing sealed off Luo King City during this time period. It is extremely difficult for us to leave the city, let alone for us to force King Chen Xing to back off. We were no match for him. Now that you are here, it should be much easier to solve the existing problems,” King Luo Yu said with a serious face.

“How so?” Jian Wushuang looked at King Luo Yu with interest.

“The Ancient Clan puts bloodline power above all else. No matter how big the contributions of King Chen Xing and no matter how widespread his influence is, it will not change this fact. The reason why forty percent of the clan supports him is because they have yet to see you. Hence, they are not sure whether you possess the bloodline of emperors!”

“Since you have arrived at Ancient God Sanctuary, those remaining thirty percent who have yet to make up their minds will definitely support you!” King Luo Yu said.

“The masters of the king cities and various clans may be willing to support me. However, King Chen Xing probably will not even if he verifies that I have the bloodline of emperors,” Jian Wushuang said.

“This....” King Luo Yu frowned and said. “King Jian Chen will only submit to his father. It is not possible for him to serve you willingly. However, there is no way he could influence the will of the masses in the Ancient God Clan.”

“Even though that may be the case, it will be much better if King Xing Chen decides to serve me willingly,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “By the way, what is the power level of King Xing Chen?”

“King Xing Chen is unanimously thought of as the strongest in the Ancient God Clan. His power level is at the limit of a Nine-star Ancient God and he is the second strongest in the Special tribe. His fighting power should be similar to that of a normal stage two great emperor.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

A normal stage two emperor?

Jian Wushuang possessed one of the highest fighting powers out of all the stage two great emperor. If this was the case, he should be more powerful than King Chen Xing given that the emperor bloodline power would further suppress the fighting power of King Chen Xing...

“Lead the way, King Luo Yu. I want to meet King Chen Xing,” Jian Wushuang said as he stood up.

King Luo Yu face turned pale. “There is a great difference in power between our faction and his faction. To go and find King Chen Xing now would be suicide. I think we should send a message to the other three percent of the clan and to the masters of the different cities. We will gather together before finding King Chen Xing. This is a much safer way.”

“Let us save the trouble. We shall head there now.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

King Luo Yu frowned and stopped trying to discourage the Sword Emperor.

Under the guidance of King Luo Yu, Jian Wushuang left Luo Wang City and reached a vast void.

There were large groups of buildings floating within this void. There were many faint but overbearing auras radiating out from the buildings.

“King Chen Xing is within those buildings, Sword Emperor. I shall call him to come and meet us,” King Luo Yu said.

“There is no need.” Jian Wushuang waved him off. “Wait for me here. I will find him personally.”

“You are going alone? No way!” King Luo Yu was shocked.

“Calm down and watch what happens.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he moved towards the buildings.

King Luo Yu turned pale and the remaining Ancient Gods present were puzzled.

They felt that the Sword Emperor was too arrogant.

It was obvious that King Chen Xing was not on good terms with the Sword Emperor. They felt like the Sword Emperor was asking for it when he entered the home of King Chen Xing alone. He clearly knew that he might be killed.

King Gu You and King Gu Tong were the only two people that remained calm.

“King Luo Yu, there is something I have yet to report.” King Gu You said.

“What is it?” King Luo Yu sound agitated as he was clearly worried for the safety of Jian Wushuang.

“When King Gu Tong, Sword Emperor and I were on our way back to Luo Wang City, we met Zhan Cang.” King Gu You said.

“Zhan Cang?” King Luo Yu face tightened. “Nine-star royal Ancient God?Zhan Cang. He must have been listening to King Chen Xing’s orders and went after Sword Emperor. How did all of you escape?”

“Escape? There was no need to run. Sword Emperor fought Zhan Cang and beat him with just one move,” King Gu You said as he shook his head.
