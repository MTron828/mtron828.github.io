Chapter 1214: Tragic

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushaung, like I said, you have no chance,” Gumu King growled.

“Impressive,” Jian Wushuang said, looking surprised.

“Let’s do it together,” Gumu King gave an order coldly.

The Four Peak Universe Masters around him started right away.

Gumu King waved her silk ribbon, which attacked Jian Wushuang like a snake.

Mo King waved the heavy sword, which was huge enough to cover half of the Void.

Donglong King looked cold and rushed out, like a flash of lightning. His hand suddenly turned into a dragon’s claw and came down.

Tianchen King waved his long stick.

All of them were straining as hard as they could.

“Get out of the way!” Jian Wushuang shouted, panicking.

With cold eyes, Jian Wushuang burst out with Sword Essence. The whole world abruptly turned dark .

Sword light struck like the first light of morning dawn.

Bang!

It crushed all the moves of the four Peak Universe Masters in a flash.

“What?” said Gumu King.

“Our joint offensive was smashed in a twinkling?” asked Mo King.

“No wonder he defeated Long Xu King!” cried Donglong King.

The four Peak Universe Masters spoke in wonderment. After smashing their offensive, the Stroke of Dawn remained powerful and rushed directly at Gumu King.

Whoosh! Someone rushed and stood in front of her.

“Tianchen King!” Gumu King’s eyes lit up.

“Leave it to me!” Tianchen King said with a sombre look. Suddenly, a golden halo appeared, forming a golden bell over Tianchen King. Another golden bell inside him began to shudder like crazy, bursing out with a dazzling, golden light.

Clang!

The Stroke of Dawn hit the golden bell. Its golden halo faded, but returned back to normal after a few minutes.

“Hum?” Jian Wushuang asked in confusion, slightly changing his expression.?“I didn’t expect them to have such a protection treasure. This is a problem,”?he thought to himself.

In one-on-one fights, Jian Wushuang was confident he could beat and even kill them. Unexpectedly, they attacked him together, however. They were good at attacking, tying, rushing, and offending, respectively.

They cooperated with each other in perfect unison. Even Jian Wushuang found it hard to beat them quickly.

What was worse, they were determined to hold him up so that he could not get away.

“Well, then I have do this,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang squinted and trembled. Soon the second Original Body appeared out of nowhere, followed by Gu King, who rushed over to help. He headed directly for other battlefields.

“That’s… a doppelganger?” they said in unison, all shocked.

“Indeed. We, four, managed to stop him with some effort. I don’t think it’s possible to stop his doppelganger at the same time, though,” Mo King said in a low voice.

“Normally, a doppelganger has a weaker battle strength than the Original Body. All we need to do is to stop him. Leave the doppelganger to the others,” Gumu King said seriously, and?then added, “Let’s go!”

Swoosh!

Again, the four Peak Universe Masters rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

His first Original Body also went up.

The first Original Body was stopped. However, his second Original Body was still fighting on the battlefield freely. Without the Blood-killing Armor, the second Original Body was stronger than ordinary Peak Universe Masters, but not as strong as supreme ones.

The cooperation of Gu King still enabled him to fight in every direction on the battlefield. However, he failed to fight as fiercely as he had before.

On the large battlefield, the experts from the two camps fought at close quarters. The battle reached a white-hot stage.

Jian Wushuang had worked with Gu King to kill more than 400 Holy Masters in one stroke. Besides that, many other experts were slaughtered by him. The Gold Kingdom was absolutely terrified.

When Jian Wushuang’s first Original Body was stopped, the Gold Kingdom gradually recovered from the shock. Afterwards, the difference in overall strength between two camps was revealed.

Even if more than 400 Holy Master had been killed, the remaining Holy Masters of the Gold Kingdom were not inferior to those of the Green Fire World.

Their Universe Masters were still stronger.

As the killing got more and more fierce, the Gold Kingdom looked more and more advanced.

“Come on and kill them!” Hongxue King shouted.

Hongxue King laughed and pierced his long spear through the Void mercilessly. Blood-speckled snow fell when his spear upon a large, Green Dragon Tactical Formation and pierced through its vast body smoothly.

Boom! The giant green dragon fell apart. Thousands of Dao Masters, who formed the tactical formation, suddenly scattered and ran in fear. The Red Snow King pierced again, unleashing horrible power that killed almost half of them. Only a few Dao Masters managed to flee.

They desperately fled towards the Battle Fortress. Unfortunately, few of them succeeded to enter.

A tactical formation could be very powerful, enabling Holy Masters to fight powerfully. There was, however, a fatal flaw.

As soon as a tactical formation broke down, the Holy Masters could not quickly reform again. They could do nothing, except be slaughtered.

Ever since the war had begun, the Holy Masters of the Green Fire World had formed thousands of tactical formations. Now, a third of them had broken down.

Over 80% of the Holy Masters involved had been killed mercilessly.

Without the tactical formation, the Holy Masters may easily be killed unintentionally, even if they weren’t targeted.

Tragic!

It was tragic for the entire battlefield.

Experts from both sides were crazy.

“Aha, they’re worn out. Go and kill them!” shouted the Red Snow King.

The roaring of the Red Snow King reverberated over the sky. The experts on his side also roared, which boosted their morale.

On the contrary, the Green Fire World seemed to be defeated.

“Alright, time to retreat!” said a Master from the Green Fire World.

Samsara Temple Master watched this coldly. He gave an order.

“Retreat!” he shouted.

“Back to the Battle Fortress!” he continued. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At his command, experts of the Green Fire World, including large tactical formations, immediately left their opponents and returned to the hold of the Battle Fortress at an amazing pace.

The two Original Bodies of Jian Wushuang also turned and left.
