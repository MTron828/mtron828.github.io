Chapter 2165 Something“s Not Righ

At the Void near the edge of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai, and Ancestor Tian Chen stood side by side. Jian Yi stood behind Jian Wushuang.“The Three Emperors World has so many trump cards, not bad,” Jian Wushuang looked at the three Destruction Divine Weapons from afar, and could not help sighing.

“This is even after we conquered the Imperial City. Imagine what they could pull if we had not,” Ancestor Tian Chen said. “The trump cards they possess now are comparable to ours, but ours beats them slightly. In terms of fighting strength, our side has the absolute advantage.”

Putting the trump cards aside, regardless of the Sir Gods and Emperor God’s battles, or the Great Emperor level duels, the Eternal Chaotic World held the absolute advantage, and that advantage was increasing consistently.

There was a significant gap in the quantity and quality of experts on both sides from the very beginning.

If the fighting continued, they would take no more than half a day to decimate the Three Emperors World forces.

“It is too early to say. The Three Emperors World leaders have not made their moves yet,” Emperor Bai said. “In terms of the highest Third Stage fighting power, we are not as good as them.” Ancestor Tian Chen and Jian Wushuang nodded.

Third Stage Great Emperor fighting powers… only Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang possessed that in the Eternal Chaotic World.

On the other side, the Three Emperors World had Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Ba Su, making it four people.

Among them, Kaiser Blood’s strength was estimated to be close to Emperor Bai’s, and Lord Fen was definitely stronger than Jian Wushuang. It would be easier to handle Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su.

“Kaiser Blood’s methods are unfathomable. Even I do not have absolute confidence in winning. If we were to really fight, I’m afraid he alone could keep me busy,” Emperor Bai said.

“If I put in my best, I could block Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu together, but it’ll be hard. Ba Su’s the weakest. Jian Yi, could you block him?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Jian Yi.

Jian Yi himself was at pinnacle Second Stage fighting powers and an Ancient Era expert.

“I can try,” Jian Yi said.

“We can think of ways to block these four Third Stage Great Emperors, but there is one more person besides them, have you all realised?” Emperor Bai asked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned towards the Void.

A fifth figure stood there.

In addition to Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Ba Su, there was one more person.

It was a veiled woman with a perfect figure!

“Leng Ruxue!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with astonishing sharpness, his gaze fixated on the only woman amongst the others.

That Leng Ruxue seemed to have felt Jian Wushuang’s gaze as well and smiled at him.

“Something’s wrong,” Jian Wushuang’s face sunk.

“What’s wrong?” Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen looked towards him.

“Don’t you feel that the Three Emperors World leaders are too calm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Too calm?” Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen frowned and squinted at the leaders.

Indeed, the leaders were very calm.

All of them were indifferent, and one could not sense any form of anxiety from them.

“That’s strange, the Three Emperors World forces are about to lose at any moment. But they don’t seem to be in a hurry,” Ancestor Tian Chen’s eyebrows frowned.

The battle concerned the life and death of the two camps.

Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai, Ancestor Tian Chen and the rest were anxious to defeat their enemy.

They only hope to defeat them.

But Kaiser Blood and the rest?

It seemed like they were in no hurry at all.

“You mean, they don’t care that they were losing?”

“Or perhaps they had another trump card,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The Three Emperors World had carefully planned and prepared for so many years, their methods unfathomable. Maybe they have other trump cards that could turn the tables around, we must be careful,” Emperor Bai looked coldly. “Tian Chen, send a message, get our army to be on their guard, even the Great Emperors as well.”

“Understood,” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head, and said, “Rest assured, even if they have other tricks up their sleeve, so do we. We still have three Emperor Tokens unused.”

The Emperor Token was crafted by him personally, and contained a full blow!

However, his power was too strong. The Eternal Chaotic World was simply unable to create a token that could contain his full blow. They could not even create one that could contain the full blow of a normal Great Emperor. Even if they managed to create one, there was still a high probability of failure within it.

Therefore, there was almost no token with Great Emperor powers within the Eternal Chaotic World.

The most they could do was to use some special treasures, sacrifice a great portion of Great Emperor Divine Power, and find another capable Great Emperor to guide the power,and?only then could they barely create the token. Jian Wushuang had encountered similar attacks in the past, but it was nothing compared to the full blow of a Great Emperor.

The fact that Emperor Bai was able to create the Emperor Token was due to the ten high-level tokens he had found in ancient battlefields.

He had spent a long time experimenting, finally creating three. The remaining tokens were wasted and destroyed.

“The three Emperor Tokens are held by two Great Emperors and one pinnacle Emperor God now. The three of them are separated into different corners of the battlefield as well, for them to use anytime they need to,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Good,” Emperor Bai nodded.

But Jian Wushuang’s face was still cold.

He felt that there was more behind the calmness of the Three Emperors World leaders.
