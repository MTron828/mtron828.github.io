Chapter 2847: Was Done!

——

“After absorbing three drops of perfect blood essence and devouring so many treasures, including a 12,000-pound Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, you still can’t satisfy your appetite?” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly, he had nothing left for the Blood Mountain Sword to continue devouring.

At this moment, Lord Mo, who had been standing beside the Holy Heavenly Furnace, frowned slightly. Then, he flipped his hand and took out all kinds of treasures from his interspatial ring.

“Lord Mo?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Lord Mo did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang. He just kept throwing those treasures into the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

But Lord Mo was the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. He was also a powerful Immortal Saint who was rich.

Especially in all kinds of materials and treasures.

Therefore, under Jian Wushuang’s shocked gaze, Lord Mo took out one after another precious materials and treasures.

Each of these treasures was extraordinary. Many of them were priceless. There were several treasures that were comparable to the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, and some were even more precious.

In addition, there were some treasures that Jian Wushuang did not know and could not name. However, they were obviously extraordinary treasures. Lord Mo threw them into the Holy Heavenly Furnace, and all the treasures that he threw into it were devoured by the Blood Mountain Sword on the spot.

Jian Wushuang saw them and could not help but feel sorry for Lord Mo...

However, Lord Mo’s expression was very calm, as if what was thrown into the Holy Heavenly Furnace were not priceless treasures, but just pieces of ordinary firewood.

After nearly half an hour, Lord Mo had thrown at least hundreds of treasures into the Holy Heavenly Furnace.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Blood Mountain Sword finally stopped absorbing.

“Finally full?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and stared at the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

Buzz!

There was still a loud sword chime.

The sword chime also carried a supreme sword essence.

But the difference was that this sword’s intent was more than ten times stronger than the previous sword’s intent!

This sword intent truly shook the past and the present!

Inside and outside the Fire Cloud Castle, countless cultivators stood there in shock. Feeling the sword intent that had increased by more than ten times, they were all stunned.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the weathered old man had already stood up. With his hands behind his back, he looked in the direction of the Fire Cloud Castle, but his frown deepened.

On the nameless peak, the silver-haired handsome man narrowed his eyes.

The youth who had been sitting cross-legged by the side was suddenly overjoyed. “Master, I can sense it, I can sense it!”

“There’s nothing to be proud of,” the handsome man said in a low voice. “If you could sense it before, it would be considered powerful. But now... that sword intent has increased by dozens of times. If you can’t sense it again, you’re not qualified to be my disciple.”

Hearing this, the young man curled his lips, but he did not know what to say.

Under the huge volcano.

“Is it done?”

Lord Mo was a little excited, even more excited than Jian Wushuang.

He stared at the Holy Heavenly Furnace in front of him and then made a few more handprints.

The purple-black flames around the Holy Heavenly Furnace swept crazily, and a magic sword slowly rose from the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

“Condense!”

Lord Mo struck out his last hand seal.

The supreme sword essence emitted by the divine sword was instantly withdrawn, and the light on the longsword slowly faded. The Blood Mountain Sword also returned to its original appearance.

As Jian Wushuang waved his hand, the Blood Mountain Sword immediately rushed toward Jian Wushuang and was once again in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

As soon as he held the sword, he immediately noticed that it was different from before.

Previously, although the Blood Mountain Sword was his natal magic weapon and connected with his heart and blood, it was not perfect.

But now... Jian Wushuang felt that the Blood Mountain Sword was completely one with him.

It was as if the Blood Mountain Sword was already a part of his body, like his hands and feet. He could use it perfectly.

“As expected, after merging with my blood essence, my control of the Blood Mountain Sword has become even more perfect. Moreover, after absorbing three drops of my perfect blood essence and devouring so many rare and precious treasures, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword should have been greatly enhanced.” Jian Wushuang slightly tightened his grip on the divine sword, then he carefully examined the Blood Mountain Sword.

Just as he had expected, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword had been greatly enhanced.

Previously, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was only at the superior heavenly treasure level.

But now... although he had not really attacked, Jian Wushuang could still feel that the true power of the Blood Mountain Sword had reached the level of a holy treasure.

And it was definitely much stronger than an ordinary holy treasure.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang found that the sword edge of the Blood Mountain Sword had become sharper. To be exact, it was extremely sharp!

“This sword edge...” Jian Wushuang touched the sword edge with his fingers. He had an illusion that as long as the Blood Mountain Sword exerted a little force, his palm would be directly cut off, no matter how strong his protective ability was or what kind of defensive means he had on the surface of his body.

Jian Wushuang even subconsciously felt that even if the cultivator in front of him was wearing a body-protection armor at the level of holy treasure, the sword edge of the Blood Mountain Sword was enough to tear apart the body-protection armor at the level of holy treasure, then he continued to kill his opponent.

It was this sharp feeling that could tear apart and cut through all obstacles.

As for how sharp it was, Jian Wushuang had to experience real combat and kill a cultivator with the Blood Mountain Sword before he knew.

“Its power has become much stronger, and its blade is much sharper than before. Compared to before, the transformation of the Blood Mountain Sword is indeed huge, but that should not be all.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

The Blood Mountain Sword had fused with three drops of his perfect blood essence.

According to the effect of three drops of blood essence, it should be more than that.

Jian Wushuang immediately continued to study it.

As he studied it, he soon found the deepest thing hidden in the Blood Mountain Sword.

“This is... sword essence?” Jian Wushuang’s expression had become extremely stunned.

It was not his fault, because he felt the existence of a sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword.

This sword essence was none other than the supreme sword essence that the Blood Mountain Sword had wantonly released!

That sword intent was not too strong, but it was too detached. It was so detached that it made one’s hair stand on end!

But this sword intent was completely preserved in the Blood Mountain Sword.
