Chapter 3013: Changes

——

“He just broke through to become an Immortal Saint, and his divine might is actually much stronger than a third level True Saint?”

Lord Wu, who had been extremely confident just a moment ago that the person they were chasing was definitely not just a supreme god, was immediately stunned when he received this news.

“How is that possible? Are you sure that your senses aren’t wrong?” Lord Wu immediately replied and asked.

“No. This is still because we are quite far away from the place where this person broke through. If we were closer, the divine might we would have sensed would have been even more intense. And now, we have also asked the cultivators in Blood Dipper City. We can confirm that there is indeed a person who has just broken through to become an Immortal Saint, but he should have already left by now,” the True Saint in Blood Dipper City replied.

Lord Wu’s expression became strange when he received an affirmative answer.

One had to know that divine might and divine power aura were different.

Divine power aura only reflected a cultivator’s true realm.

Divine might was determined by the strength of divine power.

If a cultivator’s divine might was comparable to a rank three True Saint, then his divine power was also comparable to a rank three True Saint.

But now, this cultivator who had just broken through to become an undying saint was much stronger than a rank three True Saint. This meant that his divine power was stronger than many rank three True Saints.

But how was this possible?

How could an Immortal Saint who had just broken through have such incredible divine power?

“Lord Wu, we suspect that the Immortal Saint who has just broken through might be the ‘criminal’ we’ve been searching for,” The True Saint from Blood Dipper City sent another message.

Hearing this, Lord Wu’s determination had already wavered.

“Could it be that the person who killed Tian Mound King and Stone Saint in a single move is really just a Divine Master?” Lord Wu muttered.

If he had thought of this before, he would definitely think that he was crazy.

But now, he did not dare to make such a conclusion.

Because the scene that had happened now was completely beyond his imagination.

An Immortal Saint who had just broken through was much stronger than a rank three True Saint. Did that not mean that when he was at the supreme-being level, his divine power was not weaker than a rank two True Saint?

“Go find him!”

“Whether this person is the person we’re looking for or not, we have to find him first!”

“Since he was still in Blood Dipper City just now, he must be in the territory near Blood Dipper City now. Inform the Magic Note Army and the experts nearby to gather there as quickly as possible. That person has already broken through, and he is a genuine Immortal Saint. He is far more eye-catching than the previous Divine Master level. It should be much easier to find him.”

Lord Wu immediately gave the order.

The True Saint experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, including the sergeants of the Magic Note Army, immediately took action upon receiving Lord Wu’s order.

Countless experts crazily gathered in the area around the Blood Dipper City.

…

Jian Wushuang, who had just come out of the Blood Dipper City, flew for four hours in a valley not far from the Blood Dipper City. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the void in the center of the valley, Jian Wushuang stood there with a cold and arrogant figure.

He was feeling the changes in himself.

It was a huge transformation from a Divine Master to an Immortal Saint. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had long mastered the immortal body and had a strong foundation. He had become an Immortal Saint from a Divine Master, he skipped the False Saint Realm and directly became a rank one True Saint.

It was a huge leap from Divine Master to rank one True Saint. He had improved a lot in all aspects of his body. However, he did not have the time to feel the changes in his body because he had made too much noise in Blood Dipper City.

But now, he could feel it.

First, the most basic aspects were divine power and the divine body.

“My divine power is as vast as the sea. It’s hundreds or thousands of times more than that of cultivators of the same level. Even though I’m only a Divine Master, my divine power is much more vast than that of many True Saints. Now that I’ve broken through to True Saint, my divine power hasn’t increased much, but in terms of the strength of my divine power…”

Jian Wushuang suddenly shook his hand.

A burst of explosive power immediately gathered in his hand. He even felt that the space in his hand was about to explode.

“How much stronger is this power compared to my previous strength?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He could feel that his divine power was at least a hundred times stronger than before, or even more.

However, because the strength of his divine power had increased so much, he could not accurately judge the power of his divine power.

“Although I don’t know how much, it’s at least stronger than an ordinary rank three True Saint,” Jian Wushuang thought.

It was Jian Wushuang’s most basic judgment to be stronger than a rank three True Saint. However, he did not know how much stronger it was until he fought with a rank three True Saint.

In terms of the divine body, the Immortal Saint’s divine body was also much stronger than that of a Divine Master.

In addition, his soul, bones, blood essence, and even cells had undergone earth-shaking changes, which Jian Wushuang could sense.

Most importantly, there was another big change after he broke through to become an Immortal Saint.

That was, he could sense more and more rules of heaven and earth from his surroundings.

He realized that he could comprehend the principles of heaven and earth at a speed more than ten times faster than a Divine Master!

It was not only the principles of heaven and earth but also his comprehension of Dao.

“As expected, the Immortal Saint and the Divine Master are two completely different concepts!”

“After becoming an Immortal Saint, it’s easier and easier to comprehend the rules of heaven and earth and the Dao than it is at the Divine Master realm. Because of this, it’s easier for the Immortal Saints to create their own unique skills.” Jian Wushuang sighed secretly.

When a cultivator reached a certain level, they would see a new world.

That was the truth.

“I used to comprehend the rules much faster with the help of three heaven-sealing scrolls. But now, even without the help of the heaven-sealing scroll, I can comprehend the rules faster than before.” Jian Wushuang laughed to himself.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang exhaled heavily. He had a certain understanding of the changes in himself and knew that he had improved in all aspects. Naturally, his strength had also increased by many times.

However, his strength had not only improved after he broke through to become an Immortal Saint. After all, once he became an Immortal Saint, the secret skills he cultivated could also be improved.
