Chapter 2393: The Only Possibility

Narcissus Island, Pavilion of Divine Mystery.

Jian Wushuang and his group who returned from Luogu Territory were reporting the results of their task in the Pavilion of Divine Mystery.

They failed to complete the given task.

Although disciplinary elders were surprised by the outcome, they did not question any further.

After that, Jian Wushuang went his separate ways with Xiao Heng and others at the Divine Mystery Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang had explicitly requested them not to spread the news of his strength as he did not want to be noticed. He preferred to be just an outer disciple in Narcissus Island while taking his time to slowly recover his strength.

Xiao Heng and his group agreed without hesitation.

However, Elder Wujian was not about to allow Jian Wushuang to enjoy the calm and tranquil life that he anticipated.

On the night that Jian Wushuang returned to Narcissus Island, Elder Wujian went to the outer court himself and found Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, what’s the matter? I’ve heard about the task at Luogu Territory. Although it was a little difficult, it should be easy with your abilities. How could you all fail?” Elder Wujian frowned and sat down. He had received news from the Divine Mystery Pavilion that Jian Wushuang had failed in his mission.

Elder Wujian paid particular interest in the mission as he had handpicked that for Jian Wushuang. However, the outcome was out of his expectations.

“Elder Wujian, you have had too high hopes for me. Even Senior Brother Xiao Heng and the others couldn’t handle it. How could I be of much help?” Jian Wushuang derided himself.

“You kid, don’t pretend in front of me. The others might not know you, but I do. Let’s be frank about it. What’s going on?” asked Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang paused as Elder Wujian knew about his strength. It was not going to be easy for him to play dumb.

Jian Wushuang replied instantly, “Elder Wujian, let me tell you this. This mission is not as simple as you imagined. The Second Miss Mu, which we were supposed to rescue was not an easy one. The mission was not something that could be done effortlessly by me, Senior Brother Xiao Heng, and the rest. Even if I tried my best, I’m still unable to do it. As for the specific reasons, it’s not convenient for me to say anymore, but it will not take long before you find out.”

Elder Wujian frowned. “Oh? A task which you can’t solve even with your full effort. This is interesting. Did you say that the Second Miss Mu is not as easy one? Now, that’s interesting. Do you want me to find out more about the Second Miss Mu?”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “No. Elder Wujian, this mission has nothing to do with Narcissus Island, so I advise you not to get involved. Otherwise, I’m afraid that neither you nor Narcissus Island could afford to pay the consequences.”

Elder Wujian’s complexion changed slightly.

Even Narcissus Island could not handle the consequences? Was it that severe and terrorizing?

Elder Wujian smiled slightly. “Fine. I’m not someone who purposely snoops around for trouble. Since you have said so, I will just put the matter at rest. I’ll arrange a new task for you in a few days since you have failed to complete this one.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head again. “There is no need for it. Elder Wujian, I know what I need most at this point, so please don’t burden me with any task. If you mean well for me, you can help me find these materials, which I need for crafting something.”

“Materials for crafting? Alright, what do you need? I’ll get the people to immediately send it to you,” said Elder Wujian with a smile.

He did not take those crafting materials seriously because he had known Jian Wushuang was a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. He had never thought that a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm would request for anything extraordinary.

Narcissus Island was one of the top ten sects among the many sects in the Wusha Wilderness. He could quickly come up with any common refining materials.

“Elder Wujian, you’d better take a look before you promise me.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly and took out a list.

Elder Wujian took it and briefly glanced through it. His hands were trembling as he went wide-eyed.

“Jian Wushuang, are these the materials you are looking for?” Elder Wujian’s surprised expression was rather entertaining to look at.

That was the list of materials needed to craft a Life Armor.

Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Purple Shimmer, Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and Celestial Iron Ore.

Among them, it required four portions of Red Sun Secret Essence.

Five Red Blood Fruit!

Two drops of Purple Shimmer!

A hundred pieces of the Spectacular Beast’s scales! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ten thousand catties of Celestial Iron Ore!

“Elder Wujian, is there a problem?” asked Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Elder Wujian roared, “Is there a problem? Of course, there is a problem! Jian Wushuang, do you know the value of these crafting materials that you are looking for?”

“Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Purple Shimmer, and Spectacular Beast’s Scales. Which one of these were not nearly extinct in the Wusha Wilderness?”

“Celestial Iron Ore is the only common material I see from the list, but you need a whopping 10,000 catties of it. How on earth do I get hold of so many?”

“Let’s not talk about if we have all these in Narcissus Island. Even if they are available, I can’t possibly single-handedly give them away.”

Elder Wujian was speechless. He had thought of using his authority as an elder to grant Jian Wushuang’s wishes of getting any crafting materials that he needed. However, he was perplexed to see the list of materials that Jian Wushuang was looking for.

“So, you really don’t have them?”

Jian Wushuang raised his brows, he did not look surprised.

“Elder Wujian, I really need these things. Forget about it if you don’t have them in Narcissus Island. I hope that Elder Wujian will look around for me. If these things appear in Wusha Wilderness in the future, please tell me,” said Jian Wushuang humbly.

Elder Wujian nodded. “Yes. My advice for you is not to have much hope as for these things are not easily available even to a strong expert who is beyond the Divine Demon Realm. An expert like that might be able to locate a thing or two out of the list with his influence. Still, it’s almost impossible for you to get so many of them within the Wusha Wilderness unless you can get the Great Compassionate Sect to come forward!”

The Great Compassion Sect is the number one sect in the Wusha Wilderness and has the deepest and strongest foundation. I think the Great Compassion Sect might have some of the materials you need. If you could make use of its influence to collect the rest of it, you may stand a chance to find them all.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly as an idea sprouted in his heart.

Nonetheless, Elder Wujian never thought that Jian Wushuang could do it.

“Alright Jian Wushuang, if you intend to be just an outer disciple, then you can carry on with your cultivation here. I’ll make a move.” Elder Wujian left.

Jian Wushuang was lost in thought.

‘The Great Compassion Sect... Only the Great Compassion Sect in the entire Wusha Wilderness could collect these crafting materials?’ thought Jian Wushuang.

“If I had known this, I should’ve accepted the invitation from the County of Anjiu Commandery to join the Great Compassion Sect. Perhaps, I could easily get hold of these materials,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He was just toying with the idea of joining the Great Compassion Sect as the fact remains that he was reluctant to do so.
