Chapter 587: Firmament Territory Feast

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Firmament Territory Feast?” Jian Wushuang asked quizzically, “Senior, what is Firmament Territory Feast?”

Jian Wushuang had not heard of the Firmament Territory Feast.

“Firmament Territory Feast is a genius feast!”

Emperor Xiao began to explain.

“Kid, you should know that both my old friend and I are from the Ancient World,” Emperor Xiao said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jian Wushuang knew that although the Ancient World was vast, there were even larger swathes of land beyond the Ancient World.

People like Emperor Xiao, Leng Rushuang and Di Jing were all from another vast world.

“The Ancient World is a huge world on this plane. Above it, there is the Eternal World,” Emperor Xiao said.

“The Eternal World?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

It was his first time hearing of the Eternal World.

“The Eternal World is enormous. You can’t even imagine how huge its territory is. I’ve lived there for numerous years, but I still haven’t fully explored the area,” Emperor Xiao said.

“The Eternal World is the core of the universe. Now, you are in the Ancient World, which is only a tiny part of the Eternal World. There is only one Eternal World, but there are countless Ancient Worlds.”

“Countless?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

“You thought there’s only one Ancient World?” Emperor Xiao laughed. He continued, “There are lots of territories in the Eternal World. This Ancient World is under control of Firmament Territory.”

“In the Eternal World, Firmament Territory is considered a huge territory and it controls millions of Ancient Worlds.”

“Even though the Ancient Worlds are controlled by the Firmament Territory, there isn’t a direct route from the Ancient World to the Eternal World.”

“In the Ancient World, the Ancient World Token is the only one way for warriors like you to go to the Eternal World!”

“The Ancient World Token?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Previously, he had received a message from Temple Master Black Spirit when he broke through the Earth Core Palace. It had told him that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Iceberg were very eager to steal his compass because it was related to an Ancient World Token.

He hadn’t known then the purpose of the Ancient World Token.

Now, he finally understood that the token was the only way to get into the Eternal World.

“There are many Sects in the Firmament Territory. Every three years, there is a Firmament Territory Feast where geniuses gather, including experts from the Skyscraping Realm Level. Warriors who have Ancient World Tokens in the Ancient World can also join the genius feast,” Emperor Xiao answered.

“However, there are limitations. There are only five Ancient World Tokens in one Ancient World, meaning only five people can participate in the Firmament Territory Feast. If they perform well at the feast, they can join a Sect. Even if no Sect accepts them, they can still choose to stay in the Firmament Territory.”

“That’s it?” Understanding dawned on Jian Wushuang.

This explained why Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Iceberg were trying so hard to get an Ancient World Token. It was really very valuable.

Jian Wushuang realized that the Ancient World would not appeal to Skyscraping Realm experts whose strength had already reached the top. The vast Eternal World would become their new goal.

As there were only five tokens, and it was the only way to enter the Eternal World, the value of the Ancient World Tokens was tremendous.

It would not be surprising for people in the Skyscraping Realm to war over an Ancient World Token.

It represented a chance to go to the vast Eternal World, take part in the Firmament Territory and join the Sects.

“Emperor Xiao, you mentioned that you would take me to the Firmament Territory Feast?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Yes.” Emperor Xiao nodded slightly.

“But I don’t have an Ancient World Token. Even I did, I am only a Nine-cloud Realm, so I don’t think I’m qualified to join the Firmament Territory Feast?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

“Yes, you don’t have any Ancient World Token now, but your ancestor has prepared one for you,” Emperor Xiao answered with a smile.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

His ancestor should be the Sword Ancestor!

The Sword Ancestor had already got an Ancient World Token for him?

“Well...” Jian Wushuang contemplated the possibilities and soon he understood.

“No wonder the Sword Ancestor got attacked by millions of experts in the Skyscraping Realm Level,”?Jian Wushuang sighed.

When Jian Wushuang had been in the Divine Land, he had found out that the Sword Ancestor had been attacked by many Skyscraping Realm experts because he had a treasure with a big secret.

Now, he finally understood that the Sword Ancestor’s treasure was an Ancient World Token!

The Ancient World Token was the only treasure that could help him get into the Eternal World. Most importantly, there were only five in the Ancient World.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Iceberg’s attitudes towards the Ancient World Token showed how important the token was. Jian Wushuang only had a compass that was related to the Ancient World Token, but Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Iceberg already fought for it desperately.

The Sword Ancestor had an actual Ancient World Token, so this would definitely cause a stir when the news was exposed.

“As for your Realm, you don’t need to worry about it. The Firmament Territory Feast will start in another three years. During these years, you can go back to the Nanyang Continent first and deal with all the remaining stuff in the Divine Land. After that you can follow me, I can help you break through the Realm during these three years. I’ll also help you to improve your strength to another new level,” the Emperor Xiao answered with a confident attitude.

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“You can leave now and find Di Jing. He will show you the tunnel that can take you back to the Nanyang Continent. Go there as fast as possible. If you get there late, I’m afraid the Sword Marquis Mansion will be destroyed,” the Emperor Xiao answered.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

If he got there late, the Sword Marquis Mansion would be destroyed?

He knew that Emperor Xiao would not lie to him.

“Senior Emperor Xiao, I’m leaving now!”

Jian Wushuang was anxious. Without any hesitation, he turned away and left.
