Chapter 3227: Ending One’s Own Life

——

Boom!

Green rod shadows appeared out of thin air. These green rod shadows overlapped each other and completely gathered together. In addition, these green rod shadows also contained two different types of principles energy.

The principles of light and the principles of wind, two different types of principles energy, perfectly fused together.

It was because of the fusion of these two different types of principles energy that this staff strike was incomparably terrifying.

Looking at this staff strike, Di Hao’s pupils constricted. In the next moment, the destructive aura around his body rose explosively, and the huge ax in his hand was also raised high up.

At the instant he raised it, a shocking might started to gather within the huge ax, and two different types of principles energy pervaded from it.

These two types of principles energy were the destruction principles and the space-time principles!

“This ax…”

“It also has two great principles?”

“Heavens, could it be that this Di Hao has fused two great principles as well?”

The surrounding spectators were all stunned.

The Nine Temples Saintess, Silver Wolf, Gu Zhenzi, and the others were all shocked.

The Light King’s staff technique contained two great principles at the same time. This was within everyone’s expectations. After all, they knew that the Light King had fused two great laws.

But Di Hao…no one had ever heard of him fusing two principles?

But this ax clearly contained the power of two different principles!

“It’s this ax!”

Thunder God and Wan Xuan looked at each other. They knew this ax. Previously, when they joined hands, they were forced back by Di Hao’s ax.

In the center of the battlefield, under everyone’s gaze, Di Hao’s ax had finally arrived.

Weng!

A terrifying might suddenly erupt from the center of the battlefield.

The surrounding heaven and earth also darkened at this moment.

The heaven and earth were covered in darkness as if they had sunk into a void of space and time.

Even the sound had completely disappeared.

In this boundless darkness, this unparalleled ax came into direct contact with the shocking staff of the Light King.

At the instant of contact, an explosive boom reverberated in the air.

The sound was deafening, causing many people’s hearts to tremble. Not long after the collision, the difference between the two forces was revealed.

The matchless ax, which contained the principles of destruction and space-time, began to crumble. The huge ax was smashed in a different direction, while Di Hao’s figure shot backward in a sorry state, he did not stop until he reached the edge of the battlefield. After he stopped, Di Hao’s face darkened, and blood trickled down from the corner of his mouth.

Apparently, his divine body had suffered a lot of damage from this collision.

“He lost!”

“Di Hao lost in the end.”

“Didn’t his ax contain the power of two principles at the same time? He also fused two principles. How could he lose?”

The surrounding spectators exclaimed in shock.

There were also many people who were puzzled. When Di Hao used that ax just now, many people subconsciously felt that he could contend against the Light King. However, they did not expect that in a head-on battle…such a huge gap appeared in an instant. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, some experts who were strong and had a high vision immediately saw through it.

“That’s not right. Although Di Hao’s ax contains two principles, it doesn’t feel like the two principles have perfectly fused together!”

“They haven’t perfectly fused together. It’s just that they complement each other. It’s still far from the true fusion of principles.”

“No matter what, for this Di Hao to be able to use such an ax is already very impressive.”

Everyone sighed.

In the center of the battlefield, the Light King laughed out loud, “Haha, Di Hao, it seems like I have to take back what I said. I thought that your strength could only be ranked third on the True Saint Ranking and was still a little far from the Nine Temples Saintess. However, that ax of yours…although it wasn’t a perfect fusion of the two laws, it could still be superimposed. To be able to do this, your strength isn’t weaker than the Nine Temples Saintess, it’s even stronger!”

“Yes!”

“Then you can be ranked third on the True Saint Ranking, just behind me and the Saint Devil’s Son!”

The Light King had clearly recognized Di Hao’s strength in front of everyone. He even thought that Di Hao could be ranked third on the True Saint Ranking, ahead of the Nine Temples Saintess. This made the Nine Temples Saintess frown slightly, but she did not refute him.

Indeed, Di Hao, who had used that ax earlier, was slightly stronger than her in terms of strength.

However, after hearing the Light King’s words…Di Hao said in a low voice, “I only managed to superimpose the two great principles. I can’t compare to you perfectly fusing the two great principles together. I didn’t intend to defeat you in the first place. I just wanted to know how much of a gap there was between us. But now, it seems that the gap is ridiculously large. If I’m not wrong, you shouldn’t have used the power of the fusion of the two great principles to the maximum, right?”

“Haha, smart. I only used about 50% of the power of the fusion of the two principles.” The Light King laughed.

Hearing this, Di Hao smiled bitterly.

The surrounding spectators were all shocked.

They did not expect that the move that the Light King used just now, which easily suppressed Di Hao’s strongest move, did not even go all out?

He had only used 50 percent of the power of the two principles?

If he had used 100 percent of the power of the two principles, how strong would he be?

Just thinking about it made them shudder.

“Well, this battle has come to an end. Now, it’s time to get down to business,” Silver Wolf’s voice suddenly sounded.

Then everyone turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

The battle between Di Hao and the Light King was just a sudden change.

However, the real purpose of the three Saint Realms’ painstaking effort to kill their way here was ultimately Jian Wushuang.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, everyone from the Temporal Temple has left except Di Hao. Now, you can die in peace,” Thunder God said coldly.

Before Di Hao and Light King fought, Qian Hongzi and the other three had already left the space-time zone. They left proudly after Gu Zhenzi opened a space passage around the golden array, Gu Zhenzi sealed the passage again, but Jian Wushuang still had no chance to escape.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you have no chance to survive in front of us. Since you are also a world-shaking genius, I’ll give you a chance to kill yourself,” Silver Wolf said.

“Kill myself?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and a strange smile appeared on his face. “Do you think you are qualified to kill me?”
