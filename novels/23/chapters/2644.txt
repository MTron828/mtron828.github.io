Chapter 2645: Crisis!

A loud twang resounded!

The tall old man’s golden stone staff had great momentum from its heavy mass and the long charging swinging period. Although Jian Wushuang’s Overlapping Shadow’s first form was extremely powerful, it was considered a Space-time Sword Technique which emphasized speed greatly and was naturally at a disadvantage from the energy perspective.

Jian Wushuang’s body sunk after the clash as an immense force was passed through his hands onto his divine body but was easily blocked by his physical protective capabilities.

“The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is truly something.”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods frowned from that simple challenge. Although the fight was three-on-one, they only gained a very slight upper hand.

“Looks like Heaven Ultimate Gods aren’t all that,” scoffed Jian Wushuang.

“What did he just say!!”

“Kill him!!”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods were incredibly angered and no longer held back and unleashed their full abilities.

Although Jian Wushuang was facing three opponents at once, he could take care of the bald young man by controlling his Transmigration Sword Formation by rearranging and disassembling it time and again with great finesse. As for the other two, he could deal with them head-to-head using his understanding of sword skills and Space-time Law.

Even though he was slightly disadvantaged during the fight, his physical protective capabilities did not allow the three Heaven Ultimate Gods to even injure him, hence they could do nothing to him.

“This kid...”

“How can we not even touch him with three Heaven Ultimate Gods working together?”

“This little Northern Darkstar Territory has such a genius?”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods were incredibly stunned and angered, but there was nothing they could do about Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang could fend off their attacks, his people were greatly disadvantaged in the remaining battlefield areas.

Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower sent out more than 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods, but Crimson Stone Fort had only a dozen of them, which was a quarter of their opponents’ force.

Every Crimson Stone Fort Heaven Ultimate God had to fight against three or four experts of the same level, how could that be possible?

Only in a short moment, the Crimson Stone Fort was almost completely defeated with one-third of their Heaven Ultimate Gods slaughtered. The rest of them were barely hanging in there and perhaps it would not be long before all of them died there.

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly. During his battle against the three Heaven Ultimate Gods, he had taken in everything that was happening on the battlefield while planning for his next step.

Crimson Stone Fort’s faction was in an absolute crisis without a doubt.

Meanwhile, his Official Army and himself at that moment were considered on the same side as Crimson Stone Fort which placed them in a really dangerous position.

Jian Wushuang thought to himself, ‘The difference between both sides is really too large, making it impossible to fight head-to-head. The most probable move right now is to break open the surrounding magic formation and escape.’

However, the Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower seemed to be well prepared with the magic formation they had set up way beforehand being extremely sturdy. Jian Wushuang could tell at a glance that it was not something Heaven Ultimate Gods could break open, and neither could himself of course.

The only person on Crimson Stone Fort’s side who might be capable of breaking the magic formation and giving them a chance to live was the Scorpion King!

However, the Scorpion King was also in a non-favorable situation.

He was then fighting against three Grand Ultimate Gods from Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower. Among the three Grand Ultimate Gods, Bai Tu and Li Qianji were considered slightly easier to deal with, but Gu Ji was incredibly overpowering and placed immense pressure on him.

The Scorpion King was already using his masterstroke Nine Asteroids. The nine gigantic asteroids appeared between heaven and earth as they lashed out under the Scorpion King’s control. Each of them had terrifying energy, but he was still badly suppressed as it was an unfair battle of three versus one after all.

“Damn! Damn it!!”

The Scorpion King shouted nonstop with his bloodshot eyes.

He could also see what was happening on the surrounding battlefield and understood the situation they were in.

“Haha, Scorpion King. You don’t have to go through all this if you just pass over the Blood Gems earlier, right? However, you just can’t help but act tough and now you can’t keep the Blood Gems on top of having to die here as well,” sneered Li Qianji.

“I still won’t let you have it easy even if I have to die!” Scorpion King shouted sternly and furiously. He flipped his giant hand and took out a foul-smelling blood-red pill while looking at it with a crazed expression in his eyes before swallowing the pill without hesitation.

The Scorpion King’s already overpowering and abnormal divine power aura shot even higher as the pill went down.

In just a split second, it had shot up to a level close to a High-level Grand Ultimate God.

“Is that...the Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill?” Gu Ji’s face turned grim.

“Haha, looks like he’s going crazy.” Li Qianji’s grin became wider.

The Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill was a kind of pill that could greatly increase one’s abilities in a short period. However, the pill’s side effects were horrifically strong such that it would greatly affect one’s foundation and cultivation. Although the Scorpion King would not die after consuming it, his cultivation would likely drop from Primary-level Grand Ultimate God to Heaven Ultimate God. It would take a very long recultivation period to return to his previous level.

Therefore, nobody would dare take the pill under normal circumstances.

However, it was apparent that the Scorpion King had no other option but to take the pill as his last resort.

Boom boom boom~~~

A terrifying aura that was twice what it previously was suddenly burst out as the Scorpion King’s face looked horrifying like a fierce beast. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The nine asteroids he was controlling immediately surged in energy and lashed out in a frenzy!

“Careful!” Gu Ji warned.

Although Bai Tu and Li Qianji’s expressions were still ridiculing the Scorpion King, they were not being careless at all and stepped backward. They dared not touch the asteroids attacking them.

Even Gu Ji had retreated under the Scorpion King’s terrifying battle strength.

The Scorpion King did not go after them after making the three retreated. He instead turned around and jumped against the grey magic formation that shrouded the entire void.

“No!”

“Does he want to destroy the Magic Formation?”

Gu Ji and the other two were shocked.

Although the Scorpion King looked insane with nothing to lose, he was extremely calm in his mind and knew that continuous fighting would cost everyone their life. Therefore, he decided to rely on the Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill’s effect to crush the Magic Formation.

“Break it open!!”

The Scorpion King hysterically commanded the nine asteroids as three of them suddenly grew bigger dramatically before crashing against the grey magic formation.
