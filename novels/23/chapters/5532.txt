Chapter 5532 ¬†Pattern Is Too Small

No one bothered with Wu Zuo.

When Wu Zuo saw the newcomer, his expression recovered slightly. Then, he sat down on his own, asking coldly, "Why are you here? To mock me?"

"I dare not mock you. I'm just here to remind you, based on our many years of brotherhood, not to offend those you shouldn't for the sake of trivial matters." Emperor Lu Hua's words were indeed well-intentioned.

At the same time, he was buying time for Jian Wushuang. In case Wu Zuo, in his impatience, decided to personally seek revenge, that would complicate matters.

However, this statement made the faces of some in the hall look unpleasant.

Especially Vice Hall Master Zhong, he was unwilling, but the other party was the Palace Master, so he couldn't refute and could only clench his fists.

As for the weaker elders, there's no need to dwell on them; their strength was inherently limited, and they had little room for improvement. It wasn't wrong to say that about them.

In no time, the Inheritors would replace them.

Now, most Inheritors had already entered the realm of Emperors. Given sufficient resources, Zhen Ling preferred to use these Inheritors.

However, it was currently a period of intense cultivation, everyone striving for power. Once progress stalled, they would go to the Elder's Palace, or the White Tiger Temple, or even the Azure Dragon Temple, to take on important roles.

Emperor Lu Hua was quite open-minded about this. The future belonged to the Inheritors, especially the strongest ones among them.

Offending these people was unwise.

Even if Wu Zuo was once a disciple of Qishen, that was in the past. Lu Hua Emperor didn't want to belittle Wu Zuo, but he knew that Wu Zuo had been expelled by Zhen Ling. Besides strength, Wu Zuo had nothing comparable to the Inheritors.

In terms of potential, Wu Zuo had been like this since ancient times. Having survived for so many years, now that he had restored his peak strength, there wasn't much difference from the past.

In this lifetime, it was estimated that things would stay the same.

Since that was the case, why not loosen up a bit and elevate one's own perspective?

"You're talking so lightly!" Wu Zuo sneered, "Jian Wushuang escaped from prison, all thanks to you. Not only did you dare to plot against me, but you also killed my sworn brother Tie San. This matter is not over!" T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

Lu Hua sighed, saying, "This is how it ends for you."

After speaking, he disappeared from view.

Wu Zuo didn't sneer inwardly. He thought, 'Let's see who laughs last!'

"Except for those in official positions, everyone else follows Vice Hall Master Zhong to the Northern Region to capture Jian Wushuang. Even if you have to dig three feet underground or reach the ninth heaven to grab the moon, you must catch him for me!"

Vice Hall Master Zhong had been waiting for this moment. The words of Lord Lu Hua displeased him. He wanted to capture Jian Wushuang just to see for himself, just how strong this Jian Wushuang really is.

"Yes!"

After receiving the order, the crowd didn't linger and went straight to the central hall.

Qiuhuang let Jian Wushuang escape, and with Jian Wushuang captured, others naturally rose to take his place.

After all the arrangements were made, only Wu Zuo remained in the hall.

With no outsiders present, Wu Zuo finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Sitting on the throne, he began to plan how to explain things to Zhen Ling.

He hadn't told Zhen Ling about the matter of the Origin Source of All Things. He feared that Zhen Ling might suddenly make a move on the giant egg within the Origin Source of All Things.

If that happened, the plan would be ruined, and his position as the Palace Master would be at risk.

Swish!

After contemplating for a long time, Wu Zuo directly set off for the Sea of the Universe.

"Master!"

Wu Zuo respectfully stood outside the pavilion.

Zhen Ling glanced at him and said calmly, "Has the plan started?"

"Very smoothly. Jian Wushuang has already reached the Northern Region. I believe it won't be long before someone takes the bait!" Wu Zuo replied.

Zhen Ling nodded, "Good, with the success of this plan, the position of the Elder Palace will be yours."

"I'm sure you cursed me a lot when I removed your title in the past. The Elder Palace was originally meant for you, but you lacked significant achievements and influence. It wouldn't be wise for you to ascend to the position hastily!"

After hearing this, Wu Zuo immediately knelt down, saying with sincere fear, "I dare not. Everything was a test from Master, and I am grateful for it!"

"Hehe, you know how to talk," Zhen Ling laughed. "There's nothing else. You can leave now, but there are some matters you need to personally follow up on without any mistakes!"

Wu Zuo affirmed, "Yes!"

The entire Elder Palace!

The joy overwhelmed him, making him momentarily forget what he came here for.

The giant egg within the Origin Source of All Things.

Wu Zuo swallowed nervously.

It had been so many years without any issues. Hopefully, nothing would go wrong at this critical juncture!

Originally, Wu Zuo had planned to inform Zhen Ling about this matter and then discuss the situation with him in the context of the current overall situation.

However, in the grip of the overwhelming joy, Wu Zuo, with his judgment clouded, decided to keep this matter secret for now.

He intended to wait until after capturing Fuego, then reveal the truth to Zhen Ling. At that time, it would be a double joy.

If he spoke now, it not only would affect the plan, but Zhen Ling might also blame him for not mentioning it earlier.

The Elder's Palace, which was about to change hands, would be lost in the blink of an eye.

Zhen Ling also sensed that Wuzuo seemed to have something on his mind, but he didn't bring it up. In his view, Wuzuo's scope of concern wasn't likely something significant, so he chose not to inquire.

With joy in his heart, Wu zuo left the Sea of the Universe directly.

Soon after, a shocking piece of news spread.

"Jian Wushuang has betrayed and been stripped of the heir's status!"

Others may not be aware, but Shen Ling who were paying attention to all of this knew that Wu Zuo had gone to the Sea of the Universe to consult with Zhen Ling.

After meeting with Zhen Ling, he announced this news, signifying that Zhen Ling had given up on Jian Wushuang.

For a moment, countless individuals were shaken!

Stripped of the heir's status!

Jian Wushuang's life was probably over.

Unless he became the Universe Master, he would be hunted relentlessly.

Under the pursuit of countless powerhouses, even with outstanding talent, simply maintaining a stable path in cultivation would be a challenge, let alone dreaming of becoming the Universe Master.

After the command was issued, the entire Northern Region fell into chaos.

Countless people set out in search of Jian Wushuang.

The indigenous Emperors, who were previously hesitant, now felt completely assured and prepared to make a big move.

Many peak-level tier 6 Emperors had already mobilized.

Even in the Elder Palace and the tier 6 Emperors from other halls, all were on the move.

All headed towards Jian Wushuang.

10,000 cubic universal crystals!

Who wouldn't be tempted?

Even the supreme-peak experts couldn't help but feel moved.

In the Elder Palace, there was a commotion.

On the Grave God Mountain, shock set in!

Jian Wushuang was the first Inheritor who was taken away by a strong force without completing the trial.

Now, he was the first Inheritor to be deprived of his status.

Not a single thing seemed to be going smoothly.

The only significant event was the incident at the Beiwang Tower, but that had only happened a few days ago.

News spread quickly, causing a storm in the city in just a month.

And at this moment, Jian Wushuang found himself in a city on a rainy night.

The Northern Region, Giant Gate City.

This place didn't belong to any state but was a super city managing independently outside.
