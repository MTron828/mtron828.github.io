“The nineteenth floor?” The elegant elderly looked shocked.

There was a total of thirty floors in Illusionary Mind Sea. From the twentieth floor onwards, only consciousness strength at a Real God’s level could pass through. However, as he had passed through the nineteenth floor, it meant that his consciousness strength was at the peak of a Universe God’s.

If the person who had passed the nineteenth floor was a disciple who was a Universe God in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star, the elegant elderly wouldn’t have been surprised.

However, Jian Wushuang was obviously just a Universe God in the Second Heaven according to his aura.

“A Universe God in the Second Heaven passed through the nineteenth floor?”

“Such a terrifying consciousness!”

The elegant elderly complimented in silence, “It’s been a while since there was a person with impressive consciousness like this young man in Lineage of Star. I have to report to Hall Master Yuan immediately.”

The elegant elderly immediately sent a message to Hall Master Yuan.

Hall Master Yuan, who received the message, showed an interested expression, “Jian Wushuang. Although he is an inverse cultivator, he is merely a Universe God in the First Heaven. His Soul Power strength has reached such a level. Tsk tsk, it seems that the battle to fight to be a disciple of Star Palace will be very interesting.”

…

Lineage of Star, the battle to be a disciple of Star Palace that happens every five thousand years is finally here.

On that day, the entire Lineage of Star was boiling with excitement.

In the middle of the boundless Milky Way, there was a floating star. The star was named Titanic Star.

Although Titanic Star was said to be a star, it was actually an empty land that was floating. The land was the battle ring itself.

At that very moment, a large number of spectators from Lineage of Star surrounded Titanic Star. The crowd was crazily huge.

These people were made of higher-ups in Lineage Star, disciples who were Universe Gods in the First to Third Heaven. At the same time, there were maids and servants who had gathered there too. No one wanted to miss the battle that happened every five thousand years.

Jian Wushuang also appeared at the border of Titanic Star.

Once he had appeared, he could feel a few burning gazes. Jian Wushuang looked and he suddenly understood.

The few owners of those burning gazes were all ordinary disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven and they hoped to fight for the quota to be a disciple of Star Palace during this battle. Among them, the one who had the best chance was Luo Quan.

“They are eyeing me. I guess they are dying to get my quota to be a disciple of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, then he closed his eyes.

After all of the disciples gathered around Titanic Stars.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A dozen figures descended simultaneously. The one leading was, of course, Hall Master Yuan. The one next to Hall Master Yuan was Lei Chao. They were followed by a dozen deacon elderlies.

“It’s about time. Let’s begin. Begin from Universe Gods in the First Heaven,” Hall Master Yuan ordered.

The disciples who were Universe Gods in the First Heaven in Lineage of Star then appeared on Titanic Star. There were a total of about forty people.

“There are quite a number of them,” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and took a look at the Titanic Star.

“Jian Wushuang, you were supposed to be among these people,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

In terms of realm, he was merely a Universe God in the First Heaven. It wasn’t because he wanted to hide his identity as an inverse cultivator, he was really supposed to join the battle as a Universe God in the First Heaven. It was a pity that inverse cultivation was a piece of important news and it couldn’t be exposed easily. Hence, Jian Wushuang could only pretend to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven.

Naturally, he had to join the battle among Universe God in the Second Heaven.

After those disciples who were Universe Gods in the First Heaven appeared on Titanic Star, there was immediately a space wormhole which popped up. Then, Hall Master Yuan spoke, “Just like the battle five thousand years ago, the rotation battle is carried out in two rounds. In the first round, everyone takes turn to challenge in the Supreme Tower. Depending on your performance in the Supreme Tower, the deacon elderlies and I will watch. We will then pick the top ten to participate in the second round of the rotation battle after everyone has passed through the Supreme Tower. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Let’s begin!”

The rules of the battle were the same as before. The disciples understood and they didn’t have any questions.

Very quickly, Universe Gods in the First Heaven passed through the wormhole, one after another, to enter the Supreme Tower.

The process took over an hour as there were forty geniuses who had to go through the Supreme Tower one by one.

After that, Hall Master Yuan announced the result straightway.

“Duan Tianhong, Yu Jiang, Qiu Yu…” Hall Master Yuan read ten names, “The ten of you can proceed to the second round of rotation battle!”

Once the result was announced, those whose name was read were delighted while those whose name weren’t read were disappointed.

“The ten of you are the top ten who stayed in the Supreme Tower for the longest,” Jian Wushuang watched the scene calmly.

He knew that although it was decided by Hall Master Yuan and those deacon elderlies, in a normal situation, the duration that one stayed in the Supreme Tower would reveal the result.

Of course, it was not definite.

The rotation battle’s rules were even simpler.

The ten geniuses fought one on one. Everyone would fight a battle with another person. In other words, everyone would fight nine battles and the ranking would be decided according to the winning and losing of the battles. The first five would be disciples of Star Palace. Every battle would be entitled to extra grants. The higher the ranking, the more one received.

The rotation battle began and the ten geniuses took turns to fight with the other nine disciples.

As the rotation battles were carried out on Titanic Star, the surrounding spectators were naturally noisier than the first round which was carried out in the Supreme Tower.

Especially when the fight was between two geniuses that were evenly matched. The crowd would cheer when the fight was ferocious.

Jian Wushuang watched the rotation battle calmly.

In his body, King of Venomous Worms laughed creepily, “Jian Wushuang, are you upset? Do you feel aggravated? If you were to join the battle as a Universe God in the First Heaven, there would be no suspense and you could easily win. But now, hehe, you can only watch.”

“Even if I join the battle as a Universe God in the Second Heaven, it doesn’t mean that I can’t win. What’s there to be upset about?” Jian Wushuang didn’t care.

“It’s great that you have such an attitude. You must aim high. To fight with these Universe Gods in the First Heaven, you wouldn’t feel pressure at all. If you were to win the first place among Universe God in the Second Heaven when you are only a Universe God in the First Heaven, that’s truly impressive!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“First?” Jian Wushuang contracted his pupils but didn’t say much.

The battle speed among Universe Gods in the First Heaven was rather fast. In two hours, the ten Universe Gods in the First Heaven had completed nine fights each.
