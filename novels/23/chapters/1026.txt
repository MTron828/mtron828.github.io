Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Where is Jian Wushuang?”

Empyrean Patriarch’s voice sounded extremely cold.

Neither did he care God Hong nor the Rock Demon Clan. He only had Jian Wushuang in his mind.

Hearing his words, God Hong quivered with fear. But he still answered, “Jian Wushuang left here a few days ago.”

“Where did he go?” Empyrean Patriarch stared at God Hong.

“I don’t know.” God Hong shook his head.

“You don’t know?” Empyrean Patriarch said with a rather cold voice. All of a sudden, a terrifying pressure swept toward God Hong.

Although God Hong was a Rank Three Dao Master who possessed the bloodline of the Rock Demon Giant and formidable defense capability, he was suppressed by this pressure.

“Pfft!”

He directly spat a mouthful of blood and his internal injuries, which had not been completely recovered, were again aggravated. However, he had no time to attend this matter and wipe the blood from his mouth. He said hurriedly, “Empyrean Patriarch, I really don’t know where he went.”

“Really?” Empyrean Patriarch didn’t ask any more, but his cold eyes looked at the habitat of the Rock Demon Clan below.

“My son died here. This is his burial place!”

“Thus, there can be no living creatures within a radius of 10,000 miles. Millions of your clansmen must die and be buried with him!”

Empyrean Patriarch said in a mild tone, which, unexpectedly, contained overwhelming killing intent.

The two simple sentences sentenced the entire Rock Demon Clan to death.

After they heard that, the expressions of the 10 Protectors behind Empyrean Patriarch turned grim. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They all relished slaughtering and had slain a lot of people on the Samsara Continent. The reason why they sought refuge with Empyrean Patriarch was that they were pursued by some powerful populations and experts from the Samsara Continent. They had no other choice.

Hearing that Empyrean Patriarch was going to exterminate the Rock Demon Clan, they all got excited.

Nevertheless, the expressions of God Hong and other experts from this clan changed sharply.

“Empyrean Patriarch, there is a special place in our clan and I wish you can follow me and have a look at it.” Suddenly, God Hong said seriously.

“Oh?” Empyrean Patriarch’s expression slightly altered.

At a critical moment when he planned to wipe out the Rock Demon Clan, God Hong said he wanted to take him to another place.

Did he think that place could change his decision?

“Empyrean Patriarch, please follow me.” God Hong managed to restrain his fear and led Empyrean Patriarch into the territory of his clan.

With a mighty strength, Empyrean Patriarch feared nothing. He followed God Hong and arrived at the valley where Jian Wushuang had meditated earlier after a short while.

“Empyrean Patriarch, look at there.” God Hong pointed at the cliff dotted with sword scars.

Empyrean Patriarch’s eyes swept across the cliff and he noticed the nine sword scars on it with a glance.

Then he started to look through them. When he saw the first sword scar, a trace of disdain flashed past his eyes.

And when he glanced over the second sword scar, he was still unimpressed with it.

However, a little bit of surprise flashed past his eyes as he observed the third sword scar.

When he scanned the fourth, fifth, and sixth sword scars, his face gradually grew solemn.

And when he fixed his eyes on the seventh sword scar, a hint of horror could be seen in his eyes.

The moment his eyes swept across the ninth sword scar, his heart knocked and eyes popped.

“What a terrifying sword!”

He was a man of powerful strength and had experienced a lot. Therefore, he was very clear about the horror of the sword that left the ninth sword scar.

That sword was so fast that no one in this world could block its attack, including him.

“Although there are numerous experts who study Sword Principle in the entire Green Fire World, only one is qualified to display such a horrible swordsmanship!”

“The first Sword Cultivator, Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

His eyes flickered with cold light.

“Empyrean Patriarch, I assume you have recognized the owner of the sword scars.” God Hong said.

“So what?” Empyrean Patriarch replied in a deep voice.

“Nothing. I just want you to know that my clan is on friendly terms with the legendary Sunrise Sword Emperor. 20,000 years ago, he passed by and happened to gain insight into Sword Principle. As a result, he stayed here and meditated in this valley for two years. We have provided him everything we could during this period.”

“When he left, he deliberately left these sword scars in our clan.” God Hong said calmly, “Jian Wushuang is a Sword Cultivator and he stayed here due to the sword scars. Just at this moment, Di Yan and the Black Python Clan invaded here and disturbed him. He then acted and killed them. He did all this for his sake.”

“He knew he killed your son and provoked you. Hence, he left directly regardless of our safety.”

“You mean your clan has nothing to do with this matter?” Empyrean Patriarch cast a cold glance at God Hong.

“Since Di Yan died on our territory, we cannot shrink from the responsibility. I just want to tell you that we are kind of close to Sunrise Sword Emperor but not familiar with Jian Wushuang. His only purpose of staying here is to study the sword scars.” God Hong added.

Upon hearing this, Empyrean Patriarch narrowed his eyes.

He was far from a fool and naturally would not blindly believe what God Hong had said. Given his character, even if God Hong disowned Jian Wushuang, he would exterminate the Rock Demon Clan without hesitation.

The reason why he didn’t take action was that he feared Sunrise Sword Emperor immensely!

The sword scars in this valley were definitely left by Sunrise Sword Emperor. He could tell that they actually had existed for 20,000 years from their appearances. The Rock Demon Clan, however, had been living here over the past hundreds of thousands of years. God Hong did tell the truth.

In other words, the Rock Demon Clan did have friendly relations with Sunrise Sword Emperor. This meant he must look before he leapt.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

His mind quivered with fear at this name.

There were very few people in the entire Green Fire World that could cause him to fear.

But Sunrise Sword Emperor was definitely the one who was able to do so!
