Chapter 1372: Battle

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On Sword Star, Jian Wushuang watched Luo Quan and the others leave with no facial expression.

“Luo Quan is really strong!”

“I performed the Blood Night technique with my all and I erupted my Soul Attack entirely. Theoretically, even an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven would find it difficult to resist. However, he encountered my Soul Attack directly and wasn’t affected at all!”

“His consciousness is very strong and he is much stronger in power than me!”

Jian Wushuang complimented him but he was looking at Qiu Yue next to him.

Qiu Yue looked strange.

“Why? Are you disappointed in my power?” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“No. I believe that you becoming the disciple of Lineage of Star definitely meant that you are unusually capable. Even if you aren’t Luo Quan’s match now, you could definitely catch up in no time,” Qiu Yue said.

Jian Wushuang smiled when he heard that, but his pupils contracted.

He didn’t care about victory or defeat.

Even if he lost to Luo Quan, he wouldn’t be bothered. His power was weaker compared to the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven after all.

However, such weakness wouldn’t persist.

“Qiu Yue, when Luo Quan left earlier, he mentioned something about the battle between disciples of Star Palace. What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That’s a battle aiming to fight for the right to become a disciple of Star Palace. In Lineage of Star, it will be conducted every five thousand years,” Qiu Yue said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked.

“Mister, you just came to Lineage of Star. There are many things that you have yet to know. In Lineage of Star, it has always been power defines one’s position,” Qiu Yue explained.

“Under normal circumstances, the disciples of Star Palace have always had fifteen slots. Among them, five are Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, five are Universe God in the Second Heaven and five are Universe Gods in the First Heaven!”

“In other words, they selected top five strongest Universe Gods in each Heaven to join Star Palace. The selection method is conducted through a battle between disciples in Star Palace that is held every five thousand years in Lineage of Star. In the battle, the five strongest will become disciples of Star Palace while the rest will be ordinary disciples!”

“Is that so?”

Jian Wushuang understood then, “In other words, although I am a disciple of Star Palace now, if I fail to be in the top five strongest among Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in the battle eight hundred years later, I will be degraded as an ordinary disciple?”

“Yes,” Qiu Yue nodded.

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows and he immediately felt pressure from the bottom of his heart.

In Lineage of Star, there was a huge difference between the disciples of Star Palace and ordinary disciples.

Especially considering that Real God Hall, Scripture Depository, Reset Palace, the three main cultivation resource were only occupied by disciples of Star Palace.

Jian Wushuang, of course, wanted to maintain his position as a disciple of Star Palace. However, with his ability then, he was at the bottom of the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven within Lineage of Star.

“I only have eight hundred years!” Jian Wushuang held his fists tight and his eyes were twinkling with energy.

Eight hundred years wasn’t short to him.

With eight hundred years’ time, with the aid of cultivation resources in Lineage of Star, he might stand a chance.

“Mister, you lost to Luo Quan today before the other few disciples. If I’m not mistaken, they definitely will spread the word. By then, I’m afraid it would trigger the suspicion and dissatisfaction of many other disciples. There might be other disciples who come to challenge you. You must be mentally prepared.” Qiu Yue reminded.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “My current power is too weak. I have to admit. Whether or not they suspect me, has nothing to do with me. If they want to challenge me, by all means, come. There is no difference between losing one battle and a hundred battles anyway.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t care. On the contrary, he hoped that the disciples in Lineage of Star would look for him.

Jian Wushuang treated the fights with the geniuses as a kind of training.

Plus, he had already lost to Luo Quan. So what if he were to lose to other ordinary disciples?

He didn’t care about victory or defeat. The only thing that he cared about was his strength and the result of the battle that would happen eight hundred years later.

…

Just as Qiu Yue has predicted, the news about Jian Wushuang being defeated by Luo Quan spread like wildfire in Lineage of Star.

At the same time, the mirror image of their battle was spread across Lineage of Star too. On top of that, the image of Jian Wushuang trying to catch a Meta beast in the Milky Way was spread along too.

The moment the images spread, it suddenly stirred a commotion in the entire Lineage of Star.

The disciples in Lineage of Star were all astonished.

They were shocked at the fact that Jian Wushuang was defeated by Luo Quan.

There were many geniuses in Lineage of Star after all. It was normal that an ordinary disciple win against disciples in Star Palace occasionally. Plus, Jian Wushuang just got to the Lineage of Star and he had yet to cultivate while utilizing the resource in Lineage of Star. It was nothing if his power wasn’t ahead of Luo Quan.

What shocked the disciples was that the power that Jian Wushuang revealed was… Really too weak!

“Weak!”

“How could he be so weak?”

“He can’t even do anything to a three-meter tall Meta beast and he is a disciple of Star Palace?”

“I heard that he couldn’t even pass through the first floor of Star Tower. Is this a joke?”

“Universe God in the Second Heaven with only this level of power, there are so many in Purple Moon Sanctuary. What is Hall Master Yuan thinking? How could they let such a person become a disciple of Star Palace?”

These disciples couldn’t understand how Jian Wushuang, with such a weak power, had become a disciple of Star Palace.

As they couldn’t understand, it naturally became dissatisfaction towards the higher ups of Lineage of Star.

“Unfair!”

“I put in so much effort but I could only maintain my position as an ordinary disciple. But Jian Wushuang is a disciple of Star Palace with only such power?”

“Would Jian Wushuang be one of the Hall Master’s illegitimate children or is he related to the Palace Master by any chance? Otherwise, why would the higher ups of Lineage of Star take such a good care of him?”

Lineage of Star was filled with dissatisfaction and complaints. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The disciples of Star Palace was definitely an existence that countless ordinary disciples in Lineage of Star envied.

The three most precious cultivation resources in Lineage of Star had always been the special privilege that disciples of Star Palace possessed while ordinary disciples stood almost no hope at all.

All this while, the ordinary disciples fought for a chance to become a disciple of Star Palace. Those who were lucky enough to become disciples of Star Palace relied on their power and proved themselves to become one. Hence, these ordinary disciples could only accept them.

However, the ordinary disciples were then unhappy with the appearance of Jian Wushuang and the power that he revealed. The ordinary disciples complained that Lineage of Star was unfair and that the higher ups were biased!
