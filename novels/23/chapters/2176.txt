Chapter 2177 Blood Emperor

Leng Ruxue stood silently at the edge of the battlefield.

She had yet to make her move since the battle had begun.

After Kaiser Blood slayed Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su, he was heading for her. Leng Ruxue’s face darkened but showed no sign of retreat.

Xiu!

Kaiser Blood appeared in front of Leng Ruxue, his crimson eyes staring straight through her.

“You intend to take me as well, Lord Kaiser Blood?” Leng Ruxue’s voice was indifferent as she raised her head.

As she raised her head, a special mark appeared between her brows. Her pupils turned white, with no trace of blood. Her long black hair turned white in an instant, swaying with the wind.

She gave off an unprecedentedly destructive aura.

The aura was so strong even Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai from afar could not help but be startled by it.

“This is…?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

It was the first time he had seen Leng Ruxue in that form.

White-haired, grey-eyed, the power to destroy heavens! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The unique situation was scarier than when Leng Rushuang took over that body and released the sins of its past life.

Kaiser Blood twitched at the sight of Leng Ruxue’s grey pupils. Fear could be seen in Kaiser Blood for the first time.

“The Heavenly Body is indeed a quality worthy of both envy and detest. Rest assured, I will not attack you for the sake of your backing. I do not have a death wish, and I have enough Opposing Blood Qi for my Opposing Blood Formation anyway,” Kaiser Blood smiled lightly. One could not tell if he was telling the truth or not.

Leng Ruxue gave a cold glance to Kaiser Blood and said nothing.

“Girl, step aside. I am unable to guarantee your safety if you happen to be within my area of attack,” Kaiser Blood.

Leng Ruxue waved her robe, and just like that her devastating aura was nowhre to be sensed. She was now in a further Void, with no intention of meddling in the upcoming formation.

Kaiser Blood turned around and looked towards Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang.

“After years of thoughtful planning, have I finally reached the last step?” Kaiser Blood murmured, but did not conceal his thoughts.

Hearing that, Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang’s faces darkened.

They knew that the Three Emperors World had spent years preparing. The war had been ignited upon discovery of it by the Eternal Chaotic World.

The battle had already sacrificed all the experts under him, even killing his own comrades. He had to have a motive.

Was the motive finally about to be revealed?

“My body no longer serves its purpose at this stage. Let me show you the real me,” Kaiser Blood chuckled as his body turned increasingly transparent, turning into nothingness.

The Eternal Chaotic World experts were all shocked.

“Disappeared?”

“Kaiser Blood’s gone?”

“What’s happening?”

Everyone was confused.

Yet at that moment, boom!

The earth trembled fiercely, leading to a huge fissure in the already horrendous ground.

The fissure seemed to be ripped open by hand and widened at an alarming rate.

Instantly, it became a huge gully.

Below the gully, a terrifying aura was gradually awakening.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai’s faces changed.

Even they could feel how terrifying the aura was.

Soon, a figure stepped out of the gully and emerged above the Void.

“I am restored!”

“After so many years, finally!”

“Hahaha~~”

His frenzied laughter was like rolling thunder.

The laughter contained an endless violent aura. That alone made countless Eternal Chaotic World experts tremble from within.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai had their eyes dead on Lord Fen.

He was three metres long and had scarlet skin all over like a human-shaped blood figure.

The blood-human had well-defined muscles and was exuding endless violent aura.

He had a human skull, but with unique black tattoos all over him.

He looked extremely terrifying.

“The tattoos, the figure… it’s a Blood Clan expert!” Emperor Bai’s pupils narrowed.

“Blood Clan?” Jian Wushuang asked.

By that moment, Jian Wushuang had already learnt quite a bit regarding the Ancient events.

The Ancient Era had countless experts.

Like Seven Star Black Sect. He was a superpower of his time.

Seven Star Black Sect’s status in the Ancient Era is equivalent to Ancient God Clan amongst the special tribes.

But there were many other forces to be reckoned with other than Seven Star Black Sect.

For example, the Three Big Holy Lands, Four Big Holy Tribes and Eight Big Holy Sects that collaborated to attack Seven Star Black Sect were impressive forces as well.

Jian Wushuang had heard of the Blood Clan from Jian Yi.

It was part of the Four Big Holy Tribes, alongside the Ancient Clan.

They had crowned the Four Big Holy Tribes for their unique and horrifying Bloodline Power.

Jian Wushuang himself understood how strong Bloodline Power could be, but he had only inherited the bloodline – there were many skills he could not perform.

But even relying solely on the power generated by the Bloodline Power, he had seen a great improvement in his powers.

In front of Jian Wushuang was the real deal – a Blood Clan expert!

“You are Kaiser Blood?” Emperor Bai stared at the Blood Clan expert.

The Blood Clan expert calmed himself down and glared at Emperor Bai. “Kaiser Blood? No. I am the Blood Emperor, ruler of the Blood Clan. Kaiser Blood was simply a figment of my consciousness.”

“Consciousness embodiment?”

“Indeed it is,” Emperor Bai mumbled, but he was not surprised.
