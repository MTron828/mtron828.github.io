Chapter 2120 Incoming Enemy!

jian wushuang’s understanding of the reincarnation doctrine reached the eighth level within the doctrine palace but did not achieve any break through.

even though he did not focus on the reincarnation doctrine with these conditions, he still managed to achieve a breakthrough and his understanding reached the ninth level of the doctrine palace within just three days.

even though he was a genius, the main reason for this was because the purple exotic beast had helped him far too much.

“continue.”

jian wushuang closed his eyes and continued mediating.

in the blink of an eye, jian wushuang and the group of emperor gods had been in the palace for half a month.

within this half a month, it was very peaceful.

this peace was about to be broken.

in ancient mystery land, which was a distance away from the heaven repairing palace, there was a plot of ordinary land. even if one used their soul power to scan, they could not sense anything. in reality, within the depths of this land, there was a hidden formation.

at this point in time, the formation was running. it caused the entire land to tremble lightly.

within moments, peace returned. however, figures appeared on the formation.

there were around thirty people in black cloaks.

the leader was a well built man whose skin color was bronze and was over two meters tall. his aura was far stronger than everyone else’s.

if jian wushuang was here, he would be able to recognize him immediately.

this man had fought with jian wushuang before. it was the stage three great emperor, demon king chen yu!!!

six other men in black cloaks reached the realm of great emperor and had a terrifying aura. the remaining people were all emperor gods.

this was probably the strongest line up acheron palace had: six great emperors and twenty emperor gods led by a stage-three great emperor, demon king chen yu.

their target was heaven repairing palace!

“back then i set this formation in the ancient mystery land as a precautionary measure. never did i think i would actually use it” demon king chen yu smiled devilishly.

at every entrance to the ancient mystery land were experts from the sanctuary alliance standing guard. it was further reinforced with secret restrictions. it was impossible to sneak past undetected. furthermore, if the ancient mystery land was still sealed, this formation would not work as well.

“because of the exposure of zi xu and vientiane tower, i lost face in front of kaiser blood and lord fen. this time, i will do it personally as i cannot allow for any mishaps. i will not be able to have my influence in holocaust sect or three emperors world anymore,” demon king chen yu roared quietly.

“yes.” the experts from acheron palace nodded their heads and answered in unison. their vision turned cold.

“move out!”

demon king chen yu waved his hands as the thirty or so experts flew towards heaven repairing palace.

heaven repairing palace looked like an ordinary palace. even though the door was wide open, no one could enter as the twelve seats had all been filled.

before the palace was opened, sanctuary alliance had sent over twenty almighty over to guard it. the two leaders were the abysmal saint master and east royal emperor.

“abysmal saint master, how many do you think can break through to the level of great emperor?”

east royal emperor chatted casually with the abysmal saint master.

“no idea. when we were still clueless about the palace the previous time it was opened, we didn’t choose the candidates carefully and yet coloured gaze and jiu qiao made it into the realm of great emperor. this time, we spent so much effort choosing the candidates, the chances should be much better!”

“there should at least be three, even four if we are lucky.”

“three or four? among the twelve who entered, underworld god is the strongest. it is sure that he will make it into the realm of great emperors. emperor god tian ling from soaring heaven king palace is weaker to only to the underworld god. he is also very talented and has a high chance of making it through. as for the remaining, it depends on their luck.”

“that is true. but no matter what, jian wushuang will not make it,” abysmal saint master said.

“is that not obvious?” east royal emperor smiled.

jian wushuang was an inverse cultivator. how could he break through so easily?

when they were having a casual chitchat…

hum!

in the space far away, a black cloud appeared.

this cloud started becoming bigger as it approached the palace at a very fast speed.

“that is…”

the abysmal saint master and the east royal emperor was aware of the approaching ‘black cloud.

they saw the true identity of the ‘black cloud’ when used their soul power to scan it.

it was a group of experts in black cloaks.

these experts appeared instantaneously in front of them .

terrifying aura swept towards the heaven repairing palace.

“oh no!!!”

“they are from acheron palace!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

abysmal saint master’s and east royal emperor’s faces turned pale.

“damn it! how did the people from acheron palace came into the ancient mystery land? aren’t the entrances guarded by people and secret restrictions? even if they forced their way through, there should have been a heads-up for us?” the abysmal sain master yelled.

he realised that these experts from acheron palace did not enter via the entrance.

they must have came from other routes.

without giving them any more time to think, the experts in black cloaks approached them.

“humph!”

the abysmal saint master snorted as he turned into darkness.

the darkness turned into a large, dark vortex. a monstrous black beast charged out from within the vortex.
