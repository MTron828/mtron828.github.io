Chapter 3997: Drifting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang bid farewell to his family and friends one by one. He and Leng Rushuang left their consciousness incarnations at the same time. Then, they left the Divine Beginning Realm together.

After leaving the Divine Beginning Realm, they did not leave this star field to explore the universe. Instead, they went to the three battlefields.

First, they went to the Red Cloud World to say goodbye to Lord Wu. Then, they went to the special space in Devil Smoke Valley.

In that special space, Jian Wushuang met Wind Devil again.

Wind Devil was embarrassed when he found out that Jian Wushuang had swallowed the spiritual treasure pill and knew that he had lied to him on purpose.

Knowing that Jian Wushuang was going to explore the universe, Wind Devil only gave Jian Wushuang four words, “Be careful.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After saying goodbye to Wind Devil, Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang finally started to move.

At the edge of the star field, in the vast universe void, there was no light at all.

A huge universe boat was rapidly moving through the universe void.

This universe boat was obtained from Devil Cloud Star Master. It was an extremely complete universe boat. When it moved through the universe void, its speed was much faster than that of a ruler-level cultivator.

In the universe boat, Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang sat side by side. Behind them stood a guard.

This guard was Devil Flame.

In order to kill Devil Cloud Star Master, Devil Flame used its strongest killing move at all costs. The 20% gold-swallowing divine body that he had painstakingly condensed collapsed once again. However, after Jian Wushuang killed Star Demon Ancestor…at the same time, he also obtained all the treasures of Devil Cloud Star Master. After that, he went to the nine Emperor Pavilion to exchange for a lot of treasures to restore Devil Flame’s divine body.

The reason why Jian Wushuang went to the nine Emperor Pavilion to exchange for the special gems was that he had to send them over within 500 years.

However, there was no need to rush this time, so the price was much higher. Over the years, the Devil Flame had used the special gems to restore its divine body. Now, it had recovered 20% of its divine body, it would take some time for him to recover 30% of his divine body. Most importantly, Jian Wushuang’s current wealth was not enough for him to recover 30% of his divine body.

However, even though he had only recovered 20% of his divine body and Devil Flame was only at the peak of the third-level ruler realm, his battle strength was undoubtedly at the fourth-level. On this trip to the universe, Jian Wushuang brought Devil Flame along with him, except for his wife.

“Shuang ‘er, we’re about to leave this star field. Are you ready to explore the universe with me?” Jian Wushuang glanced at his wife.

“Of course.” Leng Rushuang nodded with a smile.

“Well, let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang laughed. Under his guidance, the universe boat immediately burst into terrifying speed and passed through the universe void in front of them. It had already left the star field, it sailed toward the vast universe void.

From this day on, Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang truly began to wander and explore the universe.

The most difficult thing about wandering in the universe void was boredom.

Jian Wushuang was fine. He did not need to rely on his own leg strength to travel. He rode on the universe boat directly. Moreover, his wife had been accompanying him on the universe boat, so he could still endure it.

However, in the vast universe, most of the cultivators had just left their hometown and drifted in the universe void. It was boundless darkness. This drifting usually lasted for tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years, some cultivators could even drift in the universe for hundreds of thousands of years without meeting other cultivators. Such lonely and boring days were really difficult to endure.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had been driving the universe boat and traveling in the universe void for 3,000 years.

In the universe boat.

“Fortunately, we didn’t let Qing ‘er, Xuan ‘er, and the others come with us. Otherwise, with their temperament, they would have been unable to endure wandering in the universe for thousands of years,” Leng Rushuang said with a smile.

“Although they have been born for almost 40,000 years, they haven’t experienced as much as us. Since they were born, everything has been smooth sailing. We have always been by their side. Under such circumstances, if we let them wander in the universe void, haha…” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

During the 3,000 years that he and Leng Rushuang had spent wandering in the universe void, they had never felt lonely or tormented.

“Master, according to the star map, we are about to arrive at the Purple Micro Star Field,” Devil Flame suddenly said.

“The Purple Micro Star Field?”Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Galaxies only appeared in the dark void of the universe. They were usually extremely vast and connected to different star fields.

Jian Wushuang had read the star map in detail and knew that they would have to pass through the Purple Micro Star Field to go to the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. Although the Purple Micro Star Field was connected to a large number of star fields, there was only one medium-sized star field, it was the Purple Micro Star Field. It was because of this that the galaxy was named Purple Micro.

“Before we go to the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field, we have to go to the Purple Micro Star Field. The Purple Micro Star Field is at the end of the Purple Micro Star Field. If we want to go there, we have to go through the Purple Micro Star Field completely. The process will probably take more than a thousand years,” Jian Wushuang said.

The universe was too vast. Even if they took the universe boat and traveled much faster than ordinary cultivators, they still needed a lot of time to travel. 1,000 years was considered a relatively short time.

As Jian Wushuang was talking, the universe boat arrived at the edge of the vast Purple Micro Star Field.

“That’s the galaxy?”

Jian Wushuang was still sitting in the universe boat, but he could see the vast galaxy in front of him through the universe boat.

The galaxy was colorful and emitted dazzling light. It was gorgeous and dazzling in the universe void.

“It’s so beautiful,” Leng Rushuang could not help saying.

“Yes, it’s beautiful, but there are many dangers in the galaxy,” Jian Wushuang said.

He looked carefully at the star chart and some information given by the Dark Cloud Lord, which mentioned the dangers in the galaxy.

In the vast universe, the endless dark void of the universe was actually extremely safe, because the entire dark void of the universe was really too big, and there was not a single ray of light to be seen. Although countless cultivators had left their hometowns, it was very difficult to meet other cultivators after wandering in the universe dark void.

For example, Jian Wushuang and the others had drifted here from their hometowns. They relied on the universe boat to travel through the universe dark void for 3,000 years. Although they passed by many star fields, they did not meet any cultivators.

But the universe galaxy was completely different.
