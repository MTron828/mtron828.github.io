Chapter 104: Supreme Gold Core Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Back at the manor, Wang Yuan directly took out some wine.

“Icy Nectar?” There was a sparkle in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. “You seldom drink it.”

“Haha, but we are happy today, so drink whatever you can,” Wang Yuan said in a generous tone. “It’s a pity that Zaixuan isn’t here, otherwise, we would enjoy ourselves even more today.”

Jian Wushuang silently laughed, but suddenly his expression changed as a look of surprise flashed in his eyes.

“Yuan, Rou, I’m afraid that I’ll have to drink the wine with you a little later,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What’s wrong?” Wang Yuan looked at him quizzically.

“I feel that I will have a breakthrough soon,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Breakthrough?” Wang Yuan immediately asked with his eyes wide-open.

“Breakthrough the Gold Core?” Su Rou immediately looked at him as well and asked.

Jian Wushuang just winked at them.

In the room, Jian Wushuang was sitting on the couch with his legs crossed and had a deep sparkle in his eyes.

The Bottleneck-breaking Pill is worth 5,000 points. Even though I did not get the chance of a breakthrough after I swallowed the first pill, I got it within one day after I swallowed the second one.

He was very happy and surprised.

It seemed that the Spiritual Sea Realm was only one step away from the Primordial Gold Core, but actually, the disparity between them was astonishingly great.

Especially for Jian Wushuang, who was cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill, breaking through the Gold Core was definitely his top priority.

After all, the Primordial Gold Core was the only real expert in the Tianzong Dynasty.

“Let’s do it,” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

Jian Wushuang did not dare to waste any time. He had come here to begin the breakthrough as soon as he had realized that he had the chance. He was holding a Golden-sun Pill tightly in his hand, and then swallowed the pill right after he began to make the breakthrough.

Shortly after, the Ultimate Spiritual Sea and Spiritual Power surged up in Jian Wushuang’s body. At the same time, the power of the Heavenly Creation Skill was running in his body. Suddenly, a terrific suction burst out from his body, and then the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy from all directions poured into Jian Wushuang’s body at an amazing speed.

Jian Wushuang was crazily absorbing the power.

When Jian Wushuang absorbed the last Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy along with his breath, the power in his body had reached its limit. Suddenly, the vast Spiritual Power crazily rushed toward the barrier.

“Bang!”

There was a muted thud.

Jian Wushuang seemed a little bit quiet.

“The bottleneck had been broken through. The next task is achieving the Supreme Gold Core Realm!” Jian Wushuang thought.

The Heavenly Creation Skill was totally different from common cultivation methods.

It was the Primordial Gold Core when ordinary warriors broke through the Gold Core. While it was Supreme Gold Core when the Gold Core was broken through via the Heavenly Creation Skill.

“Hum~~~!”

Above the vast Spiritual Sea, the Spiritual Power was crazily surging, which was accompanied by a touch of purple light. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This purple light was an embryo. It was very small, however, it was extremely dazzling, and it became more dazzling and bigger under the vast surging Spiritual Power.

Finally, a purple Gold Core slowly formed, the size of a baby’s fist. At the right moment when it was formed, the surface of the Gold Core split and, shortly after, two golden fringes appeared.

Finally, the Gold Core became Purple Gold.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. There was a beam of blue-white light that brushed over his dark pupils.

“It’s the Supreme Gold Core Realm. I have achieved it!” Jiang Wushuang said to himself.

On the couch, Jian Wushuang twisted his neck a few times, accompanied by the clear sound of bones cracking. He slightly clenched his palms and suddenly he could feel a strong power, which made him smile.

The next minute, Jian Wushuang exerted the strength in his palms toward the void in the front of him.

“Bang!”

Suddenly, a burst of a crisp sound filled the whole void.

“Supreme Gold Core Realm. This is the Supreme Gold Core Realm,” Jian Wushuang said with his eyes gleaming.

Jian Wushuang did not realize what the real Supreme Gold Core Realm was until he had actually achieved it.

The same as the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path and the Ultimate Spiritual Sea in the past.

Supreme Gold Cores were pretty different from the ordinary Gold Cores.

Supreme Gold Cores were way more powerful than the common Primordial Gold Cores.

“Up till now, my achievement was just in the Initial Gold Core Realm, yet now I’ve just achieved the Supreme Gold Core. However, I feel my Spiritual Power is 100 times more powerful than the ordinary Initial Gold Core Realm!” Jian Wushuang said with great surprise.

He just threw a punch into the air with 50 percent of his power, however, the power that erupted from his body was far more powerful than in the Profound Gold Core Realm.

“If I punch with 100 percent of my power, my power will be comparable with the normal Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Maybe I am even more powerful,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The strength that erupted from the Initial Gold Core Realm could match that in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm?

What does that mean?

“Only the unbelievable Heavenly Creation Skill can incredibly achieve this,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The Heavenly Creation Skill—all its movements were unbelievable and different.

For the Spirit Path Level, the difference between Jian Wushuang and common warriors was that he had two more realms than they had.

For the Level of Spiritual Sea, the difference between Jian Wushuang and common warriors was that he had limitless Spiritual Power.

However, for the Primordial Gold Core Realm, the difference between Jian Wushuang and common warriors was the strength!

Strength erupted from the Gold Core.

The strength that erupted from the Supreme Gold Core was 100 times more powerful than the Gold Core at the same stage!

The strength that erupted from the Initial Completion of the Gold Core Realm could match the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

“Starting today, I am an expert in the Tianzong Dynasty,” Jian Wushuang thought. He stood up and there was a vigorous breath that emanated from him.

“With the power equal to the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, plus the sword essence apperception at the 11th level of the Dragon Gate, how powerful am I right now? I’m not sure if I can beat the powerhouses on the Earthly Dragon List,” Jian Wushuang thought, with his hands clenched tightly.

Once Jian Wushuang achieved the Supreme Gold Core Realm, the ordinary disciples of the Dragon Palace would be no longer his competitors, including Bai Cheng. The only person who could compete with him was Su Lie, who was on the Earthly Dragon List.

But, Jian Wushuang was pretty confident that he could compete with Su Lie. He was 90 percent sure that he could beat him!

In the Manor, Wang Yuan and Su Rou were waiting for Jian Wushuang.

“It’s unbelievable that Wushuang dared to go through the 11th level of the Dragon Gate. In addition, right now he had another chance at a breakthrough if he could achieve the Primordial Gold Core Realm successfully. Woah…” Wang Yuan said with admiration.

Su Rou agreed while slightly nodding her head.

Jian Wushuang went through the 11th level sword essence of the Dragon Gate. If he could achieve the Gold Core, his power would reach a high level.

“Squeak!”

Suddenly, the door in Jian Wushuang’s room was opened. The next moment, Jiang Wushuang went inside slowly with a confident smile on his face.

Wang Yuan and Su Rou looked at him immediately and realized what happened right after they noticed the Gold Core scent emanating from his body.

Finally, Jian Wushuang had achieved the breakthrough.
