Chapter 2518: Defeated

“Don’t let him go! Quick! Block his path!”

The Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor let out a stern shout with his booming hysterical voice.

Several Ultimate Gods around the Governor of Demonic Moon Prefecture were still in shock. Nonetheless, the three Ultimate Gods closest to their target immediately reacted upon hearing the distraught shouting.

“Let’s take him down together!”

The three Ultimate Gods placed themselves in front of Jian Wushuang, blocking his path, and were just about to launch an attack.

Hum!

Those three Ultimate Gods had trouble telling which one was the real Jian Wushuang when 11 apparitions appeared out of thin air at the same time.

Three sword-lights lit up and sliced through those three Ultimate Gods’ necks when they were still caught in a limbo.

Their eyes widened in horror from being surprised by the sword speed of that Divine Demon and could not even react before their heads flew off.

In a span of mere seconds, their consciousness was gone.

“Are you really Primary-Level Ultimate Gods? Tch!” Jian Wushuang’s lips curled slightly.

The differences between Primary-Level Ultimate Gods and the High-Level Ultimate Gods were huge, but strenuous efforts were required in order for a High-Level Ultimate God to kill a Primary-Level Ultimate God.

Normally, three Primary-Level Ultimate Gods together could even engage in a riveting head-on fight against a High-Level Ultimate God.

Unfortunately, their opponent was none other than the unfathomable Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang possessed the combat prowess of a High-Level Ultimate God. In addition, his speed was extremely fast, and he had his Space-time Law.

A deep understanding of Space-time Law to be exact.

The three Ultimate Gods had no time to react with his 11 apparition disguises and his sword moving at warped speeds. They did not even have the opportunity to unleash an attack before all of them died to his sword.

“Run! Run!”

The governor dared not stay any longer, made a swift turn around, and fled for his life from the untenable situation.

Of course, the remaining three Ultimate Gods also fled without hesitation.

In a blink of an eye, those four had vanished from Jian Wushuang’s sight along with the heavy restrictive shield which enshrouded the area soon dissipated.

Jian Wushuang watched the four escape but made no efforts to chase after them.

It was easy for him to kill a Primary-Level Ultimate God but considerably arduous to kill a high-level one.

“Although the governor is a High-Level Ultimate God, he probably hasn’t been at that level for long and only has a rudimentary understanding of Space-time Law. His strength is probably at rock bottom among the High-Level Ultimate Gods. I only used the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment Technique, yet I could easily defeat him with only Space-time Law,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He knew his current strength barely reached the combat prowess of a High-Level Ultimate God level as when he fought with Yun Zhen against Strange Old Feng in the Wusha Wilderness.

After his strength skyrocketed he obtained his Life Armor, cultivated the Nine Sparkle Star Armor Secret Technique, and reached the Golden Armor chapter. He was then sufficiently capable to oppress Yun Zhen.

In the battle against the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor, he neither used Nine Sparkle Star Armor nor Divine God of Punishment, but could still easily defeat the governor.

The only explicable reason would have been the governor’s strength was too weak and ranked at the bottom even among High-Level Ultimate Gods.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the laws had improved greatly.

It had been seven or eight months since he departed from Wusha Wilderness. During that time, Jian Wushuang had been sitting on the double-horned Thunderous Star Beast and worked on his cultivation. Besides that, he did not only relied solely on his own ability but on Fengtian Scroll’s support.

Although the Fengtian Scroll was not as helpful when he was in Saint’s Tomb, it was still beneficial to Jian Wushuang.

In just seven to eight months, his understanding of Space-time Law had improved so much that he went from just having two apparitions to eleven apparitions. Was that not impressive?

His sword skills had also improved tremendously.

“The governor is too weak. If it’s someone slightly stronger, I’m afraid I will only be able to win by executing Divine God of Punishment or Nine Sparkle Stars Armor.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

However, he had not realized those members from Xueya Escort behind him were completely stunned!

Yes, they were stunned to see what happened.

They were furious when they saw Jian Wushuang merely showing divine powers at the level of a Peak Divine Demon Realm.

They thought Jian Wushuang was just fooling around with them.

However...

The very same Peak Divine Demon had defeated those Demonic Moon Prefecture experts right before their eyes.

And he did not simply drive them away but managed to intimidate them and even killed three of their Ultimate Gods.

How terrifying he must be to have done that?

“He must be a genius!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

One of Xueya Excort’s deputy captains exclaimed, “I once heard there were pools of talents in the Ancient God Domain and many of them were monsters. They had the combat prowess of an Ultimate God when they were merely in the Divine Demon realm. Some of them were capable of killing an Ultimate God! I thought that was just hearsay, but I saw it with my own eyes today.”

“It’s simply amazing he could defeat High-Level Ultimate God head-on and even beheaded three Primary-Level Ultimate Gods while being at the Divine Demon realm!”

The others were also shocked.

Even though they were terribly shocked, they were still able to accept what just happened.

There were Peak Divine Demons in Ancient God Domain who could kill Primary-Level Ultimate Gods after all.

They were just lucky to have met one.

However, they would be even more shocked to realize that Jian Wushuang was merely a Second-Class Divine Demon were he not had that black stone disguising his actual cultivation level.

It was impossible for a Second-Class Divine Demon to kill a Primary-Level Ultimate God!

Xiao Tiexin took a deep breath, calmed his nerves, and stepped forward with a hint of respect. “Thank you for your actions, you’ve just helped the Xueya Escort Team to resolve a crisis!”

“Thank you for what you have done, Master,” said the other members of the Xueya Escort Team.

Faced with someone who killed a Primary-Level Ultimate God at Peak Divine Demon, the Xueya Escort Team was respectful toward Jian Wushaung.

Tiexin was almost at the strength of a High-Level Ultimate God yet she had addressed Jian Wushuang politely. Whereas everyone else, including the two Ultimate God deputy captains, had to call Jian Wushuang as Master.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “There’s no need for that. Captain Xiao, just don’t forget the deal between us.”

“Of course I won’t. I don’t know what you’re looking for, but I’ll tell you everything I know,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang did not speak. Instead, he looked at the others from Xueya Escort Team.

Xiao Tiexin understood and immediately ordered, “No. 2 and No. 3, go around and see if all those people from Demonic Moon Prefecture have escaped. Check if any of those people whom we are supposed to escort had survived. If anyone survives, bring them back to where we are.”

“Yes.”

The two deputy captains nodded and immediately brought someone to search the nearby area. Their departure gave Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin some space to speak privately.
