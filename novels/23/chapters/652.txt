Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Xuan Yi paused, and then he continued, “I promised you that you would become an inner disciple of the Ancient Sect at the end of round three. This has not changed.”

“In the Ancient Sect, no matter what you want, you have to fight for it yourself.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

“Shi Qianhan.” Xuan Yi looked at Shi Qianhan and said in a cold voice, “You have promised him a lot. But if his growth in the Cloud Sea Asgard doesn’t meet your expectations, I’m afraid you will not keep your promise, right?”

“This...?” Shi Qianhan’s eyes froze a little.

In the Cloud Sea Asgard, there were many disciples and the competition between them was stiff. Everything depended on strength.

He had promised Jian Wushuang a lot. But if Jian Wushuang didn’t perform well in the Cloud Sea Asgard, to not waste the resources, the Cloud Sea Asgard would certainly not keep their promise.

“Humph!”

Xuan Yi snorted, then he turned to Jian Wushuang, said. “Young man, people in the Firmament Territory know who I am. If I bring you back to the Ancient Sect, I will try my best to support you and improve your strength to a higher level even if your potential is exhausted.”

“It is what I can promise you, and this is also what the Ancient Sect can promise you.”

“The Ancient Sect will never give up on any of its disciples no matter how weak his strength or talent is!”

The words reverberated through the whole battle field and inspired all those present.

His promise was much more sincere than Shi Qianhan’s.

Jian Wushuang was also moved. Turning to Shi Qianhan, he was clear at a glance.

“Although he promised me a lot, I could only get them based on improvement in strength, which means that I have to fight for it by?myself?. It’s the same with what the Ancient Sect has promised me.”

“Compared with Shi Qianhan, Master Xuan Yi is much more sincere.”

“The Ancient Sect will never give up on any of its disciples!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and made a decision. Then he raised his head.

“Master Xuan Yi, I have decided to join the Ancient Sect!” Jian Wushuang said earnestly. Then he turned to Shi Qianhan and said, “I’m sorry, Elder Shi. Your offer is tempting. But Master Xuan Yi had invited me at the end of round three, I cannot refuse him.”

Xuan Yi smiled slightly, it seemed he had already expected this result.

But Shi Qianhan became angry, as a hint of cruelty flashed in his eyes.

“Young man, think about it carefully. As the most powerful sect in the Firmament Territory, the Cloud Sea Asgard has the most resources. What’s more, you have just come to the Eternal World, I’m afraid you are not aware of the danger here. It’s easy to be killed without the protection of a powerful sect.”

“In the Firmament Territory, only the Cloud Sea Asgard can protect you from being killed by others!”

“Take this seriously.”

Shi Qianhan spat out the last sentence.

Hearing that, many geniuses on the Drill Grounds and experts in the Skyward Pavilion frowned.

They were aware that Shi Qianhan was hinting at something. It was more like a threat.

Yes, it was a threat.

He threatened that if Jian Wushuang didn’t join the Cloud Sea Asgard, the Cloud Sea Asgard would become his enemy and kill him one day!

Jian Wushuang was sullen. Having experienced so much in the Ancient World, he understood what Shi Qianhan was saying. He looked over at Xuan Yi.

This was the someone he had to depend on.

“Shi Qianhan!” Xuan Yi’s calm and cold voice arose.

“What? Did I say something wrong?” Shi Qianhan glanced at Xuan Yi, being high-handed as the Ninth Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard–the most powerful sect in the Firmament Territory. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“No, you’re right.” Xuan Yi nodded slightly, “The Eternal World is a dangerous place.”

“So you agree with me.” Shi Qianhan said with a cold smile. But suddenly his smile froze.

He saw a sparkling sword light heading towards him.

An ice-cold and dazzling sword light!

Everyone’s attention was caught by it as soon as it appeared.

They couldn’t help staring at it.

Then the sword light moved fast.

So fast!

So fast as if it had gone beyond the limit of time and space.

At an incredible speed!

Facing the unexpected attack, all of them were astonished.

“Xuan Yi!”

Shi Qianhan was panic-stricken. He had never expected that Xuan Yi, who was calm and nice just now, would suddenly attack him with such a terrible Killing Move.

It was too fast.

Geniuses on the Drill Grounds, including Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao, couldn’t see it clearly.

Even the top Divine Realm experts in the Skyward Pavilion couldn’t do it.

Only a few of the Eternal Realm experts present could do this, but they still couldn’t follow it.

Such as Shi Qianhan.

As the sword approached, Shi Qianhan couldn’t even defend against it. He could only cry out.

Woosh!

The dazzling sword light passed through. Shi Qianhan’s body was cut in half like a piece of paper.

Although they had not yet figured out how the sword moved, they saw clearly at the next moment that Shi Qianhan, the Ninth Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, had already been cut in half!
