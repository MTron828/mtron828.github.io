Chapter 5385 - 5385: Shen Ling and Zhen Ling

Translator: Endlessæantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

If the path of divine body strayed, but he wasn’t worried; he could always correct course later.

However, if he was astray on his Dao path, he would carry that regret for a lifetime.

Whew!

Exhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang retracted his aura and landed on the ground once again. He expressed gratitude, “Senior’s techniques are truly remarkable. The external power of the Beast God Weapon has recovered significantly, and its might surpasses that of ordinary Eternal Treasures.”

After exchanging pleasantries once more, Jian Wushuang left with Bai Junwang.

Questions arose.

He couldn’t let Bai Junwang sense any strangeness.

Although both individuals owed him great favors, their paths diverged.

One was the divine spirit, Shen Ling. Meanwhile, the other the true spirit, Zhen Ling.

These two forces couldn’t be judged on the same scale.

The Shen Ling had been suppressed for countless years, and in his eyes, the Qishen Temple was nothing short of demonic.

The Zhen Ling, on the other hand, merely followed the original intention of the Qishen, suppressing those ancient savage beasts. Releasing them would only bring calamity.

This was understandable.

It was simply impossible to untangle.

Jian Wushuang found himself caught in the middle, suspiciously benefiting from both sides. However, he truly didn’t care.

Now that he bore the identity of a Kui member, Shen Ling probably already knew.

Since the old man with goat horns could still help him, it meant the issue wasn’t significant.

He also feared the wrath of the Zhen Ling, fearing they might slaughter him.

But after Dragon Yi returned last time, nothing happened. This suggested that nobody really cared about his allegiance or whether he posed a threat.

Everything flowed naturally.

It was quite convenient.

With the background of being an inheritor, it was not conducive to self-cultivation,

Just like Hu Qing, wherever he went, she was treated as an honored guest. Even in the Earth Realm, there was not much reverence for the Divine Temple or Grave God Mountain.

But it was also unwise to offend unilaterally.

The Heavenly Court was a perfect example!

Sneaking into the Forest of Eternal Secrets resulted in the destruction of the Nalan family.

The entire Earth Realm rallied, unafraid of the Divine Temple’s influence in the realm. However, when a powerful figure from the Divine Temple emerged, they wiped out the Nalan family. No one dared to speak up for them.

That was asking for trouble!

The Divine Temple lacked not top-tier combat power but control over the forces in the Earth Realm.

Only by understanding this principle did the forces in the Earth Realm dare to act this way.

After Jian Wushuang returned to the palace with the Beast God Weapon, he began to prepare for the matter of the Beast God origin source.

In a quiet secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on a jade bed.

The sea of origin source within his body had not completely solidified. A single, ultimate pillar of origin stood tall in the center, with Jian Wushuang standing above it.

The Beast God Weapon floated in front of him, its origin source leaking out.

Gently touching a strand of the Beast God’s origin source, the entire sea of origin source trembled, countless patterns appearing. Although Jian

Wushuang couldn’t fully understand, he could roughly make sense of it.

After all, his spatial origin source had already come a long way.

“All Things, and also space!” Jian Wushuang frowned.

It was difficult and troublesome to extract the origin source from one’s own origin source.

Later, the external true self split into a clone, embarking on a journey to various major businesses in the imperial city. He purchased numerous origin source treasures of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, creating a complex assortment.

Billions of godstones were spent.

Utilizing the power of All Things, he sensed the origin source within these treasures and then, using the power of devouring, swallowed and condensed them.

Unfortunately, the process was too challenging. Of the billions worth of treasures, 90 percent was wasted, and only a trace of origin source was reluctantly forged.

This trace of origin source was already very close to the origin source of the Beast God.

Swish!

In his hand appeared a blood crystal of the gold Beast God. These blood crystals were extremely precious, originally intended for his own integration.

But now, in order to quickly enhance his strength, they had to be injected into the Beast God Weapon.

Buzz!

The mighty gold origin source was devoured by the tremendous power of devouring.

The gold origin source was originally spatial in nature, coupled with the trace of origin source condensed from the power of All Things.

The two merged slowly.

Boom!

The sea of origin source trembled once again.

“It failed!” Jian Wushuang frowned, but he didn’t lose heart.

He had plenty of the power of All Things. Although the extraction of the Five Elements origin source was challenging, it could be purchased.

Continuing to purchase a large number of treasures, he extracted and fused them.

It took seven attempts before he successfully condensed with the origin source of the Beast God.

The difficulty in this process was immense. If it weren’t for these sources constantly being refined for Bai Junwang, he wouldn’t have succeeded so easily.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Buzz!

A buzzing sound echoed, and the origin within the Beast God Weapon grew stronger, requiring some time to adapt.

The continuous buzzing made Jian Wushuang’s heart palpitate!

Too powerful.

The origin source was successfully refined, and the trace of origin in the Eye of the Candle Dragon finally began to penetrate the entire Beast God Weapon.

In fact, it also covered the other two items.

With the addition of the origin source, the inner armor became even more powerful, especially the Candle Dragon Wings. After obtaining the origin source, it was almost like possessing two completely different treasures compared to before.

Now, the Candle Dragon Wings, with just a spread of its wings, could unleash an aura reminiscent of ancient times.

“That’s the Qi Feathers!” Bai Junwang exclaimed in surprise!

He hadn’t expected the origin source refined by Jian Wushuang to be so powerful.

Even the unique skill Qi Feathers’ from the time when the Beast God Weapon was intact could be displayed.

Jian Wushuang retracted the feather wings and looked at Bai Junwang curiously, asking, “Qi Feathers? What is that?”

“l haven’t seen it either, but when I was in the River of Time, 1 once mentioned it to a Universe Master 1 followed. One of the nine Beast God Weapons, the Candle Dragon, has a move called Qi Feathers. When unleashed at full power, the sharp feathers can shatter even the mighty Universe Masters, and a tier 6 Emperor would be as fragile as thin paper!” Bai Junwang explained with excitement.

Back then, he was only a tier 5 Emperor, following a Universe Master of comparable strength and not very prominent.

The nine Divine Masters who wielded the Beast God Weapons were extraordinary, dominating the space-time continuum.

Weak Universe Masters would bow their heads in their presence.

Bai Junwang had never seen it himself, only heard about it.

Now, witnessing it with his own eyes, although it hadn’t reached the level described, it was already impressive to him.

If Jian Wushuang could really gather the complete Beast God Weapon ‘Candle Dragon’ in the future, he might be unmatched in the entire River of Time.

He had heard that in the current River of Time where the Qishen Temple was located, Universe Masters were rare, and there might not even be any.

In such a weak space-time, Jian Wushuang could roam freely.

Jian Wushuang once again spread his feather wings, his figure rotating, and instantly burst forth.

A burst of white aura erupted around him, indeed releasing numerous sharp feathers, each one incredibly sharp. Enough to strangle a tier 3 emperor.

Indeed powerful.

Now that he had just opened up the origin source, in the future, he would need to nurture his own power of All Things.

As for the Beast God Blood Crystals, integrating them would be too wasteful.

When he merged the paths or became an Emperor later, these blood crystals would be extremely useful.

Unconsciously, two months had passed.

The clone in the royal mansion had been managing the affairs of the private army.

The Luo Hou Formation couldn’t afford to be careless.

This time, in the attack on the MO Luo Nation, it was for the Candle Dragon Arm that the MO Luo Crown Prince possessed.

With the opponent’s pinnacle tier 4 strength, coupled with his distinguished identity, there might even be tier 5 emperors around him.

To kill him would be quite challenging, so he had to be fully prepared..
