2023 Ranking Competition

“You’re right,” Abysmal Saint Master and the other Great Emperors nodded in agreement.

The experts on the highest rank in Imperial Cabinet were definitely paying attention to the unknown experts, especially those who were extremely careful and afraid to be in the limelight.

Hence, it made sense if he did exactly the opposite.

“Imperial Peak is the core of Imperial City. We have to figure out a way to get into Imperial Peak. However, the ranking competition is five years away. We can only wait five years,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If it’s only for five years. We can afford to wait,” Abysmal Saint Master and the other two Great Emperors said.

Then, they started waiting patiently.

The three Great Emperors continued to stay in Blood Mountain Sword but never came out. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang utilized the five years to cultivate the Immemorial Celestial Body.

Immemorial Celestial Body would definitely be useful to Jian Wushuang if he cultivated it successfully.

Five years passed by very quickly as he cultivated.

“Mister,”

The waiter in black from the bar entered the secret room with Jian Wushuang’s permission, “It’s time for the ranking competition. I’ll take you there now.”

“Alright, lead the way.”

Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived at a huge independent space under the lead of the waiter in black.

“Mister, the ranking competition among experts in early stage Chaotic Realm will be carried out in this independent space. This is your identity token,” the waiter in black passed Jian Wushuang a token.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang smiled and then stepped into the independent space.

The independent space was boundless. It wouldn’t even be a problem for a few experts in peak Chaotic Realm to fight in there, let alone the cultivators of the early stage chaotic realm.

There were many cultivators in the independent space and every one of them were experts in early stage chaotic realm. There were more than a hundred people in one glance.

“Haha, it’s quite busy here.”

Jian Wushuang stepped into the independent space and let out a burst of hearty laughter.

His laughter reverberated through the entire independent space and the experts in the space looked at Jian Wushuang.

When they saw Jian Wushuang, whose aura was ferocious as a beast’s, the experts looked surprised.

“Who is this? I have never seen him before.”

“No idea. He should be an expert who just came to Imperial City not too long ago.”

“Hehe. I know this person. His name is Ah Shou. He isn’t famous in Three-Emperors World. It is his first time in Imperial City. However, he is barbaric in nature. I heard that he fought with Lin Tianhao from Lin Family the moment he entered Imperial City. Both of them fought too.”

Many people immediately looked at the handsome Lin Tianhao the moment they heard that.

Lin Tianhao joined the ranking competition too. Then, he was standing next to the lady in green. When he noticed Jian Wushuang’s arrival, there was a flash of coldness in his eyes.

“This b*stard is such a show-off,” Lin Tianhao muttered.

“Don’t worry about him. He is so silly. He wouldn’t even know if he died,” the lady in green said.

“Humph, don’t let me fight against him later. Otherwise…” Lin Tianhao’s gaze grew even colder.

Although the ranking competition in Imperial City happened every once in a hundred years, only the top five were allowed to enter Imperial Peak. However, there were too many cultivators in Three-Emperors World who wanted to enter Imperial Peak.

Hence, it was the reason why it would stir up a ferocious commotion during the ranking competition every one hundred years.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, there were a few figures that appeared in the independent space. The leading person had white hair and a white beard. He was the elder that stopped Jian Wushuang and Lin Tianhao from fighting last time.

The elder was a deacon in Imperial Cabinet and he was hosting the ranking competition that day.

“Everyone is almost here. Let’s begin.”

The elder looked around and his voice bright and clear, “The rules for this ranking competition are the same as before. It will be segregated into two parts. The first round of competition would be the elimination round. Your opponent is him.”

The elder waved and a brawny figure in silver armor appeared in the independent space.

The brawny figure looked stoned and there were no emotions in his eyes. He obviously wasn’t a human cultivator.

“This is… a Dao soldier?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

He, of course, recognized the brawny figure. He was very familiar with it.

The silver armor and the unique aura, it was obviously a Dao soldier from ancient times. It was a silver-armored Dao soldier.

Under normal circumstances, the power of silver-armored Dao soldiers was Emperor God level. In other words, middle stage Chaotic Realm level. It was stronger than the cultivators from early stage Chaotic Realm at the scene. However, Dao soldier didn’t know any killing tactics. Hence, its fighting power was far behind a middle stage chaotic realm expert.

“What you need to do is take turns to attack. Within ten thousand miles range, fight with this Dao soldier for more than ten breaths without being defeated. Then, you will be qualified to enter the second round,” the elder waved and there was a region engulfed in purple light cover around the silver-armored Dao soldiers.

The region was about ten thousand miles.

Then, everyone’s expressions grew solemn.

Most of them wouldn’t care if they had to fight with silver-armored Dao soldier. As long as they were smart enough to not fight head-on with the silver-armored Dao soldier but deal with it via their speed and flexibility, anyone could last for ten breaths against the silver-armored Dao soldier. However, the difficulty became more intense when they were limited to ten thousand miles.

Within ten thousand miles, it would be hard for the experts in early stage Chaotic Realm to perform their speed and skills. In short, they would be on the defensive during their fight against the silver-armored Dao soldier. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Let’s begin. Come to the front when I call your name,” the elder didn’t explain much and started reading names.

The first one was a lady in red who used a red sickle as her weapon.

Her power wasn’t considered to be as weak among early stage chaotic realm. However, there was too much restriction within ten thousand miles. Her speed couldn’t be put to play at all. In the end, she only lasted for six breaths of time and she was defeated by the silver-armored Dao soldier.

The second one was worse. He only lasted for three breaths.

The third and fourth ones failed too.

Until the fifth person, he barely lasted ten breaths against the silver-armored Dao soldiers after putting all his skills to play.

“Restricted within ten thousand miles. Many people couldn’t perform their skills. It is too difficult to last ten breaths of time against the silver-armored Dao soldiers.”

“There are a hundred people but I’m afraid there might not even be one-third of them who could pass the first round,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.
