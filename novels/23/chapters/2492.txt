Chapter 2493: Territory Lord

Ancient God Domain was vast and borderless.

Wusha Wilderness was only a small portion of the Ancient God Domain and was easily ignored.

In normal circumstances, only when multiple Wilderness combined would a star territory formed.

When multiple Star Territories combined, it then became a Domain.

For example, Crimson Stone Saint was a Domain Lord in his mortal life who established the Crimson Stone Fort and was in complete control of a whole Domain. There were a total of 381 Star Territories within his domain.

A Domain Lord was a prominent figure in Ancient God Domain. Usually, only experts who were an Undying Saint or above were qualified to become the lord of a certain domain.

Although a Star Territorial Lord could not be compared with a Domain Lord, to be capable of leading so many Wilderness would require one to have possessed extremely high abilities.

“As far as I know, Northern Darkstar Territory has at least a hundred Wilderness. Our Wusha Wilderness is merely one of them. Every millennium, sects from each wilderness would honor the Territorial Lord by offering a certain number of Primordial Stones, just like how federalists in mortal worlds would make offerings to their emperor every certain period. Of course, a Star Territorial Lord could be considered an ’emperor’ on his own,” said Wujian.

Jian Wushuang nodded quietly.

The Territorial Lord controls the entire star territory which contains many wilderness sects who made offerings every millennium. The number of sects from the accumulative wilderness were so numerous that those Primordial Stones a Territorial Lord received every millennium were huge.

“A Territorial Lord must be very powerful to force sects from every wilderness to provide Primordial Stones tributes with every millennium, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. In the Ancient God Domain, almost every Star Territorial Lord is at least an Earth Ultimate God with some even being Heaven Ultimate Gods in order for them to keep the entire wilderness under control by themselves. Furthermore, every Territorial Lord has his official army which has extremely high battle strength filled with Ultimate Gods and Divine Demons. They are also the Territorial Lord’s means to stay in power,” said Wujian.

“Is Earth Ultimate God the weakest within the Ultimate God cultivation level?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

In the Ancient God Domain, ‘Ultimate Gods’ can be further sub-categorized to Regular Ultimate God, Earth Ultimate God, Heaven Ultimate, and Grand Ultimate God.

The four categories of Ultimate Gods had tremendous strength differences. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When one broke through to a new cultivation level, his ability would have fundamental changes.

In Wusha Wilderness, the Ultimate Gods Jian Wushuang had met were merely Regular Ultimate Gods.

For example, the three Supreme Elders were only at primary level Regular Ultimate God. The Lord of Great Compassion Sect, Yun Zhen, was only a High-Level Regular Ultimate God.

Above High-Level Regular Ultimate Gods were Peak Regular Ultimate God. Only after going through that could one have the opportunity to make a breakthrough into the ranks of Earth Ultimate God.

‘In many wildernesses under Northern Darkstar Territory, Regular Ultimate God is already the highest rank they could achieve. It’s difficult to produce an Earth Ultimate God. Even if one was produced, he or she would choose to wander into the larger territory. They would seldom stay at a star territory to become the local authority. As for this Territorial Lord, he had the battle strength of an Earth Ultimate God and a powerful official army under him. That’s why many sects within the wilderness had to make Primordial Stones offerings. If he made an order, no one within Northern Darkstar Territory would dare defy him,’ Jian Wushuang exclaimed in his mind.

“Jian Wushuang, you could very well become an Earth Ultimate God since you have such talents. If you are willing, you could also find ways to conquer a star territory and become a Territorial Lord by then and enjoy your position as a local authority,” said Wujian in jest.

“Haha, we’ll see by then!” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Wujian thought Jian Wushuang was only answering him perfunctorily. He had no idea the thought of becoming a Territorial Lord had begun growing in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

After all, as soon as one became a Territorial Lord, one would receive a huge number of Primordial Stones every millennium, and Jian Wushuang needed Primordial Stones.

However, he knew very well that if he could not even defeat a High-Level Regular Ultimate God such as Yun Zhen, he was truly far from becoming an Earth Ultimate God.

Wujian stayed at the Governor’s Residence for two days before returning to Narcissus Island. Jian Wushuang did not try asking him to stay.

The third day after Wujian left one of the Great Compassion Sect’s Supreme Elders, An Junzhu arrived at Blazing Moon City.

“These are three thousand pieces of Primordial Stones that we and all those sects had gathered. Lord Yun Zhen instructed me to bring you these three thousand pieces first. As for the instrumental cultivation materials, the Great Compassion Sect will collect them and Lord Yun Zhen shall personally send them to you,” said An Junzhu.

“In that case, please thank Lord Yun Zhen for me.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

After An Junzhu left, Jian Wushuang found a secret room and sat down cross-legged.

In front of him was a collection of 3,500 Primordial Stones in total.

An Junzhu had sent 3,000 while another 500 pieces were given by Narcissus Island.

Jian Wushuang randomly picked up a Primordial Stone and a terrifying ingesting power exploded. In a short moment, the pure divine powers that filled the Primordial Stone were completely absorbed by him.

“As expected!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with light. “Although one Primordial Stone’s worth on the market is equivalent to ten thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power, the divine powers contained in it is worth more than ten thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power. Most importantly, divine powers in Primordial Stone are a few times purer than Ancient God Divine Power, hence it helps me quite a lot.”

A total of three thousand and five hundred pieces of Primordial Stones...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining. The terrifying ingesting power exploded once again as it ruthlessly ingested and refined the Primordial Stones.

His speed of ingestion and refinement was unbelievable.

Within a day, he had finished refining all 3,500 Primordial Stones. The Primordial Stones had also turned into regular stones with some even cracked.

Phew!

Jian Wushuang exhaled lightly and gradually opened his eyes. “Compared to absorbing Ancient God Divine Power from Divine Power Ocean, absorbing Primordial Stones is more effective. It’s a shame that the number of Primordial Stones is not enough. Although refining three thousand five hundred pieces of Primordial Stones helped increase my divine powers, it didn’t help me to achieve a breakthrough. It’s even a little shy from reaching the peak of Second-Class Divine Demon. If I want to make a breakthrough to First-Class Divine Demon, I’ll need a lot more Primordial Stones!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes had shown a little desire as he once again thought of the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

“If I ever have a chance, I should try becoming a Territorial Lord...”
