Chapter 3430 Changing Fate

“Lord Tenshou, just tell me how much divine power you need to exchange for these items,” Jian Wushuang said.

He knew that the items he had exchanged for were of great value. For example, if he had only exchanged for the first few volumes of the nine books, it would not have been a big deal. However, if he had exchanged for all nine volumes…the price he would have to pay…it would probably be much higher than the entire wealth of an ordinary Principles Master.

However, the nine volumes of obliteration were indeed very useful to him.

It must be noted that he had already mastered two rules and fused them together. The next step was naturally to find a way to master the third principle.

Jian Wushuang had already planned to comprehend the third principle by comprehending the destruction principles. After all, he had the highest affinity for the destruction principles, which was no weaker than his affinity for the space-time principles.

The speed of comprehending the destruction principles would be much slower if he just blindly comprehended it. The nine volumes of Vastheaven included everything from the entry to perfect mastery of the destruction principles to the use of it after perfect mastery, it was extremely detailed, which was indeed very useful to him.

As for the Blizzard Divine Palace, it was a test method to test the destruction principles.

The Blizzard Divine Palace was divided into 33 levels, which corresponded to different levels of comprehension of the destruction principles. Jian Wushuang also wanted to go to the Blizzard Divine Palace to temper himself while comprehending the destruction principles, it would promote his comprehension.

Although the Blizzard Divine Palace was not as expensive as the nine volumes of Vastheaven extermination, it was almost as valuable as a supreme treasure.

The last two divine destruction fruits and the heaven-destroying elixir were supplementary treasures that were very helpful in comprehending the destruction principles. With the help of the divine destruction fruits and the heaven-destroying elixir, Jian Wushuang would be able to comprehend the principles more quickly.

It could be said that these things were what he needed.

As long as they were really useful, Jian Wushuang would not care about the value of these treasures.

“I’ve calculated it for you. The treasures you want together are worth 30,000 drops of divine power. If you add the 100 million drops of purple void divine water you asked for, it’s a total of 32,000 drops of divine power,” Tian Suo said.

“32,000 drops?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. As far as he knew, the average Principles Master of the three void realms only had about 10,000 drops of divine power. 32,000 drops of divine power…that was more than the total wealth of many experts of the void three realms.

“The reason why the price is so high is because the value of the nine exterminating cang scrolls is too high. In total, the treasure pavilion usually exchanges 25,000 drops of divine power for the nine scrolls. However, because you are an original level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, I gave you a discount. It’s only 20,000 drops of divine power,” Tian Suo said. “No problem. This is 32,000 drops of divine power. You can count it.” Jian Wushuang took out an interspatial ring. Tian Suo glanced at it and nodded slightly. “Not bad, Heavenly Sword Marquis. I didn’t know you were so rich.” “Eh.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although he was only an Immortal Saint and could not condense divine power, his strength was far above that of ordinary Principles Masters. Moreover, during the battle on Saha Island, he had been blessed by the Blood Wave Realm, he had killed several Principles Masters with one sword attack. Among them, the nether master and the four divine flame guards were experts at the peak of the void five realms.

Jian Wushuang had killed them with one sword attack. Naturally, he had also taken their interspatial rings, so his value had skyrocketed.

32,000 drops of divine power was not a big number for him at the moment.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, just wait here. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance will send you what you want in a few days,” Tian Suo said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jian Wushuang waited in the secret lair. Only three days later, someone from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance handed him the items he had exchanged for.

After the items were in his hands, Jian Wushuang met up with Demon Master Chenhuo and Zhao Mang.

“Chenhuo, this is the purple void divine water you need. Take a look and see if it’s enough.” Jian Wushuang handed the interspatial ring filled with purple void divine water to Demon Master Chenhuo.

Demon Master Chenhuo took it and glanced at it before nodding. “It’s enough. With this purple void divine water, I can definitely help this little guy change his fate. But before that, I have to find a quiet place. After all, it takes a long time to complete the change. Even if I do it myself, it will take at least three months.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you’d better protect us. Don’t let anyone disturb us.”

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang agreed readily.

Three days later… “This is it.”

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo stopped in a remote mountain range.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’ll change this little guy’s fate here. Although this place is remote, during the process of changing my fate, people will inevitably be attracted to me. I’ll have to rely on you to keep them out,” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“Chenhuo, from your words, it seems that many people will be attracted to you once you change your fate?” Jian Wushuang looked at Demon Master Chenhuo in surprise.

“You’ll find out later. However, there shouldn’t be any great experts around this territory. With your strength, you can handle everything,” said Demon Master Chenhuo.

“I’ll try my best.” Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes. “Zhao Mang, come with me.” Demon Master Chenhuo led Zhao Mang into the depths of the mountains and immediately opened a cave mansion, ready to change his fate.

As for Jian Wushuang, he sat down in a nearby mountain and took out a black scroll.

This black scroll was the first scroll of the nine exterminating firmament scrolls!

Although Jian Wushuang had a high affinity for the destruction principles, which was no less than his affinity for the space-time principles, he had not really entered the rudiments of the destruction principles because he had not tried to comprehend them before, now that he wanted to comprehend them, he naturally had to start from the most basic level.

The first scroll he took out was also aimed at the rudiments of the destruction principles from the beginning to the end.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the mountain and soon began to comprehend the principles of destruction. Gradually, a large amount of power of the principles of destruction began to gather around him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Time passed. For the first ten days, the mountain was very quiet. Jian Wushuang was still meditating on the principles of destruction. Deep in the mountain, Demon Master Chenhuo had already begun to help Zhao Mang change his fate, but at first, there was no movement, and the surrounding territory was very quiet. No other experts passed by.

Until a month after the beginning of the change, there was finally a change.
