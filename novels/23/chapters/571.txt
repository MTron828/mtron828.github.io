Chapter 572: Immortality

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The difficulty continually increased for each level of the Bone Fusion Technique. Even Temple Masters were barely able to receive Level 10. As for Level 11, whether they could inherit it depended on their own ability.

Level 11 was not difficult for Jian Wushuang.

After a while, the Level 11 manual was deeply imprinted on his mind.

Then he went on to Level 12, the last level of the Bone Fusion Technique.

It became hard for him. The moment he started to inherit the Level 12 manual, he felt an overwhelming pressure on him as if his organs were about to be smashed to pieces.

This unprecedented oppression was targeting his body. The longer it took to complete the Inheritance, the more powerful the oppression would become.

“It seems that inheriting the Level 12 manual requires a more powerful body. If my body doesn’t meet the requirement, I’ll have failed the Inheritance.”?Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth while trying his best to sustain the oppression.

“I finally know why no one has been able to reach Level 12 of the Bone Fusion Technique.”?Jian Wushuang wore a wry smile.

“Faced with such an overwhelming power, it’s almost impossible to receive the Level 12 manual, let alone master the Bone Fusion Technique.”

Jian Wushuang could barely endure this pressure with his amazing body. Even some powerful Temple Masters would probably be crushed under this oppression.

Time flowed slowly, but the Level 12 Inheritance eventually succeeded and the manual was engraved in his mind.

“It’s over?” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. He found himself wet with sweat.

“I suffered a lot, but it was worth it since I finally got the manual for Level 11 and Level 12.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Actually, a gleam of delight was hidden in his heart.

Right then...

“Hum?” There was a faint sound, but it appeared more resonant in such a quiet place.

“Who’s there?” Jian Wushuang looked around with a frown, but he saw nothing.

“Is it...” Jian Wushuang squinted and looked toward the broken scarlet finger.

“You have a sharp insight.” Faint laughter with a hint of arrogance rang out.

Just now, Jian Wushuang clearly heard and understood that it came from this broken finger.

“You’re talking?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly.

A broken finger was actually talking?

“Hehe, I didn’t expect that someone was able to inherit Chapter One of “Immortality?“, the Secret Skill I created. It’s rare to see in this small plane world.” The domineering voice rang out again.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

Immortality Secret Skill?

Chapter One?

The Bone Fusion Technique?

“When I was being chased by my enemies, I thought I would die, so I broke my 10 fingers. Each of my fingers, which contained a portion of my Inheritance, were scattered. Nine of them landed in my world and I took them back after I was out of danger, so no one gained the Inheritance from the other nine fingers.

“Only the 10th finger fell into this small plane world. Because of some limitations, I was unable to take it back and could only let it stay there. I didn’t expect that a little guy like you would be able to inherit my Bone Fusion Technique.”

Silence followed before the voice spoke again. “Since I can’t take it back and we’re destined to meet, I’ll give the Inheritance of this finger to you. I hope you will grow up and have the opportunity to come to my world.”

Jian Wushuang had no time to react before the broken scarlet finger suddenly radiated a brilliant red light, followed by even more information surging towards him.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to accept the inheritance.

“The Immortality Secret Skill!”

“Chapter One, Bone Fusion Technique!”

“Chapter Two, Blood Condensation Technique!”

“Chapter Three, Armor Technique!”

“Chapter Four, Divine Body Technique!”

Each of these Secret Skills had four chapters. Only the Bone Fusion Technique was fundamentally different, being comprised of 12 levels. Each of the other three techniques only had three levels.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang started to inherit Level One of the Blood Condensation Technique.

The Inheritance was so domineering that he was unable to refuse it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang could only accept the techniques, one by one.

Fortunately, inheriting the other three techniques was easier than the Bone Fusion Technique. There was no oppression on his body; it just took a lot of time.

As Jian Wushuang was inheriting the Immortality Secret Skill, time continued to pass by.

At the north border of the Human Territory, which was guarded by the North Camp...

Boom...

The ground suddenly shook violently, as if there was a huge earthquake.

“What’s happening?”

“What’s wrong?”

Many generals and soldiers did not know what was happening and the shaking was becoming more and more violent.

When countless Demonic Beasts appeared on the horizon, those sergeants finally grasped the cause.

“Demonic Beasts, it’s a Demonic Beast attack!”

“Those, those Demonic Beasts!”

“Oh, god, so many Demonic Beasts?”

The generals and soldiers, including three Temple Masters, were petrified when they saw the endless horde of Demonic Beasts.

The number of Demonic Beast was amazing.

Hundreds of thousands of Demonic Beasts had attacked the East Camp. However, it was nothing when compared to the number of Demonic Beasts in front of them now.

The whole area was covered by them like a swarm of locusts.

Some of them were walking on the ground while others were gliding in the sky.

Seen from afar, the army extended dozens of miles without an end.
