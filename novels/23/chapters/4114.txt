The white-haired youth, who was originally very casual, immediately changed his expression when he heard the words of the black-robed elder Yi Nu.

“68,000 miles of Divine Body? How is this possible?” The white-haired youth’s face was filled with disbelief.

One had to know that when he first entered the Life Nirvana Pool, he also received the opportunity for his Divine Body to expand explosively. At that time, his Divine Body had expanded to a height of 9,000 miles. This was already terrifying enough.

After all, Flame Mountain’s huge Divine Body, which was 6,000 miles long, had already attracted the envy of countless cultivators and special beings.

His 9,000-mile-tall Divine Body was even bigger than Flame Mountain’s, which was already very shocking.

However, compared to his 68,000-mile-tall Divine Body, his 9,000-mile-tall Divine Body was completely different.

“How is this possible? How could Jian Wushuang have such an incredible Divine Body?” The white-haired youth was extremely shocked.

“Although it’s incredible, many people have witnessed the process of Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body growing rapidly in the Life Nirvana Pool. It Can’t be faked. His Divine Body is indeed 68,000 miles tall. Moreover, he has also awakened his own innate divine power. This has made Ruler Blood Wave, who had been optimistic about him, even more fond of him.”

“Now, Ruler Blood Wave has personally brought Jian Wushuang to test the strength of his divine power. Ruler, the result of your Divine Power Test was 7,600 times that of an ordinary cultivator. It’s very heaven-defying. However, based on Jian Wushuang’s performance in the Life Nirvana Pool, it’s possible that his innate advantage will be further developed.”

“If Jian Wushuang’s divine power is stronger than yours, then Jian Wushuang’s basic potential will completely surpass yours. In the future, Ruler’s position in the Life Palace will also be greatly reduced,” Yi Nu said solemnly.

Hearing Yi Nu’s words, the white-haired youth’s face turned completely gloomy.

He was a perfect life form that was rare in the entire universe. He had grown up from the beginning of cultivation and was extremely talented and dazzling. As soon as he broke through to become a principle Ruler, he was taken to the Life Palace, after he arrived at the Life Palace, he was also valued and looked forward to by many higher-ups.

He had been far too dazzling, and his journey had been far too smooth. This had caused him to feel incomparably arrogant and even a bit conceited.

There were countless special lifeforms in the Life Palace, but not many of them were worthy of his attention.

However, perhaps it was because his path of growth had been far too smooth that when he reached the level of an omega Ruler, he had encountered his greatest bottleneck.

He had tried all sorts of methods and methods to reach the Omega Ruler level. He had tried everything he could, but he had been unable to break through to become an Ruler.

He was not the only one. The Life Palace had worked very hard to help him break through. They had given him all sorts of resources and treasures for free, in fact, the Life Palace had even sent the two perfect Rulers over to give him some personal guidance, all in the hopes that he would break through to become an Ruler as soon as possible.

However, despite the countless resources and treasures he had accumulated, he still showed no signs of breaking through at all.

Dozens of chaos cycles had passed, and he was still an omega Ruler. There was not even a hint of hope for him to make a breakthrough.

Because of this, the higher-ups of the Life Palace no longer held much hope for him to make a breakthrough. The Rulers who had been looking forward to his breakthrough had long since grown disappointed in him.

His status within the Life Palace was no longer as high as it had been before.

However, in the past, he had been the only perfect being amongst the Rulers of the Life Palace. Even if his chances of breaking through to become an Ruler in the future were slim, his status would not be any lower than before.

Over the years, the white-haired youth’s strength had not improved much, but the life sacred palace had always given him the resources he deserved.

The white-haired youth was unwilling to accept this situation, but he could still accept it.

But now, with Jian Wushuang’s arrival, everything was different.

Previously, he was the only perfect life-form in the Ruler-level of the Life Sacred Palace. For this reason, he was treated well.

However, now that Jian Wushuang had arrived, the white-haired young man was no longer the only one. Many of the higher-ups of the Life Palace were completely attracted to Jian Wushuang.

This made the white-haired young man feel a great crisis in his heart.

“I have already been disliked by the higher-ups in the Life Palace, and now Jian Wushuang has appeared. If the higher-ups of the Life Palace think that Jian Wushuang’s potential is much greater than mine, they will do their best to cultivate Jian Wushuang. I’m afraid that even the treatment that originally belonged to me will be omitted, not to mention fighting for more resources.” The white-haired young man clenched his hands, his eyes were extremely cold.

His Divine Body was 68,000 miles tall, and he had awakened his own innate divine power. If his divine power was stronger than his, then Jian Wushuang would be above him in all aspects.

The senior officials of the Life Palace would certainly not focus on him, a perfect life with little hope of making a breakthrough. Instead, they would focus all their attention on Jian Wushuang.

At that time, he would never be treated like this in the Life Palace. At most, he would be treated like a creation level life form, which was unacceptable to the white-haired young man.

“No matter what, I can’t lose what belongs to me. Jian Wushuang, you’re just a new kid. You want to challenge my status and treatment? Dream on!”

“I’ll prove it to those old guys. I’ll let them know that Jian Wushuang is just a kid. I’m the one who has the best chance of becoming the next Supreme-level perfect life-form in the Life Palace!”

The white-haired young man’s eyes shone with a fierce light.

“Yi Nu, let’s go and find him!”

The white-haired young man took Yi Nu, the black-clothed elder, and flew directly toward the place where Jian Wushuang was testing his divine power.

Jian Wushuang was led by Ruler Blood Wave to a temple.

The inside of the temple was actually a huge independent space. The entire independent space was a martial arts practice field, where there were all kinds of tools for cultivation.

In one corner of the martial arts practice field, there was a special magic array with puppet fighters standing inside.

Ruler Blood Wave brought Jian Wushuang to the magic array.
