Chapter 2746: Leaving The Secret Realm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Old Gu was watching Jian Wushuang strangely in the dark void.

“Little kid, your name is Su Han, right?” Old Gu asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Your methods are quite powerful despite the fact you seem to only be a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. I always feel that your divine power is a little weird for some reason,” said Old Gu.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank slightly.

He had in fact not reached the Primary-level Grand Ultimate God realm and was only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. The reason people would mistake him for being a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God was due to the black stone on his body that increased his divine power by two realms.

The black stone that Daoist Xuan Shen personally refined.

The black stone had disguised Jian Wushuang’s divine power. Although Old Gu could sense something weird, he failed to see what exactly was going on with Jian Wushuang’s divine power.

Old Gu’s eyes flickered with a strange luster. “Not only is your divine power a little weird, but the several secret techniques you have performed in this dark void are amazing. Although I can’t recognize some of them, I could feel that they are extremely extraordinary. In addition, the treasures you displayed... I can see you have many hidden secrets.”

Old Gu stared at Jian Wushuang with great interest.

Jian Wushuang was silent and said nothing at all.

“Little kid, don’t be nervous. Although I can see you have many hidden secrets, I won’t do anything to you. Perhaps my master might be interested in you if he was alive. As for me, I’m just a spirit of this secret realm who has wisdom but not life. They are of no use to me no matter how many secrets you have.” Old Gu smiled.

Jian Wushuang seemed a little more relaxed.

It was indeed as Old Gu said, he was only the secret realm’s spirit.

Just like the divine weapons, they had wisdom but would not turn against Jian Wushuang.

“In fact, you’re powerful while your method and temperament are also perfect. It’s a pity your current cultivation realm is still quite weak. If you have a chance to make a breakthrough and reach the Undying Saint realm in the future, you can come to this secret realm again and there’s a chance you may obtain the real opportunity left by my master.” Old Gu smiled.

His statement caught Jian Wushuang’s interest and he nodded slightly.

“Well, even the last opportunity I gave out is with you now. You have received enough so you may leave now and come back again when you’ve made a breakthrough to the Undying Saint realm,” said Old Gu and he waved his hand.

A spatial passage appeared in the void next to Jian Wushuang.

“Senior, farewell.”

Jian Wushuang did not linger around as he moved and stepped into the spatial passage before it disappeared.

Old Gu stood alone in the dark void watching the place Jian Wushuang disappeared with a strange smile on his face.

“Funny little kid—he has so many secrets.

“He has used several great secret techniques with each being extremely powerful. I’m afraid that even my master can’t handle them. In addition, there’s also that trick...”

Old Gu murmured with a rather strange expression.

Jian Wushuang had previously used several great secret techniques in the dark void whereby Old Gu could not recognize most of them, but he did know one particular technique.

It was the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!

“It was a Divine Technique from the Space-time Palace. Rumors mentioned that the technique was created by the Palace Master who was someone my master admired and worshiped.” Old Gu was praising the technique in his heart.

...

Jian Wushuang left the secret realm after stepping through the spatial passage and arrived at the City of Bones.

He was looking at the ancient dense forest that was filled with thick gray mist. Jian Wushuang sighed at the gloomy and mysterious atmosphere.

“I was quite lucky. Although Old Gu knew I carried a lot of secrets, he didn’t make things hard for me and even told me to make a breakthrough and reach the Undying Saint realm before returning to the secret realm again.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Jian Wushuang was indeed hoping to return to the secret realm again someday.

The secret realm’s master was a powerful Law Lord. He was someone formidable whose strength was beyond the Undying Saint realm.

A super expert like him must have left great opportunities and treasures in the secret realm. Jian Wushuang was unable to retrieve it because he was still weak.

He would be qualified to take up the challenges in the secret realm again once he became an Undying Saint in the future.

“I don’t know if I’ll come again in the future, but I’ve gained a lot from this trip.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tight from elation.

“I have benefited a lot from this secret realm. I should look for a place to settle down first and I’ll sort this out.”

Jian Wushuang moved and headed toward the outskirts of the City of Bones.

After leaving the City of Bones, Jian Wushuang immediately found a remote place and cracked open a cave before beginning to organize the treasures he collected in the cave.

He had gained a handsome amount of treasures from the trip.

The treasures Saber Master, God Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Devilish Wind King obtained from the secret realm surprised Jian Wushuang as he took them out one by one and examined them.

“Bronze Mirror...”

He first took out Long Xianzi’s bronze mirror.

The Bronze Mirror could execute the very powerful Golden Light Domain.

“It turns out it’s called Golden Feather Phantom Mirror.” Jian Wushuang held the Bronze Mirror that had already begun to acknowledge Jian Wushuang as its master.

The process was rather smooth and it only took a moment for the Golden Feather Phantom Mirror to merge into his body.

Thereafter, it fused with Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Buzz!

Mighty streams of golden light instantly diffused out.

Those golden rays of light were so dazzling that they permeated the vast void around him which thereafter a huge pressure domain came into effect.

“What a strong oppressive force, it’s indeed worthy of being a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He felt the oppressive force from the Golden Light Domain was much stronger than his own Star Armor Domain and Prison of Punishment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He believed he would be able to suppress an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God or above in a duel using the Golden Light Domain. It would even work on someone like Saber Master.

In addition, the Golden Light Domain was not the only domain oppression Jian Wushuang had.

He had yet to display his other secret techniques like Star Armor Domain, Prison of Punishment, and Sword World.

“Golden Light Domain is a domain treasure. The Star Armor Domain and Prison of Punishment are both part of secret techniques. The Sword World is a principle oppressive force. Although I have four types of oppressive methods, they don’t conflict with each other and can even be superimposed on each other!” Jian Wushuang excitedly held his hands together.
