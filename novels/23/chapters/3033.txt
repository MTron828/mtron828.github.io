Chapter 3034: Entered the Secret Manual Again

—— Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. A total of nine realms.

The Heavenly Curve World.

Inside a towering hall in the middle of a densely packed group of buildings made up of countless palaces and pavilions.

“Supervisor Xiao, my Palace Master said that this conflict is purely caused by the Sword Alliance taking the initiative to stir up trouble. That’s why the Heavenly Void Alliance retaliated directly. Even if your people were all killed by the Heavenly Void Alliance, it’s their own fault. However, Supervisor Xiao, you’ve now gathered an army at the border of our heavenly void world and made an aggressive stance. Why? Don’t tell me that the Sword Alliance wants to start a war with our Heavenly Void Palace?” A brown-haired elder with a childlike face stood in the hall, his expression was cold and filled with anger, and his words were loud and clear.

Beside him were many experts from the Sword Alliance. They looked at the white-haired elder with a child-like face with ice-cold eyes, and some of them even carried killing intent.

At the top of the great hall, a woman in purple armor stood there.

This woman’s appearance was extremely beautiful, but she was extremely cold and arrogant. Her eyes were cold and did not contain the slightest bit of sympathy. There was also an ice-cold and… murderous aura between her brows!

Yes, it was the murderous aura!

This murderous aura was very strong, and everyone in the hall could clearly feel it.

However, what was surprising was that the aura on this woman’s body was not very strong. She had barely reached the level of a Divine Master. The people below were all Great Divine Masters and above. However, it was this kind of woman that emitted the murderous aura, that caused many Great Divine Master level experts below to not even dare to raise their heads.

“Hmph, starting a war? So what if I want to start a war?” The voice of the woman in purple armor was ice-cold, it reverberated throughout this palace, “Go back and tell the Heavenly Void Palace Lord that I need him to give me an explanation for this matter. Also, I don’t have that much patience. Three months, three months later, if he doesn’t give me an explanation, the army of experts from my Sword Alliance will directly cross the border and enter the Heavenly Void Palace’s territory.”

“Supervisor Xiao, aren’t you going too far? What kind of status does my palace master have? Why would he give you an explanation?” That white-haired elder with a child-like face shouted in a low voice.

“Your Palace Master’s status?”

“Hehe, back then when my young master was around, your Palace Master didn’t even dare to appear in front of my young master. With just a word from young master, that Heavenly Void Palace Master didn’t even dare to utter a fart. Now that my young master has left, he immediately jumped up. What a joke!”

“What a joke!”

“Listen carefully. Even if my young master is no longer around, the Sword Alliance is still not something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can easily bully. At the very least, a mere Heavenly Void Palace Master does not have the qualifications to do so!” The purple-armored woman shouted in a low voice.

“You!” The white-haired elder pointed at the purple-armored woman. His eyes were burning with anger, but it was not good for him to flare up.

“Blood lamp, chase this old thing out. If he dares to say any more nonsense on the way, kill him immediately and send his head back to the Heavenly Void Palace Master,” the purple-armored woman shouted.

“Yes.”

Divine Master Blood Lamp immediately walked up from the great hall and chased the white-haired elder out.

The white-haired elder did not dare to get angry again, afraid that Divine Master Blood Lamp would really kill him.

The other experts in the hall reluctantly raised their heads to look at the purple-armored woman, but they quickly lowered their heads.

Obviously, they were all in awe of the purple-armored woman.

Although the scene just now happened in the hall, it was witnessed by one person from beginning to end.

This person was Jian Wushuang.

He was in the void not far from the buildings, and his soul power had already covered this place.

“Xin ‘er, this girl is really good.” Jian Wushuang secretly praised her.

The purple-armored woman in the hall with great majesty and killing intent was his maid, Xiao Tiexin.

He had killed Realm Lord Tianqu and occupied the tianqu world. Then, he moved the Sword Alliance he created to this place.

Under his tyrannical methods, the Heaven Curve World completely respected the Sword Alliance.

After that, there was a huge change and he had no choice but to leave the Golden Crow Nine Realms. When he left, he also sent a message to Xiao Tiexin, telling him a few things.

After that, he did not know what happened.

But now, it seemed that Xiao Tiexin’s methods were extremely powerful. Even without his deterrence, he still managed the Sword Alliance and the entire Heaven Curve World in an orderly manner. The experts in the Heaven Curve World were filled with reverence toward him.

The Sword Alliance was even more powerful because of the corpse puppet army that he had left behind. The only thing that it lacked was probably that there was no Immortal Saint in charge of it.

However, the Golden Crow Nine Realms had the rules set by Bone Emperor, so no one dared to violate them. It was very difficult for the forces of the other realms to invade the Heaven Curve World.

For example, the Heaven Void Palace would be defeated this time.

“Xin ‘er is probably more skillful than Yin Su’er of the red stone castle,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He only came here to understand the current situation of the Sword Alliance, but he did not show up and did not send a message to Xiao Tiexin and the others.

Xiao Tiexin and the others did not know that he had returned.

After all, when those mysterious experts from the third firmament had descended, some of those experts had looked for Xiao Tiexin and the experts under him. If nothing went wrong…Xiao Tiexin and the others must have been soul-searched by someone with powerful means and all their memories had been read.

Only when they were certain that Xiao Tiexin and the others did not know his location, could those experts let them off.

However, they probably let them go to catch a big fish.

If Jian Wushuang’s guess was correct, Xiao Tiexin and the Divine Masters under the Sword Alliance who were close to Jian Wushuang must have left a special mark on their bodies. Once Jian Wushuang appeared in front of them, the mark would be triggered, the experts hiding in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow would immediately detect him and come to kill him as soon as possible.

Therefore, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang to contact Xiao Tiexin and the others, let alone appear in front of them.

After having a certain understanding of the Sword Alliance, Jian Wushuang returned to the Pill Sun Sacred World.

The Pill Sun Sacred World did not change much. Jian Wushuang only took a look at Crimson Rock Castle, and then he went straight to the secret realm.

The entrance to the secret realm was here.

It was not Jian Wushuang’s first time here, so he was naturally familiar with it.

Soon, he opened the passage of the secret realm and entered the secret realm.

Entering the secret realm and breaking through the obstacles in front of him, Jian Wushuang arrived at the true core of the secret realm in less than 15 minutes. At the same time, he saw the spirit of the secret realm again.
