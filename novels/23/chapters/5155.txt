The passionate words spoken by Chishui might have convinced those who didn’t know his character. First, he confronted Demon Lord Fengyu, and now he used all the forces within the alliance as a shield. If he truly intended to fight against Emperor Fengyu, he could have just gone out and faced her, so why bother returning to the main hall?

In their hearts, everyone cursed silently, but outwardly, they had to praise the righteousness of their leader.

This scene amused Tongtian Buddha and Zhen Wuyang.

Indeed, he was a peak tier 4 Emperor, capable of handling any situation flawlessly.

This maneuver made Tongtian and Zhen Wuyang secretly determined – they would never collaborate with Chishui no matter the circumstances.

His shamelessness surpassed the sum of their own.

Great Si Region didn’t have many strong individuals; there was only Zhen Wuyang, who couldn’t be considered a significant force. He was fine.

Tongtian Buddha was different; he ruled over 3,000 Great Worlds and had dozens of Emperor-level experts under his command. Although Dongyan and Wuliang each led their own faction, the overall situation was now irreversible. They couldn’t stir up any waves.

Dongyan had fallen, and the Dongyan Realm naturally fell into his hands. Wuliang was considerably weaker and also needed him.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, he could consolidate his power, but all of this hinged on Qishen Temple being the primary force.

Behind Chishui, six tier 4 Emperors appeared, two of whom were at the peak of tier 4.

Facing Demon Lord Fengyu alone, he only had a 10 percent chance of winning but a 100 percent certainty of escaping with his life. Even though he wasn’t afraid of Demon Lord Fengyu, he couldn’t let the others in the Chishui Alliance sit back and watch.

“Brother Chishui, we’re here to help you!” several Emperors spoke up, their words respectful, yet their disdain for Chishui!s actions was evident.

“Demon Lord Fengyu, don’t think we small forces are easy targets.”

Following this, several tier 3 Emperors appeared one after another, standing behind Chishui and the few tier 4 Emperors.

The powerful figures from the Eternal Tower emerged, observing the situation. Several tier 4 Emperors and dozens of tier 3 Emperors appeared behind Demon Lord Fengyu, exuding immense pressure. Although these Emperors were displeased with Fengyu’s sudden action, she was the ruler of the Eternal Tower. At this moment, they had to intervene to maintain order.

“Fengyu, hold on!” Chishui suddenly called out, easing the tension among the crowd.

With the Qishen Temple right in front of them and no benefits gained yet, no one wanted a conflict at this moment. A battle involving so many powerful beings would undoubtedly result in casualties. The cultivation path of Emperor-level experts was arduous, and nobody wanted their own people to perish, let alone themselves.

In the chaotic brawl of so many powerful beings, even a tier 4 Emperor could accidentally fall, not to mention the tier 2 and 3 Emperors. As for the ordinary tier 1 Emperors and Grand Yan Immortals, they didn’t even have the ability to participate in the fight.

In battles among powerful Emperors, the residual might of their clashes could annihilate them. They didn’t have the right to participate, let alone to watch.

Fengyu glanced back at her own allies, sensing that they also preferred to avoid conflict for now. She softened her tone. “Chishui, what else do you want to say?”

“Fengyu, everyone knows we will have to fight sooner or later. But before we do, it’s best if everyone picks a side,” Chishui said, casting a glance at Tongtian Buddha, Zhen Wuyang, and others who had already joined his alliance.

The crowd inwardly cursed at his cunning nature. They knew this old man had ulterior motives.

However, his words caught Fengyu’s attention. Fengyu also glanced at the crowd, especially focusing on Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha. Peak tier 4 Emperors were exceedingly rare, numbering less than ten in the entire one-fourth of the universe in the Eastern Domain.

They represented the absolute pinnacle of power. Particularly since the tier 5

Emperors were absent, the Eternal Tower couldn’t rank at the forefront of peak forces. The main reason was the absence of a tier 5 Emperor. If they could now win the allegiance of two amazing tier 4 Emperors, they could easily suppress the Chishui Alliance in future conflicts.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“In that case, everyone, state your allegiance. If you are willing to join the

Eternal Tower, you are most welcome. My Master will return soon, and the Qishen Temple’s fate will ultimately be decided by the tier 5 Emperors. You all should think it over carefully,” Fengyu warned, her words laced with both threat and caution.

The powerful figures from the Eternal Tower emerged, observing the situation. Several tier 4 Emperors and dozens of tier 3 Emperors appeared behind Demon Lord Fengyu, exuding immense pressure. Although these Emperors were displeased with Fengyu’s sudden action, he was the ruler of the Eternal Tower. At this moment, they had to intervene to maintain order.

Not only were they speaking to Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha, but they were also trying to shake the confidence within the Chishui Alliance.

For them, a tier 5 Emperor was like a god, an irreversible existence. If they ended up with nothing in the end and offended a tier 5 Emperor, it was better to join the Eternal Tower early on.

“Hmph!” Chishui snorted coldly, looking somewhat embarrassed as he glanced at Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha, and then at the strong individuals within the Chishui Alliance.

“l won’t hide it from you all. Chang Shentian of the Northern Domain has already contacted me secretly. They still have a position for a Grand Guest Officer. I could join them at any time, but I chose not to,” Chishui said with a touch of generosity in his voice. He continued loudly, “Which one of us isn’t a pride of heaven? Cultivation is not easy, and we still have to endure the oppression from those peak forces. Don’t let their sweet talk deceive you.”

“If you join these peak forces now, you will be cannon fodder. Even if the tier 5 Emperor returns and seizes Qishen Temple, do you really believe they will share the spoils with you, the younger generation without background or strength? Don’t dream. Opportunities are seized, not distributed.”

Wanderer Chishui’s angry shouts actually frightened some ambitious solitary Emperors.

However, most of what he said was true. Joining peak forces at this time meant becoming cannon fodder. Even if they obtained Qishen Temple in the future, the tier 5 Emperor would pick first, followed by a bunch of juniors. They wouldn’t stand a chance.

Although Demon Lord Fengyu was a regional leader, she wasn’t very articulate. Seeing this situation, she could only briefly describe the power of the tier 5 Emperor to pacify them.

But the stronger the tier 5 Emperor was, the more they feared, afraid that they wouldn’t even have the ability to resist in the future.

Zhen Wuyang considered quietly. He had no faction, no background, relying solely on his own strength. Joining the Eternal Tower at this moment seemed like a wise choice. With his strength, he was second only to Demon Lord Fengyu in the Eternal Tower. Even if he became cannon fodder, he still had the power to survive.

As for the Chishui Alliance, he didn’t consider it. Firstly, the distribution of benefits didn’t suit him, and secondly, Chishui was too unreliable, always ready to run away.

“Ruler Fengyu, I am Zhen Wuyang. I am willing to enter the Eternal Tower.” After careful consideration, Zhen Wuyang didn’t hesitate and directly bowed to Demon Lord Fengyu.

He even addressed her with the more flattering ‘Ruler’, rather than ‘Demon Lord’, which sounded more pleasing..
