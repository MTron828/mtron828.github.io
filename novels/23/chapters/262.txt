“Wilderness Sword Sect? ” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He might hesitate to launch an attack on other sects.

But he had a grudge against the Wilderness Sword Sect. During the Easternmost Hunting, Mo Lingtian wanted to strike him to death. Then in the Heartless Island, the experts of the Wilderness Sword Sect wanted to kill him. Now this sect followed Holy Emperor Palace.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was willing to attack the Wilderness Sword Sect.

“Well, I’m in.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “But what can I do?”

“This is a token. Take it and go find the Daluo Heaven Sect in the Northern Region in a month. You need to give the token to the Ninth Elder Ling Han. Then he’ll tell you what to do.” Wang Yuan smiled.

“Daluo Heaven Sect?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “OK.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“When are you going to leave?” Wang Yuan asked.

“I’ll wait until I get better,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“It’s OK. You just need to reach there in a month. I’ll order someone to give you a map of the Nanyang Continent. You might need it,” Wang Yuan said with a smile.

After staying in Mansion of Sword Marquis for a day, Wang Yuan left for Alchemy School with his underlings.

Jian Wushuang left the Tianzong Dynasty and started his real trip to train after a few days.

The young eagles spread their wings to travel into the vast sky.

...

A month later, it was still chilly, while snow covered the ground.

The Northern Region was located in the north of the Nanyang Continent and covered a vast land.

There were more than 100 Dynasties in the Northern Region. More than 10 of them were large empires. The Northern Region also had a powerful sect. This was one of the eight top sects, the Wilderness Sword Sect.

In recent years, experts and disciples from the Wilderness Sword Sect had not made any progress, so the strength of the sect had been going backwards, its position hanging by a thread.

In the Northern Region, there was another sect which could fight against the Wilderness Sword Sect. That was the Daluo Heaven Sect.

The Daluo Heaven Sect was at the peak of the mountains. Jian Wushuang with a Long Sword on his back was walking slowly on the road to the Daluo Heaven Sect. Deep footprints were left behind him in the snow.

“Momentum... lift heavy weights easily and shake heaven and earth.” Jian Wushuang was studying the manual his father gave him while walking.

The manual provided some tips about the Origin written by a top expert.

The manual mentioned Source Enlightenment was divided into three levels.

The first level referred to “Momentum”.

The second level referred to “Domain”.

The third level referred to “Pinnacle”.

Jian Wushuang started to comprehend World Origin and Slaughter Origin, so he had not reached the first level “Momentum” yet.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang stopped walking, with his Triple-kill Sword out of the sheath. Then he began to practice swordsmanship alone in the snowfield.

Shua!

The sword light was waving slowing, with little strength.

Every streak of sword light lashed out and made the snowflakes drift beside him.

At this moment, two figures were just flying over his head.

One of the two women looked less than 30 years old.

“We’re going back to the sect. You’d better behave yourself after returning. Although you didn’t make a big trouble this time, you’ve caused our sect some trouble. You’ll be punished, but it won’t be severe,” the white-clothed woman said.

“I know, senior sister. I’ll accept my punishment after returning to our sect. You’ve said many times along the road.” the green-haired maiden, less than 20-year-old, said and stuck out her tongue. Suddenly, she glanced at the ground and happened to see Jian Wushuang who was practicing swordsmanship in the snowfield.

“Senior sister, look, there’s a man who’s practicing swordsmanship.” The green-haired maiden cried out.

The white-clothed woman looked downward and could not help but raise her brows.

“Emm, the man looks very young. His swordsmanship is quite slow. I haven’t studied swordsmanship, but I know it’s quite ordinary.” The green-haired maiden curled her lip.

“Shut up.” The white-robed woman rebuked her. “You don’t understand. His swordsmanship looks slow, but every stroke is very delicate. I’m afraid that his strength is higher than mine.”

“What?” the green-haired maiden asked in surprise.

“It’s not far from our Daluo Heaven Sect. This man practices swordsmanship here. Does he want to come to learn kung fu?”?The white-robed woman could not help but think.

She thought the young expert of Sword Principle must want to join the Daluo Heaven Sect.

“Senior sister, this man’s Cultivation of Sword Principle is not weaker than yours?” The green-haired maiden looked toward her senior sister.

“I don’t know, but why not have a try?” The white-robed woman laughed and then moved downwards.

Jian Wushuang was absorbed in practice for a while, and then he stopped.

“Shake heaven and earth. How does it work?”?Jian Wushuang withdrew his sword and was still puzzled at it. The moment he raised his head, he just saw two women landing on the ground.

They were quite pretty, especially the white-robed woman. She was a great beauty, with black brows, big eyes, red lips, white teeth, and fair skin. Even Jian Wushuang could not help but praise her to the bottom of his heart.

Jian Wushuang was more surprised at their Cultivation.

The green-robed maiden was around 20-year-old and had reached the Initial Yin Void Realm; the white-robed woman was less than 30-year-old, but Jian Wushuang was not sure about her Cultivation, at least the Profound Yang Void Realm.

In the Tianzong Dynasty, it was almost impossible to see someone that had such Cultivation of Spiritual Power at her age.

“I’ve been a person living at the bottom of a well.”?Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

“I’m Jun Yi from the Daluo Heaven Sect.” The white-robed woman stood in front of Jian Wushuang and introduced herself modestly.

Jian Wushuang touched his nose and smiled slightly. “I’m Swordsman.”

“Swordsman?” Jun Yi frowned, but immediately said with a smile, “I saw you perform swordsmanship. You must be adept at Sword Principle and I’ve also studied Sword Principle, so I want to learn some moves from you. Would you like to spar with me?”
