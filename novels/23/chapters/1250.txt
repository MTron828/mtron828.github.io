The force was incredibly odd and unique, and Jian Wushuang was unable to stop it from entering into his body.

“Is this the curse that she spoke of?”

Jian Wushuang could feel the odd force brooding inside himself as he asked, “Gu King, can you get rid of this curse?”

“No, I can’t.” Gu King shook his head. “This level of curse needs to be dispelled by one that is highly skilled. It requires expertise above that of a Universe God. If there’s no one helping you dispelling it, you can only let it dissipate by itself. Considering that woman’s resentment, it’ll take at least hundreds of thousands of years for it to fade away.”

“Hundreds of thousands of years?”

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded, he did not want to stay in the Green Fire World for another hundreds of thousands of years to wait for the curse to dissipate before heading towards the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Jian Wushuang, you shouldn’t kill her. You could have suppressed her with your Blood Mountain Sword first and kill her when you grow stronger and don’t need to fear the Holy Prefecture behind her,” said Gu King.

“To wait till that moment?” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “How can the soul of the Sunrise Sword Emperor rest in peace if she does not die?”

Gu King was rendered speechless. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Now, Master’s ritual formation has fallen on this battlefield, and the woman from the Holy Prefecture has also been killed. Although a few Universe Masters from the Jin Kingdom managed to survive, they’re not be able to pose any threat to us. My Green Fire World will have a peace of mind and it’s time for me to head off to the Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

With these words, Jian Wushuang used his fastest speed to return to Green Fire Palace.

The moment he arrived at Green Fire Palace, he immediately mustered the other Palace Masters and told them his decision.

Knowing that Jian Wushuang was preparing to head towards the Eternal Chaotic World, Palace Masters felt surprised, but this thing was also within their expectations.

After all, Jian Wushuang was still so young, his potential was still far beyond imaginable.

If he continued to stay within the Green Fire World, it would waste his talent.

Besides the Green Fire World was in peace now. Jian Wushuang did not have to stay here.

Fifteen years after the end of the ultimate battle, numerous people gathers on the vast battlefield again to see Jian Wushuang off. Among them, there were Jian Wushuang’s parents, his friends Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou and many Palace Masters such as Tang Emperor, Palace Master Yun, Xue Lingtian and Emperor Xiao.

Many Holy Masters of the Green Fire Palace also came here.

“Father, Mother.” Jian Wushuang looked at his parents.

“Shuanger, in my whole life, my proudest moment is to have you as my son.” Jian Nantian smiled weakly at Jian Wushuang while feeling an immense sense of pride. His son was publically recognized and known as the leader of the Green Fire Palace and the one who had saved everyone during the ultimate battle.

He was also the most talented youth in the history of the Green Fire World!

“Shuanger, please be very careful.” Ji Wumeng looked warmly upon Jian Wushuang.

“Yes I know.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

“Tang Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang stood before Tang Emperor again and handed over a token to him, “This token contains 3 set of powerful sword skills. I’ve spent a long time refining and perfecting it. I want to hand it over to you now, in case of any emergency.”

Tang Emperor accepted the token and nodded heavily, “Jian Wushuang, this road to inverse cultivation will not be easy. You have to be careful with your every step. You must not follow in Xiaoqing’s footsteps.

“Eldest Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang came to Xue Lingtian. “Master may have gone but he put a lot of effort into creating the Ancient Sect. Please take care of the Ancient Sect after I leave.”

“Don’t worry. The Ancient Sect will be alright with me around.” Xie Lingtian laughed.

“Uncle Xiao.” Jian Wushuang came to Emperor Xiao. “I’ll definitely bring Shuanger back from the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“Alright, be careful.” Emperor Xiao nodded slightly while beaming with confidence towards Jian Wushuang.

Lastly, Jian Wushuang came to his three good brothers.

“Haha, the three of you…”Jian Wushuang looked at them.

“Third Brother.”

Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang, feeling a little down.

“That’s enough. We’ll meet again. Soon, I’ll be back here drinking with all of you.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Of course.” Wang Yuan, Yang Zai Xuan, Su Ruo nodded their heads.

Sadness was a natural part of a farewell.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had no regret.

“Everyone, goodbye!

“The Green Fire World, goodbye!”

Jian Wushuang cupped his hands in front of himself to bid farewell to everyone before turning around to leave for the faraway void. Over there, Palace Master Yun had already made a portal for Jian Wushuang to access the outer world.

Under the gaze of everyone, he entered the portal and soon disappeared.

Underneath the dark sky, a portal appeared out of nothing, and a figure flew out of the portal rapidly.

“Woosh!”

Jian Wushuang managed to stop himself, looking quite haggard.

After he stabilized himself, he turned to look back.

“Wow, is this the spacetime storm that wraps up my Green Fire World and the huge battlefield?”

Jian Wushuang looked into the distance and saw the completely distorted spacetime.

That distorted spacetime was extremely big and seemed boundless. Although he was far away from it now, the sight still filled him with awe.

A spacetime storm in the Eternal Chaotic World indicated a disaster.

Such a huge spacetime storm was no doubt a catastrophe.

However, it was also because of the dreadful spacetime storm, no one else dared to get close to this place and the Green Fire World could occupy the battlefield for all this time.

If the experts of the Jin Kingdom had never been drawn into this spacetime storm by accident, they would have never discovered the battlefield.

“In a sense, this spacetime storm is like a protective shield to my Green Fire World, so actually my Green Fire World should be thankful for its existence.” Jian Wushuang laughed weakly.

“Jian Wushuang, you have to remember the location of this spacetime storm clearly. If there’s nothing else, we’ll set off,” said Gu King.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly as he waved his hand to summon a spaceship, which appeared out of nowhere.

To travel in the Eternal Chaotic World, one could not simply rely on his or her legs. Taking a spaceship is the best way of getting round in this world.

The spaceship Jian Wushuang summoned was originally from Dao Yuanzi.

He sat on the spaceship and sped away, excitedly.

“The Eternal Chaotic World, I am…coming!”
