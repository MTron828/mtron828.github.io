Chapter 1889: Let Imagination Run Wild

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Just as they saw the arrival of Jian Wushuang and the others, everyone who was in discussion in the void immediately became quiet.

Jian Wushuang sat at the highest place as he glanced at all Almighties in front of him with a sharp gaze.

The Almighties, including the three Emperor Gods, couldn’t help but feel a tinge of fear when their eyes met Jian Wushuang’s. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Similarly, they had fighting powers of an Emperor God. However, Jian Wushuang had reached the peak of Emperor God and those who could match evenly were just a handful.

The few Emperor Gods at the scene were too far apart with Jian Wushuang.

“Everyone, I think you have received the news,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, “That’s right. The Master of Star Palace has passed away and he passed away three thousand years ago. After he passed away, I became the newly appointed Palace Master in Lineage of Star.”

The Almighties were silent and no one spoke.

“Actually, everyone should be mentally prepared for this outcome, right?” Jian Wushuang looked around.

The Almighties were surprised but no one denied it.

The news about the Master of Star Palace’s death was a widespread rumor for very long. It was just that it wasn’t verified.

They naturally knew the news. Hence, before they accepted Lineage of Star’s invitation, they were well prepared.

Then, the news was verified to be true.

“Sword Emperor!”

There was suddenly a thick voice. There was a three-meter-tall, mountain-like brawny man that stood up among the crowd.

The brawny man was Emperor God Xuan Wu, who was extremely strong in defense.

“Sword Emperor, don’t worry. As we accepted Lineage of Star’s invitation previously, we definitely won’t go back on our words. No matter what Lineage of Star has been through, we will definitely be by Lineage of Star’s side. I won’t say we would risk everything for Lineage of Star but we would definitely go all out,” Emperor God Xuan Wu said.

“Yes, we would definitely go all out as a meager contribution for Lineage of Star!”

The Almighties stood up one after another and expressed their standings.

The Almighties that Hall Master Yuan invited had great reputations and they were men of integrity.

Jian Wushuang smiled at the sight.

“If so, thank you, everyone,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Everyone, don’t worry. Lineage of Star is different from before. Even when the Master of Star Palace passed away, Lineage of Star wasn’t someone who could threaten as they wish. As long as everyone works together, we should be able to deal with any danger.”

“Alright everyone, let’s get prepared.”

Jian Wushuang waved and beckoned for the Almighties to be dismissed.

Just then…

“Hold on a second!”

There was suddenly a low voice.

Jian Wushuang and everyone at the scene looked to the source of the voice subconsciously.

There was a man in a black robe that revealed a malicious smile.

“That’s Sir God Bei Han. There was no problem with his reputation. However, his character is the worst of all, and he is relatively more selfish,” Hall Master Yuan sent a message in silence.

“Selfish?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but he looked calm on the outside, “I wonder how can I help you, Sir God Bei Han?”

“Sword Emperor, from what I know, many years ago, the Master of Star Palace once massacred wantonly in Eternal Chaotic World. Hence, he offended many enemies, including many major forces. Those enemies were mostly killed by Sword Emperor in?recent years. But the major forces are still here,” Sir God Bei Han said.

“Previously, when the Master of Star Palace was here, he could serve as a deterrent force to all the major forces. But now, the Master of Star Palace died and many of the forces might team up to exterminate Lineage of Star. Although Lineage of Star is powerful and there’s the Sword Emperor attending garrison duty personally, I’m afraid it would be very difficult to withstand so many forces simultaneously.”

“It’s very difficult. However, Lineage of Star isn’t as simple as it looks. If there were to be a war, we could fight against the forces,” Jian Wushuang said calmly, “Plus, if we really fail to do so, everyone could leave when it comes to a hopeless situation. We, Lineage of Star wouldn’t stop nor question you. Sir God Bei Han, you don’t have to be worried.”

“Even so, if Lineage of Star were to really be exterminated, Secret Skill of Star Palace would definitely be in the hands of the forces. By then, it would be impossible for us to get Secret Skill of Star Palace from the hands of the forces. In other words, we will fight a tough war alongside Lineage of Star but we won’t get any benefit at all,” Sir God Bei Han’s voice sounded rather evil.

The moment he said that, there were many people whose expressions changed.

Among the Almighties, there were many who came for the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Lineage of Star had promised that they could receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace if they were to serve Lineage of Star for ten thousand years.

However, just as Sir God Bei Han had pointed out, if in the upcoming war, Lineage of Star were to be exterminated, who could they get Secret Skill of Star Palace from?

They fought for Lineage of Star but wouldn’t get anything in the end?

That wasn’t something they wanted.

“Sir God Bei Han, what are you trying to say?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Sir God Bei Han.

“I only want to give Sword Emperor a suggestion,” Sir God Bei Hand said.

“What suggestion?” Jian Wushuang remained composed.

“Very simple. Before the war, which is now, let us inherit the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Then, not only will we fight Lineage of Star with our all, most importantly, with Secret Skill of Star Palace, we also could give full play to our trump cards. When we perform our trump cards, we could also increase Lineage of Star’s winning chances. Isn’t it a perfect plan for both parties?” Sir God Bei Han said.

Hearing what Sir God Bei Han had said, the surrounding Almighties’ faces changed.

There were a few that stole glances at Sir God Bei Han. Actually, they had had the same idea as Sir God Bei Han but they didn’t dare to bring it up.

Jian Wushuang looked indifferent but his heart grew gloomy.

“You want to get the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace now? Sir God Bei Han, you thought great,” Jian Wushuang sneered, “The war has yet to start and all of you have yet to do anything for Lineage of Star, but you want to receive the rewards and benefits? That’s a joke!”

“Forget that it would be a life-and-death war, even if it was a simple mission, have you ever seen that one could get all the rewards and benefits for completing a task before completing it?”

“In this world, would there be such an amazing deal?”

“Sir God Bei Han, are you sure you’re not letting your imagination run wild?
