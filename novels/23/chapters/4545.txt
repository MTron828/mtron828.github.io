4548 Setting up an Array

The Great Catastrophe War.

In the Divine Power Universe, it was a secret that only spread among the top-tier powers, and it was the same in the Void Universe.

Logically speaking, with Luo Ming’s strength, he was qualified to know about the Great Catastrophe. However, Luo Ming’s social relations were too poor and he had always been at odds with the top sects who knew about the news. Therefore, no one would naturally tell him.

The red-robed elder knew this.

!!

Therefore, he was also quite curious about how Luo Ming knew about the Great Catastrophe War.

Of course, Jian Wushuang already had an answer to this.

He raised his eyebrows and deliberately put on a nonchalant look. He pursed his lips and said, “What’s wrong? You’re the only ones allowed to know? There are many men in Crimson Whale Gangg who have informed me of this matter long ago.”

The red-robed old man could not help but nod with a bitter smile.

Although Crimson Whale Gang consisted of a bunch of small fry with few capable of taking on major responsibilities, they did have many members. It was not difficult for them to gather information.

“Luo Ming, I haven’t seen you for tens of millions of years, but you still speak with a sharp tongue,” the red-robed old man said with a sigh.

Before Jian Wushuang could answer, the middle-aged man, Void Master Hei Dao, sneered and replied, “So what if you know? What do you want to do now that you know? Do you really think you’ll be able to participate in the Great Catastrophe?”

Jian Wushuang also sneered and replied, “It’s not up to you to decide whether I will participate in the battle or not. I think you’re a busybody.”

“You!” Hearing this, Hei Dao venerable was furious.

The red-robed old man saw that the two of them were about to quarrel again, so he quickly put his hand on his forehead and said, “Alright, everyone, be quiet!”

Jian Wushuang and Master Hei Dao looked at each other, then snorted and stopped talking.

Taking a deep breath, the red-robed old man said, “Now is the time for our Void Universe to use people. Whether Luo Ming can participate in the battle is not up to the two of you, nor me. Wait here for a moment. Let me ask the master who is in charge of guarding the camp this time, Void Master Ba Huang.”

With that, the red-robed old man looked at the two of them and strode into the Void Forbidden Land.

After the red-robed elder left, Jian Wushuang relaxed a little.

There was no need to continue acting. They just had to wait for the results.

Therefore, he simply closed his eyes and looked down, turning a blind eye to Master Hei Dao’s fiery gaze.

…

The 87th crack in the Void Forbidden Land was completely sealed.

Among the densely packed palaces, there was a side hall with a few oil lamps.

The first batch of main forces of the Void Universe had already followed Cosmos God and entered the Divine Power Universe.

However, they still sent an expert to suppress the main camp in case of emergency.

A white-robed middle-aged man was sitting cross-legged on a futon, cultivating quietly.

Behind him, endless corpse Qi appeared automatically, forming a scene of mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

He was Void Master Ba Huang, the previous Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, and the person in charge of guarding the camp this time.

“Lord Ba Huang,” the red-robed old man quickly walked in and first respectfully called out softly.

Although Void Master Ba Huang was ranked at the bottom of the 34 Void Masters because they were all powerful figures who had been revived from the ancient times, he still had great prestige for Void Warriors who had not entered the Six Scar level.

“Hong Fo, what’s the matter?”

Void Master Ba Huang slowly opened his eyes and glanced at the red-robed elder. His tone was still polite.

Although the red-robed old man had yet to enter the Six Scars, he had been in the Five Scars level for tens of thousands of void eras. In terms of cultivation time, he had been in this realm for even longer than the Void Master Ba Huang.

However, on the path of cultivation, one’s strength was not determined by cultivation time, but by experience.

“Lord Ba Huang, Crimson Whale Gang’s Luo Ming has come to join us. He wishes to contribute in this upcoming Great Catastrophe War,” the red-robed old man said respectfully.

“Luo Ming? Is he the famous galactic pirate?” Void Master Ba Huang raised an eyebrow.

“That’s right, this is the person. Lord Ba Huang, I’ve known this Luo Ming for over a hundred void eras. Although he’s a little stubborn at times, he’s not weak and he’s not bad,” the red-robed old man said.

“Is that so?” Void Master Ba Huang rubbed his chin and smiled. “Then Hong Fo, you can decide for yourself. Let him see if there are any other cracks that need to be guarded and send him to guard them.”

For Void Master Ba Huang, it was not a big deal to arrange for Luo Ming. Moreover, the red-robed elder had just said that he was on good terms with Luo Ming, so he would do him a favor.

“Yes!”

The red-robed old man was slightly overjoyed and cupped his hands in gratitude toward Ba Huang.

In the dark of the Void Universe, countless people called this battle the ‘Battle of Deification’.

This was because if they won this battle, they would receive a reward from Lord Void God.

This was a rare opportunity.

Luo Ming could be considered as one of his best friends. The red-robed old man naturally hoped that this good friend of his would also be able to get such an opportunity. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After bidding farewell, the red-robed elder returned to the Void Forbidden Land.

“Luo Ming, come with me. Lord Ba Huang has already agreed to your request. I’ll bring you around to familiarize you with the Void Forbidden Land first. After that, I’ll find a place with weaker defense and let you take over,” the red-robed old man said with a smile.

“Hahaha, Hong Fo, you are the best.” Jian Wushuang laughed loudly and did not say any polite words. Instead, he reached out his hand and hit the red-robed elder’s chest heavily.

He triumphantly glared at the middle-aged man, whose face was terrifyingly dark. Then, he followed the red-robed elder and strode into the Void Forbidden Land.

“A small man intoxicated by success.”

The middle-aged man grunted in anger and sat back down. He closed his eyes and began to cultivate.

No one noticed that Jian Wushuang, who was following closely behind the red-robed elder, had a faint smile on his face.

A small black flag slipped from his sleeve and inserted itself into the void. Then, it disappeared without a trace.

Only Jian Wushuang could sense that the nearby void had been suppressed by the Fengtian Flag. With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the Fengtian Flag could be fully activated and seal off everything, forming a forbidden land!

...

“Luo Ming, I’ll bring you around the Void Forbidden Land first. I’ll also tell you what the situation is like in this Great Catastrophe War,” the red-robed old man walked in front and said.

Jian Wushuang had the same intention. When he heard the red-robed elder’s words, he was moved and nodded.

“Alright,” he said.
