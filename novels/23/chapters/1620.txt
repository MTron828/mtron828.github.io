Chapter 1621: Not Acknowledged

“Royal Ancient God!”

“No wonder he’s so remarkable!”

“Another Royal Ancient God has been born in the Gu King City.”

Many Ancient Gods on the martial arts training ground looked at Jian Wushuang with respect.

The Ancient God Clan had always revered those with abilities and specific Bloodlines. Under normal circumstances, a Gold-armored Ancient God was considered the highest level of Ancient God Bloodline.

As for a Royal Ancient God… there were not many of them in a Great King City. If they were to grow up in the future, they could definitely become the King of a faction.

Hence, the birth of every new Royal Ancient God would be a joyous occasion within the King City. As such, the Ancient Gods present were also delighted.

Except King Gu Yi, whose face did not have any slightest bit of happiness. Instead, his face was ice-cold.

He was a Seven-star Royal Ancient God. Hence, he was a super expert who was strong enough to compete with the Almighties of the human beings.

While other Ancient Gods could only tell that Jian Wushuang had the Bloodline of a Royal Ancient God, King Gu Yi could tell that Jian Wushuang also possessed the Bloodline of a human being.

In other words, Jian Wushuang possessed a Bloodline mixed between Ancient Gods and human beings.

“I did not expect someone among the people with a Mixed Bloodline of Ancient Gods and human beings to actually be able to awaken a Royal Ancient God Bloodline,” King Gu Yi was staring at Jian Wushuang.

After hearing what was said, the Ancient Gods present were shocked.

“Mixed Bloodline?”

“Gu Jian possesses a Mixed Bloodline? Moreover, it’s a Mixed Bloodline with human beings?”

“A Mixed Bloodline has actually become a Royal Ancient God?”

The Ancient Gods present, including the golden-haired youth, started to change the way they looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Gu Jian, right?” King Gu Yi looked down at Jian Wushuang and his eyes were cold, “You can go back now.”

“Go back? Then the Ancient God Palace…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Hmph, a Mixed Bloodline like you wishes to go into the Ancient God Palace?” King Gu Yi gave a cold hum.

The eyes of the surrounding Ancient Gods were filled with coldness as well.

“As expected,” the King of Venomous Worms sighed, “After so many years, the rules of the Ancient God Palace have not changed at all.”

“King of Venomous Worms, what is going on?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Jian Wushuang, I told you before that the Ancient God Clan reveres the Bloodline. Moreover, the purer the Bloodline, the more respected they are. If you were a pure Royal Ancient God, not to mention joining the Ancient God Palace, it would also be easy for you to build a lineage that belonged to you. However, it’s a pity. Not only do you possess the Royal Ancient God Bloodline, you are also a human being. Hence, you are a Mixed Bloodline between Ancient Gods and human beings. Within the Ancient God Clan, this kind of Bloodline is not acknowledged!” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Not acknowledged?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“That’s right. It does not matter whether it is a Mixed Bloodline between Ancient Gods and human beings or a Mixed Bloodline between Ancient Gods and other clans. As long as the Bloodline is not pure, and thus incomplete, the person will not be recognized by the Ancient God Clan. Moreover, the Ancient God Palace has had a rule since a long time ago saying that Mixed Bloodlines will not be able to enter the Ancient God Palace,” the King of Venomous Worms continued speaking, “As I left the Lineage of Ancient Gods for too long, I do not know whether the rules of the Ancient God Palace have changed. Hence, I decided to let you participate in the Ancient God Palace’s assessment!”

“If the rules have changed, that would be best as you would be able to enter the Ancient God Palace openly to cultivate the Three Secret Skills and Four Unique Skills!”

“However, if the rules have not changed, you can also fake your way in. After all, it is impossible for a normal Ancient God to notice your Mixed Bloodline except for Seven-star Ancient Gods and above. Moreover, there are also very few Seven-star Ancient Gods in the Gu King City, and under normal circumstances, they should not be concerned with the matters in the Ancient God Palace.”

“Therefore, I decided to let you sneak into the Ancient God Palace to get your hands on the Secret Skills and Unique Skills. After getting your hands on these skills, we can leave immediately and those Seven-star Ancient Gods might not take notice at all. Even if they were to realize it, they could only give you some punishment at best and you would just have to take it.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That is what I thought. However, who would expect you to be discovered by a Seven-star Ancient God even before sneaking into the Ancient God palace.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “Then we can only leave now, right?”

“Leave? Hmph, since you have passed the assessment, how can we leave so easily?” the King of Venomous Worms said with a cold voice, “Since we are unable to enter the Ancient God Palace to cultivate those Unique Skills and Secret Skills by normal means, we can only do it the hard way.”

“The hard way? How can we do it the hard way?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

It should be known that the person in front of him was a Seven-star Ancient God. Moreover, the Gu King City was filled with numerous experts. Hence, what could a Five-star Ancient God like him do?

“Jian Wushuang, tell King Gu Yi that you wish to challenge the Star Moon Tower,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Moon Star Tower? What is that?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Don’t ask so many questions. Just follow what I have said,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Alright.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He raised his head at once and looked toward King Gu Yi, who was in front of him. He then said, “My Lord, I wish to challenge the Star Moon Tower.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the void of the martial arts training ground froze instantly.

All the Ancient Gods present opened their eyes wide and looked at Jian Wushuang. Their eyes seemed as though they had heard something impressive.

Even King Gu Yi revealed a shocked expression.

“What did you just say?” King Gu Yi stared at Jian Wushuang.

“I said that I wanted to challenge the Star Moon Tower,” Jian Wushuang repeated himself.

“Haha~~~” King Gu Yi laughed loudly straight away, “Little kid, you really dare to say anything. For many years, no one has had the courage to challenge the Star Moon Tower. Yet, you wish to challenge it? Do you know how the word ‘death’ is spelt? Looking at the fact that you were able to awaken the Royal Bloodline, I would advise you to leave quickly, if not…”

“I have already made up my mind,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

King Gu Yi squinted his eyes slightly and looked at Jian Wushuang deeply, “Great, since you wish to die, I shall grant you your wish. The Star Moon Tower will be open in ten days. If you have the ability, go ahead and challenge it!”

After his speech, King Gu Yi swung his robe sleeves and left.

As for those Ancient Gods present, all of them were looking at Jian Wushuang with mixed feelings. Some of them were shocked, some of them revered him, some of them sneered at him and some of them looked at him as if he were an idiot.

“Gu Jian.”

The golden-haired youth walked in front of Jian Wushuang and he was filled with mixed feelings, “Although you are a Mixed Bloodline who is unable to be recognized by the Ancient God clan… I, Gu Zhen, admire your courage and resolve to challenge the Star Moon Tower.”

“I hope that you are still able to remain alive after ten days.”

After his speech, Gu Zhen left as well.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. He ignored the unusual gazes of the people present and left.

At the same time, he was also questioning the King of Venomous Worms about the details of the Star Moon Tower.

He merely took the initiative to say that he wanted to challenge the Star Moon Tower and that he was extremely sure of it. However, in actual fact, he himself was unsure of what exactly the Star Moon Tower was.
