Chapter 2303 Lin Family

Zhuo Yunfeng gave up trying to get him to join the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion after multiple rejections from Jian Wushuang and with Luo Xinqin’s protection.However, Zhuo Yunfeng did not give up on trying to get Jian Wushuang to join a clan to get the best teachers.He felt that Jian Wushuang would only get the best training if he entered a clan.

No matter which clan he introduced to Jian Wushuang, he would be rejected firmly.

Zhuo Yunfeng felt extremely helpless. He scolded Jian Wushuang many times on how he had never made any effort to improve. Jian Wushuang ignored all of the scoldings.

Time passed quickly and soon, Jian Wushuang was twelve and he was still living in the Governor’s Palace within Incineration Moon City.

Jian Wushuang was twelve years and six months old. It was wintertime and snow was falling from the sky like the feathers of a bird. The entire Incineration Moon City was covered in a lining of white.

Within the Governor’s Palace, Jan Wushuang sat under a tree, holding a jade bamboo strip in his hands.

A sword skill had been recorded on the jade bamboo strip.

This sword skill was not difficult but it was also not easy. Jian Wushuang had been studying this sword skill for around three months.

Jian Wushuang finally put down the jade bamboo strip.

“After three months, I finally understand this sword skill. It is a pity that this sword skill is too low level. Even though it contains Spacetime Rules of Order, it is far too little. It does not help me in my understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly.

Over the past few years, Jian Wushuang had stopped studying the events and myths of the Absolute Beginning Divine World. He had been studying secret skills and honing his sword skills.

Zhuo Yunfeng was in the Half-Step Divine Demon Realm. He was considered a powerful expert within the Anjiu Prefecture. After all, there were not many Divine Demons within the Anjiu Prefecture.

On top of that, Zhuo Yunfeng was the governor of a city and had good relations with the Lin Family. Their foundation was solid as there were several types of secret skills and sword skills within the Governor’s Palace.

During the past few years, Jian Wushuang had already browsed and studied all of the secret skills and martial art skills.

The sword skill that Jian Wushuang had just put down was one of the sword skills he was interested in.

“Twelve years. I still need some time before I can get back to my prime. As for my understanding of the Sword Doctrine and Rules of Order, I have improved. However, this speed is far too slow. If I have sword skills of an even higher level for me to study or meditate on, I will improve faster,” Jian Wushuang muttered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The quiet Governor’s Palace suddenly became noisy.

Many footsteps could be heard from the front yard. Many of the maids and servants were rushing out.

“Xiao Man.”

Jian Wushuang stopped one of the maids who was rushing out.

“Prince.” The maid stopped and greeted Jian Wushuang.

“What is happening? Where are all of you rushing?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Prince. We received a message from the master that an important guest is here. Master is already on his way. He told us to prepare as well,” the maid replied.

“An important guest? Who is it?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“It seems like the head of the Lin Family is here,” the maid replied.

“Head of the Lin Family?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and understood why there was a ruckus.

Anjiu Prefecture was just one of the many prefectures within the Wusha Barren Region.

Even though it was only a single prefecture, it was gigantic. The size was about the same as the Green Fire World.

Within the Anjiu Prefecture, the most powerful was the governor of the prefecture, who was also a top-tier Divine Demon.

Below the governor, there would be six top-tier families within the Anjiu Prefecture. Each of these families was like an overlord within the Anjiu Prefecture. Each family would have around two or three divine demons. The most powerful two families now had four.

The Lin Family was one of the six top-tier families.

As the head of the Lin Family, he was the main pillar of support and was definitely an important figure. He was much more powerful than a small city governor like Zhou Yunfeng.

The reason why the head of the Lin Family was there at the Governor’s Palace of the Incineration Moon City was because of Jian Wushuang’s father, Zhuo Yunfeng. They were extremely good friends. Back when the head of the Lin Family had still been in the Chaotic Realm, he had ventured out together with Zhuo Yunfeng. They were brothers who had experienced life and death situations together.

Hence, Zhuo Yunfeng was on very good terms with the Lin Family.

“It is my father’s one-thousand-and-six-hundredth birthday tomorrow. The head of the Lin Family must be here to celebrate the birthday with him.” Jian Wushuang could guess the reason why the head of the Lin Family was here.

The Lin Family and Zhuo Yunfeng were brothers who went through thick and thin together. Every time something good occurred within Zhuo Yunfeng’s home, the Head of the Lin Family would send over a generous gift.

For example, when Jian Wushuang was born, the head of the Lin Family had sent a very generous gift.

The head of the Lin Family had been be free around this time and came down to attend Zhuo Yunfeng’s birthday celebration personally.

“Birthday... Back in the Eternal Chaotic World, everyone lives for a very long time and hence people tend to forget their birthday. In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, a cultivator will celebrate his birthday once every hundred years.” Jian Wushuang smiled to himself.

As the head of the Lin Family was there, his parents and the entire Governor’s Palace treated this seriously.

He did not care.

He whipped out another jade bamboo strip and started reading.

A figure in green clothes walked in from outside the garden.

Jian Wushuang looked up at the figure. It was a teenage boy who was around fourteen or fifteen years old. He wore expensive clothes and looked naive.

When the teenage boy stepped into the garden, he instantly spotted Jian Wushuang, who was sitting under a tree.

“Hi, little one. Where is Prince Jian Wushuang?” the teenage boy in green clothes asked directly.

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

Back in the Eternal Chaotic World, he had lived for nearly a hundred thousand years and people had called him an old monster.

However, the teenage boy was around fourteen years old. Even Zhuo Yunfeng, who had lived for one thousand six hundred years, was far younger than Jian Wushuang.

And this teenage boy was calling him little one?

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and replied without looking at the teenage boy, “Are you looking for something?”

“Of course. I heard that he was born because of swords. When he was born, a divine sword came down from the Heavens. I am also an expert of the sword doctrine and am unconvinced of how talented he is. Since I have finally received a chance to come to Incineration Moon City, I want to duel with him,” the teenage boy in green clothes said.
