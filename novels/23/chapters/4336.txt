4338 Five-Element Divine Lord

“What?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and immediately felt the strange phenomenon coming from the broken ancient bronze cauldron in his Interspatial Ring.

The broken tripod was the bronze tripod that Jian Wushuang had obtained after killing Qiu Long on the Ancient Path of Stars. It had a broken leg and was engraved with countless complicated and mysterious runes.

Speaking of which, after Jian Wushuang had obtained the bronze cauldron, he had spent a lot of time studying it. In the end, no matter how much divine power he had poured into it, the bronze cauldron had no reaction at all. The divine power he had poured in was like a clay ox entering the sea, unable to cause any waves.

!!

As time passed, Jian Wushuang no longer cared about it.

Unexpectedly, the ancient bronze cauldron, which had not moved for a long time, had a reaction in the Five Elements City!

“What’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang frowned and released his divine power to feel the Five Elements City carefully to see if there was anything different.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

“Yi wood Qi!”

He could feel that in the void of the five-element city, there were traces of faint yi wood Qi!

This second wood Qi was extremely thin. If he hadn’t killed the Twin River Rulers and activated the great array protecting the city, he wouldn’t have been able to sense it.

The Yi wood Qi was the connate Qi of the five elements before the universe was born.

At that time, the universe was filled with all kinds of five-element chaotic Qi. It was with these five-element chaotic Qi that the last layer of chaos gradually evolved into mountains, rivers, stars, and black holes, forming the current appearance of the universe.

The Qi of the five elements was further divided into innate chaotic Qi and acquired Qi.

What Jian Wushuang had felt just now was a very thin trace of innate wood Qi.

Before Jian Wushuang could think further, the countless figures that had soared up from the Five Elements Divine Sect had already landed and surrounded Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang.

On the sleeves of their white robes, there was an embroidered pattern of five elements. They were the disciples of the Five Elements Divine Sect.

They felt the divine power fluctuations of the Twin Rivers Rulers around them that had disappeared. Their eyes revealed a hint of shock and anger as they stared at Jian Wushuang.

However, they did not act rashly.

Not long after, he saw a dignified middle-aged man with a pair of thick eyebrows walking toward Jian Wushuang.

The middle-aged man’s expression was unsightly as he walked over. The disciples of the Five Elements Divine Sect stepped back automatically to make way for him.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked at the middle-aged man. The man’s cultivation was close to the level of an unparalleled Ruler. He was the most powerful expert in the five elements Star Domain according to his divine sense. Jian Wushuang knew without a doubt that this man was the sect master of the Five Elements Divine Sect, the Five Elements Divine Lord.

Looking away, Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm and he didn’t care. Not to mention the Five Elements Divine Lord, even if all the people in the five elements Star Domain were gathered together, they wouldn’t be enough to kill him with one stroke.

Although he was still at the Ultimate Ruler Realm, he was no longer someone a Ruler could compare to. His current opponents were only at the Divine Ruler Realm.

At the Ruler realm, he, Jian Wushuang, was invincible among all races!

As the middle-aged man approached, he sized up Jian Wushuang from head to toe. An imperceptible fear flashed in the depths of his eyes. Then, he took a deep breath and cupped his hands, “I’m the sect master of the Five Elements Divine Sect. You can call me the Five Elements Divine Lord. May I know how I should address you?”

Jian Wushuang nodded. He had already planned to massacre the entire five elements Star Domain. However, this person’s attitude was good. Jian Wushuang suppressed his killing desire.

“I am Jian Buqi, and this is my Dao companion, Ling Ruqing.”

“Lord Buqi, if I may ask, what was the reason for you to kill our great elder?”

The Five Elements Divine Lord said.

Jian Wushuang replied indifferently, “He offended me first. I killed him. What’s wrong with that?”

The Five Elements Divine Lord squinted his eyes when he heard that and said in a deep voice, “He didn’t abandon the Ruler, and he killed my sect’s Grand Elder just for the sake of offending him with his words. Isn’t it a bit inappropriate to just walk away like that?”

Jian Wushuang tilted his head and looked at him with a faint smile, “So, you’re here to seek justice for him?”

The Five Elements Divine Lord’s pupils shrank when he heard that. He stared at Jian Wushuang closely and thoughts flashed through his mind.

He wasn’t a stupid person. Since Jian Buqi could kill the head elder with a single palm strike, it was enough to prove that Jian Buqi’s strength was definitely not below his!

After weighing the pros and cons, the Five Elements Divine Lord said, “How about this, undying Ruler? Let’s bet three moves. As long as you can withstand three of my moves, the Five Elements Divine Sect will respectfully send you off. We’ll then forget about the matter of the great elder and never mention it again. If you can’t take it…”

The Five Elements Divine Lord’s gaze turned cold. “Then I’m sorry. I’m afraid you and your cultivation partner will have to stay in the Five Elements Divine Sect’s prison forever.”

“Oh?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked interested and said, “Sure, but I want to raise the stakes.”

“Additional stakes? What do you mean by that?”

The Five Elements Divine Lord was puzzled.

Jian Wushuang stretched out his finger and pointed at the Five Elements Divine Sect, which stood in the center of the Five Elements City. He said, “If I lose, you can take my life. However, if you lose, I need to take something from your Five Elements Divine Sect.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This…”

The Five Elements Divine Lord hesitated for a moment before he nodded heavily. “Sure.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Good.”

He could feel that the wisp of chaotic innate yi wood Qi He had just sensed in the Five Elements City came from the Five Elements Divine Sect!

Although he didn’t know why the damaged ancient bronze cauldron would suddenly move after encountering the chaotic innate yi wood Qi, he was very sure that the way to open the ancient bronze cauldron might be related to the chaotic innate yi wood Qi!

“Let’s start.”

Jian Wushuang collected his thoughts and said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, the disciples of the Five Elements Divine Sect who were surrounding him stepped back and made a large empty space.

“Go, sect master!”

“Let this person pay for the great elder’s life!”

...

“One move! The sect master can defeat this person in one move!”

The disciples of the Five Elements Divine Sect cheered.

“Be careful, my husband.”

Leng Rushuang said with a little concern.

“I’m fine.”

Jian Wushuang smiled at her. Then, he turned to look at the Five Elements Divine Lord and said, “Come.”

“Good! Sword doesn’t abandon, then you take it!”

The Five Elements Divine Lord took a deep breath and raised his right hand.

In an instant, countless divine powers surged and condensed into a five-colored ball of light with a terrifying aura in his hand!

The Five Elements Divine Sect cultivated the five elements Qi as the foundation of their great Dao. Within the five-colored ball of light, the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were constantly changing. Among them, the green wood Qi was especially rich!
