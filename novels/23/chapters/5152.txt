Chapter 5155 - 5155: Cunning Chishui

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Don’t be fooled by the multitude of forces now aligning with him, forming the Chishui Alliance. Once a fifth-tier Emperor appeared, these people would scatter faster than birds in flight. Currently, they only sought to vie for power through him. He lacked a clan and faction, but his personal strength was substantial, earning him the admiration of many factions.

After all, his individual capability was limited, making him easier to control. If successful, they could let him make the initial choice. In the end, the spoils of war would be divided based on numbers.

Most factions within the Chishui Alliance shared this mindset. Even if Chishui desired monopoly, they had the strength to resist.

Chishui, who was known for his cunning schemes, found himself in a tight spot this time. This was a situation he couldn’t outmaneuver; he had to face it head-on.

If there wasn’t a dominant force at this moment, even if he was a fourth-tier peak Emperor, he wouldn’t gain much among these many strong contenders. The key was to align with a dominant force to counterbalance other peak forces.

He understood this well; it was mutual exploitation between the parties.

However, when it came to dividing the treasures at the end, it might spark a massive free-for-all. At that time, there would be no allies. Everyone before him could be slain.

In the pitch-black void crevice, Wu Zuo sat cross-legged atop the head of the

Black Qi Snake. This Black Qi Snake was a puppet granted to him by the Qishen when he achieved the sixth-tier Emperor status.

Unfortunately, it had suffered significant internal damage and lost its former strength. In its peak state, he could have repaired it. However, restoring its sixth-tier power required numerous treasures, especially considering the severe damage to its divine body. These treasures weren’t something he could find within the universe; his only hope lay within the Qishen Temple.

Being able to participate in this trial was not in vain. Once his power was restored to its peak, few in this river domain could match him. With the Qishen’s inheritance, he could aspire to the pinnacle of the universe.

Watching the constant quarrels among these native Emperors, he found it somewhat amusing. After all, the Qishen Temple was something they could break into – just a bunch of ants.

When the Qishen Temple was originally forged, he had witnessed several gods under Qishen destroying an entire universe, extracting its source, and

The source of an entire universe – that kind of power was unimaginable. Even the Universe Masters needed several of them to extract it intact. If destroyed, a single Universe Master could achieve it. The challenge lay in extracting it intact without damage.

The power of the source was the core of the universe, and the core of the Qishen Temple was also a similar source, surpassing multiple universes. What the Emperors entered was merely an outer hall; there were no valuable treasures inside. The only useful thing was probably its source.

There were many outer halls in the Qishen Temple, each containing a miniature source.

These source powers were hatched from the core source of the Qishen Temple. Within the source, the Qishen Dao was also contained. To Wu Zuo, directly cultivating the Qishen Dao was the most foolish method.

Moreover, these people claimed to be the 18 divine generals and the 108 envoys, which, in Wu Zuo’s opinion, was incredibly ignorant.

The Qishen Temple was indeed guarded by three main gods, 18 divine generals, and 108 envoys. However, to obtain their inheritance, one needed the strength of a fifth-tier Emperor, at the very least.

In the present, the divine envoys appointed by these natives were all at the Perfected Nine Revolutions level, with many even achieving the status of Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals level.

They inherited the source contained in the outer hall, arrogantly attempting to grasp the pathways of the major gods and messengers, aiming to reach the pinnacle. It was utterly ridiculous.

If one could truly ascend to the universe’s peak by merely grasping the surface of the Qishen, which was barely present in the outer hall, even the Qishen itself would marvel at this person’s enlightenment. Unfortunately, he had fallen. If he hadn’t, perhaps even the Qishen would have bowed to him as a teacher.

Amidst the people’s arguments, they failed to notice a superpower sneering at them in the void’s crevices. This superpower was also the only living disciple of Qishen.

“Fengyu, don’t be so absolute in your words,” Wu Zuo lowered his voice amidst the cacophony. “God-Emperor Zhutian has been absent for so long. Even if he rushes back now, even with instantaneous movement all the way, it would take a million years. If we use precious treasures for teleportation, it would still take tens of thousands of years. If we enter now, it’s paving the way in advance for the God-Emperor. If you don’t provide useful information now, in case we encounter danger inside, it will be a significant loss for His Divine Majesty.”

Wu Zuo cleared his throat, his eyes shifting as he spoke in a hushed tone, “Or should I say, His Divine Majesty shared information about Qishen Temple with you, and you kept it hidden privately!’

Indeed, his voice was hushed, but all the major Emperors present, even the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, clearly heard this statement.

If mere mortals had been present, it might not have been audible.

However, the person in that seat was no ordinary individual. Even if the voice was as faint as a mosquito’s buzz, it was still distinguishable as originating from there.

Moreover, this statement came from Chishui, a peak tier 4 Emperor. The words spoken by an expert of such stature could be considered law in many smaller worlds.

Especially that last sentence, it practically let outsiders know.

If they truly didn’t want others to hear, a simple barrier could completely isolate them, silencing the words.

Upon hearing these words, regardless of belief, a chill settled into the hearts of all. Regardless of whether anyone trusted her, she was now isolated.

Even the Emperors of the Eternal Tower found their trust in Demon Lord Fengyu wavering.

Though these individuals were overlords in their own realms, exceptional beings among countless geniuses, before the grandeur of the Dao, they were just as fragile.

Human nature thrives on comparison. Hearing this statement, whether they believed it or not, everyone would inevitably compare themselves. If they were in Demon Lord Fengyu’s shoes and possessed certain Qishen Temple-related information, like how to gain entry, would they divulge it to others? This was a philosophical aspect of the path of seeking the Dao.

Might rules alone!

In just one word, the stronger one became, the lonelier they were. This kind of loneliness manifested itself in the ruthlessness displayed when competing for opportunities.

Demon Lord Fengyu was a Demon Lord precisely because she disdained these despicable acts. If she could kill someone, she would never utter another word.

“Chishui, you’re seeking death!”

Swish!

The boundless power of the Eternal Tower shot out from Demon Lord Fengyu’s palm, instantly transforming into countless towering figures suspended above Chishui’s head.

“I’ll say it once. Master has not responded to anything related to Qishen Temple.” A hint of killing intent leaked from Demon Lord Fengyu’s delicate face.

Merely from appearances, it was hard to imagine that this slender girl suppressed all the major forces in the Eastern Region.

“Who knows!” Chishui retreated into the alliance hall.

“Rest assured, since I have been recommended as the alliance leader by all of you, I will naturally protect you all. Just stand behind me. Today, 1 want to see how strong this Demon Lord Fengyu really is and how powerful the Eternal

Tower’s might can be..”
