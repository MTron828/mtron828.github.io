Chapter 1582: Fighting Against An Eternal Real God

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Die, boy!”

An angry roar spread across the universe. Real God Xue Wu, who was giving out a soaring aura, had an ancient silver hammer in his hand.

A silver hammer looked just as huge as a mountain and it was unusually heavy.

Real God Xue Wu held the hammer with one hand and he revealed himself in silver armor. He turned into an unrivaled warrior and pierced through the air before him to charge against Jian Wushuang directly.

Jian Wushuang put his divine power to full play too as light shimmered in his eyes.

“I’d like to see just how strong an Eternal Real God is!”

With boundless excitement, Jian Wushuang plunged forward too.

Two flowing lights collided instantly head-on.

To meet force with force!

“One Stroke of No Regrets!”

Hong!

A soaring sword intention that seemed to remain until death instantly swept out. It was as though it was going to break heavens.

The void became still and cold.

“Hammer Down!”

Real God Xue Wu wielded his huge hammer and he was going on a stronger offensive than Jian Wushuang.

The silver hammer slammed down from the void and the power had yet to be on full display. However, there was already a huge hole in the void.

It seemed as though the entire sky was going to break.

Bang!

There was an earth-shattering noise. Just as the noise echoed, there was instantly a boundless ripple of divine power that swept out.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew distressed. Just as the huge, silverr hammer hit his Blood Mountain Sword, he could clearly feel a bolt of power transmitted. The power went through weakening by Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor and hit his divine body. It caused his energy and blood to churn in him. The hand that was holding Blood Mountain Sword went numb too.

Jian Wushuang’s body fell back from the attack. He fell back for a few hundred miles until he regained steadiness again.

“Such strong power!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

Although they were all Real Gods, an Eternal Real God who was on the second stage was much stronger compared to a Void Real God who was on the first stage.

Merely in the aspect of divine power explosion, they definitely won hands down.

“Real God Wu Xue, I’m afraid he has yet to give his all,” Jian Wushuang said.

At that very moment, Real God Xue Wu, who was in silver armor and had rage soaring into the air, took a huge stride, wielded the ancient silver hammer, and charged at Jian Wushuang again.

The boundless aura pressed over like billowing waves.

“I am not his match to meet force with force.”

“However, when two parties fight, power is not the only factor.”

Jian Wushuang smirked and suddenly moved.

A total of ninety-nine shadows were cast simultaneously.

Every one of them was swift in action like a ghost. They moved around the void easily to charge against Real God Xue Wu. Even Real God Xue Wu couldn’t determine which one of the shadows was the real Jian Wushuang.

“This martial art motion?”

Looking at the crowded shadows that flooded in, Real God Xue Wu was shocked.

Vroom!

A faint, air-piercing noise was heard. It was soft but Real God Xue Wu heard at the first instance.

“Behind me!” Real God Xue Wu focused and turned around suddenly. He happened to see the stroke that Jian Wushuang was going to stab through his heart from the back.

“Go away!”

As Real God Xue Wu bellowed, the huge, silver hammer in his hand turned into a bolt of silver lightning and struck.

The silver lightning broke the void and exploded Jian Wushuang’s body before him with ease.

“Shadow?” Real God Xue Wu’s face stiffened.

“Your speed is too slow.”

There was a cold voice next to Real God Xue Wu’s ears. Then, there was a shrill stroke that hit Real God Xue Wu’s silver armor all of a sudden.

The silver armor was a Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure, which was extremely strong in defense. Under the attack of the sword light, there was a faint silver light. Real God Xue Wu only took one step back and he immediately stood still. Just as he was going to counter-attack, Jian Wushuang’s body disappeared before his eyes again.

“This young man’s martial art motion is too creepy,” Real God Xue Wu creased his eyebrows. Then, his body quivered and there were four muscular arms that extended out of his body suddenly. He had six arms then and every one of them was holding a hammer.

“Six arms?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Kill!” Real God Xue Wu roared and instantly pounded forward as his six arms waved.

Jian Wushuang had already put his martial art motion to full play. However, although his martial art motion was creepy, Real God Xue Wu moving his six hands at the same time could safely endure the attack that Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion attack. Plus, every counter attack could corner him.

“I won’t waste time with you!”

Real God Xue Wu’s eyes suddenly turned cold and there was a tall ancient shadow that appeared behind him out of nowhere. The ancient shadow looked like an exotic beast but also like a giant. The appearance was vague. Then, As Real God Xue Wu opened his mouth, the tall ancient shadow opened his mouth too.

“Roar!”

An earth shattering roar suddenly reverberated in the air.

The furious roar brought about terrifying soundwaves that shattered the surrounding void, while Jian Wushuang, who was around Real God Xue Wu, had no choice but to block the impact of the soundwaves by putting his hand before him. As for the ninety-nine shadows, they vanished into thin air with the attack of the sound waves.

“Young man, I found your real body.”

Real God Xue Wu lifted the corner of his mouth and laughed malignantly. His cold gaze locked onto Jian Wushuang.

The very next moment, he took a huge stride.

In his six arms, the six hammers gave out billowing power. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Just like a warrior descending.

“Eighteen Heavenly Fires!”

Under the drive of strong divine power by Eternal Real God, the six hammers were thrown out ferociously at the same time.

A strike followed closely by another.

In an instant, there was a total of eighteen strikes. On average, every arm threw out three strikes.

Every strike had the power to kill an ordinary Void Real God easily.

They were eighteen continuous strikes but they struck at Jian Wushuang at almost the same time.

“It’s Eighteen Heavenly Fires!”

“It is Mister Xue Wu’s strongest unique skill!”

The few Real Gods from Four Symbol Mansion looked shocked.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang concentrated and there was a boundless sword intention that soared up. It was as though it was going to tear heaven and earth apart.

Then, he wielded his longsword ferociously too.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The tremendous noise reverberated in the universe.

Every loud clash, every collision made the surrounding void Real Gods gulp.

They knew clearly that, if they were to encounter such collisions with their power, they would most likely not survive.
