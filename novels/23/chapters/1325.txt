“Son, you only got stronger by a slight bit and you thought I couldn’t deal with you?”

The Master of Golden-sun Sect roared. He spoke then, and an ancient and bold aura soared up in the air. On the Master of Golden-sun Sect’s right palm, a strong golden light flowed and it was harsh on the eyes. The right hand of the Master of Golden-sun Sect slapped.

“Emperor Print!”

Rumble!

A boundless golden light immediately formed a huge golden palm. The golden palm brought.

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly. His Soul Power had swept out long ago and he could clearly feel that the golden palm contained a terrifying power.

“Although I’m stronger than him in terms of strength, I’m far behind in terms of unique skill,” Jian Wushuang sighed. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He became Universe God and had a tremendous improvement in power. Both his divine power and divine body had gone through a huge transformation.

But on unique skill, there wasn’t much difference. The strongest unique skill that he created was only Test Wrecker, which was only a beginner rank two unique skill.

Then, the unique skill performed by the Master of Golden-sun Sect, its power was a Peak rank two unique skill.

Their difference in unique skill was too vast.

“I can’t win against him with a unique skill. I have to rely on other measures to compensate for the difference!” Jian Wushuang’s glare turned cold. He flipped his hand and a golden calabash appeared in it.

Swoosh.

An enormous amount of blaze quicksand flowed out and formed a boundless desert that covered the entire battlefield.

The Master of Golden-sun Sect, including the emperor-like handprint that he created, was covered by the quicksand.

The terrifying realm pressure spread across directly.

“What?”

The Master of Golden-sun sect was angry, “How is this possible? How can my power be suppressed by fifty percent?”

Fifty percent!

Yes, the Master of Golden-sun sect’s power was actually suppressed by fifty percent.

The power of the humungous handprint that he had pulled was suddenly weakened by fifty percent.

Most of the people watching the battle noticed.

“The Blaze Quicksand realm was triggered by divine power. The stronger the divine power, naturally the more ridiculous the power that was triggered. Although Jian Wushuang was just a Universe God in the First Heaven, his diving power was not any weaker compared to a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven. To trigger realm with such divine power, even I, a Universe God in the Third Heaven, might be affected slightly too. Hence, for a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven to be suppressed within the Blaze Quicksand realm, and to have his power suppressed by fifty percent, is actually quite normal,” the Master of Dayu Palace smiled faintly.

The Blaze Quicksand realm was already very impressive. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have borrowed it from Jian Wushuang previously.

Then, Jian Wushuang became Universe God and his divine power increased tremendously. When he triggered the realm again, the power was naturally far stronger than before.

On the battlefield, after the formation of blaze quicksand realm posed great oppression to the Master of Golden-sun Sect, there was an enormous amount of red flame that soared up from Jian Wushuang’s body. The red flame suddenly formed a sea fire around while Jian Wushuang was the emperor among the sea fire.

Scarlet Kingdom was performed straight away!

The blaze quicksand realm was used to oppress the opponent while Scarlet Kingdom was used to increase his power significantly.

Jian Wushuang merged the two techniques together perfectly.

Then, Jian Wushuang drew his sword.

“Buzz!!!”

A cold sharp noise broke out across the sky.

There was a sudden eye-catching sword light that caught everyone’s attention.

Jian Wushuang played the strongest stroke that he had created, Test Wrecker!

With the aid of Scarlet Kingdom, the sword gave out an earth-shattering power. The very next moment, it collided with the huge handprint face-to-face.

Rumble!

A vigorous rumble and the universe shook.

After the loud noise, Jian Wushuang, who was among the sea fire, suddenly stumbled and took a few steps back. But he steadied himself soon enough.

“So strong!”

There was a tinge of terror in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, “I am much stronger than him in strength. Plus, I’ve used both Blaze Quicksand Gourd and Scarlet Kingdom’s realm and even performed my strongest Sword Principle. But I am still at an absolute disadvantage?”

Although Jian Wushuang was shocked, he understood the situation.

They were too vastly different in unique skill after all!

“Jian Wushuang, you merely created a beginner rank two unique skill. You are still slightly behind if you want to be evenly matched with the Master of Golden-sun Sect. Wait till you create an advanced rank two unique skill, then you should be able to fight face-to-face with him and not fall behind,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Advanced rank two unique skill?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

A beginner rank two unique skill had been created. Hence, an advanced rank two unique skill naturally shouldn’t be too far away for him.

In the void before Jian Wushuang, the Master of Golden-sun Sect stood there while his face grew grave.

“Although my full blow shook him off, he wasn’t injured at all. There wasn’t even any weakening of his aura?” The Master of Golden-sun Sect looked glum. A simple exchange of blows and he understood that he can’t possibly kill Jian Wushuang.

Even if he could defeat Jian Wushuang, he wouldn’t be able to kill him.

“That’s it.”

Suddenly, there was a voice.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that appeared right in the middle of the battlefield and stood in between Jian Wushuang and the Master of Golden-sun Sect.

Looking at the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang getting involved, Jian Wushuang and the Master of Golden-sun Sect naturally ceased.

“The Master of Golden-sun Sect, Universe God Jiu Hai, I know that you bear deep-seated hatred towards Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang gave both of you a chance and you didn’t seize the opportunity. From today onwards, the two of you – including the forces under your control – should not find trouble with him. Otherwise… Without him taking action, I will not be polite to any of you,” The Master of Dayu Palace spoke coldly.

“Yes.”

The Master of Golden-sun sect and Universe God Jiu Hai nodded.

The two of them didn’t show any unwillingness. On the contrary, they held great gratitude towards the Master of Dayu Palace.

Because the Master of Dayu Palace got involved with resolving the matter, it helped them too. With Jian Wushuang’s talent, if he were to hold a grudge against them, things definitely wouldn’t end well.

As for the resentment between them and Jian Wushuang…

In this world, the strong will forever be the Master!

Jian Wushuang gave them a chance to take revenge but they couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang. So, who can they blame?

“Alright. This has ended. Dismissed.” The Master of Dayu Palace waved his hand.

The surrounding Universe Gods heard, then they bowed before the Master of Dayu Palace and left one after another.

Of course, even after they left, whatever they saw that day would definitely be their topic of conversation for quite some time. They believed that it would also stir a commotion in the entire Dayu World because of what happened.

After all, Jian Wushuang just underwent a God’s Test that everyone found unbelievable!
