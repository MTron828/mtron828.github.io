Chapter 3786: The Heart of the Astral World

“No?”

Jian Wushuang was confused and unwilling to accept this.

He had gone through a lot of trouble to pass through Heaven-Treading Mountain to get the iceheart glazed jade, but now Lord Wu told him that he did not have it. How could he accept this.

“I can see that you need the iceheart glazed jade very much.” Lord Wu looked at Jian Wushuang deeply, but then he smiled. “You don’t have to be nervous. There is no ice-heart glazed jade in the Red Cloud World, but there is something in the Red Cloud World that can replace it. It’s even better than the ice-heart glazed jade.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked at him immediately.

“Little guy, you want the ice-heart glazed jade so that you can reshape someone’s divine body, right?” Lord Wu asked.

“Yes, for my wife,” Jian Wushuang answered immediately.

“No wonder.” Lord Wu understood. “The ice heart glazed jade can reshape a glazed body. The glazed body can be molded at will. However, the glazed body itself is not a very good physique. After it is molded, it will be the same as an ordinary cultivator. At most, it will have a slight advantage.”

“But in the Red Cloud World, there is a special treasure that is also used to create divine bodies. It is called the heart of the Astral World.”

“The heart of the Astral World?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

It was the first time he had heard of this treasure.

“As the name suggests, the heart of the Astral World is the core of an astral world. It contains the essence of an astral world for billions of years and has incredible effects. It is easy to create a divine body with the heart of the astral world. In terms of potential, the divine body created by the heart of the astral world is much stronger than the so-called glazed body.”

“Under normal circumstances, if a cultivator absorbed the stellar heart, he would easily become a Ruler and even become a Supreme Being. The stellar heart contains the endless essence of an astral world, including the vast life force of the astral world. Therefore, if a divine body is formed with the stellar heart, the life force of the divine body formed will be extremely strong. The recovery of the divine body will be many times faster than that of an ordinary cultivator,” Lord Wu said.

......

Hearing Lord Wu’s words, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The heart of the astral world contained endless life force.

Moreover, after a cultivator absorbed the heart of the astral world, he would have great potential and become a Ruler easily?

The heart of the Astral World was amazing.

It was many times stronger than the glazed ice jade.

“Shuang ‘er’s strength is too weak. I was worried that even if she had the glazed ice jade, she would need to cultivate step by step to become a Principles Master, let alone a Ruler. But if she could get the heart of the astral world, it would be much easier.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, he was extremely excited.

“Lord Wu, can I exchange the reward for passing the Heaven-Treading Mountain for the heart of the Astral World?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Exchange for the heart of the Astral World? You wish.” Lord Wu sneered, “Little guy, I have just told you the use of the heart of the astral world. You should be able to hear that the heart of the astral world is a very rare treasure. It is extremely precious even in the vast universe.”

“After all, the Astral World Heart is the core of an astral world. During the process of Astral World Evolution, it is protected by the laws of the universe. No one can take it out. Only when an astral world evolves to the end and self-destructs will the astral world heart be left behind. Moreover, not every astral world that evolves to the end will leave behind an astral world heart. Instead, only when tens of thousands of astral worlds evolve to the end will there be an astral world heart left behind.

“Most importantly, the heart of the astral world will return to the universe after less than a month in the universe void. If no one finds it within a month or can’t take it with special treasures, then the heart of the astral world will be gone.”

“Because of this, the heart of the astral world is extremely rare in the universe, and its value is extremely expensive. Under normal circumstances, the entire wealth of a fourth-level or even fifth-level Ruler is not comparable to the heart of the astral world, and this is only the price of the heart of the astral world. But the heart of the astral world is too rare in the universe. Even if you can afford it, someone must sell it.”

Lord Wu’s words stunned Jian Wushuang.

Although he had guessed that the heart of the astral world might be valuable, he did not expect it to be so valuable.

Even the entire wealth of the fourth and fifth-level Rulers might not be as valuable as the heart of the astral world.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang frowned. “Lord Wu, although the heart of the Astral World is very precious, each of the 36 secret skills of the Red Cloud bloodline is enough to drive countless Rulers crazy. The value of these secret skills should be above the heart of the Astral World, right? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“At the very least, they should be more or less the same.”

“Mm. You are right. These thirty-six secret arts have been accumulated by the redcloud lineage over the course of countless years. Their value is immeasurable. Even a single secret art would be worth as much as the astral heart.” Lord Wu nodded slightly, but then, the conversation changed, “However, the trials and rewards of the redcloud lineage were all set by master when he was alive. Although master is now dead, no one can change the rules he set. Naturally, I can’t change them either.”

“If you pass the Heaven-Treading Mountain, then you can only get one of the thirty-six secret techniques, as well as the opportunities contained in the Second Heaven. You can also get it, but other things like the heart of the astral world can not be obtained through the Heaven-Treading Mountain. Of course, you can continue to work hard and think of a way to pass the Second Heaven’s test.”

“As long as you can pass the test of the Second Heaven, you can go to the third heaven and become an inner disciple of the Red Cloud Branch. According to the rules set by the master, an inner disciple can choose three treasures from all the treasures in the Red Cloud World. Then you can choose the heart of the Astral World as your reward,” Lord Wu said.

“Can I get the heart of the astral world only after I pass the Second Heaven?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly.

Jian Wushuang had already used all his skills to pass the First Heaven.

Although he had yet to pass the Second Heaven, he could imagine that it would be much more difficult than the First Heaven.

It would be impossible for him to pass it now.

“Little fellow, you don’t have to be too anxious. What you need to do now is to choose one of the thirty-six secret techniques and cultivate it. Then, you can use some of the opportunities in the Second Heaven to think of ways to increase your strength. Although the Second Heaven’s trial is a hundred times more difficult than the First Heaven’s trial, with your talent, you might be able to pass it in the future,” Lord Wu said.
