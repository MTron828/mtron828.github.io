Chapter 2638: The Scorpion King’s Invitation

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Void, two figures passed each other by repeatedly and a wave of terrifying energy swept out in a frenzy. They were in an apparently heated battle.

Qing Ze thought Jian Wushuang was only good at manipulating the sword formation to get close to him and that Jian Wushuang was no match to Qing Ze if they got into a close quarter fight.

Little did he know that he was wrong! As soon as he got close to him, he realized that Jian Wushuang’s close quarter combat skills were just as good. His understanding of Space-time Law and sword skills were extremely deep, he was not worried about his opponent getting close. When combining those abilities with the sword formation, he even caused Qing Ze quite a bit of anxiety.

There was nothing he could!

After a long intense fight, Jian Wushuang actually made Qing Ze realize that there was nothing he could do!

“Stop!”

Qing Ze suddenly distanced from him and Jian Wushuang paused he fight.

“I didn’t believe what Inspector Jin’s description of you—I didn’t believe what he said. Finally, I get to witness it myself.” Qing Ze looked at Jian Wushuang, rather stunned. “At Peak Earth Ultimate God’s level, you can already easily defeat a Peak Earth Ultimate God. And now that you’ve broken through Peak Earth Ultimate God, the power of your battle strength is actually comparable to regular Heaven Ultimate Gods, even I can’t do anything to you. I salute you!”

“You’re being too kind.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Jian Wushuang did not give all he had in the fight, nor did he utilize a lot of his tactics. However, the same could be said for Qing Ze.

They were merely testing each other out, there was no need to determine who the winner was, nor did they have to fight to death.

Even so, the fight was rather meaningful to Jian Wushuang, as he had a basic idea of where his battle strength was at.

“Inspector Jin.” Qing Ze looked unhappily at Jin Yihang, “You saw it. I simply couldn’t do anything to the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. I guess you’ll have to find someone else to teach him a lesson.”

Qing Ze smiled devilishly and left.

Jin Yihang’s face was full of embarrassment.

Indeed, he personally went to Qing Ze and tried many ways to trick him into agreeing to fight Jian Wushuang. His goal was to let Qing Ze teach Jian Wushuang a good lesson, just to vent his own dissatisfaction. However, not only Qing Ze had nothing on Jian Wushuang, he even sold him out in front of Jian Wushuang and the crowd when he left—revealing that it was Jin Yihang who asked him to come.

That was rather unethical to begin with, and on top of that, Qing Ze revealed it deliberately...

“Mr. Inspector.”

As expected, Jian Wushuang looked at Jin Yihang directly and said coldly, “You’re a respectable inspector from the Crimson Stone Fort, every word you said and every action you carry out represents the fort. How can you be so despicable?”

Jin Yihang shuddered but he could find no words to talk back.

“Let’s go,” said Jian Wushuang and went back to the camp with the Official Army commanders.

Jin Yihang stood in the Void, clearly sensing that many pairs of eyes looked at him in a strange way.

Many of those looks were from the Divine Demon miners and Official Army soldiers. There were also some Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Crimson Stone Fort.

The Heaven Ultimate Gods looked at him tauntingly in disdain.

That made Jin Yihang even more embarrassed. He could not stay any longer and left quickly.

On the peak not so far away, Scorpion King—who was in full battle armor and strong like a bull—smiled mysteriously.

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord...

“Never have I thought such an incredible genius exists in this tiny stellar region, very interesting.

“Crimson Stone Fort is in a terrible situation as it’s facing pressure from a few top powers from the outside. The factions within Crimson Stone Fort itself are a big threat to the Fort Master as well. At this moment, the Fort Master is in dire need to train some experts to support her. Although this Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is only an Earth Ultimate God, he is extremely gifted. It’s worth the effort to try persuading him.”

After mumbling a little, Scorpion King went back into the palace.

...

After Jian Wushuang returned to the camp, he dismissed Cang Heng and the rest and went back to the exquisite penthouse.

As soon as he arrived at the penthouse, he set up a restrictive shield, then flipped his hand and took out the smallest sized Royal Blood Gem, which was as tiny as a thumb.

“Royal Blood Gem...”

Looking at the Royal Blood Gem before him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes burned with passion.

“Although I don’t know the exact value of this Blood Gem, as the main material to cultivate Holy Treasure, it must be unusually valuable. The value of this little thumb-sized piece that I’m holding, which doesn’t weigh more than 10 pounds, must be beyond my imagination. I also possess one that is 200 pounds and another one 10,000 pounds, the total value must be...

“I’m rich, this time I’m going to be rich!”

Jian Wushuang was incredibly excited.

At that point, he did not need to cultivate any treasure, the Royal Blood Gems were of no use to him. Looking at it, Jian Wushuang could almost see countless Divine Elixir Pills that could help him break through his current level, making his ability increase drastically.

“No hurry, we’re still in the process of mining Royal Blood Gems, so I can’t leave for the time being. I need to wait till later, when the gems are all being mined and when the dust is settled, before I can find a chance to bring Royal Blood Gems to exchange for Divine Elixir Pills.” Repressing his excitement, Jian Wushuang calmed as soon as he could.

At the same time, he was slightly alert.

He knew he had made a fortune, but it was a windfall, which was supposed to be kept a secret.

As soon as people from Crimson Stone Fort or other powers knew that a little Territorial Lord obtained 10,000 pounds of Royal Blood Gem, there would be many who would keep an eye on him.

In the penthouse, Jian Wushuang gradually shut his eyes and began to cultivate himself.

The cultivation only lasted for a day.

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.” A resonant voice came above the campground.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and went up to the Void above in just a flash.

Glancing at the visitor, Jian Wushuang was stunned. “Mr. Qing Ze, why are you here?”

It was none other than Qing Ze, the man he fought a day ago.

“Haha, your ability is not below me, so nevermind the honorable addresses, just call me Qing Ze.” Qing Ze seemed to be very easy going. “Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, come with me.”

“Where to?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Master Scorpion King wants to see you, he asked me to bring you there,” explained Qing Ze.

Jian Wushuang was a little stunned.

Mr. Scorpion King—the Grand Ultimate God of Crimson Stone Fort—wanted to see him?

Perhaps it was because of the battle that happened? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although he was perplexed, Jian Wushuang still went with Qing Ze immediately.
