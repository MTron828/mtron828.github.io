Chapter 1913: Secret Skill of Real Dragon

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Your name is Jian Yi, right?”

Emperor God Tian Ling stared at Jian Yi as his gaze gradually burned with fire, “At first, I thought among Emperor Gods in this world, only Underworld God was qualified for me to go all-out. However, from what it seems now, it isn’t so.”

“However, that’s better too. After I defeat you, I will go and challenge Underworld God!”

The moment Emperor God Tian Ling’s comment spread, the surrounding crowd was surprised.

Challenge Underworld God!

In Eternal Chaotic World then, only Emperor God Tian Ling, who had improved tremendously, had the guts to make such a remark.

Vroom. A strange aura suddenly soared and there were huge dragon shadows that appeared behind him one after another.

Every one of the huge dragon shadows were big in size and they crowded behind him. In one glance, there seemed to be no less than a thousand of them.

Emperor God Tian Ling stood right in the middle among the thousands of huge dragon shadows, as though he was their ruler.

“Secret Skill of Real Dragon! When Emperor God Tian Ling wandered in ancient mystery world, he received an ancient secret skill, Secret Skill of Real Dragon!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It is said that the secret skill draw support from the power of real dragons in order to increase one’s power. The secret skill could only be cultivated and performed by Emperor God Tian Ling, who once absorbed a drop of real dragon blood essence. The others wouldn’t be able to cultivate it even if they obtain the secret skill. It could be described as Emperor God Tian Ling’s strongest secret skill!”

“The last time I saw Emperor God Tian Ling fight, there were only hundreds of huge dragon shadows when he performed the Secret Skill of Real Dragon. Now, he could substantiate over a thousand of them.”

Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, Emperor Gods who knew Emperor God Tian Ling, were surprised.

Emperor God Tian Ling was famous in Eternal Chaotic World and the Secret Skill of Real Dragon that he exclusively possessed was naturally well-known by the public as well.

Previously, Emperor God Tian Ling had fought with Qian Mingzi and Jian Wushuang, but he had never performed the secret skill.

But then, it was obvious that he felt pressure fighting against Jian Yi. Hence, he went all out and performed the secret skill.

Over a thousand huge dragon shadows substantiated behind Emperor God Tian Ling and Emperor God Tian Ling’s face was cold, like he was an emperor high above.

He gripped the spear in his hand tightly. Every move he took brought about the power of over a thousand huge dragon shadows.

“Fight!!”

A low roar and Emperor God Tian Ling took action.

The spear in his hand stabbed in the void in front of him. Then, the thousands of huge dragon shadows behind him roared simultaneously and shook the earth.

Hualala. The space broke and there was a whirlpool tunnel.

The spear shadow that contained the power of over a thousand huge dragon shadow went through the whirlpool tunnel and appeared before Jian Yi.

That terrifying spear seems to be able to shatter hundreds of millions of rivers and mountains.

Wherever that the spear shadow passed was left barren.

Looking at the spear shadow that plunged over, there was a tinge of chilly gleam in Jian Yi’s eyes.

His body had yet to move, but his palm slowly extended and pointed at the spear shadow that was flying over.

The moment he pointed, heaven and earth were distinguished!

A black light burst out.

Although the size of the light wasn’t huge, the power that it contained was terrifying!

Back in Green Fire World, when Jian Wushuang had fought with Jian Yi, he had also performed the same finger to Jian Wushuang. Although Jian Wushuang had blocked the hit with his all, he had still been injured.

Then, Jian Yi’s power was much stronger than before. His strength was also much more powerful than before.

The power of the point was given full play then.

Bang!

There was a terrifying bang and it was as though two worlds had collided ferociously.

After the loud bang, bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! There were a few other low explosions.

On the black spear shadow, the power of huge dragon shadows dispersed and the black spear quivered. Emperor God Tian Ling, who was holding the spear, couldn’t help but take three steps back.

Every single step was a tens of millions of miles apart. Every step caused a huge black hole in the boundless galaxy.

“Huh?” Emperor God Tian Ling creased his eyebrows and there was shock in his eyes.

He never thought that he would still have the lower hand when he performed Secret Skill of Real Dragon with his all to fight with Jian Yi.

“Again!”

Emperor God Tian Ling’s intention to fight increased tremendously. There was no one else in his eyes, there was no other battlefield, only Jian Yi alone.

He wanted to fight a battle with Jian Yi and win.

Jian Yi moved his body and immediately greeted his attack.

The two, who could easily suppress any other Peak Emperor God and could even be faintly compared to Underworld God favorably, were starting a fight in the middle of the battlefield.

The terrifying movements that they made shocked the surrounding people and no one dared to go any closer.

Looking at the scene, Jian Wushuang revealed a faint smile.

Jian Yi’s power didn’t disappoint him at all. The large amount of resources that he had spent all these years to help Jian Yi recover his power didn’t go to vain.

Emperor God Tian Ling was occupied with Jian Yi and he didn’t have any bandwidth. As for Lineage of Star, regardless of whether it was Jian Wushuang or Qian Mingzi, they were both free then.

Next…

“Elder Qian, how much fighting power do you have left?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Qian Mingzi had been severely injured by Emperor God Tian Ling earlier.

“Fifty percent,” Qian Mingzi replied.

“Fifty percent?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “In addition to the supporting power of the galaxy formation, that’s seventy percent. That’s enough!”

“Elder Qian, there are only two Peak Emperor Gods left in Star Extermination Alliance, which are Palace Master Wu Kuo and Number One Divine King. Let’s take action together to kill these two!”

“Yes,” Qian Mingzi nodded heavily.

“Die!”

There was a flash of murderous intention in his eyes and his body instantly burst out.

Just as they moved, Jian Wushuang resurfaced his seven heads and fourteen arms again. The four Hong Jun Golden Sword quivered and then appeared before Palace Master Wu Luo at the first instant.

“D*mn it!”

Looking at the four Hong Jun Golden Swords plunging at him, Palace Master Wu Luo’s face grew grave.

Even if it was in the outside world, Jian Wushuang’s four Hong Jun Golden Sword was enough to suppress him.

But then,?Jian Wushuang had the support of the galaxy within the galaxy formation. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had not only charged at him with four Hong Jun Golden Swords, but he had also charged at him in person.

“We were suppressed when we fought with him in a team of three. Now, one-on-one?” Palace Master Wu Luo’s face grew pale.

As for Number One Divine King, he was fighting with Qian Mingzi. Qian Mingzi’s fighting power was damaged. Hence, it was difficult to have the upper hand when he was fighting with Number One Divine King. However, Qian Mingzi didn’t have the lower hand either.

Number One Divine King tried to figure out a way to provide assistance to Palace Master Wu Luo.

It was obvious that Palace Master Wu Luo couldn’t match evenly with Jian Wushuang alone.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang was soaring with murderous intention.
