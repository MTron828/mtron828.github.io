Chapter 2384: Huge Changes

“How could this be right? Isn’t Miss Xiao the Second Miss of the Mu Clan?” Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were in disbelief.

“This world isn’t as simple as you think.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

He had lived for nearly a hundred thousand years in his previous life and had been through the thick and thin of life.

He had experienced all kinds of conspiracies, overt, and covert fights. He was not surprised to see what was going on with the Mu Clan.

“Hmm? The spacetime is sealed. It seems that you came well-prepared.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

“The space-time was sealed?” Xiao Heng and other disciples were shocked. They took out their message tokens immediately to transmit a message to their high-ups in Narcissus Island and realized their message could not be sent out. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The space-time was sealed. In his previous life, Eternal Chaotic World’s space-time was so weak that some Chaotic Realms could easily seal time-space. The same could not be said in Ancient God Domain. Under the Heaven Way’s will, space-time was strictly controlled. One must either be an expert of space-time law or apply a formation skill to seal space-time.

The Mu clan was obviously using the latter, which was the power of a formation skill.

“What a pity! If you make a move just now, there would not be any trouble at all. However, you’ve made the wrong decision and chose to remain here.” The gentle smile on the white-haired old man’s face had completely receded and was replaced by endless iciness. “Initially, we thought of merely using the forces of Narcissus Island to our advantage. We had never planned to go against you people, but things have changed now.” The white-haired old man was murmuring to himself. Even a stupid person would have known their intentions by now.

“So, the Mu Clan was merely using Narcissus Island to save Miss Xiao? Your real intention is to put her to death!” Xiao Heng’s voice was cold.

The white-haired old man snorted coldly. “Hmph! A lowly servant gave birth to her. How dare she think she could have a place in the Mu Clan? Dream on! She should’ve died more than ten years ago. For some reason, she was lucky. The people in the Hundred Flowers Tower didn’t kill her. Instead, they kept her and she gradually rose to fame. It wasn’t until recently that the Mu Clan learned that she is still alive!”

Since we have received such news, we have to find a way to completely wipe her out. After all, she is the Second Miss of the Mu Clan and we can’t overtly get rid of her. We had to pretend to want to rescue her and get help from Narcissus Island.”

She only has one final ending, which is of course death. It’s just a pity that you, fellow core disciples from Narcissus Island are going with her.”

Xiao Heng and his group of people were furious to hear about that. They had finally understood the conspiracies.

The Mu Clan never intended to rescue the Second Miss. They wanted to secretly get rid of her. The rescue mission was just a facade.

“Miss Xiao, don’t worry. We will not allow the Mu Clan to hurt you one bit!” Xiao Heng placed himself in front of Miss Xiao with his face flushed in anger. The four core disciples followed suit.

“You’re looking for trouble!”

The white-haired old man smiled wryly. He ordered as he waved his hand. “Kill them!”

Boom!

A dozen tyrannical auras simultaneously erupted. Besides the white-haired old man, the rest of the dozen experts from Mu Clan had started fighting.

A gush of divine power oppressed Xiao Heng and his people, rendering them unable to catch a breath.

“Protect Miss Xiao!”

Xiao Heng roared. His strength and power completely exploded and he immediately wielded it against the Mu Clan’s expert in front of him.

The four core disciples had also gone crazy.

With space-time being sealed, their messages could not be transmitted at all, hence it was almost impossible to escape. They could only fight with all their might for a survival chance.

“Go! Gol! Go!”

“Even if I had to die, I won’t let you hurt Miss Xiao!”

Xiao Heng and the other disciples were completely crazy and desperate.

“Brothers, take the Gu Blood Elixir!” Xiao Heng yelled while being engrossed in the fight before a pill appeared in his hand and he swallowed it.

The four core disciples looked determined. They also took out the same pill and swallowed it.

The Gu Blood Elixir was a kind of pill that could boost one’s divine power in a short period of time. The downside was that it carried a severe side effect. As soon as the pill’s effect wore out, one would fall into a period of weakness and needed a month or two to recuperate.

The pill was given to the core disciples of Narcissus Island to save their lives. Each core disciple was given one such pill and they could use it at a critical juncture.

The group of five had taken the Gu Blood Elixir. Even though they were only Third-Class Divine Demons, their combat power became terrifying as the elixir’s effect kicked in.

The four core disciples almost reached the level of Second-Class Divine Demons. The strongest of them, Xiao Heng, had spectacular swordsmanship. With the elixir’s help, he was at an advantage even when fighting single-handedly against two Second-Class Divine Demons.

The other four core disciples also used various skills to set up obstacles for the Mu Clan’s expert, stopping them from approaching.

“Jian Wushuang, take Miss Xiao away while we fight these Mu Clan’s experts!” Xiao Heng barked out the order.

He had no other choice but to place his hope on Jian Wushuang.

After all, he and the four core disciples had given their best to parry off the attacks from Mu Clan’s experts.

Only Jian Wushuang was able to freely move around and was the only hope in taking Miss Xiao away.

“Jian Wushuang, take Miss Xiao away now!”

The four core disciples were also screaming on top of their lungs.

Hearing those distraught voices, Jian Wushuang shook his head but did not move at all.

“How stupid!”

“This woman has bewitched them such that they are willing to sacrifice everything for her, even their own lives. Is it really worth it?” Jian Wushuang sneered as he peered at Miss Xiao who was next to him.

Miss Xiao was still covered with a veil, but she was shaking in fear. She looked all frightened and in trepidation causing many to want to protect her at the sight of her fearfulness.

“Miss Xiao, what do you think after seeing all my senior brothers who had fallen head over heels for you to the point of will to sacrifice their lives to protect you?” asked Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Master, what do you mean?” Miss Xiao met his gaze with a hint of mockery in her eyes. It was a different emotion from the fear she displayed a while ago.
