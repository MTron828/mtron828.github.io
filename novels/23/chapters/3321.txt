Chapter 3322: Sorcerer God

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

The person who came was an old man in a black robe. His face was gaunt as if he was just skin and bones. There was a pair of cold and strange pupils in his eye sockets that seemed to be about to sink in, and they were also emitting a faint green light, it was as if ghostly flames were dancing slowly, and a cold, strange, and evil aura spread out from his body. Anyone who met his gaze would shudder from the depths of their souls.

The moment they saw the black-robed old man, the first thought that came to everyone’s mind was fear and terror.

And this black-robed old man was the infamous sect master of the Sorcerer God Sect in the Divine Beginning Realm...the Sorcerer God!

The Sorcerer God commanded the Sorcerer God Sect. In terms of overall strength, the Sorcerer God Sect was not much weaker than one of the great Saint Realms. As the most powerful Sorcerer God, in terms of individual strength...it had always been rumored that he was not inferior to the three great Saint Realm Masters. However, this Sorcerer God was too mysterious and rarely fought personally, so no one knew exactly how strong he was. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But now, this Sorcerer God had appeared in person. Although he had not fought yet, judging from the aura he emitted, his strength should not be weaker than the three Saint Realm Masters.

“Keke, Flame Saint Master, we’ve known each other for so long, but this is the first time I’ve seen you being forced into such a sorry state. Moreover, you’ve been forced into such a sorry state by a little fellow at the Saint Realm.” The black-robed old man Sorcerer God’s gaze emitted a strange light as he looked at Flame Saint Master, a strange hoarse laugh also came out from his mouth.

“Hmph, don’t just stand there and say it like it’s nothing. If you have the ability, why don’t you come and exchange blows with this demon and see if your situation is much better than mine?” Flame Saint Master snorted coldly.

Sorcerer God raised his eyebrows and smiled. “That’s true. After all, the one you’re facing is the most terrifying Yimo in the universe void. It’s normal for it to be forced into such a sorry state.”

“Yimo?” Flame Saint Master immediately looked over. “Sorcerer God, do you know the origin of this demon?”

“I have heard of it, but this is also the first time I have seen it. It is just as the rumors say. Yimo is purely born for destruction. Its speed is extremely fast and its offensive ability is extremely strong. Moreover, its self-healing and recovery ability is also the most terrifying. Even the weakest Yimo is extremely powerful. There is only one way to kill a Yimo, and that is to forcefully use a tyrannical attack to completely crush this Yimo, not giving it a chance to heal itself!” Sorcerer God’s voice was deep.

“I don’t know how Heavenly Sword Marquis managed to get a Yimo to fight for him. However, the Yimo he got hasn’t reached that level yet. In addition, this is the Divine beginning Realm, so even a Yimo would be suppressed by the power of the will of heaven. Its strength might not be able to reach its limit, so it’s not impossible to kill it.”

As the Sorcerer God spoke, Jian Wushuang, who was not far away, narrowed his eyes.

The Yimo should have never interacted with the Divine Beginning Realm. Almost no one in the Divine Beginning Realm knew about the origin of the Yimo, such as the three masters of the Saint Realm. However, the Sorcerer God knew about the origin of the Yimo, moreover, he knew about the innate advantages of the Yimo, as well as its weaknesses, which surprised Jian Wushuang.

“Sorcerer God, since you know so much about this monster, it’s easy to deal with it. Let’s work together and kill this Yimo first, then we’ll kill Heavenly Sword Marquis,” said Flame Saint Master.

“Okay, but it’s still what I said before. If there’s a chance, it’s best to keep the corpse of Heavenly Sword Marquis. If not, I’ll force a few drops of essence blood out of his body,” said Sorcerer God.

“As long as Heavenly Sword Marquis is dead, whether we can keep his corpse or refine essence blood will depend on your own ability,” Flame Saint Master said.

“Haha, then let’s do it.” The Sorcerer God laughed and moved directly.

He did not immediately attack Jian Wushuang, but directly went to find the Yimo.

“Roar!”

The Yimo let out a terrifying roar. It had received Jian Wushuang’s order to tear the Flame Saint Master and the Sorcerer God into pieces. Therefore, when the Sorcerer God approached it, it turned around and clawed at it.

This claw easily tore apart heaven and earth.

“Haha, I’d like to see how powerful the legendary Yimo is.” The Sorcerer God laughed loudly. Facing the sharp claws of the Yimo, he had no intention of dodging. He let the Yimo’s sharp claws pass by him.

Swish!

The sharp claws did not touch any substance. The Sorcerer God’s body began to transform. In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen figures of the Sorcerer God appeared around the Yimo. Each figure seemed to be real, even Jian Wushuang could not tell which of these figures was the Sorcerer God’s original body.

As for the Yimo, it was completely enraged by the Sorcerer God. It roared crazily and attacked the figures of the Sorcerer God, but none of the attacks actually hit the Sorcerer God’s original body.

“Keke, it’s just as the rumors say. Although the Yimo is powerful, its intelligence is very low.” The Sorcerer God shook his head and laughed. Suddenly, among the dozens of figures formed by the Sorcerer God...one of the figures behind the Yimo suddenly stretched out his hand. A sharp spear that carried a gloomy and cold aura pierced into the Yimo’s body and directly pierced out from the other end of the Yimo’s body.

After being pierced by the spear, the intense pain made the Yimo more angry and irritable, and it became crazier and crazier. However, the onlookers noticed that although the Yimo became crazier...its speed actually began to slow down.

Yes, it became slower.

Logically speaking, the crazier the Yimo was, the stronger and faster it would be. However, it was obviously not like that now.

“No, that spear just now was not that simple.” Jian Wushuang frowned. He had already guessed the reason. “Is it poison?”

“Haha, my ability to fight head-on is not very strong. However, no one in the Divine Beginning Realm can match me in using poison. The blood voodoo poison that I personally refined is the pride of my life. If it was an adult Yimo with peak strength, it might be able to ignore my blood voodoo poison. However, this Yimo clearly has not reached such a level.” The Sorcerer God sneered.

The Sorcerer God Sect was famous for all kinds of strange and cold methods. When it came to using poison, the Sorcerer God Sect was also famous in the Divine Beginning Realm.

The Sorcerer God was the patriarch of the Sorcerer God Sect. When it came to using poison, perhaps no one in the Divine Beginning Realm could compare to him.

His spear just now seemed to have simply pierced through the body of the Yimo.. The Yimo had already used its self-healing ability to repair itself, but the blood voodoo poison had already been left in the Yimo’s body.
