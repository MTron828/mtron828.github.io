4141 Those Who Seek Death

“Am I seeing things? There’s actually a fourth-level Ruler among your people?” The hooked-nosed man raised an eyebrow, then began to laugh, “Haha! Is there no one left in the Life Palace? They actually sent a fourth-level Ruler to join in the fun? Are they here to be cannon fodder?”

His loud laughter attracted the attention of many experts.

“Fourth-level Ruler?”

“Mm, that’s true.”

“The Tarot Ruins are filled with Ultimate Rulers. There are even many peak existences amongst them. Why would a fourth-level Ruler like him come here?”

“A fourth-level Ruler wants to enter the Tarot Ruins? Is he courting death?”

Many experts began to laugh at him.

It was normal that the Tarot vestige attracted too many experts.

Even an ordinary Ultimate Ruler would not be looked at in the Tarot vestige.

As for a fourth-level Ruler, no one would be interested in him.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes when he sensed the strange gazes around him, but he did not say anything.

“Ninth Kalpa King, I sympathize with you. You were not well-liked in the Life Palace because you had not been able to break through to become a Supreme-being. Now that you have the chance to come to the Tarot Ruins, you have to bring a burden with you. Hahaha!” The hooked-nosed man laughed willfully.

“Silver Roc, if you are itching for a fight now, I don’t mind fighting with you here.” Ninth Kalpa King looked at the hooked-nosed man coldly.

“Let’s wait for the battle inside the relic.” The hooked-nosed man laughed dryly. Without further ado, he turned and left.

The Rulers from the various factions around them also looked away.

“Ninth Kalpa King, it looks like we have already been targeted before we even entered the Tarot Relic,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves in a deep voice.

“Hmph, he’s just a defeated opponent. Three hundred years ago, he narrowly escaped death in front of me. This time, if he dares to come knocking on our door again, I’ll just kill him,” said Ninth Kalpa King.

“I hope so,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves with a cold smile.

He knew about the hawk-nosed man, Ruler Silver Roc.

In terms of fame, Ruler Silver Roc was indeed not as famous as Ninth Kalpa King in the universe. However, he was definitely not weak. In particular, his comprehension of the universe principles was said to have reached an extremely high level, with the addition of some special secret techniques, Ruler Silver Roc was definitely ranked in the top 20 among the countless Ultimate Rulers in the vast universe. He was an extremely difficult Ultimate Ruler to deal with.

If it was a one-on-one battle, neither Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves nor Ruler Violet Eye would necessarily be a match for Ruler Silver Roc.

They had yet to enter the Tarot Ruins, but they had already been targeted by such a powerful Ruler. This was naturally not a good thing for their team.

“Alright, cut the crap. Prepare to enter the Tarot Ruins,” Ninth Kalpa King said. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The group of seven had already arrived at the entrance of the Tarot Ruins.

In the void, a vertical bronze door pressed across the starry sky. The huge door had the words ‘Tarot’ engraved on it. Other than that, there were also countless mysterious inscriptions on the side of the huge door, emitting an ancient aura.

This was the entrance of the Tarot Ruins.

One only needed to step through the huge bronze door to enter the Tarot Ruins.

“The six of you stay in the vestige and follow me. Otherwise, if you get into trouble, I won’t have the time to save you. Do you understand?

“Especially you, Jian Wushuang.” Just as they were about to enter the vestige, Ninth Kalpa King, who was walking at the front, put his hands behind his back and said with a cold face, “I’ll go in.”

Jian Wushuang nodded expressionlessly in response to Ninth Kalpa King’s warning. However, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others did not seem to take it seriously.

“Zi Tong, we are both outstanding experts among the Ultimate Rulers. Is there a need to let Ninth Kalpa King protect us? What has his attitude toward us been all this while?”

“Humph, let’s not talk about whether we will encounter any trouble in the Tarot Ruins. Even if we do, just the two of us working together should be enough to settle it. Why does he need to be Ninth Kalpa King?” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves sent a message to Ruler Violet Eye, it was obvious that there was something amiss.

“Thousand leaf, cut it out. Don’t you know about the Ninth Kalpa King?” He had always been arrogant and did not take us seriously in the Life Palace. It was normal for him to speak a little harshly now. After all, he is stronger than us. Just let him be,” said the Ruler Violet Eye with a smile, however, there was a strange feeling in his tone for some reason.

“Haha, you were defeated by a third-level Ruler in the trial ground. How can you not be strong?”

The two looked at each other and smiled in tacit understanding. They did not say anything else.

A moment later, under the lead of the Ninth Kalpa King, a group of seven people stepped through the bronze door of the Tarot Ruins.

The seven people first passed through a pitch-black void before their eyes lit up. Then, they saw that they had landed in a vast plain.

“This is the Tarot Ruins?”

“It is indeed huge. I have clearly released all my soul power and the range of coverage is quite vast. However, there isn’t a single person within the range of my soul coverage,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

There should be Rulers everywhere in the Tarot Ruins. Furthermore, the branches should be quite dense.

An Ultimate Ruler’s soul coverage area was naturally very vast. However, no one was found in the soul coverage area of emperor thousand leaves. This meant that the Tarot vestige was indeed very vast.

“Tsk, tsk, the spiritual Qi here is also quite dense. If you cultivate here, one day of cultivation is equivalent to three days of cultivation in the outside world,” the Ruler Violet Eye said with a smile.

The other members of the team were also observing their surroundings.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, raised his eyebrows as soon as he stepped into the Tarot vestige.

“This place...is rich in the universe origin of Sword Principle.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. He could sense that the buildings, mountains, and rivers in the Tarot vestige must have been created by Supreme Tarot with a single sword strike. Every mountain in the Tarot vestige was extremely smooth, it was as if it had been cut by someone with one sword strike.

He could not help but exclaim in amazement. Supreme Emperor Tarot was so powerful that he could create his own world with one sword strike.

“Jian Wushuang, among the seven of us, the Tarot vestige should have the greatest opportunity for you,” Divine Marquis Qingfeng, who was walking beside Jian Wushuang, suddenly said with a smile.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, looked at Divine Marquis Qingfeng and asked, “Divine Marquis, what do you mean?”

“Jian Wushuang, you may not know this, but Supreme Emperor Tarot used to be a Supreme-being at the top level, but there is still a slight gap between him and invincible Supreme-being,” Divine Marquis Qingfeng explained with a smile.
