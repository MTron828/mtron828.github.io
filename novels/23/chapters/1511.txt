Chapter 1512: New Universe God Ranking List

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the lofty hall, various Almighties were casually chatting.

“Real God Wu Bei already died but he is unwilling to remain out of the limelight. I really have no idea what he is trying to do.”

“Humph, it’s a pity that the restriction is too profound, even we have no way to resolve it. Otherwise, how could he make the decisions?”

“I wonder who helped him in setting up the restriction. In any case, I also have attainments in formation and I am also an Almighty. But I can’t do anything about the restriction. In Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, I reckon that only an existence of that level could possibly resolve the restriction.”

“That level? There are only a few experts of that level in the entire Cultivation Sanctuaries. They are high above and why would they bother with us?”

During a casual chat, the time flew past.

Ten days later, among the Almighties on the higher part of the hall, Tower Master Qi Fu from Vientiane Tower suddenly spoke.

“Everyone, according to various Universe Gods’ performance in the cave for the past three months, we at Vientiane Tower have established a brand new Universe God ranking list. Take a look at it.”

Tower Master Qi Fu waved and a huge list immediately floated in the middle of the hall.

A complete Universe God ranking list recorded a hundred Universe Gods who were powerful. However, compared to the ranking list before, there was obviously a drastic change.

On top of the list, there were ten eye-catching names. They were the top ten monsters on Universe God ranking list, listed from top to bottom in order.

“The first place on Universe God ranking list, God Destroying King.”

“The second place on Universe God ranking list, Zi Dongwang.”

“The third place on Universe God ranking list, White-robed Swordsman.”

“The fourth place on Universe God ranking list, Demon Girl Ling Luo.”

“The fifth place on Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang.”

“The sixth place on Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu.”

“The seventh place on Universe God ranking list, Universe God Liu Ying.”

“The eighth place on Universe God ranking list, Demon King Ice Feather.”

“The ninth place on Universe God ranking list, Seven Universe King.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“The tenth place on Universe God ranking list, Universe God Mo Shou.”

That was the brand new ranking list for the top ten monsters.

Looking at the ranking list, the experts in the hall started discussing among themselves.

Some were casually chatting, some were complimenting in silence, but most of them agreed with the rankings.

“The person on the third place on Universe God ranking list, because he didn’t announce his name when he defeated Ling Luo, Vientiane Tower has yet to find out his true name. Hence, we replaced it with White-robed Swordsman. If everyone agrees with this, we shall share the ranking list,” Tower Master Qi Fu smiled faintly.

In that instant, the ranking list spread across at terrifying speed. In less than half a day, it had spread all over Wu Bei’s cave.

The Universe Gods in Wu Bei’s cave knew of the existence of the brand new ranking list.

“The brand new Universe God ranking list put me on the fifth place?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

His true power was actually not that much stronger compared to the previous ninth place Universe God Xiong Fu. However, his martial art motion was terrifying!

The introduction of him to the brand new Universe God ranking list said that his martial art motion was number one among all Universe Gods. He was listed in the fifth place because of his martial art motion.

“The brand new Universe God ranking list is so shocking. There are so many experts that popped up from nowhere. Besides myself, among the top ten from the previous Universe God ranking list, there are three people who are not famous at all,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

In the top ten on Universe God ranking list, White-robed Swordsman, Demon King Ice Feather, and Seven Universe King were all unknown before this. They revealed terrifying powers at the fights during the three months in Wu Bei’s cave.

Among them all, the mysterious White-robed Swordsman was the strongest. He had defeated Ling Luo face to face and he was listed in third place.

Demon King Ice Feather and Seven Universe King defeated Universe God Mo Shou and then got listed in the eighth and the ninth place.

Besides the top ten, the following ranking went through a drastic change too. For instance, Long Ya who was in the fifty-first place previously, was then dropped to below seventy and Xuan Yi to lower than ninetieth too. Out of the three of them from Lineage of Star who were on Universe God ranking list, only he had proceeded to the front of the ranking list.

“It is only the first level of the cave. If there were to really be a second level to the cave like Real God Wu Bei said, there would be a total of fifty White Blaze Fruit. It definitely would stir up more carnage. By then, the ranking list would experience another drastic change again,” Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t worry much about the ranking list. Very quickly, he closed his eyes again.

However, in Wu Bei’s cave, many Universe Gods were shocked by the brand new ranking list.

In a spacious, barren land, a cold-looking purple-haired man sat. His facial expression was maliciously charming with a tinge of coldness.

He, was Zi Dongwang from the second place on Universe God ranking list. At that very moment, he was paying close attention to the brand new Universe God ranking list.

“Still the same as before, God Destroying King is high above. No one could compare with him, even I couldn’t.”

“This God Destroying King is simply a monster.”

Zi Dongwang shook his head. He had no intention to compete with God Destroying King.

“Ling Luo, she lost to a mysterious swordsman who is unknown. That is quite surprising,” Zi Dongwang frowned, “According to the ranking list, the mysterious swordsman comprehended Darkness Doctrine and Massacre Doctrine at the same time. Plus, the comprehension level is extremely high and his swordsmanship is terrifying. Ling Luo already gave her all and even performed her strongest technique but still lost!”

“The mysterious White-robed Swordsman is really powerful and he didn’t seem to be interested with White Blaze Fruit. He came to the cave purely to challenge experts. Now, he has already defeated Ling Luo. So, I should be next!”

“Humph, come on, come on. Among all Universe Gods in Eternal Chaotic World, besides God Destroying King, there is definitely no one else who could be my, Zi Dongwang’s, match.”

Zi Dongwang was confident.

…

On the top of a towering tree, a shadow in a black robe sat quietly. The figure of the shadow in a black robe was scrawny and his cold look was evil. He was giving out a unique aura. Most importantly, his eyes were a pair of extremely dark and creepy eyes that seemed to contain boundless magic power.

“Jian Wushuang, fifth place on Universe God ranking list?”

“Hehe, he didn’t even fight with me in person. Just because he killed that idiotic Xiong Fu, he is listed in the fifth place directly. The people from Vientiane Tower made arbitrary decisions!”

The evil-looking man in black robe had a chilly gleam in his eyes.

He was the sixth place on the current Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu!

One should know that Xin Zhu was previously in the fourth place on Universe God ranking list.

But because of the White-robed Swordsman and Jian Wushuang, he had dropped to the sixth place.

The White-robed Swordsman had defeated Ling Luo face to face and it was unnecessary to be in doubt of his power. Hence, Xin Zhu naturally wouldn’t suspect nor complain.

However, Jian Wushuang… he had only killed Universe God Xiong Fu and he was listed on the fifth place directly, even higher ranked than he was. Xin Zhu was naturally upset about it.
