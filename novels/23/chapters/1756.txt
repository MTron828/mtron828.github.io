Chapter 1757: Demanding The Payment Of A Debt

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

It was not easy for even Great Emperors to find Emperor Bai, let alone Jian Wushuang.

Moreover, even if he were to find Emperor Bai due to his nature-defying luck, would Emperor Bai give him the method for the Seventh Step of an Inverse Cultivator for free?

After all, as soon as Jian Wushuang obtained the method for the Seventh Step of an Inverse Cultivator, there was a high chance of him becoming an Almighty-level Inverse Cultivator in the future. Moreover, there was also hope for him to achieve a level similar to that of Emperor Bai. If Emperor Bai had some selfish motives, he would definitely not give the method to Jian Wushuang and allow Jian Wushuang to pose a threat to his position.

“Looks like I can only rely on opportunities in the future to obtain the training method of the Seventh Step of the Inverse Cultivator,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

However, due to Real God Wu Bei’s warning from before, Jian Wushuang had long prepared himself for such results.

“Oh right. Hall Master Yuan, there’s another matter which concerns the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom,” Jian Wushuang said abruptly.

“The Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom? How is the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom related to you?” Hall Master Yuan said with surprise.

“It’s like this. When Real God Wu Bei gave the training method of the Sixth Step of an Inverse Cultivator to me back then, I promised him that I would kill the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom on his behalf if I were to possess the abilities to do so.” Jian Wushuang said, “Since I have made a promise, unless I have no abilities or no way to do so, I will not go back on my words.”

Jian Wushuang would not make promises easily. However, he held promises in high regard.

Back then in Wu Bei’s cave, since he had promised Real God Wu Bei, he would always hold it firmly in his mind.

Previously, he had not had enough abilities. However, things had changed…

“I see.” Hall Master Yuan understood and said, “The Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom is a ruler of many Holy Kingdoms and his reputation is not small within the Eternal Chaotic World. Moreover, he is a member of the Sanctuary Alliance. As for his abilities, he is a top Sir God expert. With your current abilities, if it were one to one, it would be possible for you to kill him. However, the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom’s background is not simple.”

“Background?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Regarding the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom’s abilities, he already knew about it previously. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, he did not know about the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom’s background. Hence, he was asking Hall Master Yuan to get to know some background of the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom.

“Jian Wushuang, just now, I told you that within the Sanctuary Alliance, apart from the Masters of the Ten Sanctuaries, there are three other Great Emperors. Putting Emperor Bai aside, among the two remaining Great Emperors, there is a Great Emperor Zi Xu. Among the thirteen Great Emperors, Great Emperor Zi Yu can be considered one of the top five. Moreover, the relationship between the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom and Great Emperor Zi Xu is not normal. It is said that when Great Emperor Zi Xu was still a Real God, he owed the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom a favor. After that, he became a Great Emperor and the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom has been serving under him ever since.”

“If you wish to kill the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom, you have to get past the level of Great Emperor Zi Xu,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Previously, he had known that the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom had a great background. However, he did not expect his background to actually be so deep-rooted.

With such friendship with a Great Emperor and that Great Emperor Zi Xu owed him a favor, if he were to come across any danger, Great Emperor Zi Xu would definitely come to rescue him personally.

Moreover, if he were to avenge Real God Wu Bei by killing the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom, there would be a high chance of Great Emperor Zi Xu coming personally to kill him.

“Seems like I will be unable to take revenge for Real God Wu Bei for another short period of time,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had promised to help Real God Wu Bei take revenge. Moreover, he would only do so when he had the abilities and he had to also be in a situation where he was sure that he could stay alive.

However, at that moment, it was obvious that his abilities were not enough.

“At the very least, I must wait until I have enough things to capitalize on that I can face Great Emperor Zi Xu. Then, I will be able to take action against the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom for real,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Jian Wushuang, it is impossible for you to kill the Monarch of the Demon Heart Kingdom now and I believe that you would not be so stupid.” Hall Master glanced at Jian Wushuang and continued speaking, “Since your abilities have fully recovered, what do you plan to do next?”

“Next…” Jian Wushuang could not help but raise the corners of his mouth, “I want to demand the payment of a debt!”

“Demand the payment of a debt?” Hall Master Yuan was stunned, “The Soaring Heaven King Palace?”

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head earnestly, “To begin with, there is a huge grudge between me and the Soaring Heaven King Palace that is unresolved. Moreover, outside the Buddhist Demon Sea back then, they almost killed me when I was seriously injured and I remember this debt extremely clearly. Hence, I must absolutely think of a way to get them to repay me.”

“It’s easy to say that. However, the abilities of the Soaring Heaven King Palace are not normal, do you have the confidence to deal with them?” Hall Master Yuan said with concern.

“Don’t worry. Since I dare to demand the payment of a debt, I naturally have absolute confidence,” Jian Wushuang laughed, “Hall Master Yuan, you definitely have a better understanding of the Soaring Heaven King Palace than me. Please tell me what kind of experts the Soaring Heaven King Palace have, as well as some of the trump cards that they possess. With this, I will be more prepared.”

Jian Wushuang knew about some experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, he did not know all of them.

“No problem.” Hall Master Yuan said immediately. “According to the information that the Lineage of Star has collected, there are a total of eleven Almighties in the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Among the Almighties, nine of them are Sir Gods while the remaining two are Emperor Gods.”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes could not help but shrink.

The Soaring Heaven King Palace was a top powerhouse of the Eternal Chaotic World as well and it was no wonder that their ways of doing things had always been so unreasonable.

It seemed that they were unreasonable due to their absolute abilities.

An Almighty was strong enough to be called someone with great authority in the Eternal Chaotic World. However, the Soaring Heaven King Palace actually had a total of eleven of them!

It should be known that a similar top powerhouse like the Lineage of Star only contained three Almighties. By including Jian Wushuang, who possessed the fighting capabilities of an Almighty, there were only four of them. Compared to the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they were indeed lacking a lot in terms of numbers.

If not for the Star Palace Master, with the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s abilities, they would probably be able to suppress the Lineage of Star completely.

“For the nine Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, there are some with strong abilities, as well as some with weak abilities. In particular, there are three of them who stand at the top of the Sir Gods. As for the two Emperor Gods, they are Emperor God Tian Ling and Emperor God Tian Xiao. These two Emperor Gods are the oldest existences in the Soaring Heaven King Palace. At the same time, they are also the two founders of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Among the two of them, Emperor God Tian Ling is the stronger one!”

“Emperor God Tian Ling has been famous for a long time and he became famous a lot sooner than our Palace Master. Moreover, his abilities long ago achieved the peak of an Emperor God and he is slightly stronger than the Palace Master. In the Eternal Chaotic World, he is also a well-known super expert,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

The current him could compete with Emperor God experts head-on, and if he were to encounter Emperor Gods at a similar level to Emperor God Xue Gu, he would not be fearful at all. However, if he were to encounter a top Emperor God, he would not have absolute confidence.

Fortunately, Hall Master Yuan said again: “Emperor God Tian Ling is proud and ambitious. Ever since he achieved the peak of being an Emperor God, he has been trying every means to go for Great Emperor. Moreover, it would definitely be impossible to make a breakthrough to Great Emperor if he were to rely on his own training. Therefore, there is a need for him to look for opportunities. As such, for many years, Emperor God Tian Ling has been travelling in the Second lair and he will only return once every hundreds of thousands of years.”
