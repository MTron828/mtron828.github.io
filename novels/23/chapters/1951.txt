Chapter 1952 Killing

The cultivators from Green Fire World previously thought that Wushuang City Master was only a Real God and he couldn’t match Emperor God Xie Xin evenly.

However, then… Jian Wushuang had yet to attack and he only stood there but Emperor God Xie Xin had already started running for his life without hesitation.

“That, that is Wushuang City Master, the legend of our Green Fire World!!”

Many experts from Green Fire World clenched their fists as their eyes shimmered with adoration.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang’s face changed the moment he saw Emperor God Xie Xin started running away.

At first, he had wanted to ask a few questions before he killed Emperor God Xie Xin. He had never expected Emperor God Xie Xin to be so determined to run away.

“Humph!”

“Can you escape?”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice reverberated in the universe.

The moment his voice resounded, a vast purple light soared up and instantly covered a range of few million miles.

One Realm Pearl turned into a formation at one’s will!

“Sh*t!”

Emperor God Xie Xin looked at the formation around him and his face grew grave. Not only that, he also realized that the moment the formation took shape, the surrounding spacetime would be sealed off.

He couldn’t even send a message to the outside world even if he wanted to.

“Sword Emperor, I have no intention to offend you. I can swear that I will never tell anyone else about this battlefield and Green Fire World. Let me go!” Emperor God Xie Xin roared. He regretted it. He regretted coming to Green Fire World. He had never expected to meet Sword Emperor there.

“Humph. So what if you swear? Secrets will only be safe with a dead person,” Jian Wushuang was soaring with murderous intention.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Four resplendent golden lights suddenly soared up and instantly burst out.

“That is…”

Looking at the four golden lights, Emperor God Xie Xin’s eyes dilated in shock.

He also knew about Jian Wushuang. He knew that the scariest thing about Jian Wushuang was his four golden swords.

The four golden swords possessed the power of a Peak Emperor God each. With four, even Palace Master Wu Luo, who was a Peak Emperor God, would be suppressed.

“Go away!”

At such a crucial moment, Emperor God Xie Xin took out a huge axe.

The huge axe was billowing with imposing aura. It was a Chaotic Divine Treasure.

Emperor God Xie Xin wielded the axe in his hand.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were four continuous low thuds and Emperor God Xie Xin suddenly retreated. However, the four Hong Jun Golden Swords burst out in a different direction from the impact.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

From what he knew, Emperor God Xie Xin was only an ordinary Emperor God and probably at the bottom of the tier. He didn’t even have any skills that he was good at.

Theoretically, such an Emperor God should be killed by his Hong Jun Golden Swords with one attack. However, he had blocked the four Hong Jun Golden Swords and wasn’t injured.

“It seems that I belittled you.”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold and Blood Mountain Sword was suddenly drawn out from the scabbard. Under the sword intention, he took a stride forward and plunged out.

“Not good.”

Emperor God Xie Xin quaked with terror.

“The rumors said that Sword Emperor not only had the four golden swords, his close-body combat was terrifying too. If both collaborated flawlessly, he could easily kill a Peak Emperor God!”

“I definitely can’t fight him head-on!”

Emperor God Xie Xin knew his limitations.

He had wandered at the surrounding ancient battlefield for over twelve thousand years. Because of the opportunities obtained, his power had increased tremendously. He could barely be considered to be one with fighting power of a Peak Emperor God.

However, with such fighting power, he absolutely didn’t stand a chance before the infamous Sword Emperor.

Looking at Jian Wushuang approaching him, Emperor God Xie Xin suddenly flicked his wrist and took out a bronze mirror that gave out mysterious aura. He gripped the bronze mirror tight as he concentrated his divine power.

Vroom! Vroom!

Two boundless auras soared up from the bronze mirror.

The two auras were as cold as if they were from Acheron.

In an instant, the two auras substantiated in the void and became two black shadows.

The two shadows were like ordinary human cultivators but they were greater in size. They were more than three meters tall. There wasn’t real eyeballs in their eye sockets, only a ball of black flame, just like ghost fire.

“Hold him back!”

Emperor God Xie Xin commanded and the two black shadows suddenly charged at Jian Wushuang.

The two cold yet fierce auras locked onto Jian Wushuang.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

He could feel that the two black shadows were fierce in fighting power. They had brought about pressure that wouldn’t be weaker than an ordinary Peak Emperor God’s.

Plus, there were two shadows that joined forces which equaled to two Peak Emperor Gods. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Humph, you think you can stop me with these two shadows? Then, you can escape?” Jian Wushuang humphed coldly, “Jian Yi!”

Swoosh!

A figure suddenly appeared in the void, became engulfed in the formation and instantly turned into flowing light. He moved to Emperor God Xie Xin at a terrifyingly fast speed.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t care about Emperor God Xie Xin in the beginning, there were too many associated matters after all. In order to prevent the uncertainties, he let Jian Yi rush over.

Just as he was held back by the two shadows, Jian Yi took action.

“D*mn it!”

Emperor God Xie Xin grew distressed but he wasn’t hopeless.

Then, he had already reached the border of the formation that was transformed with One Realm Pearl. Jian Yi was slightly further away from him.

He totally stood a chance to flee.

He flicked his wrist again and took out a stone rod. The stone rod was only half a rod left.

The stone rod was a unique treasure that he had found during the twelve thousand years he had wandered around the surrounding battlefield. It was extremely useful.

It was originally complete. However, he had come across danger previously and he had broken half of it.

“In a life-and-death situation, I can’t think so much,” Emperor God Xie Xin’s gaze was cold.

As he gripped his palm tight.

“Bang!”

The remaining stone rod exploded. After it exploded, there was a billowing power that flooded.

The strength of the power had yet to reach the level of a Great Emperor but it was already extremely close to one.

Plus, the power concentrated in one spot as it exploded.

Hong!

There was a loud bang on the purple formation that was made by One Realm Pearl. Then, in the place where the power swept out, there was a huge opening.

“I managed to escape!”

Emperor God Xie Xin was filled with excitement. However, just as he smiled, he stiffened.

Because he had realized that Jian Yi was right behind him.

And, there was a scary palm which seized his throat.

“How could he be so fast?”

Emperor God Xie Xin stared and his face was in terror.

“This, this is… Great Emperor?”

With astonishment, Emperor God Xie Xin’s head had already shattered into pieces.
