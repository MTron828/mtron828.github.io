Chapter 1292: The Little Scattered Stars Game

On the vacant lot, Jian Wushuang and the others were confused. They didn’t understand what the Master of Dayu Palace had gathered the disciples of quick comprehension together for.

“I received an interesting arrangement of chess pieces on a chessboard in a secret land not long ago. There are in total of a hundred steps in the chess game and every step equals a test!”

“In other words, a hundred steps equal a hundred tests. Today, I’m going to use that particular arrangement of chess pieces on the chessboard to test the comprehension level of the inner disciples in Dayu Palace.”

The Master of Dayu Palace finished and waved his hand. A huge game of chess appeared from nowhere in the vacant lot before them.

The most interesting part was that there were only black chess pieces, no white ones. There were a hundred black pieces in total.

Everyone on the vacant lot lifted their heads and looked at the chess simultaneously.

“This chess game?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows slightly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He remembered when he first came to Dayu Palace, the White Sector God once told him that Lord Wu Cang had been studying a chess game strategy intensively with the Master of Dayu Palace. Would it be the chess arrangement before him?

King of Venomous Worms in Jian Wushuang’s body laughed when he saw the chess arrangement, “I see. It’s this chess arrangement. No wonder it’s said that it i meant for testing one’s comprehension level.”

“King of Venomous Worms, you know the origins of this chess arrangement?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course,” King of Venomous Worms laughed, “This chess arrangement has an impressive history. In the entire Eternal Chaotic World, even in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, it is very famous!”

“Very famous in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The ten Cultivation Sanctuaries were the core of the Eternal Chaotic World, a place full of experts! It was different to a Kingdom – different to the world that he was in.

“This chess arrangement is called the Little Scattered Stars Game. The person that created it is a supreme man.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Supreme?” Jian Wushuang stared.

He found out from King of Venomous Worms long ago that only a superb existence like the creator of Lineage of Star and King Luo Zhen would be impressive enough to be referred to as supreme.

The chess arrangement before him was by a superb expert of that level?

“That supreme man created two sets of chess arrangement. One is the Little Scattered Stars Game that you’re looking at right now and there is another one called the Great Scattered Stars Game!”

“The Little Scattered Stars Game only has a hundred moves. It isn’t too valuable. The Great Scattered Stars Game has a total of ten thousand moves. That is the really terrifying and unpredictable game!” King of Venomous Worms exclaimed, “Of course, for your level of cultivation as of now, the Little Scattered Stars Game is impressive enough. Jian Wushuang, the Master of Dayu Palace took this out and he should give you a chance to solve it. You must seize the opportunity to study how to solve this game!”

“The game is said to be testing one’s comprehension level. But in actual fact, it contains a significant element of luck. The more moves you resolve, the higher the possibility that you get a lucky chance.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils dilated and he began to look forward to it.

“After the Master of Dayu Palace took out the Little Scattered Stars Game, he looked around. He first looked towards Universe God Qing Yang, “Qing Yang, previously when Holy Prefecture wanted to send you to attend my class, I refused. The reason why I have made an exception is due to this chess game. I would like to see if you, known as the number one genius in Dayu World, can solve many moves in ten years time.”

“Ten years?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He could tell that it would take ten years to resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game.

“I will try my best.” Universe God Qing Yang replied.

The Master of Dayu Palace smiled and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang.”

“Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“You’re extremely gifted. Maybe you wouldn’t be any weaker compared to Qing Yang. It’s a pity that you are merely a Universe Master. To solve the chess game as a Universe Master, you shouldn’t be able to solve too many moves. However, I will give you an opportunity to solve this chess game. You will have the same time as the rest – ten years. Seize the opportunity!” The Master of Dayu Palace said.

“Thank you, Palace Master!” Jian Wushuang replied, nodding calmly but being inwardly delighted.

“Alright, I already told White Sector God to prepare a secret room for each of you. Every secret room has the exact same chess game for you to solve. All of you have ten years time. As for what kind of lucky chance you could get during the ten years time of solving the chess game, it solely depends on your choices. Go ahead!” The Master of Dayu Palace waved.

On the vacant lot, many of the inner disciples of Dayu Palace started moving, including Jian Wushuang.

However, there were two people that didn’t move on the lot.

The two people were Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao!

“Universe God Qing Yang, frankly speaking, I am unhappy about you being recognized as the number one genius in Dayu World. As we have to see who wins and who loses, we shall begin our match with this chess game,” Chu Xiao said as he looked at Universe Qing Yang.

“What do you want to do?” Universe God Qing Yang smiled faintly.

“Very simple. We don’t have to go into the secret room. Both of us resolve this chess game in front of the Palace Master, in front of all experts in Dayu Palace. We shall see who resolve more moves in ten years time. How about that?” Chu Xiao said.

“Right here on the vacant lot?” Universe God Qing Yang was surprised.

The surrounding inner disciples in Dayu Palace were extremely shocked as well.

It was known that the chess game was unfathomable. They definitely had to be calm if they wanted to solve it. It’d be best if they weren’t influenced by the outside world, so to resolve the chess game in the stand-alone secret room would be the best choice.

But if they were to solve the chess game on the vacant lot directly, they could see the move that the other person play. During the process of solving the chess game, their speed might be affected.

“Why? Are you scared?” Chu Xiao said in an forceful way.

“Hehe, you have the guts to. Why don’t I?” Universe God Qing Yang smiled in reply, “Okay, let’s resolve the chess game on this vacant lot then!”

Chu Xiao saw that Universe God Qing Yang agreed and he immediately revealed a smile.

The surrounding inner disciples watched..

“Those two…” Jian Wushuang shook his head when he saw Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao.

“Hehe, all geniuses. It’s a pity that they had such a good life that they’ve become arrogant” King of Venomous Worms smiled.

“Exactly,” Jian Wushuang commented. “They seem dazzling but in actual fact, they have had too smooth of a life.”

Jian Wushuang was different from the two of them. Although he had not been cultivating for long, he had been rising abruptly under adverse circumstances.

Not long after he was born, he had begun experiencing countless life and death situations. He had never had a great life.

“Jian Wushuang, they are competing against each other. You are also as famous as Universe God Qing Yang in Dayu World, you don’t want to join them for the competition?” King of Venomous Worms joked.

“I’m not interested,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and walked towards the secret room under the lead of White Sector God.
