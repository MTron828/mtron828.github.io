Chapter 1293: Resolved

In the stand-alone secret room, Jian Wushuang sat before the Little Scattered Stars Game.

On the chessboard sat a hundred black chess pieces.

Jian Wushuang looked at the first black chess piece and covered it with his Soul Power. Suddenly, the surrounding scene underwent tremendous change.

It became a barren land covered in snow, and there was a figure in a white robe at the forefront.

The instant Jian Wushuang saw the figure in the white robe, that figure suddenly drew a sword and dashed forward at his throat with an extremely sharp blade.

That sword was as swift as lightning and it was extremely cold!

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows and wanted to resist the hit with his unique skill, but he realized that he couldn’t feel any Tao in this boundless snow world.

The unique skill that he created was based on his three strongest Sword Principles. His unique skills couldn’t be put to use at all when he didn’t have Tao.

Unable to feel the existence of Tao, and unable to give full force to his unique skill, Jian Wushuang could only rely on his understanding about swordsmanship to defend himself.

Clang!

Both hits collided and before Jian Wushuang could counterattack, he had already retreated from the boundless snow world.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

“King of Venomous Worms, what is going on?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“What’s going on? It’s because of the move you didn’t resolve earlier.” King of Venomous Worms laughed in disdain, “Jian Wushuang, the Little Scattered Stars Game was created by the supreme man. It’s extremely intriguing. The chess arrangement itself was designed for a practitioner. As you are a sword principle cultivator, you naturally are required to resolved sword movement in the chess arrangement!”

“Sword movement?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and recalled the sharp yet cool sword movement that the figure in the white robe had displayed.

That swing was really an extremely threatening sword movement.

“You mean, I have to resolve that sword movement?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yeah, it isn’t like you’d be done without doing anything but resisting. You have to counter-attack or break your opponent’s sword movement. Do you understand?” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“Of course I understand that. But the sword movement that the person in white pulled contained a sword principle. He could obviously feel the existence of the sword principle. But I couldn’t feel the three strongest sword principle that I set up. How can I resolve this?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“Who says you can’t resolve the sword movement if you can’t feel the sword principle?” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned and suddenly lifted his head.

“Yeah, if there wasn’t the existence of the sword principle, the swordsmanship of the figure in white couldn’t be resolved!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were beaming with light, glimmering like a blade.

“Jian Wushuang, you have been fighting with many people on a daily basis with a combination of swordsmanship and sword principle. But most of the time, you relied on your sword principle too much. Hence, you forget the nature of swordsmanship. What the Little Scattered Stars Game is testing is the nature of swordsmanship. It’s testing whether you could defeat swordsmanship that contained sword principle without relying on sword principle yourself, and even without swordsmanship.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Swordsmanship!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Nature!”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“It’s great that you understood. Under normal circumstances, you could hardly abandon sword principle and focus on training in the nature of swordsmanship. You rarely have a chance to! Even if you could ignore sword principles on your own… but due to the three strongest sword principles that you set up, your swordsmanship naturally comes together with sword principles. The Little Scattered Stars Game gave you this opportunity!”

“This opportunity is hard to come by. You have to grasp it and try to resolve as many moves as possible!” King of Venomous Worms said, “The Master of Dayu Palace said that you are only a Universe Master and you wouldn’t be able to resolve many steps. It makes sense because the Little Scattered Stars Game is influenced by the practitioners but you are doing inverse cultivation!”

“The inverse cultivation in Universe Master level is actually at the same starting point with the Universe Gods in the First Heaven. Hence, the moves that you can resolve might not be any lower than them. Not to mention that your comprehension level is better. That’s why you definitely have a possibility of resolving more moves than the others.”

“Ten years time. Work hard!”

Hearing what King of Venomous Worms said, Jian Wushuang let out a sigh with a strange gaze in his eyes. The next moment, he looked towards the Little Scattered Stars Game before him.

Soon, Jian Wushuang was absorbed in resolving the sword movement.

When Jian Wushuang was resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao were sitting side by side on the vacant lot outside of the Fairy Palace before a set of chess. The two of them started resolving the chess game before anyone else.

The two of them were fighting against each other as they were resolving the chess game.

They quickly found ways and solutions to resolve the game.

Merely a day later, there was a black chess piece that suddenly dispersed before Chu Xiao’s chess set.

The dispersal of black chess piece meant that the first move had been resolved.

“Chu Xiao has already resolved the first move!”

“It has only been a day!”

“Universe God Qing Yang has yet to resolve the first move!”

The surrounding inner disciples from Dayu Palace, including the experts that had rushed over, were all looking at their match.

At the entrance of the Fairy Palace, the Master of Dayu Palace was seated on the throne. Wu Cang had already rushed to the scene as well and he took a seat next to the Master of Dayu Palace. Everyone fixed their gazes at the match before them.

When Chu Xiao was the first to resolve the first move, Wu Cang revealed a smile, “Solved the first move on the first day. Your disciple in Dayu Palace is not too shabby.”

“Of course,” the Master of Dayu Palace smiled faintly.

Just as Chu Xiao resolved the first move, the first black chess piece disappeared from the chess board before Universe God Qing Yang. Obviously, he had also resolved the first move.

“Your speed is too slow.” Chu Xiao stole a glance at Universe God Qing Yang.

“This is only the first move. What are you so anxious for?” Universe God Qing Yang smiled, unfazed.

After all, the Little Scattered Scar Game had a total of a hundred moves and they had a time span of ten years to solve it. So what if he fell behind on the first move?

The two of them didn’t talk much but continued to solve the game.

The time passed by slowly.

On the third day of solving the Little Scattered Stars Game, Jian Wushuang, who was in the secret room, finally opened his eyes and the corner of his lips lifted.

“I spent three days and I finally resolved the first move in the Little Scattered Stars Game,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Humph. You only solved the first day after three days. Your speed is too slow.” King of Venomous Worms snorted, “From what I know, there are many geniuses that solved the first move the first time they saw the chess set!”

“It’s my first time adapting to an environment without sword principle. It’s inevitable that my speed is slower. Until I get used to it, the efficiency will also be different. I have ten years’ time, why are you so nervous?” Jian Wushuang didn’t seem bothered, but he quickly closed his eyes again and started resolving the second sword movement.
