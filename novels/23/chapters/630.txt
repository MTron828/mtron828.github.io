Chapter 631: Jian Wushuang Makes His Move!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Upon seeing the Puppet Fighter which fought with Qianqiu Wuhen being directly destroyed, all the people on the Drill Ground quieted down.

Was the Puppet Fighter broken?

He only attacked twice, with the first palm slapping the Puppet Fighter away while the other directly smashed it!

After all, the battle strength of the Puppet Fighter was equal to Feng, who was one of the top 20 geniuses in the Firmament Territory Feast. Additionally, its body was stronger than an ordinary Skyscraping Realm warrior. However, it was still smashed by two palms. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

How powerful was he?

“How terrifying!”

“Too strong!”

“This guy... is simply a monster!”

Countless geniuses widened their eyes in awe and horror as Qianqiu Wuhen slowly walked out of the battlefield.

Many of these geniuses couldn’t hold out against the Puppet Fighter for long and some of them were even defeated by it very quickly, but Qianqiu Wuhenhad smashed it with only two palms.

There was a huge gap between their strength!

After seeing what happened on the battlefield, those experts from all sects in the Skyward Pavillion couldn’t calm down at all.

The three experts on the top floor who represented the magnates were a little excited.

“Qianqiu Wuhen is very impressive!”

“He has an extremely great understand of the Raging Fire Dao, comprehending the first level and most of the second level. Besides, the Secret Skill that he created is extremely powerful and can completely display his comprehension in the Raging Fire Dao. How amazing!”

“He fought in the first round of the genius battle, but his strength wasn’t that exaggerated. It’s clear that he didn’t use his full power at that time and what he just revealed might not be his limit either.”

The three experts representing the three magnates all spoke highly of Qianqiu Wuhen.

The experts from the other sects were also shocked by Qianqiu Wuhen’sdisplay of strength.

“Given his strength, this Qianqiu Wuhen could definitely have won first prize in the some of the previous Firmament Territory Feasts. The previous champion’s battle strength is actually slightly weaker than his. But the geniuses in this feast are all stronger than the previous ones, so it’s not yet clear whether this little guy can rank first.”

“Yes. It’s a little early to confirm he’ll be the first, but he’ll at worst rank third.”

“Go to tell Qianqiu Wuhen that we, the Immortal Dynasty, are willing to offer him admission as an inner disciple.”

“Tell Qianqiu Wuhen that if he joins us, Cloud Sea Asgard, there’ll be endless cultivation resources available to him.”

“Elder Fire, from our Boundless Demon Sect, has the strongest comprehension in the Raging Fire Dao among all the Eternal Realm cultivators in the Firmament Territory. Tell him that as long as he’s willing to join us, the Boundless Demon Sect, I’ll personally recommend him to Elder Fire.”

The three magnates and various top-class sects all invited Qianqiu Wuhen in succession.

As for the medium and small sects, they all knew clearly that top geniuses like Qianqiu Wuhen were talented people that they could never possess. They also knew that they couldn’t win against the top-class sects, so they were sensible enough to not even try inviting him.

However, there was an extremely special existence among all the sects—the Ancient Sect.

Generally speaking, the Ancient Sect could compete with the three magnates in strength, but they didn’t do anything after Qianqiu Wuhen showed his strength.

In the room where the Ancient Sect was, Xuan Yi, the purple-haired man with a gentle smiling face, looked down towards the Drill Ground.

“Qianqiu Wuhen?”

“He has good talent, but...”

“These geniuses are far more gifted than those in the previous feasts. There are at least three geniuses who can compete with him, but they aren’t in a hurry to expose their strength. After all, no one knows what they’ll encounter in the third and fourth round of the genius battle. The more strength they hide, the more trump cards they’ll have, which will also increase the possibility of them winning.”

“So, this Qianqiu Wuhen is a bit impatient.”

Xuan Yi shook his head and just watched quietly. He didn’t ask the white-robed man to send out any invitations to the geniuses on the Drill Ground.

The second round was still going on. The shattered Puppet Fighter had been replaced and it was Jian Wushuang’s turn after this batch of geniuses.

Under the watchful eyes of the other geniuses and the sect experts in the Skyward Pavilion, Jian Wushuang entered one of the battlefields.

While standing in front of the Puppet Fighter, he could clearly sense the pressure it released.

“Start!”

Outside the battlefield, with the shout from the middle-aged man, all five Puppet Fighters moved at the same time.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang clearly heard the wind-breaking sound in front of him as the Puppet Fighter’s figure appeared, holding a long spear.

The moment the Puppet Fighter stood in front of Jian Wushuang, the long spear fiercely struck at him.

A mighty power burst forth immediately.

Jian Wushuang had seen other geniuses fighting against this Puppet Fighter outside the battlefield, so he had known a little bit about its strength. Thus, he dared not be careless.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang radiated killing intent as he held the Heart-killing Sword in his hand. A bright beam shot out as he directly chopped at the Fighter Puppet.

The whole area suddenly fell into darkness.

Jian Wushuang directly displayed the Superior Rank One Secret Skill, Cataclysm Skill!

“Bang!”

There was the sound of a tremendous collision as a great pressure arrived, causing Jian Wushuang’s face to instantly darken. He staggered and immediately took a quick step backwards.

“Its power is genuinely strong, but it still weaker than Feng’s attack.”

Jian Wushuang was forced to step back, but a smile appeared on his face.

“The Puppet Fighter’s strength is good, but... It will only keep this up for 15 minutes. I don’t even need to display the World Dao.”

Hua!

The Puppet Fighter flickered about like a ghost, forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat as it quickly rushed to attack him. The long spear in its hand lunged out like a poisonous snake. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Spear shadows darted forward like a poisonous snake’s tongue, so quickly that no one could see them before they came into contact with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s vision darted about like lightning while the Sword Soul in his sea of consciousness was emitting Sword Soul Power. Jian Wushuang wielded the Heart-killing Sword, producing sword shadows and releasing an incredible amount of power as he fought against the Puppet Fighter.

Their battle was extremely intense.

Jian Wushuang was completely suppressed, but there was no sign that he would be defeated.

“Huh?”

In the Skyward Pavilion, the experts from the different sects all looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“This little guy has great talent in Sword Principle.”

“Yes, his Sword Soul Power is extremely strong. It’s much stronger than many Sword Principle geniuses.”
