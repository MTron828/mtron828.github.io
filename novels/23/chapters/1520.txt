Chapter 1521: Satisfied

Indeed.

If he hadn’t come across Duan Lingfeng this time round, Jian Wushuang would be in big trouble.

Perhaps he could think of a way to survive in the hands of Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying. However, he would definitely need to give up his White Blaze Fruits.

“Duan Lingfeng, you are completely uninterested in the White Blaze Fruit?” Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Lingfeng.

“That’s right,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head indifferently.

“If that’s the case, I shall not give you White Blaze Fruits. I have armor here with me and I obtained it from Universe God Xiong Fu previously. Please take it,” Jian Wushuang took out some black armor. The black armor was a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure and it was Universe God Xiong Fu’s treasure to protect his body with.

After seeing the black armor, Duan Lingfeng frowned, “Jian Wushuang, you should know that I helped you not for the White Blaze Fruit, and not for this armor.”

“I know,” Jian Wushuang laughed, “However, I still need your help from here on. The stronger you are, the greater your help will be to me. This armor should be able to raise your fighting capabilities slightly.”

Jian Wushuang could tell long ago that the divine weapons and defensive armors that Duan Lingfeng used were first-rate Universe God-level Chaos Unique Treasures. In spite of that, he was still able to push back Zi Dongwang.

If he had Real God-level armor, his abilities would definitely rise considerably. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You want me to team up with you?” Duan Lingfeng looked over.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang did not hide the truth, “I have nine White Blaze Fruits with me now. Hence, I am definitely a popular target. Since so many Universe Gods in this cave want to kill me and I’m alone, if I were to come across a situation like just now, I would be unable to deal with it. However, if I were to team up with you, it would be different.”

Duan Lingfeng had been ranked third previously. After his match with Zi Dongwang, it proved that he had abilities to rank second on the Universe God ranking list.

In the entire cave, probably only the God Destroying King was superior to him. Hence, if Jian Wushuang were to team up with him, he could move around the cave freely.

“In addition, during my match with Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying just now, I benefited considerably. Next, I have no plans to continue moving around to fight for the White Blaze Fruits. Instead, I want to find a place to train for a period of time. During the process of my training, I will naturally need an expert like you to protect me,” Jian Wushuang emphasized the word ‘expert’ intentionally.

“I see,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head and took the black armor immediately, “I shall accept this armor.”

After seeing that, Jian Wushuang revealed a smile.

…

On the second level of the cave, one of the greatest commotions was when a total of eight White Blaze Fruits appeared at the same time.

This piece of news spread through the whole cave in a moment, just like a hurricane.

Other pieces of news that were spread included the shocking match between the five experts Jian Wushuang, the White-robed Swordsman (Duan Lingfeng), Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu, and Universe God Liu Ying.

These five experts were part of the top ten of the Universe God ranking list. In particular, Zi Dongwang and the White-robed Swordsman were ranked second and third respectively.

However, the end result was…

During the match between Zi Dongwang and the White-robed Swordsman, Zi Dongwang was at a disadvantage.

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying had teamed up and they hoped to kill Jian Wushuang. However, both of them were unable to do anything to Jian Wushuang at all, even after demonstrating all of their tricks.

As soon as the news got out, countless Universe Gods were astonished.

In the vast hall outside the cave, many Almighties, including the Real Gods from various forces, also got the news before long. After that, all of them gasped in admiration.

“This Jian Wushuang’s luck is really good. Since he was targeted by Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu at the same time, even if he didn’t die, he would have to have to give up quite a number of White Blaze Fruits. That was what I thought at first. However, who could expect him to come across the White-robed Swordsman at that critical moment? Moreover, the White-robed Swordsman is actually good friends with him?”

“Although Jian Wushuang is a disciple of the Lineage of Star, he is good friends with the White-robed Swordsman. Could the White-robed Swordsman be in the Lineage of Star as well?”

“No, no. The White-robed Swordsman is definitely not in the Lineage of Star. This point has already been confirmed. Perhaps the both of them got to know one another while they were travelling in the outside world.”

“No matter what, Jian Wushuang has teamed up with the White-robed Swordsman. Hence, it will be difficult to get the White Blaze Fruits from him again.”

Many experts who were present understood.

One was ranked fifth in the Universe God ranking list, while the other one was one of the top three. Moreover, at that very moment, he had been acknowledged as the number two. Since the two experts had teamed up, not many people in the cave would dare to provoke them.

“Lei Chao, seems like your Lineage of Star is destined to benefit greatly.”

“I agree. Since Jian Wushuang and the White-robed Swordsman has teamed up, probably no one in the cave will lay their hands on his nine White Blaze Fruits.”

The Real Gods were also chatting and laughing wantonly.

“My Lineage of Star does not wish to have great benefits. However, since luck is at the doorstep, we cannot reject it,” Lei Chao laughed apathetically and he felt more relaxed. After that, he messaged Jian Wushuang and questioned, “Jian Wushuang, what is your status now?”

“I’m all right. The clash with Xin Zhu and Zi Dongwang did not result in any losses,” Jian Wushuang replied immediately.

“How about your good friend, the White-robed Swordsman?” Lei Chao continued asking.

“He’s with me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s great,” Lei Chao continued speaking: “Jian Wushuang, listen up. Now, you have already obtained nine White Blaze Fruits. To the Lineage of Star, this is already enough; don’t hope for too much. After all, you are now the target of everyone. Hence, for the time being, you don’t need to travel around to fight other White Blaze Fruits. Please find a place and stay put until this fight comes to a complete end.”

“Ideally, get your good friend to stay with you the whole way. If there is a need, give him a few White Blaze Fruits.”

“Haha, Lord Lei Chao, don’t worry. That good friend of mine has agreed to team up with me. Moreover, he is not the least bit interested in the White Blaze Fruit. Hence, I gave him the Real God-level armor that I obtained from killing Universe God Xiong Fu previously,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“That’s for the best,” Lei Chao nodded his head and terminated the transmission.

On the second level of Wu Bei’s cave, Jian Wushuang was sitting down with his legs crossed in the deepest part of a cave, which was situated halfway up a mountain, and was storing Lei Chao’s transmission token slowly.

“Even without Lord Lei Chao saying so, I have no plans to participate in the upcoming fights for the White Blaze Fruits,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

Since the moment of the opening of the second level of the cave to the current point in time, thirty-seven White Blaze Fruits had appeared. Hence, there were thirteen fruits that had not appeared yet.

Therefore, the fight was still ongoing. However, Jian Wushuang had no plans to participate.

He had already obtained a total of nine White Blaze Fruits and was satisfied with that.

For the remaining time, he would allow the Universe Gods to continue fighting for the White Blaze Fruits. He himself had planned to stay in the mountain all along. As for Duan Lingfeng, he was inside a neighboring cave, refining the Real God-level armor.
