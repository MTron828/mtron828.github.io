Chapter 2350: Hong Jun Divine Rod

“A meagre Early Stage Chaotic Realm can take a punch from me and survive!? Your talents are indeed incredible. However, the shame is you did something you shouldn’t have done and offended someone you couldn’t afford to. Now die!” Killing intent raged in Xiang Yi’s eyes. The moment he finished his words, a dull gold rod surfaced before him.

The dull gold rod was long and thin with a mysterious insignia imprinted on its body.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew about the dull gold rod!

He had even used it personally before, although it was just an imitation.

Weng!

The dull gold rod moved over a long distance and appeared before Jian Wushuang in a blink of an eye under the control of Xiang Yi’s soul power.

Immediately after, the dull gold rod was like a majestic and huge mountain that came smashing down on Jian Wushuang ferociously.

The power encompassed within the rod was sufficient to throw an ordinary Third Grade Divine Demon into despair.

Jian Wushuang was also surprised but still swung out the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand at the first moment.

A unique sword intention swept across and the Mixed Elements Spirit was used.

Dang!

That dull gold rod clashed violently onto the Blood Mountain Sword, sending terrifying force through the tremors of the Blood Mountain Sword.

Jian Wushuang staggered back and sank to the ground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Xiang Yi didn’t just stop there. That dull gold rod grew rapidly before smashing down on Jian Wushuang relentlessly.

Strike after strike, he wasn’t going to allow Jian Wushuang to catch his breath.

Jian Wushuang could only use his sword technique to withstand the relentless attack of the dull gold rod. However, there was a clear difference in strength since the beginning and the dull gold rod had an emphasis on absolute strength. Under these conditions, Jian Wushuang had a hard time withstanding the attacks.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

The numerous violent clashes threw Jian Wushuang into a building within Lin Mansion, destroying everything in the process.

However, Xiang Yi didn’t just stop there.

“Die! Die!!” Xiang Yi’s eyes had turned blood red. Brutality and craziness were gleaming in his eyes and he continued smashing down on Jian Wushuang with his dull gold rod.

Terrifying explosions erupted and everyone could sense the immense power encompassed within the dull gold rod.

“Shuang!”

“Nephew Wushuang!”

Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng were flabbergasted. There was nothing they could do. The duo from the Xiang Family and the remaining experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect had intercepted them a long time ago. There was no way Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng could find an opportunity to interrupt.

“Fire Fairy, is there something you can do?” asked Lin Tiefeng.

At this juncture, they could only hope the Thunder Sound Sect could help Jian Wushuang.

“Lin Family Head, you should know about the circumstances of our Thunder Sound Sect. We extended our invitation multiple times but Jian Wushuang chose to refuse each time. There’s no reason for the Thunder Sound Sect to step in. Moreover, even if our Thunder Sound Sect were to step in at this juncture, it would be too late. The Golden Cauldron Sect has sent two Second Grade Divine Demons here. There’s nothing I can do,” Fire Fairy answered honestly.

She really wanted to bring the absolute talent, Jian Wushuang, back to Thunder Sound Sect. If Jian Wushuang had accepted the invitation at the beginning, she would have tried her best to come up with something. It was a shame that Jian Wushuang had chosen to reject her offer.

Now that Jian Wushuang was in a difficult situation and Xiang Yi clearly wouldn’t stop, she couldn’t save Jian Wushuang even if he agreed to join Thunder Sound Sect. As such, the only feeling she had for him was pity.

“An unprecedented talent is going to be wasted here.” Fire Fairy sighed emotionally. “You can’t really blame me for it. He’s just too conceited. If he had chosen to join a sect earlier, he wouldn’t be in this predicament.”

At this moment, the relentless attacks from the dull gold rod finally came to a halt.

Xiang Yi stood upright and had the dull gold rod beside him. He was looking down to the ground in front of him.

At that place, the initial building, including the other structures around it, had been reduced to powder under his crushing divine power. The surface of the ground had been destroyed and replaced by a large pothole. The surface of the pothole wasn’t smooth, clearly suggesting it wasn’t caused by a single impact but continuous domineering strength.

Everyone focused on the pothole.

Is Jian Wushuang dead?

Many people had this thought in mind.

Obviously, many were in shock.

“He’s too strong. Is this the strength of a Second Grade Divine Demon?”

“A Second Grade Divine Demon is way stronger than a Third Grade Divine Demon!”

“Jian Wushuang could kill Third Grade Divine Demon and would be considered really strong. However, the difference between a Second Grade Divine Demon and him is still too huge.”

Many people were whispering and feeling a little despondent.

They were sad to see a true demon-like genius meet his end here.

Just as almost everyone was certain that Jian Wushuang had fallen under the barrage of rod attacks...

Rumble~~~

Beneath the pothole, debris scattered fiercely and a figure rose from the bottom gradually.

Soon, he was standing before Xiang Yi again.

“How can this be possible?”

Staring at Jian Wushuang, Xiang Yi was in disbelief.

To take revenge for his sister, he was seething with killing intent. Previously, he had gone all-out and had maximized the power in each relentless attack.

Under such terrifying attacks, even if he managed to survive, Jian Wushuang should at least be severely injured.

However, the current Jian Wushuang looked a little wretched with some blood at the edge of his mouth, but his aura had not seemed to weaken at all.

Clearly, he had not sustained considerable injuries during the relentless barrage of attacks.

“This... This...”

The surrounding crowd was equally astounded.

In their eyes, even a Third Grade Divine Demon’s self defence mechanism would have given way under that barrage of attacks. However, Jian Wushuang was just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm.

Not only had he survived, he had only sustained light injuries?

What they didn’t know was that although Xiang Yi’s attacks were strong, the true impact of them that reached Jian Wushuang was limited.

Together with Jian Wushuang’s self defence mechanism, his Holy Body was way above the level of an ordinary Third Grade Divine Demon even without wearing armor.

How could the Holy Body of a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform be so easily damaged after mastering the first scroll of the Immemorial Celestial Body?

“If I’m not mistaken, you are using the Hong Jun Divine Rod.” Jian Wushuang was staring at Xiang Yi, or more accurately, the dull gold rod before him.

The Hong Jun Divine Rod was a weapon that shared the same fame as the Hong Jun Golden Swords. They could be manipulated with soul power.

In his previous life, Jian Wushuang had encountered Long Qi in the Eighth Lair. From Long Qi, he had obtained an imitation of Hong Jun Golden Swords.

At that time, in order for him to master the Hong Jun Golden Swords, Long Qi had given him the imitation Hong Jun Golden Swords to practice with.
