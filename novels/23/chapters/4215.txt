4216 The Fifth City

When Jian Wushuang became the First City’s Governor, he also said, “In a grand palace in the eighth city.”

There were a few candles in the hall, and the dim yellow light of the candles flickered, making the hall look rather gloomy.

A devilish young man with long black hair draped over his shoulders was sitting on a large chair in a relaxed manner.

Beneath him were two peak Ultimate Rulers. They trembled as they bent their backs and knelt at his feet like servants.

!!

“Master, that Bone Armor guy is dead.”

The servant on the left said carefully.

“Oh? Who did it?”

The evil-looking young man raised his eyebrows.

“Master, this profound light mirror has recorded the scene when that Bone Armor fellow was killed.”

The servant lowered his head, moved his knees, and carefully handed over a dark light mirror.

“Yes.”

The demonic young man nodded and took the dark light mirror. He looked down and saw that it was playing the scene of Jian Wushuang crushing Ruler Bone Armor to death.

After a while.

The devilish young man pinched the dark light mirror with his slender fingers, and it immediately shattered into pieces.

“What trash. Not even a fifth-stage chief Ruler is a match for him.”

The devilish young man snorted in disdain. He then raised his head as a look of contemplation flashed in his eyes.

“This person’s name is Blood Sword, right…”

Du, du, du.

His fingers were rhythmically tapping on the armrest of the chair.

When the two servants saw this, they did not even dare to breathe loudly.

A moment later, the evil-looking young man lowered his head and looked at the two peak Ultimate Rulers kneeling in front of him. He said indifferently, “The two of you, head to the Fifth City to stop Blood Sword. If you can’t bring his head back, you don’t have to come back. Do you understand?”

The two servants trembled when they heard this.

“Yes, master.”

“Yes, Your Majesty! The two servants quickly responded and respectfully took their leave.”

After the two servants left, the already gloomy hall became even colder.

The devilish young man shook his head. He leaned back on the chair and slowly closed his eyes.

At the same time, in the distant Divine Life Palace.

The mist was faint, and a pot of warm spiritual tea was boiling on a stone table. The Ruler Blood Wave and the Supreme Giant Axe were sitting opposite each other, chatting and laughing.

After the tea was completely boiled.

“Giant Axe, come and have a taste. I’ve specially asked a good friend to take this tea from the first tea tree in the universe. It has a miraculous effect of calming the mind.” The Blood Wave Ruler rolled up his sleeves and poured a cup of tea as he smiled.

Supreme Giant Axe curled his lips upon hearing this. He had never been very interested in drinking tea. He only felt that it was a waste of time to take it slow.

Gulp.

Supreme Giant Axe picked up the cup of tea and gulped it down like a cow.

The Blood Wave Ruler chuckled and shook his head when he saw this. however, he didn’t mind. He and Giant Axe Ruler had been good friends for many years and had always understood his character.

He picked up the teacup and sipped the spiritual tea in it. He smiled and said, “Giant Axe, have you been paying attention to the news from the ancient path of stars?”

“What news?” Supreme Giant Axe raised his eyebrows and asked.

The Blood Wave Ruler clapped his hands and laughed. “Three days ago, I received a message from a good friend on the Supreme ancient path of stars. Something big happened with the Ninth Kalpa King.”

“What’s the big deal?” There was a hint of doubt in Supreme Giant Axe’s eyes. Could it be that something had happened to the Ninth Kalpa King?

However, looking at the Blood Wave’s expression, it did not seem like something had happened to the Ninth Kalpa King.

The Blood Wave Ruler smiled and said, “The Ninth Kalpa King killed Supreme fixed light!”

“What? The Ninth Kalpa King killed Supreme fixed light?” Supreme Giant Axe was startled upon hearing this.

He had heard of Supreme dingguang before. He was not very powerful and was considered to be at the bottom of the Supreme-being realm. However, he was still a genuine Supreme-being! It was extremely difficult to kill them!

The fall of a Supreme-being was a world-shaking event for the entire universe.

“The Ninth Kalpa King has just stepped into the supremacy stage, but he’s already able to kill a supremacy of the same level? Is this news true?” Giant Axe Ruler said with slight disbelief.

The Blood Wave Ruler nodded and smiled. “This matter has already spread throughout the Ruler starry sky ancient road. Naturally, it can’t be false.”

The Ruler Blood Wave paused for a moment and laughed bitterly. he seemed to be laughing at himself, but he also seemed to be pleased. “Perfect-level living beings truly are extraordinary. When I first broke through to the Ruler level, I had to spend an entire chaos cycle in secluded meditation before I was able to fully control my transformed Ruler divine body.”

“Hahaha, Blood Wave, we supreme martial artists who relied on hard work to reach this stage naturally can’t compare to those heaven’s favorites in terms of talent.” Supreme Giant Axe laughed heartily and changed the topic. “This time, it’s very likely that the Ninth Kalpa King will be able to go to the universe gathering of all races with us.”

The Blood Wave Ruler replied with an ‘en’ before saying, as long as the Ninth Kalpa King does not die on the Supreme starry sky ancient road, the chances of him participating in the Grand gathering of all races in the universe should be very high.

After a pause, the Blood Wave Ruler sighed and raised his head. “Jian Wushuang should have entered the ancient path of stars by now. I just don’t know how he’s doing. After all, the competition on the Ruler ancient path of stars is far more intense than the Ruler ancient path of stars.”

“I knew it. You’re worried about Jian Wushuang.” The Blood Wave Ruler smiled and continued, “Don’t worry. Jian Wushuang has always been smart. We don’t need to worry about him.”

“That’s true.” The Blood Wave Ruler smiled and said, “After Ninth Kalpa King killed Supreme fixed light, I’m looking forward to seeing what Jian Wushuang will be like after he breaks through to the Supreme level.”

“I think he should be similar to the Ninth Kalpa King.” Giant Axe Ruler replied.

The Blood Wave Ruler shook his head with a smile and did not reply.

He was the only one who knew that Jian Wushuang was a special creature that was a perfect creature!

If Jian Wushuang broke through to the Supreme level, he would probably be much stronger than the current Ninth Kalpa King.

….

Time passed by. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the blink of an eye, sixty years had passed.

At the city gates of the Fifth City on the ancient path of the starry sky.

The void suddenly distorted. Then, a young man in a black robe, a hood, and a red sword case on his back stepped out of the void and stepped into the Fifth City.

There was a chubby yellow-robed cultivator beside the young man.

“Blood Sword, this is the Fifth City.”

The chubby yellow-robed cultivator said with a sneer.

“Yes.”

The black-haired young man nodded and looked around. The Fifth City was bustling with activity. There were markets, restaurants, and everything one could think of. Many Ultimate Rulers were passing by in a hurry on the streets.

This person was Jian Wushuang, who had been around for 60 years!
