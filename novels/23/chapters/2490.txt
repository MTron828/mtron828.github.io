Chapter 2491: Conditions

“Instrument cultivation materials?”

Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian looked at each other and thought it was not a big deal.

The Great Compassion Sect was able to provide some cultivation materials of course.

“I wonder what kind of materials are you looking for?” Yun Zhen asked.

“Four portions of Red Sun Secret Essence, five Red Blood Fruits, two drops of Purple Shimmer, a hundred pieces of Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and ten thousand pounds of Celestial Iron Ore,” said Jian Wushuang.

The three Supreme Elders were dumbfounded when they heard his request.

Various sects’ experts were also shocked beyond words.

Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Purple Shimmer, Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and Celestial Iron Ore. All of them were difficult to find!

Jian Wushuang was asking that much in one go?

“Boy, are you trying to put us in an awkward position? All of these are rare materials. Don’t tell me you’re planning to cultivate a Heavenly Treasure! Even cultivating regular Heavenly Treasure doesn’t require such rare materials,” Lei Chong said in anger.

“I’m not trying to embarrass the Great Compassion Sect. I genuinely need those materials,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang planned on using those materials to cultivate his Life Armor.

He requested Wujian to look for it before, but he could not find any of them.

“Don’t tell me the Great Compassion Sect can’t even provide some of the materials?” Jian Wushuang jeered.

Yun Zhen pondered for a while before raising his head and said, “Of the materials you asked, we do have Celestial Iron Ore and Red Blood Fruit and can provide them anytime. As for Red Sun Secret Essence, we only have three portions but it shouldn’t be hard to find another portion. Spectacular Beast’s Scale may prove challenging to obtain. I’m afraid the entire Wusha Wilderness may not even have a hundred pieces, but we can use our influence to search for them in other territories. It may take a few months to half a year before we can gather the quantity you asked for.”

“I’m afraid the troublesome one is only the Purple Shimmer.”

“Can you find it?” Jian Wushuang looked at Yun Zhen.

He knew that among all those instrument cultivation materials, Purple Shimmer was the rarest and hardest to find.

“The Great Compassion Sect only has one drop of Purple Shimmer. As for the second drop, I know who has it, but it’s not easy to get it from him. However, I’ll try my best to ask for it. If I can’t get it from him, there’s nothing else I can do,” said Yun Zhen directly.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Two drops of Purple Shimmer was what he needed, but being able to get even one drop was quite fortuitous while the second drop would depend solely on luck.

“Other than these instrument cultivation materials, I would also need some Primordial Stones,” said Jian Wushuang.

Primordial Stones contained pure divine powers. Every single one of them had an extraordinarily high content of divine powers.

In the market, a Primordial Stone was comparable to about 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power and that was purely from a conversion aspect.

Primordial Stones contained the purest form of divine powers. It was even purer than those 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power. Jian Wushuang had tasted the benefit before in Divine Power Ocean within Saint’s Tomb, so he wanted to rely on his terrifying absorption speed and tempering of divine powers to raise his cultivation stage.

Naturally, he needs to have enough divine powers to do so.

Absorbing and tempering divine powers from Primordial Stones were more convenient and effective than absorbing Ancient God Divine Power.

“How many Primordial Stones do you need?” Yun Zhen looked over.

“Not many, ten thousand would suffice,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Ten thousand?” Yun Zhen was dumbfounded.

“Jian Wushuang, how dare you to say that ten thousand Primordial Stones is not many?” Lei Chong immediately roared.

“Why? Is that a lot?” Jian Wushuang looked strange.

The Primordial Stones was a request he made according to his needs. He had just reached the Second-Class Divine Demon and needed a huge amount of divine powers to upgrade himself into a First-Class Divine Demon. He estimated that 10,000 Primordial Stones would be enough to make a breakthrough, hence the request. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, it seemed like he had asked too much.

“Jian Wushuang, the number of Primordial Stones you ask for is truly too many. You need to know that the market value for a single piece of Primordial Stone is equivalent to ten thousand Ancient God Divine Power. Many Peak Divine Demons couldn’t afford it even after using up all their wealth. Even though the Great Compassion Sect has an extraordinary foundation and is the first-ranked sect in Wusha Wilderness, it’s impossible to present ten thousand pieces of Primordial Stones in one go,” said Yun Zhen.

Lei Chong was hot-headed and immediately growled coldly. “Even when making an offering every millennium to the Territorial Lord of Wilderness, the Great Compassion Sect only offers up to a thousand Primordial Stones. Who are you to ask that many from us?”

“Shut up.” Yun Zhen glancing at Lei Chong.

Lei Chong held his tongue despite feeling furious.

Yun Zhen was quite kind to Jian Wushuang, but that was out of necessity. Normally, he was extremely overbearing to others.

Although Lei Chong was a Supreme Elder, he was still very respectful and fearful of Yun Zhen.

“It looks like my requests are a bit overboard,” said Jian Wushuang anxiously.

Yun Zhen looked at him again. “What do you think about this, Jian Wushuang? There are many sects that have offended you. The Great Compassion Sect will discuss with them and offer you three thousand pieces of Primordial Stones.”

The Great Compassion Sect could at most only offer three thousand Primordial Stones after discussing it with the other sects. If the request for three thousand Primordial Stones were solely directed at the Great Compassion Sect, it would have been a huge loss.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “That’s fine. I have one last request.”

“Do tell.” Yun Zhen was being very patient.

“Lord Yun Zhen would’ve probably guessed I would be leaving Wusha Wilderness soon and adventure to other territories, but I’m afraid that as soon as I leave Wusha Wilderness, the safety of my family could be at stake. Hence, my last request toward the Great Compassion Sect is to guarantee their safety. Otherwise, regardless of what the reasons are, I’ll blame the Great Compassion Sect if my family is harmed.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was frosty.

That condition was made to ensure the safety of his family.

In the end, he had run-ins with way too many sects and severely injured many of them. Although they were shocked by his abilities and would not do anything upfront, those who held grudges might use dirty tactics as soon as he left Wusha Wilderness. He did not wish to see Zhuo Yunfeng and his wife being harmed when he returned next time.
