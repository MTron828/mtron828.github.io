Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bam!

The mighty golden saber shadow and Jian Wushuang’s all-out Heaven’s Bane clashed.

Generally, Jian Wushuang was able to beat ordinary Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm. But Celestial Master Jin Yi was much stronger than that.

As they clashed, Jian Wushuang’s Heaven’s Bane immediately collapsed.

On the other hand, the golden saber shadow was only slightly weakened. Subsequently, Jin Yi brandished his machete one more time. At that moment, he had covered Jian Wushuang’s entire body.

Boom!

The blade light sailed through the Void and pushed Jian Wushuang under the ground.

“Did he die?” Celestial Master Jin Yi observed the ground emotionlessly.

Bang! A scarlet-robe figure surged from under the ground, stirring many gravels. He appeared in front of Jin Yi one more time.

Jian Wushuang’s scarlet-robe rustled. His eyes were crimson and his Killing Intent had grown intenser.

Like an immortal master, he stood in the Void.

Both Jin Kingdom and Green Fire Palace Celestial Masters were all stunned by the scene.

“What’s going on?”

“Impossible. That’s absolutely impossible!!”

Strong as the elder was, he and the middle-aged man with a cloud-like mark both find it unbelievable.

“His aura isn’t impaired?” A gasp escaped Celestial Master Jin Yi.

Normally, Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm were unable to fend off his best move. Celestial Master Green Wolf who mastered defense skills might fail to take the hit as well.

But Jian Wushuang did.

Moreover, he was not even blood-stained. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

His aura stayed the same.

Even, Jian Wushuang was looking murderous now as if he would go to ant length to fight back.

How was that possible?

Swoosh!

A female figure showed up in front of Jian Wushuang. They were Celestial Master An and Celestial Master Yin Tong who came to his rescue.

Moreover, many formidable Celestial Masters appeared beside Jian Wushuang in a row to protect him.

All Jin Kingdom experts looked helpless.

“Jian Wushuang, good move!” Celestial Master An stared at Jian Wushuang in astonishment. She sounded appreciative.

Green Fire Palace experts were all stunned and looked at Jian Wushuang in awe.

And the power of Jian Wushuang justified their reverence for him.

“Jian Wushuang.” Celestial Master Green Wolf caught up with Jian Wushuang. “Sorry. I was trying to take the Nirvana Elixirs. Fortunately, I didn’t. Otherwise…”

It was true. If he took the Nirvana Elixir, Celestial Master Jin Yi would be targeting him. However, he did not have the confidence to ward off Celestial Master Jin Yi’s Dragon Slayer.

Hearing Celestial Master Green Wolf, Jian Wushuang retracted his Killing Intent and nodded slightly. “I think I’m better in terms of defense, otherwise, I would’ve passed them to you without a doubt. After all, we all come from Green Fire Palace. I won’t be selfish and take all the elixirs.”

“Sorry, I got you wrong.” Celestial Master Green Wolf apologized.

Many other Green Fire Palace experts also misunderstood him.

They thought Jian Wushuang kept the elixirs because he was selfish and wanted to keep the three elixirs to himself. Well, now they knew he had a plan.

“Well, we’ll stop here.” Celestial Master An waved and said, “Of the six Nirvana Elixirs, we get four. That’s really something.”

Other Green Fire Palace experts looked delighted as well.

Between the present two sides, Green Fire Place had an advantage. They thought three elixirs would suffice.

At present, four Nirvana Elixirs had greatly exceeded expectations.

Of course, Jian Wushuang contributed a lot to their achievement!

On the contrary, the Jin Kingdom experts all looked gloomy. Many vicious eyes were fixed upon Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s him again!”

“In the fight of Life Elixirs, he killed nearly 20 of our Celestial Masters and obtain a lot of medicines. Now, because of him, we get only two elixirs!”

“He’s such a nuisance!”

“Where does he come from? And why is his aura only in Eternal Realm?”

The crowd complained and cursed. The four Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm all gathered and glared at Jian Wushuang, teeth-gritted.

They were unwilling to accept the result. They were at a disadvantage, and they should have gotten more Life Elixirs and Nirvana Elixirs.

But because of Jian Wushuang, they did not get their share and lost more than they had expected.

Nevertheless, no matter how furious and resentful they felt, they could only watch. After all, they could not touch Jian Wushuang.

Although he had been besieged, he survived and even remained his strong aura. Now that Celestial Master An, Celestial Master Yin Tong, Celestial Master Green Wolf had joined forces with him, they were less likely to kill Jian Wushuang.

At this moment…

“Hmm?”

Celestial Master Jin Yi discovered something, and then he became elated.

At the next moment, swoosh!

Wind-breaking sound rang… A ghost-like figure in a black robe appeared on the battlefield out of nowhere.

Seeing the figure, all Jin Kingdom experts looked delightfully surprised and bowed in respect.

“Heaven Shadow King!”

“Heaven Shadow King!”

Their greetings resounded over the sky.

Green Fire Palace experts all looked stunned at the sight of this.

“Bad luck, it’s Heaven Shadow King of the Nine Kings of the Jin Kingdom!”

“This looks bad. He’s an expert who can compare to our five Palace Masters!”

“Heaven Shadow King actually came?”

All Green Fire Palace Celestial Masters were terrified. Even Celestial Master An, Celestial Master Yin Tong, and Celestial Master Green Wolf flustered.

Inside Jian Wushuang, Gu King’s voice cracked as well at the sight of the figure.

“A Universe Master!”
