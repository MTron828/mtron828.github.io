Chapter 1003: The Sky-devouring Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The black clouds dissipated over them, disintegrating as the figure of a person dressed in black revealed itself.

Fully cloaked in jet-black robes, it was an old man with black mysterious cracks littered around his gnarly and creased face.

The mysterious cracks looked strange and unusual, adding to the already ghastly and malevolent presence of the elder.

A terrifying and devilish aura emanated strongly from him.

“Hahaha… Here we have a member of the Winged Dragon Clan… One who has become a Rank Three Dao Master…” The black-robed elder stared intently at the Dragon Wing Governor. His tongue dangled maniacally from his mouth as he licked his lips hungrily.

“The Winged Dragon Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed questioningly as he peered at the Dragon Wing Governor standing beside him.

“It is me that he is after.” The Dragon Wing Governor muttered as he narrowed his eyes.

“Far and wide I’ve traveled the Samsara Continent. For so many years I have consumed and feasted on the flesh of countless bloodlines. But never have I sampled the taste of one of the Winged Dragon Bloodline. At any rate, I will have you today.” The black-robed elder grinned wickedly. The next instant, he transformed himself into a dark gossamer apparition, hurtling towards the Dragon Wing Governor swiftly.

Jian Wushuang was completely been overlooked as if he never existed.

The Dragon Wing Governor’s expression changed at the sight of the black wraith-like mass charging at him. He could feel the staggering presence of the savage old man that left him frozen with panic. The elder was undoubtedly a Rank Three Dao Master; one who wielded incredibly powerful strengths.

A fear he never once felt crept into his heart, paralyzing him with fright and hysteria.

It was a sensation of intense fear that tingled from the blood of the Winged Dragon in his veins.

It was like the panic by a prey when was stalked upon by its predator.

“He is after me, Jian Wushuang. Leave me and run!” The Dragon Wing Governor shouted out to Jian Wushuang frantically as he turned into a crimson lightning bolt that immediately shot into the air and fled!

“The Dragon Wing Governor had escaped without even a fight?”?Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised.

Jian Wushuang had noticed that the black-robed elder was a Rank Three Dao Master, as was the Dragon Wing Governor. There should still be ample chance for a fight, for they were of equal rank. The differences between their strengths would hardly be huge.

“Hmph, he has made a right choice.”

The Gu King’s voice rose suddenly.?“Unless I am very much mistaken, the old man in black possesses the bloodline of the Sky-devouring Clan. This clan is well-known in the Eternal Chaotic World for being a fierce population that lives on the Essence Blood of Exotic Beasts. Common Exotic Beasts will be struck with a strange sensation of innate panic at the sight of one of the Sky-devouring Clan, like how a prey would freeze with extreme fear when encountering a predator.”

“With the extreme stress and anxiety inflicted upon the Governor, no amount of strength will be able to help him defeat the old man in black. The battle has been lost even before it begun.”

“Is that so?”?Jian Wushuang wondered, bewildered and amazed.

“Then again, the kins of the Sky-devouring Clan are rarely seen even in the Eternal Chaotic World. I didn’t expect to see one of the Sky-devouring Clan here in this world.”?The Gu King mused with interest.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang noticed that the figure of the black-robed elder shook violently. A huge pair of wings, black, strong and webbed, sprouted from his back suddenly. With his speed doubled, the old man shot through the air with his wings flapping relentlessly, trying to catch up to the Dragon Wing Governor.

“Ah… One of the Sky-devouring Clan that possesses the heredity of bats. Their lack of great strength is compensated by immense speed. The Dragon Wing Governor is in danger.”?The Gu King clicked his tongue in admiration.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. He too could see that the Governor was in a desperate fight for his life, but he had not made any move to help his companion.

Because, he sensed that their enemy numbered more than one.

“Would you not show yourself, since you’ve come.” Jian Wushuang called with his voice spread around.

As his voice began to trail off, the air near him shimmered, revealing a handsome man dressed in a robe of golden silk.

“And how can I be of assistance, Mr Jin Yu?” Jian Wushuang asked as he regarded the handsome man coldly.

The man, beyond all doubt, was none other than Jin Yu.

“Hahaha… Nothing. I’m only curious to know how could a mere an Eternal Realm youngling as you could so nonchalantly produce two Chaos Gems. Let me guess… you still have more, right?” Jin Yu grinned thinly.

“Yes, I do.” Jian Wushuang nodded indifferently.

Overjoyed, Jin Yu continued, grinning widely. “One Chaos Gem is more than equal to the entire fortune of a Rank Three Dao Master. Would there not be dangers if you were to keep such fortune with you? Why would you not allow me to guard them in your stead?”

“You are right. Such fortune is not safe with me.” Jian Wushuang murmured. With a flick of his wrist, the unique glow of more than ten gems radiated brightly as they spewed from the mouth of his sleeves and hovered in mid-air between them.

Jin Yu felt his heart throbbed, beating with an anxiousness of greed and yearning at the sight of the riches before him.

Without a doubt, these were all Chaos Gems!

“The brat has an entire trove of them!”?Jin Yu felt his body quivered with excitement.

“The Chaos Gems are right here, Mr Jin Yu. If you want them so badly, why don’t you come and claim them?” Jian Wushuang said in a soft voice, the edges of his lips twisting into a suggestive but yet devilish grin.

“I see… I will just be done with all the theatrics then.” Jin Yu smiled wickedly. He waved his hand, summoning a strong gust of blowing wind that swept towards the Chaos Gems suspended in stasis, threatening to whisk them away.

The gems floated lazily in the air. The strong currents of air surged at them, ensnaring them and buffeted them towards the direction of the waiting Jin Yu.

Jin Yu could not help feeling overjoyed and jubilant at the impending hoard of riches rolling at him.

But just then… “Whoosh!”

Like a ghastly phantom, Jian Wushuang emerged in front of him abruptly.

There was nothing but cold fury glinting in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He brandished the Blood Mountain Sword, channeling an immense amount of Ancient God Power that churned wildly in his blade as Jian Wushuang readied himself for an assault so powerful and terrible.

“Hmph!”

With a loud snort that thundered forth, Jian Wushuang swung his blade with rage at his foe.

The stroke, with a force that tore the Void asunder, arced dangerously at Jin Yu.

Unperturbed by this, Jin Yu scoffed with disdain, “You dare unleash your feeble might at me? You, a merely weakling of the Eternal Realm!”

Heeding at Jian Wushuang’s incoming attack with contempt, he flailed his sleeve, throwing forth a translucent flash of light; an auric blade that smote at Jian Wushuang’s sword.

It was a stroke that Jin Yu casually cast forth, yet it held enough force to easily annihilate any warrior of the Eternal Realm.

Not Dao Masters of Rank One, be it a common Rank One or one who was close to reaching Rank Two, could hope to escape unscathed.

He meant to put Wushuang to death and he was clearly certain that the force of his stroke was enough to complete the deed.

Therefore, Jin Yu did not cast even a glance at his quarry after performing his lethal reprisal.

He was confident that the stroke would kill Jian Wushuang.

What happened next, however, left him in complete shock and disbelief.
