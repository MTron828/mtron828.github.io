Chapter 5076 Accidental Encounter

The sound of Chang Fu's voice echoed in his mind, repeating incessantly for a long time.

In the midst of the empty void and the gale of the void, the once shattered Immortal body of Jian Wushuang was visibly restoring itself at a remarkable speed.

In just a few dozen breaths, it had fully recovered.

And in his arms, Nan Xuan, who had been lying motionless, opened his eyes at this moment and exclaimed, "Could it be? You're really not dead?"

Jian Wushuang nodded calmly. Long before he made his move, Changfu had secretly informed him during their conversation that he should feign death to avoid the entanglement of Prince JIu.

This was also the reason why Jian Wushuang 'died' so easily.

"It's terrifying. How can there be such beings in the Great Domain?" Nan Xuan, who had come back to life, said with lingering fear.

This was his first time being in such close contact with a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

After ascending to the Grand Yan Immortal realm, each transformation was like a deep abyss, and the pressure brought upon Nan Xuan by the Nine Revolutions was something he fundamentally could not resist.

That was also the reason why Nan Xuan was so astonished.

Because Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals could only exist in that Ancient Era.

In the end, the War of Emperors came to an end, and the Immortals were annihilated.

"There are some things that cannot be explained in a few words. What we can do now is to leave."

Jian Wushuang said calmly. He stood up slowly in the chaotic and violent void gales.

Nan Xuan also got up and looked at his retreating figure with a pensive expression.

The void gales could cause some harm to Yan Immortals, but for a Grand Yan Immortal, it was like a mere itch.

In order to avoid the detection of his own Yan Power, Jian Wushuang signaled Nan Xuan to suppress his Yan power. They then disappeared into the turbulent flow along with the raging void gales.

"Young Friend, do you think we'll be swept to some unknown place by this gale?"

"I'm not too sure. Since the astral winds are in Great Mi Heaven, it should stay within this range."

"Then wouldn't we be dragged into this for quite a long time?"

"Perhaps."

...

Due to the severe fragmentation of the void, the gust of wind became even more violent, showing no signs of following any rules.

Huge vortexes rotated in the shattered void, and stars faded away.

These void gusts could cause considerable damage to lower-level Yan Immortals, but their harm to the Grand Yan Immortals was almost negligible.

However, due to the previous battle, Nan Xuan suffered some injuries from Changfu's finger attack.

Although he did not fall,?he could not release his Yan power to protect himself, so he quickly fainted again.

As for Jian Wushuang, the void winds could not break his defense at all. Despite his Immortal body not having Yan power, the gales did not affect him at all.

Thus, he held Nan Xuan with one arm and shuttled through the violent void winds like a fish swimming in water.

Since Sword Wushuang didn't have much knowledge about the Great Mi Heaven, he had no choice but to move blindly, allowing the gusts of the void to carry them anywhere.

Under such a battle, the peripheral Heavenly Regions of the Great Mi Heaven fell into chaos, with the void shattered, and all the Heavenly Regions were in turmoil.

Floating within the gusty vortexes, it was unknown how much time had passed before Jian Wushuang felt the gusts of the void tearing at his Immortal body gradually dissipate, and the force supporting his floatation disappeared.

It was like falling into boundless darkness, everything turning dim.

But this unknown dimness lasted for less than ten breaths of time before suddenly clearing up.

Sword Wushuang quietly opened his eyes.

Faint flowing clouds reflected in his eyes, along with a unique crimson color that was characteristic of the morning glow.

This was a peculiar Heavenly Region Plane!

...

"Senior Brother, look up there, something's in the sky!"

"No, something's wrong with the sky, it's changing!"

"Run, I think the sky is collapsing..."

Amidst the clamor, the chaotic sounds of people splashing in the water echoed continuously.

About 40 to 50 bare-chested men carrying baskets on their backs were running along the shore.

Clearly, they had all noticed the strange changes in the sky and were hurrying to escape.

At this moment, the youngest and most inexperienced disciple cried out in panic, "Senior Brother, w-what about our sword blanks..."

The burly man leading the group turned back and urgently replied, "Run, it's too late for that now, we can't worry about it at a time like this, let's go back and see our Master!"

Hearing this, the young disciple gritted his teeth and bent down to pick up four or five sword blanks before quickly catching up with the group.

They ran frantically along the riverbank, all the men watching the sky with deep concern.

At this moment, the sky above them had already developed numerous fine cracks, and crimson fiery clouds covered the entire sky.

Moreover, in the center, a violent whirlpool began to surge as if it could shatter at any moment.

In the next moment, the raging whirlpool seemed to have reached its breaking point and began to collapse.

A crimson pillar of light, ten thousand feet in size, suddenly pierced through the sky, illuminating the entire earth.

As far as the eye could see, everything was filled with a hazy golden light.

All the men running halted in their tracks, unable to believe what they were witnessing.

They realized that although the sky had broken, the destructive force that seemed unstoppable had not harmed anything.

Furthermore, these rays of light existed for only an instant, then retreated like tides, disappearing without a trace.

"Is this... is this a dream?" the muscular man at the front exclaimed in disbelief.

But soon he realized that it was not a dream but a reality.

Because although the sky had been repaired, the cracks that had not yet disappeared were still visible.

At this moment, the young disciple holding the sword blanks whispered in astonishment, "Master, look at the water!"

Following his outstretched finger, everyone turned their gaze towards the surface of the water.

There, hovering above the vast expanse of water, was a figure.

A figure dressed in simple attire, with a faint golden radiance flowing around him, exuding an indescribable aura of power.

And in his arms, he cradled a figure in black, silently suspended above the water.

The leader of the muscular men's pupils contracted as he saw the powerful figure approaching them.

In the face of such a formidable presence, not to mention confrontation, they could barely stand steady.

All the muscular men's faces turned pale, and they kept retreating.

Splash!

Due to nervousness, the young disciple carrying the sword blanks slipped and fell into the water along with his cargo.

In the next moment, thousands of threads of faint golden radiance quietly emerged from the water, lifting the young disciple out of the water along with the sword blanks.

"Junior Brother!" the muscular man exclaimed in shock, attempting to reach out and rescue him, but they found an invisible barrier separating them.

And so, thousands of radiance threads carried the young disciple towards the center of the river.

"Young Friend, pardon the intrusion. What place is this?"

"This... is where my master resides, called the Sancun Mountain..."

"Sancun Mountain?"
