Chapter 2148 The Sudden Decisive Battle

On Thunderbolt Island, Eternal Chaotic World, countless experts waited in silence.Finally, the power of spacetime created a huge Spacetime Tunnel above Thunderbolt Island.

The experts’ eyes all lit up at the sight of the tunnel.

Xiu!

Emperor Bai and the countless Great Emperors from both alliances appeared in front of the tunnel immediately.

Looking at the tunnel in front of him, Emperor Bai’s eyes lit up. His voice echoed around Thunderbolt Island.

“The Great Battle has arrived!”

“Fellow warriors, let us slaughter our way into the Three Emperors World to eradicate Eternal Chaotic World’s largest tumour! Die!”

Emperor Bai was the first to step into the Timespace Tunnel.

The countless experts behind him did not hesitate and followed suit.

Countless more Almighties entered as well.

…

The Void above the Imperial City.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu felt something was amiss when the huge Spacetime Tunnel appeared.

They could tell the tunnel was extraordinary.

It was too big. The Power of Spacetime was too strong.

Jian Wushuang would not use such a big Spacetime Tunnel to escape.

And with what Jian Wushuang had just said…

As Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu were lost in thought, Xiu! A figured appeared from the other side of the tunnel.

He had white hair and white pupils, his fair complexion was terrifying as well.

No aura came from him, but he still found himself under the spotlight.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu could not help but fix their eyes upon that person.

“Emperor Bai!” Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu were flustered.

Both of them have fought against Emperor Bai before, they knew how terrifying he was.

Now, Emperor Bai stood before them once again.

And it was not just Emperor Bai. Figure after figure appeared from the tunnel.

Red Dragon King, Ancestor Tian Chen, Colored Glaze Emperor, East Royal Emperor and other Great Emperors from the Sanctuary Alliance.

King Luo Yu, King Zhan Cang, An Quan and other Great Emperors from the Special Tribes Alliance.

There were over twenty people.

Following them were countless Almighties. The number alone was shocking.

Within a short period of time, all the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World arrived at the Imperial City through the Spacetime Tunnel.

“This, this…”

The fact that Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Ba Su were Third Stage Great Emperors did not stop them from gasping at the sight of so many figures.

Not to mention the other Three Emperors World experts.

They completely froze.

Emperor Bai’s intention was clear as day.

“Everyone, let the slaughter begin!” A faint sound came from Emperor Bai.

The twenty Great Emperors and four thousand-odd Almighties moved.

“Die!” “Die!” “Die!” “Kill them all!” The cries resonated across the entire Imperial City.

The figures headed for the Three Emperors World experts like a swarm of bees.

This had many Three Emperors World experts dumbfounded.

“Crap!” “The final battle!” It was the final battle! “The final battle has begun!”

Voices of terror could be felt from the Three Emperors World experts.

And indeed, it had begun.

But the battle was so sudden, the enemy was not prepared for it at all.

Technically they had begun their preparations quite a while back, but they had never expected the Eternal Chaotic World experts to start the final battle in such a manner.

First, a team of experts to deal as much damage to the Three Emperors World as possible.

When the Three Emperors World experts came to their assistance, they crushed the Void Token, allowing the entire Eternal Chaotic World army to arrive instantly.

It was too sudden.

The Three Emperors World was caught unprepared.

At that special dark Void, Kaiser Blood sat had been sitting peacefully, waiting for the Imperial City’s good news.

But his face had changed.

“Final battle!”

“Crap, we’ve been played!” A grunt was made and Kaiser Blood disappeared from the Void.

The Imperial City was now in complete chaos.

The Eternal Chaotic World army had directly made their way towards the Three Emperors World Great Emperors and Almighties.

All of them were dying to kill.

At the vanguard, was Ancestor Tian Chen.

“Dragon Imprisoning Formation!” Ancestor Tian Chen let out a low roar, heard by a few behind him.

The people that heard him all took out an ancient black rock.

The black rock let out a mysterious aura.

Without hesitation, they threw the rocks at the Three Emperors World experts.

There were six rocks thrown out.

The rocks then exploded on the way out and formed a huge formation.

Six ancient formations were formed, covering six different Voids.

The six Voids covered much of the Great Emperors amongst the Three Emperors World experts.

“What is this?” The experts trapped in the formation were shocked and tried to break it down. But soon they realised that the formation was so strong it was practically indestructible.

Even when the Great Emperors combined their powers, they could not take it down.

They could only leave the formation when its energy had dissipated.

The Dragon Imprisoning Formation had been one of Sanctuary Alliance’s trump cards since the Ancient Era.

Once the formation was set, even Great Emperors could not break it.

The six Dragon Imprisoning Formations had now taken away the Three Emperors Worlds experts’ opportunity for escape.

“Heaven Piercing Arrows, standby!” Ancestor Tian Chen gave the order via transmission.

In the Void behind the Eternal Chaotic World army was a dozen Almighties. They did not charge into the battlefield like the others.

In front of them were four huge ballistae.
