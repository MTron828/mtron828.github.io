Chapter 2381: Fourth-Grade Craft Master

Soon, Jian Wushuang led by the black-armored guard came before Master Kun and the purple-robed middle-aged man.

“Jian Yi is pleased to meet Master Kun. I’ve heard of Master Kun’s name for a long time.” Jian Wushuang gave a slight bow and spoke politely.

In fact, he had only heard of Master Kun after he arrived at Qingxiao City.

“You’re so humble. Please have a seat.” Master Kun waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang sat down on a chair nearby.

Both Master Kun and the purple-robed middle-aged man had noticed Jian Wushuang’s true cultivation the moment he stepped into the hall.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was indeed outstanding, but his realm was too weak. He could disguise himself well before a Half-Step Divine Demon Realm but he fell short before a real full-fledged Divine Demon Realm, especially someone at a Second-Class Divine Demon Realm.

They could see clearly that Jian Wushuang indeed only possessed the cultivation level of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.

“Can a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm really kill a Half-Step Divine Demon Realm?” Both Master Kun and the middle-aged man were thinking in their heads.

“I’ve never heard of your name. Who is your master?” asked Master Kun.

“Neither do I belong to any school nor any master,” answered Jian Wushuang with a smile.

He then stood up and said, “Master Kun, truth to be told, I am here to ask for Master Kun’s help in crafting a piece of treasure.”

Master Kun exchanged looks with the purple-robed middle-aged man before asking, “What treasure is it?”

“It’s a Life Armor, Master Kun should know about it,” said Jian Wushuang.

Both Master Kun and the purple-robed middle-aged man were instantly moved when they heard of the Life Armor. It was a piece of treasure that represented a cultivator’s life and effort. It could also grow together with the cultivator, unleashing his unlimited potentials.

It required a large number of precious treasures and an exceptional craft master to make it.

Wusha Wilderness was just an unremarkable small place within the Ancient God Domain. It was an arduous task to craft a Life Armor here!

Therefore, Master Kun was startled after knowing that Jian Wushuang was going to craft a Life Armor.

“I see. Do you want to craft the Life Armor for yourself or...?” Master Kun was curious.

“I want it for myself,” Jian Wushuang replied straightforwardly.

He was telling the truth.

Among the five most powerful secret skills of the Seven Star Black Sect, the Nine Sparkle Star Armor was an extremely powerful secret skill.

Unfortunately, to cultivate this secret skill, one would need a Life Armor of his own. That was why Jian Wushuang was unable to get started with the secret skill until then.

Back then in Anjiu Commandery, it was almost impossible for him to craft his Life Armor due to the limited resources available.

After arriving at Narcissus Island, he took the opportunity to ask Elder Wujian if craft masters in Narcissus Island had the ability to craft a Life Armor, but he was again disappointed. He could only continue looking for other opportunities.

In Qingxiao City within Luogu Territory, he came to visit Master Kun right after hearing about his name.

“Do you know how hard it is to craft a Life Armor?” Master Kun looked at Jian Wushuang. “To craft a Life Armor, it does not only require a lot of rare and precious treasures. It also needs a cultivator’s strong essence and blood, and an exceptional craft master. These three are indispensable!”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. His expression was unperturbed. “That is exactly why I come to you, Master Kun today. I don’t know if you have the ability to craft a Life Armor. Do you?”

Master Kun frowned. He pondered for a moment before saying, “My little friend, truth to be told, you will need a minimum of a Fourth-Grade Craft Master to craft a Life Armor. Such a highly-skilled craft master might be common in the entire Ancient God Domain, however, I believe there are not more than three in Wusha Wilderness! Someone such as this is definitely a rare existence.”

There were a total of nine grades of craft master in the Ancient God Domain!

Yet a Fourth-Grade Craft Master was scarce in Wusha Wilderness.

“My friend, Jian Yi, there are indeed no more than three craft masters who have reached the Fourth-Grade in the entire Wusha Wilderness, but Master Kun who is standing in front of you now happens to be one of them.” said the purple-robed middle-aged man suddenly.

Master Kun also gave a confident smile.

“In that case, Master Kun, will you craft this Life Armor?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He was there to try his luck because he knew very well that it was an uphill task. Fortunately, he did not make the trip in vain.

“Although I have not been at the Fourth-Grade for long I am indeed a Fourth-Grade Craft Master. I have never tried making the Life Armor so there is a high possibility to fail on the very first try. If you would like me to make the Life Armor, I am afraid that you will need to prepare more materials for me to work with,” said Master Kun.

“I understand. What are the treasures needed for making a Life Armor?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Master Kun thought in silence momentarily before speaking slowly, “Four portions of Red Sun Secret Essences, five Red Blood Fruits, two drops of Purple Shimmer, 100 pieces of Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and finally 10,000 catties of Celestial Iron Ore! Collect all these materials and if your own essence and blood can meet the requirements, I promise to craft a Life Armor for you.”

Jian Wushuang was indifferent even after hearing what Master Kun said, but the purple-robed middle-aged man was completely astounded. He was shocked to hear the long list of materials listed down by Master Kun. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Purple Shimmer, Spectacular Beast’s scales are all extremely rare treasures in Wusha Wilderness, especially Purple Shimmer. There are perhaps only a total of five drops to be found in the entire Wusha Wilderness, yet three drops were needed to make the Life Armour!

As for Celestial Iron Ore, some ordinary sects will keep some in storage. It was nothing too precious but to gather ten thousand catties was unheard of!

Even if top sects such as the Great Compassionate Sect tried to collect it, they might need a long time to gather up to ten thousand catties.

“Is that all?” Jian Wushuang raised his head and glanced at Master Kun.

“These are the only items needed, but these items are not easy to find. Well, it is difficult to find them in Wusha Wilderness, my friend...” Master Kun had not finished his sentence when he was disrupted.

“This is my Message Token. I will send you all the materials within three years. I will also prepare a generous gift for you as a reward and I hope that I will have a Life Armor of my own.”

Jian Wushuang handed his Message Token to Master Kun. Then, he took a deep gaze at Master Kun before he turned and left.
