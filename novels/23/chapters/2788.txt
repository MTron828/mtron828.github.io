Chapter 2789: Jian Wushuang and the Eastern God

Boom

Jian wushuang’s four realms continued to suppress the experts of the four forces in an attempt to suppress their strength.

However, as soon as his realm swept out, the silver-haired old woman, Master Dongfang, smiled indifferently and said, “You’re not the only one who has realm techniques.”

As soon as she finished speaking, the master of the Dongfang family waved his hand slightly, and immediately, a vast green ocean swept out.

The Green Ocean was magnificent, and its waves surged wildly.

On top of the Green Ocean, there was a faint layer of blood-colored fog.

The Green Ocean was cast by a domain-type treasure in the hands of the Master of the Dongfang family, and the blood-colored fog was a secret skill cast by the Master of the Dongfang family.

The combination of the two, together with the fact that the master of the Dongfang family’s Dao world was not weak, swept out at this moment and directly collided with Jian Wushuang’s four-layered domain.

Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! ! !

The two different domains pressed against each other crazily, but it was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s domain was stronger and completely suppressed the master of the Dongfang family’s domain, however, the Dongfang family’s domain also took a lot of pressure on the experts of the four forces’Allied army.

The pressure on the experts of the four forces’Allied army was obviously not as great as before.

After the battle between the two camps.. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Most of the experts of crimson rock castle had not recovered to their peak condition, and some of them were seriously injured. Even with Yin Su’er’s backup plan and the Eight Great Divine Masters joining, their overall battle strength was still much weaker than that of the four forces’Allied army, the only good news was that Jian wushuang still had a certain advantage in his domain, which made their opponents’battle strength more or less suppressed.

Even if they could not defeat these elementary and advanced great divine masters, they could still hold on for a while.

As for the strongest battle strength, palace master Nan Wu was blocked by Yin Su’er and elder Tong, while the Tower Master of life and death fought against Yun Shan.

Although Yun Shan had been severely injured, he had recovered more than 80 percent of his strength after a period of time. He was strong enough to fight the life and death tower master head-on.

The Dongfang family master was the weakest among the four peak divine masters in the four forces’Allied army. She was fighting against the golden-armored corpse puppet controlled by Jian wushuang.

The golden-armored corpse puppet could also tie down the Dongfang family master with its advantage in a certain domain.

Among the four forces, there was only one peak great divine master left.

This peak great divine master was the sect master of the Divine Demon Sect, East God!

“Sword One!”

His cold voice echoed throughout the battlefield. East God’s eyes were cold, and he had locked his eyes on Jian wushuang the moment the battle began.

His opponent was Jian wushuang!

“Dong Shen, do you want to take revenge for the nine Great Divine Masters of Your Divine Demon Sect?”Jian wushuang stood in the void and looked at Dong Shen coldly.

“Die!”

Dong Shen did not waste any words. The violent aura on his body instantly surged up. A giant axe appeared in each of his hands. His body immediately transformed into an ancient ferocious beast. It was an enraged ancient ferocious beast that suddenly attacked.

Its speed was also extremely fast.

Jian wushuang stood there and felt that a violent and tyrannical aura had completely locked onto him.

The monstrous killing intent made Jian Wushuang’s eyes freeze.

He tightened the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand and directly rushed out.

In the center of the Void, Jian wushuang came into direct contact with his body.

“Destroy!”

Dong Shen shouted. The giant axe in his hand was so domineering that it seemed as if it could split the heaven and earth. One of the giant axes hacked down furiously.

“Swish!”A mighty axe shadow immediately slashed out.

This axe shadow was extremely overbearing and unreasonable. Its power was even more terrifying.

Jian wushuang held the blood mountain sword with both hands at the same time. Surging divine power surged out of his body, and his power reached its peak at this moment.

Buzz! !

A dazzling sword light that shook the heaven and earth suddenly rushed out.

The sword light was extremely huge and covered half of the sky. Its power was also astonishing.

In the blink of an eye, the mighty axe shadow came into direct contact with the huge and dazzling sword light.

Clang! !

With a loud sound, the violent divine power spread out crazily in all directions like a tide.

At the center of the collision, a huge divine power storm swept up.

Jian wushuang’s face darkened slightly. He could feel a huge force coming toward him, which made his divine body tremble crazily. He immediately retreated a great distance.

Before he could stop, the East God in front of him had already chased after him.

The two giant axes in the east god’s hands were already filled with surging divine power.

Jian wushuang narrowed his eyes and gently raised his hand.

The nine underworld blood divine swords immediately floated in front of him and formed a sword formation.

Buzz!

Under the cover of a large amount of reincarnation power, a giant black wood rushed toward the east God like a meteorite.

“Get lost!”

The east god shouted and casually slashed with the huge axe in his hand.

The terrifying power contained in the huge axe struck the huge black tree, which was immediately sent flying. In the middle of the attack, the huge black tree was still shaking crazily and was about to collapse.

This scene caused Jian Wushuang’s expression to change slightly.

“The power of the reincarnation sword formation is powerful. The World Sink of the Second Sword Formation I’m using now is purely about power. It’s a pity that the nine underworld blood divine swords that make up the sword formation are too weak. Otherwise, even if my divine power is weaker than his, I wouldn’t be nearly disintegrated by the axe,”Jian Wushuang thought.

He was still using the nine Netherblood divine swords to form the reincarnation sword formation.

It should be known that he had used the nine Netherblood divine swords when he first obtained the reincarnation sword formation when he was an Earth God master.

The Netherblood divine sword was only a standard magic weapon at the elementary divine treasure level. It was not bad when Jian wushuang only had the battle strength of an Earth God master and a divine God Master. However, now that he had reached the great god master level.., especially now that he was still fighting with a peak great divine master, the Netherblood divine sword was obviously not up to par.

Jian wushuang was sure that if he had formed the Samsara Sword Formation with nine standard magic weapons at the superior divine treasure level, then he should be able to fight head-on with the East God by relying on the second sword formation of the Samsara Sword Formation.

However, the East God laughed out loud and his words were full of ridicule when he casually hacked away Jian Wushuang’s Samsara Sword Formation with his axe.

“Haha, you are just a senior great divine master. How dare you compete with me in strength? You are courting death!”
