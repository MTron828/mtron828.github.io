Chapter 2582: The Inspector

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although the Interspatial Ring left by San Shouwang did not contain many Primordial Stones, the Divine Destructive Beast secret technique alone was very valuable. In addition, the Interspatial Ring also contained a large number of training resources which includes various elixirs, divine weapons, treasures, and secret techniques.

Those were exceptionally valuable things.

San Shouwang also possessed a Heavenly Treasure divine weapon!

That divine weapon was a pair of gloves that San Shouwang had been using.

Heavenly Treasures were extremely useful even for an Earth Ultimate God. Although San Shouwang’s pair of gloves was just an ordinary offensive divine weapon, its value nonetheless was estimated to be about one million Primordial Stones.

Overall, San Shouwang’s Interspatial Ring did not disappoint him too much.

After that, Jian Wushuang settled down in the Territorial Lord Mansion.

The Official Army had already informed the Crimson Stone Fort of Jian Wushuang beheading San Shouwang and Crimson Stone Fort would soon send an inspector.

On the other side, news of San Shouwang’s beheading and the new Territorial Lord who was about to take office had instantly spread across the entire Northern Darkstar Territory.

The many wildernesses under the Northern Darkstar Territory’s command had many sects and all of them were shocked for a brief moment after hearing the news and soon began preparing congratulatory gifts.

It had been more than ten thousand years since a new Territorial Lord took office. Those forces and sects—big or small—dared not take the new Territorial Lord lightly.

Three months passed by in a flash.

Three figures were standing in the void in front of the Territorial Lord Mansion. The person leading was a man dressed in a long and luxurious purple robe.

The purple-robed man had a menacing look with a hint of pride between his eyebrows as he looked down at the Territorial Lord Mansion below.

“Master, Jian Yi is in the Territorial Lord Mansion. Let’s go down and see him,” said a black armored old man next to him.

“No need.” The purple-robed man waved his hand and merely stood there as a huge gush of divine aura suddenly erupted from his body. He directly sent it downward onto the mansion below.

In the Territorial Lord Mansion, Jian Wushuang who was quietly meditating frowned and opened his eyes.

“Is this a Peak Earth Ultimate God’s divine aura? It must be from the inspector sent by Crimson Stone Fort. He uses his divine aura to oppress this area as soon as he arrives. Is he trying to flex his powers?” Jian Wushuang muttered before moving his body and soon appeared in the void above.

As soon as he arrived in the void, he saw the purple-robed man who was exuding the divine aura.

“Are you the inspector?” Jian Wushuang acted humbly.

Jian Wushuang had to give a face to the inspector sent by Crimson Stone Fort after all.

“Yes, I am. Are you Jian Yi?” The purple-robed man wore a cold face as his eyes locked on Jian Wushuang. “I heard you’re just a Peak Ultimate God?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Hmph, what’s the name of the previous Territorial Lord again? San Shouwang? He’s really a useless bum. How could he possibly die in the hands of a Peak Ultimate God? How embarrassing!” The purple-robed man gave a contemptuous look.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He was not annoyed and humbly replied, “Inspector, let’s enter the mansion and talk.”

The purple-robed man nodded slightly and immediately headed toward the Territorial Lord Mansion.

In the magnificent-looking palace, Jian Wushuang did not take his usual elevated seat. Instead, he sat face to face with the purple-robed man.

The two people who came with the purple-robed man were also seated nearby as maids in Territorial Lord Mansion brought tea with Xiao Tiexin standing obediently next to Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Yi, I won’t beat around the bush. I came here under the order of Crimson Stone Fort to choose the right person and take over as the new Territorial Lord. The Official Army recommended you, but you’re just a Peak Ultimate God.” The purple-robed man looked cold.

“There are a total of three hundred eighty-one stellar regions under the Danyang Holy Realm’s command and there are of course three hundred eighty-one Territorial Lords. All of these Territorial Lords were experts from the Earth Ultimate God Realm and above be it those who are in the office or the ones who have. Only with an Earth Ultimate God in place managing the stellar region can the stellar region be peaceful.

“There has never been a precedent for a Peak Ultimate God to become a Territorial Lord in the Danyang Holy Realm. It’ll be difficult to convince the public if you become the new Territorial Lord. I believe the Northern Darkstar Territory will be completely in a mess not long after this.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He knew that Crimson Stone Fort sent an inspector to verify whether he had the strength to become a Territorial Lord.

However, the inspector in front of him did not say anything to verify his strength after talking so much. The inspector merely insisted that Jian Wushuang’s realm was not qualified to become a Territorial Lord which was a deliberate act to embarrass him.

“Master Inspector, one’s cultivation realm doesn’t mean everything. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“One’s cultivation realm of course cannot represent everything as you must have the power of an Earth Ultimate God since you can kill San Shouwang. However, a Peak Ultimate God is still inferior to a real Earth Ultimate God when standing side by side in terms of aura though both might have similar combat strength and that intimidating aura is exactly what a Territorial Lord needs.

“It’s quite difficult for you to be the Territorial Lord with your current cultivation realm with that being said. However, it’s not impossible as you may have to pay a little price for it,” said the purple-robe man slowly with his eyes squinted.

Jian Wushuang raised his brows. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He understood the message’s meaning.

The purple-robed man was trying to make things difficult for him, so he could reap some benefits from Jian Wushuang.

“How much is the price to pay?” Jian Wushuang asked calmly.

“Not much. Three million Primordial Stones and I’ll take care of everything after I go back. As long as there are no major riots or revolts within the Northern Darkstar Territory, I can guarantee you will be the despot here without any worries.” The purple-robed man cracked an evil smile.

“Three million Primordial Stones?” Jian Wushuang kept a straight face but was sneering in his heart.

Three million Primordial Stones was a high price to pay. The inspector was not only greedy but also asking way too much.

Perhaps the inspector knew Jian Wushuang had just killed San Shouwang, thought that Jian Wushuang might have gotten a great deal of wealth from San Shouwang, and was trying to make some easy money.

Any other person might have given away under the inspector’s pressure were it someone else. One might have just given three million Primordial Stones away when comparing the benefit one could gain after becoming the Territorial Lord. However, Jian Wushuang was not a pushover.

“Master Inspector, is it really that hard for me to become a Territorial Lord? Do I really have to pay three million Primordial Stones?” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the purple-robed man.
