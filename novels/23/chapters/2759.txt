Chapter 2760: Outstanding Combat Power

“He’s Fiery Cloud Demon Master!”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes as his eyes were locked on the fiery red-haired old man who looked like a fireball.

Jian Wushuang knew Fiery Cloud Demon Master because he was among the list of experts Jian Wushuang wished to send a recruitment invitation with the Huangji Golden Pill.

There were three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods in the list of experts given by Strange Old Snake, one of whom was Strange Old Tong.

Of the two remaining, one had disappeared for many years without a trace whereas the other one was Fiery Cloud Demon Master, who had also suddenly disappeared many years ago. No one knew his whereabouts but from what Jian Wushuang could see at that instance, Fiery Cloud Demon Master had obviously joined Divine Demon Sect.

“Fiery Cloud Demon Master is also an exceptionally powerful High-level Grand Ultimate God. Even if he fights one-on-one with Strange Old Tong, it doesn’t seem possible for Strange Old Tong Lao to defeat him in a short time. With him coming into the battlefield alongside two Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods, we’re probably not in an optimistic situation,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Indeed, the tide on the battlefield had completely been reversed after Fiery Cloud Demon Master and his two members joined the battlefield.

Sword Alliance used to be suppressing the eight Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods, but when Divine Demon Sect presented eleven Grand Ultimate Gods at once with Fiery Cloud Demon Master among them, Sword Alliance fell from the advantage position and faced severe disadvantage.

“Alliance Master Su Han, show what you’ve got quickly, otherwise we will lose any time.” Lan Junzhu shouted sternly.

Among the Sword Alliance Grand Ultimate Gods, Lan Junzhu was the only Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Hence, she was facing greater pressure.

Lan Junzhu naturally felt helpless as she was facing three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods alone. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang acknowledged the situation with a nod and immediately waved his hand.

Three figures appeared instantly in the void.

Those three figures were lifeless. Two of the figures were in copper-colored tone and the last one had a silver-colored surface.

They were the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets that Jian Wushuang had in control.

“They are...”

When those three corpse puppets appeared, they attracted a lot of attention from the surroundings.

Soon, someone recognized the three corpse puppets.

“They’re corpse puppets. Judging from their aura, they’re very powerful corpse puppets.”

“Alliance Master Su Han has control over these powerful corpse puppets?”

“No wonder he dares to challenge Divine Demon Sect. As expected, Alliance Master Su Han has a certain amount of support.”

Those Sword Alliance Grand Ultimate Gods felt a sense of relief.

“Go on.”

Jian Wushuang pointed at a distance. Then, the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and the two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets immediately discharged powerful aura and dashed into the battlefield.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet had combat power equivalent to a top-notch High-level Grand Ultimate God whereas the Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets ranked the same as an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God.

The situation on the battlefield was flipped around once again after three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods joined the battle.

“Is this your support?”

The Divine Demon Sect Master, Dong Shen, looked across the battlefield at Jian Wushuang.

“One Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets, Strange Old Tong, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin who had just broken through to reach the level of a High-level Grand Ultimate God, Strange Old Snake, Mr An Ying and finally, Lan Junzhu, your Sword Alliance is indeed no less than any top forces in terms of combat power. No wonder you dare to go against us, the Divine Demon Sect.”

“Su Han, I regret that I had not wiped the Sword Alliance out when it had just emerged as a first-rated force and before it was firmly entrenched in power. Sword Alliance was vulnerable then.” Dong Shen’s eyes were cold.

“You’re right. If Divine Demon Sect or any of the top forces had attacked Sword Alliance then, we would not be able to resist at all. Unfortunately, you were all too aloof and tried to maintain the status quo of Danyang Continent. None of you were interested in going into a war and that gave me enough time to build the Sword Alliance. That being said, Divine Demon Sect has missed the best opportunity to destroy Sword Alliance,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I missed the best opportunity indeed, so this time around, I must completely destroy your Sword Alliance by all means, so that the equilibrium in Danyang Continent can be restored.” Dong Shen’s voice was cold.

“Su Han, I admit that your Sword Alliance has risen very fast, and you have gathered such a powerful lineup of Grand Ultimate Gods in such a short period of time. You certainly have wonderful methods, but it is a pity that you have underestimated us, the Divine Demon Sect.”

“The reason why Divine Demon Sect has become one of the top forces in Danyang Continent and it remained strong for so many years was not only because of our profound background and the many powerful Grand Ultimate Gods we have. The most important thing was that the Divine Demon Sect has the strongest combat power in Danyang Holy Domain!”

Dong Shen’s eyes were gleaming when he said that.

“Dong Shen, are you referring to yourself as the strongest combat power?” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

Dong Shen nodded slightly, admitting that he was the one.

There was no other Undying Saint from the Danyang Holy Domain since the passing of Crimson Stone Saint.

That made the Peak Grand Ultimate God possessing the strongest combat power in Danyang Holy Domain!

In addition, there were only a handful of Peak Grand Ultimate Gods in Danyang Holy Domain. Among them, Nan Wu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower and Donggang Clan, the four top forces had one each. Dong Shen was the one from Divine Demon Sect.

Under the leadership of a Peak Grand Ultimate God, Divine Demon Sect was qualified to be called one of the top forces.

That explained why Dong Shen was not too bothered even though the Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods were at an absolute disadvantage in the confrontation with Sword Alliance Grand Ultimate Gods.

He had the strongest combat power and he had yet to participate in the battle.

However, he would very soon join the battle.

“Su Han, you haven’t fought against a Peak Grand Ultimate God so you’d never know how terrible a Peak Grand Ultimate God is. Do you think it’s enough to be able to compete against and overpowered the Divine Demon Sect Primary-level and High-level Grand Ultimate Gods? That, I tell you, is ridiculous.” Dong Shen sneered.

While he was speaking, the astounding breath of divine power that far surpassed everyone else in his body was woken up like an aroused dragon.

On the battlefield, the Grand Ultimate Gods from the two camps shivered when they sensed the breath of divine power.

The Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods were overjoyed.

They knew that their Sect Master, Dong Shen, would take the shot himself.

A Peak Grand Ultimate God who also had the highest combat power in the Danyang Holy Domain was about to take the shot personally...

The faces of the Sword Alliance Grand Ultimate Gods were a bit ugly.

They had no chance against Dong Shen and they could only rely on whether Jian Wushuang had prepared for the counterattack.

What worried them was that if Jian Wushuang had enough to resist Dong Shen.
