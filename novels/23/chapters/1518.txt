Boom! Boom!

Two shocking noises could be heard. The two headless soldiers had already appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. They then extended their longspears. Its power was impressive.

“Hmph, you’re not the only one who knows consciousness attacks,” Jian Wushuang gave a cold “hmph”. A huge amount of Soul Power burst forth and a giant golden Divine Ape rose up.

Similarly, the golden Divine Ape carried a longsword. With a shrill roar, it moved toward the two headless soldiers.

“Piss off!”

The longsword swept past the area rashly. As the stroke contained a shocking amount of strength, it pushed back the two headless soldiers at the same time.

After that, the golden Divine Ape took one step and plunged toward Xin Zhu.

“If two headless soldiers are unable to stop you, how about three?”

Xin Zhu’s eyes turned cold and gloomy. After his speech, another headless soldier appeared in the void in front of him. In addition to the two headless soldiers previously, there were a total of three headless soldiers. Rumble! The three headless soldiers gave off amazing power and surrounded Jian Wushuang’s golden Divine Ape. They then attacked at the same time and gave Jian Wushuang more pressure.

“This Xin Zhu is really powerful!”

Jian Wushuang could not help but exclaim.

It should be known that every headless soldier had the fighting capabilities of a Real God. Hence, three headless soldiers were equivalent to three Real Gods teaming up, which put Jian Wushuang under a lot of pressure.

At that moment…

“Haha, this place is really lively.”

Laughter could be heard and a silver-armored young man could be seen speeding over from a distance away.

Around this battlefield, there were a few Universe Gods present. However, those Universe Gods were observing from a distance and they did not dare to go over. Afterall, the ones fighting were the monsters in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list. Without sufficient power, they wouldn’t dare to participate in such a fight.

And at that very moment, the silver-armored young man plunged over fearlessly. Naturally, he had absolute confidence in his own abilities.

“It’s Universe God Liu Ying!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes could not help but narrow.

“Liu Ying,” Xin Zhu also looked toward him.

Universe God Liu Ying was ranked seventh in the Universe God ranking list, which was just after Jian Wushuang and Xin Zhu.

By including Duan Lingfeng and Zi Dongwang, who were by the side, out of the Ten Monsters who were in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list, five of them were present!

“Liu Ying, you must be here for the White Blaze Fruit, right?” Xin Zhu spoke.

“Of course,” Universe God Liu Ying laughed.

“Since that’s the case, you and I should team up and kill this Jian Wushuang. As for the nine White Blaze Fruits that he has, we shall split them among us after killing him. Deal?” Xin Zhu said.

“All right,” Universe God Liu Ying nodded his head without hesitation.

At that moment, everyone in the cave knew that Jian Wushuang alone possessed nine White Blaze Fruits. Hence, Universe God Liu Yang showed himself since his objective was also Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s do it. Kill!” Xin Zhu was filled with murderous intent.

Universe God Liu Yang also transformed into a silver, fluttering light and charged into the battlefield like lightning.

“Another one. Hmph!” Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold. However, he was not fearful in the slightest bit. With a shift of his body, eighteen shadows appeared immediately.

His body also became abnormal.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, the experts on the higher-end of the Vientiane Tower believed that your martial art motion was number one among the Universe Gods. However, I, Liu Ying, am the first person to be dissatisfied with that. Today, I wish to see exactly how impressive your martial art motion is,” Universe God Liu Yang gave a loud laugh. With a change of the silver, fluttering light that he had transformed into, the light transformed into many layers and countless silver, fragmentary shadows appeared in the universe. These shadows were also extremely strange.

Martial art motion was what Universe God Liu Yang was the most proficient in.

Before Jian Wushuang appeared, he was recognized as the number one among the Universe Gods in terms of martial art motion.

At that moment, he had come across Jian Wushuang. Firstly, he wished to get the White Blaze Fruits from Jian Wushuang. Secondly, he wished to have a showdown with Jian Wushuang.

“Bring it on!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with harsh light. His body movements bypassed the small gaps between the three headless soldiers easily and he headed toward the layers of silver light.

He attacked with his Blood Mountain Sword abruptly and the golden Divine Ape which shrouded his body also launched an attack.

As for Universe God Liu Ying, his hands were each carrying a big, silver hammer and he attacked with lightning speed.

Bump! Bump! Bump! Bump!

Intense sounds of thunder could be heard continuously. Initially, the sounds of collision had come from one part of the void. However, in the next moment, it came from tens of miles away from the ground and this opened up a big hole in the ground. After that, the sound came from a mountain and the mountain had also split open.

It was too fast!

Their movement speed was too fast and their martial art motion was also extremely strange.

Among the Universe Gods who were observing the battle from a distance, most of them revealed a shocked expression. They were totally unable to see Jian Wushuang and Universe God Liu Ying’s figure clearly. What they could see was the strange golden, fragmentary shadow left behind by the golden Divine Ape that shrouded Jian Wushuang’s body.

However, as number six on the Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu could see everything clearly.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang and Universe God Liu Ying had just clashed with one another head-on once. All of a sudden, they heard explosive sounds near them. The three big, headless soldiers had already appeared beside Jian Wushuang and the three longspears headed toward him at the same time.

“Hmph, although your headless soldiers are powerful, their bodies are too big and they are too clumsy. Therefore, they are unable to touch me,” Jian Wushuang laughed disdainfully. With a strange movement of his body, he circled around the three headless soldiers easily. The longspears of the three headless soldiers were totally unable to touch Jian Wushuang’s clothes.

Jian Wushuang was standing together with Universe God Liu Ying like before.

“Jian Wushuang, you dare to underestimate me?”

Xin Zhu’s eyes were filled with flames of fury. After that, the three headless soldiers swung their arms with great strength.

The longspears on their hands were thrown out at once and they aimed at Jian Wushuang.

The speed of throwing was a lot faster than the moving speed of the three headless soldiers. While Jian Wushuang was still fighting with Universe God Liu Ying, the three longspears were thrown with lightning speed.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. His body then writhed strangely and he avoided the paths of the three spears.

However, the moment he avoided the longspears, Universe God Liu Ying found an opening.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, eat my hammer attack!”

Universe God Liu Ying was laughing loudly. At the same time, both his hands held a big hammer.

“Meteor Heavenly Hammer!”

Boom!

A silver thunderbolt descended with lightning speed abruptly.

Faced with the hammer attack, Jian Wushuang was unable to dodge. Moreover, he had also failed to use his Sword Principles in time to block the attack. Hence, he could only use the Blood Mountain Sword to block.

Bam!

With a loud noise, Jian Wushuang’s body was sent flying to the ground like a meteorite. In the end, he crashed into the ground, creating a big hole.

However, not long after the big hole appeared, rustle! An enormous amount of crimson flames burst forth abruptly. The crimson flames had an astonishing temperature which burnt the ground to ashes. At the core of the crimson flames, a figure appeared. It was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang just then was like an emperor of the sea of fire.
