Chapter 3574: Unbelievable

To activate the Universe Origin of Sword Principle and take the first step into the Universe Origin of Sword Principle!

In just 80,000 years, this rate of improvement was too frightening.

“The key is that he is only an Immortal Saint?”

Even though this consciousness was knowledgeable, at this moment, a huge wave was stirred up in his heart.

It took a deep breath before it shouted again, “Third brother, wake up!”

“Fourth brother, what’s wrong now?” The second consciousness that had previously awakened and conversed with this consciousness also woke up.

“Hehe, it’s still for that little fellow trapped in the eighteen ultimate formation.” The first consciousness laughed.

“I already said that that little fellow was destined to die from the moment he stepped into the eighteen ultimate formation. What’s there to say? It’s a waste of time.” The second consciousness said with some dissatisfaction.

“Doomed to die? I don’t think so,” the first consciousness said with a demonic charm. “Third brother, take a good look at the little guy in the 18-ultimate formation and see what level he has reached.”

“Oh?” The second consciousness could not help but be surprised.

Although he had woken up, he did not immediately grasp the situation of this special space-time. Now that he heard the first consciousness’s words, he subconsciously looked at the high platform, immediately, he saw the scene on the high platform.

He saw Jian Wushuang walking on the high platform. There were still six human-shaped sculptures in front of him. When these six human-shaped sculptures joined hands, they were extremely powerful. Previously, even if Jian Wushuang tried his best, he was still completely suppressed by these six human-shaped sculptures.

But now...Jian Wushuang looked relaxed and content. He casually drew his sword and did not display any extraordinary sword skills, but he could easily block the sword skills of the six human-shaped sculptures, each of his casual moves triggered the Universe Origin of Sword Principle, making his swordsmanship even more terrifying.

“This, this is?”

After seeing the scene on the high platform, the second consciousness was stunned, but then became excited. “The Universe Origin of Sword Principle, yes, it’s the Universe Origin of Sword Principle!”

“Haha, yes, it’s the Universe Origin of Sword Principle. He has already taken the first step of the Universe Origin of Sword Principle. Now you dare to say that he can’t break through the eighteen ultimate formation and is doomed to die?” The first consciousness laughed.

“How is this possible?” The second consciousness was still filled with shock. “A mere Immortal Saint can actually take such a step in Sword Dao?

“Moreover, when he first came to this space-time 80,000 years ago, he didn’t come into contact with this level at all. He even took the wrong step in Sword Dao. However, in a short span of 80,000 years, he has already taken this step?”

“I also find it unbelievable.” The first consciousness said, “Even though I spent most of my time sleeping, I still pay attention to this little guy. I can be sure that when he entered this space-time, he didn’t even know what the Sword Dao universe origin was, and he was trapped here the entire time. There was no one to guide him. He relied purely on his own trial and error, and in just a short 80,000 years, he actually reached this step...”

“Tsk, tsk. I know that there are some incredible geniuses in this vast universe. All of them are incomparably heaven-defying. For example, the two geniuses who passed through the eighteen absolute formations were extremely heaven-defying. However, one of them was a Principles Master, while the other was a Ruler. In terms of talent, they probably can’t compare to that little fellow trapped within the eighteen absolute formations.”

“Indeed, he did not receive any guidance. He only relied on his own exploration.” The second consciousness sighed.

If Jian Wushuang had reached this stage under the guidance of an expert, they would still be able to accept it.

After all, the most important step to step into the origin of the sword universe was to first come into contact with the origin of the sword universe.

If there was no guidance, ordinary people would not know what the origin of the sword universe was, so how could they come into contact with it?

However, Jian Wushuang really did not have anyone to guide him. He just relied on his own trial and error, relying on his comprehension on the way to battle with those human-shaped sculptures to find his sword principle’s inadequacies, then he decisively collapsed the sword world and began to re-cultivate sword principle. This ability was indeed incredible.

“The first step in his dao of the sword to enter the origin of the sword universe means that his understanding of the Dao of the sword is already higher than that of an ordinary Ruler. His understanding of the Dao of the sword is so high that even if he hasn’t fused four laws to become a Ruler, he can still easily create a level seven absolute art, or even an advanced level seven absolute art. Once he creates an advanced level seven absolute art, the eighteen absolute formations won’t be able to stop him,” the first consciousness said.

“Well, with such a high understanding of sword principle, it is indeed easy to create a level seven absolute art.” The second consciousness nodded.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang had already taken the first step into the origin of the sword universe, the two consciousnesses understood that it was difficult for Jian Wushuang to break through the eighteen ultimate formations.

Now they were both looking forward to Jian Wushuang creating a level seven advanced absolute art and then breaking through the eighteen ultimate formations.

For this reason, they even stopped sleeping temporarily and stayed awake, keeping an eye on Jian Wushuang.

On the high platform, Jian Wushuang had already defeated the six human-shaped sculptures.

It was normal. After reaching the fourth level of sword principle, each of his sword skills was extremely powerful. Even if he did not use any extraordinary sword skills, he could easily defeat the six human-shaped sculptures, once he used his strongest technique, he could easily crush the six sculptures.

However, after he defeated the six sculptures, the remaining 12 sculptures around the platform woke up at the same time. Together with the previous six sculptures, a total of 18 sculptures attacked at the same time.

Although the absolute arts performed by the 18 human-shaped sculptures were only at the pinnacle of the six realm, the swordsmanship performed by the 18 human-shaped sculptures was as powerful as the previous six human-shaped sculptures, it had completely reached the peak of the seventh level elementary absolute arts. Jian Wushuang could not withstand such power, so he was defeated and retreated to the center of the platform again.

However, Jian Wushuang was not at all disappointed this time. On the contrary, he was full of confidence.

“Fortunately, the swordsmanship power of these 18 human-shaped sculptures is only at the level of the seventh-level absolute skill. At most, it is at the peak of the seventh-level elementary skill. Although I can’t fight against this level of absolute skill now, I have reached the fourth level of sword principle. It should not be difficult for me to create a seventh-level absolute skill now. As long as I can create the same level of the seventh-level elementary skill, I can fight these 18 human-shaped sculptures head-on!”

“And once I’ve created a seventh-level art, I can easily break out of this array!”
