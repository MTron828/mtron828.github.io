4373 The Blood Curse

Run!!!

Supreme Lie Chen’s heart instantly went into a frenzy, and he turned around to flee!

However…

The entire universe seemed to have frozen over. Under the full-force attack of the Ruler Blood Wave, a massive suction force was drawn from the palm of his hand, sending Ruler Lie Chen flying toward the palm!

!!

The palm finally pressed down.

Endless celestial light and Starlight surged, and the palm patterns were so thin that they were almost visible. Under this palm, all sounds were silent.

Bang!

Supreme Lie Chen poured out all of his divine power to resist the palm.

At this moment, his heart was filled with regret and even more so, he felt extremely aggrieved.

If he had known that Jian Wushuang had such a great killing move, he would not have dared to chase after Jian Wushuang even if he had ten times the courage.

Ka-chak.

However, it was useless to say anything at this time. This palm was the Blood Wave Supreme’s full-powered attack. If Supreme Lie Chen had been a top-tier Supreme, he might have been able to resist it. However, he was only an advanced Supreme, so how could he resist the Blood Wave Supreme’s full-powered attack?

His feet were the first to be obliterated inch by inch by the tremendous power of the palm. Soon after, his arms began to explode.

“Jian Wushuang, even if I die, I won’t let you have an easy time!”

Supreme Lie Chen suddenly turned to look at Jian Wushuang with a resentful expression. He shouted with all his strength, “Supreme Divine Art, Blood Curse!”

Bang!

All of a sudden, Supreme Lie Chen’s eyes exploded, and two streams of blood flowed out of his eyes. They twisted and condensed, and finally hung above Jian Wushuang’s head, forming a huge Scarlet word, ‘kill’!

With the word ‘kill’ in front of him, all of Jian Wushuang’s concealment techniques would be exposed. He would even be like a piece of rotten meat that would attract all the experts above the Supreme realm in the surrounding ten thousand miles of starry sky!

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly turned gloomy and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Hahahaha! Jian Wushuang, I’d like to see how many times the Ruler Blood Wave’s full-power attack can protect you!”

Boom~!

“Hahahaha…” Supreme Lie Chen’s divine body was obliterated by Supreme Blood Wave’s palm, and he laughed maniacally.

Supreme Lie Chen had died!

After killing Supreme Lie Chen, the power of that palm also gradually dissipated. In the end, it disappeared and returned to nothingness.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, his black hair flying in the wind, and his expression was uncertain.

He didn’t feel the slightest bit of joy at the death of Supreme Lie Chen.

The huge ‘kill’ word hanging above his head was like a bright light in the dark night, extremely conspicuous, and he had nowhere to hide.

He tried to use the power of the great Dao to erase the word ‘kill’, and also tried to see if the Antelope mask could cover it, but it was useless. All his methods were useless.

“This is going to be troublesome.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered continuously. He understood that the word ‘kill’ would cause a stir among the Supremes in the entire universe and they would come to kill him.

Just as Jian Wushuang was deep in thought, a burst of crazy laughter suddenly came from nearby.

Hhahaha, Jian Wushuang, I’m finally out!”

In the distance, the Eternal Night Kingdom continued to shatter and finally exploded. Although Supreme Darknorth was in a sorry state, his face was full of joy as he rushed out of the Eternal Night Kingdom with a loud laugh!

“Supreme Green River, Supreme Lie Chen, how are you?”

“Come, let’s join forces and take down Jian Wushuang. We’ll split the treasure!”

“Eh…”

“Supreme Green River? Supreme Lie Chen?”

In the next moment, the smile on Supreme Darknorth’s face froze. It was as if someone had grabbed his throat, and his face turned red.

The surrounding void was in chaos, and countless cracks appeared in the void. The entire backtrack was destroyed.

Where were the shadows of Supreme verdant River and Supreme blazing Phoenix under the starry sky?

Only Jian Wushuang, who was dressed in black and had black hair, slowly turned his head and looked at him coldly.

Supreme Darknorth was momentarily stunned, but he still mustered his courage and asked, “Little thief Jian Wushuang, let me ask you. Where are Supreme Green River and Supreme Lie Chen?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him with a strange expression. He didn’t expect that Supreme Darknorth, who was the weakest among the three great Supremes that had come to kill him, would live the longest.

Immediately, he faintly replied, “You guess.”

For some reason, a premonition welled up in his heart upon hearing this, and he hurriedly spread out his divine power to sense his surroundings.

In the next moment, Supreme Darknorth’s expression changed drastically, and he sucked in a breath of cold air. His lips trembled as he said, “They…they’re dead?”

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to answer, he took a step forward and divine power surged in his body.

Just as Jian Wushuang thought that Supreme Darknorth was going to take revenge for the deaths of Supreme Green River and Supreme Lie Chen, he clenched the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand tightly.

“Fiend! He’s a fiend!”

“Run!” Supreme Darknorth roared as he turned around and fled. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s sight.

“Huh?”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but be stunned. Then, a look of astonishment flashed across his face.

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang didn’t plan to chase after him. This Supreme Darknorth was only an elementary Supreme, so he couldn’t pose any threat to him. At most, he could spread the news about him. Now that he had the word ‘kill’ above his head, it didn’t make much difference to him whether the news spread or not.

...

“What I need to do now is to quickly find a place to recover my divine power and truly open the ancient bronze cauldron! Only then will I have the power to protect myself in the upcoming battle!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and he quickly made a decision.

Then, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and put Leng Rushuang into the heaven suppressing monument. He then quickly left in a direction.

…

What Jian Wushuang didn’t know was that not long after he left, two divine lights appeared in the backtrack land like meteors.

The divine light dissipated, revealing the figures of two Supreme martial artists.

“This aura is the Tarot Divine Sword! Jian Wushuang was here before!”

One of the Supreme martial artists, who was wearing a bamboo hat and carrying a knife at his waist, said in a deep voice.

“That’s right. It’s the aura of the Tarot Divine Sword. It also contains the divine power fluctuations of Supreme Lie Chen and Supreme Green River. It seems like the two of them were killed by Jian Wushuang!”

A hunchbacked old woman with pimples all over her face and an extremely ugly appearance said in a hoarse voice.

“Go! Jian Wushuang shouldn’t have gone far, let’s chase!”

...

The eyes of the Supreme-being in the bamboo hat flickered as he looked around at the void. Finally, his eyes fixed in the direction where Jian Wushuang had left, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

“Look, there’s a blood tunnel here. Jian Wushuang must have been hit by Lie Chen’s Blood Curse!”

The two of them looked at each other. Then, they turned into two divine lights and chased after Jian Wushuang at an extremely fast speed!

Very quickly, the backtrack fell into silence.

Not long after, several Supreme Masters arrived one after another. After thinking for a while, they all smiled greedily and chased after Jian Wushuang!
