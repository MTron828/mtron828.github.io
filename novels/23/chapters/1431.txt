Chapter 1432: Task Assigned!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Hall Master Yuan gave Jian Wushuang a hundred years to prepare himself.

In the past hundred years, besides the first ten years that Jian Wushuang used to cultivate Xuan Mie Golden Body, he spent the rest of the time on comprehending the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.

On Sword Star, swoosh! A figure suddenly descended.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The thick, deep voice was heard in every corner of Sword Star. The maids and servants on Sword Star immediately grew frightened while Jian Wushuang who was cultivating in the secret room was frightened too.

“Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang immediately appeared before Hall Master Yuan.

“How did your preparation go over the past hundred years?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Not bad,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“I heard that you bought the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation left behind by Real God Jue He at a great price from the auction in Star Pavilion. It seems that you are planning to comprehend Reincarnation Doctrine in the future?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded as he thought to himself, Hall Master Yuan had yet to find out that he was already a beginner in Reincarnation Doctrine.

“Reincarnation Doctrine falls under the Supreme Four Doctrines. Compared to the other Nine Heaven God Doctrines, they are much more difficult. As you have already opted for that doctrine, you will have to work harder,” Hall Master Yuan exhorted.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“Alright, I shall cut the bullshit. The purpose of my visit is to assign you the ultimate disciple task. I mentioned to you a hundred years ago that you should prepare yourself!” Hall Master Yuan suddenly grew solemn, “The ultimate disciple task is assigned to you by myself personally. It is divided into three parts.”

“Three parts?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“Three parts of the task, and every task comes with a different reward. Among the tasks, one of the rewards is one million Chaos Gems,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes beamed with joy.

If it was during Star Pavilion, he wouldn’t mind much about Chaos Gems. He probably wouldn’t even be bothered if he had heard of the one million Chaos Gem then.

But, after the auction in Star Pavilion he had earnt a debt of tens of millions in Star Pavilion. Completing the first part of the task happened to make him able to clear his debt.

“This is the first part of the task. It’s in the token. When you complete the first part of the task, send me a message and I will tell you the second part of the task,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“The ultimate disciple task is no trivial matter. You have to be careful in your journey. Go ahead,” Hall Master Yuan waved.

“Yes.”

Jian Wushuang immediately departed.

After he left Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang immediately read the details of the first part of the task.

“Mm, boundless void?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

Outside Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, the boundless void was where bandits ran wild and massacres took place in extreme madness.

It was the nightmare of many Universe Gods.

Many experts from every region and Holy Kingdom of Eternal Chaotic World died in the boundless void before they managed to even step foot in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

When Jian Wushuang had come to Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries previously, he took the risk in the boundless void too. Now, Jian Wushuang’s first part of the task took place in the boundless void.

The context of the task was for him to kill eleven bandits on the run in the boundless void!

The eleven bandits were from Star land. They had committed great offenses in Star land and they couldn’t return. Hence, they had decided to run amok in the boundless void.

The bandits were all Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, which was extremely powerful.

After Jian Wushuang knew the context of the task, he immediately left Purple Moon Sanctuaries through the wormhole on the island and came to the boundless void.

Two years later.

“Mister, that’s Ancient Moon Island, where Universe Zhu Xin stays,” a person in a black robe stood politely next to Jian Wushuang.

“Mm.”

Jian Wushuang nodded while his gaze looked towards the end. There was a floating island. The surface area of the island wasn’t huge, but there was a fierce aura that the island carried.

Jian Wushuang needed to kill his first target, Universe God Zhu Xin. He was on the island then.

“Luckily, Lineage of Star found the location of the eleven people long ago. Otherwise, if I were to have to search through the boundless void to find the eleven people it would be like finding a needle in a haystack,” Jian Wushuang joked.

“Wait here,” Jian Wushuang glared at the person in a black robe next to him.

“Mister, it is more than just Universe God Zhu Xin alone who is a bandit on Ancient Moon Island. There are a total of hundreds of Universe Gods. Among them, there are five Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. If you were to barge in like this, it would…” the person in a black robe creased his eyebrows, but didn’t finish his sentence.

“You want to say that I have overrated my abilities?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The person in a black robe stiffened and revealed a humble expression.

“Just you watch,” Jian Wushuang smiled and plunged towards Ancient Moon Island.

When he got closer to Ancient Moon Island, his Soul Power spread and covered the entire island. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He could see everything on Ancient Moon Island clearly.

“There’s a total of three hundred and sixty-six Universe God on the island. Among them, there are five Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, thirty-one Universe Gods at the rank of advanced and beginner. The remaining ones are Universe Gods in the First and Second Heaven,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Actually, the information was given in the description of the task that Hall Master Yuan gave. He was only confirming it.

According to the information that Hall Master Yuan had provided him with, the five Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were merely ordinary Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. None of them possessed extraordinary fighting powers.

“I can wipe off such bandit force alone. There’s no need for beating around the bush.”

Jian Wushuang smirked, then he appeared in the void above Ancient Moon Island. The moment he appeared, he formed a force using an enormous amount of divine aura to suppress the entire island.

There was a sudden commotion on Ancient Moon Island.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were many figures that plunged out of the buildings on the island and appeared in the void above. There were a few hundred of them and they were led by five people.

“How dare you behave atrociously on my Ancient Moon Island?”

A loud, raging voice reverberated through the void. The one who spoke was a middle-aged man with a beard and tan skin. The middle-aged man had a soaring, fierce aura and carried a huge ax on his back. The person was the strongest among the first Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven on Ancient Moon Island.

At that moment, the bearded middle-aged man and the Universe Gods around him fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang.

These people’s gazes were filled with murderous intention.
