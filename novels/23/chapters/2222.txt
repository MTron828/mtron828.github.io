Chapter 2223 Thunder-like Suppression

Hong!That punch split the earth.

A large hole that permeated the entire city came out of thin air.

That horrifying, earth-shattering blow was heading towards Xie Yu.

The sheer power alone took everyone around aback.

Xie Yu’s face darkened and he threw a punch out consciously, trying to resist.

But as the fists collided head-on... there was a bang. Then there was the sound of crackling of bones.

Xie Yu’s entire arm had been blasted away from the sheer power and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.

“This level of power, Chaotic Divine Demon!”

Xie Yu was terrified.

“Impossible! Are there no restrictions placed upon this earth? Everyone can only reach Chaotic Realm powers!”

“Sword Emperor, how can he do that? Impossible!”

Xie Yu was being torn apart.

He did not know that the restrictions were only placed upon typical cultivators, and did not affect Inverse Cultivators.

When Emperor Bai had given his all during the final fight against the Three Emperors World, along with the Secret Skills of Star Palace amplifying his powers tenfold, he could have reached Chaotic Divine Demon levels.

But Jian Wushuang’s fighting power now was stronger than Emperor Bai’s.

Emperor Bai needed the Secret Skills of Star Palace to reach Chaotic Divine Demon levels.

But for Jian Wushuang, with the ultimate phase of the Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step mastered, Bloodline Power, and Immemorial Celestial Body, he could hit Chaotic Divine Demon levels even without Secret Skills of Star Palace.

Jian Wushuang could crush Xie Yu with pure power alone.

That left Xie Yu no room to even struggle against Jian Wushuang.

“Run!” Xie Yu finally got his act together, or perhaps Jian Wushuang’s power had frightened him.

Grabbing his dagger with his bare hands, then releasing Chaotic Divine Demon powers in a single punch?

How could he block that when he could only perform pinnacle Chaotic Realm powers himself?

He had to run.

“Don’t think you can escape,” Jian Wushuang glanced coldly at Xie Yu, and leapt over casually.

The leap seemed casual, but it contained the Power of Spacetime, making him endlessly faster than the speed at which Xie Yu could escape. Immediately he caught up with Xie Yu.

“He has Rules of Order?” Xie Yu glared.

But Jian Wushuang had already pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword, and directly threw it up in the air, turning it into a large mountain.

The bottom of the mountain had streaks of mysterious lines, forming a large black hole in an attempt to suck in Xie Yu.

“Suppressing me? Dream on!” Xie Yu was enraged and started to struggle in a frenzy.

“Struggle? What’s the use of that?”

Jian Wushuang could only sneer.

The suppressive abilities of the Blood Mountain Sword increased in proportion with Jian Wushuang’s own abilities.

To activate the suppression, Divine Power had to be used.

With Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power being fully released to Chaotic Divine Demon levels, how could the Chaotic Realm Xie Yu possibly have blocked his suppression!

“No! No!”

Xie Yu could only scream as his body approached the black hole.

“Brothers! Save me!”

Xie Yu screamed as he transmitted his call for help to his brothers.

After that, he was fully absorbed by the black hole.

The large mountain reverted back to the Blood Mountain Sword once again and landed in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Jian Wushuang remained indifferent as if he had simply suppressed a normal man, instead of an Ancient Era expert.

His heart did not flutter at all.

Indeed, an Ancient Era that could only demonstrate the Third Stage Great Emperor powers no longer excited him anymore.

He could suppress or kill them with a flip of his hand.

But it looked completely different in front of all the cultivators.

“This... this...” Emperor God Bai Xing of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church was dumbfounded, his eyes were almost falling out of their sockets.

Sir God Mo Qiu and the rest were equally shocked.

Perhaps the other cultivators could not feel much, for they do not know much about Xie Yu’s background anyway.

But Emperor God Bai Xing and the other Sir Gods knew that Xie Yu was an Ancient Era expert!

An Ancient Era expert had been so easily suppressed?

“How could that happen?” Emperor God Bai Xing was on the verge of collapse.

But he came to his senses before long.

“Run!” Emperor God Bai Xing led the escape. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The other Sir Gods from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church were not slow either, and all started running away.

If even Lord Xie Yu could be so easily suppressed, none of them would stand a chance against Jian Wushuang.

Emperor God Bai Xing was only thinking of returning to Real Martial Arts Divine Church and getting Xie Yu’s brothers to appear.

He knew that the brothers were much stronger – perhaps they stood a chance together against Jian Wushuang.

As Emperor God Bai Xing and the rest were escaping, Jian Wushuang was still indifferent, not moving an inch.

It was as if he was about to let them go.

But not long after, a mysterious attack quietly struck the five of them.

A trace of terror flashed across the eyes of the five of them.

The next moment, five corpses were plunging straight for the ground.

“Dead, the leader of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and his four Almighties, all dead!”

“How are they dead? The Sword Emperor did not move at all!”

“If I’m not wrong, he used a Soul Attack!”

The surrounding cultivators were in awe, looking at Jian Wushuang in respect.

Jian Wushuang remained indifferent.

Soul Attack.... indeed that was what he did.
