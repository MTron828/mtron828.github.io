Chapter 2744: One More Trick Up the Sleeves

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hum! Hum!

The sky-high flames once again came surging out with their flame waves red as blood while it crazily burnt everything around it. The Star Armor Domain that filled the surrounding Heaven and Earth was affected by its bright red domain with its suppression power also greatly weakened.

Jian Wushuang slightly narrowed his eyes as the expression on his face turned solemn.

On the other hand, Saber Master’s face was completely distorted.

“Su Han, you should be proud of yourself for forcing me into such a state despite being a mere Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.” Saber Master’s eyes were extremely red as though he had lost his wits. In addition, not only had he recovered his aura to its peak condition, he even seemed to be slightly stronger compared to his peak.

‘It looks like the pill is something that can increase his strength within a short time with serious side effects. His strength has increased tremendously within a short period with this pill. This is really troublesome.’ Jian Wushuang slightly frowned.

He originally thought Devilish Wind King had already forced Saber Master into desperation when he previously controlled the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. He chose to take action and killed Devilish Wind King because he felt that Saber Master would have previously used any measures he had left.

He never expected Saber Master to have one more trick hidden up his sleeves and only use it at that moment.

“Die!!”

Boom!!

Saber Master took action.

Heaven and Earth were shaken by his move.

The momentum was a whole level stronger compared to his peak state when he defeated Hong Chen and Long Xianzi.

The endless bright red flames expanded crazily as a wave of overpowering aura directly suppressed Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang dared not act carelessly. The huge black wood formed by nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords slightly trembled and attacked Saber Master with a horrifying power.

“Move!” Saber Master casually waved his saber as the crimson battle saber Holy Treasure in his hands looked as though it was covered in a layer of blood.

A bloody saber-light was directly sent outward and landed on the huge black wood.

Clank!

A loud noise could be heard as the huge black wood was sent flying with the slash and the entire sword formation started trembling crazily as though it was going to be dismembered.

‘Such strength is comparable to even ordinary Peak Grand Ultimate Gods.’ Jian Wushuang was horrified.

Although he was horrified, Jian Wushuang was not frightened at all.

Jian Wushuang could be seen quickly retreating and did not face Saber Master head-on before concurrently waving his hand and a wave of flowing light was sent outward before immediately integrating with the surrounding black void during his retreat.

Heaven and Earth instantaneously changed.

An extremely beautiful world from a scroll painting appeared out of nowhere in the surrounding dark void.

The beautiful world in the scroll painting looked extremely real. In addition to the mountains and waters, there were also nine great continents within it.

“This is?” Saber Master frowned as he looked at his surroundings with a bad feeling arousing from the bottom of his heart.

“Thousand Treasures Grand World, Space-time World!” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice had already sounded at that moment.

Rumble~

Changes had occurred to the surrounding Heaven and Earth.

Jian Wushuang’s domains and Saber Master’s sky-covering flames in the original vast dark void had changed into a Space-time World within the blink of an eye.

The Space-time World had a huge number of space-time cracks and space-time storms. In addition, there was an uncountable number of Space-time Blades in the Space-time World.

Those Space-time Blades also had terrifying killing power.

The entire world was filled with the endless power of Space-time Law.

It was a Space-time World filled with unlimited Space-time Energy with Jian Wushuang standing in the middle as though he was that world’s ruler!!

“Saber Master, welcome to my world.” Jian Wushuang smiled as his laughter reverberated in every corner of the world.

Thousand Treasures Grand World. It was the second time Jian Wushuang had activated the Stately Painting’s power after regaining it.

“Your world?” Saber Master’s facial expression changed drastically.

Although he was unsure when the void change happened, the simple act of changing Heaven and Earth alone was enough to terrify him.

“Let’s fight.” Jian Wushuang did not say anything more and once again moved his body.

His speed had been further increased. The Space-time World was filled with all sorts of Space-time Laws and his originally amazing speed had been greatly improved at that moment.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang had already appeared in front of Saber Master as though he teleported.

In addition, a cold sword-light was already attacking Saber Master’s throat like a lightning strike.

‘So fast!!’ Saber Master was shocked but immediately reacted with Endless flames rising as it burned and its high temperature almost turned Jian Wushuang into ashes.

Waves after waves of crimson saber-lights attacked Jian Wushuang from every direction.

Jian Wushuang once again disappeared before Saber Master with another move and appeared beside him.

‘D*mn it, his speed has increased by so much?’ Saber Master’s eyes turned blood red with a crazed look as he could sense that Jian Wushuang’s current speed was so much faster than previous. He would not have any methods left under such horrendous speed if Jian Wushuang did not want to fight him head-on and only pester him.

“B*stard, fight me face-to-face if you dare.” Saber Master yelled out loudly and repeatedly waved the battle saber fiercely while yearning to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang’s figure traveled in an extremely ghostly way and did not meet him head-on. Instead, he relied on his speed and attacked Saber Master at a weird angle from his sides.

Although Saber Master was strong, he could only continuously think of ways to withstand Jian Wushuang’s repeated attacks and seemed to be in an extremely embarrassing situation.

‘Fight him face on? What a joke.’ Jian Wushuang scoffed inwardly.

Saber Master’s full strength had been increased due to the scarlet pill. His current combat power was almost comparable to a true Peak Grand Ultimate God, yet he asked Jian Wushuang to fight him head-on under such circumstances? Jian Wushuang would be extremely dumb if he did.

‘Although the pill greatly increases his power, the side effects must be great too. In addition, the pill will only take effect for a short time. I only need to rely on my absolute speed and pester him in this Space-time World without allowing him the chance to escape. It’ll be extremely easy if I want to kill him after his pill’s effect wears off.’ Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he already had an exact plan in his heart.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Under the support of the Space-time World, his figure kept flashing and the speed he released at that moment was so much faster compared to previously.

Saber Master could do nothing to him as he was unable to catch up to Jian Wushuang’s speed.

Although Saber Master kept roaring angrily during the process and tried to fight Jian Wushuang head-on, Jian Wushuang ignored him.

A quarter of an hour had passed in the blink of an eye.
