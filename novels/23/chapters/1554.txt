Chapter 1555: A Great Change

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At one of the passages within the Red Stone Prison. Jian Wushuang had an icy-cold expression. As he held the Blood Mountain Sword on his right hand, he walked forward slowly and his eyes remained vigilant regarding his surroundings at all times.

He had already attempted to break open the Red Stone Prison moments ago. However, he discovered that he did not have the ability to do so as he could not even break open the stone wall which was beside him.

Without any choice, he could only follow the passage in front of him and continue walking slowly.

“Although this prison is sturdy, it was still created by an Eternal Real God. With Real God Long Qing’s abilities, he should be able to break out in a short while,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

At that moment, at the front of the passage, two big shadows appeared in front of him.

“Battle puppets?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. “Void Real God-level battle puppets.”

The two battle puppets were each holding a saber on their hands. Their icy-cold, unfeeling eyes had also locked onto Jian Wushuang firmly.

In the next moment, the two big shadows moved at the same time!

Boom! Boom!

Two frightening power burst forth abruptly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and he unleashed his martial art motion instantly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Back then, when he was travelling in Wu Bei’s cave, his martial art motion had been recognized as the number one among the Universe Gods. Moreover, at that time, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was only at the Beginner’s level.

After leaving Wu Bei’s cave, a total of one thousand eight hundred years had passed. During the one thousand eight hundred years, with the help of the Real God Hall, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had improved greatly. At that very moment, it had also achieved the standard necessary to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace. Moreover, the secret skill Flowing Light Phantom was also controlled by the Power of Spacetime.

The higher the comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine, the more frightening his martial art motion was.

At that very moment, when Jian Wushuang had unleashed his martial art motion again, it was a lot stronger than back then when he had unleashed it in Wu Bei’s cave.

Swish! Swish!

Among the eighteen shadows, when the two of them were near the two battle puppets, both of them did an action mimicking a sword swing.

The two battle puppets also took out their sabers instantly and swung them with their great power. At once, the swings became shrill saber light which struck Jian Wushuang’s body. However, it was obvious that what they had struck was merely a phantom.

As for Jian Wushuang, his real body unleashed a random stroke which was like an arc of light and he struck the necks of the two battle puppets easily.

Two heads were then sent flying immediately.

Without their heads, the two battle puppets collapsed at once.

“Clap! Clap!”

Clapping sounds could be heard. When Jian Wushuang raised his head to take a look, he saw that His Highness Mu Song and the fat middle-aged were walking toward him slowly.

“As expected of the top genius who is able to rank third on the Universe God ranking list.?These two Demon God Puppets of mine actually possessed the fighting capabilities of Void Real Gods. However, they were destroyed by you instantly,” His Highness Mu Song giggled. However, he was still a bit amazed.

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the two of them, especially the fat middle-aged man. His expression could not help but change, but he heaved a sigh of relief after that, “It’s still all right. This Eternal Real God has been seriously injured by Real God Long Qing just now. Hence, he should not be able to unleash much of his fighting capabilities.”

Jian Wushuang was still extremely fearful of the Eternal Real Gods.

As for His Highness Mu Song, Jian Wushuang could tell that he was only at the level of a Void God. Hence, he was not too afraid.

“Jian Wushuang, today, I really wish to see exactly how strong a top genius like you who is on the Universe God ranking list is,” His Highness Mu Song laughed coldly. Without saying many unnecessary words, a green sickle appeared in his hands. The edge of the green sickle was extremely small but sharp. Under the illumination of the red stones around the area, the green sickle emitted an icy-cold dark red luster.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands tightly.

“Haha, let’s fight!”

His Highness Mu Song laughed coldly and with a movement of his feet, the green sickle changed into a green glittering light and proceeded to attack with lightning speed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Many green saber lights seemed to descend at the same time and they shrouded Jian Wushuang instantly.

Jian Wushuang released the Divine Power in his hands and also activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor completely. After that, the Blood Mountain Sword attacked straight away.

“Clang!”

Even though it was only the first clash, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, “What strength. He has probably achieved the peak of a Void Real God!”

There were both strong and weak Void Real Gods. The weak ones were the very normal Void Real Gods and normally, the top thirty of the Universe God ranking list could compete with them. As for the top ten on the Universe God ranking list, they could kill the Void Real Gods.

However, there were also Void Real Gods who had comprehended a small bit of the Power of Heaven Way. With that, their abilities were no longer normal. As for the top of the Void Real Gods… Normally, their comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way would allow them to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace. One such example was the Fiery King who was a Peak Void Real God.

However, for His Highness Mu Song who was in front of him, although his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way was not very high, due to some secret skills as well as the treasures that he possessed, he could also unleash the fighting capabilities of a Peak Void Real God.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, why have you been on the defensive ever since we started fighting? Come on, show me your moves. Or could it be that you have been pushed back by me so much that you are unable to counter-attack?” His Highness Mu Song laughed loudly and swung the green sickle in his hands continuously. Every swing held a great amount of power and pushed Jian Wushuang back to the point that he had to retreat continuously.

However, although Jian Wushuang was retreating continuously, his eyes remained icy-cold and his expression did not show any fear.

“Although this person possesses the fighting capabilities of a Peak Void Real God, he does not have much experience in close-quarters combat,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted slightly. At the next moment, his body moved and he unleashed the secret skill Flowing Light Phantom as well as his unusual martial art motion at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s ghost-like body avoided the saber lights that His Highness Mu Song unleashed easily and he appeared in front of His Highness Mu Song.

“Ten Thousand Shadows.”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A huge number of sword shadows appeared at the same time.

Under the influence of Jian Wushuang’s Power of Spacetime, every sword shadow was unbelievably fast.

“What?” His Highness Mu Song’s expression changed slightly and he swung his green sickle immediately to block. His body was also forced to retreat.

Jian Wushuang stood in his position and a small bit of disdain flashed past his eyes.

“Seems like I have overestimated him. Although he indeed has the fighting capabilities of a Peak Void Real God, his close quarter combat abilities are too weak. While he has the abilities, he is unable to unleash them completely,” Jian Wushuang sneered, “I shall stop wasting my time on him and kill him directly!”

Jian Wushuang glowed with murderous intent. In a split second, an enormous amount of Soul Power burst forth and a giant golden Divine Ape covered his body.

His Divine Power and Soul Power had combined beautifully. With that, Jian Wushuang’s abilities had achieved their peak.

Next, Jian Wushuang was about to launch his attack.

However, all of a sudden… an unusual change occurred!

Boom!

Jian Wushuang felt as if he had been struck by a streak of lightning from a clear sky. His body paused at his position and his heart was beating madly.

“This, this is…”

“Of all times, why must it be now?”

“No, no!”

Jian Wushuang roared within his mind and his expression also became unusually ugly.

He had never expected this to happen. At the critical moment where he was in the Red Stone Prison which was very close to Leng Ruxue… his Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven actually descended without any warning!!
