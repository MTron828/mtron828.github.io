Chapter 5585: Death Comes

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Fortunately, due to severe injuries, Hu Qing remained in a deep slumber, relieving him of any concerns. Otherwise, it would have been truly difficult for him to face the situation.

Even now, even if he had truly defeated Jiang Shang, he wouldn’t personally take action, opting instead to leave it to Zhen Ling.

He wasn’t going to bear that responsibility!

Let Zhen Ling take care of the killing, or find someone else to do it. At worst, push the responsibility onto someone else.

This way, Hu Qing wouldn’t leave the Qishen Temple, and there would be no resentment towards him.

Initially, Hu Qing was just a young novice monk, and now he had become a supreme-peak powerhouse.

Time!

How fast it passes by!

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but marvel.

As for the battle between the two, he didn’t pay much attention. Jiang Shang’s aura was weakening, and Moluo could win at any moment.

If he intervened now, he could directly defeat Jiang Shang. However, he had some reservations deep down.

Clang!

The coffin behind Jiang Shang began to shake, and wisps of black flames emerged from it. The moment this aura appeared, Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, and his expression changed drastically.

“Step back!” Unable to stop it in time, he angrily shouted.

He initially thought that Hu Qing was sleeping inside, but once the aura leaked out, he realized it wasn’t Hu Qing. Instead, it was a force diametrically opposed to the Life power he possessed.

Life!

Death!

Or, it could be described as a force of annihilation.

It was also a manifestation of the power of All Things.

People are dualistic, let alone All Things.

Where there’s life force, there’s also the force of death.

That is the dark side of All Things.

Never in his wildest dreams did Jian Wushuang expect Jiang Shang to possess such ability. Zhen Ling hadn’t informed him that Jiang Shang wielded this power.

Not only him, even Zhen Ling himself hadn’t anticipated it.

Just because One Thought Universe had sealed off this place, even though Zhen Ling controlled the Four Great Secret Realms, he hadn’t detected the emergence of the power of Death.

As soon as that force leaked out, Moluo sensed a tremendous threat. Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s warning, he hastily retreated, but there was still a trace of the power of Death contaminating his body.

Ah!!!

Moluo, tainted by the force of Death, had a drastic change in expression. His pupils contracted, his physical body began to burn with widespread Death, cracks appeared in his divine body, and even his Origin Source was withering.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang discovered it in time. From a distance, a burst of Life power erupted, directly forcing out the annihilating power within Moluo.

Although it was only a trace of Death power, it consumed 20 percent of Jian Wushuang’s Life power. Though it could be replenished quickly, on the battlefield, everything changed in an instant. Even a momentary delay in replenishing could lead to downfall.

“Pay attention to that power. I will coordinate with you to take her down as soon as possible!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

He couldn’t afford to drag this on any longer!

That power was too terrifying.

Although Life power and Annihilating power restrained each other, the power within the coffin was clearly at a much higher level than his.

He was currently just a Dao Lord, and the Life power he manipulated was not pure enough.

At least, he hadn’t reached the level of creating Special Life Forms out of thin air.

Special Life Forms were extraordinary beings born from the transformation of the power of All Things accumulated in some cosmic mysteries into Life power.

Jian Wushuang mastered Life power, so naturally, he could create Special Life Forms. However, the Life power he manipulated was still too weak.

Once he broke through to become an Emperor, he would probably be able to create Special Life Forms.

Hehe…

The eerie laughter sent shivers down one’s spine!Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“No wonder you’re so calm; turns out you still have a trump card!” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Jiang Shang’s expression was somehow uneasy.

She turned her head to look at the coffin behind her, furrowing her brows.

She had figured out the power from just now and angrily shouted, “I want you dead!”

Jiang Shang erupted completely. Her hair fluttered, and her aura instantly reached an unprecedented level. Jian Wushuang’s One Thought Universe was torn apart.

The tremendous backlash force directly injured Jian Wushuang. A mouthful of blood sprayed from his mouth, and his body swelled before violently contracting.

The divine body also plummeted!

The Life power within continuously nourished him, allowing him to recover gradually.

On the other side, it was evident that Jiang Shang’s earlier words were not directed at them.

She forcefully pulled open the swaying coffin, releasing all the power of Death inside.

Rolling thick mist dispersed.

Without the supplement from One Thought Universe, both Jian Wushuang and Moluo saw a significant decline in their strength, and their movements slowed considerably. Fortunately, Moluo reacted quickly, pulling him backward.

“What exactly is inside?” Jian Wushuang turned to Jiang Shang, who had escaped the thick fog with them, and asked.

Jiang Shang’s expression was embarrassed and anxious as she gritted her teeth and replied, “It’s all because of the pressure you put on us!”

It turned out that when she left with her master Hu Qing, they encountered a mysterious powerhouse willing to help her quickly restore Hu Qing’s Origin Source. The mysterious figure gave her a black seed and the coffin with it.

Initially skeptical, she had no other choice. She couldn’t let her master remain in a deep sleep forever!

After testing it herself, she dared to put Hu Qing inside.

Unexpectedly, that seed contained the power of Death.

The force within the coffin was even more peculiar, continuously nurturing the power of Death.

Jian Wushuang cursed in his heart upon understanding the reason.

He thought Hu Qing wasn’t inside, went around, only to find him lying inside.

A strand of Life power-infused Thought power entered the thick fog, but there was no sign of Hu Qing’s presence.

“No, he couldn’t have perished!” Jian Wushuang was completely dumbfounded.

If Hu Qing really perished, he would be the first to kill Jiang Shang.

“He was my master, and I would save him. I don’t need your hypocritical presence here!” Jiang Shang exclaimed angrily.

In her eyes, she couldn’t understand why the Qishen Temple had to lay hands on her and her master. Now, with Jian Wushuang chasing them, she couldn’t help but suspect if he had manipulated things behind the scenes.

Jian Wushuang’s expression gradually darkened, and in a trance, he recalled a scene from the past.

The masters of the young samanera, one by one, fell like fallen children being brought to the shore, all perishing, including Hu Qing who sacrificed himself for Jian Wushuang.

After finally stepping onto the path of cultivation, though it had been somewhat smooth, it was not easy.

Now, it was very likely that all of it might come to an end. How could Jian Wushuang’s heart not tremble?

Turning to look at Jiang Shang, Jian Wushuang no longer concealed anything. His voice turned cold as he said, “Do you know, Hu Qing sacrificed the nurturing of the Qishen Temple for you, sacrificed his own life, all for you!”

It’s not worth it!

A tremor ran through the sea of Jian Wushuang’s Origin Source, and a scorching power rose.

It was the great killing tribulations, the karmic calamity!

Karma concretized!

This represented the culmination of the power of Karma.

Karma increased again. If it weren’t for him sacrificing Jiang Shang’s brother, Hu Qing wouldn’t have encountered Jiang Shang, and today wouldn’t have happened.

Both of them had a significant connection to his karma.

Making the calamity within him even more formidable.

Hearing his words, Jiang Shang was momentarily stunned, then she seemed to have trouble believing. Her pupils dilated as she questioned, “Could it be that you don’t want to kill me?”
