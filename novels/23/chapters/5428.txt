Chapter 5427 ¬†Dao Merge

Wuliang Buddha, even at the tier 4 level, could oppress and beat a tier 5 Emperor. Once Hu Qing successfully merged the Dao, he would be an Ultimate Emperor at tier 5. He would be capable of beating even a tier 6 Emperor. He would at least be comparable to a peak-level tier 6.

From a distance, Gui Ling and others descended. Seeing that the Crown Prince of the Mo Luo Nation was still alive, Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief.

"There must be great opportunities here. Follow me and charge in!"

Simple!

Brutal!

They just went straight for it! ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

However, before they could charge in, Situ Nan and Tongtian Buddha blocked their way.

Tongtian Buddha sneered and shouted, "Who dares to take a step forward!"

Situ Nan's aura was also rising. Although Shang was no longer there, the strength of these people should not be underestimated. It was not easy for Gui Ling to kill his way in.

When necessary, Zhen Wuyang and Chishui would also make their move.

They were all Inheritors.

"Everyone, isn't this a bit too overbearing? For the sake of a little guy, you want to give up such an opportunity?"

Gui Ling had not yet discovered the person among them related to the Inheritors.

He thought these Inheritors were crazy. They were leaving opportunities untouched and watching others merge the Dao.

Situ Nan coldly replied, "Island Lord Gui Ling, this person is the Inheritor of the Grave God Mountain, and he's only a Dao Lord. If anyone dares to disrupt his opportunity, Grave God Mountain, Elder Palace, and the Temple will not let you go. You better think it over."

Gui Ling, standing still, had an unsightly expression, frowning.

This was not just a scare!

He was genuinely a bit afraid. He hadn't expected these people to bring a Dao Lord in with them. Giving such a huge opportunity to a Dao Lord was quite unreasonable.

Beside him were numerous disciples and onlookers. The Turtle Spirit Island Lord, undeterred by the potential loss of face, calmly said, "Since he's a Dao Lord, so be it. What's so great about a Dao Lord's inheritance? I want to see if he can break through!"

"Virtuous!" Tongtian Buddha sighed in relief.

Hu Qing was in a state of union with the Dao. This was a monumental event, especially for a Dao Lord.

Union with the Dao meant transcending life and even space itself. Not to mention engaging in combat; even a surge of energy could potentially sever the heavenly path.

So, if one could avoid battle, it was best to do so. If Hu Qing's union with the Dao were delayed, no one would be able to bear the consequences.

This was the Ultimate Dao Lord among the Dao Lords on Grave God Mountain, ranking in the top three.

Moreover, he had cultivated the Ultimate Dao to perfection.

It's important to note that reaching perfection in the Ultimate Dao was a tremendous challenge. Once successful, it surpassed those who had not achieved perfection by more than just a single level.

On Grave God Mountain, most Ultimate Dao Lords were around the seventh level, with a few at the eighth level. Only a handful had achieved perfection in the ninth level.

Ultimate Dao Lords who could unite with the Dao in a perfect manner numbered less than a dozen.

These were the most elite talents on Grave God Mountain, even more critical than Emperors like them.

Although some were dissatisfied, no one dared to voice their objections.

After the Turtle Spirit Island Lord stepped back, he felt a bit uncomfortable. Although he hadn't suffered many losses this time, he hadn't obtained a single treasure.

His gaze shifted to Jian Wushuang.

Currently, among the three factions, the ones who suffered the most significant losses were the Kui Organization and the Elder Palace.

Shang's avatar alone was comparable to all of them combined.

As for the Kui, they not only lost a peak-level Emperor and a top-level tier 6, but more importantly, Bai Junwang was gone.

Initially, Jian Wushuang thought that once Bai Junwang recovered to his peak, he would sweep through everything, and all the treasures and opportunities here would be his. Now, not only had that plan fallen through, but he had also become the weakest party.

There was only one top-level tier 6 Emperor left by his side, and the other peak-level tier 5 Emperors were practically useless.

On the other hand, in the Elder Palace, after losing Shang's avatar, there were still three tier 6 Emperors, each at the peak-level.

Even those who weren't at the peak-level could easily defeat the half-hearted tier 6 Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms.

Situ Nan was in a league of his own; no one could match him. Zhen Wuyang, Chishui, and Tongtian Buddha had strengths comparable to peak-level tier 6 Emperors.

With this exchange, the Elder Palace boasted six formidable powers, leaving aside some tier 5 Emperors.

As for Gui Ling, there were seven or eight tier 6 Emperors, including three at the peak-level. The remaining ones were top-level tier 6 Emperors. The tier 5 Emperors on Jian Wushuang's side were not as impressive.

However, those details were inconsequential now.

Gui Ling had set his sights on him, and this time, things might not be so easily resolved.

"Island Lord!" Jian Wushuang showed great respect.

Now he had no choice but to lower his head! With no one protecting him, he could fall at any moment.

The Island Lord's expression remained unchanged as he solemnly said, "Speak, what exactly happened just now."

Situ Nan and Zhen Wuyang also turned their attention, clearly wanting to know what had transpired moments ago.

Concerning the Universe Master, there was no time to inquire while escaping just now. Now that everything had come to a halt and there was no imminent danger, they naturally wanted to discuss it.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment. He knew he had to say something; otherwise, he wouldn't easily pass through this situation.

"Elders, about the recent events, I am indeed not clear. We proceeded according to the plan, and the incident happened suddenly. I am not well-informed, and unfortunately, it was our people who died!" Jian Wushuang spoke sincerely; the ones who had died were indeed their own people.

If it had been others, he might have been held by the tier 6 Emperors as if he were a toy.

Situ Nan's face darkened, and he spoke coldly, "What plan, what organization, speak one by one!"

Possibly accustomed to the ways of the Heavenly Realm, he began with a series of inquiries.

Jian Wushuang turned to glance at Elder Zhi Shan, passing the blame onto him.

Appearing to be just a tier 5 Emperor, Jian Wushuang couldn't reveal too much. He could only disclose his recent exploration with friends and leave the rest for this old man to handle.

Onlookers could see the peculiar status of Jian Wushuang, despite his relatively ordinary strength.

"I am the Lord of Purple Bamboo Forest in the Western Sea. This time, I explored this place with a few friends. Unfortunately, this incident occurred. The fallen person, insatiable in greed, was overwhelmed and lost consciousness. As for the rest, I do not know."

Elder Zhi Shan's words were vague, not as clear as Jian Wushuang's.

Clearly, it was not going to pass as a plausible explanation.

Jian Wushuang pondered the situation on the field.

The avatar of the Ultimate Emperor probably had fallen, so the remaining combat power needed to be distributed. The Elder Palace and the Inheritors were still superior.

He needed to win over the Turtle Spirit Island Lord now.

Not exactly winning over, but rather seeking refuge.

Jian Wushuang secretly transmitted, "Island Lord, at the moment, the Elder Palace and the Inheritors are the strongest on the field. We can't afford to fight with them; otherwise, we'll be giving them an advantage. The opportunities ahead have already been seized by them. If we don't do something, we won't have a chance to intervene in the opportunities that follow!"

"Young man, are you trying to use me again?" The Turtle Spirit Island Lord wasn't foolish.

He was right. Teaming up was indeed suitable at the moment, but Jian Wushuang, a top-level tier 6 Emperor, didn't offer much leverage.

One top-level tier 6 Emperor, it didn't matter much.
