Chapter 2213 Fighting Power Skyrocketed

Jian Wushuang spent a thousand years inside the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower sparring against other experts.Jian Wushuang had lost count of how many battles he had fought.

However, he knew his sword skills were improving at a tremendous rate.

No other opportunities could help him improve at such a great rate.

This was because he was fighting against an expert of a completely new level. It was as though these experts had opened a new door to Sword Doctrine.

There had been a leap in his sword skills and his understanding of Sword Doctrine compared to before.

Jian Wushuang felt that he could kill his old self with one simple slash.

That was how much he had improved.

In the dark space, a Space Tunnel appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Looks like I took exactly one thousand years to defeat sixteen opponents.”

Jian Wushuang smiled as he followed this space tunnel out of the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower.

“Emperor Thirteen,” Jian Wushuang greeted as he bowed slightly.

With the great improvement in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine, Jian Wushuang felt completely different when he looked at Emperor Thirteen once again.

Back then, he had not had a clue how powerful Emperor Thirteen was. He only knew he was extremely powerful.

Now, he felt that Emperor Thirteen himself was a unique divine sword.

The sword essence that he radiated made Jian Wushuang’s heart throb.

“Even though my understanding of the Sword Doctrine has improved greatly, I am nothing compared to Emperor Thirteen,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He knew where he stood.

He knew he still needed a lot of practice as his sword skills now were still not good enough for him to go against the Blood Emperor.

When Emperor Thirteen fought Blood Emperor, he was under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. He could only use a small portion of his sword skills.

However, this little portion of his sword skills was already far superior to what Jian Wushuang had right now.

How incredible were his sword skills when Emperor Thirteen was in his prime?

Jian Wushuang could not imagine that.

“How many opponents did you defeat during the one thousand years you were inside?” Emperor Thirteen asked.

While Jian Wushuang had been sparring opponents within the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower, Emperor Thirteen had been meditating and did not take note of what happened within the tower.

“I defeated sixteen,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sixteen?” Emperor Thirteen nodded his head in approval.

He expected that Jian Wushuang could defeat around thirteen or fourteen opponents. Jian Wushuang had gone beyond his expectations and defeated sixteen.

The opponents within the trail tower would become increasingly stronger, and it would be increasingly more difficult to defeat them.

“From the moment you defeat the first opponent, you are considered an ametuer in the Sword Doctrine. If you can defeat the opponents, you will have reached the initial success. When you defeat twenty, you will have reached the Profound Realm. You still have a lot to work on before you reach Profound Realm as you have only managed to defeat sixteen opponents,” Emperor Thirteen said.

“I’ve only reached initial success?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had thought that the improvement he had over the one thousand years was incredible enough.

He had not expected that he had only reached initial success in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine.

“You will only reach the profound realm after defeating twenty opponents. What if you defeat thirty, fifty or even a hundred opponents?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You are still in the profound realm after defeating thirty opponents. You will only reach complete satisfactory for the Sword Doctrine after defeating fifty opponents. As for a hundred opponents... You have exceeded the complete satisfactory for the Sword Doctrine and finally reach the Sword Doctrine Realm. You can then be called an expert in sword doctrine,” Emperor Thirteen said.

“Sword Doctrine Realm?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

From what Emperor Thirteen had said, there were realms that differentiated people of different levels of mastery of the Sword Doctrine.

Jian Wushuang still had a lot of room to improve before he could reach the profound realm.

Even if someone surpassed being complete satisfactory for sword doctrine and reached the Sword Doctrine Realm, they would be considered an expert in sword doctrine, but not a top tier one.

“Sword Doctrine is really broad and profound.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Of course. As for you now, you need to continuously accumulate experience to elevate your mastery of Sword Doctrine. Even the Sword Doctrine Realm is a far fetched concept for you in this era. However, initial success in sword doctrine is already enough for you to completely dominate everyone in this era,” Emperor Thirteen said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up in excitement.

Jian Wushuang’s mastery of sword doctrine was much better than it had been before.

Aside from the experts from the ancient past, there would be no one within the Eternal Chaotic World with a greater understanding of sword doctrine.

With his sword skill, the amount of divine power he had from the ultimate phase of the seventh step inverse cultivation and his understanding of Rules of Order, his fighting power was far greater than what it had been!

He was so much more powerful that he himself had no idea how strong he actually was.

However, he knew for sure that he could definitely beat Emperor Bai in a batte.

“Lord Emperor Thirteen, thank you!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jian Wushuang thanked him gratefully.

Both the Heaven Suppressing Monument or the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower had helped him greatly as his fighting power had skyrocketed.

Both of these treasures belonged to Emperor Thirteen.

Both of these opportunities were given to him by Emperor Thirteen.

Furthermore, Emperor Thirteen had helped him twice before, and hence Jian Wushuang was extremely grateful.

“I have already given you your opportunities, you can leave now,” Emperor Thirteen said coldly and indifferently.

Jian Wushuang felt odd.

It was true that Emperor Thirteen had given him opportunities and treasures to help him improve.

However, why had he done this? Why did he give such amazing opportunities?

What was he trying to achieve?

Emperor Thirteen did not mention this at all.

Just like he had said, he would not tell Jian Wushuang anything at all. When the time was right, Jian Wushuang would know everything.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

Before he had visited Emperor Thirteen, he had many questions that he had wanted to ask and hoped for an answer from Emperor Thirteen.

Now...The number of questions he had had only increased after what he had encountered within the head: seeing the bold man from the Ancient Display.

However, he did not ask after seeing how cold Emperor Thirteen was towards him.

“Goodbye.”

Jian Wushuang bowed before leaving the way he came.

Emperor Thirteen fell silent as he looked at Jian Wushuang as he slowly disappeared from his sight. He looked up at the bold man sitting there with a glint of uncertainty.

“There isn’t much time left. I tried my best to help the little one. Now, it’s up to him alone to reach your benchmark.”

“Old man, I hope everything that you are trying to do is worth it. I hope this little man can achieve it. If not, my Seven Star Black Sect...”

Emperor Thirteen clenched his fists tightly and said no more.
