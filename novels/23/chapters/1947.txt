1948 Emperor God Xie Xin Rejoiced With Wild Excitemen

Qing Hao responded at the first instant.

However, when he tried to send a message…

“What happened? My message can’t go through?” Qing Hao was shocked.

Then, Emperor God Xie Xin had already seen through Qing Hao’s actions. He sneered, “Young man, don’t even think about sending messages. It’s useless. I have already sealed off this spacetime. With just four Universe Gods, you can’t possibly break it. Don’t even think about running away either. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Then, there was pressing stress soaring from Emperor Xie Xin’s body.

Putong! Putong! Putong! Putong!

The four disciples from Immortal Palace, including the brown-haired young man, Qing Hao, knelt down straightaway.

Their heads were buzzing and they couldn’t come back to reality for quite some time.

Finally, Qing Hao was the first one who recovered. He clenched his teeth as he glared at Emperor God Xie Xin. He understood that the opponent was far beyond their match.

Forget about themselves, even their masters or master’s masters weren’t his match.

In other words, it was true when the opponent said that the four of them couldn’t escape.

“The four of you, answer my questions. I may let you go,” Emperor God Xie Xin smiled maliciously.

“Dream on!” Qing Hao humphed coldly.

He knew that the opponent was from outside Green Fire World and he had wicked ideas in his mind. He naturally wasn’t willing to cooperate.

“Hehe, a person of integrity!” Emperor God Xie Xin scoffed and pointed casually with his fingertip.

There was a light that burst out and instantly pierced the head of the favored one from Immortal Palace. Then, his aura vanished into thin air.

“Brother Qing Hao!!” The other three next to him looked distressed.

“As your senior has died, it’s your turn now. Answer my questions honestly or die like your senior did. Make your own choice,” Emperor God Xie Xin’s voice was cold.

With his measure of an Emperor God expert, three Universe Gods who were inexperienced naturally couldn’t withstand it.

They immediately gave him all the answers that he wanted on a silver platter.

“Green Fire World is a big world?”

After finding out about Green Fire World, even Emperor God Xie Xin was shocked.

The ancient battlefield that he was in had never had any other cultivators but him alone wandering there. But then, he had realized that there was a big world in the ancient battlefield?

And the big world seemed to be nurtured from the battlefield?

A big world that was nurtured from the ancient battlefield, just how terrifyingly valuable was the world?

“That’s not right,” Emperor God Xie Xin shook his head, “The spiritual influence of heaven and earth here in the ancient battlefield is so much more intense. The cultivation environment was much more outstanding than the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. On top of that, the ancient battlefield is a land of opportunities. Just how strong were the experts from Green Fire World?”

Emperor God Xie Xin became alert at the first instant.

With such outstanding cultivation environment, the overall power of a cultivator shouldn’t be any weaker.

“Who is the strongest person in Green Fire World? How strong is he?” Emperor God Xie Xin asked straightforwardly.

One of the disciples from Immortal Palace answered, “The strongest person in Green Fire World is naturally the Wushuang City Master. He built Wushuang City himself and it is no doubt the number one sanctuary. Countless experts fought to cultivate in Wushuang City. However, rules applied. Although Green Fire World has nine top forces, none of the nine top forces dare to go against Wushuang City Master’s command. He is widely acknowledged as the strongest one!”

“As for Wushuang City Master’s power, no one knew. We only knew that our masters, or even our master’s master, said that they aren’t Wushuang Master’s match.”

“At which level are your master and your master’s master at?” Emperor God Xie Xin continued to question them.

“Our master is a Void Real God, as for our master’s master, the Master of Immortal Palace, he was an Eternal Real God, the top Eternal Real God!” The disciple from Immortal Palace answered honestly.

Emperor God Xie Xin heard the disciple from Immortal Palace’s answer and he was surprised.

“The Palace Master of one of the nine top forces is only an Eternal Real God? How could he be so weak?” Emperor God Xie Xin was confused but then he finally understood after a round of questions.

“Haha, I see!”

“It turned out that Green Fire World had only started evolving in the past ten thousand years. The cultivation environment here was terrible. They didn’t even have any Universe Gods. Then, somehow or other, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth became more intense. On top of that, the expert from Green Fire Wold somehow received some cultivation guidance. Hence, the experts in Green Fire World slowly grew.”

“No wonder. In such an outstanding cultivation environment, the Palace Master of one of the nine forces is only an Eternal Real God.”

Emperor God Xie Xin smiled and his smile looked malicious. There was boundless surprise in his eyes too.

“Great, that’s great!”

“Even heaven is helping me!”

“Previously, I found the ancient battlefield that was totally sealed off from Eternal Chaotic World. Then, I found another big world that possesses great potential!”

An Emperor God, Emperor God Xie Xin naturally could tell the value of Green Fire World.

Although Green Fire World had yet to develop, it was like a newborn baby. It required time to slowly grow. Once it was fully-grown, it was simply unimaginable how great of a level it would reach!

Emperor God Xie Xin found out about the situation of Green Fire World and instantly had many wicked ideas pop into his head.

Conquer Green Fire World and make Green Fire World into his private backyard!

“Let’s go. Let’s head to Green Fire World!”

Emperor God Xie Xin immediately forced the three disciples from Immortal Palace to lead the way to Green Fire World.

In the beginning, he was worried about the standard of the experts in Green Fire World. But now, he didn’t care much.

Even Palace Master from the nine strongest forces was merely Eternal Real God level. The so-called supreme Wushuang City Master couldn’t be that powerful.

From Emperor God Xie Xin’s point of view, Wushuang City Master would at most be a Chaotic Real God. He reckoned that he shouldn’t be the top among Chaotic Real Gods as well.

As for Almighty?

Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t consider that at all.

There weren’t many Almighties from Eternal Chaotic World. It wasn’t a level that one could easily achieve.

Even if Wushuang City Master had already broken through and become an Almighty, he wouldn’t care.

One should know that he was an Emperor God. Plus, as he had wandered in the ancient battlefield for over twelve thousand years, he was very powerful.

Hence, he didn’t bother much.

Just a Green Fire World, he could overtake it easily alone.

Very soon, Emperor God had reached the entrance of Green Fire World and Green Fire Palace under the lead of the disciples from Immortal Palace.
