Chapter 1314: The Arrival of Inverse Cultivation Test and The First Divine Thunder

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang sat on the peak of the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle with his eyes closed, just like an old monk in deep meditation.

In the surroundings of the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, if it could have been described as noisy when the experts were in discussion among themselves earlier, then it was now dead silent.

Dead silent.

There were no other noises.

The reason wasn’t that the experts didn’t want to talk among themselves but because they were astonished by the thundercloud gathered in the void above.

Ten days, a total of ten days!

The thundercloud in the void above continuously gathered and were constantly saving more power.

The thundercloud only covered the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle at the beginning but it then expanded to a range of a few hundred thousand miles.

The experts who were waiting around the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle retreated to a few hundred thousand miles away as they were afraid that they might be within range of the terrifying God’s Test. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The most crucial part was that the pressure from the thundercloud constantly turned stronger as the thunderclouds continue to expand.

In the ten days, the pressure from the thundercloud had reached an unbelievable level!

The power was too strong. Even though they were out of the coverage of the thunderclouds, even though the pressure wasn’t aimed at them, it still scared the wits out of the experts at the scene and made their hairs stand on end.

Their eyes were wide open in terror and they couldn’t even utter a word.

“Too… too powerful!”

Even the two Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang were both in an unprecedented state of horror.

“Wu Cang, when you undergo the third God’s Test, was the pressure given out from the thundercloud this powerful?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked.

“No,” Wu Cang shook his head, “How about you?”

“My third God’s Test was a fire test and it was known to be terrifying but I feel that it couldn’t be compared to the power of Jian Wushuang’s God’s Test in the First Heaven,” the Master of Dayu Palace said.

Then, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wushuang gasped simultaneously.

God’s Test was supposed to be more and more powerful.

As for the God’s Test in the Third Heaven, supposedly the last God’s test, it should be ridiculously powerful.

However, they felt that the pressure spread from the thundercloud when they underwent their God’s Test in the Third Heaven couldn’t match with Jian Wushuang’s God Test in the First Heaven.

What’s going on?

Just then…

Rumble!

In the middle of the huge thundercloud that covered a range of ten of hundred thousand miles, there was a fierce roar suddenly.

The thunder roared and shocked all the experts gathered around Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

“It’s going to start!”

Everyone held their breath and looked towards Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

On the peak of the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, Jian Wushuang, who had been sitting in peace as though he was in complete isolation, finally opened his eyes.

“Is it coming?”

Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked at the sky. Even though the pressure from the thundercloud was terrifying, he was extremely calm on the inside.

“Jian Wushuang,” a low voice was heard, “I have been living off you for a few thousand years. In the few thousand years, I could give you advice and assist you whenever you come across any danger or trouble. However, you have to depend on yourself this time.”

“Mm.” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly, “Go ahead.”

Jian Wushuang waved and a red stream flowed.

Jian Wushuang could only undergo the Inverse Cultivation Test on his own. If he failed to, he would definitely vanish into thin air. If King of Venomous Worms were to stay in his body, he would definitely be involved. Hence, he had to leave.

“King of Venomous Worms, if I were to die in the Inverse Cultivation Test, please head back to the Eternal Chaotic World on your own and look for a new Ancient God. If you can’t find any Ancient Gods in a short time, you can opt to return to the Green Fire World and back to Star Foggy Sea. You can at least stay alive until the new Ancient God descends,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I know,” King of Venomous Worms looked into Jian Wushuang’s eyes and said solemnly, “Jian Wushuang, don’t give up even when you reach the last critical moment. You must pass the test!”

Then, King of Venomous Worms dug downwards and disappeared very quickly.

After Jian Wushuang heard that, he smiled and lifted his head again.

“Inverse Cultivation Test!”

“It’s the scariest God’s Test in Eternal Chaotic World. Besides, I am a Four-Star Imperial Ancient God at the highest level. After I pass through this test, it’ll be followed by the Ancient God’s Test straightaway!”

“Haha, God thought too highly of me. However, no one can take my life as they wish!”

“Even if He’s a God!!!”

“Inverse Cultivation Test, Ancient God Test… Come on!”

Jian Wushuang had light spurting out from his eyes and his body suddenly grew into a three-meter tall bronze Ancient God. In the middle of his eyebrows, there was an upside down Four-Star where surging power flowed out ferociously.

“Roar!!!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and it shook the earth.

In the middle of the thundercloud which covered tens of thousands of miles above him, it seemed to received Jian Wushuang’s provocation. The terrifying thundercloud raged.

The universe roared.

Rumble!

The loud rumble was from the core of the thundercloud, right in the middle of the boundless power. There was a bolt of purplish gold lightning which was as thick as a pail that struck through the thundercloud and descended to the earth.

The moment the lightning appeared, there was a terrifying power that seemed as though it could destroy the earth spreading across.

The moment the experts gathered around Tribunal Passing Pinnacle saw the purplish gold lightning, they were paralyzed with fear.

“Purplish gold!!!”

Some inner disciples of the Dayu Palace couldn’t help but let out an exclamation.

In God’s Test, the most commonly seen was thunder test. The purplish gold lightning obviously belonged to thunder test.

However, there were different level in thunder test too. For instance, when Universe God Dong Men underwent the God Test in the Second Heaven, his second divine lightning was gilded.

Then, the divine thunder that Jian Wushuang was dealing with was in purplish gold!

The purplish gold lightning was much stronger compared to the gilded lightning back then!

On the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, Jian Wushuang who had already become a bronze Ancient God stared at the purplish gold lightning that was above him, and there was madness in his eyes!

“Purplish gold divine lightning?”

“A divine lightning of such level isn’t even worth it for me to take defense!”

Jian Wushuang let out a bellow and he waved to take off his Blood-killing Plate Armor. He stripped his upper body naked and exposed his Ancient God body on the peak. He stared at the purplish gold lightning as it descended but he didn’t look like he was going to block the strike at all!

He, wanted to resist the terrifying purplish gold lightning with his divine body directly!
