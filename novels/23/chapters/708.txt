Chapter 709: Trap! Trap!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the battlefield, under the bold offensive from Wu Dao and Dao Mei, both of Jian Wushuang’s Original Bodies plateaued and were defeated.

Right at that moment, a figure dashed out of the jungle and appeared on the battlefield.

“Very busy here, I see.”

A burly man wrapped in black robes and a foul mood showed up.

“Long Tao!”

Wu Dao and Dao Mei eyes widened and jaws dropped in shock when they saw the man.

Jian Wushuang looked at him as well.

Long Tao, a genius disciple from the Immortal Dynasty, was a superior Divine Realm expert whose battle strength rivaled Wu Dao.

“What are you doing here?” Wu Dao said, staring coldly at Long Tao.

“I just passed by and noticed the energy fluctuations, so I thought I’d have a look. To my surprise, you two battled a disciple in the Skyscraping Realm Level from the Ancient Sect. Embarrassing to say the least,” Long Tao said and laughed at them.

“Long Tao, you are an old disciple in the Immortal Dynasty, so you shouldn’t be in the Eternal Zone. Why are you still here?” Dao Mei looked at Long Tao and said, “If I’m correct, your purpose is the same as ours, you also wish to kill Jian Wushuang.”

Long Tao furrowed his brow, but didn’t reply.

Dao Mei and Wu Dao received their answer when they saw Long Tao’s reaction.

Beyond doubt, Long Tao’s goal was also Jian Wushuang.

“Since we have the same goal, how about you fight with us to kill Jian Wushuang. What say you?” Dao Mei said in a lighter tone.

“Fight with you?”

Long Tao glanced and grinned at Wu Dao and Dao Mei. “I can fight alongside you two, but I desire all his treasures after he is vanquished.”

“What?” Wu Dao’s face reddened.

“Sure.” Dao Mei nodded and talked to Wu Dao in a low voice. “Calm down. Our task is only to kill Jian Wushuang, not to seize his treasures. Since Long Tao desires them, then just let him take what he pleases. Moreover, when Jian Wushuang is dead, Xuan Yi will definitely search for the murderer. It will prove safer for us to let him keep the treasures.”

Upon hearing that, although Wu Dao’s facial muscles tightened up in unwillingness, he begrudgingly nodded.

“Good! Then let us work together to kill this Ancient Sect genius,” Long Tao said, a cunning grin spreading across his face.

“Hmm,” Wu Dao and Dao Mei nodded solemnly. The next moment, these three all turned to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s World Body and Slaughter Body stood side by side and stared coldly at Wu Dao, Dao Mei and Long Tao.

“It seems in the Eternal Zone, not only the Cloud Sea Asgard, but also the Immortal Dynasty wants me dead. I wonder what the attitude of Boundless Demon Sect is?”Jian Wushuang thought, but didn’t worry about the crisis at all.

“I only?planned?to trick the Cloud Sea Asgard, but since the Immortal Dynasty joins us, then that’s not my fault.”

His eyes beamed with bloodlust. The next moment, the Emperor Sword glided toward the Void. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Boom! The dazzling sword light cut the clouds. It seemed it would split the sky down the middle.

Wu Dao, Dao Mei and Long Tao all stood in bewilderment. They didn’t comprehend Jian Wushuang’s intentions.

“What’s this kid doing?” Wu Dao sneered.

However, when the heavy footsteps reverberated through the void, his smile froze.

As the footsteps grew nearer, hundreds of giant creatures popped up from the dense jungle.

These giants all stood taller than three meters. Most of them gleamed bronze with only a few silver.

The most obvious giant was the one enveloped by a golden light. It was gigantic and towered almost ten meters.

Demon Gods!

A large number of Demon Gods, full ten!

Four of them were Silver-armored and one was the Gold-armored Demon God!

These Demon Gods popped up from the jungle. The next moment, they flew towards Wu Dao, Dao Mei and Long Tao.

Wu Dao, Dao Mei and Long Tao, three superior Divine Realm experts gawked in shock.

Pure shock.

They wandered the Eternal Zone for a long time and fought Demon Gods including Silver-armored Demon Gods many times. However, they realized how terrifying these Demon Gods were.

Usually, the battle strength of a Silver-armored Demon God was on par with theirs, or even stronger.

Fortunately, the Demon Gods were all separated at the outside layer. That gave them a chance to break through one by one. It took them seven days to defeat them and also gained some Demon God Essence Blood.

But now, they never imagined this scenario.

God, so many Demon Gods gathered together including four Silver-armored and one Gold-armored Demon God!

The Gold-armored Demon God… the best among the Demon Gods. They wandered for so many days, yet it was their first time witnessing a Gold-armored Demon God.

“These Demon Gods, are, are drawn by Jian Wushuang!” Dao Mei glared at Jian Wushuang.

Before Jian Wushuang split the sky with his sword, they were all confused. But now, as they faced these Demon Gods, they understood what he did.

“Trap!”

“A trap!”

Dao Mei roared suddenly.

“It’s a trap! That bastard, Jian Wushuang works with these Demon Gods!” Long Tao said furiously.

“How is this possible? Why do these Demon Gods aid him?” Wu Dao said in disbelief.

But even though it proved difficult for them to accept, such was a fact.

The Demon Gods flew to the battlefield. They ignored Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies and instead rushed towards him.

“Run!”

“Run!”

They ignored Jian Wushuang and ran away without hesitation.

“Run?”

“Now? It’s far too late for that!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the three fleeing and clasped his hands.

He set this trap for Wu Dao and Dao Mei, but to his surprise, Long Tao fell into it as well.

The trap was very simple. He used himself as the target to attract Wu Dao and Dao Mei. Then he negotiated for the Demon Gods to rip them to shreds.

It was a simple plan but Wu Dao, Dao Mei and even Long Tao wouldn’t know the Demon God Clan allied themselves with him. That was why they fell into the trap.
