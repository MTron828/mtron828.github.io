Chapter 2082 Submission!

“The pinnacle of Second Stage, the best around!”

“Even if I got caught up with a Third Stage Great Emperor like that Demon King Chen Yu, I won’t be able to defeat him per se, but at least I’ll be able to put up a fight.”

Jian Wushuang clutched his hands as he felt the greatly improved Bloodline Power flowing within him along with the power to controlling surrounding timespace. He was ecstatic.

He had analysed previously, and as long as he improved in understanding in Timespace Doctrine or Reincarnation Doctrine, he would reach the pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor levels.

Now, not only had he made that step forward in the Timespace Doctrine, he was now a nine-star Ancient God too. Naturally he was now stronger than previously expected!

“Thank you O’ Ancient Emperor!” Jian Wushuang bowed in front of him, but this time it was sincere.

After all, the Ancient God Emperor was the reason behind this newfound strength.

“Haha, no need to thank me. If you are able to lead the Ancient God Clan out of that calamity… simply keeping the Clan alive will be good enough for me,” The Ancient God Emperor laughed heartily.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, what calamity are you referring to?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“No need to rush, you’ll encounter it soon, or maybe you’ve already have. Time will tell,” The Ancient God Emperor smiled faintly. “The reason I left my strand of consciousness here was to find a new leader for the Ancient God Clan. Now that I have, this Residence and my consciousness, he has no reason to be around.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As he spoke, Jian Wushuang could feel the surrounding Residence shaking crazily.

This form of vibration was violent in unprecedented degrees as major boulders collapsed.

At the same time, the already hazy, translucent figure that was the Ancient God Emperor’s consciousness was beginning to fade away.

Jian Wushuang naturally understood what was happening. With a deep breath, he took another bow. “Farewell, O’ Great Emperor.”

The Ancient God Emperor kept that smile the entire way, eyes fixated on Jian Wushuang as he eventually became nothing.

Ancient God Emperor, the super expert of the First Era, had now vanished.

…

Outside the residence, King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu and other experts from the Ancient God Clan were waiting quietly.

What Jian Wushuang did outside the gates was within their line of sight.

But as the gates opened, what happened after Jian Wushuang entered? No one knew.

They waited for three days, and nothing.

“It’s already been three days, what is the Sword Emperor doing inside?” King Chen Xing was stone faced.

He still did not believe Jian Wushuang would receive his father’s approval.

But at that moment…..Hong Long Long~

Such an enormous place began to shake crazily. The shaking became more and more intense, even shaking the heavens.

“What’s going on?’

“What’s happening?”

The Ancient Gods were all confused, and looked towards the grave in astonishment.

Suddenly, an aura of unyielding authority and magnanimity rose up from the grave to the heavens.

Slowly, it formed a hazy figure of a man in gold robes.

The experts all seemed like ants, being so high above the heavens.

“This aura…”

King Chen Xing stared daggers at that figure that rose from the grave.

“Father!” Chen Xing called out immediately.

“King!”

“O’ my king!”

The Ancient Gods below all looked up in awe and fervour.

Ancient God Emperor, the first leader of the Ancient God Clan, was an irreplaceable figure for many Ancient Gods.

And now, the Ancient God Emperor spoke slowly as the rest watched. That unyielding authority could be felt in his voice as it resonated around the entire area.

“From today onwards, Jian Wushuang will be the new leader of the Ancient God Clan!”

“All clansmen who dare disobey or disrespect him, will have their actions seen as open defiance. There will be no mercy for those who do as such!”

As he ended his speech, the Ancient God Emperor’s figure gradually dissipated into thin air.

The enormous grave at this moment collapsed entirely.

The entire place was now gone, along with the Ancient God Emperor’s presence and aura.

Everyone stared blankly at the ruins, yet to comprehend what had just happened.

Suddenly… from the ruins, a figure appeared.

He was not as tall as the Ancient God Emperor, but his aura of authority was no weaker than the God Emperor’s.

As he walked over step by step, as if some sort of magic, his presence and authority grew in the hearts and minds of many Ancient Gods.

Without hesitation, King Luo Yu was the first to get on his knees and greet Jian Wushuang. “Greetings Ancient Emperor!”

“Greetings Ancient Emperor!”

The many seven and eight-starred Ancient Gods did the same.

Even the nine-starred Ancient God King Zhan Cang, after being slightly shaken up, got down on his knees as well.

Only one remained standing – King Chen Xing.

Jian Wushuang, with his gaze of unyielding authority, gazed upon King Chen Xing. A strong Bloodline power was applied to King Chen Xing immediately.

“King Chen Xing, do you insist on being this way?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

King Chen Xing trembled, and finally showed a bitter smile.

He took a deep breath. In front of others, he bent the knee, and greeted Jian Wushuang with a strong resounding voice. “Chen Xing, here to greet O’ Ancient Emperor, from this day forward, your wish is my command, and if I disobey, may the heavens punish me!”

Finally, a smile could be seen on Jian Wushuang.

…

Luo Wang City, inside a great hall.

The strongest experts from the Ancient God were all there. King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu, King Zhan Cang, along with the lords King Gu You and King Tong and the other clan leaders, were all present.

There was almost a hundred people packed inside the hall.

They represented almost all of the Ancient God Clan.

And on the top of the hall, on that unique, mighty throne, sat Jian Wushuang.

The Ancient Gods below all looked up to Jian Wushuang in awe and fervour.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, I have asked the clansmen to start the coronation ceremony preparations. It can proceed one month from now,” King Luo Yu said respectfully.

“The ceremony can wait. No rush.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

A new champion and a new leader had emerged, naturally a grand ceremony was necessary. But circumstances were dire, and Jian Wushuang had no time for anything else.

“King Chen Xing,” Jian Wushuang said.
