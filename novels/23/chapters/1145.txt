Chapter 1146: A Fierce Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Buzz!”

Jian Wushuang brandished his Blood Mountain Sword again, sending out a beam of sword light. It cracked through the void and quickly expanded into a shining Sword River.

He approached Golden Rock King and launched an all-out attack on the latter, his eyes brightened with excitement.

Beams after beams of sword light were shot out toward Golden Rock King with amazing speed and ferocity.

“You want to play hard? So let’s play hard!” shouted Golden Rock King.

He wielded the pair of giant axes in his hands and gave full play to his powers, his eyes filled with anger.

“Swoosh ! Swoosh ! Swoosh ! Swoosh !”

Axe Shadows full of great vigor darted toward Jian Wushuang without a break.

Soon enough, they clashed with Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

This fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Golden Rock King dragged the surrounding space into an apocalypse-like state of chaos. Harsh, disagreeable combination of sounds reverberated across the battlefield.

“This brat…”?Golden Rock King watched Jian Wushuang malevolently but meanwhile, he could not help feeling astonished deep inside his heart.

He was astounded at the performance of this young man.

He had never expected the youth to have such a great battle strength.

As far as he knew, Jian Wushuang had displayed his powers during the battle in the Loyalty Palace not long ago, and at that time, his powers had been barely comparable to those of a Holy Master with top-notch Exceptional Realm.

He counted the years and found out that only a few decades had passed since the battle in the Loyalty Palace. As such, he felt even puzzled about the current situation.

He was a powerful Universe Master and well-know for his battle strength. However, even he could not defeat Jian Wushuang in a short time in a stand-up fight.

What surprised him even more was Jian Wushuang’s self-protection ability. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Why does Jian Wushuang look absolutely uninfluenced after so many head-on collisions? Every time I exerted a forward force on an Axe Shadow, it exerted an equal and opposite force on me. Such forces sapped my battle strength and even slighty hurt me. How come he seems immune to such forces?”?thought Golden Rock King, his gaze fixed upon Jian Wushuang.

Since the beginning of this fierce battle, Jian Wushang’s sword light and Golden Rock King’s Axe Shadows had clashed head-on for more than 100 times.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang was still alive and kicking. He even looked more combative and energetic than before.

Tianying King and Tianhuan King, who had been standing by and watching the fight all this while, remained silent, but their gaze turned harsh.

“Now I see why that person ordered the three of us to deal with this Jian Wushuang. He has been making fast progress all this while,” Tianhuan King said in a low voice.

“I used to engage him in battle outside the Loyalty Palace. Back then, I severely wounded him by giving him just one whiplash, and he didn’t have any energy left to struggle, not mention to counterattack after getting the blow. If Sunrise Sword Emperor hadn’t come to his rescure in time, I would’ve have killed him. However, now… he’s much stronger than before. Even I would feel a lack of confidence in facing off against him,” said Tianying King, his hands clenched into tight fists.

“Fortunately, we’ve come here in time. He has not yet become a Holy Master. If he does, maybe only our monarch is able to compete with him,” said Tianhuan King.

“Anyway, he’s dead today,” Tianying King said with a murderous look on his face and then summoned his black Long Whip.

“Golden Rock King, I’m coming to help you.”

With these words, he dashed toward at incredibly high speed, looking like a fleeting phantom.

Upon seeing Tianying King coming to join the fight, Golden Rock King frowned but did not say anything.

“Another one?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed, his face solemn.

“Shoo!”

Tianying King flung his whip forward. The black whip, which looked like a big python, somehow penetrated the void and then appeared straight in front of Jian Wushuang.

“That’s fast!”

Jian Wushuang exclaimed in his heart, while brandishing his Blood Mountain Sword to fend it off. After he stabbed the tip of his sword into the most vulnerable place of the big python, the python quickly withdrew.

“He could easily spot my most vulnerable point and fend off my attack. He does have superb sword skills,” said Tianying King.

He did not know that it was Jian Wushuang who had created the strongest set of swordplay techniques—Swordplay of Coalescence.

He was so versed in the art of the sword and had mastered nearly all kinds of sword skills. That was why Tianying King could never compete with him in this aspect.

“Now, it’s my turn!”

Golden Rock King shouted loudly and then suddenly squatted. Fueled by a sharp killing intent, he lifted his giant axes up above his head. A seemingly boundless Axe Shadow gradually came into being over his head and covered almost the entire sky.

The whole world dimmed dramatically the moment the Axe Shadow was formed.

Now, this Axe Shadow was the focus of everyone’s attention. It quickly fell toward Jian Wushuang as Golden Rock King swung his axe toward the youth.

“This Axe Shadow…”

The color of Jian Wushuang’s face slightly changed, as he could clearly detect the dreadful energy contained in this falling Axe Shadow.

He had exchanged many moves with Golden Rock King by far, but the latter had never used such a technique before.

In the face of such a formidable Axe Shadow, Jian Wushuang intuitively wanted to fend off the attack with his sword. However, before he could manage to do that, he was attacked by an invisible force.

He felt as if he had been stabbed in the head by a sharp needle coated with a deadly poison.

“Is this a consciousness attack?

“And an exceptionally ferocious one?”

Jian Wushuang thought with a glum face. Nevertheless, he still managed to brandish his Blood Mountain Sword the next moment.

“Boom!”

The explosion blasted a large pothole in the void.

Jian Wushuang flew out from the center of the pothole like a bullet and then bumped into a distant mountain which was tall and rugged.

The next moment, the mountain exploded and Jian Wushuang flew out again.

He stood in the void, excitedly looking at the three Universe Masters.

Tianhuan King, Golden Rock King and Tianying King stood side by side, looking stunned and somewhat gloomy.

“That Axe Shadow is the strongest one that I can summon. How come he survived it without a scratch? And how did he manage to take it after taking your consciousness attack, Tianhuan King?” Golden Rock King voiced his doubts first.

“I also launched the consciousness attack with all my strength just now. Why did it have no influence on him? It even didn’t delay his movements!” Tianhuan King exclaimed in surprise.

Back in Seven Stars Pagoda, Jian Wushang had managed to fend off her consciousness attack and crack the illusion she had created.

Now, her strongest consciousness attack failed to influence Jian Wushuang once again.

“How long has he lived? Why does he have such a potent consciousness?” Tianhuan King exclaimed in astonishment.

“This brat is not weak, and we must go all-out to kill him. If we let him survive, he’ll become a nightmare for the Jin Kingdom in the future!” Tianying King said in a deep voice.
