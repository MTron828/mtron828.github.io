“Which way?” Jian Wushuang looked over.

“Very simple. I’ll let you join the ranking battle as a Snow Dojo disciple,” Wu Cang replied.

“I’ll join the battle?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“This is the best way,” Wu Cang said, “The ranking battle between Snow Dojo and the Universe God Palace is divided into three fights. One between the Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, one between the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, and one between the Universe Gods in the First Heaven. The party who wins two fights out of the three will be the final winner. Then, we will be able to compete with the comprehensive level of disciples from Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace.

“Among the three ranking fights in this session, Snow Dojo only has a higher winning chance in the fight between the Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. The other two fights have a lower chance of winning. But if you were to join the fight between Universe Gods in the First Heaven as Snow Dojo’s disciple, you’d definitely win!”

“Then, Snow Dojo would be able to win two fights and be the victor of the ranking battle. The Master of Silence Gloriette would definitely be thrilled. At that point, I’ll ask him on your behalf regarding the route to the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. It’ll be much easier.”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows when he heard Wu Cang’s suggestion.

He thought Wu Cang’s idea was great but as a prerequisite, he still had to join Snow Dojo.

Although he was confident with himself, it wasn’t necessary that he would win if he joined the ranking battle.

“Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to worry so much. The experts in Snow Dojo are free and not restrained much. Even if you join Snow Dojo, it’s your own decision as to whether you want to stay or leave. No one will force you into anything. Once you complete the ranking battle and obtain your travel route, you can leave straight away. No one will comment much.”

“Plus, if you were to win a victory for Snow Dojo in the ranking battle, you would get an opportunity to go to Tian Yuan Mystery Land,” Wu Cang added.

“Tian Yuan Mystery Land?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“It’s one of the sites of opportunity in Snow Kingdom. In the past, only experts from Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace were qualified to enter. Plus, the ranking battle only takes place every ten thousand years because Mysterious Tian Yuan only opens once every ten thousand years. Every time it opens, it is limited to a quota of thirty people. The quota will be based on the winning and losing of ranking battles!”

“If Snow Dojo were to win the ranking battle, the thirty quotas would be Snow Dojo’s. On the contrary, if Universe God Palace won, the thirty quotas would be theirs. In the past, whenever Snow Dojo won the battle, the thirty quotas would be passed to thirty experts that participated in the ranking battle. By then, of course, you would be one of them,” Wu Cang explained.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang sighed.

“Jian Wushuang, this is the best method. You will help Snow Dojo to win the ranking battle and Snow Dojo will provide you with the travel route to the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. On top of that, you will be rewarded with a chance to enter Tian Yuan Mystery Land. This is something that satisfies both parties,” Wu Cang said.

Jian Wushuang was left speechless. He then nodded faintly, “Alright, I’ll take it.”

“That’s great,” Wu Cang was beaming with joy.

He was very clear about Jian Wushuang’s power. As Jian Wushuang agreed to participate in the fight between Universe Gods in the First Heaven, that particular fight would have a ninety-nine percent winning rate.

“Jian Wushuang, follow me.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Then, Wu Cang led Jian Wushuang out from the hall.

Snow Dojo was an expert concentration camp in Snow Kingdom. Whoever could enter Snow Dojo were all experts, no one would be just ordinary.

For instance Universe God Qing Yang, who died at Jian Wushuang’s hand. When he was in Dayu World, he was once known as the top expert in Dayu World. But in Snow Dojo, he was at the bottom – or maybe he didn’t even qualify to be at the bottom.

Plus, to join Snow Dojo, one naturally had to undergo a filtering process.

Jian Wushuang had the recommendation of Wu Cang, who was a golden-dressed deacon. Hence, he could skip the process of filtration. However, he would still be required to go through the last procedure.

Wu Cang brought Jian Wushuang to a black tall tower. In front of the black tall tower, there was a drunk elderly with messy hair.

“Old Liu,” Wu Cang bowed politely at the drunk elderly.

The drunk elderly lifted his eyes and looked at Wu Cang and Jian Wushuang. He then said slowly, “It’s you, Wu Cang. Who is this next to you?”

“This is someone I got to know earlier. I saw that he was quite talented so I brought him to Snow Dojo for him to try Snow Tower,” Wu Cang said humbly.

‘Is he?” The drunk elderly nodded and waved, “There’s no one in Snow Tower. Just go ahead.”

“Thank you,” Wu Cang replied and turned to Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, go ahead. There are ten levels in total. The moment you passes through the seventh level, you’re considered to have passed. Then, you can join Snow Dojo.”

“The seventh?” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he walked towards Snow Tower.

Jian Wushuang entered Snow Tower while Wu Cang waited patiently outside.

“Ten floors in Snow Tower. I think Jian Wushuang could go all the way to the tenth floor with his power,” Wu Cang smiled faintly.

Just then… Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that descended before Snow Tower one after another.

Wu Cang looked over. His pupils contracted when he saw someone visiting.

“Wu Cang, what are you doing here?” A fairly unfriendly voice was heard. The one who spoke was a purple-haired elderly who was walking at the front.

“I’m waiting for someone,” Wu Cang looked cold.

“Who are you waiting for?” The purple-haired elderly stopped before Wu Cang.

“I got to know someone when I was wandering outside. He’s not in Snow Tower,” Wu Cang answered.

“Oh? Such a coincidence. I happened to know an expert on my way to a mission too. I brought him back to challenge Snow Tower too,” the purple-haired elderly said.

“Wu Chao, what do you mean?” Wu Cang’s face grew grave.

“Nothing. Why are you so angry? We are both golden-dressed deacons. You can bring someone over but I can’t?” The purple-haired elderly snorted.

“I have no time to deal with your nonsense,” Wu Cang turned around and didn’t bother looking at the purple-haired elderly anymore.

The purple-haired elderly pouted but kept quiet.

Soon, Jian Wushuang came out from Snow Tower.

The moment he exited Snow Tower, the drunkard at the entrance passed Jian Wushuang a token.

Jian Wushuang took over the token and walked towards Wu Cang.

“Jian Wushuang, is everything okay?” Wu Cang quickly asked.

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“How many levels did you pass?” Wu Cang asked curiously.
