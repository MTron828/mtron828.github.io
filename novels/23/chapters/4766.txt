4767 Great Battle

A celestial form of a black crow that blotted out the sky quietly appeared behind Di Qing, and its four eyes that were like the sun cast down black flames.

At that moment, even the swordsmen who were holding Jian Wushuang and the others hostage retreated.

“Enjoy it, everyone. You’ll soon feel the wrath of my arrival.”

Di Qing slowly opened his arms, and beautiful feathers began to hang down from his arms.

The two were obviously Grand Yan Immortals who had transformed their faces. They still had no expression on their faces, but from their solemn eyes, Di Qing’s words were true.

The celestial form of the black Crow roared toward the sky. All of the Yan power in the entire Celestial Prefecture gathered toward him, and with an unimaginable force, it pressed down.

Wisps of black flames appeared on the black crow celestial form. It suddenly opened its mouth and let out a cry, releasing an infinite amount of black flames.

Jian Wushuang and the others saw it clearly. Even if the black flames touched them, they would be killed or at least shed a layer of skin.

Suddenly, the young swordsman dragged Jian Wushuang backward.

“Pathetic!” Di Qing smiled coldly.

The two Grand Yan Immortals worked together again, and a pitch-black cauldron that was even larger than before blocked in front of them.

The black crows cawed and released an infinite amount of fire. It was like a curtain of rain, covering every inch of the space.

Whooosh!!!

The frightening black flames even devoured the scattered Yan power in the air. When they collided with the pitch-black cauldron, a dense sizzling sound erupted.

The earth-shaking power made the retreating people feel an indescribable tightness in their chests.

At the same time, black flames rained down on every corner of the Celestial Prefecture.

The large-scale destruction had begun!

The tens of thousands of Immortal abodes and pavilions that were touched by the black flames all collapsed and turned into dust.

The small Celestial Prefecture, which was originally full of Immortal Qi, had become a dead zone at an extremely fast speed. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Prince Mo, who was lying on the top of the Fusang Tree, felt his heart bleeding when he saw this. All his trump cards had been burned down!

“Master Di, leave some for me!” In the end, he could not help but ask.

Di Qing’s reply was a cold ‘Get lost’.

Looking at Di Qing’s back, a trace of anger and hatred flashed across Prince Mo’s eyes. However, he quickly returned to normal. After all, he could only rely on Di Qing to survive.

‘Just you wait. If I survive this, you’ll definitely die without a burial place,’ Prince Mo thought to himself.

The power emitted by the image form of the black crow alone could suppress the entire Celestial Prefecture, and no Yan Immortal dared to compete with it.

The two Grand Yan Immortals who bore 90 percent of black crow’s black flames finally exhausted their black flames at the cost of the destruction of the huge pitch-black cauldron.

Di Qing’s face turned cold, and he stretched out his hand and pointed.

Immediately, the black crow behind him raised its head and let out a shrill cry. Dragging along a terrifying black Yan power, it descended from the sky, determined to swallow the two Grand Yan Immortals.

The small Celestial Prefecture turned dark and Yan power was no longer quiet. Instead, a violent tide was produced.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang instantly burst out and used his supreme Yan power to sweep away the True Sword behind him. Then, with an extremely fast speed, he turned around and knelt down in front of the young guard.

Due to the fluctuations of the Yan power tide, all the Yan Immortals present were unable to detect the danger in time.

Therefore, by the time the young guard reacted, it was already too late. His stomach was hit by Jian Wushuang’s full strength.

With a muffled groan, he fell headfirst into the small Celestial Prefecture like a kite that had fallen off its string.

Almost at the same time, Cheng Qing and Chun Qiu also suddenly burst out, using Yan power to force the remaining four swordsmen away.

Then, Chun Qiu summoned his eight-armed Arhat to fight against the swordsmen.

“Brother Jian, let’s end this quickly!” Chen Qing pulled out the True Sword from his waist and looked at Jian Wushuang fiercely. “We will cover your retreat.”

Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. Then, he looked at Prince Mo, who was lying on the Fusang Tree, through the layers of waves of the tide.

The next moment, he stepped on the clouds and suddenly rushed forward, regardless of the great battle above his head that could destroy the world at any time.

Prince Mo, who was like a bird startled by the mere twang of a bow, immediately noticed Jian Wushuang who was flying towards him. He immediately became restless and said, “Master Di, save me!”

Di Qing turned his head impatiently. After seeing Jian Wushuang’s flying figure, he opened his palm without any hesitation and turned into thousands of strands of Yan power, surrounding him.

Thousands of Yan power turned into unparalleled chains and bound Jian Wushuang with an indescribable speed.

Yan power at this level could even kill Yan Immortals!

Jian Wushuang only felt that the air around him was a little stagnant and viscous. The thousands of chains almost instantly bound him.

A force strong enough to crush his bones and muscles was applied to his body as the chain tightened.

Seeing this, Prince Mo sneered. One of his arms had been broken by Jian Wushuang. Now that his enemy was in front of him, he stepped on the Fusang Tree without thinking and flew over. A powerful Yan power blasted out from his palm.

Looking at the thousands of chains around him, Jian Wushuang slowly closed his eyes.

Then, a small galaxy formed by seven stars appeared between his eyebrows.

It was an Immortal Style move that the broken stone bead had given Jian Wushuang.

Little Mountain and River!

Buzzz!!!

A long ripple of water, with him as the center, directly surged out. It was an immortal Style that surpassed Yan Immortal’s comprehension.

“Break!” Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. The galaxy between his eyebrows rotated and a great power was released!

The thousands of chains on his body broke and the formless water dragons broke free from the restraints and occupied his body.

Jian Wushuang was the absolute master of the mountains and rivers.

After breaking through Di Qing’s Yan power, he looked at Di Qing for the first time.

When their eyes met, Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. He stretched out his hand and waved it gently.

Suddenly, a huge phenomenon appeared!

The small Celestial Prefecture, which had already been turned into a dead zone by Di Qing’s black flames, was suddenly split in half by an unknown force.

Then, with countless gravel, wasteland, and half of the Celestial Prefecture, it smashed directly at Di Qing!

Di Qing’s eyes narrowed.

To be able to single-handedly split the entire small continent into two, was this the terrifying power that Yan Immortal could control?

Half of the small Celestial Prefecture had come from the sky.

Di Qing suppressed the surprise in his eyes and snorted coldly. He reached out his palm and clenched it.

Suddenly, the entire small Celestial Prefecture that was flying over uncontrollably stopped in its original place. Then, as if it was squeezed into a ball by an invisible palm, it was crushed into powder.

With a wave of his sleeve, the dust scattered, but Jian Wushuang was nowhere to be seen.

“Interesting. A little Yan Immortal can actually threaten me. Is this an illusion?” Di Qing looked at the figure that had gone far away with a meaningful look, but he did not make any further moves.
