On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s, Feng’s and the other’s eyes lit up.

They knew how useful it was as they had previously stayed in the Enlightenment Mountain for one month.

Especially Jian Wushuang, he had obtained a significant improvement during that month. But now cultivating here could be two times faster than before, which was even more effective!

“Don’t be too excited now.”

When Xuan Yi saw these six excited faces, he smiled and said, “Although the effect of cultivating in this Enlightenment Mountain is much better, not everyone can meditate here. In the Ancient Sect, only the inner disciples are qualified to cultivate in it.”

“Only for the inner disciples?” Bing Shan, Xuan Ying and Wu Huang suddenly felt a bit lost and disappointed.

These three were outer disciples, so they couldn’t get into the Enlightenment Mountain.

Only Jian Wushuang, Feng and Huo Ying were able to cultivate inside.

“Jian Wushuang, Feng, Huo Ying.” Xuan Ying looked at them, “You three are our inner disciples, so you can cultivate here. There are 36 cave mansions in the Enlightenment Mountain and 33 of them are occupied, so you guys can pick the those three.”

“Yes.” Feng and Huo Ying nodded immediately.

“There are 36 cave mansions in this Enlightenment Mountain?” Jian Wushuang frown and asked, “Xuan Yi Lord, you just mentioned that as long as they are inner disciples, they can cultivate in it. But there are only 36 cave mansions, so... are there only 36 inner disciples in the Ancient Sect?”

“You are already one of our disciples, so you don’t need to call me Xuan Yi Lord. The disciples here call me Xuan Yi Palace Master and you can follow them,” Xuan Yi mentioned a side point and continued, “You are right. We only have 36 inner disciples and that’s already a lot. By the way, there are no more than 36 inner disciples in the Ancient Sect.”

“Why is it?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

The Sects with strong strength in the Ancient World always took millions of disciples.

The Ancient Sect as a top Sect which only ranked behind the three magnates in the Firmament Territory, should have taken on a large number of disciples. Only 36 inner disciples sounded like this was really too few.

“We only can accept 36 people to meditate and cultivate in the Enlightenment Mountain at once and also we want to encourage the inner disciples to compete, so that’s why we only have 36,” Xuan Yi patiently explained.

“In the Ancient Sect, the inner disciples and the outer disciples can all fight for the cultivation resource.”

“There is a competition every ten years here for our disciples. Every time, some of the inner disciples who are not good enough would be replaced by the outer disciples.”

“After all, there are only 36 inner disciples but numerous outer disciples. Some of the outer disciples are real geniuses, and some were inner disciples before, so their strength is also very strong.”

“Every Sect Competition, some inner disciples whose strength are weaker would be challenged by the outer disciples but only couple of them could withstand it.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang, and the others all understood.

The Sect Competition which was held every ten years could decide the identity of disciples based on their strength, that indeed enhanced the competition between the outer and inner disciples.

As long as the outer disciples could have a fast improvement and strong strength, they could also become inner disciples.

Likewise, if the inner disciples were defeated, they would become outer disciples.

“At the previous Sect Competition which was held eight years ago, the next one will be in two years. Jian Wushuang, Feng and Huo Ying, since you three just got here, your strength is weaker than the other inner disciples or even some outer disciples. Therefore, during these two years, you need to work really hard to keep your identity,” Xuan Yi said with a mysterious smile.

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang, Feng and Huo Ying all felt a hint of pressure.

In two years, the Sect Competition would start again. Since they just joined the Ancient Sect, their strength was at the bottom, it was really not easy for them to remain inner disciples.

“However, you don’t need to worry too much. Since you are new here, you definitely will get a big improvement with the resources of the Ancient Sect. Besides, even if you become an outer disciple in two years, you can get it back in the next Sect Competition. It is held every ten years. Ten years will pass pretty fast,” Xuan Yi said and smiled.

Even though Xuan Yi tried to make them relax, they three were still nervous about it.

“Okay, so let me tell you the details about the three palaces in the Ancient Sect,” Xuan Yi continued.

“These three palaces are Dao Palace, Sword Palace and Divine Palace!”

“Dao Palace is to cultivate Dao. There are 13 Palace Masters in the Dao Palace and all of them are experts who had comprehended a super high Level Dao in the Eternal Realm. Other than that, there are numerous Vice Palace Masters who are superior Divine Realm experts, so they also have a good comprehension of Dao.”

“The Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters always gather in the Dao Palace and record their insights and opportunities which can be obtained by our disciples. You also can go to listen to their lectures and even choose to join their Sects and become their disciples.”

“Usually, the disciples here all join one Sect of the Palace Masters or Vice Palace Masters, some experts even join two or three at the same time. The masters there will guide you and help you to apply necessary Natural Treasures while you are cultivating.”

Jian Wushuang and the others were all surprised.

Almost all the disciples of the Ancient Sect joined the Sects of the Palace Masters or Vice Palace Masters in the Dao Palace?

“You just got here, so it would be better for you to choose the right masters, join their Sects and become their disciples. Even though you can only be a nominal disciple, it would be much better than for you to cultivate by yourself without any guide,” Xuan Yi said.
