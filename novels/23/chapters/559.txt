Chapter 560: Bad Blood?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang stayed inside the Holy Place, immersing himself in the Slaughter Dao, with no idea that he was being targeted by Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

During these days, he became more accustomed to the Slaughter Dao. Now, he was able to use its power much more easily.

However, he knew that this was only minor progress and that he still had a long way to go. So far, he was only able to use the power of the Slaughter Dao on its own. He was still unable to combine it with his other skills.

“Ten days have passed. Temple Master Iceberg must be running out of patience, so it’s time to give him an answer.”?Jian Wushuang smiled and went to meet Temple Master Iceberg.

Among the palaces that covered the mountain in the Holy Place, there was a scarlet one, and the owner of that palace was naturally Temple Master Iceberg.

The palace was well-decorated and the master was sitting before a table, barefoot, drinking by himself.

“I’ve yet to receive an answer from Jian Wushuang over these past 10 days.”?Temple Master Iceberg frowned. “Maybe he discovered the secrets behind the compass?”

“No, he couldn’t have.”

Temple Master Iceberg shook his head.?“The compass is not a treasure at all. Its only value is related to Ancient World Token. Since he’s still in the Saint Realm, he should still know nothing about the token, so he won’t be able to figure out anything regarding the compass.”

“Moreover, I apologized to him and flattered him as much as I could. If he is smart, he should know to avoid offending me for an object that he doesn’t know the value of.”

Temple Master Iceberg was lost in thought when a guard came and reported to him. “Temple Master, Sword Emperor is asking to see you.”

“He’s finally arrived.” Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes lit up. “Let him in.”

After the guard left, Jian Wushuang quickly walked in.

“Temple Master Iceberg,” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“Haha, Sword Emperor, finally, here you are.” Temple Master Iceberg wore a big smile and waved towards Jian Wushuang. “Come, take a seat, let’s enjoy a drink together.”

“No, but thank you. I don’t feel like drinking right now.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and continued, “Temple Master Iceberg, I’ve searched through Emperor Golden Snake’s Interspatial Ring for that compass you wanted.”

Temple Master Iceberg immediately looked toward Jian Wushuang with expectation.

“But, I’m really sorry, I didn’t find that compass,” said Jian Wushuang.

“You didn’t find it?” Temple Master Iceberg’s smile disappeared. He continued in a gentle voice, “Did you search for it carefully? I gave that compass to Golden Snake in person, and he took it with him wherever he went. It must be in his Interspatial Ring.”

“I’ve looked through the ring almost a hundred times, but I was unable to find it.” Jian Wushuang shook his head again. “Maybe, I was being too careless. After all, there are a lot of treasures in the ring and I don’t know what it looks like. Could you describe it to me? Maybe tell me its shape, size, color, or something else about it? I’ll check for it again.”

“It’s shape and size?” Temple Master Iceberg paused.

He did know that Emperor Golden Snake had a compass in his Interspatial Ring, but he had never seen it himself.

“Sword Emperor.” Temple Master Iceberg looked serious. “Frankly speaking, I didn’t actually give Golden Snake the compass myself, but it’s true that it means a lot me, so I hope that you can give it back to me, and I’ll owe you a favor, ok?”

“Owe me a favor?”?Upon hearing those words, Jian Wushuang was even more sure that the compass had to be unusual.

Otherwise, Temple Master Iceberg would not have made a promise so easily.

They both knew that it was always hard to settle a debt, maybe even harder for a master like Temple Master Iceberg.

“If it was someone else who was asking, then I might agree to their request, but this Temple Master Iceberg...”?

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly in the heart.

He had not forgotten that it was Temple Master Iceberg who had promoted the Life-death Duel between Golden Snake and him, even though he knew that, as a Saint Realm expert, Jian Wushuang would inevitably die in that battle.

Had it not been for the fact that Jian Wushuang broke through to the Slaughter Dao during the battle, he might have died already.

In one word, because of Temple Master Iceberg, he had been forced to place one foot in the grave.

He was completely enraged and would not get over it with just a simple apology.

Most importantly, Jian Wushaung understood that Temple Master Iceberg didn’t apologize to him because he felt sorry, it was only in order to get the compass.

Jian Wushuang reckoned that he would not pay attention to him at all if he did not have the compass.

“Temple Master Iceberg, few people in the Monster-exterminating League would dare to refuse a favor from you. But, I’m terribly sorry, I’m unable to find the compass you want in the ring,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

He told a lie with a straight face.

Temple Master Iceberg looked grave.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The master’s voice turned icy as he called Jian Wushuang by his name.

“I’ve shown enough respect to you. Don’t force me to do this the hard way.” Temple Master Iceberg gazed at Jian Wushuang and said, “The compass is useless to you, so just give it to me or...” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Or?” Jian Wushuang showed a cold look. “Or you’ll kill me on spot and then seize the Interspatial Ring?”

Temple Master Iceberg paused.

Even though he was one of the most powerful Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League, he was not the strongest. There was another terrifying person, Temple Master Black Spirit, who was superior to him.

Therefore, he dared not kill Jian Wushuang while inside the Holy Place.

“Jian Wushuang, do you really want there to be bad blood between us?” Temple Master Iceberg asked frigidly.

“No, of course not. I just simply didn’t see the compass in the ring.” Jian Wushuang answered in a low voice.

However, he sneered in the heart.?“Show me respect? It was only because you wanted the compass.”

“When you saw it wasn’t working, you even tried to threaten me.”

“Shame on you, Temple Master Iceberg!”
