Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Haha, interesting!”

There was excitement shimmering in Emperor God Xue Gu’s eyes. He noticed the terrifying power contained in the lofty continent. Not only was he not afraid, he was filled with excitement.

The stronger the power of the lofty continent represented, the more amazing the Chaos Divine Treasure was.

And he definitely has to get ahold of the Chaos Divine Treasure.

“Secret skill of Blood-thirst, Ternary in One Breath!”

Emperor God roared and there were three huge, lofty shadows of Exotic Beast. The three shadows were unique but they shared a similarity. They were all soaring with rage.

The crimson trident in his hand let out three different powers simultaneously.

Suddenly, the power burst out.

Heaven and Earth were instantly silent.

In the unprecedented silence, the lofty continent that was descending from the sky collided with the crimson trident.

Rumble. Heaven fell and the earth was razed.

The huge triangle island below Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Xue Gu started falling and immersed under the sea.

The island vanished into thin air along with the dark storm.

The four figures in black robe were in the void far away. They felt the collision of two terrifying power and the four Sir Gods revealed a terrified expression.

However, just as Jian Wushuang exchanged blows with Emperor God Xue Gu using Mountain River Map, at the bottom of the sea in the vast Buddhist Demon Sea…

A young man’s consciousness, which was asleep for God knows how long, suddenly woke up with a start.

“This is… the aura of Nine-province continent!”

“Nine-province continent that was refined and made into treasure many years ago. It was in the hands of Seven Star Black Sect and it was named Mountain River Map…”

“Seven Star Black Sect’s Mountain River Map appeared here? Haha, God is helping me.”

“Go, kill all of the nonentities and bring back all their treasures.”

An ancient voice spoke and a black shadow departed from the deep ends of Buddhist Demon Sea at an unbelievably fast speed in the direction of Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Xue Gu.

…

They remained in the void above the triangle island but the triangle island had already vanished into thin air.

The two terrifying power were clashed vigorously and shook the earth.

But suddenly, the three rays of crimson light burst out like three bloody suns that swept out all hindrances.

The lofty continent that descended from the scroll painting world, although it was magnificent, cracked into three parts under the massive hit of three bloody suns and shattered completely.

The sight made Jian Wushuang’s expression grow distressed.

He didn’t perform Mountain River Map often but every time he performed it, it never disappointed him.

But then, the first seal of Mountain River Map that he had performed with his all was broken apart by his enemy.

“Emperor God Xue Gu lives up to his name!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but compliment. However, he didn’t feel hopeless.

Nine-province Nine Seals and he was merely performing the first seal then.

One should know that his divine power was great and he had already broken six Ancient God stars. Then, he was already qualified to perform the second seal.

“The last trump card!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were flashing and he fixed his gaze upon Emperor God Xue Gu. At the next moment, the vast power of stars instantly swept out from his body.

Secret Skills of Star Palace was finally cast!

Secret Skills of Star Palace, River Mountain Map, Star Destruction Skill were all his biggest trump cards. He wouldn’t perform those techniques hastily.

But then, Jian Wushuang spared nothing. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Nine-province of the universe, Yu Province as the seal, Hack the Earth!”

Terrifying divine power billowed.

Rumble!!!!

Heaven and earth shook vigorously. From the sky in the beautiful scroll painting, there was another lofty continent that descended.

The lofty continent was much bigger than the first. It was much loftier and more imposing. It was far beyond the first piece of the continent, far stronger.

“Nine-province Nine Seals, first split the heavens, secondly hack the earth!”

One was supposed to be stronger than another seal.

Most importantly, the second seal was backed up with the power of Stars.

Jian Wushuang performed the second episode of secret skill of Star Palace with all his strength.

In an instant, the order of Heaven Way seemed to be breaking apart.

Under the hack-the-earth seal, Emperor God Xue Gu, who had been smiling madly, finally stiffened.

In the distant void, the four Sir God experts turned pale. Even though they were far away, they could feel the power contained in the hack the earth seal.

The power struck fear in them and they were shivering hopelessly.

“It’s impossible for him to be that strong,” Emperor God Xue Gu’s hair instantly stood and his face distorted in agony.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

Emperor God Xue Gu’s body let out three roars. Then, he spat a mouthful of blood. His blood wasn’t red but a scalding gold.

The mouthful of scalding gold blood fell onto his crimson trident. Then, the crimson trident instantly became unusually violent.

“Drive weapon with blood, slaughter a God with a hundred ghosts!”

“Secret skill… Ternary splits heaven and earth!”

Hong!

A terrifying power suddenly exploded from the crimson trident. Emperor God Xue God had boundless divine power and energy flow out of his body.

Obviously, Emperor God Xue Gu gave his all too.

“Kill!”

A loud roar that sounded like it was outside the highest heavens struck fear into them.

The three tips of the crimson trident flooded with crimson light. The crimson trident suddenly increased in size. It was originally the size of an ordinary divine weapon but it grew in size by tens of thousands of times and became an unbelievable mountain.

The three resplendent yet enchanting crimson lights burst out and hit the lofty continent that descended brutally.

“Life or death depends on this hit!”

Jian Wushuang looked determined and there was unprecedented insanity on his face.

He already flashed all his trump cards and skills he had to brew his strongest hit.

If the hit were to kill Emperor God Xue Gu, he would be able to live.

On the contrary, if Emperor God Xue Gu were to survive the hit, he would… definitely die!

Emperor God Xue Gu was as mad as he was. He obviously knew of the situation as well.

Their lives and deaths were decided by the last hit.

It was either life or death in a split second!

In the void, the crimson trident that grew to the size of a mountain collided with the lofty continent that descended.

Bang!

The space-time instantly paused, the Yin and Yang crisscrossed, and the universe fell apart.

A black hole that covered the expanse of a million miles appeared from nowhere.

The black hole swallowed everything in the universe with no mercy. The four Sir Gods afar revealed an unprecedentedly terrified expression in that moment as they could feel the horror of the black hole. If they weren’t far off, the black hole could totally strangle them to death.
