“Swordsman, let me introduce them,” Lei Dao pulled Jian Wushuang and said.

“This is Boozer, a crazy drunk.” Lei Dao pointed at a white-robed young man, who looked drunk. With skittish eyes, the man seemingly led a dissolute life.

“This is Yao Mei, a completely evil spirit.”

Jian Wushuang saw the beautiful lady with a hot figure staring at him with a spurious smile. He was scared.

“This is Yun He.” Lei Dao pointed to a middle-aged man, whose mild smile was like a gentle spring breeze.

“You have fought with Shi Ling, so no need to introduce him,” Lei Dao said.

“I’m Swordsman, nice to meet you,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Swordsman, you have an amazing skill. Even Shi Ling lost to you. You’re really powerful,” Yao Mei said.

Hearing this, Shi Ling could not help but curl his lips. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Small tricks. It doesn’t deserve a mention,” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“It’s not a small trick. Such a powerful technique would help you a lot in a fight,” Yun He looked over and said seriously, “Moreover, you’re already so fast and have a powerful body. Maybe you’re not the strongest among us, but looking just at your ability to protect yourself, you would be number one!”

“That’s true.” Lei Dao, Yao Mei and other commanders nodded in agreement.

“Even if you can’t fight against General Qing at Stage Three, you can survive. At this point, you’re stronger than us.”

The other commanders seemingly said casually. In fact, they were envious of Swordsman’s ability.

During the fight with Shi Ling, Jian Wushuang’s overall strength might not be impressive, but his ability to defend and survive was amazing.

In this vast Divine Land, it did not matter how strong one was, as there was always someone stronger. However, it was most important for someone to have an exceptional ability of self-preservation.

As long as you could stay alive, you would have an opportunity to improve your strength.

“By the way, including myself, there are 13 commanders in our First Army, right? Where are the other commanders?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“Right, there’re 13 commanders in total. Two commanders are carrying out their tasks and the others have gone to Flaming Battlefield, so only we’re left to guard Demon Heart Canyon,” Yun He replied.

“Flaming Battlefield?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. “What’s the matter with Flaming Battlefield?”

“It’s a crazy, violent battlefield, where the two marquises have fought against each other, but we don’t know the real situation in there, because we haven’t been there,” Yun He said with a wry smile.

“You haven’t been there?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but be astonished.

“I’d like to. After all, there’re more experts in Flaming Battlefield. If I go there, I would have opportunities to fight a large number of top experts, but our lord said I’m not strong enough, so he has no plans to send me there.” Lei Dao spoke.

Jian Wushuang was shocked in private.

Lei Dao had reached Stage Two of Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. If he was not qualified to go Flaming Battlefield, what level are the experts who were battling in Flaming Battlefield?

“Don’t think too much. Just improve yourself. If your strength improves, our lord will send us there in the future,” Yun He said.

“You’re right.” Lei Dao nodded and then grinned. “Commander Swordsman has just arrived. Let’s hold a party to welcome him. Let’s go for a drink.”

The commanders walked into a tent and started drinking.

Jian Wushuang stayed in Demon Heart Canyon.

He usually cultivated by himself. Sometimes he would spar with the other commanders. They all got along well with each other.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Over at the campsite, Jian Wushuang stood in the air while emanating his Sword Realm. Yun He was trapped within it. With the help of Tenfold Realm, Jian Wushuang used his full strength to launch attacks. Although Yun He could parry all of them, he was still at a disadvantage.

“Guess how long Yun He can persist?”

Lei Dao asked with a smile. He was sitting by a long narrow table with Yao Mei, Boozer, and Shi Ling above the void.

“If he can hold for 20 breaths worth of time, that’s awesome.” Shi Ling glanced at the battlefield. He had fought with Jian Wushuang several times, so he was very clear how terrifying Jian Wushuang’s Sword Realm was.

If Jian Wushuang did not perform Sword Realm, Shi Ling could easily get the upper hand, but once the Sword Realm was displayed, he immediately lost ground.

Shi Ling knew that what tortured him the most was the feeling of being suppressed in the Sword Realm.

He had great strength, but could not show all of it.

“I quit!”

After a while, Yun He conceded.

Soon he and Jian Wushuang came back.

“Swordsman, your Sword Realm suppressed me so much.” Yun He sighed.

Jian Wushuang wore a smile. He often sparred and drank with these commanders, so they were familiar with each other.

These commanders were powerful indeed. If he did not show his trump card, Jian Wushuang could not defeat any of them and could only have the upper hand at most. Therefore, Jian Wushuang gained a lot from his fights with them over the month.

“Come on, let’s have a drink.” Lei Dao raised a wine cup.

Jian Wushuang was about to take it. Suddenly...

Buzz... Invisible waves spread out.

It shook so heavily that all the people in Demon Heart Canyon perceived it.

“This is?” Their expressions changed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and other commanders appeared in the sky and looked at the bottom of the canyon. They saw a stream of cyan energy flowing out. Though it was powerful, the cyan energy seemed on the edge of collapse.

“The cyan energy comes from the Formation outside the cave mansion?” Jian Wushuang thought.

Whoosh!

A figure appeared beside them.

“General Qing.” They all noticed and cried out.

“The Formation is going to dissipate.” General Qing sighed and then gave an order. “Go tell our lord!”
