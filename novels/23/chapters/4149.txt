4150 Showing His Face

It had to be said that among the team sent by the Divine Life Palace, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’ status was only second to the Ninth Kalpa King’s. He was indeed quite capable.

As the Ruler Violet Eye and the other two were panicking, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’s face darkened and he shouted again, “Ninth Kalpa King, you and I are both from the Divine Life Palace, and you are the leader of this team. If I die here, do you think Supreme Blood Wave and the others won’t blame you?”

After he finished speaking, a part of the void suddenly distorted and Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves was elated as he quickly looked at the void.

With Ninth Kalpa King in the lead, Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng behind him, the three of them formed a triangle and stepped out of the void. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ninth Kalpa King, you’re really here!” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves was overjoyed when he saw this. The eyes of the Ruler Violet Eye and the Ruler Nine Yang also shone with intense joy.

However, before the four of them could speak again, the Ninth Kalpa King’s words made their hearts turn cold, as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

“I really don’t care about trash like you. If it weren’t for the higher-ups of the Divine Life Palace, I wouldn’t have cared about your lives.” The Ninth Kalpa King’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

In fact, he, Jian Wushuang, and the other two did not want to show up so early, because he knew that once he showed up, he would be the target of public criticism. After all, his strength was there.

The best choice was to hide in the dark and wait for the best opportunity to attack. However, they had no choice but to show themselves because of Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three.

It could not be helped. No matter how much they disliked the four people and how angry they were, they were from the Divine Life Palace after all. Although the Ninth Kalpa King was willing to watch the four people die, he had to consider the blame from the higher-ups of the Divine Life Palace.

The three of them had no choice but to reveal themselves in advance.

After the Ninth Kalpa King glanced at the four of them, his gaze fell on the blood-red divine flower that bloomed on the cliff in the Nanyang Canyon. He said, “As long as the four of them don’t die, I don’t care about anything else. But I want that godly medicine.”

The Ninth Kalpa King is indeed the Ninth Kalpa King. “We have not seen each other for 3000 years, but he’s still so overbearing. He actually asked for the Supreme divine flower the moment he appeared.” The Silver Roc at the entrance of Fengyang Canyon said with a fake smile.

“Oh? You’re not convinced?” The Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes turned to look at the Silver Roc, and his eyes were cold.

“Hmph, Ninth Kalpa King, I will settle the score with you sooner or later for the enmity from three million years ago. But what I want to tell you now is that you can’t be presumptuous in this place!” The Silver Roc’s expression was uncertain.

“You talk too much.” Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King sneered in disdain.

Then, he lowered his head and looked at the other Rulers in the Fengyang Canyon. He said coldly, “I want this godly medicine. Who wants to stop me?”

“Or should I say…who dares to stop me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire place fell silent.

Everyone who was caught by the Ninth Kalpa King’s gaze avoided his eyes and lowered their heads in silence.

The Ninth Kalpa King alone had actually suppressed the entire scene into silence!

“This is strength.” Even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration when he saw this.

The Ninth Kalpa King’s reputation in the universe was too great. As an Ultimate Ruler, no matter if it was an ordinary Ultimate Ruler, a top Ultimate Ruler, or even some of the almost invincible existences among the Ultimate Rulers, they would be a little afraid of the Ninth Kalpa King.

Jian Wushuang was far from being able to compare with such power.

“Pa! Pa! Pa!”

At this moment, a lazy clapping sound came from the crowd in Fengyang Canyon.

Ninth Kalpa King, I’ve long heard of your great name.

A barefoot young man wearing a red robe with his hair tied into pigtails walked out of the void with an evil smile on his face.

Behind him was a team of peak Ultimate Rulers in armor. They followed closely behind him, exuding a murderous aura.

“The people from the Great Sun Divine Kingdom!”

“Those are the divine armor guards of the Great Sun Divine Kingdom. Every single one of them has the power of a peak-Level Ultimate Ruler!”

“That red-robed youth from the great sun must be the Ruler sent by the Great Sun Divine Kingdom!” Zhao Feng muttered.

“I’ve heard that he’s always been unruly, bloodthirsty, and belittling others. He’s hated by countless people in the Great Sun Divine Kingdom, but he’s also extremely powerful. He did not expect…he actually came to the ruins of the zenith!”

“With this person around, I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult for the Ninth Kalpa King to get the divine medicine smoothly.”

“Ah, no matter who obtained this godly medicine, looking at the current situation, we have no hope.”

The pupils of the various Ultimate Rulers, who had been silent with their heads lowered, shrank when they saw this. They then sighed.

In the outside world, these Ultimate Rulers were the best among the Ultimate Rulers. However, in the starry ruins, where all the geniuses were gathered, they were not enough.

“Eh? You want to stop me?” The Ninth Kalpa King looked at him, his indifferent face extremely cold.

“It’s just a divine herb that can increase the chances of breaking through to the Supreme-being realm. It’s not a great opportunity in these ruins. It’s not like we don’t have it in our Great Sun Divine Kingdom. I’m not very interested in it.” The red-robed young man shook his head. In the next moment, his lips curled into a bloodthirsty smile as he changed the topic, “However, I’ve long heard of your name, Ninth Kalpa King. It’s said that you are a rare perfect life form in the universe. Many people say that you are the number one Ruler of this era in the vast universe. I’m quite interested in this.”

Hualala.

The void twisted again, and five figures wearing long blood-red robes, hoods, and long sickles walked out of the void.

The faces of the five people could not be seen clearly as the wide hoods covered more than half of their faces.

They exuded a strong aura of death, and the long, sharp, and curved sickles in their hands made them look like emissaries from the netherworld rather than living people.

“They’re from the Blood Sky Palace!”

“This is…the five blood messengers of the Blood Sky Palace!”

“This is…the crowd cried out in alarm.” They naturally understood these famous peak-level experts.

“This divine herb is for the Blood Sky Palace.”

“Whoever blocks it will die.”

The five blood nether emissaries spoke at the same time. Their voices were hoarse, like the sound of iron pieces grinding together, and it was hard to tell if they were male or female.

The crowd fell silent again when the five blood nether emissaries from Blood Sky Palace appeared.

“Whoever blocks it will die.”

No one doubted their words. Blood Sky Palace was notorious in the vast universe. Countless Rulers and Supremes had died at their hands. Even some top-tier Supremes were extremely afraid of Blood Sky Palace.

Although these five blood underworld envoys only had the strength of a peak Ultimate Ruler, they might not be comparable to an invincible Ruler like the Ninth Kalpa King. However, when they joined forces, even the Ninth Kalpa King would have to pay some attention to them.
