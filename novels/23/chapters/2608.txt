Chapter 2609: Senior Meng

“Senior Meng, to what do we owe this honor?” The supervisor of Star Picking Pavilion respectfully asked.

“I’m here for the Stately Painting,” said the white-haired old man slowly.

“The Stately Painting? Didn’t Headquarters pass the Stately Painting to us for auction?” The purple-robed man frowned.

The white-haired old man, Senior Meng lightly spoke, “It’s true, but the Stately Painting is different from other treasures. I’ve investigated it with those from the Headquarters and all of us reached the same conclusion—the Stately Painting is a treasure that completely surpassed all levels of Heavenly Treasure which is to say it’s at least a Holy Treasure. Moreover, it’s absolutely not an ordinary Holy Treasure!!”

“What?”

The faces of the Purple Supervisor and his two Golden Chiefs turned pale from shock.

Surpassing the levels of a Heavenly Treasure?

A Holy Treasure?

Even among Undying Saints, there were only an extremely few who had exceptionally strong abilities or heaven-defying luck for them to own one or two Holy Treasures!

The completely shocked Purple Supervisor asked, “Senior Meng, why did the Headquarters let us sell it since it’s a Holy Treasure?”

He only complied with the order from the Headquarters in asking them to put the Stately Painting up for auction. However, the Star Picking Pavilion’s Headquarters never told them the treasure’s actual level.

Only when they heard it from Senior Meng were they shocked.

That was a Holy Treasure. What was it doing in an auction like that? Furthermore, those who were fighting over the item were only a bunch of Earthly Ultimate Gods and Heavenly Ultimate Gods!

Senior Meng indifferently said, “This matter is out of the ordinary. After we have appraised the Stately Painting as a very powerful and unique Holy Treasure, we spent a fortune to hire someone very important in helping us to make the Stately Painting recognize a master. That person has also agreed to help. However, he found that the Stately Painting has somehow already established a hidden connection with someone in the end. It’s evident the Stately Painting is an owned item for it to possess that kind of connection!”

“An owned item?” The Purple Supervisor was startled.

“The treasure isn’t something we can cultivate and absorb easily since it already has an owner. According to its history, it was coincidentally taken out of a void. We could then determine the Stately Painting has lost its master due to a certain reason. It’s exactly because of that, we dare not even keep this treasure in the Star Picking Pavilion any longer.

“This treasure is of an extremely high level after all. Its master who could cultivate, absorb, and control it must be someone who has extraordinary abilities. He’s most probably a Peak Undying Saint who possesses extremely terrifying abilities. He could also be an existence like Sword Lord Tong Xin who stood above other Undying Saints. He could even be someone who has surpassed those saints—a titanic figure who enjoys a huge reputation in the entire Ancient God Domain.

“A super expert like that isn’t someone who should be crossed, even for Star Picking Pavilion. If the Stately Painting continues to stay in the Star Picking Pavilion, we can’t guarantee the powerhouse won’t show up at our door one day by tracing the hidden connection. We will be in deep trouble by then.

“Therefore, we have decided to send this Stately Painting back to Danyang Holy Domain where it was first discovered after our discussion by selling the item in the holy domain’s biggest auction. The news will spread once the treasure is sold. If its owner is currently in Danyang Holy Domain, he will naturally look for it after hearing the news and ask for the item to be returned to him. Even if he isn’t in Danyang Holy Domain, the treasure won’t have much to do with our Star Picking Pavilion as he won’t find it with us if its master comes to our doorsteps,” spoke Senior Meng calmly.

“Is that so?”

The Purple Supervisor and his two Golden Chiefs took a nervous breath while listening to him.

They began to feel pity toward those who were still trying to outbid each other over the Stately Painting.

All of them thought that the Stately Painting was an extremely high-level treasure which was indeed true.

However, the Stately Painting was also a dangerous item that nobody should touch at the same time. If someone obtained it, he might be visited by a certain superior being.

Senior Meng mumbled, “The reason I personally came today is to see who will obtain the Stately Painting in the end. After that, I shall follow that person so that I can perhaps meet the superior being.”

The Purple Supervisor and his two Golden Chiefs dared not dare say more.

...

In the auction, the bidding price of the Stately Painting had gone up to 1,180,000,000 and it was still going up.

However, there were only two people left who were still bidding.

The two of them were Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master and the beautiful lady from Dongfang Clan.

“One billion and two hundred million Primordial Stones!”

The beautiful lady from Dongfang Clan bid again as her cold voice resonated in the auction house at the same time. “Young Palace Master, it’s just a unique treasure. Although its level is most probably high, it doesn’t easily recognize a master. Do you really want to keep competing against me? If the next two treasures are even better than this Stately Painting, will you have enough capital to bid for those?”

“Haha! I don’t need you to worry about whether I have enough capital to bid for the next two items. Truth be told, I recently visited an extraordinary ruin and discovered quite a bit of resource before coming here. Even though they aren’t worth a lot, they are still worth nearly two billion. Even if the Stately Painting still doesn’t recognize a master after I obtained it, I could just treat it as a wasted trip to the ruins.” The Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace laughed heartily.

“One billion and three hundred million!!”

The beautiful lady’s face turned gloomy after she heard what he said.

The Dongfang Clan had a deep financial foundation and their wealth truly spoke louder than words. The beautiful lady happened to be one of the people who had control over the clan’s properties, hence the amount she could control was extremely large.

Though however large, it was still unwise to spend more than 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones to purchase a unique treasure that contained certain risks.

1,300,000,000 Primordial Stones was her limit.

“Forget it, I shall fulfill your desire since you crave the Stately Painting so much,” said the beautiful lady before falling silent who had apparently given up on competing.

“Haha, thank you!” Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master laughed.

Finally, the Stately Painting fell into his hands with a final bidding price of 1,300,000,000 Primordial Stones.
