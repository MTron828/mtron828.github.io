Chapter 2704: The Attack

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’ve reached the Heaven Ultimate God realm!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes while in a state of ecstasy.

The gap between Earth Ultimate God and Heaven Ultimate God was too huge.

He was able to challenge those of a higher realm because he was a Perfect Chaotic Creature. It was almost impossible for an ordinary Earth Ultimate God cultivator to fight against a Heaven Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough from Peak Earth Ultimate God realm to Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God realm with his divine power undergoing some qualitative changes. His overall strength as well as other great secret techniques he cultivated had also instantly elevated to a whole new level with great improvements.

He had achieved the Seven Stars Secret Technique’s second volume and he could not improve further on that.

However, other techniques like the Divine God of Punishment, Primordial Void Celestial Body, and even the Nine Sparkle Star Armor had improved.

Jian Wushuang contained the surprise and happiness in him as he remained in the secret chamber to carry on sharpening his skills and secret techniques.

Time continued to pass by... Another three months had passed by in a flash.

In a secret chamber enshrouded by a large number of restrictive shields at the Star Fort. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A middle-aged man with neat and black short hair sat cross-legged. There was a special star-shaped mark between his eyebrows which gave away an intimidating feel. The middle-aged man opened his eyes as the pupils in his deep eyes were seemingly doused in elation.

“It’s done, it’s finally done!”

“Haha, how many years has it been? My level of law perception has stayed at this level for many years and I haven’t been able to achieve a breakthrough. I even thought I’ll be stuck in this bottleneck for the rest of my life, but I’ve finally broken through this bottleneck.”

The middle-aged man laughed as his voice echoed throughout the secret chamber.

His hand gripped tightly onto an old scroll.

“I did it because of this!”

“It’s indeed a prized treasure from that place. I have only gotten it for twenty years and it has helped me made a breakthrough in my law understanding bottleneck. I might even improve in my understanding of principles if I continue using this in meditation and there might be a chance for me to achieve a breakthrough in my cultivation realm.”

The middle-aged man had his eyes riveted on the scroll.

His mood soon calmed down.

“I have broken through the bottleneck in law perception and improved on my strength. It’s now time for me to seek revenge from the Sword Alliance!” The middle-aged man’s eyes turned cold as he immediately left the secret chamber.

Many high-level experts from Star Fort gathered before him not long after he left the secret chamber.

“Our pleasure to meet the Fort Master!”

“Welcome back.”

Gu Mo and the remaining Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods from Star Fort respectfully paid obeisance.

The middle-aged man was the Star Fort Master called Fo Yi.

Fo Yi had a similar name to Fo Wu who was killed by Jian Wushuang. It was obvious those two had an unusually close relationship.

It was indeed the truth.

Fo Yi and Fo Wu were originally from the same organization. They were experts the organization cultivated since young with their names were also given by that organization. However, the organization later encountered a powerful enemy and was destroyed. Fo Yi and Fo Wu managed to escape before joining forces and began to work together—gradually showing their talent in the Danyang Continent.

The two had jointly created the Star Fort.

Fo Yi was the Star Fort Master while Fo Wu handled all the operations within Star Fort.

The two were like brothers who went through thick and thin.

Fo Yi naturally would not let the matter rest after his brother was killed.

“Deliver my commands. Summon all the experts to come with me and wipe out the Sword Alliance!” Fo Yi ordered.

The Star Fort experts were very excited to hear that.

Soon, Fo Yi personally led all the Star Fort high-level experts and headed straight for the Sword Alliance.

Sword Alliance... In nearly two years, Corpse Palace, Divine Dragon Pavilion, and Purple Dress House had been completely assimilated into the Sword Alliance.

The Sword Alliance’s strength had also greatly improved.

The Divine Sword Official Army had also expanded from 50 soldiers to 100 soldiers with their combat power greatly increased.

In addition, there were three great combat leaders at the highest level—Jian Wushuang, Sheng Long, and Purple Dress House Master. Sword Alliance since then became a second-rated force and was recognized by all the other forces as a powerful second-rated force.

The Sword Alliance had developed rapidly.

However, today...

A large number of Star Fort experts went all the way to Dragon City and stopped in the void before the huge black castle.

Rumbling!

Their tyrannical aura permeated from the void above Dragon City from every direction.

The black castle was the Sword Alliance’s lair. A large number of Sword Alliance experts also rose instantly into the void after sensing the gush of tyrannical aura.

At the same time, the Divine Sword Official Army that was made up of hundreds of Heaven Ultimate Gods also appeared uniformly in the void up above.

The soldiers in the Divine Sword Official Army were carefully selected. They were extremely powerful among Heaven Ultimate Gods and worked well together with great tacit understanding. They stood together to form a military formation at that moment. Although they stood quietly in lines, their cold eyes were focusing on the Star Fort experts.

“These people look like an army?” Fo Yi also saw the many soldiers from the Divine Sword Official Army and was surprised.

“They’re indeed an army. They’re called the Divine Sword Official Army and were formed in a very short time by the leader at a great cost. According to the information we have, this Divine Sword Official Army currently has a total of a hundred soldiers with all of them at the Heaven Ultimate Gods realm and knowing some military formations. Their combat prowess is particularly strong,” said a red-haired middle-aged person next to Fo Yi.

“A mere second-rated force has formed an Official Army in a very short time. Hehe, they must be really rich and powerful. I don’t know which force is secretly supporting the Sword Alliance.” Fo Yi smiled coldly. “Although I don’t know who it is, today this Divine Sword Official Army is gonna be mine.”

Fo Yi had shown a great deal of interest in the Divine Sword Official Army. After all, even his Star Fort did not have enough resources to form such a high-quality army.

In the void some distance away, the high-level experts from the Sword Alliance had also gathered together.

“There are so many people here. It seems the Star Fort is coming all out this time—thinking to destroy the Sword Alliance.” Dong Xue gazed coldly at those people from the Star Fort.

“The Star Fort experts aren’t terrifying. We’re good enough to fight against those experts and have a great winning chance with the current combat prowess of the Divine Sword Official Army. The only issue is the genuine Grand Ultimate God Star Fort Master has also personally come forward.” Long Shan frowned.

Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master felt a great deal of pressure coming from just Fo Yi alone.
