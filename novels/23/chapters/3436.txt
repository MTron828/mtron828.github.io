Chapter 3441 Piahuo City

After determining the location of his relatives in this life, Jian Wushuang went straight to Piahuo City.

As one of the eight ‘pure lands’ in the demon region, the entire city was huge. There were many experts and human cultivators in the city, and the city was heavily guarded, a large number of city guards were stationed in every corner of the city.

In Piahuo City, the city guards would immediately take action if there was a fierce battle. Apart from stopping the battle, the two people who participated in the fierce battle would also face punishment in their eyes, moreover, this was because the fierce battle did not cause too much commotion.

If the fierce battle was very fierce or if someone killed someone in the city, they would be directly executed.

Because of this, the Piahuo City was relatively safe.

After entering the monster territory, Jian Wushuang rushed to the Piahuo City as fast as he could.

“The Piahuo City is indeed vast. Even with my soul perception, I can’t cover the entire city,” Jian Wushuang thought. He had tried his best to spread out his soul power, but he could only sense a part of the city.

But it was this part that allowed Jian Wushuang to sense a familiar figure.

“It’s really here.” Jian Wushuang smiled and directly rushed toward the figure he sensed.

In the void near the street in Piahuo City, a large number of figures gathered here.

“Chi Hu, this is the floating-fire city. How dare you hurt me here?” A delicate young man in a white robe shouted in a low voice as he was surrounded by people.

Standing in front of this young man was a burly man who was over three meters tall. His skin was completely black and he was wearing battle armor. This burly man was clearly from a special race, his body also emitted an incomparably valiant aura. The burly man parted his mouth and smiled when he heard the words of the delicate-looking young man. “Qiu Yun, you really are like this even though you say that you have not seen the world. It is true that fighting is prohibited in drifting fire city. However, as long as you do not cause too much of a commotion in a normal fight, you will only be punished a little at most. With my status, you can also be exempted from any punishment. In other words, as long as I do not kill you, I will be fine no matter what I do to

you.”

“Men, break both of his legs!”

“Yes.”

Two rank seven True Saints immediately attacked from behind the burly man. The white-robed young man had just reached the level of an Immortal Saint, so he naturally did not have any ability to resist the two rank seven True Saints. In just an instant...the white-robed young man’s legs were broken.

“Bastard!”

The white-robed young man clenched his hands tightly. His body was being pressed to the ground by the two rank seven True Saints. He could not even raise his head. He could only roar and curse.

But the more he struggled, the happier the burly man became.

“Haha, I told you not to give me face before. You think that I can’t do anything to you in Piahuo City? What a joke. Come on, chop off his arms as well.”The burly man ordered.

To an Immortal Saint, breaking his arms and legs was nothing. He could recover very easily. However, in his heart, this was a blatant humiliation to the white-robed young man. In front of everyone...he was wantonly trampling on his dignity. When the two rank seven True Saints heard the burly man’s order, they immediately planned to chop off the white-robed young man’s arms.

But right at this moment...

“Stop!”

A low shout suddenly rang out, and then a large number of figures charged over from the void beside them.

When they saw the people who had arrived, a commotion immediately appeared in the surrounding void.

“Quick, get out of the way! The city protection army is here!”

“Fighting is forbidden in fluttering fire city. Now that the city protection army is here, there will be a good show to watch.”

“Not necessarily. That Scarlet Tiger is the young grandmaster of the Scarlet Gold Clan. His status is obvious. Moreover, he did not cause any deaths. Even the city protection army would not dare to do anything to him.”

Many people were whispering in secret.

In the blink of an eye, the city protection army had arrived in front of the crowd.

“Release him!” One of the captain-level saints immediately reprimanded.

However, the two rank seven True Saints who had pinned the white-robed youth to the ground did not react at all. They looked toward Chi Hu. Chi Hu smiled sinisterly and waved his hand, indicating for the two of them to let go.

“Yun ‘er.”

An azure-robed woman rushed out from the crowd and hurriedly picked up the white-robed youth.

“Mother.” The white-robed youth forced out a smile when he saw the woman.

“Bastard!” The green-clothed woman clenched her teeth in anger when she saw the miserable appearance of her son.

The commander of the City Protection Army by the side also frowned, he said, “Chi Hu, although you are the young chief of the Scarlet Gold Clan, this is after all floating fire city. Aren’t you treating the city protection army and the many tribes in the demon region too disrespectfully by acting in such a manner?”

“Haha, I merely taught an ignorant person a lesson. Moreover, I did not cause any deaths. Why, do you City Protection Army plan to settle scores with my Scarlet Gold Clan over this matter?” The burly man, Chi Hu, laughed fearlessly.

The expression of this city protection army captain changed.

The city protection army of Piahuo City and the City Protection Army of the other seven cities were actually supported by the top tribes in the demon region. Their existence was indeed to maintain order within these eight cities. Usually...the principles in these cities were extremely strict.

However, if the matter involved some top races...

For example, although the current Scarlet Gold race was not one of the four great celestial races, their strength was only second to the four great celestial races. Such a powerful race and the other party was the young grandmaster...therefore, the city protection army had to have some scruples. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Under normal circumstances, as long as a person like Scarlet Tiger did not go overboard in the city and killed people on the streets, the City Protection Army would turn a blind eye.

This was how it was today. “Scarlet Tiger, you have already taught him a lesson. Today’s matter ends here. If you attack this person again in Piahuo City, our City Protection Army can no longer pretend that we did not see it,” said the City Protection Army’s captain.

“Haha, that’s fine. For such a small character, teaching him a lesson once is enough. I have no interest in teaching him a lesson a second time.” Chi Hu smiled coldly, then turned around. “Let’s go.”

After saying that, Chi Hu and his subordinates planned to leave. The City Protection Army did not dare to stop them.

But at this moment...sou! Sou! Sou!

Three figures suddenly blocked Chi Hu and the others.

“Wanting to leave after teaching them a lesson, leaving nothing behind. Aren’t you being a little too relaxed?”

A cold voice suddenly reverberated in the air.
