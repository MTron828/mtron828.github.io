Chapter 2443: Highly-Priced Bounty

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Junior Brother Pang Tao died?” Long Zishan was in disbelief.

“What?” The Great Compassion Sect disciples around him were also dumbfounded.

“How’s that possible? How could Senior Brother Pang Tao get killed in Saint’s Tomb?”

“Senior Brother Pang Tao had a Safety Token! Who was so skillful that Senior Brother Pang Tao couldn’t even take out his Safety Token?”

Shouts rose one by one. The Great Compassion Sect disciples were overwhelmed by surprise and even more fury.

“It’s him, Jian Wushuang?” Long Zishan squinted. The image of a weak-looking young man with only a Chaotic Realm cultivation level had appeared in his mind.

Naturally, Long Zishan did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang and Pang Tao unexpectedly died in his hands.

“I’m to be blamed, I shouldn’t have let Junior Brother Pang Tao go to that area.”

Long Zishan’s face wore a sense of regret and stood up the next moment. “Elder Hanyun has an order. He wants us to do everything we can to kill Jian Wushuang and avenging Junior Brother Pang Tao. Let’s go, let’s first regroup with Junior Sister Aoqing before looking for Jian Wushuang.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Zishan and the rest of the Great Compassion Sect disciples immediately moved out.

Meanwhile, countless different sects’ genius disciples in Saint’s Tomb received the news.

“Good God. A hundred geniuses besieging Jian Wushuang alone had resulted in Jian Wushuang slaughtering more than half of them. Even Pang Tao from the Great Compassion Sect died in his hand?!”

“Is Jian Wushuang’s ability really that terrifying?”

“I heard that the reason those geniuses attacked Jian Wushuang was that he took a total of three position tokens in one go!”

“My goodness, we’ve been waiting here for so long and didn’t even see one position token, and Jian Wushuang got three of them? No wonder he was attacked.”

After hearing the news, genius disciples from different sects were stunned by Jian Wushuang’s horrifying ability and coveted over those three position tokens that he possessed.

However, an update soon arrived. Two of the three position tokens that Jian Wushuang possessed had been respectively passed to Ancient Star Temple’s Ice Queen and Narcissus Island’s Zhong Yi. Both of them went and hid in the outer area.

This news was deliberately spread by Ancient Star Temple and Narcissus Island.

Their goal was to lighten Jian Wushuang’s burden.

As expected, the genius disciples who were drooling over Jian Wushuang’s position tokens had their greed decreased a great deal after receiving the news.

Such was the norm, as it was a lot less tempting when there was only one position token.

For instance, Long Zishan of the Great Compassion Sect who also had a position token and many knew about it too, but no one really wanted to seek trouble with him.

Those various sects’ genius disciples would rather wait for the last two position tokens’ appearance than confronting Jian Wushuang since his abilities were much more horrifying than Long Zishan’s.

Therefore, quite a bit of pressure on Jian Wushuang had been lifted.

However, none of those sects were willing to let him off easily since he had offended them.

After that news had gotten out, about 20 sects came together and posted a bounty!

The subject was Jian Wushuang, of course!

The reward—10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power, three Pinnacle Ground Treasures, and one Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir pill!

That was only the reward for directly killing Jian Wushuang. Even if he could not be killed, by cornering him into desperation and escaping with a Safety Token, one would also be rewarded with 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power and three Pinnacle Ground Treasures.

It caused a sensation in the entire Saint’s Tomb as word went out.

Nobody would have thought that those sects would come together and post the bounty.

Moreover, it was such a highly-priced bounty!

The rewards were Ancient God Divine Power, Pinnacle Ground Treasures, Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir...

Ancient God Divine Power was not as exclusive as it could restore or upgrade a cultivator’s divine power.

One of the opportunities in Saint’s Tomb, the Divine Power Ocean, was solely built with Ancient God Divine Power.

Furthermore, Divine Power Ocean was personally built by Crimson Stone Saint. It contained an infinite amount of Ancient God Divine Power at the cosmic scale.

In comparison to the entire Divine Power Ocean, 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power were next to nothing.

However, that only applied to super experts who were Undying Saints, such as Crimson Stone Saint. For regular cultivators, 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power was really not a small number.

In the Ancient God Realm, cultivators most commonly bartered with each other using Ancient God Divine Power.

In normal circumstances, a rather wealthy First-Class Divine Demon would own around 1,000 Ancient God Divine Power or even less.

10,000 Ancient God Divine Power was a lot more compared to the possession of many Peak Divine Demons.

That was an enormous wealth to many genius disciples in Saint’s Tomb.

Ground Treasures were mystical weapons!

Even the most regular Ground Treasures were enough to catch the eyes of Third-Class and Second-Class Divine Demons. Pinnacle Ground Treasure could even make First-Class Divine Demons drool.

However, the rewards that those sects offered were a total of three Pinnacle Ground Treasures.

The aforementioned was still a secondary matter, though.

The most precious and rare reward was the latter Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir!

Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir was a priceless treasure to any Divine Demon.

During Jian Wushuang’s past life, when the Old Dragon Master’s dragon mount was killed by Emperor Bai, he used a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir pill as a reward to seek revenge and had received the help of many Divine Demons. In order to obtain that pill, they agreed to his request without any hesitation. From that instance, one could see how important the Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir was.

The elixir could help Divine Demons reach a breakthrough when they arrived at a certain juncture in their cultivation.

For example, a Second-Class Divine Demon’s breakthrough to First-Class Divine Demon or a First-Class Divine Demon’s breakthrough to Peak Divine Demon.

The elixir could play an important role even during a Peak Divine Demon’s breakthrough attempt to Ultimate God.

Therefore, many Divine Demons were naturally excited over it.

The elixir was extremely rare and very difficult to produce. It was a strenuous affair for any Wusha Wilderness sects to even produce one.

Those sects actually took out one Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir as a reward to kill Jian Wushuang and avenge their disciples. That was enough to show that they were going all in to make sure Jian Wushuang had no survival chance.

The results were obvious.

The entire Saint’s Tomb was in a stir as soon as the word had gotten out.

Countless genius disciples from various sects went crazy over the high-priced bounty.

Those who lost interest in Jian Wushuang and no longer had the intention of snatching from him his position token changed their minds after catching the news.

That was understandable as the combined value of 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power, three Pinnacle Ground Treasures, and a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir pill was equivalent to a position token.

Once again, Jian Wushuang became the target for all the geniuses.
