4644 Cangwu Platform

Jade ornaments clanked in her torn clothes, and a slender green lotus whose roots had turned into green jade slowly fell into the bottomless abyss with its master.

Every drop of the divine blood that contained great power fell into the void, like leaves returning to the earth.

Everything was like a bizarre dream, falling into eternal oblivion.

However, in this dream-like darkness filled with unknown dark matter, an extremely pure golden light broke through the chaos.

“Eh? Why are there two people here?” A doubtful yet authoritative voice rang out, and everything returned to silence.

After a long time, the figure who should have died in the hands of Void God, but had somehow survived, slowly opened his eyes.

He only felt that his surroundings were bright and clear, and he could hear the soft sound of a breeze blowing past bamboo.

“Didn’t I die? Is this the reincarnation realm…”

“Could it be that even if a God dies, there will be reincarnation…”

Sitting up slowly from the bamboo bed, Jian Wushuang did not have time to think about any problems before he was interrupted by the sharp pain coming from his body.

“I can still feel pain when I’m dead? Could it be that I’m not dead?” Jian Wushuang murmured softly. He quickly stabilized his heart and carefully checked the meridians in his body.

After checking, he realized that he was not dead!

Other than the broken meridians in his body, even his divine power was slowly going through a cycle of being reborn and destroyed!

“I didn’t die? I actually didn’t die!” The uncontrollable ecstasy made Jian Wushuang forget the pain in his body.

It was not until he had calmed down for a long time that he started to look around the room.

The interior of the room was extremely simple. Every piece of furniture, window decorations, and even the house was made of bamboo. From the degree of roughness, it seemed that the owner had woven it by hand.

Enduring the pain, Jian Wushuang walked out of the room barefooted.

Outside the room, the warm and genial sunlight shone on his face. The two sides of the small room were planted with bamboo gardens.

In front of him was a vast plain.

Looking at the Fairyland-like environment in front of him, Jian Wushuang completely let down his guard. It had been tens of thousands of years and he had never enjoyed a moment of relaxation.

However, he only relaxed for a moment before all the questions came back to his mind!

The brutal battlefield of blood and fire, the army of one million Divine Power Universe cultivators, and the heavily injured Old Master were like sharp knives cutting at his body.

He quickly pushed the door open and entered, only then did he let out a slight sigh of relief.

Inside the room, Old Master was lying on the ground. His aura was calm and he had passed the critical period. However, the dark green patterns on his skin had not disappeared.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang sat in front of the bed and extended his hand to transfer the divine power that was circulating in his body into Old Master’s body.

When the divine power entered his body, it was like a clay ox entering the sea. There was no trace of it at all. However, Jian Wushuang seemed to be sitting still and he just continued to transfer divine power into Old Master’s body. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This continued for many years, and the sun in the sky never rose or fell. Everything was the same.

Until a slight fluctuation was emitted from this continent.

Slowly opening his eyes, Jian Wushuang walked out of the bamboo house as if he had realized something.

From the distant horizon, a gap appeared in the space, and countless figures arrived on this continent.

Looking at the familiar figures and divine power, Jian Wushuang could no longer suppress his emotions and he leaped forward.

Supreme Xue Bo, who was covered in blood, was already at the end of his rope in terms of both his divine body and consciousness. Beside him, Ninth Kalpa King’s usual white robe was blood-red. White Ape, Long Yan, Long Chi, Wu Jianxian, Great Void Divine Emperor, and the others were also in the same state.

There was no light in the eyes of the army of cultivators, which numbered less than a million. Only the Qilin clan, which had suffered heavy casualties, had a look of excitement on their faces.

Jian Wushuang, who was only wearing plain clothes, appeared in front of everyone in an instant.

Supreme Xue Bo smiled and said slowly, “Palace Master Wushuang, I’ve come to see you.”

With that, Xue Bo passed out.

Jian Wushuang hurriedly moved his body to support Supreme Xue Bo.

Wu Jianxian widened his eyes and said in disbelief, “Jian Wushuang? You didn’t die?”

Jian Wushuang nodded with a bitter smile. “I’m lucky I didn’t die. Let’s not talk about this. Let’s find a place to settle down.”

At this moment, everyone’s tense nerves were completely relaxed.

He did not die, and everyone firmly believed that there was still a chance in the Divine Power Universe.

The Divine Power Universe army of nearly a million soldiers set up camp on the plain. After all, every inch of space here was filled with pure godly power, and recovering quickly was the most important thing.

It was not until the severely injured cultivators were properly taken care of that Jian Wushuang noticed that not far away, a middle-aged man in a plain golden robe was looking at him with a smile.

Behind the middle-aged man with an extraordinary aura, the only two survivors of the Qilin’s five sons, Lu Ting and Lu Gong, were standing there.

Almost instinctively, Jian Wushuang realized that the middle-aged man was the master of this world.

“Little Friend, your body is indeed extraordinary. You’ve fully recovered in just a few years.” The middle-aged man, together with Lu Ting and Lu Gong, quickly came to Jian Wushuang.

“Many thanks for Fellow Daoist’s life-saving grace. I can not thank you enough,” Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said solemnly.

The middle-aged man laughed heartily. “My name is Lu Ding, the eldest son of the Qilin clan. If you don’t mind, you can also call me Big Brother Lu.”

Looking at Lu Ting and Lu Gong behind the middle-aged man, Jian Wushuang knew that the middle-aged man was telling the truth. Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang cupped his hands again and said with a smile, “Big Brother Lu.”

The middle-aged man named Lu Ding nodded with a smile. “How many years has it been? This is my personal realm, called the Cangwu Platform. It’s finally of some use.”

“Cangwu Platform, where is this?”

“It’s near the shattered Rodu, near the Spring of Chaos,” Lu Ding explained.

Jian Wushuang nodded. When the Rodu Star Field was destroyed, he vaguely felt that there was a strange energy attached to the Spring of Chaos. Now that he thought about it, it must be the Cangwu Platform.

“I don’t know how many eras have passed since I entered this place as a young man. I don’t know anything about what happened outside. I’ve already wasted half of my life,” Lu Ding said, half reminiscing and half sighing.

“If I hadn’t taken that step, I’m afraid the trial of the Divine Power Universe would have been my eternal regret.”

At this point, a bright light flickered in Lu Ding’s eyes. A sharp aura, which had experienced the vicissitudes of life, emerged.

Jian Wushuang, who was about to comfort Lu Ding, was shocked when he felt everything around him.

The kind of existence that was completely beyond the world, yet controlled the laws of all things, and created laws with every breath. Lu Ding was a cultivator at the Ancestor realm!
