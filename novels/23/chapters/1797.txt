Chapter 1798: Dao Yuanzi!

Looking at the evil-looking elderly in Taoist robe, Jian Wushuang’s murderous intention increased to its maximum.

Dao Yuanzi… This was a name that Jian Wushuang would never forget in his life.

A long time ago, there was a war during the contest of son-in-law to marry Leng Rushuang.

Back then, Emperor Leng who had controlled Tang of the East, his greatest trump card was the teacher of the state, Dao Yuanzi.

The war had involved many people and even King Gu Tong came forth personally. In the end, Dao Yuanzi had revealed his bucktooth and exposed his intention to refine all living things in Tang of the East in order to recover his power and made Tang of the East fall into an impasse.

In the end, Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate to absorb the blood essence of King Luo Zhen ahead of time and had exploded a terrifying power to make use of River Mountain Map. Then, he had managed to make a drastic change in the situation.

During the battle, Dao Yuanzi should have been killed by Jian Wushuang.

However, Dao Yuanzi was standing before him now and his power had reached a brand new level.

Just like the thirteen Blood Devils, the weakest was an Eternal Real God and even a few Chaotic Real Gods. They were forcefully leveled up by Dao Yuanzi with great measures.

Dao Yuanzi could make thirteen Real Gods so casually and his power… Even Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to belittle his power.

“Hehe, Jian Wushuang, it has been so many years since we last met,” the evil-looking elderly in Taoist robe, Dao Yuanzi, looked at Jian Wushuang with a malicious smile.

“You should have been killed by me back then,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold.

“Killed? Hehe, you only killed a Blood Devil clone that I substantiated,” Dao Yuanzi sneered.

“Blood Devil clone?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Humph, speaking of Blood Devil clone…” Dao Yuanzi’s voice suddenly became cold, “I was trapped in the battlefield nearby and my power was at its weakest. I couldn’t recover with my effort alone so I spent many years to accumulate and finally substantiated a Blood Devil clone that could roam around freely. Although the Blood Devil clone was weaker, as long as I set up a formation and absorbed massive life force, my original body’s power could be recovered very quickly.”

“At first, everything was going according to my plan, even the Life-devouring Formation was already set up. But who would have known that I’d run into you…”

“You exterminated my Blood Devil clone and all my effort and accumulation over the years was in vain. Jian Wushuang, I really hated you to the bone back then. I was dying to slaughter you!!!”

Then, Dao Yuanzi’s gaze let out boundless murderous intention but it quickly dispersed.

“Luckily, God was good to me!”

“Not long after my Blood Devil clone was exterminated, the spiritual energy of the battlefield gradually increased and became more intense. With such spiritual energy, my recovery rate naturally increased tremendously. In no time, my original body finally could leave the battlefield.”

“Haha, as long as my original body is not restricted, isn’t it easy to recover my power?”

“As for what happened next, you should pretty much know,” Dao Yuanzi smiled.

Jian Wushuang knew.

Next, Dao Yuanzi had naturally come to Green Fire World and controlled the thirteen Blood Devils to plunder a large amount of resources. Relying on the resources and the formations that gather souls, Dao Yuanzi had been trying to recover his power until Jian Wushuang came.

“You have been trapped in the battlefield and never recovered your power over so many years… If so, you should be an ancient expert that was left in the battlefield at the border of Green Fire World?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ancient expert? Hehe, you could say so,” Dao Yuanzi admitted.

Jian Wushuang nodded when he heard his reply.

If so, everything made sense.

Green Fire World was sealed off from the outside world. It was almost impossible for any ordinary people wanted to come in with normal method and not be noticed by experts from Green Fire Palace.

In Jian Wushuang’s knowledge, there were two that didn’t belong to Green Fire World but Green Fire Palace didn’t know.

One was King Gu Tong.

Second was Dao Yuanzi.

King Gu Tong came to the battlefield via a gap in Ancient Mystery Land. Jian Wushuang had already found out about that.

As for Dao Yuanzi, Jian Wushuang had been curious until then, he finally found out that… Dao Yuanzi had turned out to be an ancient expert!

He wasn’t from Eternal Chaotic World but from the surrounding vast, ancient battlefield.

Of course, besides Dao Yuanzi, Green Fire World had many other secrets, such as the existence of his master.

On top of that, there was Star Foggy Sea!!!

Star Foggy Sea had been created by the Master of Star Palace but it had appeared in Green Fire World?

And King of Venomous Worms…

Jian Wushuang had once asked King of Venomous Worms about how he had come to Green Fire World but King of Venomous Worms’ reply was that he had come along with Star Foggy Sea.

There was definitely a unique relationship between them.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Dao Yuanzi looked at Jian Wushuang, “I never expected that your power would increase to such a level within fifty thousand years. Even the thirteen Blood Devils that I created, you could kill them so easily. It’s a pity that you came back too late.”

“Too late?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Hehe, if you had returned earlier, like a thousand years earlier, I might have been fearful when I saw you. But now…” Dao Yuanzi chuckled maliciously. Just as he stopped chuckling, rumble. The originally extremely fierce aura instantly increased once again.

The speed of increment was terrifying fast. It immediately exceeded the range of the thirteen Blood Devils and reached another level.

And it continued to rise.

Jian Wushuang focused his gaze. In his perception, Dao Yuanzi’s aura had reached the top of Chaotic Real God and constantly rose to the extreme limit of a Chaotic Real God and he broke through the barrier in the end and had reached the level of an Almighty.

Dao Yuanzi’s aura had only slowed down at this stage.

“Sir God?” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

Dao Yuanzi’s aura had already escalated to the level of an Almighty, to the level of Sir God. However, if he was merely at the level of a Sir God, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be worried.

“It’s a pity. Although Green Fire World’s spiritual energy has reached a certain level, it only started to change not long ago and there wasn’t a Natural Treasure. Without the assistance of Natural Treasure, my power could only recover to this level for now. However, it should be sufficient to kill you.”

Dao Yuanzi smiled faintly. He was confident in himself.
