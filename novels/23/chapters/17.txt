Chapter 18: The Breakthrough

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

From the bottom of the pond, Jian Wushuang stood up slowly. All his muscles and joints crackled as he rose. He stretched and took a great leap to the entrance of the cave.

Jian Wushuang looked at the wall of the mountain ahead of him with his sparkling eyes. A sudden clenching of his right hand made an explosive force burst out instantly from the mountain.

BANG!

The tremendous sound echoed through the cave. Jian Wushuang looked at the large hole in the wall in front of him. His eyes were bright.

“Not only did I reach the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path, I reached the Peak! ” Clenching his fists in excitement, he could feel the surging power contained in his hands.

Jian Wushuang had spent 20 days cultivating in this cave, absorbing every drop of Primordial Spiritual Liquid from the pond.

It had contained a huge quantity of pure Spiritual Power, which he had absorbed completely and transformed into Spiritual Power. As a result, his strength had improved to an amazing state.

Not long ago he had been at the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path, close to the Peak. But today, a series of breakthroughs had brought him to the Seventh Heaven of Divine Path, then the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path. He had skyrocketed to the peak of the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path.

It was an explosive breakthrough.

But everything happened in a systematic manner.

After all, not everyone had access to such a vast amount of Primordial Spiritual Liquid to help with his cultivation, let alone Heavenly Creation Skill, Heaven defying cultivation method. His marvelous breakthrough was attributed to the Primordial Spiritual Liquid and the Heavenly Creation Skill. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Eighth Heaven of Divine Path was equivalent to the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm for an ordinary Warrior. One who reached the Peak of the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path had the same power as one at the peak of the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm. So Spiritual Power operated with the strength advantage of Heavenly Creation Skill, could be equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Perhaps it was slightly lower, but not by much.

A stunning light burst out from Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Jian Meng’er, I am gaining on you! ” Jian Wushuang roared.

Jian Meng’er had cultivated to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Although he had not solidified his cultivation, he had his Heaven defying Heavenly Creation Skill, Spiritual Power, and so on.

It meant that compared with Jian Meng’er, he was almost as strong as her.

He had only needed two months to catch up to her.

“Ten days! There are still ten days before the battle. ” With his eyes squinting, Jian Wushuang thought, “I should take my time. I have gained battle strength similar to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and have a great chance of defeating Jian Meng’er in battle. However, I still need to prepare a certain trump card for myself, just in case. ”

Thinking about a trump card, the first thing that came to his mind was the secret skill recorded in Heavenly Creation Skill.

Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!

It was an extremely powerful secret skill that defied the Heavens.

Along with Heavenly Creation Skill, he was deeply impressed with this secret skill. It was impossible to forget.

When Jian Wushuang thought about this secret skill, he was shocked. It was so powerful that he thought it harmed natural harmony. Furthermore, it inflicted damage on the person who exercised it. Nobody was willing to use it unless it was really an emergency.

It did not make sense to use such a secret skill as the trump card.

“Soul-Devouring Secret Skill contains three scrolls. In my present Realm, I can only try the first one, at most. I can’t even consider the second and third one right now. ” With a smile, Jian Wushuang started studying this skill.

It took him a total of five days.

Five days later, Jian Wushuang was in the north rift of Nine-wolves Mountain, sitting cross-legged in a glade.

“Let’s do it. ”

He took a deep breath and started practicing Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.

He spent five days studying. He was able to grasp the first scroll of the skill, but it had taken a considerable amount of time to carry out. He knew well the harm the skill could cause him, so he was very careful when putting it to use. He didn’t dare to be sloppy.

“The secret skill, it devours one’s soul… ”

As he cultivated the secret skill, there was a buzzing sound. It even shocked the Void. Jian Wushuang’s body seemed like a giant black hole, into which there were constant peculiar forces flooding in at an amazing speed.

These forces were so complex and diverse that Jian Wushuang had difficulty identifying them. But he found that with the infusion of these forces, his cultivation was booming.

He had already been at the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path before, but this wild infusion of forces pushed his Cultivation to a higher Level. A single moment was enough to make a breakthrough from the Eighth Heaven.

The Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path!

His power continued to rise even after he reached the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path.

Suddenly, there was a sharp surge of pain in his heart. It became more intense with the rise of his Cultivation.

“Stop it, now. ” Jian Wushuang was clenching his teeth. His face was distorted. Feeling the sharp pain, he stopped the operation promptly.

As soon as the secret skill stopped, his increasing Cultivation ceased. The pain began to weaken. Even so, the spasms in his body did not diminish right away.

Lying on the glade, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes. He was gasping for breath and looked very weak. It was a long time before he opened his eyes.

“Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, it really is a secret skill that devours the soul? ” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help shaking his head.

It really hurt. It was harmful to practice this skill. He had spared some effort, because he didn’t push his Cultivation to its full extent. However, he still felt extreme pain. If he had exercised it to the full degree, it would be more painful.

“The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill really causes a surge in my Cultivation in a short time, but it hurts me even more, ” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

It was one’s Essence, Qi and Spirit, rather than their Spiritual Power, that the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill harmed.

If it only consumed large quantities of Spiritual Power, he would not care at all. Heavenly Creation Skill, after all, helped him to recover Spiritual Power quickly. As for the Essence, Qi and Spirit, however, even Heavenly Creation Skill could make no difference.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and looked up. He wore a weird expression.

“It… It’s… ” Jian Wushuang stared at everything around him in amazement.

He realized the earth within dozens of meters around him had become lifeless.

The Earth, which had been dark green before, was now yellow and full of cracks. The flowers, grass, and trees were withering away. The ground with dozens of meters around him had died in the twinkling of an eye.
