Chapter 548: Soul Fruit

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang sat deep in thought.

“Emperor Fengxiao’s attainments and understandings are extremely useful to me in any case. At the very least, I have a fresh understanding of Dao. Although I cannot readily agree with some of his ideas, everyone has his own Dao just as everyone has his own path in life.”

“I just need to draw one or two lessons from his work. I have to keep doing my own study in order to develop my own Dao based on my own ideas.”

Without thinking further, Jian Wushuang inhaled a deep breath and took out the Soul Fruit.

“Soul Fruit.”

A hint of anticipation appeared in his eyes as he gazed at the purple-golden fruit which gave off an enchanting fragrance.

“According to Emperor Fengxiao, this is tremendously effective at boosting one’s ‘soul’, and a person can only consume one such fruit in a lifetime. I wonder what use it has for my Sword Soul.”

After murmuring to himself, Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and swallowed the Soul Fruit without hesitation.

Upon reaching the stomach, the Soul Fruit transformed into a strange energy and moved toward the Sword Soul in the sea of consciousness.

An incomparably sharp golden Sword Soul had been quietly floating in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness. However, it clearly became excited and began to tremble frantically when the strange energy appeared. It then opened what resembled a large mouth toward the energy.

It took barely a moment for the golden Sword Soul to completely “swallow” the energy.

Jian Wushuang immediately sensed that the golden Sword Soul was changing.

“What a wonderful feeling this is.”

He could feel that his Sword Soul was leveling up at an astonishing speed.

Though it was already very sharp and powerful to start with, its golden radiance became increasingly dazzling yet.

It took a long time before the improvement gradually ceased.

As he looked at the golden Sword Soul in his sea of consciousness, Jian Wushuang could see that it was obviously a size bigger, and also more sharp and dazzling, than before.

Just as some ideas sprang to his mind, the majestic golden Sword Soul Phantom began to rise fiercely behind him.

Boommm... the golden Sword Soul Phantom gave off a haughty, world-belittling, Supreme Sword Essence as it made its appearance. For a while, it seemed to outshine the sun.

There was a drastic change in the height and size of the golden Sword Soul Phantom that just appeared.

Originally only 18 Zhang (211 feet) tall, its height was now an impressive 24 Zhang (282 feet)!

This meant that it was comparable to several large mountains.

In Jian Wushuang’s hand appeared the Triple-kill Sword, which he flung casually toward the void ahead, aided by the majestic Sword Soul Power.

Swish!

The void unexpectedly emitted a violent wind-breaking sound, and instantly, an immaterial Sword Essence Wave swept forth with an extremely powerful momentum. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang’s countenance changed and his eyes revealed a look of pleasant surprise.

“Haha, my Sword Soul has greatly improved and become more powerful indeed.”

It should be remembered that in a month’s time, the life-death duel between Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake was, as its name suggested, a fight he would either win or perish in.

Any improvement to his strength would be extremely important to him, not to mention improvement to his Sword Soul, which had such an obvious effect on his strength.

“Emperor Fengxiao has indeed given me a great gift. I must remember this favor.”He thought to himself.

Having gained a general understanding of Dao and a drastic improvement to his Sword Soul, Jian Wushuang immediately headed toward the Holy Place.

In the Monster-exterminating Pagoda of the Holy Place.

The Monster-exterminating Pagoda was the treasure vault of the Monster-exterminating League. All kinds of countless treasures belonging to the League were stored here, and they were all purchasable so long as one could pay enough Monster Cores.

Jian Wushuang walked up to the counter.

“I need the 7th, 8th, and 9th cultivation levels of the Bone Fusion Technique. Here are the Monster Cores to exchange for them.” Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring.

He had reaped huge earnings from the East Camp’s large war and thus could afford three levels of the technique. However, he could not afford the Monster Cores needed for Level 10.

“Wait a second.” A white-robed elder at the counter went into the inner hall, but stepped out shortly after and handed three Jade Slips to Jian Wushuang.

The higher cultivation levels of the Bone Fusion Technique were more expensively priced. The seventh level and above could only be separately exchanged for, and so each level was accounted for using a Jade Slip.

Jian Wushuang left the Monster-exterminating Pagoda after receiving the three levels. He then found a place to begin cultivating them.

The Bone Fusion Technique was a pure Body Reshaping Technique and was divided into 12 levels. The first couple of levels were easier to cultivate but the later ones became progressively more difficult.

It placed greatest emphasis on the body’s foundation.

Jian Wushuang’s physical strength was unparalleled, while his foundation, forged from the Heavenly Creation Skill, was all the more indestructible. It was easy to cultivate the Bone Fusion Technique from the 1st to the 6th level, such that he ran into practically no problems doing so. As for the 7th, 8th and 9th levels...

Jian Wushuang found that cultivating Level Seven was similarly easy, and he was able to do so quickly without a hitch.

However, he had some difficulty beginning from the 8th level.

It took him two days to complete the cultivation of Level Eight.

Among the 12 levels of the Bone Fusion Technique, every four levels constituted a volume. The 8th level was only a part of the middle volume, whereas the 9th was a part of the lower volume, which once cultivated would cause one’s body to undergo a qualitative metamorphosis, and was more difficult.

Half a month passed.

This was the time it took for Jian Wushuang to cultivate Level Nine of the Bone Fusion Technique.

In an uncared-for mountain forest outside the Holy Place, Jian Wushuang was standing half-naked under the scorching sun. Just then, his right hand clenched forcefully, and an explosive force formed in it. At the same time, his joints began to make a crackling noise.

“Hua!”

With a groan, the fist, which had been gathering strength, smashed directly toward the void ahead.

Boom!

The world shook. The void, having been violently struck, turned into a storm.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glimmered upon witnessing this scene.

“My body strength... is at least four times greater than it was!”

This was the result of cultivating Level Nine of the Bone Fusion Technique.

Not only did the strength of his body increase, but more importantly, its tenacity increased all the more absurdly. Rather than the effectiveness of the Bone Fusion Technique, this could be attributed to a greater extent to the fact that Jian Wushuang’s body foundation was too vigorous.

It should be known that among the many Divine Emperors of the Monster-exterminating League, only three had cultivated Level Nine of the Bone Fusion Technique, whereas most of them had only cultivated up to Level Eight.

Even the Temple Masters of the League mostly remained at Level Nine.

Yet, despite being only a Saint Realm expert, Jian Wushuang had managed to cultivate said Level.

“I’m starting to look forward to the life-death duel with Emperor Golden Snake.” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, within which a hint of battle intent rose.
