Chapter 2194 Victory

The surrounding experts from the Eternal Chaotic World took a sharp breath when they heard what Emperor Bai had said.To them, once you cast soul ignition, you were destined for doom. There was no way to stop it.

However, that man just now had managed to stop Jian Wushuang’s soul ignition and protect a part of his soul. How incredible was that?

Emperor Thirteen looked at Jian Wushuang before tossing the Mountain River Map and a transmission token over.

“This is his transmission token. Additionally, that is my transmission token. After he awakens from his deep slumber, ask him to message me,” Emperor Thirteen said coldly.

Emperor Bai received the two items. Since Jian Wushuang was in a deep slumber, he would safely keep these items first.

“Additionally, this is what I promised.” Emperor Thirteen tossed him a jade bamboo strip.

Emperor Bai caught it and took a glance. His eyes lit up in surprise.

There was a secret skill carved into the jade bamboo strip.

It was the complete version of one of the secret skills he was currently cultivating.

Back at the Lineage of Star, Emperor Thirteen had seen that Emperor Bai was cultivating an incomplete secret skill. He had told Emperor Bai that he would give him the complete version of the secret skill if Emperor Bai could take care of Jian Wushuang for a period of time.

“Thank you!” Emperor Bai thanked Emperor Thirteen.

Emperor Thirteen looked at Emperor Bai indifferently before leaving.

After Emperor Thirteen left, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World surrounded Emperor Bai.

Everyone was looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor.”

“What happened to the Ancient God Emperor?”

People like King Chen Xing, Abysmal Saint Master and Black Dragon Emperor were extremely worried.

This was especially the case for Black Dragon Emperor, as her feelings for Jian Wushuang had never changed.

“Everyone calm down. Jian Wushuang’s soul was wounded and he went into a deep slumber. As long as there are enough treasures, he can recover. It’s just a matter of time.” Emperor Bai said.

Hearing this, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

“Emperor Bai, the master of the Holocaust Sect escaped,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

Emperor Bai raised his eyebrows and looked at the space that she was in.

The beautiful figure which was standing there disappeared.

“Let her go. She should be from the first era. Now that the Three Emperors World’s factions are destroyed, I doubt she can cause any trouble for us,” Emperor Bai said.

“Tian Chen, what are the losses we suffered during this battle?”

“More than half were either severely injured or dead. Seven of our great emperors died in the battle. They are: Purple Moon Emperor, Master Wu, Yan Zun, King Zhan Cang…” Ancestor Tian Chen read out seven names.

These were the seven emperors who had died in this battle.

On top of that, many sir gods and emperor gods had died as well. The total number of lives lost was over two thousand!

Hearing this, the experts present fell silent.

Emperor Bai took a deep breath and said, “They are the heroes of the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“Yes heros!”

“They sacrificed their lives for the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“Without their sacrifice, the Eternal Chaotic World would not be around now.”

The experts around nodded their heads in agreement.

“Even though we suffered heavy losses during this battle, we won…” The Eternal Chaotic World laughed.

Hearing this, the experts who were down were stunned for a moment before they started to smile.

Victory!

They were victorious!

All of the experts from the Three Emperors World were dead.

The Three Emperors World had crumbled and would no longer pose a threat to the Eternal Chaotic World.

The Holocaust Sect and the Acheron Palace had been two threats that lurked in the dark.

Now, these two threats were gone.

“Let’s go. Let us go home.”

Everyone discussed for a moment before they cleaned up the battlefield and left for home. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Eternal Chaotic World

After the final phase of the war erupted, the Eternal Chaotic World was at the edge of destruction.

The countless cultivators and humans that remained within the Eternal Chaotic World were unsteady and worried.

After the army returned, news of the victory spread like wildfire.

Victory!

This war had cost the Eternal Chaotic World dearly, but they had eventually achieved the final victory.

After the news spread, the entire Eternal Chaotic World was celebrating in ecstasy.

Many people who had been worried sick finally heaved a sigh or relief.

Green Fire World, within Wushuang City.

“Wushuang!”

“Brother!”

Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou and many others looked at the weak Jian Wushuang and were worried sick.

The experts who had participated in this war were mainly from the Eternal Chaotic World as Green Fire World only had one almighty, Jian Nantian. He was far too important to the Green Fire World and did not participate in this war.

“Emperor Bai, how is Jian Wushuang?” Wang Yuan asked anxiously.

“His soul fell into deep slumber. He is in a terrible state but his life is not in danger,” Emperor Bai said.

“His soul fell into a deep slumber?” Wang Yuan frowned.

He was the most powerful alchemist in the Green Fire World. His standard was also considered top tier within the Eternal Chaotic World.

He was well versed in this area.

However, only when one’s soul was severely wounded would they fall into a deep slumber.

“Even though his life is not at risk, Jian Wushuang could possibly slumber for the rest of his life if he is not awakened quickly,” Wang Yuan said.

This was the same for many of the experts from the ancient past.

Some of the experts’ souls had been severely wounded back in the ancient past. Many of them had fallen into deep slumber and could not wake.

“No worries. I ordered my men to prepare the necessary materials. I have also called some of the masters information from the Sanctuary Alliance to prepare the TaiYing Soul Resurrection Formation.”

“Green Fire World is abundant in spiritual influence of heaven and earth. It is most suitable to place the TaiYing Soul Resurrection Formation here. As long as Jian Wushuang stays within the formation, his recovery should be speedy,” Emperor Bai said.
