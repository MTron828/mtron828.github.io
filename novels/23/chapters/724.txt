Chapter 725: Level Three

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide while his heart was beating violently. He asked, “Gu Changfeng, does the Star-river Secret Skill consist of more than 11 levels?”

“Yes, it does.”

Gu Changfeng nodded his head and said, “The higher levels of Star-river and the other two Ancient God Secret Skills have higher requirements for the bloodline’s purity and strength, so they are not carved in this temple. Only Gold-armored Ancient Gods are qualified to cultivate them.”

“What? Only Gold-armored Ancient Gods are qualified?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Among the millions of Ancient God clansmen, there were only about a dozen Gold-armored Ancient Gods in each tribe. That was to say, only a few people were qualified to cultivate the other two Ancient God Secret Skills and the higher levels of the Star-river Secret Skill.

“Nevertheless, the 11 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill are sufficient for ordinary clansmen. For example, many One-star Silver-armored Ancient Gods in our tribe can cultivate Level Nine of the Star-river Secret Skill at most,” Gu Changfeng said.

“Level Nine?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

Level Nine of the Star-river Secret Skill could enhance one’s offensive power 27 times.

It was already very amazing.

“That explains the incredible strength of the Ancient God clansmen, in spite of their shallow comprehension in the Dao. Even the weakest One-star copper-armored Ancient God can compete with an advanced Divine Realm expert,”?

Jian Wushuang sighed.

When he was in the outer layer of the Eternal Zone, he had witnessed how the Ancient Gods fought with the human disciples in the Divine Realm.

Those Demon Gods had poor Dao comprehension, but they possessed a terrifying level of strength.

Any copper-armored Ancient God was as strong as or even much stronger than an advanced Divine Realm expert.

Not to mention the fact that those Ancient Gods had just awakened their bloodline and gone to the outer layer to practice their combat skills. They would be comparable to superior Divine Realm experts in no time at all, even if they were just One-star copper-armored Ancient Gods.

That was due to their incredible physical strength, which resulted from their unique talent and, more importantly, the Star-river Secret Skill.

Once their bloodline was awakened, these One-star Ancient Gods could cultivate Level Six or Seven of the Star-river Secret Skill, which would enhance their offensive power 18 or 21 times. With such an advantage in physical strength, they would be completely terrifying at that time!

“Jian Wushuang, your bloodline is very pure, even purer than mine. Since I’ve cultivated up to Level Three, you will definitely be able to as well. But that’s the highest level we can cultivate. We can’t cultivate Level Four or higher until we go through the baptism and awaken our bloodline,” Gu Changfeng said.

“Level Three?” Jian Wushuang nodded to himself.

“All right. You can cultivate by yourself. I’ll wait for you outside,” Gu Changfeng said before walking out of the temple.

After that, Jian Wushuang was left alone in the temple.

Jian Wushuang sat down cross-legged and looked at the stone wall in front of him with a hint of expectation.

“The Human Warriors in the Firmament Territory are extremely eager to cultivate the Star-river Secret Skill, but they have to find ways to get Ancient God Essence Blood before cultivating it. The higher levels require more Ancient God Essence Blood. Can I cultivate the Star-river Secret Skill without the Essence Blood?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He was not completely sure whether he really had the Ancient God bloodline or not.

But now, he could find out by cultivating the Star-river Secret Skill.

As long as he could cultivate one or two levels of the Star-river Secret Skill successfully without absorbing Ancient God Essence Blood, it would mean that he really did possess the Ancient God bloodline and could definitely transform into an Ancient God after experiencing the Ancient God baptism.

If he failed, it meant that he just had a similar Spiritual aura to the Ancient Gods instead of possessing the Ancient God’s bloodline.

“Let me start.”

Jian Wushuang started to cultivate Level One on the stone wall without making too much preparation.

It was comparably the easiest one, so Jian Wushuang started cultivating it.

However, he discovered that he had succeeded in cultivating it on the first try.

“Did I succeed?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

As he had succeeded without absorbing the Ancient God Essence Blood, it meant that he really did have the Ancient God’s bloodline.

He began to practice Level Two without pause.

The Star-river Secret Skill was closely related to the Ancient God bloodline, so the purer the purer his bloodline was, the easier it would be for him to cultivate it.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang possessed a very pure Ancient God bloodline, so he cultivated the first three levels of the Star-river Secret Skill in less an hour.

He stood up and activated the Star-river Secret Skill while still inside the temple.

“It’s so strong!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and felt his power increase by nine times. At this moment, his eyes sparkled with excitement.

Because he cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, he had already been comparable to a Divine Realm expert in physical strength. Now that the Star-river Secret Skill had enhanced his physical strength nine times, he was even stronger than an ordinary Divine Realm expert in all aspects, even though he was still just a Skyscraping Realm expert.

“Now, even if I don’t use my Sword Heart, I can compete with those superior Divine Realm experts. If I do use my Sword Heart, very few superior Divine Realm experts can defeat me,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a confident look.

Of course, he was referring to the human superior Divine Realm experts in the Firmament Territory. It would be different when he encountered special clans like the Ancient God Clan. For example, the Gold-armored Ancient God he met in the outer layer of the Eternal Zone.

That One-star Gold-armored Ancient God had easily smashed Long Tao, the genius disciple of the Immortal Dynasty, to death with a single hammer. With such terrifying strength, he was far stronger than superior Divine Realm experts. He was probably comparable to Eternal Realm experts.

However, Jian Wushuang should still be weaker than that Gold-armored Ancient God.

“The Star-river Secret Skill can be cultivated to a higher level.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the stone walls eagerly, but then he shook his head,“Unfortunately, I’m only in the Skyscraping Realm. I can’t cultivate the higher levels until after the baptism, when I transform into an Ancient God.”
