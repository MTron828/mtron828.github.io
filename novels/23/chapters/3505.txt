Chapter 3506: Martial Uncle Chenhuo

“Thank you!”

Skyheart Sword Saint received the jade bottle and thanked him. Then, he took out a few pills and began to swallow them.

After swallowing them, Skyheart Sword Saint’s complexion was obviously much better than before.

Taking a deep breath, Skyheart Sword Saint said in a low voice, “Martial uncle, the one who destroyed our Purple Blood Sect was the Kong Yin Sect. At the same time, there were experts from the Hundred Ghost Sect who helped us.”

“Kong Yin Sect? Hundred Ghost Sect?” The gaze of the Demon Master Chenhuo was cold.

“The Kong Yin Sect is one of the seven major powers that control the Blood Origin Domain. Their overall strength can only be considered average. As for the Hundred Ghost Sect, they can barely be considered an overlord of a region at the Second Heaven. Compared to the Blood Marquis Palace, they are only slightly inferior,” the True Pupil Master explained.

“The Purple Blood Sect is very low-key and does not easily provoke large forces. We have never offended Kong Yin Sect or the Hundred Ghost Sect. However, I don’t know where Kong Yin Sect found out that we have a top-tier supreme treasure, so they are coveting it,” Skyheart Sword Saint said.

“Top-tier Supreme Treasure? Do you have it in the Purple Blood Sect?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, I do. It’s a suppression-type supreme treasure. Senior Brother Lingfeng obtained it by chance when he was exploring a secret realm. It’s indeed very valuable. I didn’t expect that it was this suppression-type supreme treasure that caused the destruction of the Purple Blood Sect!” Skyheart Sword Saint clenched his fists, his face also became ferocious.

“Our Purple Blood Sect is not weak either. Kong Yin Sect alone can not do anything to our Purple Blood Sect. However, Kong Yin Sect secretly found the experts of the Hundred Ghost Sect and made the Hundred Ghost Sect send three Principles Masters to join forces with them. They directly charged into our Purple Blood Sect. Our Purple Blood Sect was no match for them. Senior Brother Qiu Mu and senior brother Lingfeng died on the spot. Many of their elders and disciples were also killed.”

“Originally, the experts of the Kong Yin Sect and the Hundred Ghost Sect planned to kill all the cultivators of the Purple Blood Sect. However, because the Blood Origin Domain needed some slaves who were responsible for extracting blood origin stones, they imprisoned the remaining disciples of the Purple Blood Sect and suppressed their cultivation. Not long after, they were brought to the Blood Origin Domain and began to extract blood origin stones in the dark!”

“I thought that the remaining disciples of our Purple Blood Sect would slowly die in the Blood Origin Domain. I didn’t expect you to still be alive, martial uncle...”

“Senior Brother Chenhuo, you must avenge our Purple Blood Sect, senior Brother Qiu Mu and Senior Brother Lingfeng!” Skyheart Sword Saint shouted mournfully.

He was a descendant of the Purple Star Demon Sect. He knew very well that 200 million years ago, when the Purple Star Demon Sect was still around, the Chenhuo Demon Master was publicly acknowledged as a genius elder. At that time, he was already an extremely powerful Principles Master, and now, so many years had passed, so his strength was definitely even more terrifying.

This could be seen from the fact that he had just killed over a hundred soldiers with a wave of his hand and even killed a Principles Master.

Such a powerful martial uncle gave Skyheart Sword Saint hope of revenge.

“Don’t worry, I will avenge Qiu Mu and Lingfeng.” The eyes of the Demon Master Chenhuo were burning with anger. “Skyheart, gather all the disciples of the Purple Blood Sect.”

“Yes.” Skyheart Sword Saint nodded and immediately went to gather them.

In a short while, all the disciples of the Purple Blood Sect in the Blood Origin Domain had gathered here. At a glance, there were no less than a thousand of them.

Most of these disciples were weaker. The stronger ones had already been killed by the Kong Yin Sect. The reason why they did not kill Skyheart Sword Saint was because the Kong Yin Sect wanted to better control these people, they were just extracting the blood origin stones for them.

These disciples were all gathered here, but all of them had blank expressions on their faces.

They had already learned that someone had come to save them. and the person who had come was the martial uncle of the Skyheart Sword Saint, an extremely ancient and powerful Principles Master.

But they were very unfamiliar with the Demon Master Chenhuo himself. They had never heard the Skyheart Sword Saint or Qiu Mu or the Lingfeng Master mention such a martial uncle before.

At the same time, they also had a trace of doubt in their hearts. could the martial uncle of the Skyheart Sword Saint really save them?

One had to know that the Blood Origin Domain was jointly controlled by the Seven Great Powers, and the seven great powers could basically do whatever they wanted in the Second Heaven. Even some of the extremely powerful sects in the Second Heaven…did not dare to provoke the seven great powers easily.

It was not easy for the seven forces to let them go.

These disciples’ doubtful eyes were also noticed by Demon Master and Jian Wushuang.

“Are they all here?” Demon Master’s face was a little gloomy.

“They are all here.” Skyheart Sword Saint nodded. “There were tens of thousands of disciples under the Purple Blood Sect, but more than half of them were killed and many escaped during the sect-extermination battle. In the end, only about 2,000 people were brought to the Blood Origin Domain by the suppression of their cultivation. However, after more than 500 years, many of these disciples chose to end their lives because they could not bear the life of mining blood origin stones in the dark and the oppression and humiliation of the sergeants.”

“Those who are still alive are those who are more determined and desire to live.”

“It’s been hard on all of you.” Demon Master Chenhuo nodded slightly. “Don’t worry. Since I am here, I will not let you suffer. I will not let any sect or faction bully you.”

These words caused the hearts and bodies of the disciples of the Purple Blood Sect to tremble.

“Honorable master, these people’s cultivation has been suppressed, and their suppression techniques are not weak. Even experts above the Principles Master level can only help them break the suppression one by one to restore their strength,” True Pupil Master said.

“True Pupil Master, I’ll have to trouble you with this.” Jian Wushuang glanced at True Pupil Master.

“Yes.” True Pupil Master nodded without any reluctance.

It was not difficult for Principles Master to come into contact with the suppression techniques of these people one by one. It would only take a little effort and time, but there was no other cost. Of course, True Pupil Master was not reluctant.

“Skyheart, you tell them to wait here and ask True Pupil Master to restore their cultivation one by one. And you, come with me to Kong Yin Sect now,” Demon Master Chenhuo said coldly.

“Now?” Skyheart Sword Saint was stunned for a moment and then revealed an ecstatic expression.

Jian Wushuang instructed again, “True Pupil Master, let’s go to the Kong Yin Sect. As for the disciples of the Purple Blood Sect, I’ll leave them to you. You must ensure their safety.”

“Don’t worry, sir. With me around, no one will be able to hurt them again,” True Pupil Master said with a smile.
