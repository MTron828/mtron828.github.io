Chapter 2993: Peak Level One, Four of Them!

——

On the vast sea surface of the Godless Sea area.

The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island and the remaining few Immortal Saints of Blood Blade Island stood there, their faces extremely unsightly.

“They’re here.”

The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island suddenly raised his head. At the end of the void in front of him, more than ten figures were rushing over.

“Haha, Blood Blade Island Master, from the looks of it, you seem to be in a bit of a sorry state?”

Hearty laughter rang out. The person who had let out this laughter was a burly bald man. This bald man came before the Island Master of the Blood Blade Island. His violent aura was not the slightest bit inferior to that of the peak stage first True Saint.

“Tsk tsk, this is also the first time I’ve seen the Island Master of Blood Blade Island in such a state.” Delicate laughter rang out. The person who spoke was a red-clothed young lady. This red-clothed young lady looked delicate and moving, but her eyes were extremely cold, just like the edge of a blade.

“I’ve received news that your Blood Blade Island has already found the location of that Qin Dong. Moreover, all of you have directly charged over. However, looking at the current situation, I’m afraid that all of you haven’t succeeded. Moreover, you’ve even suffered a small loss.” Another black-robed handsome youth said in a low voice.

The burly bald man, the red-clothed girl, and the black-robed cold youth were all peak rank one True Saints. They were shockingly the rulers of the other three overlords of the Godless Sea area.

“Alright, the three of you, let’s cut the unnecessary nonsense. The reason I called you here is to discuss with you how to kill that Qin Dong,” said the Island Master of Blood Blade Island.

“Blood Blade, as far as I know, that young master of the Qin family doesn’t have many experts with him. He doesn’t even have a True Saint. With the strength of your Blood Blade Island, as long as you find their existence, it should be very easy to kill them, right?”

“How did it become like this?” The burly bald man asked.

“I also thought that it was a must. In the end, I didn’t expect the Qin clan to use such a great method to invite an expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to help.” The Blood Blade Island Master said in a low voice.

“Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The expressions of the burly bald man, the red-robed girl, and the black-robed cold-looking young man all changed.

“Is this expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance very strong?” The red-clothed girl immediately asked.

“But on the surface, he doesn’t look strong. He’s only at the Divine Master level, but he must have hidden his aura. His combat strength is so strong that, to put it bluntly, he’s much stronger than any one of the four of us,” the Island Master of the Blood Blade Island said, “once this expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance makes a move, he directly massacred many experts of our Blood Blade Island with great methods. Let alone Divine Masters, even the Immortal Saint of our Blood Blade Island has no chance to struggle in his hands!”

“In just an instant, more than half of the people of our Blood Blade Island were slaughtered by him. Even the Immortal Saint was killed by eight of them. When he made his move, he only casually swung his sword. That terrifying power still completely crushed me… I estimate that this person’s strength should have already reached the limit of a rank one True Saint, and he should be very close to a rank two True Saint.”

“So powerful?” The bald man, the red-robed girl, and the cold-looking black-robed young man all turned solemn.

“Blood Blade Island Master, if you say it like this, any of us who meet that expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will be slaughtered?” The red-robed girl said seriously.

The four overlords of the Godless Sea area were about the same level of strength.

That expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance could easily slaughter everyone from Blood Blade Island. After killing so many experts from Blood Blade Island, naturally, he could also slaughter the other three overlords.

“It’s like this. That’s why I’ve gathered them together now.” The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island said seriously, “Although that person from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is powerful, he is only one person after all. In a one-on-one fight, none of us is his match. However, if four of us fight one person, he will only be crushed by us.”

“Four against one?”

The burly bald man, the red-clothed girl, and the black-robed cold-looking youth looked at each other in dismay before nodding secretly.

Indeed, according to what the Island Master had said, none of them would be enough for that expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to slaughter them. Thus, they could only join forces from all four sides and join forces completely. However, if the four peak tier one True Saints attacked at the same time unless they encountered a tier two True Saint…otherwise, they would be able to suppress him.

“The three of you, this time, the other faction of the Qin clan has given us quite sufficient rewards. Even if we join forces from all four sides and split the rewards, we will still receive quite a lot of rewards. How about it? Whether we join forces or not, you can decide.” The Blood Blade Island Master said.

“We can join forces.” The burly bald man said.

“I have no objections.” The red-clothed girl nodded.

“In that case, let’s work together.” The cold-looking young man in the black robe agreed.

The four of them reached an agreement. Soon, the experts of the four overlords of the Godless Sea area set off immediately.

…

Jian Wushuang and his group had been flying at high speed in the Godless Sea area. They did not hide their tracks at all.

It was certainly not difficult for the experts of the four overlords to find them.

Soon… Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A large group of experts rushed over from the front and arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and the others in the blink of an eye.

“Oh no!”

“It’s the people of the Blood Blade Island again.”

“Except for the Blood Blade Island, the others… Luo God Island, Monster Snow Island, and Black Wind Island. Oh no, the four overlords of the Godless Sea area are all here!”

Qin Dong’s guards were all stunned.

“How is this possible?”

“How can this be?”

Uncle Lei’s eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with disbelief. “The four overlords of the Godless Sea area usually fight for benefits. They have deep grudges against each other, but why are the four overlords working together today?”

“Benefits. It must be for benefits.” Qin Dong’s expression was also extremely unsightly. “It looks like the people over there have invested a lot of capital and given extremely high rewards. This is why the four overlords can forget about their past grudges and work together to kill me. How ruthless!!”

Looking at the many experts of the four islands in front of them, especially the four peak tier one True Saints standing at the very front, Qin Dong’s guards could not help but feel a sense of despair. Of course, they had not completely lost hope yet, after all, they still had a chance of survival.

This chance of survival was the man in a gray robe and a gray mask standing in front of them.

“Lord Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Uncle Lei also looked at Jian Wushuang. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Now Jian Wushuang was their only hope.

Only Jian Wushuang could let them live.

“Are all the experts of the four overlords gathered?” Jian Wushuang’s face under the mask was extremely cold, and his body emitted an unusually cold and black aura.

His eyes showed no emotion as he glanced at the people in front of him.

He had long guessed that this mission was not so simple, so he was not too surprised by the appearance of these experts.
