Mo Shan and the three-eyed man both sighed in admiration at the might of the six paths of reincarnation secret technique. At the same time, both of them felt a trace of envy in their hearts.

Such a powerful secret technique was something that even the Principles Masters yearned for, but unfortunately, they did not have the opportunity.

The blue-haired woman was the only one who had been staring at the scene with a solemn expression.

“Mo Shan,” the blue-haired woman finally spoke. “You only paid attention to the last secret skill of Heavenly Sword Marquis. Didn’t you notice the many secret skills he used from the beginning?”

“What secret skill?” Mo Shan and the three-eyed man looked over.

“Oh, it’s the huge Golden Emperor Phantom behind him and the dark gold armor on his body.” The green-haired woman pointed at Jian Wushuang in the picture.

Mo Shan and the three-eyed man immediately looked over, but they did not see anything at first.

“The Golden Emperor Phantom and the dark gold armor on his body should be secret skills that he used. These two secret skills have greatly enhanced his divine power, but such secret skills are not rare in the Divine Beginning World, right?” Mo Shan asked.

“This type of secret technique isn’t rare, but the two secret techniques that Heavenly Sword Marquis used are much rarer,” the green-haired woman said.

“What do you mean?” Mo Shan asked.

“Don’t keep us in suspense. Just tell us what you’ve seen,” the three-eyed man urged.

“You two, you’ve both lived for millions of years. You’ve lived for tens of millions of years. Your knowledge is extraordinary. I think you’ve all heard of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect!” The green-haired woman said seriously.

“Seven Star Mysterious Sect?”

Mo Shan and the three-eyed man were shocked.

“The Seven Star Mysterious Sect was once the overlord of the Divine Beginning Realm. It’s the oldest and strongest sect. Of course, the two of us have heard of it,” Mo Shan said.

Although the Seven Star Mysterious Sect had been destroyed for many years and had not been mentioned for many years, as the masters of the rules, they were qualified to know some of the secrets of the Divine Beginning Realm. As for the Seven Star Mysterious Sect...of course, they had heard of it.

“It is said that when the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was at its peak, even the three great saint domains could not compare to it. Only when the three great saint domains joined hands would they have the right to compete with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. Although our Heaven-cleaving Alliance is now the number one Free Alliance in the Divine Beginning Realm, our strength and foundation are extremely powerful. If we were to fight against one great saint domain alone, we could easily gain the upper hand. However, once the two great saint domains join hands, I’m afraid that our heaven-destroying alliance would not be able to defeat them. If the three great saint domains join hands, even our Heaven-cleaving Alliance would have no choice but to retreat!”

“At its peak, the Seven Star Mysterious Sect could contend against the three great saint domains at the same time!” The three-eyed man’s voice was a little agitated.

They had all heard some legends about the Seven Star Mysterious Sect.

They were also filled with yearning for such an ancient and powerful super sect.

“But unfortunately, this sect was destroyed many years ago.” The three-eyed man sighed softly.

“Biyun, we are talking about the Heavenly Sword Marquis. Why are you talking about the Seven Star Mysterious Sect? Could it be that this little guy has something to do with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect?” Mo Shan looked at the green-haired woman.

“I don’t know whether it has something to do with him or not, but I know that the secret technique that the Heavenly Sword Marquis used came from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect,” the green-haired woman said.

“What?” Mo Shan and the three-eyed man were shocked.

“Bi Yun, are you sure?” Mo Shan immediately asked.

“I’m sure.” The green-haired woman nodded. “I’ve studied the Seven Star Mysterious Sect for a period of time, and I know that the Seven Star Mysterious Sect had five strongest secret techniques at their peak. I’ve also seen the mirror images of some of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect’s experts using these five secret techniques. I can be sure that among the secret techniques that Heavenly Sword Marquis used, the huge golden emperor phantom behind him is one of the five great secret techniques of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the Heaven Punisher!”

“As for the dark golden armor that appeared on his body, it was one of the Five Great Secret Arts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the nine luminaries star armor!”

“Also, you should have noticed that when he was fighting with the rank seven True Saint from the Purple Cloud Pavilion, at first, the divine power aura he emitted was only at the peak of rank four, but later on, his aura suddenly increased and reached the level of a rank five True Saint. He obviously used secret art that could increase his realm in a short period of time, and this secret art should be one of the five great secret arts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the Seven Star Secret Art!”

“Among the five strongest secret techniques of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the Heavenly Sword Marquis cultivated three of them. Do you think he has any relationship with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect?” The green-haired woman looked at Mo Shan and the three-eyed man.

“This, this...” Mo Shan and the three-eyed man looked at each other with a trace of shock in their eyes.

“If I’m not wrong, he must have been lucky and obtained the ancient inheritance of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. or he must have met a peak expert who survived the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and became the disciple of that expert and learned these three secret techniques. But no matter what, he must have some connection with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect,” the green-haired woman continued.

“Originally, it was normal for a cultivator to be lucky enough to obtain the sect’s inheritance or become a disciple of a top-tier expert. However, the Seven Star Mysterious Sect is different! The Seven Star Mysterious Sect is the public enemy of all the great factions in the Third Heaven! ”

“The three great saint realms, the four great divine clans, and the eight directions celestial sect once joined hands to attack the Seven Star Divine Realm. The Seven Star Mysterious Sect was also destroyed because of this. Over a long period of time, the three great saint realm masters in the three great saint realms have been paying attention to the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. Anyone who is related to the Seven Star Mysterious Sect will be killed without mercy!”

“And now, this Heavenly Sword Marquis has the three great secret arts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, and the scene of him fighting with the rank seven True Saint from the Purple Cloud Pavilion has spread all over the Third Heaven. It’s impossible for the three great saint realms not to notice it. Moreover, since I can recognize the secret arts that the Heavenly Sword Marquis used, it’s impossible for the experts from the three great saint realms who have a deeper relationship with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect not to recognize it!”

“Wait, you mean...” Mo Shan narrowed his eyes as he stared at the green-haired lady.

“You should be able to guess what the three great saint realms will do if they find out that the Heavenly Sword Marquis possesses the secret techniques of the three Seven Star Mysterious Sect.” The green-haired lady said.

A sharp glint shot out from Mo Shan’s eyes.

“Mo Shan, don’t be rash!” The green-haired lady hurriedly said, “I know that you admire the Heavenly Sword Marquis very much, but he is still one of the three great saint realms!”

“I understand.” Mo Shan took a deep breath and nodded slightly. “Don’t worry, I know what to do. I don’t dare to provoke the three great saint-level experts, but I need to remind that little fellow that the three great saint-level experts won’t come and kill me directly, right?”
