Chapter 998: The Rock Demon Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The huge man was shocked to hear Jian Wushuang speaking of the name of his skill. “You, too, know about the Immortality Secret Skill?”

“I suppose that confirms my suspicion?” Jian Wushuang’s face slowly broke into a smile.

Not only he knew of it, but it was also a skill he was proficient with.

Jian Wushuang had long reached the highest level of the Immortality Secret Skill.

“This would also mean you know God Hong?” asked Jian Wushuang.

That was the name of the person who taught Jian Wushuang the Immortality Secret Skill.

A long time ago in the Ancient World, Jian Wushuang had chanced upon a finger of God Hong. Through the severed finger, he had acquired the Immortality Secret Skill and he was fortunate to have encountered a fragment of God Hong’s consciousness. The friendship they had forge was hardly something that Jian Wushuang could easily forget.

“Big Brother Hong?” The man was even more shocked.

“Big brother?” Jian Wushuang’s lips curled into a smirk. “I see. You’re close.”

“Of course we’re close.”

The man clenched his fists as he related his tale heavily. “We’re both from the Rock Demon Clan. Big Brother Hong is the greatest warrior of the clan. He’s kind and generous; always keeping our best interests close to his heart. I had once shown a glimpse of my talents a long time ago in the clan, hence he chose me and personally taught me the Immortality Secret Skill.”

“Unfortunately, I grew conceited. I ignored his warnings about the perils outside and wandered out on my own. I was abducted by some stronger enemies who then sold me to this arena.”

“I see…” Jian Wushuang cocked an eyebrow with feigned interest in the tale but quietly, he was thinking to himself.?“The Rock Demon Clan? Is it a junior or a medium population? It does not seem to be a stronger population.”

“Jian Wushuang,” said the Gu King’s voice rang suddenly, “Unless I am mistaken, the Rock Demon Clan bears the bloodline of the Rock Demon Giant, an infamous entity in the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“The Rock Demon Giant?”?Jian Wushuang nodded and thought.?“God Hong has shown me a kindness by imparting me his skills. I should visit him someday as he had bidden me to. Perhaps I can visit his population if opportunity allows.”

“What’s your name?” Jian Wushuang stared at the huge man before him.

“My name is Qing Bin, Sir.” He replied politely.

“You will remain by my side for now. Once my errand is done here, you will lead me to your population where we will meet with God Hong.” Jian Wushuang said.

“You know Big Brother Hong?” Qing Bin asked curiously.

“In a manner of speaking.” Jian Wushuang smiled furtively.

Jian Wushuang was relieved with joy. The Dragon Wing Governor had promised Jian Wushuang that he will lead him to the Golden-clothed Deacon after three years; and now, his meeting with Qing Bin had provided him an inkling as to where God Hong could be. With the offer of the Governor, he and Qing Bin subsequently took up lodgings at his mansion.

In a secret chamber of the Governor’s mansion.

“I have three years until the visit to the abode of the Golden-clothed Deacon. This is an opportunity for me to continue with my training.” Jian Wushuang thought quietly, pleased with the present upkeep.

He had immediately returned to the Tang Empire when his physical body was first restored. Hence he barely had an opportunity to properly train in the Secret Skills he had acquired.

With the restoration of this body, his powers and strength, most notably his Ancient God Power, had increased substantially that he was now a Three-star Ancient God. He could now further enhance his mastery of all of his three Ancient God Secret Skills if he so chose.

The Star-river Secret Skill, was one of the few that strongly required honing.

It was known in full, as the Thirty-four Levels of the Star River. Jian Wushuang had reached the twenty-fourth level of the Star-river Secret Skill when he had reached the Eternal Realm which was synonymous to the rank of the Two-star Ancient God. The Skill allowed him to amplify his powers by seventy-two fold.

With his present rank of a Three-star Ancient God, he could now enhance his mastery of the technique to its highest level.

Alone in the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang focused fully on his training. A month fleeted by swiftly and unnoticed.

“I’ve reached the 30th level!”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes opened with excitement.

With the powers of a Three-star Ancient God, he had reached the 30th level of the Star-river Secret Skill. The newly-attained heights of the Skill would allow his strength to be amplified by ninety-fold!

This made his powers soar once more as his overall strength experienced a greater improvement.

“There is still ample room for improvements. I just became a Three-star Ancient God. I might be able to reach the 31st or even the 32nd level of the Star-river Secret Skill when I reach the pinnacle of a Three-star Ancient God.” Jian Wushuang smiled to himself.

“The Star-river Secret Skill is but merely an ordinary Ancient God Skill which doesn’t take much effort.” The Gu King’s voice rang again.

“Ordinary?” This surprised Jian Wushuang.

The Star-river Secret Skill was unquestionably the most integral technique in his climb to the heights he had attained today.

Most other techniques commonly trained by most other warriors of the Green Fire World would only offer an amplification of strength of up to ten-fold. It was a far cry away from the amplification effects accorded by the Star-river Secret Skill which offered him a boost of ninety-fold! It was hardly an advantage he would rashly dismiss!

“That is only within the Green Fire World. There are warriors with techniques that amplify their powers up to more than a hundredfold in the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang was left speechless as he could only behold with awe at the unmatched greatness of the Eternal Chaotic World.

“You need to focus on developing your very own Dao. With a Dao of your own creation, your strength will soar considerably. The greater is your Dao, so will your strength increases,” said the Gu King. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I know.”Jian Wushuang smiled thinly.

From henceforth, he began spending most of his time in the study of Sword Principles.

The assimilation of the acumen in the creation of the Strongest Sword Principle, the scroll which contained nineteen other Sword Principles with his own extraordinary potential and gifts in learning skills of combat were all helpful to him. Before long, he had progressed at an amazing pace.

In one of the gardens of the Governor’s mansion.

Jian Wushuang was alone in the garden, performing a stroke or two of the swordsmanship he learned absent-mindedly. He waved his blade casually; every stroke that he cast seemed simple and crude, yet each of them was actually complex and intricate beneath the surface.

A figure drifting past the garden witnessed his casual practice.

“Great finesse. He’s very close to developing his own Dao.” The Dragon Wing Governor smiled. With a sudden leap, he disappeared from where he stood and appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Is it not lonely for your blade without the company of a companion, my friend? How about a friendly duel, since we are both practitioners in the skills of using the sword?”

The Dragon Wing Governor laughed loud, the echoes of his laughter spreading across the floral bed of the garden.
