Chapter 1986 Unrivaled! Unmatched!!!

Red Dragon King, the second place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He was second to Emperor Bai.

Red Dragon King was known for his fierce power. The other Great Emperors, besides Emperor Bai, were all weaker than him.

In terms of strength explosion, Jian Wushuang was stronger than an ordinary Great Emperor by one notch. Although he might not have been able to compare favorably with Red Dragon King, he could at least be his match.

“Divine power is at this level. Next, let me see my divine body…” Jian Wushuang was very excited.

His divine body had just been through reorganization.

He could feel that his divine body was very strong and peculiar.

However, he would need to check to know which level he was at.

“Jian Yi, hit me with your all,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Attack you? Master, this…” Jian Yi creased his eyebrows.

“When I tell you to, you should just do it. You shouldn’t be in doubt,” Jian Wushuang smiled and he looked rather confident.

Jian Yi didn’t hesitate anymore. He moved and appeared before Jian Wushuang. He then punched Jian Wushuang’s chest with his right hand.

There was a fierce power that formed.

Jian Wushuang stood there but didn’t move an inch. His divine body wasn’t affected at all.

“Jian Yi, how much strength did you use?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and asked.

“Fifty percent,” Jian Yi answered. He, of course, didn’t dare to use his full force when he was attacking his master.

“Do it again. This time, use full force. On top of that, you can use unique skills,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

It wasn’t because he was arrogant but he was really confident.

At least, the earlier punch was like scratching an itch. He didn’t feel it much.

“Yes.”

Jian Yi nodded.

Jian Yi didn’t hold back that time. He used a hundred percent of his strength. There was a cloud churning around his body and boundless crimson cloud permeated his palm.

Hong!

The crimson palm slammed into Jian Wushuang without hindrance.

The billowing power was terrifying. Even a Peak Emperor God could be easily killed with that slam.

Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to dodge the palm at all.

Bang!

The crimson palm slammed Jian Wushuang and it was ten times stronger than Jian Yi’s earlier punch.

Even so, Jian Wushuang only took one step back and his expression still look rather relaxed.

“This palm could barely move me. It is not enough to hurt me,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “How about this…”

Jian Wushuang had a thought in his mind. The Five Gem Armor that he had always been wearing shrunk and appeared on his palm. He then put it away in his Qian Kun ring.

“I will not wear any armor, I’ll just take the hit with my divine body. Give it a try again,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Five Gem Armor was a treasure given to him by an ancient tribe expert, Wu Hun. Although it was broken, its defensive power was above any ordinary Chaotic Divine Treasure.

For instance, Five Gem Armor could cut down Jian Yi’s attack by ninety percent. Jian Yi naturally couldn’t hurt him. Hence, he wouldn’t be able to examine his current divine power’s strength.

So, he decided to take off his Five Gem Armor directly.

“Master, are you sure about this?” Jian Yi hesitated.

“Don’t talk rubbish. Just do it,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Yi let out a sigh and he attacked again without hesitation.

He used the same move, the same crimson palm that contained terrifyingly strong power. Again, Jian Wushuang didn’t block the attack at all.

The crimson palm hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body again.

Hong!

The terrifying power impacted Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

The power strangled everything madly and it tore a big hole in Jian Wushuang’s chest. There were some organs that shattered into pieces too.

“Master, this…” Jian Yi looked distressed.

However, Jian Wushuang, who had a big opening on his chest, smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t die.”

Just as he said, Jian Yi saw Jian Wushuang’s divine power churning and recovered his opened chest and also the shattered internal organs in an instant. Everything became undamaged again and Jian Wushuang’s fighting power stayed at its peak.

“Hit me again, and this time hit me harder. It’d be best if you could shatter my divine body entirely,” Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Yi.

“Yes,” Jian Yi wasn’t in doubt anymore.

As Jian Yi launched another attack, Jian Wushuang’s divine body collapsed and became a cloud of crimson fog.

Under such circumstances, an ordinary cultivator would have been dead. But Jian Wushuang… Vroom!!! There was boundless divine power that reorganized. In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in the void again.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, “a perfect Chaotic divine body is completely substantiated by divine power. As long as divine power is inexhaustible, no matter how great the damage to the divine body is, it can be recovered. Even if my divine body were to collapse entirely, it could be reorganized and re-substantiate with divine power again!!”

Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.

As long as divine power was inexhaustible, even if the divine body were to collapse entirely, it could be reorganized!

What is this?

This is immortality!!

Back then, when Jian Wushuang had been on the third step of inverse cultivation, Eternal Realm, he had a power that was extremely close to immortality. It was an unprecedented life-force. As long as there was flesh, he could recover himself with time.

However, as he was on the seventh step, he truly possessed immortality.

Immortality allowed him to have no scruples during fierce fights. No matter how badly injured he was, even if his divine body collapsed, he could reorganize it and continue to battle. As long as his divine power was inexhaustible, he wouldn’t die.

Of course, when his divine body collapsed, it would be a huge expense to his divine power to reorganize it.

Jian Wushuang noticed that he had used up almost one-fourth of his divine power whenever he reorganized his divine body.

In other words, his divine body could at most be reorganized four times during a fight.

But even so, he could be recognized as being in defiance of nature.

He could reorganize his divine body four times. It meant that he had four extra lives!

He could be killed for four times. Just how ridiculous was that?

Plus, he was only on the seventh step of inverse cultivation and merely the first stage of the seventh step. It equaled Sir God level in Almighty rank. Then, he could continue to proceed to the second stage, the third stage. By then, his divine power and divine body would improve further.

When he reached the third stage, the final stage of the seventh step, his divine power would be boundless. It would be enough for him to reorganize his divine body a dozen times or more. By then…

“Immune to poison, water and fire, and he’s immortal!”

“This is the perfect Chaotic divine body!!!”

“Unrivaled! Unmatched!!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang bellowed at the bottom of his heart as his eyes glowed with excitement.
