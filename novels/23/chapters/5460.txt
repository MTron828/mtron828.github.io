Chapter 5459 ¬†Luxury Cave Abode

In the current Four Great Secret Realms, it had become an arena for the Inheritors.

In the past, the Inheritors were still mysterious, their numbers were scarce. After ten thousand years, the figures of the Inheritors, while not exactly everywhere, lost the former sense of mystery and the intimidation they once held.

Some powerful beings even discovered that killing a Inheritor didn't seem to provoke retaliation. This emboldened them, and they were no longer as cautious as before. Of course, the precondition was that the difference in strength couldn't be too great.

A tier 6 Emperor going against a tier 4 Inheritor was unacceptable.

If it went unnoticed, it might be fine, but if discovered, the Qishen Temple would blacklist the Emperor, and a warrant would be issued.

Of course, this was the case in the Heavenly Realm; the same treatment didn't apply in the Earthly Realm.

The White Tiger Temple in the Earthly Realm struggled to protect even their own people; there was no time to avenge the Inheritors.

"How things change!" Jian Wushuang mused.

The Inheritors, from being treasures in the beginning, had now become commonplace. He had anticipated it, but not this quickly.

Just ten thousand years, and it had come to this.

After millions, tens of millions, billions of years, and even after several epochs, nurturing countless Emperor-level powerhouses, these Four Great Secret Realms were likely to collapse on their own.

There would be no need for the White Tiger Temple to suppress them; they would be directly occupied by the Inheritors.

Of course, this depended on how many resources were on the Grave God Mountain, and how extravagant they could be in nurturing Emperors.

Qiuhuang smirked, a bit dizzy from drinking. "No matter where you are, you have to pick your side. Remember, I won't say much about the other old folks."

Jian Wushuang stood up and respectfully bowed.

He chatted with Qiuhuang for a long time before taking his leave.

He needed to be cautious.

After all, he was in the Elder Palace.

Although he was an Ultimate Dao Lord, a bit more special than other Inheritors, he couldn't afford to be careless.

Crucially, he didn't have the identity token from the Grave God Mountain, and he didn't know where the uniqueness lay.

Fortunately, Emperor Lu Hua sided with him, giving him a special-grade token, allowing him unrestricted access to the Yuanyang Lake.

Since he had the token, he had joined Lu Hua's faction, clearing any lingering suspicions with Wu Zuo.

However, his goal wasn't to stay in the Elder Palace.

The Ultimate Dao, whether for an Emperor or a Dao Lord, could gain abundant resources on the Grave God Mountain.

There was no need to settle in the Elder Palace or the Four Halls like others.

Exiting the teleportation hall, he saw Gong Miaoyi sitting cross-legged under a spirit tree, silently cultivating.

"Working hard!" Jian Wushuang approached and said casually.

Gong Miaoyi, with exceptional talent, could enter the Grave God Mountain if recommended to Wu Zuo, revealing her foundation in the Ultimate Sword Dao.

Gong Miaoyi opened her enchanting eyes, stood up upon seeing Jian Wushuang, and said, "The power here is very rich, especially with this spirit tree. It's much faster than cultivating in some treasure lands in the Earth Realm."

"The so-called treasure lands you speak of probably don't compare to the value of this tree!" Jian Wushuang suppressed a smile and continued, "Come, let me show you what a top-tier cultivation chamber is like!"

Having said that, he took off into the air, carrying Gong Miaoyi with him.

In addition to Qiuhuang's mentioned dojo, he needed to find a place to settle.

Yuanyang Lake, Thunder Island.

The cultivation ground for the 'Jia-ranked' elders. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Here, there are thousands of caves prepared specifically for Jia-ranked elders.

After Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi arrived at Thunder Island, they first went to a grand hall responsible for Thunder Island.

Displaying their token, the guards here were somewhat surprised but still courteously welcomed Jian Wushuang in.

"Sir, all these caves around are vacant, feel free to choose!" The guard pointed to four concealed caves in mid-air and introduced.

These guards were all Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms, each one a peak-level tier 4 Emperor, yet they were content to do the work of servants in Yuanyang Lake.

Repairing caves, guarding courtyards.

It was too generous from the Elder's Palace, otherwise, a dignified peak-level tier 4 Emperor wouldn't address a Dao Lord as 'sir'.

"Kun Nine Cave, let's choose this one!" Jian Wushuang pointed to the cave near the coast.

The guard respectfully handed over the small flag controlling the cave's formation.

After receiving the flag, Jian Wushuang casually took out a mustard seed and threw it to the guard, "This is the godstones needed for a million years of residence."

Even though it was only opened to Jia-ranked Elders, it still came with a fee.

And the price was steep‚Äîrequiring one billion godstones for 10,000 years.

Even for a tier 6 Emperor, 100 million years was but the blink of an eye, but accumulating 10 billion godstones in the blink of an eye was beyond the reach of a tier 6 Emperor!

However, the tier 6 Emperor of the Elder Palace was different.

The true form of the old man with goat horns controlled an ancient country in the Earth Realm, and he could produce as many godstones as needed.

This was the formidable financial power of the tier 6 Emperor of the Elder Palace.

After paying the godstones, he manipulated a small flag to open a portal in the formation, flying in with Gong Miaoyi.

The guard, after a brief count of the godstones, looked at Jian Wushuang's back with envy. A Dao Lord producing so many godstones without blinking an eye was extraordinary.

Moreover, having a Dao Lord who was accompanied by a more powerful Emperor than himself, whom he couldn't even fathom, made him shudder. That Emperor was at least tier 5, judging by her appearance, and the tremor didn't escape the notice of the guard.

This was not someone he could offend. He dared not look for too long, only able to admire from a distance.

Once inside the formation, the appearance of this cave differed significantly from the outside.

The entrance of the cave, near the beach, was surrounded by many exotic spirit trees, with various rare fruits scattered everywhere. The countless fruits from the outside world were freely available here.

At a glance, it was clear that the astronomical sum of 10 billion godstones was well worth it.

Gong Miaoyi's gaze was heated. Although she now had a considerable fortune, her mindset had not fully adjusted after just becoming wealthy.

Faced with these ordinary treasures, she felt somewhat out of her depth.

"Let's go inside and take a look!" Jian Wushuang said, hands behind his back. There was nothing special outside, but he was curious about what lay within.

Upon entering the cave, there was initially a spacious corridor, with exquisitely painted murals on both sides depicting the essence of the Origin Source Dao.

The power contained in these essences was enticing and beneficial to the consciousness, preventing long-term cultivators from feeling suppressed during seclusion.

From this perspective alone, it was evident that the construction of this cave not only involved expensive treasures but also meticulous attention to detail.

Following Jian Wushuang, Gong Miaoyi looked around, amazed at the opulence displayed here.

Although she was already a Prince in the Earth Realm, her experiences were extensive, but what she had seen was only envied by tier 4 Emperors.

The structure and environment here were enough to make even tier 6 Emperors marvel.

Passing through the corridor led to a massive light-blue hall.

As the two entered the hall and saw its arrangement, they hesitated, almost reluctant to step inside.
