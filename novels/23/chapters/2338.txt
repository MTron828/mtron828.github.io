Chapter 2339: False Reincarnation Cleave!

“Die!”

The experts from Zhuge Family and Xiang Family were on a killing spree and clearly in higher spirits than those from the Lin Family.

Even though the Lin Family had reversed her predicament in terms of Divine Demon Realm battle strength, there were still huge differences between both parties’ Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realms.

It was especially so since Lin Mansion had lost several experts at the beginning of the intense battle. Furthermore, some experts hired by Lin Mansion had escaped when they started noticing things weren’t going their way. Therefore, the Lin Mansion was at a greater disadvantage in terms of Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realms than expected.

In battle, it was common to see two to three similar cultivation base cultivators attacking one Lin Mansion expert.

The only advantage Lin Mansion had was the additional Chaotic Divine Demon. The Zhuge Family had arranged for four Half Step Divine Demon to team up against him. This made it impossible for the additional Chaotic Divine Demon to break away.

Even though those from the Lin Mansion had seen hope and had reignited their fighting spirits, the situation on the ground wasn’t changing.

Weng!!

Jian Wushuang was like a bow and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was like the arrow as he thrust it out.

The razor-sharp sword light clashed against the volcano-like fists of that burly old man. The overbearing force from the collision forced Jian Wushuang and that burly old man a step back.

The next instant, Jian Wushuang moved and vanished creepily from sight. When he showed himself again, he was right next to the blue-haired lady and swinging his sword silently towards her.

He had shown his mastery in Sword Principle. Even though he was facing three Chaotic Divine Demons, he wasn’t losing in any aspect.

While fighting, he had seen the situations in other areas.

He could tell the huge differences between both parties on the battlefield that couldn’t be made up for.

“In terms of overall strength, the differences are too huge. Even if I kill Zhuge Yun and hold back three Chaotic Divine Demons, it will probably not reverse the eventual defeat that awaits the Lin Family.”

“There’s no other way. I have to take a further step!”

A cold, ruthless light gleamed in his eyes as he glanced at that blue-haired lady.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared before their eyes once again.

The three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family started out with the intention to kill Jian Wushuang. However, as the battle progressed, they were getting more and more fearful.

And now, they weren’t even confident of defeating Jian Wushuang in battle, let alone killing him.

“Is this brat really just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm?” the burly old man growled. He had never seen an Early Stage Chaotic Realm that could knock him back with a single sword strike.

“Regardless, this brat has chosen to stand against our Xiang Family. If our Xiang Family can’t erase him this time and he takes note of it, no one will be able to save our Xiang Family, not even the Golden Cauldron Sect!” Xiang Zong roared.

“Kill him! We need a plan to kill him!” the blue-haired lady remarked.

“How do we do it?” the burly old man glanced at the blue-haired lady.

The blue-haired lady and Xiang Zong quieted down.

Yeah, how could they kill him?

They weren’t even confident about defeating him currently. How were they going to kill him?

Moreover, they could tell Jian Wushuang had an extremely profound understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order that even an ordinary Third Grade Divine Demon wouldn’t possess. In fact, even Second Grade Divine Demon might not be at this level of attainment. With his grasp of Spacetime Rules of Order, no one probably could stop him if he intended to escape, not even with all the Divine Demon Realm experts teaming up.

At this juncture, shocking killing intent raged out from the eyes of Jian Wushuang.

Immediately after, Jian Wushuang disappeared creepily before their eyes.

Yes, he vanished!

At the very least, they couldn’t see him with their naked eyes. Even if they used their soul powers, they would barely catch a glimpse of an eerie figure.

When Jian Wushuang showed himself again, he was next to the burly old man. Moreover, he slashed at the head of the burly old man at a speed that was incredibly fast.

“Be careful!” Xiang Zong shouted as a warning.

“Brat! Don’t be too full of yourself!” The burly old man erupted and his scorching-red right hand smashed towards Jian Wushuang like an active giant volcano.

The direct clash of the volcano and the sword shadow didn’t cause any collision of strength.

That sword shadow disappeared together with Jian Wushuang before the watchful eyes of the trio.

“That’s... an illusion?” the burly old man was stumped.

“An illusion left behind with Spacetime Rules of Order?” Xiang Zong was equally astonished. However, his expression darkened instantly. “Shit!”

When Xiang Zong reacted, he looked at where the blue-haired lady was. Indeed, Jian Wushuang was right in front of the blue-haired lady.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang swung out his sword.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle – False... Reincarnation Cleave!”

Weng!

A blurry sword light lit up and sliced towards the blue-haired lady.

The sword light was unusually fast, to the point that almost no one could react to it on time.

However, the blue-haired lady was a Chaotic Divine Demon after all. Although the sudden appearance of Jian Wushuang gave her a huge shock, she reacted immediately. She thrusted the long spear forward and wanted to block the blurry sword light that had been launched by Jian Wushuang.

Her eyes were fixed on that sword light. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I can make it. I can stop it!” the blue-haired lady thought to herself.

She could see her spear was in time to block that sword light.

Just as expected, the black long spear went before that blurry sword light. Instantly, the blue-haired lady was at ease.

Peng!

The sword light had sliced her. As a Chaotic Divine Demon, her holy body was extremely tough. However, it wasn’t sufficient to stop this attack.

In a single strike, her holy body collapsed and her consciousness was fading.

Before it had even vanished completely, she was completely lost.

“Impossible!”

“I did stop it! I stopped that sword strike!!!”

The blue-haired lady wanted to scream but couldn’t enunciate her words. Soon, all signs of life deserted her.

Even in death, the blue-haired lady couldn’t understand how she had been killed by that strike. She had stopped that sword strike!

At the very least, that’s what she believed.

In reality, she hadn’t!

“False Reincarnation Cleave... Illusory and unfathomable.” Jian Wushuang remained scarily cold while staring at the despairing blue-haired lady.

It had been 19 years since he had been reincarnated. In those 19 years, he hadn’t just been thinking of ways to recover to his cultivation base. In addition, his understanding of Rules of Order and advancements in Sword Principle had not lagged behind. On the contrary, they had improved by leaps and bounds.

For example, in the aspect of Spacetime Rules of Order, he had made significant breakthroughs compared to in his previous life. He was just about able to create illusions using Spacetime Rules of Order.

Even though they were illusions and some experts could see through them with a single glance, it was more than sufficient to fool an ordinary Chaotic Divine Demon.

Moreover, in the aspect of the Spacetime Sword Principle, he had created his first move, Snow Cleave!
