Chapter 984: Wedding Ceremony

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, you have proposed to my daughter with wedding gifts in front of all the experts at the Selection Ceremony. Do you want to deny what you have done?” Emperor Xiao smiled and asked jokingly.

“Of course not.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and returned his smile. “I will send a message to my teacher right now.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jian Wushuang immediately messaged Xuan Yi.

Since it was a marriage, his elders should be present.

However, his parents were not by his side, so his teacher should be his wedding officiant.

“I prepared the wedding gifts for you 1,000 years ago, but you haven’t gotten married until now.” Xuan Yi was on cloud nine after receiving Jian Wushuang’s message. “I cannot be your wedding officiant because I have something urgent to do right now. I’ll message your Senior Brother and ask him to be your wedding officiant.”

“My Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Thank you very much, teacher.”

Jian Wushuang soon stopped his communication with Xuan Yi.

In the hall, he looked up and said, “My teacher has something urgent on hand and cannot leave for the time being. He’ll ask my Senior Brother to be my wedding officiant.”

“Your Senior Brother? Master Blood Saber?” Emperor Xiao raised his eyebrows.

It was reasonable for his Senior Brother to be his wedding officiant instead of his teacher.

“What a pity.” The Tang Emperor shook his head. He was very curious about Xuan Yi and originally hoped to meet him at the wedding ceremony; however, it seemed that would be impossible now.

“In that case, we don’t have to bother especially choosing a lucky day. You might as well get married tomorrow,” the Tang Emperor said directly.

“Tomorrow? Why should we be in such a hurry?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“What? You are unwilling to do that?” Tang Emperor asked meaningfully.

“No, no.” Jian Wushuang shook his head again and again.

“Girl,” the Tang Emperor looked at Leng Rushuang with deep eyes, in which some profound meaning was revealed, and asked, “are you ready to get married tomorrow?”

“Okay,” Leng Rushuang replied gently.

“That’s settled then. Order our men to prepare for it.” The Tang Emperor waved his hand.

Emperor Xiao immediately stood up to make preparations for the next day’s wedding.

Jian Wushuang was a little confused. He knew that he would marry Leng Rushuang, but he did not expect this day to come so soon.

…

Jian Wushuang, who had almost been deified by others, returned alive and was going to marry Leng Rushuang, the Princess of the Tang of the East. The news spread throughout this country and even the entire Green Fire World like a storm in less than half a day.

In an instant, people throughout all of the Green Fire World were shocked, and those in the Tang of the East seethed with excitement.

As soon as they received the news, many clans, forces, and experts in the Tang of the East prepared gifts immediately and sent their men to the imperial palace that very day. Many experts even hurried there to congratulate them personally.

In the meantime, experts in the Green Fire World dispatched people to send gifts as well. Those who had no time to send gifts there expressed their congratulations as soon as they were able to.

Jian Wushuang had great potential. Moreover, the Tang Emperor already returned to the Tang of the East. With him protecting this country, it would be as stable as Mount Tai.

Everyone offered their congratulations to them, be it for the sake of Jian Wushuang or the Tang Emperor.

Even three big countries that were just forced by the Tang Emperor prepared gifts after receiving the news and sent them to the imperial palace as quickly as possible.

Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian, also arrived at the imperial palace through the Void Temple’s wormhole on the same day.

In less than half a day, the Tang of the East had made thorough preparations for the next day’s wedding.

The night was bright with moonlight.

Dressed in a white robe, Leng Rushuang nestled in Jian Wushuang’s arms at the top of a nine-layered pavilion and looked at the moonlight shining below.

“Did you feel better after taking the Crape Myrtle Elixir?” Jian Wushuang asked.

1,200 years ago, when he realized that he could not anticipate his end after forcibly swallowing King Luo Zhen’s Essence Blood, he handed the Crape Myrtle Elixir to Leng Rushuang. Now, 1,200 years had passed and Leng Rushuang should have taken it and the Icy Heart Poison inside her should have been suppressed.

“I feel a whole lot better. Today, grandmaster personally examined my body and he said I was fine.” Leng Rushuang forced out a smile.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang knitted his brows.

According to what Gu King had said, Leng Rushuang was not just poisoned by the Icy Heart Poison. Most important of all, she was a Primordial Great Sinner.

A Primordial Great Sinner was born to suffer. How could a Crape Myrtle Elixir really solve all this?

Though he had doubts in his mind, he still felt that it was not so good to ask any more questions now that the Tang Emperor had said Leng Rushuang was fine.

“I’d better look for an opportunity to ask the Tang Emperor about that clearly,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The hazy moonlight shone on the vast imperial palace. It seemed as if the entire imperial palace was covered with a layer of silver and it looked very beautiful.

“I feel so good,” Leng Rushuang murmured. Her voice resounded around Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“You can snuggle in my arms until the end of time,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I did not expect to hear such words come from your mouth.” Leng Rushuang looked up at Jian Wushuang.

“Hmm…” Jian Wushuang was speechless. He was indeed rather ignorant about love affairs.

“We’re going to get married tomorrow, but unfortunately, my father won’t be able to come here.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and some bitterness was revealed in his eyes.

It had been almost 2,000 years since his father, Jian Nantian, separated from him in the Ancient World. He had not received any message from him during this period.

“Uncle Xiao should know my father’s whereabouts. When the wedding is over and everything in the Tang of the East has settled down, I have to set off to find my father,”?Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Right at that moment…

“Eh!”

Leng Rushuang let out a muffled groan and her face turned a little pale.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Nothing. The wind blows strongly here. Let’s go back,” Leng Rushuang explained.

“Fine.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He turned back and left with Leng Rushuang.

At this point, there were traces of struggling and shivering in the depths of Leng Rushuang’s eyes; even Jian Wushuang failed to notice it.

Leng Rushuang roared in her heart.

“Please! Please give me one more day!

“One day is enough!

“The last day…”

The energy that had been raging inside her gradually subsided as if it had heard her growl. Her expression gradually turned normal and she walked toward her room with Jian Wushuang.
