Chapter 3041: Passed

__________

Swish!

Jian Wushuang’s figure had disappeared into thin air. In its place was a strange silver stream of light, followed by a sword light.

It was incredibly fast.

When the sword light lit up, the black-clothed woman’s eyes shrank, and a trace of horror flashed across her face.

The sword was so fast that the black-clothed woman did not react at all.

Chi!

The sword light flashed and the black-clothed woman’s head flew away.

In just one move, the black-clothed woman among the three gatekeepers had been killed.

“Humph!”

With an angry snort, the stocky elder had already arrived in front of Jian Wushuang. He held a big hammer in each of his hands and his body was covered with a large number of black thunderbolts. It was as if the Thunder God had come to the world, and he suddenly attacked Jian Wushuang.

“Good timing.”

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and threw out his sword with his right hand.

At the moment he threw out his sword, a shocking sword essence suddenly burst out.

Space-time sword art, Xi Xiang!

Bang!

A low collision sound was heard. The stocky elder’s body suddenly trembled and he immediately retreated in a sorry state.

Before Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of space-time principles had reached a breakthrough, he had used all of his strength to use Xi Xiang to clash with the stocky elder. He had barely gained the upper hand. But now, his comprehension of space-time principles had reached the third stage! The power of Jian Wushuang’s Xi Xiang move had increased by three times!

When the two fought again, it was naturally a crushing blow.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s body flashed and he attacked the last white-robed woman.

The white-robed woman used her soul attack and controlled the strange spears to flash toward Jian Wushuang one after another. However, Jian Wushuang easily dodged them. Then, the sword light flashed past the white-robed woman and she was killed.

In just a moment, two of the three gatekeepers were killed, and the burly elder was completely crushed. The result was naturally out.

“Boy, congratulations on reaching the top of Di Mountain.”

The burly elder stood aside and watched Jian Wushuang.

The divine bodies of the black-robed woman and the white-robed woman, who had been ‘killed’ by Jian Wushuang, were restored. They looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look in their eyes.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

At this moment, a figure condensed on the top of Di Mountain. It was Elder Gu, who had been watching the battle from the side.

“Congratulations, little guy.” Elder Gu looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of joy on his face as he said, “It has been a long time since Master left this secret realm. Now, someone can finally pass the test left by Master!”

“Little guy, come with me.”

Elder Gu waved his hand, and a space passage appeared in the void around Di Mountain.

Elder Gu led Jian Wushuang directly into the space passage.

They were still in the secret realm, but it was still the core and the most important area of the secret realm.

They were still in a palace, but the palace was 30,000 feet tall and vast.

As soon as Jian Wushuang stepped into the palace, he looked through the void and saw a figure sitting on a lofty throne at the end of the palace.

It was a slender, three-meter-tall, handsome young man.

The young man’s skin was fair, tender, and even better than many beautiful women.

He wore a snow-white velvet coat with golden edges, and his long brown hair fell to his shoulders. He looked lazy, but he had a pair of deep eyes that seemed to contain billions of stars. Above those deep eyes were two sword-shaped eyebrows.

These two sword-shaped eyebrows were like two peerless divine swords in a scabbard. As long as they were slightly bunched up, a terrifying sword essence would burst out.

The young man sat on the throne lazily. There was no aura emanating from his body, making him look extremely ordinary.

However, even though the young man was sitting at the end of the palace, he was still far away from Jian Wushuang. The young man did not even raise his head to look at him. He just sat there, it still made Jian Wushuang feel a trace of respect.

Yes, it was respect! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was an instinctive respect for experts.

“Little guy, come with me to see Master,” Elder Gu said.

“Master? Is that the Master of the secret realm?” Jian Wushuang was quite excited.

He followed Elder Gu and slowly walked toward the palace.

After a while, they finally arrived at the center of the palace and in front of the towering throne.

As they walked here, the reverence in Jian Wushuang’s heart grew stronger and stronger.

“Master,” Elder Gu said.

His voice was gentle, but it was absolutely respectful.

On the towering throne, the three-meter-tall handsome man moved slightly. Then he slowly raised his eyelids. His pitch-black, emotionless eyes looked directly at Elder Gu and Jian Wushuang.

The moment Jian Wushuang sensed the handsome man’s eyes, his heart turned cold, as if he had completely fallen into an ice cellar.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had lived for two lifetimes and had experienced many storms. In his last life, he had even seen countless top experts. Although those experts were restricted by geaven and earth and could not unleash their true strength and power, however, Jian Wushuang had seen some incredible methods.

Therefore, although Jian Wushuang was full of awe in front of this handsome man, he did not lose his composure too much.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, greetings, senior,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

He could see that the handsome man in front of him had died a long time ago, leaving behind only a consciousness incarnation.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

An ancient and deep voice slowly came out of the handsome man’s mouth. “Did you pass the Di Mountain test that I left behind?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Master, this little guy is extremely talented and has an extraordinary background,” Elder Gu said.

“I know.” The handsome man nodded.

He had created the secret realm himself. Although Elder Gu was in charge of many things in the secret realm, as the Master of the secret realm, he knew all the things that had happened in the secret realm. For example, when Jian Wushuang had tried to get the corpse puppet army, the handsome man had seen that his soul had been killed six or seven times in order to survive the test.

“Once his soul is destroyed, he will definitely die. This is a common thing of the heavenly axiom, but this little guy completely goes against the common knowledge of the heavenly axiom. He is a special anomaly in the heaven and earth, and the heavenly axiom does not allow him to exist.” The handsome man glanced at Jian Wushuang with a strange look in his eyes.

“In any case, since you have passed the Di Mountain test that I left behind, what I left in the secret realm will naturally belong to you.”

The handsome man’s voice rang out slowly.
