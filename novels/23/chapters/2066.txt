2067 Returning to Ancient God Sanctuary!

“Judging from the aura, this godly spirit has the power of a Great Emperor,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

If one godly spirit alone had so much power, then the battle power of five of them when used together would be…

“Looks like I have my hands on another life-saving item.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

After keeping the godly spirit in the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror, Jian Wushuang set off.

The territory that belonged to the special tribes was far away from human territory. Jian Wushuang had spent ten years on getting to Ancient God Sanctuary initially.

As his social status improved, he could use many hidden wormholes within Sanctuary Alliance, which shortened the time needed to travel.

He passed through the wormhole and appeared at Ancient God Sanctuary.

He did not sense anything different when he arrived back at Ancient God Sanctuary after so many years of absence.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that the information that Sanctuary Alliance had was not from wild guesses. There had to be a civil war going on.

“I should go to Gu King City and ask King Gu Tong and get an update from him on the civil war,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Within Ancient God Clan, there were Nine Great King Cities. Where he was, he was closest to Gu King City.

He arrived in the void above Gu King City soon after thanks to how quick he was.

Hum!!

Jian Wushuang used his Soul power to cover the entire Gu King city.

After using his soul power to scan the city, he frowned.

“What is going on? King Gu Tong, King Gu You and King Gu Yi are all missing.” Jian Wushuang was suspicious.

He came to Gu King City before. This city was controlled by the Ancient Clan. The master of the city was Abysmal King.

However, Jian Wushuang did not sense any familiar aura within Gu King City. On the contrary, he sensed many foreign presences.

These foreign experts sensed his daring use of his soul power and were alarmed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Within seconds, seven figures rose from the city and appeared in front of Jian Wushang.

The weakest among the seven was a Seven-star Ancient God, while the strongest was an Eight-star Ancient God.

“Who are you? And why are you here?” The muscular Eight-star Ancient God said as he gazed at Jian Wushuang.

He saw the eight stars between Jian Wushuang’s brows, and treated him as an expert of the same power level.

“I am Gu Jian. I have just returned from the human territory.” Jian Wushuang responded by giving the alias he had used when he’d first come to Ancient God Sanctuary. “As far as I know, the masters of this city are the brothers, King Gu You and King Gu Tong. Why are they not here?”

“King Gu You? King Gu Tong? Are you part of the Ancient Clan since your surname is Gu?” The Eight-star Ancient God and the six remaining Seven-star Ancient God faces turned cold.

“I am indeed part of the Ancient Clan.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and admitted.

“Haha. You have the courage to come here after Ancient Clan’s betrayal. Shouldn’t you be staying within Luo Wang City?” The Eight-star Ancient god scoffed so loudly that his voice reverberated in the king city.

“Betrayal?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Everyone, he is a rebel from the Ancient Clan. Assist me in arresting him! If he resists, kill him!!!” The Eight-star ancient god bellowed.

Immediately, he led the rest and attacked Jian Wushuang.

These seven Ancient Gods used their fighting power when they attacked. They used a wide array of skills: some revealed Universal Laws while some used the Ancient God finger.

The different Ancient God secret skills and Ancient God lost knowledge were executed perfectly.

Upon seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“Get lost!”

His roar was accompanied by a mix of endless divine power and bloodline power that was far superior to most Ancient Gods’.

The Ancient God bloodline power radiated out in waves within the city.

The seven Ancient Gods who attacked Jian Wushuang were stunned and stopped in their tracks. All of their attacks disintegrated.

They gazed at Jian Wushuang in awe.

They could sense how strong Jian Wushuang was from that simple roar. Additionally, they felt the aura from his bloodline power.

That aura from his bloodline power made them feel like submitting and worshipping Jian Wushuang.

“This aura… It’s, it’s the aura of an emperor?”

“How can this be? How can someone from the Ancient Clan have the aura of an emperor? They are traitors.”

“Who is he? Who is he?”

These Ancient Gods looked at Jian Wushuang in terror. The Eight-star Ancient God too stared in disbelief.

Jian Wushuang looked at them coldly. He snorted and left after scanning the seven Ancient Gods. He did not retaliate in return.

The Ancient Gods heaved a sigh of relief after Jian Wushuang left the void above the city and went out of sight.

When Jian Wushuang stood there, the aura made their cores tremble in fear, and forced them to worship him. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That man… He said his name is Gu Jian and he returned from the human territory recently. His bloodline power felt purer than that of a royal Ancient God. Is he the man that Luo Yu King and the rest support?” The Eight-star Ancient God widened his eyes when he thought of this.

“He actually personally came to Ancient God Sanctuary!”

“No. I must report this to Lord Chen Xi immediately!!”

The Eight-star Ancient God whipped out a transmission token and sent the message.

...

After leaving Gu King City, Jian Wushuang travelled for a while before stopping in midair.

He looked back in the direction of Gu King City. He squinted his eyes slightly and thought to himself. “That is indeed Gu King City, where I first cultivated the Ancient God skills and Ancient God lost knowledge. Back then, the city was under the control of the Ancient God Clan. Now, Gu You King and Gu Tong King are no longer in the city anymore. The people in the city even think of me as a traitor when I reveal my surname?”

“My master, fighting power is what determines who gets to rule over the Great King cities within the Ancient God Clan. It is normal for the masters of these cities to change every once in a while. However, even if a new Ancient God defeats the previous master of the city, the previous master will just leave the city. He will not be seen as a traitor.”

“Evidently, something big happened within the Ancient God Clan.”

King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang.
