Chapter 188: Provocation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the coming days, Jian Wushuang continued to hunt in the Easternmost Plain while Tang Wuji sincerely followed him and provided him with information about the other bandits.

It should be mentioned that Tang Wuji was a worthy member of the Pavilion of Raindrops, who was very good at collecting information.

What he provided was amazingly precise.

Jian Wushuang dealt with the gangs of bandits one by one according to Tang Wuji’s information.

He directly broke into the dens of those bandits, killed the fugitives who had armlets in a simple and brutal way, and then left. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Among the many bandits in the Easternmost Plain, only a few of them were able to threaten Jian Wushuang. With his strength and precise information, he didn’t need to be so cautious.

Four days passed in the blink of an eye.

At night, the stars were glowing, shining on the boundless plain.

Jian Wushuang casually sat cross-legged with a slightly serious expression.

“Tomorrow is the last day of the hunt, but I don’t know if I have enough armlets,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The toughest part was the unclear specification of the hunting in stage one.

No matter how many armlets you had, you would attempt to kill more fugitives and get more armlets so that you could feel relieved.

“Tang Wuji.” Jian Wushuang looked over at the man who was snoring in his sleep.

Tang Wuji instantly woke up with a start and asked, “Boss, is there anything I can do for you?”

“Today, you mentioned that there is a gang of bandits which are led by a Blood Jade fugitive, is that right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Exactly.” Tang Wuji nodded and said, “I heard this from the First Leader of the Purple Fire Gang. That man is named Gu Changsheng, a high-profile person who always invites famous bandits to his feasts. The First Leader of the Purple Fire Gang had ever been to the feast and knew Gu Changsheng was a Blood Jade fugitive.”

Jian Wushuang slightly narrowed his eyes and said, “Generally speaking, Blood Jade fugitives reach the Profound Yin Void Realm, with only a few of them reaching the Exceptional Yin Void Realm. But what level is Gu Changsheng at?”

“The Peak of the Profound Yin Void Realm,” Tang Wuji answered.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up as he said, “All right. Tomorrow, Gu Changsheng is our target.”

“Okay.” Tang Wuji immediately nodded with excitement.

An ordinary person would definitely think Jian Wushuang had gone mad when he, a warrior at the Profound Gold Core Realm, vainly attempted to deal with a warrior at the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm.

But Tang Wuji didn’t.

After all, while following Jian Wushuang these last four days, he had witnessed Jian Wushuang kill many strong bandits one by one, even though he was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm.

The bandits in the Initial Yin Void Realm were almost killed by Jian Wushuang with a single move.

Even counting warriors in the Profound Yin Void Realm, Jian Wushuang had killed three in these last four days.

Moreover, he directly broke into their dens and killed them under the siege of a large number of bandits.

Since he was able to kill warriors of the Profound Yin Void Realm, even while surrounded, he was also able to kill those warriors in the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm.

...

The next morning.

There were a lot of bandits gathering around the villiages in the Easternmost Plain.

Good liquor and gourmet food were placed on the long narrow tables. Several beautiful women who were caught were dancing in the center of the room.

“Come on. White Lady, a toast to you since it is so hard to meet you,” said a strapping and intelligently dressed elder, with a smile, who held a bowl of liquor.

“First Leader Gu, I should toast to you,” said the absolutely beautiful lady in white, as she slightly smiled and picked up the bowl. Many bandits had been charmed by her every movement.

However, suddenly...

“Bang!”

The door of the village was kicked open and a middle-aged man with a round belly entered.

That was Tang Wuji.

As soon as he entered the village, he directly yelled in a swaggeringly way, “Where is Gu Changsheng? My boss asks me to leave you a message.”

Many bandits in the village immediately looked towards Tang Wuji, including Gu Changsheng and White Lady.

“What?” While looking at Gu Changsheng, Tang Wuji instantly grinned and said, “Gu Changsheng, my boss is interested in your head and would like to compete with you in the ten-mile plain. He is already waiting there. If you are afraid of death, you can stay here.”

After finishing his words, Tang Wuji paid no attention to their responses as he immediately turned around and left.

The atmosphere of the village instantly became depressing.

“Humph!”

Gu Changsheng looked gloomy. Spiritual Power burst from his palm that was holding the bowl, immediately causing the bowl to crack.

“I’m going to see who the hell he is.”

Then, Gu Changsheng immediately Voidwalked and violently rushed in the direction which Tang Wuji left.

White Lady and many other bandits immediately followed him.

In a vacant field, not far away from the village, sat Jian Wushaung, who carried the long sword.

Shortly afterward, Tang Wuji came trotting and yelling, “Boss, he is coming. Gu Changsheng is coming.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. When a giant figure rushed toward him from the front air, he spontaneously showed a cold smile.

Jian Wushuang stood up while Tang Wuji dodged behind him.

“Whoosh!”

It was Gu Changsheng, the giant figure, suddenly descended with many bandits following.

“Fat guy, where is your boss?” Gu Changsheng coldly looked at Tang Wuji.

“My boss is right here.” Tang Wuji pointed to Jian Wushuang.

“Hum?” Gu Changsheng then looked over at Jian Wushuang. After observing that the aura from Jian Wushuang was of the Profound Gold Core Realm, his bleak eyes suddenly lit up.

“How dare you fool me?”

“Gu Changsheng,” Jian Wushuang started to speak, in an icy voice, “He did not fool you. It is I that wanted to compete with you. And I’m really interested in taking your head.”

The Triple-kill Sword had been drawn from behind Jian Wushuang and an overwhelming sword essence was slowly being released.

Having seen this, the gang of bandits following Gu Changsheng wore an awkward look.

Tang Wuji was at least a warrior in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. However, Jian Wushuang was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm?

Was a warrior of the Profound Gold Core Realm interested in the head of an expert who reached the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm?

Had he gone crazy?

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t care about it at all. With a flash of icy-cold sword light, he had taken action.

“Go to hell!”

Gu Changsheng kept still with a bleak face. But his Spiritual Power had transformed into a sharp blade, violently rushing toward Jian Wushuang.
