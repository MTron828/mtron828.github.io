Chapter 1572: Brother In Danger

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After leaving the opportunity and the test behind, Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief.

“I’ve done what I wanted to. Young man, it depends on you if you can grab the opportunity,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The test that he left behind for Chen Hu wasn’t exactly difficult. It was already Jian Wushuang’s lowest standard.

If Chen Hu couldn’t even pass through that test, it would be difficult for him to achieve something when he got to Eternal Chaotic World with his guidance. He might as well stay in Qing Tian Mystery Land for the rest of his life.

If Chen Hu were to pass the test and if he was willing to, Jian Wushuang could bring him to Eternal Chaotic World and teach him patiently. No matter how badly he did, he should be able to become a top Universe God. He might even stand a chance to become Real God.

After he found out about Chen Hu, Jian Wushuang had no more reason to miss Qing Tian Mystery Land. He immediately left.

In Star land, Green Feather Pavilion.

The Master of Green Feather Pavilion and the few elderlies, including Ming Ba, were waiting there in silence.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang stepped out of the space tunnel gradually.

The moment they saw Jian Wushuang, the Master of Green Feather Pavilion and the rest of the elderlies were shocked.

They realized that Jian Wushuang had truly recovered.

“Master of Green Feather Pavilion, thank you for your hospitality over the past years,” Jian Wushuang glanced at the master of Green Feather Pavilion.

“Haha, you’re welcome. I have to congratulate you that you have finally resumed to your peak,” the Master of Green Feather Pavilion smiled.

“I have to request Master to not spread this news just yet,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” The Master of Green Feather Pavilion raised his eyebrows. Although he didn’t know Jian Wushuang’s intention, he nodded in agreement.

“Farewell.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t stay in Green Feather Pavilion and left very soon.

In Green Feather Pavilion, the Master of Green Feather Pavilion and the other elderlies including Ming Ba gathered.

“Elder Ming Ba, you said that not only did Jian Wushuang recovered to his peak, his power became even stronger?” The Master of Green Feather Pavilion looked at Ming Ba, “How did you know he became stronger? Unless you fought with him?”

“We didn’t fight, but I could feel it,” Ming Ba immediately shared what had happened to him.

“With just one glance, it struck fear into you?”

“His voice made you dizzy and unconscious but never caused you any harm?”

The Master of Green Feather Pavilion and the other elderlies exchanged a look and there was astonishment in their eyes.

“It seems that Jian Wushuang really became scarier. He told us not to spread the news. It seems that he didn’t want to attract any attention,” the Master of Green Feather Pavilion sighed.

At the same time, they were also glad that they didn’t mistreat Jian Wushuang when he lost all his power back then. Otherwise, if Jian Wushuang were to resent it, Green Feather Pavilion would be in big trouble.

…

After leaving Green Feather Pavilion, Jian Wushuang immediately took out a communication token.

“Hall Master Yuan, I already came out from Qing Tian Mystery Land.”

Hall Master Yuan immediately replied when he received the message, “The Master of Green Feather Pavilion sent me a message earlier too. He said that you have recovered. In other words, you have passed through your third inverse cultivation test?”

“Yes, I’ve passed through it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s great!” Hall Master Yuan was delighted.

One should know that Jian Wushuang had been in the state of passing his test for the past twenty-one thousand years but Hall Master Yuan had endured heavy pressure on behalf of Jian Wushuang.

For instance, Jian Wushuang’s position as a disciple of Star Palace, there were a large number of disciples in Lineage of Star, including some elderlies who were upset, but Hall Master Yuan took the pressure and was yet to take away Jian Wushuang’s right as a disciple of Star Palace.

Plus, over the years, he had been paying close attention to Jian Wushuang. Everything that Jian Wushuang had encountered in Qing Tian Mystery Land, he had made Green Feather Pavilion report to him every once in a while.

He himself had been constantly looking for information about the third inverse cultivation test.

He had been living in worry for the past years. Until then, when he had found out that Jian Wushuang finally passed the third inverse cultivation test, and he could once again be at ease.

Then, he was naturally thrilled!

Once he had passed the third inverse cultivation test, Jian Wushuang’s potential became extraordinary.

To Lineage of Star, it of course brought unbelievably great benefits.

Soon, Hall Master Yuan calmed down and asked, “Jian Wushuang, as you’ve passed through the third inverse cultivation test, your power should have increased tremendously, right?”

“Power?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Every single inversion cultivation test that he had passed through had brought about a transformation with tremendous changes.

His transformation during the third inverse cultivation test was the greatest and his power had increased at terrifying speed.

“Hall Master Yuan, my Power did increased on a huge scale but if I don’t fight with anyone, I can’t gauge to what level my power has reached,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Is that so?” Hall Master Yuan understood.

“Hall Master Yuan, I shall return to Lineage of Star now. I’ll discuss it with you in detail after I come back?” Jian Wushuang said.

“No, you don’t have to rush back,” Hall Master Yuan shook his head.

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Jian Wushuang, I have something to tell you,” Hall Master Yuan’s face grew solemn, “Thirty years ago, there was an incident that happened at Four Symbol Land in Colored Glaze Sanctuary. A Universe God killed an outstanding core disciple of Four Symbol Mansion at Four Symbol Land before all cultivators. The Four Symbol Mansion was curious and started chasing after the Universe God.”

“Just that? What does it have to do with me?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

“Of course, it’s related to you! Because the Universe God who chased after was the top genius that wandered with you in Wu Bei’s cave and the one very close to you… Duan Lingfeng!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed.

Duan Lingfeng?

Duan Lingfeng was being hunted?

“How is he doing now?” Jian Wushuang asked closely as he grew anxious.

He stepped foot into Eternal Chaotic World for more than tens of thousands of years. During the years, he had a few close friends, like Fiery King, Ling Feibai and him.

However, among his close friends, the one who had really been through life and death situations with him and shared a tight-knitted relationship like brothers, was really just one person.

And that person was Duan Lingfeng!

Back when he had first met Duan Lingfeng, in Ancient Stars Sea long ago, Duan Lingfeng and he had joined forces to kill a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven from Sky-devouring Clan.

Later, in Wu Bei’s cave, when they met again, they had also joined forces to deal with one dangerous situation after another.

In the end, Duan Lingfeng had even given him a White Blaze Fruit Tree directly.

Back then, Jian Wushuang asked him to not reject him if he were to need any favour from him in the future.

Jian Wushuang had also promised that, as long as it didn’t violate his principles, he wouldn’t refuse under any circumstances.

Then he found out that Duan Lingfeng was being chased after for the past thirty years?

How could he not be worried!!!
