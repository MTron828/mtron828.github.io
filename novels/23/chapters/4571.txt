4573 Arriving at the Divine Palace of Life

In the universe!

Thank you readers!

Jian Wushuang, Ninth Kalpa King, and Lan Lan were flying in the direction of the Divine Life Palace.

Along the way, many top forces had already learned that the divine universe had fallen. They packed up their belongings and fled to the remote areas of the universe.

Only the sects and some mortals who lived at the bottom of the universe still did not know everything. They did not know that the world had changed.

The entire universe was in chaos.

!!

Among them, many people took advantage of the situation.

Many of the leaders of the various powers, the Patriarchs of the various clans, and all the famous and influential figures in the past, had all turned into cosmic pirates at this moment. They plundered everything in their path in order to prepare for their secluded cultivation.

Therefore, the road was filled with wails and the flames of war.

When people were not bound by order, they were no different from wild beasts.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang slapped an Intermediate Supreme who was confused and wanted to rob the three of them, turning him into dust. Then, he said, “We have to speed up. I’m afraid many forces have the same plan as us and want to hide in the Forbidden Zones.”

Ninth Kalpa King nodded in agreement.

The three of them did not waste any more time. They released their auras and flew toward the Divine Life Palace.

Some of the Supreme expertswho had wanted to take advantage of the situation suppressed their palpitations and let the three of them leave when they sensed their auras and knew that they were Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King.

A few months later.

The three of them arrived at the Divine Life Palace in the depths of the universe.

All in all, the deep part of the universe was still bustling. It was obvious that the news of the collapse of the Divine Power Universe had not yet reached this place.

The two disciples who were in charge of guarding the gate of the Divine Life Palace were chatting leisurely.

When he saw Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang coming, he immediately shuddered and quickly stood up and said respectfully, “Supreme Wushuang, Supreme Ninth Kalpa.”

Jian Wushuang nodded at him. Without wasting any time, he asked, “Where are the Supreme Xue Bo and the others?”

“Supreme Wushuang, Lord Xue Bo and the others are all in the Supreme Temple.”

Within the Supreme Temple, Supreme Xue Bo Supreme, Supreme Jun Fu, and Supreme Tian Yi were discussing the current situation. Their tone was quite optimistic.

Obviously, they did not know the news that the Divine Power Universe had been broken.

As soon as Jian Wushuang, Ninth Kalpa King, and Lan Lan stepped in, Supreme Tian Yi, Jun Fu, and Xue Bo, who were facing the door, noticed the three of them.

“Eh? Jian Wushuang, Ninth Kalpa King? And a disciple of Lord Cosmos God? Why are you guys back?” Supreme Tian Yi asked, his brows twitching.

“At this time, shouldn’t Jian Wushuang and the others be fighting in the Offworld Battlefield against the Void Universe?”

“Could it be that they had already defeated the Void Universe?”

“That’s right. Why are the three of you the only ones who returned? Where’s Supreme Gai Fu?”

Supreme Jun Fu asked. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang and the other two did not reply. Instead, they lowered their heads and sighed as they looked at the two people’s eyes that were filled with expectation and joy.

He did not know how to tell the three of them this cruel news.

Among the three of them, only Supreme Xue Bo noticed that Jian Wushuang and the other two’s expressions were somewhat abnormal.

He gestured for Jun Fu and Tian Yi to quiet down.

Then, he took a deep breath and looked at Jian Wushuang and the other two seriously. He asked slowly, “Jian Wushuang, did something happen on the Offworld Battlefield? You can speak your mind.”

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He was not an indecisive person. He knew that the news would spread to the depths of the universe sooner or later. The most important thing now was to evacuate.

“Supreme Xue Bo, we… lost.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered as he said this.

As soon as he finished speaking, it was as if a stone had caused a thousand ripples. Supreme Xue Bo and the other two were shocked and could not believe their ears.

“What? We’ve been defeated?”

Supreme Jun Fu and Supreme Tian Yi’s expressions changed drastically, and their eyes were filled with shock.

They had thought that even if the Divine Power Universe could not defeat the Void Universe in a short time, it could not have been defeated so quickly.

Of the three, only the Xue Bo chuckled wryly, not too surprised.

When he saw the three of them appear here together, he had a bad feeling in his heart. He did not expect that it would be as he had expected.

“Then… where’s Supreme Gai Fu?”

Supreme Xue Bo took three deep breaths in a row before he managed to suppress his emotions.

“Supreme Gai Fu has fallen. He’s not the only one who has fallen. Lord Cosmos God has also died on the Offworld Battlefield.”

Jian Wushuang replied again.

It was as if another bombshell had been dropped in the minds of the three Supreme experts.

When Surpeme Xue Bo and the other two heard this, their legs turned to jelly and they almost fell to the ground.

“How is that possible? How did this happen?”

The faces of Supreme Xue Bo and the other two were pale as if their blood had been sucked dry. They muttered in disbelief.

They had never thought that someone as powerful as Lord Cosmos God would die one day.

“Doesn’t that mean that the people of the Void Universe are about to attack?”

Supreme Xue Bo raised his head, trembling, and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“That’s correct.” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied, “Fengtian Patriarch used his life to delay the Void Universe. However, I’m afraid he won’t be able to delay them for long. The people from the Void Universe will completely erode the Divine Power Universe in no time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Supreme Xue Bo and the other two were once again dazed.

Fortunately, the three of them were not emotional people. After a short while, they regained their spirits.

The past could not be traced back. The Divine Power Universe had already been destroyed, and Cosmos Gods and the others had died. What they should be thinking about next was what to do in the future.

“Supreme Xue Bo, my suggestion is for the entire divine Palace to move away from the depths of the universe and find another place.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning as he spoke.

“Move? Find another place?”

Supreme Tian Yi’s brows twitched upon hearing this, but he shook his head in a resolute manner. “No, I don’t agree. This is the root of the Divine Life Palace, the place where I, Tian Yi, was born. If you want to leave, you can leave. At worst, I’ll die in the Divine Life Palace. It’s just death. What do I have to fear?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but frown and said, “Supreme Tian Yi, this is a critical moment, a life and death situation. I hope you can consider the big picture.”

“Jian Wushuang, I know you mean well. Unfortunately, the Divine Life Palace has done a great favor for me. I can’t abandon it and leave. You can go. I’ll stay here and send the Divine Life Palace on its last journey. I’m willing to be buried with the Divine Life Palace.”

Supreme Tian Yi spoke resolutely.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but fall silent.
