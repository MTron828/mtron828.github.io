Chapter 1895: Soldiers At The City Wall

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On Star Land, the bloodbath continued.

Star Extermination Alliance behaved wantonly. Wherever they went was left barren. Whoever was related to Lineage of Star by a slight bit, unless they turned and fought Lineage of Star, they would be destroyed.

The terrifying bloodbath and massacre terrified countless people.

Such a bloodbath lasted for three months.

In three months, Star Land was flipped upside down. All Lineage of Star’s foundation in Star Land was destroyed. Nothing was left behind.

Star Land was occupied.

In a lofty palace, the heads of the five forces gathered.

“Lineage of Star could not tolerate this,” Number One Divine King from Divine King Island muttered.

“So what if they can’t tolerate it? Would they initiate a life-and-death battle with us like they did with Abysmal Palace back then?” Emperor God Tian Xiao sneered.

“Back then, Abysmal Palace was reckless. We never expected Lineage of Star to have so many Dao soldiers. Plus, Jian Wushuang’s power is extraordinary. Hence, we suffered a heavy defeat. But this time… Star Extermination Alliance gathers five top forces. Lineage of Star definitely won’t have the capital to match evenly. They are basically courting death if they charge out blindly,” Palace Master Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace said coldly.

“Even so, I never expected things to be so smooth. In just three months, we conquered Star Land. Next, we only have one last target,” Number One Divine King from Divine King Island’s gaze was cold.

They had already conquered Star Land entirely. It was said that Lineage of Star’s retreat route was taken.

Next, they naturally were going to the lair of Lineage of Star to kill all experts and disciples of Lineage of Star.

“This is our last step, and also an extremely important step. We definitely can’t be reckless. I suggest that our five forces immediately reorganize and consolidate our fighting powers. Then, we can charge to Lineage of Star altogether,” the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church said.

“Sure!”

“I agree!”

“If so, let’s depart now!”

On that day, also the day after Star Extermination Alliance had wiped out Star Land entirely, the experts from all five forces departed simultaneously.

The forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance were watching the war closely.

After a few days, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance arrived outside Universe Galaxy.

…

The vast Milky Way continued to float in silence in the void.

In front of the Milky Way, there were five spaceships floating. In front of the spaceships, there were many figures towering.

The figures gave out extremely strong aurae. They were all Almighties.

With naked eyes, one could see that there were almost seventy Almighties gathered in front of the spaceships.

Almighties, any one of them was the existence of an overlord. Seventy Almighties was such a terrifying number.

Also, it was only when the top five forces in Eternal Chaotic World teamed up that there would be such a powerful team formation.

Besides, among the seventy Almighties, there were ten aurae that obviously had already reached an even higher level.

Emperor Gods!

Ten Emperor Gods!

Averagely, every force sent out two Emperor Gods.

That was really shocking.

In the nearby Milky Way, there were many experts from different forces that had gathered and there weren’t very few.

To sum up, the formation was definitely not below Star Extermination Alliance but stronger.

The experts shared the same idea about Secret Skill of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. When the war started and Lineage of Star was destroyed, they would get a share of it.

However, the experts had never revealed themselves as of then.

In Universe Galaxy.

There were many experts from Lineage of Star that had gathered there and Jian Wushuang was naturally the leader.

As for Jian Yi and Qian Mingzi, they never revealed themselves.

The two fighting powers of Peak Emperor God, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t use them unless it reached a crucial moment, especially Jian Yi.

Jian Yi’s fighting power could easily challenge Underworld God. If he were to use him at crucial times, it would definitely turn around the situation entirely.

Qian Mingzi wasn’t weak as well. Most importantly, the outside world didn’t know about the two fighting power. Even in Lineage of Star, besides Jian Wushuang, only the other three Hall Masters knew.

The guest elders that had accepted their invitation didn’t know about the two of them as well.

Besides, the same applied to the Dao soldiers.

Jian Wushuang only took out thirty-four Dao soldiers.

Thirty bronze-armored Dao soldiers, four silver-armored Dao soldiers, and guest elders that were invited, those were the power that Lineage of Star put on display.

With such strength, there was a great distance if compared to Star Extermination Alliance.

“Seriously. Abysmal Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace, Divine King Island, Real Martial Arts Divine Church, Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, the five forces are going all out in this war!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Almost seventy Almghties and there are ten Emperor Gods among them. Such a team formation…”

“Too strong. The team formation is too strong. How are we going to withstand it?”

The guest elders in Lineage of Star began to worry.

It was inevitable. Their opponents’ team formation was too strong.

There was a total of ten Emperor Gods!

Peak Emperor Gods, they had four of them.

The four were Palace Master Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace, Number One Divine King from Divine King Island, the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church and also Emperor God Tian Xiao from Soaring Heaven King Palace!!

As for Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, they didn’t have any Peak Emperor Gods but they had three Emperor Gods and two of the three had come. The two Emperor Gods were extremely close to Peak Emperor God level too. When they teamed up, their fighting powers were almost strong enough to fight with a Peak Emperor God.

Jian Wushuang stood at the far front before all experts in Lineage of Star. He glanced at the four Peak Emperor Gods who were the most eye-catching among his opposition campsite.

Among the four, he had fought with Palace Master Wu Luo before.

As for the other three…

“Number One Divine King from Divine King Island?”

Jian Wushuang looked at a brawny, middle-aged man in crimson armor. The brawny, middle-aged man looked like a beast.

Number One Divine King from Divine King Island had gained fame earlier than the Master of Star Palace. He was on the thirty-third place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. His skills were scary.

The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church was an evil-looking elder.

The evil-looking elder was malicious but there was a dignified aura around him. He seemed to be upright but also evil at the same time.

The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church was on the twenty-eight place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

As for the last person…

“He is the strongest expert from Soaring Heaven King Palace, Emperor God Tian Ling?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock when he looked at the person.

He was a white-robed young man with snow-white hair.

There were no emotions in his cold, sharp glare. He didn’t even move an inch when his eyes met Jian Wushuang’s.

It was as though Jian Wushuang was merely air in his eyes!
