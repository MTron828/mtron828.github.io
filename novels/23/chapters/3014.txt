Chapter 3015: It Was Time for Him to Reveal Himself

——

The ten experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom did not doubt the blood-haired man’s identity. However, out of duty, the True Saint asked, “What is the name of that junior of yours? Where is he now?”

“He is called Xue Ling. He is an Earth Divine Master. He is currently in Heavenly Star City,” The blood-haired man said directly.

The True Saint from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom raised his brows.

Earth Divine Master…there were countless Earth Divine Master in the area they had sealed off. It was naturally impossible for him to know which one the blood-haired man was referring to.

“Forget it. You can enter, but before you do so, I have to remind you that this area has been completely sealed off by my Magic Note Divine Kingdom. You are only allowed to enter, and you are not allowed to leave. Once you enter, it’s impossible for you to leave for a short period of time,” The True Saint said.

“Oh?” The blood-haired man frowned. “Then how long will this place be sealed off for?”

“It shouldn’t be too long. A few years at best, a few hundred years at most,” said the True Saint.

“A few hundred years? That’s still fine.” The blood-haired man nodded slightly. Immediately, he followed the passageway and entered the sealed area.

The ten experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom did not suspect a thing from the beginning. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

…

After the blood-haired man entered the area, he continued forward.

However, the place he was heading to was not Heavenly Star City. Instead, he had arrived at a Grand Canyon that was a certain distance away from Heavenly Star City.

Upon arriving, the blood-haired man took out a token.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, I have arrived at the place you mentioned.” The blood-haired man sent a message.

“Wait a moment.” Another message came from the token.

The blood-haired man waited in the void of the valley for only a moment. Whoosh!

A figure rushed out from underground and appeared in front of the blood-haired man in the blink of an eye.

“Haha, Xue Dong King.”

Seeing the blood-haired man, Jian Wushuang immediately smiled.

Yes, it was Xue Dong King, who had a good relationship with Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Xue Dong King also smiled. The moment he saw Jian Wushuang, he immediately sensed his aura.

“Immortal Saint? and judging from his aura, he seems to be a True Saint?” Xue Dong King was stunned. “Brother Heavenly Marquis, have you made a breakthrough?”

“Yes, I just made a breakthrough,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Xue Dong King took a deep breath.

He knew very well that Jian Wushuang could fight a rank two True Saint before he made a breakthrough.

Now that he had made a breakthrough and become an Immortal Saint, and he had directly crossed the False Saint Realm to become a rank one True Saint, how strong was he?

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, I rushed here as soon as I received your message. I didn’t waste any time. I think I can still make it, right?” Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang with a faint smile.

“Yes, of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Xue Dong King, have you brought everything I asked you to bring me?”

“Yes.” Xue Dong King nodded and took out an interspatial ring. “There are 100 drops of the god-burning poison in this interspatial ring. I heard that you lost your special outfit, so I asked for one for you.”

Jian Wushuang took the interspatial ring and scanned it with his consciousness. The smile on his face grew wider.

“Xue Dong King, I asked you to get as much of the divine immolation venom as you could. I didn’t expect you to bring so much. It’s quite valuable,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course it’s not cheap.” The corner of Xue Dong King’s mouth twitched slightly as he said, “I have the authority of an Earth rank member to exchange for the ‘God Burning Poison’, but I need a total of 400,000 sacred elixirs to exchange for one drop. These 100 drops of ‘god-burning poison’ cost me a total of 40 million sacred elixirs!”

“40 million?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He was a heaven-level member, so when he exchanged for the god-burning venom from Lord Amasa, he only needed 300,000 sacred elixirs to exchange for one drop. He had exchanged for 50 drops before, which was only 15 million sacred elixirs.

But the same treasure, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance earth-level members and heaven-level members to exchange, is originally two different prices.

“You can afford 40 million sacred elixirs?” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Dong King with interest.

“Of course I can’t afford it.” Xue Dong King shook his head. “But you also know that I’ve been in the Barbarian King Team. You’ve taken care of our team before and we’ve benefited a lot. When our team found out that you needed the god-burning poison, we gathered together 40 million sacred elixirs so that I could bring you 100 drops of god-burning poison.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood and immediately said, “Xue Dong King, thank you for this time and Barbarian King Team. I’ll give you the 40 million sacred elixirs after we leave the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.”

“You’re welcome.” Xue Dong King waved his hand. “By the way, Brother Heavenly Marquis, why do you need so much god-burning poison? And the area where you are now is completely sealed off. I didn’t see many experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom on my way here. It seems that they are frantically searching for something. Those experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom have deliberately sealed off an area. Could it be you?”

“What do you think?” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Dong King with a smile.

“It’s really you? Oh my God!” It was the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Although I’ve never been here before, I’ve read the information before. The King of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom is a rank four True Saint, and there are many experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. There are hundreds of True Saint experts. Brother Heavenly Marquis, what did you do to make the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom chase after you?” Xue Dong King exclaimed.

“Well, I can’t explain it in a short time. Anyway, it’s true that many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom want to kill me.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but there was no fear in his words.

“Xue Dong King.” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Dong King again. “Anyway, this area has been completely sealed, so you can’t leave in a short time. Why don’t you stay and watch a good show?”

“A good show? What good show?” Xue Dong King asked.

“You don’t have to ask. You’ll know when the time comes. You don’t have to do anything. You just need to open your eyes wide and watch carefully,” Jian Wushuang said with a mysterious smile.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Xue Dong King became a little expectant.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and changed into a gray robe and a gray mask that were unique to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

His aura also became cold and dark. The corners of his mouth curled up with a cold smile. “Those experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom must be tired after searching for me for so long. Now, it’s time for me to show my face.”
