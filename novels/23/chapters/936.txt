Chapter 937: National Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Is such a life worth it just for the sake of a man?”

Emperor Leng’s cold voice reverberated in the air, her every word ringing loud and clear in Leng Rushuang’s head.

“Is it worth it?” Leng Rushuang muttered. Even so, her lips were curved into a smile. She then looked up at Emperor Leng. “The only hint of warmth I’ve ever felt in my life was when he healed me in the Ancient World!”

“You ask me if it’s worth it?”

“Of course!”

Her voice was as cold as ice and carried a never-before-seen determination. Her resolution was firmer than ever, as reflected in her eyes.

Whatever happened today, and regardless of what would happen in the future… she would never regret it!

“You idiot!” Emperor Leng continued to reprimand her daughter.

Emperor Xiao strangely didn’t say anything.

Jian Wushuang, who stood next to Leng Rushuang, was thoroughly stupefied.

Emperor Leng’s words were still ringing in his head.

“Once the Seal is released, Leng Rushuang will be endlessly tortured and live a life that is worse than death?”

“Gu King, what the hell is going on?”

“What’s going on?”

The surge of Jian Wushuang’s emotions was turbulent and violent.

“It’s a long story, so let’s that aside for the time being. Your little girlfriend really loves you, seeing as she’d break her Seal for you. If it’s possible to do so in the future, you should treat her kindly,” said Gu King.

“Easy for you to say.” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

On the battlefield, Emperor Leng looked coolly at her daughter. With a snort, she looked away and her gaze began roaming around.

When she saw the situation on the battlefield, she couldn’t help furrowing her brows.

Emperor Xiao had been well-prepared for their battle. Not only did he invite the Beiming Clan and a large number of solitary experts, Lord of Cercis Island and Master Blood Saber of Void Temple were also present. From the looks of it, his camp wasn’t any weaker than hers.

She noticed that Master Blood Saber was thoroughly crushing Xia Yu in their battle. Meanwhile, she was also at a disadvantage against Emperor Xiao because she had yet to recover from Jian Wushuang’s attack earlier.

To make things worse, Leng Rushuang had released her Seal and even used such a strange and frightening skill to kill a Rank Two Dao Master of the Xia Clan. She had thrown the power equilibrium of the two opposing camps off balance.

Her camp was at a disadvantage now. If Master Blood Saber killed Xia Yu or Leng Rushuang ended up slaughtering everyone, she would be completely defeated.

Emperor Leng suddenly looked up as she pondered this.

“National Master, look at the situation! Aren’t you going to make your move?”

“If you don’t make your move now, our many years of effort will be in vain!”

Her cold voice echoed through heaven and earth.

The Dao Masters on the battlefield as well as the spectating experts outside the imperial palace were stunned.

National Master?

The mysterious National Master from the Tang Kingdom of the Eastern Land?

“Hehe!”

The laughter seemed to contain a kind of magic power. The experts couldn’t stop themselves from looking toward the source of the laughter.

They watched as a slender figure appear next to Emperor Leng.

This person was dressed in an old gray robe and held a strip of cloth in his hand. On the cloth were the words: “Fortune Telling”.

He had gray hair and a wizened face. His eyes were so dark that they were unreadable and there seemed to be green flames burning behind his pupils.

His aura was so plain that he came off looking like an ordinary soothsayer in the market. However, those who recognized him knew that this ordinary-looking old geezer was terribly powerful.

Years ago, there had been a civil war in the Tang Kingdom of the Eastern Land.

Emperor Xiao had severed all ties with Emperor Leng and they waged a massive war against each other.

Emperor Xiao was superior to Emperor Leng both in terms of prestige and power in the Tang Kingdom but he still ended up tasting defeat.

There was only a reason for his defeat: the soothsayer.

“This is the mysterious National Master of the Tang Kingdom of the Eastern Land, the creator of Divine Sea and the Blood-eagle Amor?”?Jian Wushuang thought as he looked at the soothsayer.

He had heard of this National Master before.

Moreover, he had been quite stunned after learning about the National Master’s skills.

Divine Sea could crush experts below the level of Dao Masters. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

On the other hand, the Blood-eagle Armor not only possessed strong defensive capabilities, but it could also enhance the user’s offensive power. It was unlike anything that Jian Wushuang had ever seen in the Eternal World.

He was the creator of both skills.

Without his help, Emperor Leng wouldn’t have defeated Emperor Xiao.

“You finally showed up.”

Emperor Xiao’s expression turned grim at the sight of the soothsayer.

No one was more well-versed with the National Master’s skills than him, which was why he remained in fear of the latter.

The National Master was the only one out of the top experts of the Eternal World that he was afraid of.

“I didn’t plan on showing up so early. After all, your friend hasn’t shown up yet.” The soothsayer smiled.

“Friend?” Emperor Leng frowned.

She didn’t expect Emperor Xiao to still have reinforcements that had yet to appear.

“As expected of a person who could frighten Junior Brother Xiao. I thought I hid well but you still found me,” said an ethereal voice that came from outside the imperial palace.

The voice had clearly come from a faraway place but its owner had already appeared next to Emperor Xiao.

The gray-haired man was dressed in a white robe. Though he appeared to be an old man, the skin of his face was finer than most youngsters.

He looked at the soothsayer and Emperor Leng indifferently as if he was looking into the air.

He had an ethereal and incomparably unique temperament.

“It’s you, Emperor Yun!”

Emperor Leng’s pupils shrunk in fright.

Everyone else on the battlefield was also stunned.

Emperor Yun!

There had been four emperors in the golden age of the Tang Kingdom of the Eastern Land and Emperor Yun was ranked third among them. He had gone missing for years after Emperor Qing’s death but he had now shown himself again!
