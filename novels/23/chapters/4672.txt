4673 Besieging and Killing Devouring Emperor (1)

After seeing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked. The hundreds of black flags that appeared out of thin air were the Fengtian Flags that had been lost in the Void Universe!

However, the Fengtian Flags were no longer only effective against the Void Universe. Each of them was like a formation eye of a mighty formation, firmly fixed in the void and sealing all the Supreme experts from the Divine Power Universe.

Jian Wushuang did not know what kind of secret technique the Devouring Emperor had used to make the Fengtian Flag of the Divine Power Universe his own, but he knew that they were in trouble.

Once the Fengtian Flag fell into the void, it cut off their connection with the universe and the divine power in their bodies could no longer be derived.

Jian Wushuang waved his arm and the unparalleled divine power of the Ancestor realm blasted at the endless Fengtian Formation, but it did not move at all.

Devouring Emperor sneered and said, “You think you can break the Fengtian Great Formation? All of you, die!”

With that, Devouring Emperor, who was also in the Fengtian Great Formation, released a power that exceeded the Laws of the Great Dao against the entire army of the Divine Power Universe.

The void shattered. Only Ancestor realm experts could withstand such terrifying energy!

All kinds of divine skills came one after another. Jian Wushuang released the Ancestral Skill and slashed out the Sword Dao River at the same time!

However, the power that exceeded the rules of the Great Dao easily destroyed the Transcendence Heavenly Gate. Even the long river of Sword Dao only stopped it for a moment before it was completely destroyed.

The terrifying power was getting closer and closer to Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

However, Old Master made his move next. He extended his hand to block the attack, causing endless Black Water ripples to appear.

The two attacks collided, creating an extremely dull explosion that numbed all the Supreme experts’ limbs and made their hearts beat wildly.

The unimaginably terrifying energy slowly dissipated and Jian Wushuang’s face turned grave.

He could feel that Devouring Emperor had become stronger and had become an existence that had transcended rules and Laws.

Without any pause, Devouring Emperor locked onto Jian Wushuang and released an even more terrifying energy.

However, in the next moment, Old Master stood in front of him and held Devouring Emperor in place.

As Devouring Emperor attacked, the ten or so members of the Devourers also joined the battle. Each of them had the terrifying power of a Half Ancestor.

After nodding slightly at Supreme Xue Bo and the others, Jian Wushuang leaped forward to meet Devour One.

“We meet again.” A strange and deep voice came out of Devour One’s mouth, and it looked at Jian Wushuang with his scarlet eyes.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. Devour Oone gave him a very strange feeling, as if he was a semi-finished product that was randomly pieced together with a pile of parts. Whether it was his speech or his movements, they were extremely stiff.

A puppet with strings. This was the most direct feeling Jian Wushuang had.

“Is Devour One no longer the same person?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. Then, he raised the Tarot Divine Sword and slashed at Devour One.

A strange scene appeared. Devour One did not dodge at all, and the vast Sword Intent directly twisted him into countless pieces.

But then, several small black holes appeared in the void, and Devour One’s body, which was already broken, slowly reappeared.

“You can’t kill me,” Devour One said in a strange way and then raised his palm to bombard Jian Wushuang with terrifying power.

Jian Wushuang did not think too highly of himself and immediately released the second move of the Transcendence Heavenly Gate, the Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate.

The divine light as bright as the sun rose, and the purest attack crushed toward Devour One.

The divine light flickered for a moment, and his entire body turned into dust again under this attack.

Jian Wushuang did not relax at all when he saw Devour One disappear completely. He looked ahead with a slight frown.

Then, as if sand had gathered to form a tower, Devour One, who had been turned into dust, reappeared.

Without a sound, the two figures collided heavily. The power of the Ancestor realm collided, and a wail of the Great Dao was heard.

Jian Wushuang cut off Devour One’s head, but it grew back after a few seconds, which confused him.

He could feel that although he could severely injure Devour One, he still could not hurt his life force.

On the contrary, every time Devour One attacked, he left ineffable damage on Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Jian Wushuang only realized something after he had cut his divine body almost a hundred times.

“Is it possible that this Devour One has always been the True Shadow of the Devouring Emperor?”

With an attitude of giving it a try, Jian Wushuang cut it into two with one stroke of his sword and reached out to hold the life source of Devour One.

Devouring Emperor, who was fighting with Old Master, trembled. He looked at Jian Wushuang and shouted angrily, “How dare you?!”

At the same time, a great light swept toward him. Jian Wushuang sneered and took advantage of this critical moment to take the life source of Devour One into his hand.

This time, Devour One’s strange body could not be condensed again.

“Jian Wushuang, you deserve to die!” Emperor Devourer, who had been calm and majestic, no longer cared. He pushed Old Master away with one palm and went straight for Jian Wushuang.

The unparalleled energy that was as deep as the abyss seemed to have swallowed the entire universe. Even Jian Wushuang, who had reached the Ancestor realm, felt the great horror of life and death!

If he faced this attack directly, the best result would be a serious injury!

It was already too late for Old Master to rush to his aid.

At this critical moment, Jian Wushuang threw out the Lu Ding clay idol’s life source almost instinctively.

The life source of the Lu Ding clay idol was exposed in the void, and the clay idol could not wait to drill out of the Nailstone.

“Jian Wushuang, I want you dead!” the clay idol of Lu Ding shouted in anger. However, before he could do anything, he felt like he was being stabbed in the back.

He turned around slowly, and in the next moment, he was devoured by the terrifying energy of Devouring Emperor.

It was as if billions of suns had exploded within the entire great Fengtian Formation, and the vast shock waves directly tore the great Fengtian Formation to pieces.

Thanks to the ‘sacrifice’ of Lu Ding’s clay idol, Jian Wushuang and the Supreme cultivator army behind him were unharmed. However, tens of thousands of Six Scar Void Masters were killed by this indiscriminate attack.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang looked at the void.

The indestructible Lu Ding clay idol did not have a trace of his life source after taking on this attack…

Devouring Emperor was furious. His long hair fell from his crown, and he looked like a mad demon.

Jian Wushuang felt the Ancestor realm life source in his hand and finally understood that it was Devouring Emperor’s clay idol True Shadow.

After being sealed in the Nailstone, the energy flowing around Devouring Emperor’s body also weakened slightly.

After a long while, the enraged Devouring Emperor calmed down and said gloomily, “Return that life source to me. I will no longer interfere with the life and death of the Void Universe.”

Old Master floated to Jian Wushuang’s side and said softly, “If you want to go back, you’ll have to go through me first.”

The atmosphere was strange and deathly silent. Devouring Emperor suppressed the anger in his heart. “Do you really want to fight to the death?!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It wasn’t my Divine Power Universe that wanted to fight to the death. It was you, the Devourers!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.
