Chapter 229: Purple Crystal Lake

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How are you feeling?” Jin Ling and Mu Shan rushed over to take a look.

With a tint of regret, Jian Wushuang sighed, “Not bad, but it’s a pity that the time is so short.”

Indeed, it was only a month’s time, way too short.

He was too engrossed in the meditation of the Rainstorm Picture and had already long forgotten that time existed. He felt like he was only inside for a short while, but a month had passed just like that.

Curiosity brought Mu Shan to ask, “Surely your skills have improved by a lot?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Although the meditation only lasted for a month, he was able to understand the sword light and sword essence of the Origin even deeper from the raindrops. It elevated his skills in World Origin and Slaughter Origin.

He even mastered the fourth and fifth moves of the Selfless Sword Technique. It seemed like it would not be long before he mastered the sixth one as well.

He has also mastered the first move of the Blood Emptying Technique.

That all happened within a month only.

If he did not close himself away from the world, it would have taken him more than half a year to master the fourth and fifth moves of the Selfless Sword Technique completely.

It was even more amazing that he managed to get the hang of the first move of the Blood Emptying Technique so quickly. It was meant to take ages for one to comprehend, but he managed to do it within a month, thanks to the Rainstorm Picture.

“Staying in the Rainstorm Palace for a month has helped me to understand the Origin and master my swordsmanship greatly,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jin Ling replied, “The Rainstorm Palace was your second opportunity. Now, your third opportunity is here, and that’s the Purple Crystal Lake.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Purple Crystal Lake?” Jian Wushuang repeated with a tint of expectation.

He did not know what this Purple Crystal Lake was all about, but from what he had gathered during his stay at the Rainstorm Palace, he can be certain that this lake was like none other. At least, it would be of huge benefit to him.

Jin Ling glanced at Mu Shan and ordered. “Mu Shan, you bring him there.”

“Yes.” Mu Shan nodded upon his orders and proceeded to lead the way.

Under Mu Shan’s guidance, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of a purple lake.

The lake is neither big nor small; the water is as clear as crystal, emitting a faint fragrance. It was like a good old wine, waiting to lure others into its beauty.

“This is the Purple Crystal Lake,” Mu Shan said, “this lake is made from Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.”

“Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was broken and he had a dumbstruck expression.

Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid had characteristics similar to the Primordial Spiritual Liquid. They were both the purest energy sources in the mortal world.

What was different was that the Primordial Spiritual Liquid only works for the beginner warriors in the Spirit Path and Level of Transforming Sea. On the other hand, the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid was greatly beneficial even to the experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

In fact, there were many experts in the Ying-Yang Void Realm that transacts using Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid instead of wealth.

In the Tianzong Dynasty, an expert of the Initial Yin Void Realm whose value was worth 100 drops of the liquid was considered impressive.

But right now, what was with this lake full of the powerful liquid?

Amazed, Jian Wushuang proclaimed, “I’m sure all of the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid in the Tianzong Dynasty combined would not make up even a 10th of this lake?”

Mu Shan replied, “Jian Wushuang, you can cultivate at the lake for two months. During this period, you can do whatever you want with the liquid. Two months later, I hope your realm can greatly improve.” Mu Shan took a glance at Jian Wushuang and walked away.

Jian Wushuang was left alone by the Purple Crystal Lake.

“Two months?”

“I can cultivate as I like for two months?”

There was a glow of excitement in his eyes, and he jumped in without hesitation.

Plop!

Jian Wushuang had landed in the lake. His head resurfaced above the waters and he eyed his surroundings.

“Let me see how much I can gain from a huge lake like this in two months?” Jian Wushuang summoned his Heavenly Creation Skill immediately without hesitation.

While the effects took place, the waters of the lake stirred like a tornado.

The waves were raging wildly while Jian Wushuang remained on the water surface. A tremendous force that swallowed from within arose and the Purple Crystal Liquid gushed into his body at the speed of lightning.

This is the furthest the Heavenly Creation skill could do!

Crazy swallow!

Taking in everything!

The Spiritual Power inside him started to rise at a puzzling speed.

After sending Jian Wushuang to the Purple Crystal Lake, Mu Shan left and came back to Jin Ling.

“I have already sent him to the lake,” Mu Shan said.

“OK,” Jin Ling nodded and continued, “two months is not long, neither is it short. I wonder how much his Cultivation of Spiritual Power can improve by then.”

“He has already reached Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Although it happened not long ago, as long as he absorbs the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid as much as he can, then the Initial Yin Void Realm is not far away. If he is lucky, he might just reach the Profound Yin Void Realm!” Mu Shan said.

“Profound Yin Void Realm?” Jin Ling frowned and said, “I remember Jian Nantian also cultivated at the Purple Crystal Lake for two months before hitting Initial Yin Void Realm. He even hit the peak, falling short of the Profound Yin Void Realm by a tiny bit.”

“This fella is even more outstanding than his father, being able to break through the Completion of the Yin Void Realm. He has a lot of potentials.”

Jin Ling and Mu Shan were busily engrossed in their discussion and were oblivious to whatever was happening in the lake.

If they were to take a look at what was happening, they would want to take back their words, because the Purple Crystal Lake had gone haywire completely.

Jian Wushuang had unleashed his Heavenly Creation Skill to its extreme, and the wolfing speed was unbelievably fast.

After all, he had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill!

It was just like back in the days when he was still on the Divine Path Level, drawing power from the Primordial Spiritual Liquid at Nine-wolves Mountain. He was doing it at a speed much faster than any other normal warrior.

A regular elixir that raises Spiritual Power needs a couple of months to be completely digested, but Jian Wushuang only needs a day!

Naturally, the speed at which he was harnessing the liquid would be noticeably faster than normal people’s.

This was the Heavenly Creation Skill, a cultivation method that was against the natural order.

Both Jin Ling and Mu Shan agreed that Jian Wushuang would surely reach the Initial Yin Void Realm in his two months at Purple Crystal Lake. They were even hopeful that he can reach the Profound Yin Void Realm.

But in reality?

On the third day!

By the third day of his cultivation, Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power in his Gold Core has reached its extreme. After harnessing enough power, he tried to make a breakthrough to the Yin Void Realm directly.

With such a powerful liquid as his foundation, Jian Wushuang seemed confident.

He did not require any external help and went straight ahead with the majestic Spiritual Power stored in him.

He succeeded.

By his third day of cultivation, he reached the Initial Yin Void Realm. After that, he continued to gain strength. By the 10th day, he once again outdid himself and reached the Profound Yin Void Realm!

In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.
