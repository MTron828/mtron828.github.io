Chapter 1539: Six People

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“One thousand nine hundred and eighty years?” The purple-armored man was shocked and he gasped in admiration: “I only walked for less than eight hundred years on that Void Corridor before being sent out as I could no longer take it. However, you actually walked for over a thousand years more than me. This is really impressive.”

The time in a phantasmagoria and in reality was different.

The purple-armored man had walked for close to eight hundred years on the Void Corridor. However, in reality, that was only over two hours’ time.

“Before even achieving two thousand years, I gave up. This is considered nothing. The people who are still in the phantasmagoria are the ones who are amazing,” the white-bearded old man said.

“Indeed,” the purple-armored man also nodded his head and he looked around the area.

At the very moment, there was less than a thousand people who were still in the Void Corridor and had yet to wake up.

These people had probably been walking in the corridor for more than a thousand years.

For two thousand years, they must continue to stay true to their own objectives and continue walking dutifully. However, this was something that even many Real Gods could not do. As for the Universe Gods who were still in the phantasmagoria, discounting their abilities, they were not weak mentally.

In the blink of an eye, another day passed.

Originally, there were still over thousands of Universe Gods remaining on the Void Corridor. However, this number had been reduced to forty!

At that moment, these forty people had been walking for more than five thousand years in the black corridor.

In the open space, all the Universe Gods who had awakened were surrounding and observing the remaining forty people.

At that moment, among the forty people, the eyelids of one of the figures moved and opened his eyes after that.

“Oh, it’s Zi Dongwang?”

“Haha, Zi Dongwang has woken up as well.”

“Hehe, although he is the fourth in the Universe God ranking list, his mind is not very strong, is it?”

A number of Universe Gods who had woken up a long time ago sneered secretly.

After Zi Dongwang woke up and got to know the details of the situation, his expression became unusually ugly.

“Damn it. When solving the Scattered Stars Game previously, forget the fact that I was behind over sixty people. However, for this third test, which is a test targeted at the mind, there are actually over forty people who are above me? How can this be possible?”

“This is impossible!”

Zi Dongwang was roaring madly inside his own mind and he felt extremely dissatisfied.

However, the top experts outside the cave were not surprised by Zi Dongwang’s performance in the third test at all.

“Although Zi Dongwang’s abilities are not too bad, his mind is actually not very strong?”

“For him to stay five thousand years in the Void Corridor, it is already considered decent. However, it is far from enough to tally with the fact that he is ranked fourth on the Universe God ranking list.”

“Ignore Zi Dongwang. I am really very curious about the remaining people. Let’s see who will have the last laugh.”

The experts in the big hall were all waiting in anticipation.

Time passed by gradually.

Universe Gods who could no longer take the dullness of walking for years woke up in succession.

Another day passed. Out of the hundred thousand Universe Gods who were at the third level of the cave, there were only six people remaining in the Void Corridor!

These six people were the God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang, Xin Zhu, Tian Can and Universe God Xia Hou.

There was nothing that could be said about the God Destroying King. His abilities had been recognized as the best. Moreover, his abilities were cultivated from going through massacres for many years. Hence, he had experienced many hardships and killings. With that, he managed to develop an iron-like mind and such a mind would naturally be in the top few among the Universe Gods.

As for Duan Lingfeng, he was a person who was as cold as ice. Just like Jian Wushuang, he had grown up facing hardships such as countless killings and tragedies. Hence, his willpower was as sturdy as an ice mountain. As soon as he set his mind on something, it would be almost impossible to change it.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was an Inverse Cultivator. Not only had he gone through numerous trainings, he had also experienced two Inverse Cultivation Tests. The most noteworthy one was the Reincarnation Test which caused his mind to achieve a fantastic level. Among the three levels of the mind, he belonged to the first level at the very moment. At the first level, he had managed to understand his own mind and nature clearly. With that, he could make decisions based on these understandings. Such a feat was considered being at the peak of the first level and he was very close to the second level. When he entered the Void Corridor, he made up his mind based on his own understandings. After determining that the light was the exit, he would continue walking there without hesitation as he trusted his own mind completely and persistently.

As for Xin Zhu, before Jian Wushuang rose up to his current position, he was recognized as number one in consciousness attacks out of the Universe Gods. Since consciousness was linked to the mind most of the time, he would usually train his mind at the same time as he trained his consciousness. Therefore, his mind was also very strong.

As for Tian Can, he was an expert who rose up quickly during the fight for the White Blaze Fruit at the second level of the cave. Since he got famous from killing people, he was most likely a cold-blooded person. As such, he had a strong mind and would not change his decision easily.

These five people who were just mentioned above were top experts of the Universe God ranking list. Moreover, they were within the top ten of the Universe God ranking list.

However, out of the five of them, there was still one person remaining.

Universe God Xia Hou was an ugly-looking middle-aged man. His abilities were normal and he had only reached Peak Universe God of the Third Heaven.

Disregarding the comparison of him with the experts of the Universe God ranking list, even a random top Universe God of the Third Heaven from the open space could push him back easily.

He did not have any special abilities as well. Before this test, he was a nobody and had no reputation. Moreover, not a single person paid attention to him. However, at the moment, in the third test, Universe God Xia Hou who was an extremely ordinary person, had actually walked with the five great experts, namely the God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang, Xin Zhu and Tian Zhu, to the very end!

At that moment, he actually stood side by side with the five great experts.

This was something that had never crossed anyone’s mind.

Amidst the vast hall, at the very moment, many Almighties and Real Gods from various big powerhouses had very puzzled expressions.

Most of them had lost the right to fight for the White Blaze Fruit tree. After all, the Universe Gods under them had been disqualified from the third test.

However, the Universe Gods under some of them were still not disqualified yet.

“Haha, it’s Xia Hou, it’s Universe God Xia Hou, who my Water Moon Pavilion hired,” a small, short black-haired old man laughed wantonly and his laughter reverberated across the big hall.

The Almighties in the big hall could not help but look toward the black-haired old man.

“Hei Hun, are you saying that Universe God Xia Hou is under the Water Moon Pavilion? How could I have not heard of him before?” a strong man with a tough, stocky build questioned in a low voice.

The Water Moon Pavilion and the powerhouse that the man belonged to were both on the same piece of land in one of the Sanctuaries. As both powerhouses were competing with each other fiercely, they naturally knew each other inside-out.

“Of course you would not know. Universe God Xia Hou is not a disciple of the Water Moon Pavilion. In order to save his wife, who has been poisoned, he looked for the Water Moon Pavilion. He then requested for a Real God expert who was proficient in making elixirs to make an elixir to save his wife.”

“However, it’s a pity that his abilities were only normal and he also did not have any treasures. As such, he could not exchange anything for the elixir. However, at that time, Wu Bei’s cave appeared. Hence, that Real God of my Water Moon Pavilion decided to try his luck and sent him over.”
