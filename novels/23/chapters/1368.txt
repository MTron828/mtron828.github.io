Chapter 1369: Catch the Meta Beast

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After saying goodbye to Qu Yang, Jian Wushuang went to the Star River.

He was searching for Meta Beasts.

“There’s one.”

Jian Wushuang soon found a Meta Beast, but it was tiny.

The beast was just half a meter tall. Obviously, its energy had been absorbed by disciples in the Lineage of Star and the beast hadn’t recovered. Jian Wushuang wouldn’t get enough energy by capturing it.

A useful Meta Beast should be at least one to two meters tall.

“Go on!”

Jian Wushuang continued searching.

The Star River was vast. Jian Wushuang couldn’t go through the whole river in only one month.

After an hour, Jian Wushuang had found another one.

This one was almost three meters tall.

“There you go!”

Jian Wushuang approached the beast quietly.

But, as he approached, the beast detected him and turned around, staring at him.

This Meta Beast was born in the Star River a long time ago. It had been captured by disciples in the Lineage of Star multiple times, knowing how dangerous its predators were. As soon as it saw Jian Wushuang, it immediately ran away.

It ran so fast, like a flash.

“You can’t escape!”

Jian Wushuang followed it.

Whoosh!

He and the beast rushed quickly through the Star River.

Jian Wushuang was surprised about the beast’s speed.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t catch up with it even though he had tried his best.

“It’s time for me to use some tools.”

Jian Wushuang then used his consciousness to generate his Blaze Quicksand Gourd, from which a tremendous amount of sand rushed out.

The rushing speed of the sand was way faster than the running beast. Soon those sands covered the beast and lowered its speed. In that way, Jian Wushuang narrowed the distance with the beast.

Soon, he caught up with the beast.

Jian Wushuang said delightedly to the beast, “I will not kill you. Just give your energy to me.”

The beast seemed to understand what Jian Wushuang said. It turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang with great hostility.

Beasts born in the Star River were docile. But they would become aggressive when faced with danger.

Especially after being caught by humans several times.

The beast roared.

The beast stopped running and rushed to Jian Wushuang.

It raised its front feet and intended to attack Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang hit the beast with his fists instead of using the Blood Mountain Sword in order not to injure it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Bang!

After an explosion, the Star River around them went dark.

Jian Wushuang was blasted out.

It took him to while to stand stably.

He was shocked by the power of the beast.

“What happened?”

While Jian Wushuang was blasted out, the Meta Beast was not injured at all.

He had failed to pass even the first level of the Star Tower. He had felt better for the simple reason that he was regarded as a Universe God in the Second Heaven, but now he had even failed to catch a Meta Beast?

Even a beast was more powerful than him?!

“I once saw a Universe God catch a Meta Beast easily so I have always thought that it would just be a piece of cake for me to catch one too. But…”

The Meta Beast was also shocked.

It had always believed that humans were so powerful.

But this time, the predator seemed weak.

“I want to try again!”

Jian Wushuang rushed to the beast again.

And the beast also rushed to him.

They were going to collide and battle again.

But at that very moment…

Two figures came. A man and a woman.

The man was slightly fat and the woman was the one that Jian Wushuang had seen catch a three-meter Meta Beast easily before.

“How many beasts have you caught?” The man asked the woman.

“Twelve. And you?”

“Roughly the same as you.” The man smiled, “I will go back after catching several more.”

“So will I.” The woman said.

As they were talking, they heard a bombing sound.

“What is that?”

“That bombing sound only exists when two people are fighting together. Who dares fight in Star Land?” The man frowned.

“Let us go and have a look.” The woman said.

As they went to where the sound was coming from, they saw Jian Wushuang and the beast.
