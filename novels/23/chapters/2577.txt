Chapter 2578: San Shouwang Is Dead

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Star Picking Pavilion Auction? Eleven years later?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

Jian Wushuang knew that San Shouwang did not lie or rather dared not lie.

“Jian Yi, I’ve already told you everything I know and there’s no enmity between us, why don’t you...” Jian Wushuang who was in front of him had already swung out his long sword before San Shouwang could finish his words.

A cold sword-light swept toward San Shouwang.

Under the huge divine aura pressure, San Shouwang could not move or resist the attack!

“No!”

“Jian Yi, my eldest brother is the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief. He’ll avenge me!”

San Shouwang only had time to let out a terrible scream before his head was cut off and tossed away.

Jian Wushuang wore a cold and indifferent expression as he slowly sheathed the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand into its scabbard. The 1,800-feet-high Golden God Shadow behind him began to slowly subside. The Golden Prison that had completely enveloped the void had also begun to fade.

The experts of various clans as well as the countless cultivators who gathered around to watch the battle were still waiting around the Combat Ring.

Finally, the Golden Prison which was suspended in the center receded.

Countless pairs of eyes instantly stared at the center of the receding golden prison.

The situation inside the prison soon unfolded as they saw the two figures within.

One of them stood still whereas the other was suspended in the void—his head no longer attached to his body.

The identity of the person who lost his head was instantly confirmed.

It was San Shouwang!

For a moment, the entire Combat Ring fell into dead silence.

It was so absolutely quiet and soundless.

Jian Wushuang took away San Shouwang’s Interspatial Ring and the other treasures on his body under everyone’s gaze before slowly walking toward the void beside him.

He walked up toward the two Official Army commanders.

“Do you still want to fight?” Jian Wushuang coldly asked.

The soldiers under both commanders were taken aback when they heard Jian Wushuang. One of the commanders even walked up to Jian Wushuang and respectfully said, “Master, there’s a set of rules the Official Army have to follow. We won’t interfere in challenges issued via the normal channels against the Territorial Lord. Other than that, the Official Army will have to obey the Territorial Lord’s orders just like what happened earlier. Please forgive us.”

The commander was very worried at the moment.

Although they were just following the Official Army’s rules, they did indeed attack Jian Wushuang.

After San Shouwang was killed, there was nothing they could do to save themselves had Jian Wushuang wanted to vent his anger on the Official Army.

“I don’t blame you since you were acting according to the rules. However, now that I’ve killed San Shouwang, can I become the new Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Err...” the commander frowned and said, “Master, there is no problem at all for you to be the next Territorial Lord with your strength. However, there are still a few procedures to be completed. If you are convenient now, you can come with me to the Territorial Lord Mansion. Us, commanders will assemble to meet you before carefully explaining the procedures.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and immediately called out at the void next to him, “Xin’er.”

A beautiful woman with an alluring figure and valiant look who wore purple battle armor came to Jian Wushuang’s side from the void in the distance.

“Master,” Xiao Tiexin greeted Jian Wushuang with her slightly blood-red eyes as her figure trembled slightly from evident agitation.

She had taken off her disguise and exposed her true identity to the public.

“Come with me to the Territorial Lord Mansion,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin was very docile.

Both commanders and their many soldiers soon led Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin toward the Territorial Lord Mansion.

After Jian Wushuang was gone quite far away, the Combat Ring broke into a state of tumultuous!

“He’s dead. The Territorial Lord is dead?”

“The strongest expert in Northern Darkstar Territory is killed?”

“Territorial Lord? The strongest expert? I say there’s always someone better and Jian Yi has replaced him now since he killed him. Our Territorial Lord is Jian Yi from today onward instead of San Shouwang. The strongest expert now is of course also Jian Yi!”

“That’s right! San Shouwang is now dead so Jian Yi is stronger than him!”

“Northern Darkstar Territory’s leader is finally changing!”

Countless cultivators were exclaiming excitedly.

San Shouwang had always been invincible in Northern Darkstar Territory for a long time.

He was unrivaled and had a high status with many clans in Northern Darkstar Territory dared not compete against San Shouwang at all.

San Shuwang was a real despot.

Many people in Northern Darkstar Territory once thought that there might be a stronger expert who could defeat San Shouwang and replace him as the Territorial Lord. However, the last four consecutive challengers had failed miserably which made them lose hope since the chances were slim. Even if there was a chance, it might only probably happen many years later.

No one could have thought that someone would challenge San Shouwang again in less than two years after Pei Qi’s challenge and successfully cut his head off. The most important matter was that person’s strength was only at the Peak Ultimate God!

“Jian Yi!”

“Jian Yi!”

Countless cultivators on the Combat Ring were chanting his name. From that day onward, Jian Yi had become the new hero of Northern Darkstar Territory—the new strongest expert!

The various clans’ members wore very complicated expressions on their faces while countless cultivators were still cheering.

Before the battle, they were attracted to the scene by the Heavenly Treasure Armor on Jian Wushuang.

Especially the Shi Clan, they were the ones who disseminated the news about Jian Wushuang’s Heavenly Treasure Armor.

The Shi Clan had battled with Jian Wushuang before and were rather unhappy that they did not manage to keep Jian Wushuang.

However...

Shi Qianhan, the Shi Clan Leader and the Shi Clan Elders stood there motionless with Shi Qianhan’s complexion almost chalk white.

“Clan Leader...” An elder next to him whispered.

“Shut up, let’s go back first!” Shi Qianhan gave an order in a low voice and immediately led his people away.

In another void, the situation with the Situ Clan was the complete opposite of the Shi Clan.

“He’s dead. San Shouwang is finally dead!”

“That’s great. It’s really great!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“We won the bet. Situ Clan had won the big bet this time and Jian Yi did not disappoint us!”

The Situ Clan elders were overjoyed!

Situ Yuan was shivering as his eyes glowed with happiness but quickly got back to his senses. He took out a Message Token and sent a message. “Second Elder, bring our people back. Situ Clan is safe now!”
