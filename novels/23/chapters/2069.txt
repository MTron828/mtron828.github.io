2070 Within Luo King City

“So what about you guys? Are the rest of you going to invite me as well?” Jian Wushuang said coldly as he scanned the remaining ten Ancient Gods.

The remaining ten Ancient Gods who had seven or eight stars looked at Jian Wushuang in awe and disbelief.

They lowered their heads upon hearing his question.

Even someone with the power level of King Zhan Cang could be defeated easily by Jian Wushuang. They would not risk their lives and anger Jian Wushuang.

“Since no one is going to invite me, get lost,” Jian Wushuang raged.

The Ancient Gods stepped aside immediately and made a path.

“King Gu You and King Gu Tong, let us continue our journey,” Jian Wushuang looked at the two of them and said.

At that point in time, King Gu You and King Gu Tong were shocked beyond words.

King Gu Tong doubted that Jian Wushuang could fend off a Nine-star Ancient God even when Jian Wushuang himself said that he could.

But now... Jian Wushuang had crushed a Nine-star Ancient Emperor with a single technique. Even King Luo Yu could not have achieved this feat.

Besides feeling surprised, they were euphoric.

This was their true Emperor: he had both insane power and strong bloodline power.

“Let’s go!”

The three of them made their way towards Luo King City.

Within the large ditch, King Zhan Cang stood up after a while. By then, Jian Wushuang and the other two men were already far away.

...

After half a month, Jian Wushuang reached Luo King City under the guidance of the two kings.

“Sword Emperor, this is Luo King City. The experts form Luo Clan, Gu Clan and many other clans are gathered here. However, Luo King City is barricaded by the men under King Chen Xing. My brother and I put in a lot of effort just to get out to welcome you,” King Gu You said.

“Barricaded? Looks like you are at a complete disadvantage in this fight.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said.

King Gu You sighed and continued, “I have messaged King Luo Yu and ask for his aid to bring us into the city.”

“We should send a message to King Luo Yu to inform him that we are arriving. However, we do not need his aid. We will make our way in by ourselves,” Jian Wushuang said as he rushed towards the city.

“Entering by force?” King Gu You was stunned for a moment. Then, he recalled the fighting power of Jian Wushuang and understood how.

Before long, violent roars and clashes could be heard.

The trio had fought the experts under the command of King Chen Xing.

However, under the ruthless attacks, the experts lost to Jian Wushuang. The trio broke past the barricade easily and appeared in front of the city.

King Luo Yu, numerous Seven-star Ancient Gods and Eight-star Ancient Gods stood there waiting for the arrival of Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor,” King Luo Yu greeted respectfully. He walked up as soon as he saw Jian Wushuang in the distance.

“King Luo Yu, how have you been?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The remaining Ancient Gods that were standing behind King Luo Yu looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

They knew his identity as King Luo Yu had told them earlier that Jian Wushuang possessed bloodline of emperors and that they should support him in becoming their new master.

Aside from King Gu Tong, King Gu You and a few others, no one had met Jian Wushuang before, much less confirmed the bloodline power others claimed he had. They were unsure if the claims were true.

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly when he saw that everyone doubted him. The aura of the bloodline power of the Ancient Clan burst forth.

“This aura…” All the Ancient Gods were startled.

“The aura of an emperor. This is definitely the bloodline power of an emperor!!”

“Haha. This certainly is the bloodline power of an emperor. Looks like King Luo Yu was right, there is indeed someone with the bloodline of emperors. How dare this King Chen Xing vow that we are traitors. I want to see what he has to say after the message that the bloodline of emperor exists spreads!”

All the Ancient Gods looked at Jian Wushuang in excitement.

King Luo Yu smiled when he saw the changes in expressions. He said “Sword Emperor, please enter the city. We can continue the conversation inside.”

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Under the personal guidance of King Luo Yu, Jian Wushuang entered Luo King City.

There were many Seven and Eight-stars Ancient Gods seated within the large, magnificent palace.

At the top of the palace there were two thrones side by side. Jian Wushuang sat on one beside King Luo Yu.

“King Luo Yu, what’s happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“After I confirmed that you, Sword Emperor, have the bloodline of emperors back in Green Fire World, i came back to Ancient God Sanctuary immediately. I gathered the different clan leaders and the masters of various king cities to come together to support you as our new emperor,” King Luo Yu started explaining.

“In the history of our clan, bloodline power is supreme. Since you possess the bloodline power of emperors, you should become our new emperor. However, during the gathering, King Chen Xing questioned this. He said that your blood is mixed with that of a human, so you do not deserve to be our new emperor. He further accused that my Tuo Clan conspired with the humans and are traitors to the Ancient God Clan!”

“Hence, during the meeting, I fell out with King Chen Xing. Out of all the different clan leaders and masters of king cities, only thirty percent of them sided with me. However, forty percent sided with King Chen Xing.”

“Forty percent? I thought that bloodline power is supreme within the Ancient God Clan? Why do forty percent of the experts support King Chen Xing? And what happened to the other thirty percent?” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows and asked.

“It is indeed true that bloodline power is supreme in our clan. However, some people felt it unfair that you possess the bloodline power of emperor, while others had not seen you with their own eyes. Most importantly, the influence of King Chen Xing is too strong in the Ancient God Clan,” King Luo Yu sighed.

“King Chen Xing is the oldest and most senior within the clan. He is also the strongest person. There was no one born with the bloodline of emperors till this date. Hence, he is always the leader in our clan. He plays an important role in deciding the masters of different king cities in the fight against the other three top tier clans as well as resolving clashes with other special tribes.”

“Furthermore, he is the direct royal bloodline of first Ancient God Emperor!”

“Direct royal bloodline?” Jian Wushuang was stunned before he continued, “You mean…”

“Yes, his father is Ancient God Emperor.” King Luo Yi said seriously.
