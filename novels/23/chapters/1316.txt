Chapter 1317: Spared No Efforts!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Boom!

Three Sacred Thunders had shot down from the heavens one after another. However, the huge thundercloud showed no signs of dissipating. Instead, it began to slowly form the next Sacred Thunder.

“Another one?”

“How come?”

“This is impossible!”

All cried out in astonishment.

Even the experienced Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang had never seen many cases.

Why would only a Universe Master have to continuously receive more than six horrible Sacred Thunders just in his first part of the God Test?

“The seven Sacred Thunders?”

“It is definitely an unusual God Test!”

Bang!

Under the gaze of all, the Thundercloud shot a brand new Sacred Thunder again.

And after seeing the seventh Sacred Thunder, everyone’s eyes were wide open.

It was also of crimson color, but different from the last one, this crimson Sacred Thunder was accompanied by a stream of green fire.

That small fire scared everyone. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s a Fire Test!”

“Oh my goodness!”

The crowd cried out.

Jian Wushuang was also alarmed.

He couldn’t be more familiar with that green flame. He remembered that Dong Men Universe God, who could have resisted the second Sacred Thunder, was burnt to die because of that little stream of green fire.

What’s worse, the fire that Jian Wushuang met this time was far larger than that of Dong Men Universe God’s test.

“Is the most dangerous part of the Inverse Cultivation Test coming?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the heavens. Even though the seven Sacred Thunder seemed creepy, Jian Wushuang didn’t feel afraid at all.

He was ready to embrace the challenge no matter how difficult it was.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang got several elixirs in his hands by using his magic power.

He had collected those elixirs exclusively for the Inverse Cultivation. Each of them was very precious.

With the help of elixirs, Jian Wushuang’s weak body recovered soon. Then he took out another two treasures.

They were the Blaze Quicksand Gourd and the Dark Green Bell.

He once lent Blaze Quicksand Gourd to Master of the Dayu Palace and didn’t take it back even when he would battle with Qing Yang Universe God. And the Master of the Dayu Palace hadn’t returned to him until 20 years ago. Now this treasure might help Jian Wushuang in his Inverse Cultivation.

As he opened the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, a large amount of Blaze Quicksand gushed out.

The Blaze Quicksand flew at a crazy speed to the seventh Sacred Thunder, which helped to weaken its power and lower its speed.

And the small Dark Green Bell on his other hand, transformed itself into an enormous ancient bell.

“Immovable Mountain!”

Jian Wushuang murmured a spell, catalyzing the secret skill of the Dark Green Bell.

Immediately, this green bell produced a green halo, which surround the whole body of Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

The seventh Sacred Thunder came with irresistible force. It went through the Blaze Quicksand and instantly struck the bell, producing a low and deep sound.

The bell violently shook, with a crack appearing on the surface.

And the crack became larger and larger at an alarming rate and finally it burst.

However, the seventh Sacred Thunder, as well as the green fire within it, was still powerful and continued to attack Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt shocked, and he tried his best to mobilize all his remaining power.

“Go, Blood Mountain Sword!”

Jian Wushuang generated all his power into the Blood Mountain Sword and ordered it to collide with the seventh Sacred Thunder.

This time, the collision slashed the power of the seventh Sacred Thunder by more than half. Only a tiny fraction of power, along with a small part of the green fire, rushed to Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was instantly equipped with the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

Bang!

Despite being weakened by the Blood-killing Plate Armor, the burning green fire was still furious enough and caused great pain to Jian Wushuang.

Oh!

Jian Wushuang spit a large amount of blood and went pale immediately as the green fire also went out.

Finally, Jian Wushuang successfully resisted the seventh Sacred Thunder.

But only after a moment, Jian Wushuang found that deep in the heaven, the eighth Sacred Thunder was simmering.

“The eighth?”

There was nothing but dead silence among the talents who were watching.

Jian Wushuang didn’t expect that either.

“Now nothing is left except the Tribunal Passing Elixir!” Soon, another elixir turned up in his hand.

The invaluable Tribunal Passing Elixir!

It was prepared especially for the God Test, in which Jian Wushuang could recover his power to one hundred percent within an instant!

An extraordinary elixir!

But only one elixir could be taken in one test.

That was why Jian Wushuang didn’t swallow this elixir when he exhausted almost all of his power under the attack of the fourth, the fifth and the sixth Sacred Thunder. But this time, he had no choice.

He swallowed it without any hesitation.

As soon as he swallowed the elixir, he recovered his power at an astonishing speed, faster than that with the help of King of Venomous Worms.

“One extraordinary function of the Tribunal Passing Elixir is transforming the power of the surrounding Sacred Thunders into my power. No wonder I was told that it could only play a role in the God Test! Wonderful!”

Jian Wushuang’s power reached its best now.

However, his Ancient God Power and Soul Power was still exhausted because the elixir could only be used to help recover Spiritual Power.

Right at the moment when Jian Wushuang fully recovered his Spiritual Power, a booming sound shook the universe.

The eighth Sacred Thunder arrived, completely composed of green fire!

“The Fire Test!”

“The entire Fire Test!!”
