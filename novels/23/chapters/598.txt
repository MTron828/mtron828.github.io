“Oh?”

Holy Ancestor and the other experts all smiled upon hearing Lin Lan’s words.

They were surprised to know that she just wanted to present a gift.

“Your Honors, look!”

Lin Lan managed to stay calm. She waved her hand and a coffin made of amethyst immediately appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Yes, the gift was a coffin!

After seeing the coffin, Holy Ancestor’s smile froze on his face.

The whole place became dead silent.

Lin Lan continued, “I personally selected this gift for you, your Excellency. It is made of refined amethysts and can prevent your body from decaying for a thousand years. I’m sure you will be comfortable in it after your death.”

Holy Ancestor looked grim as he listened to these words.

The other experts all looked at Lin Lan in astonishment.

The coffin might be a treasure in a manner of speaking, but it should never be given as a birthday gift.

“Bastard!”

Fury got the better of Holy Ancestor and, with a pat, he smashed the table in front of him to dust.

Right at this moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly took off his bamboo hat and stood up from his seat, with a long sword on his back. He walked slowly to the center of the field, while speaking, “Holy Ancestor, it seems that you are unsatisfied with my disciple’s gift.”

“Don’t be greedy. The others won’t be so lucky as to receive such a nice gift,” He continued.

As the sound of his voice came to an end, he had moved into the center of the field. A moment later, he raised up his head and released an overwhelming a killing intent that dominated the whole area like a dragon flying in the sky.

The place fell into dead silence again.

The atmosphere became frigid.

The fine wine, food, and objects on the tables were crushed into pieces under this killing intent and waterdrops kept flying in all directions.

The feast looked more like a funeral at that moment because of the depressing atmosphere.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Holy Ancestor, Stone Ancestor, Dong Ming King, and Qian Xingzi all gazed at him from their seats.

Their eyes narrowed when Jian Wushuang revealed his face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Jian Wushuang!” Holy Ancestor roared in an icy voice.

Stone Ancestor and the others beside him, however, looked excited.

“It’s him!”

“He knows where Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion is!”

“Finally, he showed up!”

“Haha, boy, tell me the location of Sword Ancestor’s mansion and I’ll spare your life.”

Those Skyscraping Realm experts all looked at Jian Wushuang with eager eyes, except Spirit Ancestor. His eyes betrayed his complicated feelings.

Jian Wushuang smiled at them coldly.

“Those men are still coveting Sword Ancestor’s mansion and Ancient World Token even while at death’s door.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head. He had the Heart-killing Sword in hand and, behind him, the Golden Sword Soul Phantom rose up high to its limit.

The Phantom radiated a domineering and Supreme Sword Essence that made the onlookers’ hearts skip a beat.

“Hmm?”

The Ancestors’ eyes became sharp. They could tell that Jian Wushuang was a lot more powerful than before.

“Holy Ancestor, Stone Ancestor, Dong Ming King, Qian Xingzi...” Jian Wushuang called their names out, one by one.

“Do you still remember what I said last time on the outskirts of Sword-suppression Valley?”

After being asked, the Ancestors could not help recalling what had happened in the valley.

In fact, they never forgot this boy’s words, the words that the poor boy had been forced to say by a dozen Skyscraping Realm experts.

“I’ll never forget what you’ve done today!

As well as how I was suppressed.

“Someday, when I come back, no matter if you’re in heaven or hell, I’ll kill you all!

“Wait for me!”

Those words had indeed felt threatening at the time, but as time passed they stopped taking it seriously.

Now, Jian Wushuang really had come back for them!

“Hump! He can’t change anything now that he’s come back. He must have progressed a little during the last year.”?The Ancestors still looked down on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked at them emotionlessly as his killing intent reached its peak.

“I always achieve what I’ve said.

So, today, since we are having a feast, I’ll make your heads a cup and treat your blood as?the wine.

All of you... must die!”

Jian Wushuang spoke firmly as if he was pronouncing their deaths.

His voice echoed in the place for a long time.

“How arrogant!”

With the shout, a short man dived forward from his table.

The man was called Qian Xingzi, one of the five experts from the other plane worlds.

“Boy, let’s see if your power matches your arrogance!”

Qian Xingzi was surrounded by killing intent as he took out a purple longsword from somewhere. Then, he neared Jian Wushuang and thrust the longsword forward as well.

The entire space was filled with a purple light. Qian Xingzi launched a single blow, but there seemed to be thousands of sword shadows rushing towards Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Holy Ancestor hurriedly shouted, “Qian Xingzi, be careful. Don’t kill him.”

“I know.” Qian Xingzi looked grim. Though he was targeting Jian Wushuang’s chest, he had restrained his power for fear of killing Jian Wushuang on spot.

“Huh, why hasn’t this boy make a move yet? Is he paralyzed?”?Qian Xingzi was amazed to see Jian Wushuang standing still while he was about to have a longsword pierce into his body.

However, at the very next moment, Jian Wushuang moved.

He simply swung his sword at Qian Xingzi without any skill.
