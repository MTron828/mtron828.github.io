Chapter 3005: Find a Way to Escape

——

A cold yet gorgeous Sword Shadow suddenly swept out.

Swordsmanship…Star Dream!

Previously, Jian Wushuang had not guided the Sword Shadow in the Blood Mountain Sword. He had only used it by himself, but in the end, he still killed Holy Master Huocang, a rank two True Saint.

Now that Jian Wushuang had fully guided the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, his battle strength had increased by several times. Naturally, this sword move was even more terrifying.

It was incredibly fast!

The most terrifying part of Star Dream was its tearing power and its speed.

Under the heaven-designated skill, both Stone Saint and Tian Mound King were unable to move. They could only let the cold and gorgeous Sword Shadow attack them.

The Sword Shadow first slashed at Stone Saint’s divine body.

Stone Saint’s body-protecting ability was strong. The surface of his body was formed by the power of the earth principles, which formed a thick mountain. This mountain might be able to withstand the attacks of many rank two True Saints but facing Jian Wushuang’s sword…

Whoosh! A large amount of the power of the earth principles spread out at a terrifying speed. The defensive means formed by the power of the earth principles completely collapsed. Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword continued to tear the armor on Stone Saint’s body, then it passed through Stone Saint’s divine body.

Then, the sword light continued to slash toward Tian Mound King.

Tian Mound King’s protective ability was far inferior to Stone Saint’s. Under the Sword Shadow, his divine body was instantly defeated.

In just one exchange, the two rank two True Saint experts who had intended to stop Jian Wushuang died on the spot.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had also consumed a total of 11 drops of the god-burning poison.

“With my current strength, it would be easy for me to kill an ordinary rank two True Saint with the help of the Star Dream first move, the heaven-designated skill, and the god-burning poison.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and waved his hand to kill the two subordinates of the rank two True Saint. Then, he continued to run forward.

The news of the deaths of Tian Mound King and Stone Saint reached the ears of the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

“What? Tian Mound King and Stone Saint joined hands, but they couldn’t stop him and were killed by him?”

“Tian Mound King and Stone Saint died in one move? How could he be so powerful?”

“He’s too powerful!”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were following Jian Wushuang or coming from all directions were shocked.

They were shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength.

In the distance, Lord Wu, who was rushing over, was also shocked when he heard the news.

“How is this possible?”

“Even a peak rank two True Saint couldn’t do anything to Tian Mound King and Stone Saint in a short period of time, but this man killed them both in one move. Could it be that his strength has reached the level of a rank three True Saint?”

Lord Wu could not help but think.

In his opinion, only True Saints above the third rank had the ability to do this. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hmph, even if it’s a third rank True Saint, he would definitely die if he massacred the experts under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom in our territory!” Lord Wu’s voice was ice cold, “Pass down the order. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s person is extremely powerful and might reach the third rank True Saint level. Tell our people to be extremely careful and try not to get close to him, but we have to think of a way to find out his exact location.”

“In addition, inform Gold King to personally come over.”

“Gold King?” The few True Saints behind Lord Wu could not help but be shocked.

Gold King? This was definitely an extremely terrifying existence in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

Long ago, the Magic Note Divine King had used a great method to establish the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Along the way, he had led many experts under his command into a frenzied battle. More than half of these experts had already died, but there were still a few who survived.

These experts who survived had already stayed in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, occupying many territories and becoming dukes.

And amongst them, two supreme existences had directly become kings in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom!

These two kings were the Gold King and Wind King. They were extremely powerful and had long since stepped into the third level True Saint Realm. They were the two strongest people in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom apart from the Magic Note King.

Normally, these two supreme existences did not care about the affairs of the world. Unless the king personally summoned them, they would not care about anyone. Even Lord Wu could only invite the two kings but could not give orders… Furthermore, whether the other party would agree or not was a completely different matter.

“Go. This matter concerns the king’s face. The king is extremely furious. The Gold King should have agreed to appear,” Lord Wu said.

“Yes.” The True Saint nodded and immediately sent the message.

After a while, the result came out.

“Lord, His Highness King Jin has agreed to help. He is now rushing to the nearest space passage,” the True Saint said.

“Great.” Lord Wu’s eyes immediately lit up. “There is no doubt about King Jin’s strength. If he acts personally, he can easily kill that man. Before King Jin arrives, let’s not act rashly. We just need to know his location.”

Lord Wu quickly gave the order to the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who had joined in the killing of Jian Wushuang.

…

In the vast void, Jian Wushuang was still rushing forward at high speed.

“It seems that killing two rank two True Saints had intimidated these people. Now they are all far away from me and don’t dare to approach me.” Jian Wushuang smiled and swept his soul power in all directions.

He was so fast that almost none of the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom could keep up with him. Although they could not keep up with him, they still had a way to know his location.

For example, they had already given orders to all the cultivators in the territory to take action. Countless experts stood in every corner to observe and check. As soon as Jian Wushuang passed by, they would immediately notify him, of course, they could find out where Jian Wushuang was.

But even if they knew his location, no one dared to come forward and stop him in a short period of time.

Even two rank two True Saints were easily killed by Jian wushuang. If they wanted to stop Jian Wushuang, they had to be the rank three True Saints themselves. However, even in the vast Magic Note Divine Kingdom, there were very few rank three True Saints, in the current territory, the only rank three True Saint who had been mobilized in a short time was the Golden Mountain Sect Master who had been following Jian Wushuang.

“I can’t go on like this. My position has always been under the surveillance of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Although no one dares to stop me now, it won’t be long before the real experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom arrive to kill me!”

“It seems that I have to think of a way to escape.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.
