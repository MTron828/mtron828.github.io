Chapter 3210: Attack

——

“Thunder God, the three of us don’t have any personal grudges against you. Our Ziwei Divine Sect has always been in awe of the Destruction Saint Realm. Why do you have to be so aggressive?” The long-haired old man who was fighting with Thunder God shouted in a low voice.

“You and I don’t have any personal grudges, but your Ziwei Divine Sect has always been in awe of my Destruction Saint Realm, but that doesn’t seem to be the case, does it?”

“Don’t forget, a hundred thousand years ago, the last time the Blood Wave Realm opened, there was an Invincible Saint of our Destruction Saint Realm. It was because of the defeat of your Ziwei Divine Sect that he died,” Thunder God said coldly.

“The last time the Blood Wave Realm opened?” The long-haired elder was startled, then, he said angrily, “That was because both sides fought over the Blood Wave Token. There was no fair background to speak of. Even if you died in the battle, you can only blame yourself for not being strong enough. You can’t blame anyone else, but you, the Destruction Saint Realm, actually used this matter to make a fuss?”

“Humph, I, who destroy the Saint Realm, can’t die in vain,” Thunder God said coldly, “stop struggling and accept your death!”

The battle immediately became even more intense.

In the void not far from the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and the other three heard the conversation between Thunder God and the long-haired elder.

“Tsk, tsk, this Destruction Saint Realm is really overbearing. The fight for opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm is extremely crazy. Countless experts from various forces will participate in the fight, and it is reasonable to accidentally kill them in the fight. Under normal circumstances, if an expert from their side is killed in the fight for opportunities, the force behind the expert will not take revenge. They can only blame themselves for not being good enough.”

“Although the forces of the Divine Beginning Realm have never agreed on this point, they have long formed a tacit understanding. Only in this way can the experts of the forces of the absolute beginning divine realm fight for that opportunity without any scruples. But this Destruction Saint Realm…is still holding a grudge.” Qian Hongzi sneered.

“The three Saint Realms have always been overbearing. This point has long been known to the world. However, perhaps they still have some misgivings about the forces of the Divine Beginning Realm. This destruction holy region didn’t directly take revenge on the Ziwei Divine Sect on the surface. They only attacked when the Blood Wave Realm opened this time.” Duan Lang said.

“In any case, the three people from the Ziwei Divine Sect are unlucky to be targeted by Thunder God and the others,” Yue Yu said, but suddenly, his expression changed. “Guys, it’s rare to meet people from the Destruction Saint Realm. Should we directly attack them and teach them a lesson?”

“Directly attack them? Teach them a lesson?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

However, Qian Hongzi, Feixue, and Duan Lang were quite enthusiastic.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, I’m afraid you don’t know that in the Divine Beginning Realm, the three great Saint Realms are high and mighty. Only the three great Freedom Alliances are qualified to challenge the three great Saint Realms directly. Because of this, the three great Freedom Alliances and the three great Saint Realms have been fighting for a long time. Whether it is on the surface or in the dark, there are many battles. Both sides have long been like fire and water. In this Blood Wave Realm, the competition between the three great Saint Realms and the three great Freedom Alliances is also very fierce,” Qian Hongzi said with a smile.

“Yes, Temple Master Bai Xing has already told us that if we meet people from the three Saint Realms, we don’t have to be polite with them,” Yue Yu said with a smile.

“In that case, what are we waiting for?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining. He was worried that he could not find a reason to attack the three Saint Realms.

“Di Hao, what about you?” Qian Hongzi glanced at Di Hao.

“Thunder God, leave it to me,” Di Hao said coldly.

“Haha, if that’s the case, then let’s do it.” Qian Hongzi laughed, and instantly, six figures charged towards the battlefield.

On the battlefield, the three from the Ziwei Divine Sect were in a precarious situation.

But at this moment…sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!

Six figures charged toward them at an astonishing speed.

“Eh?”

The faces of the five from the Destruction Saint Realm all changed.

“That person is…Di Hao?” Thunder God’s eyes darkened. “Not good, it’s the Temporal Temple!”

“Careful!”

Thunder God immediately let out a low shout. The six from the Temporal Temple were all experts in the principles of space and time, and they were astonishingly fast. In an instant, they had charged into the battlefield.

The leader, Di Hao, was emitting an endless destructive aura. As he approached, the huge axe on his back appeared out of thin air in his hand.

Boom! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The huge ax suddenly slashed out.

Just the power of this earth-shattering ax was enough to make ordinary Peak Saints despair.

However, Di Hao was facing Thunder God, who was ranked sixth on the True Saint rankings. In terms of ranking, he was even higher than Di Hao.

“Get lost!”

Di Hao let out a roar. The two long spears in his hands were filled with endless dark purple lightning. The moment he stabbed out, a huge dark purple thunder dragon instantly roared.

Bang!

With a loud sound, the thunder dragon collapsed and the ax shadow dissipated.

Di Hao and Thunder God both retreated rapidly. However, the next moment, they rushed out again and fought fiercely.

While Di Hao and Thunder God were fighting, Qian Hongzi, Yue Yu, Duan Lang, Feixue, and Jian Wushuang also found their opponents.

Jian Wushuang’s opponent was a beautiful woman in a plain robe. The beautiful woman wore a pair of crystal gloves, which were suffused with rich principles power. When she saw Jian Wushuang rushing toward her, she was stunned, the beautiful woman was stunned.

“A mere rank six True Saint dares to enter the Blood Wave Realm? You’re courting death!”

The beautiful woman raised her right hand. Under the gathering of endless divine power, her right hand instantly enlarged and then directly struck toward Jian Wushuang.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. When he approached the beautiful woman, the divine power aura on his body also began to rise at an alarming speed.

Seven-star secret skill, divine punishment, and nine brilliant star armor!

In just a short moment, Jian Wushuang had displayed all three secret skills at the same time, and his battle strength had reached its peak.

“Wushuang Sword manual, Xi Xiang!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he slashed down with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Along with a mournful beast roar, an astonishing ruthless aura spread out. A blood-red sword light, like a blood-red thunderbolt, struck the beautiful woman’s crystal-clear palm in an instant, then a terrifying power suddenly erupted.

“What?”

The beautiful woman clearly did not expect that the power contained in Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship would be so strong. In an instant, she felt her palm go numb and a majestic impact came, it caused her to take several steps back before she came to a stop.

“How is this possible? He’s only a rank six True Saint. How can he be so powerful? He’s actually stronger than me?” The beautiful woman’s face was filled with disbelief..
