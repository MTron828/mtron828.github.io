Chapter 3516: Inside the Star Palace

Marquis Duan Yu stood under the special pattern and waved his hand, throwing a token toward the special pattern.

When the token was about to touch the pattern, the pattern seemed to come alive, swallowing the token in one gulp. After a while, it was spat out again.

At the same time, a layer of gray light slowly emerged from the special pattern, and an ancient aura spread out from it.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. The stone wall vibrated, and the pattern began to evolve. In just a moment, a dark and boundless passage appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“This is the universe passage?” Jian Wushuang looked at the passage in front of him in surprise. He felt that the universe passage was much more stable than the spatial passages he had seen in the Divine Beginning Realm, in the depths of the universe passage, there was an aura that frightened Jian Wushuang.

“The principle of the universe passage is actually the same as the space passages in the Divine Beginning Realm. It’s just that the vast universe space is much more stable than the Divine Beginning Realm. The pressure of the universe origin is also very strong. To set up a universe passage in the vast universe is countless times more difficult than setting up a space passage in the Divine Beginning Realm. For example, my Star Palace once spent a lot of money to set up this universe passage.”

“The most important thing is that the distance between the Star Palace and the Earth star is not too far. It takes a Principles Master dozens of years to reach the Star Palace, so the universe passage can be set up. However, if the distance is too far, for example, the universe passage from one world star to another, it will be very difficult to set up. Even if the entire Star Palace works hard, it will be very difficult to set up such a universe passage,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“The universe passage has been opened. My dear Heavenly Sword Marquis, please follow me.” After saying that, Marquis Duan Yu directly entered the universe passage.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and immediately followed him.

Through the universe passage, Jian Wushuang and Marquis Duan Yu came to the vicinity of Star Palace.

“My dear Heavenly Sword Marquis, look, that’s Star Palace.” Marquis Duan Yu pointed to a floating land in front of them.

This floating land was a small earth star.

However, this earth star had been occupied by the Star Palace a long time ago, and it had been modified by the Star Palace. It indeed looked different from an ordinary earth star.

“In the vast universe, many forces will occupy some earth stars as their nest, and our Star Palace is no exception.” Marquis Duan Yu smiled and then led Jian Wushuang directly to the earth star where the Star Palace was located.

This earth star was very small, and its area was not as large as a small territory in the Divine Beginning Realm. However, it was more than enough to be the lairs of a force.

In the dark void around the earth star, Jian Wushuang could vaguely see some faint golden thunderbolts flashing from time to time. Any of these faint golden thunderbolts gave Jian Wushuang a feeling of destruction. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“There is a special formation around the Earth Star. It seems that the level of this formation is extraordinary. It should have reached the level of the Earth Saint Realm, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You are right. After all, the earth star is the nest of the Star Palace. The sect-protecting formation can not be careless. It is indeed an Earth Saint Realm formation, and it is not weak among the Earth Saint Realm formations. Usually, the formation maintains normal operation. Even if three or five masters come at once, the formation can easily resist them!”

“In a life-or-death battle, Star Palace will activate the formation regardless of the consequences. At that time, the formation will not only be able to resist the attacks of several masters, but it will also be able to kill the masters!” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“Kill the masters? So powerful?” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

“My young friend, what I just said is actually a secret in Star Palace. Only the experts at the highest level of Star Palace are qualified to know about it. However, your relationship with Star Palace is quite delicate, so it’s okay to know about it. However, you must not tell others about it. After all, it’s a killer move of Star Palace. If the enemy forces know about it, it will have a big impact,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Let’s go in first.”

With Marquis Duan Yu’s guidance, Jian Wushuang entered the Star Palace without any obstacles.

There were also many buildings in the Star Palace, which were very strange in shape and were very different from the Divine Beginning Realm.

As they flew through the Star Palace, Jian Wushuang could also sense the obscure aura coming from the surrounding buildings.

Along the way, they also met other cultivators. Some of them even came up to greet them.

“Marquis Duan Yu, you’re finally back. I’ve been waiting for you here for a long time.” A burly middle-aged man with a height of more than two meters came up to Marquis Duan Yu.

“Oh, Heavy Master?” Marquis Duan Yu’s expression changed, and then he said with a smile, “You’re here for your brother, right?”

“Yes, my brother has been trapped there for some time, and his situation is getting more and more dangerous. If I don’t find a way to break the formation and save him, my life will be in danger at any time,” Heavy Master said anxiously.

“I know, don’t worry. I’ll go with you after I’ve settled the young friend behind me,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“The young man behind you...” the Heavy Master immediately looked at Jian Wushuang. However, when he saw Jian Wushuang, his expression immediately became strange. “Is he...a saint?”

“A saint actually came to the Universe Battlefield?”

“Heavy Master, although the young man behind me is only a saint, his status is extraordinary. In terms of strength, I’m afraid you’re not his match,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“I’m not his match? Marquis Duan Yu, are you kidding?” Heavy Master laughed.

This was normal. Heavy Master was a Principles Master at the peak of the void fourth realm and had cultivated a special secret skill. Even if he met an expert of the void fifth realm, he could still fight. But Jian Wushuang…was obviously just an Immortal Saint.

The Heavy Master had never been to the Divine Beginning Realm and had never heard of Heavenly Sword Marquis’ name. Naturally, he subconsciously felt that a saint was not that strong.

“You’ll know whether it’s a joke or not in the future. But now, if you want me to hurry up and save your brother, you’d better step aside,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“Of course, of course.” The Heavy Master laughed dryly and immediately stepped aside.

Jian Wushuang looked at the Heavy Master with interest and then continued to follow Marquis Duan Yu.
