Chapter 782: A Gathering

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Xuan Yi’s words embarrassed Tian Yunzi. Despite his indignation, he forced himself to calm down and not lose his temper.

“Good, very good.”

Tian Yunzi stared at Xuan Yi and said, “Xuan Yi, I know what you’re capable of. With your protection, I surely cannot do anything to your precious disciple. Since that’s the case, I’ll bring the other two. I’ll see how you can still protect your disciple under your wing.”

“The other two?” Xuan Yi’s expression changed.

Those experts of all the sects burst into an uproar.

It was because they knew exactly who the other two were.

Then, Tian Yunzi took out a Messaging Slip and sent a message. Soon, he received a response.

“Xuan Yi, let me see who else can protect your disciple today.” Tian Yunzi said with a chilling voice.

“Oh?” Xuan Yi raised his eyebrow but did not reply.

Shortly after Tian Yunzi sent the message, two figures landed in this place one after another.

One of them was a sturdy middle-aged man, who was wearing battling armor and boots. His eyes were shooting bolts of black lightning.

“Pay my tribute to Divine Emperor.”?

Seeing the man, the remaining experts of the Immortal Dynasty who were not killed by Jian Wushuang all straightened up and gave a salute, their eyes revealing a fever of enthusiasm.

This middle-aged man was the supreme Divine Emperor of the Immortal Dynasty. No one knew what his real name was. They only knew he was surnamed Tu. Thus, all the experts in the Firmament Territory always addressed him as Emperor Tu.

Soon after Emperor Tu’s arrival, a beautiful and slender girl entered the area. This girl seemed to be only 15 or 16 years old and she looked very delicate. When she appeared in this area, everything in her vicinity was outshined by her.

When those experts first saw this gorgeous girl, they were intoxicated with her beauty. At this point, even if the girl ordered them to die, some of them would certainly follow her order without hesitation.

“Pay my tribute to Demon Master!”

Experts of the Boundless Demon Sect all saluted this pretty girl.

This pretty girl was the Sect Master of the Boundless Demon Sect, who was also called Demon Master. Her name was Su Bin, so people usually called her Demon Master Su.

Emperor Tu, Demon Master Su, and the Cloud Sea Asgard’s Tian Yunzi were all Sect Masters of the three most powerful magnates in the Firmament Territory.

The three had reached the level of Dao Master a long time ago and became supreme experts.

Today, the three Dao Masters had gathered!

As Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su landed in the Void, the whole area fell silent.

Before they arrived, some experts from top sects were still chatting from time to time. But now, they had all shut up and did not dare to say anything more in case they accidentally upset one of the three big shots.

Each of these three was quite legendary in the Firmament Territory.

“Well, this is a scene of bustle, isn’t it?”

When Emperor Tu arrived, his eyes swept across the scene. The ordinary experts never caught his eyes. Only when he looked at Xuan Yi did his eyes freeze for a moment.

“Tian Yunzi, I’m just in the middle of a closed-door training. I got here the moment I received your message. Tell me, what’s going on?” Demon Master Su asked.

“As for the whole thing, you can ask your subordinates. They will tell you why I invited you here,” Tian Yunzi said. Facing Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su who were level with himself, Tian Yunzi did not dare to put himself so highly.

Bewildered, Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su immediately consulted their own experts.

Saber Master of the Immortal Dynasty and Old Weirdo Dream of the Boundless Demon Sect hurried forward to recount what had happened.

After learning the development of the recent events, Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su both looked fascinated.

They also fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Bravo. This guy managed to spend 100 years in the Eternal Zone without being killed. And he even boosted his strength considerably?” Emperor Tu looked zealous.? ?

“A Divine Realm expert can turn into a Gold-armored Demon God? And his battle strength is stronger than Yun Fan and the other two experts at Step Four of the Eternal Realm? Even Tian Yunzi’s doppelganger was nearly killed by him! This is unbelievable! We’ve never had such a Divine Realm expert whose powerful is in defiance of the natural order in the Firmament Territory, have we?” Demon Master Su was also amazed.

After the initial shock, they both arrived at a conclusion.

Jian Wushuang must have carried a huge secret, a secret that involves the most important Demon God Clan of the Eternal Zone.

It was exactly this secret that endowed Jian Wushuang with a kind of power in defiance of the natural order!

This secret was something that intrigued the two and even made them crave for it.

“Xuan Yi, this Jian Wushuang is a disciple of yours?” Emperor Tu looked at Xuan Yi and asked.

“Yes.” Xuan Yi nodded slightly.

Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su stared at each other, both of their faces darkened.

They knew very well that Xuan Yi was not someone they could provoke.

But the secret that Jian Wushuang was hiding was not a trivial matter at all.

If the two were tied together…Almost at the same time, a trace of decisiveness flitted across their eyes.

“Xuan Yi, your disciple is carrying a big secret about the whole Eternal Zone. How can you allow him to keep such a secret to himself? You might as well just let him tell us the secret.” Emperor Tu said.

“Yes, as long as he honestly tells us the whole story about what he had been through in the Eternal Zone over the past 100 years, we will not give him a hard time anymore.” Demon Master Su added.

“Haha, Xuan Yi, you heard that. A moment ago, when I was all by myself, I truly could not force you into anything. But now, with the presence of Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su, if you still refuse to hand your disciple over, are you really going to make a hopeless attempt to take on the three of us?”

“Teacher.” Jian Wushuang could not help but cast a tense look at Xuan Yi.

But deep down, Jian Wushuang felt like giving a wry smile.

Now, everyone on the scene, including Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su, all thought he had obtained some precious opportunity in the Eternal Zone that helped him to gain such an amazing battle strength. They also believed that Jian Wushuang knew many secrets about the Demon God Clan.

But in reality, it was true that Jian Wushuang met a lot of opportunities in the Eternal Zone—he learned how to transform into an Ancient God, mastered myriads of Secret Skills, brought his strength to a higher level—but the true reason for his incredulous strength as a Divine Realm expert was still the Heavenly Creation Skill that he had been practicing.

Those opportunities were just something extra.

Although he did know some secrets of the Ancient God, they were not a lot.

Just when everyone was gazing at Xuan Yi, Xuan Yi’s eyes shifted. Then, he gave a smile and said, “I am actually not very sure of what this guy came across in the Eternal Zone. Please let me question him first, and I’ll address you all later. What do you think?”
