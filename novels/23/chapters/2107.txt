Chapter 2108 Confirmation

Within the Sky Swallowing Sanctuary, in a secluded territory.“Jian Wushuang has already left the underground palace and ordered the experts to go to the human territory.” The elderly man said coldly.“What about the palace?” Ba Su asked.

“According to the intel that Acheron Palace received, Jian Wushuang has arranged for several experts to guard the palace and given the order that none shall attempt to enter.” The elder man said.

“Humph. As expected, it is impossible for him to refine that sacred weapon. He is not dumb so he gave up after trying for eighteen years. If he can’t refine that weapon, he won’t be able to bring it out of the palace. All he can do is leave the weapon there and protect it.” Ba Su smiled.

“That seemed to be the case.” The elder man nodded his head.

They did not suspect anything at all.

After all, the weapon was the Soul Swallowing Pearl. Who could refine it within eighteen years?

What they did not know was that they had fallen right into the trap Jian Wushuang set.

“This is probably the best news we can have after the disastrous incident: the sacred weapon is not refined by Jian Wushuang. However, the alliance between the Sanctuary Alliance and the Special Tribes Alliance is not good news for the Three-Emperor World.” The elder man said grimly.

Their main goal was to control the Special Tribes Alliance secretly through the Sky Swallowing Clan.

If this did not work, they would secretly attack the few top tier clans and wipe them out. The Special Tribes Alliance would be shaken to the core. Everyone then would be secure and uniting would be difficult.

Its a pity that this double layered plan had failed.

The conditions in the Special Tribes Territory were very stable and not much could be done.

...

Human territory, Thunderbolt Island.

The first thing Jian Wushuang did when he returned to Thunderbolt Island was look for Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen.

“Emperor Bai, the experts among the Special Tribes Alliance have now reached the human territory.” Jian Wushuang said.

“I know. I have made arrangements for their accommodation. Jian Wushuang, you did well.” Emperor Bai looked approvingly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had not only resolved the crisis within the Special Tribes, but he had also become the leader of Special Tribes Alliance.

Jian Wushuang, who was both a human and the Ancient God Emperor, could ensure the peaceful cooperation between the Sanctuary Alliance and the Special Tribes Alliance.

“During the time I was gone, how was Sanctuary Alliance? Have all the spies from Vientiane Tower been caught?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We have found most of them. The remaining few will not pose any threat to us.” Ancestor Tian Chen smiled.

“There should be spies from the Acheron Palace within the Special Tribes Alliance. It will be far too difficult to catch them all.” Jian Wushuang continued.

“It does not matter. These small fries will have a minimal effect in this war.” Emperor Bai smiled.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head, “That’s true.”

It would be truly dangerous for the Eternal Chaotic World if the situation were like this: Emperor Zi Xu and Vientiane Tower were not found and destroyed, and the spies from the Acheron Palace went to infiltrate the Special Tribes under the cover of the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Now that the majority of the spies had been caught, the remaining pawns would be far too weak to affect the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Emperor Bai, Ancestor Tian Chen. I have an update. I have managed to refine the Soul Swallowing Pearl.”

“What?” Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen were in awe.

Emperor Bai looked over and exclaimed, “Eighteen years! You only took eighteen years to refine the Soul Swallowing Swallowing Pearl? Are you kidding me?”

Even Emperor Bai was astonished by that feat.

He clearly knew how difficult it was to refine the Soul Swallowing Pearl. It would be amazing even if someone could manage to refine the pearl within a hundred and eighteen thousand years, much less eighteen years.

The first leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan was a genius, but it had taken him eight hundred thousand years to refine the same pearl. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I really did successfully refine it. Look.” Jian Wushuang said as a pearl that radiated tremendous soul power appeared from within Jian Wushuang.

“This Aura... I fought with the leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan once. This is indeed the Soul Swallowing Pearl. How did you refine it within such a short amount of time?” Emperor Bai asked as he stared at the pearl.

“I have no idea. I felt that the process of refining the pearl was easy. There are nine spells within the Soul Swallowing Pearl. One must master all of them before they can use the pearl. I managed to learn these nine spells easily. Emperor Bai, you too are an inverse cultivator. Does it feel easy to try and perceive and learn new things?” Jian Wushuang continued.

“Very easily? Jian Wushuang, you must be kidding me.”

Emperor Bai narrowed his eyes and looked at him weirdly, “Even though I have a good perception,it still takes time for me to grasp certain things such as Rules or Order. In the first era, I was totally clueless about Rules or Order, hence i was not one of the strongest back then. I only managed to grasp a little of Rules of Order during the second era over a very long time, with the help of many opportunities.”

“If it was easy for me to perceive concepts, why would I take so long to grasp a little of Rules or Order?”

Ancestor Tian Chen too looked over at Jian Wushuang curiously.

Jian Wushuang smiled sheepishly and fell quiet.

He got confirmation that the reason he could learn any secret skills or grasp concepts far faster than most people could imagine had nothing to do with him being an inverse cultivator.

That left Jian Wushuang with the other possibility.

Universal Dao Scripture...

“Even though I have no idea why I have such a good perception, the Soul Swallowing Pearl is indeed refined, which has helped boost my soul power tremendously to the level of a top-tier stage one great emperor. If I make use of it to cast a soul attack, I can even threaten a stage two great emperor. All that I am missing is a powerful soul attack secret skill!!” Jian Wushuang said.
