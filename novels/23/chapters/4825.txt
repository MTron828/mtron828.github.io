4827 The Netherworld Dharma Formation

The might of the old Daoist’s sword strike had actually injured him!

One must know that Di Qing was already a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, ranked at the peak. Even great Yan Immortals of the same realm could hardly injure him.

However, the old Daoist who claimed to have walked out of the Netherworld had injured him with just a casual sword strike.

Di Qing was not the only one. After Jian Wushuang destroyed the sword strike, the undisguisable Sword Intent also made his qi and blood boil.

This casual strike had injured them to varying degrees. Netherworld Old Daoist did not stop at all. He stabbed forward with his treasured True Sword again!

“Chengqi!” Di Qing chanted the incantation in a deep voice, and a huge beam of light that could not be covered surged from his back.

A pure-white crow appeared, and its eyes, which were as holy as a snow lotus, had a divine charm. Then, it crashed into the Netherworld Old Daoist.

As if sensing the threat, he took a step back and swung the horsetail whisk in his left hand forward.

In an instant, hundreds of millions of white threads of the horsetail whisk danced like long snakes and came down on the white crow.

The two collided, and before the celestial form of the White Crow could even release its power, it was already entangled by the countless white threads of the horsetail whisk.

Jian Wushuang frowned and immediately looked at Zhao Ting and Xi Qingchi, who were both pale. “When we fight later, I’ll use all my strength to tear a hole in the magic formation. Then, you can go as far away as you can.

Zhao Ting looked at him and opened her mouth, but she did not say anything.

Xi Qingchi’s eyes were slightly red as it said, “My Lord, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

“Good luck,” Jian Wushuang took one last look at her and walked forward with the Invisible Sword in his hand.

Di Qing’s expression was solemn as he said in a deep voice, “Although this old Daoist has already died, the energy contained in his body is extremely abundant. I’m afraid his Immortal Source has not been consumed.”

Jian Wushuang looked forward with a serious expression. If his judgment was correct, old Daoist Huang Quan was likely to be a peak Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, the same realm as Di Qing.

Moreover, old Daoist Huang Quan was not fighting alone. More and more Immortal bones were tearing apart the Immortal graveyard and walking out of it, waiting for his orders.

The first battle after entering the Great Mi Heaven would probably be quite tricky.

After Di Qing’s attack was offset by the white silk of the horsetail whisk, Netherworld Old Daoist stopped fighting. Instead, he retreated quickly and waved the horsetail whisk in his hand.

The horsetail whisk seemed to have some kind of bewitching demonic sound, and the Immortal bones once again flew over from all directions.

“Don’t let these things get close to me. I’ll go and take that old Daoist’s head,” Di Qing looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and his palm released unparalleled Yan power. Each wisp was enough to break a set of Immortal bones.

Di Qing did not stay any longer. A pair of wings with golden patterns on them suddenly appeared on his back, and he flew up into the void.

Facing the Netherworld Old Daoist, he did not release his celestial form, but flapped his wings.

In an instant, the endless Yan power burst forth like the mountains and seas!

Hundreds of millions of golden feathers, carrying an unimaginable aura, fell down like a divine punishment from the heavens!

Every golden feather was destructive, and the dead air in the sky was devoured. They also burned large, shocking holes, and everything was illuminated.

This was Di Qing’s full-strength move, a move without any reservation.

Boom!!!

Netherworld Old Daoist looked up at the destructive golden feathers and waved the horsetail whisk in his hand.

The white threads of the horsetail whisk instantly extended for thousands of miles, turning into a barrier to protect himself.

At this moment, the earth was torn apart. Countless Immortal bones were burned by the golden feathers, and even the earth was burning.

No matter how strong the boundary of the horsetail whisk that the Netherworld Old Daoist had set up with one hand was, it was still unable to resist the golden feathers that carried the power of mountains and seas.

When the boundary of the horsetail whisk was torn open, the golden feathers that filled the sky were like locusts, bombarding the Netherworld Old Daoist.

The indescribable explosion with him as the center directly tore the North Sky Heavenly Region from the middle, and the plane was about to be torn apart.

No one below the Yan Immortal realm could withstand the energy that was being released. Jian Wushuang extended his hand to protect Xi Qingchi and Zhao Ting behind him. Then, he prepared to break the formation below him without stopping.

In the next moment, an old voice that was like a large bell rang out.

“Freeze!”

Jian Wushuang, who was holding an Invisible Sword and was about to push forward, felt that his body was shackled and his control of Yan power was interrupted!

Even Di Qing, who was in the void, was affected. His body trembled and he fell to the ground uncontrollably.

The world was silent, and only the raging fire spread!

The white magic barrier of the horsetail whisk faded away, revealing the figure of the Netherworld Old Daoist.

At this time, he was in a sorry state. His gray-white skin had been burned with large holes, revealing his ghastly bones. One of his two eyeballs had also exploded, making him look even more ferocious.

“Bandit, how dare you insult me?”

He was so furious that his tattered Daoist robe and the horsetail whisk in his hand turned into ashes. “Today, I’ll definitely turn you into nourishment for my Netherworld Dharma Formation!

The deafening voice stopped. The Netherworld Old Daoist held the sword in his right hand and his left hand, which had turned into a ghastly white bone, kept making hand seals.

Immediately, the Immortal bone formation that trapped Jian Wushuang, Di Qing, and the others began to rotate slowly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Countless shattered Immortal bones floated and surged within it, carrying an extremely ferocious killing intent and death aura.

Even the Immortal bones of the countless Yan Immortals who had died in this place had been refined and turned into nutrients for the formation.

This was a fearsome array formation!

As the Netherworld Old Daoist conjured a series of hand seals, the Netherworld Dharma Formation began to fluctuate like a swamp.

The ground beneath their feet began to turn muddy. At the same time, pairs of white bone palms reached out and grabbed at Jian Wushuang and the others.

Thick divine blood gushed out and instantly surged up.

“We are all nourishment to pay tribute to the souls of my dead subordinates.” Netherworld Old Daoist chanted in a low voice. With his voice, the divine blood in the Netherworld Dharma Formation completely devoured Jian Wushuang and the others and then began to boil.

There were still Immortal bones that walked out of the Immortal graveyard. They rushed towards the formation without hesitation and integrated into it, becoming one with it and strengthening the formation.

The boiling and viscous divine blood was like a heavenly river that fell from the sky, ferocious and ugly.

Netherworld Old Daoist looked at this scene with his only remaining eye. He seemed to be very satisfied, then he moved forward.

In the next moment, the river of blood in the Netherworld Dharma Formation trembled and a figure appeared.

There was not a single blood stain on his body. He held an Invisible Sword high in his hand and drew the bow and arrow as if he was shooting the sun. The tension in his arm was at its maximum.

The next moment, the Invisible Sword was suddenly thrown out like an arrow shot from a divine bow, with an indomitable force!

Heaven and earth trembled, and the void shattered wherever the sword passed.
