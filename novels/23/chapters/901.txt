Chapter 902: Plenilune

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang rushed forward, all the while talking to the Gu King telepathically.

He had many questions about the Plenilune clan.

“Gu King, can you tell me, what abilities do the Plenilune clan have?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Their strongest ability is recovery.” The Gu King didn’t conceal anything from him.

“Their ability to recover is enough to rank top 3 among all the species in this world, including the bloodlines and Exotic Beasts.”

“And this ability to recover can not only heal physical injuries, it can also cure damage to your mind and even you soul. Most importantly, it can greatly speed up the recovery of Spiritual Power.”

“A high-level Plenilune with great strength can recover even better.”

“Speed up the recovery of Spiritual Power?” Jian Wushuang repeated, surprised.

When he was still in the Ancient God Clan, he had known that the Plenilunes could cure others. He had no idea that they had the ability to speed up the recovery of Spiritual Power.

Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, so his Spiritual Power could already recover fairly quickly. If he had the extraordinary recovery power of the Plenilune clan, perhaps he would never have to worry about using too much Spiritual Power.

“In addition to their great recovery power, the Plenilunes can also fight. Unfortunately, their fighting power is not that strong. But of course, if a Plenilune can continue to grow, and metamorphosize into a Plenilune Centipede, when he reaches his peak, he will awaken some type of Secret Skill from within his bloodline. These Secret Skills are extremely powerful against Ancient Gods.”

“A Plenilune Centipede in his peak? Isn’t that what you are?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Gu King, you have already awakened the Secret Skills, right?”

“Yes, I have,” the Gu King admitted. “It’s true I have awakened the skills, but I have no way of using them.”

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Jian Wushuang, I once told you that the Plenilune attach themselves to the Ancient Gods, and their abilities depend largely on their masters,” the Gu King began.

“As for me, I am indeed a Plenilune Centipede in my peak. If my former master was still alive, I would still be attached to him and I would be able to use my abilities. My power to fight or recover would be quite strong.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang began to think of how huge the Gu King was.

Though it is still not clear how powerful the Witch King’s recovery ability was in his peak. But with a enormous body like this, Jian Wushuang can imagine how fearful the Witch King used to be.

“But when I took you as my master and attached myself to you, my powers were greatly weakened, because you are just a One-star Ancient God!” the Gu King said seriously.

Jian Wushuang didn’t know what to say.

A One-star Ancient God was the lowest level of Ancient Gods, and was the weakest among them.

And now just because of him, the Gu King’s power had decreased?

“The One-star Ancient God is at bottom level of the Ancient God. Now I life in your body, of course my power has descended to the bottom as well.”

“Let’s put the recovery ability aside and talk about fighting power. I’m only capable of fighting against the weakest human Dao Master, and may lose if I encounter someone with greater strength. That’s because my master and I have gone through many great dangers, and also thanks to my killing Secret Skill. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even be able to fight against Eternal Realm elites.” The Gu King spoke with a hint of criticism.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang made a wry smile.

The Gu King must have been a true horror.

Just the sight of his immense body, and a Dao Master in the Eternal World would be terrified.

When Jian Wushuang heard that the Gu King was going to make him his master, he was indeed delighted. After all, the Gu King had remarkable strength, and could help him when there was danger.

But now, knowing that the Gu King ‘s strength was reduced, and that he could only fight the weakest Dao Masters, and that it was because of him, he inevitably felt a little disappointed.

“Well, it’s not that bad. After all he still has the strength of a Dao Master, and his recovery skill will be of great help.” Jian Wushuang smiled to himself.

“One more thing, Gu King. The Essence Blood of your former master is now inside me. What should I do to absorb it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Simple. Just wait. It takes a lot of time to absorb and transfer the power inside the Essence Blood,” the Gu King answered.

“That’s all I can do? Is there any way to speed it up a bit? Or can I try to absorb it all in one go? “Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Ho-ho, I suppose that would be fine if you think your life is too long.” The Gu King snorted. “Don’t you forget, Jian Wushuang, you are only a One-star Ancient God. Even if you can make a breakthrough, you will only become a Two-star Ancient God. The Essence Blood that my former master left possesses too much power, more than you could imagine.”

“And you wish to absorb it all in one breath?”

“Let me tell you something, if you attempt to do so, you may not survive. Even if you made it, such great power would not be absorbed properly. About ninety-nine percent of it would be completely wasted. You would just ruin the Essence Blood my master spent great effort gathering.”

“If you dare to do so, I will never forgive you.”

“Er...” Jian Wushuang made an awkward smile.

He had only been curious. He hadn’t been expecting an answer like this.

“The Inheritance Essence Blood my master left to you requires a long time to take in slowly. I can assure you that if you do so, you will be an elite expert in a hundred thousand years. You may not be able reach the level of my master, but you are more than capable of becoming an overlord.”

“Only a fool would do something like absorbing all the power at once.”

“Well, there is one condition in which someone can take in all the power,” the Gu King suddenly said.

“And that is?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“You would have to abandon everything you have for a slight chance of surviving this predicament,” the Gu King told him with a firm voice.

Jian Wushuang felt shock in his heart when he heard this.

It was at this time that a loud sound spread out from the void ahead.

“Is someone there?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. Then he smiled.

He flew quickly towards the sound.
