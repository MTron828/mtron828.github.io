2302 I Am Not Going

Even though Zhuo Yufeng was disappointed in Jian Wushuang and questioned Jian Wushuang’s talent in the Sword Doctrine, he did not give up.

He invited four experts who cultivated the Sword Doctrine to teach Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang cooperated obediently.

Even Lin Yi, who was an expert in Peak Chaotic Realm and ranked in the top thirty in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine within the Anjiu Prefecture, could not see how skilled Jian Wushuang was, how could these ordinary experts in the Chaotic Realm see through it? They all thought that Jian Wushuang had only just started learning how to use a sword.

Jian Wushuang would fool these experts and Zhuo Yunfeng by showing how much he “improved” every now and then.

Jian Wushuang lived and regained his power in peace.

Time flew. In the blink of an eye, two years passed.

Jian Wushuang was ten years old.

“Every century, the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion will recruit disciples. Wushuang, this is a perfect chance for you to become a powerful expert. I have already arranged for you to go and try out the recruitment test with a few other young disciples from the Lin Family,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Misty Rain Sword Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang raised his gaze.

Over the ten years since he had been reborn in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, Jian Wushuang would read the news to know more about the domain he was living in.

Jian Wushuang knew about the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion,

The Misty Rain Sword Pavilion had been created by an extremely powerful Chaotic Divine Demon who excelled at the Sword Doctrine a hundred thousand years ago. Initially, it had been a small pavilion. When the creator broke through into a whole new power level, the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion also became a top tier clan that was located around the Anjiu Prefecture.

It was extremely well known even in the Wusha Barren Region.

To any cultivators who practiced the Sword Doctrine, the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion would definitely be a good choice if they decided to go there.

“Father, I do not want to go to the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion,” Jian Wushuang rejected his father’s suggestion.

All Jian Wushuang was thinking of now was to stay here and recover his power peacefully. When he finally got back to his prime, he could venture out and join a clan of choice. Even if he were to join a clan, it would not be Misty Rain Sword Pavilion.

It was not that Jian Wushuang looked down on the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion on purpose. Once he got back his prime power, he would be a Chaotic Divine Demon. Furthermore, he was a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, hence his fighting power would easily be top-tier amongst the Chaotic Divine Demons. Misty Rain Sword Pavilion did not have the ability to guide him.

He felt that the Wusha Barren Region was too small a place for him.

Jian Wushuang had already made plans for himself. However, when Zhuo Yunfeng heard what he said, he glared at Jian Wushuang and questioned, “Brat, what did you say?”

“I said: I am not going to join the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion.” Jian Wushuang said.

“You, you...”

Zhuo Yunfeng was enraged. He pointed at Jian Wushuang and roared, “Brat! Do you know what the Misty Rain Pavilion is like? That place is a clan that focuses on the study of Sword Doctrine. There are numerous experts inside: the number of Chaotic Realm and Divine Demon experts that are there are like the number of strands of hair on a cow. There may even be an expert in a realm higher than a Divine Demon. This is a good learning opportunity for you, and now you’re telling me that you will not go there?”

“All of the geniuses in the Sword Doctrine in the Wusha Barren Region desire to enter the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion to cultivate. Now you have the chance to do so, you are telling me that you will not go?”

“Other people might want to go there, but I am not interested,” Jian Wushuang said directly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Bastard. Are you trying to make me mad?” Rage burned within Zhuo Yunfeng’s eyes. He quickly contained his anger before he said in a sincere and earnest tone, “Wushuang, I told you before that this world is not as calm and peaceful as you think. On the contrary, the Absolute Beginning Divine World is filled with danger!”

“You are only twelve years old. You may not feel it now as you have been by your parents’ side since the day you are born. One day, we will leave you. At that point in time, only you will be able to help and protect yourself. You will need power to do that!!”

“Power is the key to survival in this world. Wherever you go, people will only respect the powerful...”

“Just like your older sister and brother. They understand this. This is why your sister left a hundred over years ago, when she was fourteen, and entered a clan to cultivate. She will return once in a while. The last time she returned around twenty years ago, she was already at the Chaotic Realm.”

“You have not met your older sister before, so let us talk about your older brother, Zhuo Peng. Soon after you were born, he joined a clan to get stronger so that he could protect himself in the future...”

Zhuo Yunfeng thought that Jian Wushuang was young and did not understand how dangerous the world was. He was trying to educate Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang heard this and was speechless. Before Zhuo Yunfeng could finish speaking, Jian Wushuang interrupted and said, “Father, I understand what you are saying. However, I really do not want to go to the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion. I just want to stay at home quietly. Won’t it be the same as those four uncles who teach me about the sword doctrine every day?”

“Of course it is not the same. The four uncles are only in the Chaotic Realm. They are not proficient in their sword skills compared to the experts from the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion.”

“Father, no matter what you say, I will not go to the Misty Rain Sword Pavilion,” Jian Wushuang pursed his lips and said.

“What a defiant child!” Zhuo Yunfeng was enraged.

Luo Xinqin, who was sitting to one side, said, “Husband, since Wushuang does not want to go to the Misty Rain Pavilion, let him be. After all, he is still so young. Why not let him join a clan after a few years when he is as old as Zhuo Peng was when he left.”

“That is not a good idea. Wushuang is extremely talented. The more talented you are, the earlier you should start cultivating under the guidance of powerful experts. This will allow one to get even more powerful in the future.” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Now that Wushuang is not willing to go, what can you do? Are you going to force Wushuang to do the recruitment test?” Luo Xinqin glared at Zhuo Yunfeng.

Jian Wushuang then muttered quietly, “Even if you force me to go, I will not take the recruitment test seriously. I will not get accepted.”

Hearing this, Zhuo Yunfeng laughed bitterly and felt helpless.
