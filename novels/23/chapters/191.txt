Chapter 192: Two Monsters

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At one of the entrances to Sky Valley, the remaining six geniuses of the Tianzong Dynasty had gathered together.

“Feng Yutian, congratulations.”

“Brother Feng, you made a breakthrough before entering Sky Valley. You’re so lucky.”

“I also envy him.”

The other five people stared at Feng Yutian with smiles on their faces.

Feng Yutian suddenly felt like he could make a breakthrough. Now, he was currently in the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm.

After the breakthrough, Feng Yutian’s strength immediately soared.

The Point Battle in Sky Valley was done in groups composed of the Dynasties. The promotion of Feng Yutian’s strength would also enhance the battle strength of their team. So they were, naturally, happy to see that.

“Haha, so lucky,” said Feng Yutian while laughing naturally.

At this moment, a great figure suddenly appeared, it was Di Xi in his Imperial Robe.

“Your Majesty!”

Jian Wushuang and other five geniuses greeted him respectfully.

“Greetings to you, Monarch.” The purple-robed elder who was waiting beside them also gave him a light greeting.

“I have something to tell these guys. You’d better keep away from us for a while,” Di Xi said while glancing at the purple-robed elder.

The purple-robed elder nodded and subsequently stepped back tactfully.

“You six did very well.” Di Xi looked at Jian Wushuang and his comrades with a solemn expression and continued, “But the Point Battle in Sky Valley is different from the hunt in the first stage.”

“During the hunt in the first stage, you just battled with fugitives. Although the strength of those fugitives is strong, they aren’t a real threat to you.”

“But in the Sky Valley Point Battle, you are going to compete with the geniuses of the other 11 Dynasties!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“None of them are weaker than you. Instead, many of them are stronger than you...”

“Here is the Ranking. You’d better review it carefully.”

Di Xi gave Jian Wushuang the Rankings that he attained at the banquet.

Jian Wushuang immediately accepted it and opened it. The other five moved close to him.

The Ranking of those geniuses from the 12 Dynasties, according to the points they obtained during the five-day hunt.

Jian Wushuang read it at first glance.

“First place on the Rankings is the Meng Wutian of the Angel Empire, with 6,877 points!”

“Second place is the Ling Xueyu of the Cosmos Empire, with 5,900 points!”

“Third place is Gu Yan of the Cosmos Empire, with 1,944 points!”

“Fourth place on the Rankings, Angel Empire...”

“Fifth place, Angel Empire...”

“Sixth place, Cosmos Empire...”

At first glance, the geniuses from the first to sixth place on the Ranking were, expectedly, all from the Cosmos Empire and the Angel Empire.

It was normal for the two big Dynasties to occupy the top six on the Rankings, with each Dynasty occupying three spots on average.

Furthermore, the most important part was that the points they obtained were extremely high.

“First place, Meng Wutian, got 6,877 points? Unbelievable.”

Seeing the points, even Jian Wushuang was shocked, let alone Baili Chen and the others.

Among the six of them, Jian Wushuang was the best, but he only obtained 1,388 points.

For the others, Baili Chen had the most, with only 349 points.

However, Meng Wutian collected 6,877 points in the short five-day hunt, so what does this show?

“He should have killed at least six fugitives who were at the level of Blood Jade, and also should have killed many fugitives that are at the level of Purple Gold,” Jian Wushuang muttered in shock.

He did his best and finally killed a Blood Jade warrior. However, Meng Wutian was much stronger.

Not just Meng Wutian. It was also true for Ling Xueyu, who was in second place.

Their points were much higher than the rest. After all, Gu Yan, who ranked third, only had 1,944 points.

“How did these two people kill so many Blood Jade killers in just five days?” said Jian Wushuang while frowning tightly.

Blood Jade fugitives are at least at the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm. In a fierce battle, even Jian Wushuang was not sure he would be able to kill them. After all, they wouldn’t be stupid enough to just stand there and wait for Jian Wushuang to kill.

Once something happened, the opposite side would immediately flee, and all the Yin Void experts were able to Voidwalk. Once they began Voidwalking, there would be no way to stop them.

It was only because of good luck that Jian Wushuang killed that Blood Jade fugitive last time. The opposite side was too conceited.

But not all of the Blood Jade fugitives were conceited.

Since it was not because of luck, there should be another reason.

The reason was Meng Wutian and Ling Xueyu. They were so powerful that the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm experts never had a chance to Voidwalk. They were instantly killed.

Right now, even Jian Wushuang didn’t have such strength.

“Frightening. I thought that Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun were the strongest. It is obvious that the exceptional geniuses from two large empires are much stronger than them.”

“6,877 points, my God, how did he do that?”

Baili Chen and Feng Yutian stared at the Rankings with incredible expressions.

Especially Feng Yutian. He had made a big progress just now, so he already had much more confidence in the Sky Valley Point Battle. But now, he lost some of his confidence.

Next to them, Mu Yingying, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou also had grave expressions.

“Hey, Jian Wushuang. What is your rank?” Baili Chen added.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the list and found his rank.

“Jian Wushuang, from the Tianzong Dynasty, ninth place with 1,388 points!”

“Ninth place?” Baili Chen was astonished and then looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “You are so powerful, how come you are only ranked ninth?”

Jian Wushuang smiled briefly, but his heart was filled with astonishment.

It really was astonishing.

Among the Gold Core Realm warriors in Tianzong Dynasty, there was no doubt that he was the strongest.

However, the Tianzong Dynasty was only a small empire. Undoubtedly, the world outside Tianzong Dynasty was vast.

It was not only the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties that had countless geniuses. Some of them were not any weaker than him, and some of them were even stronger than him.

“How do you feel after reading this list?” Di Xi asked.

“I am feeling a lot of pressure,” Baili Chen answered directly, “After I made my breakthrough to Half Step Yin-Yang, my strength had soared. So I expected to rank in the top ten among the geniuses of twelve Dynasties. But, in reality, I’m not even in the top 20.”

Baili Chen noticed that he was ranked 26th on the list.

“Jian Wushuang, how do you feel?” Di Xi asked and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“It is only the Ranking for the hunt, which means nothing,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“Yes, that’s right,” Di Xi smiled slightly and continued, “This Ranking is just to show you the strength of the geniuses from the different Dynasties. It doesn’t have any other use.”
