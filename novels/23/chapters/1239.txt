Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Jin Kingdom!”

A thunder of roar echoed in the ears of all Jin Kingdom experts.

They all looked up and noticed Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang?” Holding a spear in the center of the battlefield, the Jin Kingdom monarch saw Jian Wushuang and squinted.

He could sense the change of aura on Jian Wushuang.

“Has he broken through?”

“But the battle will end soon, he is late!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch was highly confident.

In this ultimate battle, the Green Fire World was actually in a disadvantaged position. Now, they were even more imperiled. Only a small number of Green Fire World experts were still struggling.

At this time, even if he broke through, even if he was able to compete with him, so what?

The die was cast. How can Jian Wushuang alone change anything?

But at this moment, under everyone’s eyes, Jian Wushuang shook. In his sea of consciousness, the improved Soul Fire had been burning wildly. In an instant, immense Soul Power poured out like a tide.

Clang! Immaterial Soul Power swept in all directions and covered the entire battlefield like a Realm.

All experts on the battlefield could clearly sense a force around themselves.

This kind of power was strange and unreachable, but they could feel the existence of this power.

“What is he going to do?”

Many experts on the battlefield looked doubtful and failed to understand Jian Wushuang’s behaviors.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang looked ferocious with his immense killing intent.

He coldly stared at the Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield.

“All Jin Kingdom experts, die!!! ”

Just at the moment when he finished his sentence, the Soul Power that had filled the entire battlefield burst out to form numerous soul spikes. Then, they directly rushed to the nearest Jin Kingdom experts!

Massacre!

This was the largest massacre with the Soul Power!

Only people who had ignited their Soul Fire and improved it to a certain level could do this.

Before the transformation, he couldn’t display it. But when he had combined the three strongest Sword Principles, he had greatly improved his Soul Fire. Now, it was time to exert himself to display the move.

This move affected the entire battlefield. It affected all Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield.

The move contained the entire Green Fire World’s endless fury and the resentment that accumulated over the past five million years.

The move was the biggest counterattack Jian Wushuang performed at the brink of the fall of the Green Fire World!

It was one stroke that could crumble the world!!!

The soul spikes formed by the Soul Power swept every Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield. Then, they instantly pierced their skins.

Buzz! Everything was quiet.

The Soul Power attack was supposed to be silent, without any noise.

In the silence, the remaining nearly 2,000 Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield widened their eyes.

Celestial Masters and Universe Masters all gawked and froze in the middle of the air.

No one spoke, and no one made a sound. The entire battlefield fell silent.

This strange scene left the Green Fire World experts in great shock.

“What happened?”

“What happened to the Jin Kingdom experts?”

“Why are they frozen?”

People was puzzled and in doubt.

All the Jin Kingdom experts’ time seemed to pause.

Of course, this “pause” only lasted for a moment. Soon, Redsnow King in the crowd quickly regained his consciousness.

“Consciousness attack, a strong consciousness attack.” Redsnow King secretly admired, and turned around, “You…”

Behind the Red Snow King, there were supposed to be several Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm. However, when Redsnow King turned around, he grew pale.

He found they were quiet.

“De—dead?” Redsnow King was startled.

However, this was just the beginning…

Buzz… When the Soul Power completely dispersed, the world became audible again.

But at the next moment, a creepy scene appeared.

In the Void on the battlefield. Splash! Numerous bodies fell to the ground like raindrops.

After that, there was no more noise.

Too many bodies had fallen to the ground!

Originally, there were nearly 2,000 Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield, but now, nine tenths of them had turned into “raindrops” that fell to the ground.

Only those stronger Universe Masters remained above in the Void.

Within moments, among a large number of Jin Kingdom experts, only several top experts remained.

Deafening silence!

The vast world fell completely silent!

No sound was heard!

The remaining Jin Kingdom experts on the battlefield and many unaffected Green Fire World experts all looked scared, even stunned!

They all stared at the ground below.

None of the Jin Kingdom experts who fell to the ground rose up again; they stayed there forever. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Dead, they are all dead!” A Green Fire World murmured.

All Jin Kingdom experts who fell to the ground died!

None of them survived.

There had nearly been 2,000 experts, in an instant, only a few dozens of Universe Masters lasted.

All Celestial Masters had all deceased!!!

“No! !!!”

“Impossible!!! ”

“Dream, this must be a dream. I don’t accept this!”

When the remaining Jin Kingdom experts finally collected themselves, they screamed and roared.

They were roaring in disbelief.

Even the calm Jin Kingdom monarch looked terrified in disbelief.

His 2,000 Celestial Masters were killed in an instant?

What was this skill?

How did Jian Wushuang manage to use this skill?

How could he utilize such an incredible skill?

How, how did he do it!!!
