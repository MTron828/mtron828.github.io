4671 Dao Yan

When he arrived in front of the heavenly Cloud Palace, the young man in green finally felt an inexplicable tension in his heart.

The divine power was so dense that it was almost tangible, and the few of them could not breathe. The endless number of Supreme experts were like insurmountable mountains and rivers, breathtaking.

At the same time, they saw that there were several of those unimaginably terrifying existences!

In the middle of those terrifying existences sat a handsome man in white. He had an extraordinary aura.

The atmosphere was extremely tense, and cold sweat unconsciously poured out of their temples.

“You guys are finally here?” the white-robed man sitting at the head of the table said with a smile. His voice seemed to have descended from the Nine Heavens.

The young man in green finally reacted. He hurriedly cupped his hands and bowed, “Greetings, Cosmos God.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “My Young Friends, you don’t have to be so formal. We will be together for quite a long time in the future.”

“Tell me, how long have you been cultivating, and what your cultivation level is.”

The six of them nodded in agreement. The green-robed young man was the first to reply, “Replying to Cosmos God, my name is Qing Qu. I have cultivated the Dao for over 1.73 million years, and my cultivation is at the Primary Supreme realm.”

As soon as he said that, all the Supreme martial artists in the Cloud Palace looked at him with shock in their eyes.

1.73 million years to reach the Supreme realm was simply an unimaginable matter. One must know that for millions of high-level cultivators, this was merely the time they had just entered deep Enlightenment!

Even Feng Qi, Long Yan, Long Chi, and the others were a little surprised, and they all looked at the boy named Qing Qu with scrutinizing eyes.

Only Ninth Kalpa King remained calm. Perhaps becoming a Supreme martial artist in more than a million years was an unimaginable thing for all Supreme martial artists.

However, it was obviously not enough for Ninth Kalpa King, who had entered the Cloud Palace with Jian Wushuang millions of years ago.

It was because Jian Wushuang’s cultivation resume had forcibly elevated Ninth Kalpa King to another level.

The year he reached the Supreme-being level was less than 850,000 years…

“That’s right, he’s a Heaven’s Favorite.” Jian Wushuang nodded in satisfaction and then looked at the other five.

Although the cultivation path of the next five people was not as shocking as Qing Qu’s, it was still incredibly impressive.

Among them, the oldest was a middle-level cultivator who had cultivated for no more than 30 million years.

It was conceivable that these few unparalleled geniuses who had passed the Path of the Heavenly Gate would definitely grow to the Invincible Supreme realm in the future. Even the young man in green might be able to grow to the Half Ancestor realm.

Jian Wushuang asked a question with a smile after asking about the cultivation situation.

The six of them looked at each other, but then they began to talk.

Compared to the ordinary people in the mortal world, they were much more exciting and enthusiastic because they were connected to the world.

However, no matter how wonderful and passionate it was, in the near-endless years, who would follow their hearts, or even have their hearts intact?

Five answers, five seeking Immortality.

Only the young man in green had a blank look on his face from the beginning to the end. It seemed that he had no original intention since he stepped on the path of cultivation, and everything seemed to be logical until today.

“Replying to Cosmos God, I, I don’t know…”

There was silence in the heavenly Cloud Palace. All the Supreme martial artists nodded and smiled, not saying a word.

Jian Wushuang laughed. He laughed in a very pleasant manner.

After a moment, he looked at Xue Bo, who was sitting beside him. Ninth Kalpa and the others smiled and said, “Everyone, please choose your beloved disciples.”

“Yes.” Xue Bo, Ninth Kalpa, Feng Qi, Long Yan, and Long Chi cupped their hands and agreed.

The five Half Ancestors had chosen their respective candidates, but none of them had chosen the young man in green.

Disappointment appeared in his eyes. Perhaps it was the sentence ‘I don’t know’ that ruined his cultivation path.

Just as he was feeling dejected, the majestic voice rang out once more. “Qing Qu, are you willing to become my disciple?”

Qing Qu’s body trembled as he looked up at Cosmos God in disbelief. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The next moment, he knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “I am willing.”

Jian Wushuang lifted him up with a smile and said, “Don’t be so formal. From now on, you are my disciple. I will give you two words as an address.”

“I’ll listen to you, Master,” Qing Qu said excitedly.

“What do you think of the two words ‘Dao Yan’?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Qing Qu muttered a few words in his heart, then cupped his hands and said solemnly, “Disciple Dao Yan thanks Master for choosing the words.”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything more. He looked at them and said, “Sit down. I have some questions to discuss with you.”

At this point, all the Supreme experts bowed their heads and retreated, gradually retreating from the Cloud Palace.

The start of this event indicated that these six people’s future achievements would definitely not stop at the Invincible Supreme realm.

As for the green-robed young man who had been affected by the Dao of Cosmos God, no one could guess how far he would go.

Looking at the Cloud Palace that was gradually disappearing among the clouds, Feng Qi smiled faintly.

In just over two million years, the green lotus that had been sent to the lower realm had finally grown to this current state.

Two million years ago, he was a green lotus by the side of Cosmos God. Two million years later, he became a disciple of Cosmos God. Everything seemed to have been predestined.

Feng Qi turned around and pulled the Ninth Kalpa King’s sleeve, “I say, comparing the talent of the disciple that Jian Wushuang took in, how does it compare with Jian Wushuang?”

Ninth Kalpa smiled and said, “The Jian Wushuang of that year was much more terrifying than the little guy in the green robe now. He was a guy who made everyone pale in comparison to him.”

Looking at Ninth Kalpa King’s figure, Feng Qi shrugged. “That’s right. Only Jian Wushuang can make such an arrogant guy say such words.”

The clouds in the sky rolled and spread, and this prayer mat listening session continued for nearly a hundred years.

The sound of the Great Dao rang out continuously above the clouds.

When the clouds and mist in front of Cloud Palace gradually dispersed, six figures blessed with the Great Dao of heaven and earth walked out slowly.

Without exception, all of them had become Invincible Supremes.

Their eyes were no longer filled with confusion, but with their own beliefs and goals.

Since then, the six Invincible Supremes had all stayed in the heavenly Cloud Palace.

…

“Elder Xue Bo, Elder Jun Fu, aren’t you curious why I used the two words ‘Dao Yan’ on Qing Qu?”

“We didn’t understand it at first, but now we’ve been Enlightened.”

“Haha, he is Senior Brother Dao Yan’s new life, like a reincarnation. But he is no longer Senior Brother Dao Yan. In the end, he is just a place for me to entrust my respect to Dao Yan, a consolation.”

Three figures sat in a row on the top of the immortal cloud, reminiscing about the past. A long wind blew, and soon everything was covered.
