Chapter 586: The second gray stone bead!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang appeared more relaxed after the brief exchange.

However, when Emperor Xiao produced that item, Jian Wushuang was stunned and his eyes goggled.

“This, this is...” Jian Wushuang stared intently at the object.

It was a gray stone bead.

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with it because he had one inside his body.

The bead inside his body had given him the Heavenly Creation Skill and changed his life.

Now, Emperor Xiao was showing him another gray stone bead which was exactly the same as his. The most important discovery was that when the second bead was produced, Jian Wushuang could sense the one inside his body resonating with it.

Obviously, there was a strong connection between the gray stone beads.

“Kid, you recognize this bead, right?” Emperor Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile and said slowly, “Heavenly Creation Skill!”

Jian Wushuang was taken aback. He raised his head and glanced at Emperor Xiao. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jian Wushuang realized that Emperor Xiao was aware of his big secret regarding the gray stone bead and the Heavenly Creation Skill.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Senior Emperor Xiao, this gray stone bead is the same as the one inside my body, and they resonate with each other. If I’m not wrong, the bead you have should have already recorded the remaining Cultivation Method of the Heavenly Creation Skill.”

Jian Wushuang felt a hint of anticipation.

The Heavenly Creation Skill was a cultivation method that was absolutely against the natural order.

But Jian Wushuang had known that his Cultivation Method was not complete.

The highest level of his Cultivation Method was Flying to the Ninth Heaven and he was already on that level.

But Flying to the Ninth Heaven could only match ordinary warriors in the Cloud Realm.

While Cloud Realm was considered an expert level in the Divine Land, it was merely average in the Monster Continent and just ordinary in the Ancient World.

There should be another level above the Cloud Realm.

Like the three tribes in the Divine Land, the Temple Masters of the human population in the Monster Continent were at levels higher than the experts in the Cloud Realm.

In the Ancient World, the Realm above the Cloud Realm was called the Skyscraping Realm!

It was above Nine Heaven.

It was possible for an ordinary warrior to be in the Skyscraping Realm. Therefore, the Heavenly Creation Skill should have another Cultivation Technique which was higher than Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

“You are right.”

Emperor Xiao confirmed Jian Wushuang’s hypothesis. “My gray stone bead does have the remaining Realms’ Cultivation Technique of the Heavenly Creation Skill.”

Having heard Emperor Xiao’s confirmation, Jian Wushuang’s excitement showed in his eyes as his gaze returned to the bead.

“Kid, take it easy, I will give you the bead eventually, but not now,” Emperor Xiao said.

Jian Wushuang tried hard to conceal his excitement. He took a deep breath and said, “Senior, may I ask if you created the Heavenly Creation Skill?”

Jian Wushuang had wanted to ask this question for a long time.

He really wanted to know who had created the Heavenly Creation Skill.

It was impressive to have created this incredible Heaven defying cultivation method!

As he considered Emperor Xiao’s strength and his possession of the gray stone bead, Jian Wushuang realized that it was likely that he had created the Heavenly Creation Skill.

However, to his surprise, Emperor Xiao shook his head. “This Heavenly Creation Skill is very occult, it’s not something that I can make. It was created by one of my old friends.”

“Old friend?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Emperor Xiao started to explain.

“We’re very close, like Demon and Pythias. His strength is a bit greater than mine. This Heavenly Creation Skill was made by him!”

“He passed away after creating the Heavenly Creation Skill. What a pity.”

“Before he died, he had separated the Heavenly Creation Skill into two parts and recorded them into two gray stone beads. He gave me one and threw the other into the space. He told me to give this bead to the person who cultivates the Heavenly Creation Skill in the Nine-cloud Realm. That person would be his successor.”

“After he died, I followed the first gray stone bead to the space and arrived at the Ancient World. While waiting here, I built a Tang of the East in the Nanyang Continent. I’ve been here for thousands of years.”

“Finally, you are here and you’ve used the Heavenly Creation Skill to become an invincible warrior.”

Emperor Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed.

He was well aware of the gray stone bead inside his body and the unique Heavenly Creation Skill, but he had never expected that Emperor Xiao had been waiting for him for thousands of years in the Ancient World.

“When you broke through the Saint Realm and became a Venerable Master, I had already noticed you. From that moment on, I watched you. I know all about your encounters and progress.” Emperor Xiao smiled and continued, “Previously, I thought that you would need more time to reach the Nine-cloud Realm. To my surprise, you broke through it when you got the opportunity from God Hong in the Earth Core Palace.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Emperor Xiao knew about the opportunity in the Fifth Level of the Earth Core Palace.

And he also knew God Hong?

Jian Wushuang didn’t know that Emperor Xiao’s powers were god-like. He knew every single thing that Jian Wushuang did, including his encounter in the Fifth Level of the Earth Core Palace.

“Although God Hong’s strength is average, the Immortality Secret Skill is still useful for you, but just barely,” Emperor Xiao said.

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang was inwardly surprised.

God Hong in the Fifth Level of the Earth Core Palace had only displayed a fraction of his skills, but that had already terrified Jian Wushuang.

The Immortality Secret Skill was an incredible Secret Skill which had filled Jian Wushuang with incredulity.

But Emperor Xiao appeared to take God Hong’s skills lightly, and he commented the Immortality Secret Skill was just passable?

“Since you are the successor of my old friend, I will try to help you.”

“Before, I thought you would need more time to break through, so I prepared something for you. But I can save it since you’ve already succeeded. When the time is right, I will take you to join the Firmament Territory Feast,” Emperor Xiao said.
