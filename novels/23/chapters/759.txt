Chapter 760: The Ancient God Token

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Tianqi Mountains, there were two figures running forward one after the other.

It was Jian Wushuang and An Chao. Jian Wushuang was only a hundred meters from An Chao.

At this distance it would be less difficult for him to deal with An Chao.

“Secret Skill— Mind-controlling Secret Skill!”

He displayed the skill. An Chao immediately felt as if there was a sharp stinger stabbing him inside his head.

“Aaaagh!”

He let out a scream of pain and stopped running involuntarily.

Jian Wushuang closed the distance between them in an instant.

“Die!”

He shouted and struck. An Chao was still in confusion from the pain. He was hit before he could even struggle.

His head was chopped off and his Life Core was destroyed as well.

He was killed on the spot. Finally, the criminal who had caused Jian Wushuang to be trapped in the Eternal Zone for a hundred years was dead.

Jian Wushuang stopped fighting and stood in the void silently.

He looked down at An Chao’s body coldly.

“Brother Gu Qiong, I finally killed An Chao for you.”?Jian Wushuang clenched his hand, but in his heart he was relaxed.

He had been living with his hatred for An Chao and his guilt for Gu Qiong’s death all those years.

He could finally live in peace.

He smashed An Chao’s body into pieces. He looked around. After finding there was no one around, he left.

However, not long after he left, a figure appeared where he had been standing.

It was Ming Ye, a grey-haired elder from the Nine Heaven Sect.

”?An Chao?, the expert from the Boundless Demon Sect, was killed?”

The elder could not believe it.

“And the one who killed him was Jian Wushuang, the peerless genius of the Ancient Sect and Xuan Yi’s disciple.

“I can’t believe he is even still alive.

“More than that, he has grown so powerful. An Chao was an ordinary expert for his level, yet he was in the Eternal Realm. How could he be killed without struggle?”?

Ming Ye’s eyes were open wide.

The image of Jian Wushuang killing An Chao kept flashing in his mind. He had hidden nearby when it happened and witnessed the entire thing.

He could even recall the desperate scream An Chao let out right before he died.

“A hundred years ago, when the news that Jian Wushuang was trapped in the Eternal Zone spread, Xuan Yi was extremely angry about it. It was only after killing seven of the Cloud Sea Asgard’s Eternal Realm experts and the other two magnates giving him ten million Divine Gems as compensation, that he finally stopped pursuing the matter.?

“At that time, we all thought Jian Wushuang dead. No one dared to enrage Xuan Yi again. All the sects gave him their gems no matter how unwilling they were.?

“Now, it turns out Jian Wushuang is still alive.?

“If the three magnates find out, there’s no way they’ll they let it go. Especially the Cloud Sea Asgard.

“It seems there will be plenty of fun waiting for us once we get out of the Eternal Zone.”

With this in mind, Ming Ye left.

After killing An Chao, Jian Wushuang went back to the Baptismal Pools. Gu Yang and others who had received the signal asking for help were waiting there.

“Master.”

They saluted Jian Wushuang.

“Gu Yang, where are the other two men?” Jian Wushuang asked.

When the three Boundless Demon Sect experts had started to flee, he had chosen to chase after An Chao.

The other two experts had been left to Gu Yang and the other clansmen.

“Those outsiders can move so fast and they’re good at defending. I shot one of them down and killed him, but the other one escaped,” Gu Yang answered.

“You killed one of them?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

What Gu Yang said about the outsiders was true. They were indeed good at defending and it was hard to kill them.

Because he had the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang could have killed some of the outsiders, but most of the Ancient God clansmen were not fast.

Few of them had managed to kill an outsider.

Given that, it was good of Gu Yang to kill one.

“The one you killed, show me his Interspatial Ring,” Jian Wushuang ordered.

“Here you are.” Gu Yang handed it to him.

Jian Wushuang searched carefully inside the ring. He found a detailed map of the Tianqi Mountains, and his look brightened

“Haha, how lucky we are!” He laughed happily.

He found what he had failed to find in Xia Yuan’s and An Chao’s Interspatial Rings before.

On the map, he saw a few places had been carefully marked and assumed they were the Boundless Demon Sect’s assembly sights.

The map was similar to the one he had gotten from Wu Dao.

Obviously, its owner had taken it with him for the same reason—it was his first time in the Tianqi Mountains.

“I already know the assembly sites of the Cloud Sea Asgard and Boundless Demon Sect. And now…”??Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He took a token out from the ring and gave it back to Gu Yang.

Since Gu Yang had killed the outsider all by himself, Jian Wushuang would not take the ring.

“Gu Yang, this is an Ancient God Token,” Jian Wushuang handed him a token. “Use it to send a message to gather all the clansmen here. I have some orders to give.”

“Yes, master.”

Gu Yang nodded heavily and immediately sent out the message.
