Chapter 276: You Will Die

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’m Dong Yu from the Bloodseeker Gang,” the purple-clothed woman said while staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked toward her.

Dong Yu had reached the Yang Void Realm and was accompanied by several experts of the Yin Void Realm.

“I heard that you killed Qing Ling and Qing Hai with one stroke. I know you’re powerful, so I came to invite you to join our Bloodseeker Gang,” Dong Yu said directly.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his brow and immediately asked, “who is the leader of your Bloodseeker Gang?”

“Our leader is Bloodseeker Xiao Gang. Everyone around Devil Heart City knows him,” Dong Yu replied with a hint of pride.

After hearing this name, Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had an excellent memory, so he had already memorized the 1000 top experts’ names after reading through the list. Obviously, there was no one called Xiao Gang.

Jian Wushuang could not take Xiao Gang seriously, because the man had not climbed into the list.

“Sorry, I’m not interested.” Jian Wushuang refused straightforwardly.

Dong Yu looked disappointed and said again, “You must know that Qing Ling and Qing Hai belonged to the Hungry Wolf Gang. Based on their history, they will come to pick a fight with you. I’ve seen the experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang outside when I came here. If you go with me, you might have a chance to survive.

“Or... You will die as soon as you step outside.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “I desperately want to know how I will die.”

“Since you’ve made up your mind, I don’t need to persuade you. See you.” Dong Yu immediately left with her people.

“You should have accepted her invitation,” the attendant said. “She is right. The Hungry Wolf Gang is quite powerful in Devil Heart City. It is led by six leaders and all of them are experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm so they’re extremely aggressive. If you kill their people, they will definitely kill you, so you’d better join the Bloodseeker Gang which can fight against the Hungry Wolf Gang.”

“All of the six chiefs are at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm? I wonder how many experts they have on the list?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“None.” The attendant shook his head.

On hearing that, Jian Wushuang gave a faint smile without saying a word. He took out a pot of wine from his Interspatial Ring and drank alone. After an hour, he was about to leave the Bloodmoon Hotel.

“Good luck,” the attendant said.

Jian Wushuang smiled. The moment he walked out of the hotel, he immediately perceived that he was targeted by many people.

“Waiting to kill me.”?Jian Wushuang thought with a faint smile on his face.

The Bloodmoon Hotel enjoyed unusual status in the whole Tang Dynasty.

When he had stayed in the hotel, experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang did not dare to start a fight. If they broke a stool, they would pay 100 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid, so they were afraid that a fierce fight would cost too much.

Once Jian Wushuang left the hotel, the experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang would not have such concerns.

“Hum, Missed the chance to live. Now... Let’s see how he courts death.”

Under the eaves of a shabby house, Dong Yu and some experts of the Bloodseeker Gang stood there and fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

Crack!

As the crack of the wine bowl explosion came out, dozens of figures appeared around Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang was targeted by their killing intent. Dozens of strokes slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

When he raised his head, he found himself being blocked by those figures and had no opportunity to escape.

In fact, he did not need to escape.

The Triple-kill Sword on Jian Wushuang’s back was unsheathed, with a blast of roaring Sword Essence. Then a streak of sword light shone so brightly that the attackers could not help but close their eyes.

The streak of sword light easily passed by the attackers.

Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

Those attackers fell one by one and were instantly killed.

Chuu! Chuu! Chuu!

The three blasts of sound pierced the air, as if they converged into one.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and suddenly stepped back. Three strokes just passed by him, crashed into the ground, and immediately exploded. Jian Wushuang found that these were three hidden arrows. With black liquid on the arrow tips, these arrows were highly toxic.

“Hehe, how clever!.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and disappeared instantly.

The next moment, boom!

Like a bomb, a figure violently hit the ground in the center of the street. It was a short and thin man, who looked gloomy. The man held a bow. Obviously, the three toxic arrows were shot by him.

“Are these all you can do? Anything else?” It was Jian Wushuang’s voice.

Boom!

Behind his back, the Void suddenly split and a Giant Axe of raging fire slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

“An expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm still needs to attack sneakily?” Jian Wushuang had a faint smile and turned around to block it.

Peng!

A loud boom made the strong man who held the Giant Axe retreat, while Jian Wushuang was still standing there.

“What?”

The strong man was shocked when he saw Jian Wushuang easily block his stroke.

“He’s... the sixth leader of the Hungry Wolf Gang?” Dong Yu and other experts of the Bloodseeker Gang were startled.

“The Peak of the Yang Void Realm, you must be a chief of the Hungry Wolf Gang?” Jian Wushuang looked toward the strong men with cold eyes. “Your Hungry Wolf Gang is really great. But sorry, you pissed off the wrong man.”

As soon as he finished his words, Jian Wushuang had already disappeared.

“Where?” The strong man kept vigilant for a sudden attack.

The moment a cold streak of sword shadow suddenly appeared in front of him, the strong man immediately waved his Giant Axe to block it with his full strength. However, the streak of sword shadow changed into three strokes. When he managed to block only one of them, the other two strokes pierced his chest and belly.

“You, You dare to kill me?” The strong man widened his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang. “My brother, my brother will take revenge for me.”

“Your brother? I’ll give him a chance.”

Jian Wushuang wore a cold smile, which was as cruel as a blade.
