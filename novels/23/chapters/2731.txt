Chapter 2732: One More Opportunity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Old Gu was chattering away casually while Jian Wushuang and the other four were stunned to hear his stories.

Old Gu was telling the group how powerful those experts around them were but they were unable to fathom that knowledge since they could not imagine those expert’s strength level.

The group finally grasped the idea of how powerful those deceased experts were when Sword Lord Tong Xin was mentioned.

Everyone in the group of five had heard of Sword Lord Tong Xin—he was an unrivaled Undying Saint.

Especially Jian Wushuang, he knew a little more about Sword Lord Tong Xin compared to the others since Jian Wushuang owned the first four stages of the Transmigration Sword Formation.

It was not an exaggeration to claim that Sword Lord Tong Xin was the most powerful Undying Saint borne in the territories of Nine Realms of Golden Crow in millions of years.

However, such an existence was looked down upon by Old Gu.

Sword Lord Tong Xin did not even have the qualifications to be placed in the cemetery. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In other words, any of those dozens of experts in the cemetery were much stronger than Sword Lord Tong Xin.

However, they were killed easily by Old Gu’s master.

“Old Gu’s master must’ve surpassed the Undying Saint realm,” muttered Jian Wushuang.

The group of people soon reached the front of the cemetery and saw two stone coffins that were obviously taller and more unique than the rest.

Those two Stone coffins were more than 30 feet long. Not only were they larger in size, but also came with a lot of restrictions around them.

There were also two cold corpses laid to rest in the two stone coffins, but they were unable to see the corpses’ appearance because of the restrictions in place.

“Old Gu, did your master kill these two experts as well?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, both of them were killed by my master. They were much stronger than the ones you just saw as they are both Law Lords.” Old Gu smiled.

“Law Lords?” Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear that.

Saber Master was also shocked.

They might not have heard of Law Lords but they figured that Law Lords must have been above Undying Saints.

They had no idea how powerful a Law Lord was but they figured that Law Lord must be much more powerful than an Undying Saint.

Old Gu’s master not only had killed those invincible Undying Saints but also killed two Law Lords. The master’s cultivation realm was obviously at the Law Lord realm at least and possibly a top-rated Law Lord.

Old Gu leaped forward and a towering throne soon appeared out of thin air. He sat on the throne while looking down at Jian Wushuang and the others with interest.

“Now, the five of you must’ve come to this secret realm for the many opportunities and treasures left by my master, right?” Old Gu smiled.

“Yes.” The group of five did not deny the fact.

“Haha, my master did leave behind many opportunities when my master created this secret realm such that even his greatest inheritance is here. However, my master’s realm is too high and you are merely at the Grand Ultimate God realm. Let’s not talk about my master’s inheritance, you’re not even qualified to go through the tests left behind by my master. It’s out of pure luck that you can get up till here,” said Old Gu.

Jian Wushuang and the rest turned slightly pale.

“Don’t be upset. What my master left behind isn’t something minor Grand Ultimate Gods like you can handle—those trials included. You must at least be an Undying Saint to undergo the trials and even then only extremely powerful Undying Saints that meet my master’s requirement can go through a level or two. However, none of you are qualified to do so.

“If I wasn’t bored and deliberately made it easy for all of you, you won’t even be able to get through those several places of crisis set up along the way. You won’t even be able to make it up to here,” added Old Gu.

Jian Wushuang was startled.

He finally understood all the dangers they encountered along the way were controlled by Old Gu.

Every type of danger they encountered was in Old Gu’s palm. In the first cemetery, Old Gu was the one who decides whether they would encounter any corpse puppets including the type of corpse puppets.

As for the two Interspatial Rings they got at the beginning, Old Gu must have deliberately placed them there.

Old Gu continued after a short pause. “In fact, there are many opportunities my master left behind in this secret realm. For example, this cemetery you’re in now has dozens of experts in the coffins. Apart from the experts that my master particularly valued, the treasures that used to belong to these experts are kept in place. You can get them if you’re capable but unfortunately, none of you are powerful enough to get close to the coffins.”

Jian Wushuang and the others exchanged embarrassed looks with each other as they agreed with Old Gu.

They had indeed failed to reach out for the great opportunities laid before them.

“Don’t be disheartened. Each of you has previously gotten an opportunity. As for now...I’ll give you one more opportunity because of the difficulties you went through to get here,” said Old Gu casually.

Jian Wushuang and the rest had their eyes lit up all of a sudden.

Old Gu smiled and flipped his hand as an Interspatial Ring appeared in his hand.

Old Gu asked, “Can you see this? The items in this Interspatial Ring will be the last you can get from this secret realm. They were nothing to my master, but are definitely considered great treasures to Grand Ultimate Gods such as you and even ordinary Undying Saints. Now...”

Old Gu cracked a strange smile before he slid one hand across the air and a spatial passage appeared out of thin air before Old Gu threw the Interspatial Ring into it.

“I’ve thrown the Interspatial Ring into the other end of the spatial passage somewhere in a vast dark void. The five of you can enter this spatial passage and start searching in the dark void. I’ll give you three hours, whoever finds the Interspatial Ring and brings it out within three hours shall be the new owner of the Interspatial Ring.

“However, don’t blame me if you fail to locate the Interspatial Ring within three hours.”

Old Gu smiled indifferently as the spatial passage grew bigger under his control.

“Now, go on.”
