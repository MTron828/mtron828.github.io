Chapter 1249: Back in Chillywind Valley

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Within a towering palace, a row of thrones stood. All the remaining Green Fire World Palace Masters gathered here.

At that time, because of the Nirvana Elixirs, the Green Fire World brought forth more than 20 Palace Masters. Nevertheless, after the previous battle, only seven people survived!

Naturally, Jian Wushuang led the rest seven Palace Masters.

“Palace Master Yun, my teacher gave me a Formation, and I want to know that if you can arrange it.” Jian Wushuang handed the Jade Slip containing the Formation to Palace Master Yun and said, “My teacher said, once this Formation is arranged, our Green Fire World will be safe and sound.”

Upon hearing this, Palace Master Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement, and then, he carefully studied the Formation.

“Tang Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang turned to Tang Emperor beside him. “The battle between our Green Fire World and the Jin Kingdom has ended. The remaining Dao Masters can return home. In addition, a large number of experts have fallen. This is bound to influence the forces in our world, especially the Samsara Temple’s and Void Temple’s force!”

“Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master fought to the death. We won’t win the war without them. Although they were gone, we have to take care of their soldiers!”

“And experts that decreased during the war, we won’t let them die in vain!”

“I hope you can arrange them for me!”

“Yes, I will.” Tang Emperor nodded slightly.

“Father.” Jian Wushuang looked to Jian Nantian again. “In this battle, some of the Jin Kingdom experts escaped, but they can’t escape from this battlefield. They must hide in this battlefield. The Jin Kingdom has been destroyed, they won’t survive long. I want you and other Palace Masters to find them and kill them for me!”

“If we don’t remove them, sooner or later, they will be a big trouble for our Green Fire World.”

“Yes, I will.” Jian Nantian accepted the mission.

At this time, Palace Master Yun raised his head again, and his eyes appeared vicious.

“Wushuang Palace Master, I’ve studied the Formation you gave me. Although it is very difficult and cumbersome, given adequate time and sufficient resources, I guarantee I’ll arrange this Formation. Once it was arranged, indeed, as Master Xuan Yi said, our Green Fire World will be safe and sound. Even forces ten times stronger than the Jin Kingdom can’t break into this battlefield again.” Palace Master Yun said excitedly.

“Great.” Hearing Palace Master Yun, other Palace Masters all became pleasantly surprised.

Jian Wushuang faintly smiled. “Palace Master Yun, then I will trouble you to arrange the Formation. If you need material resources, you can fetch them in the Fire Point Exchange Office. If the resources run out, just inform me.”

Jian Wushuang killed the Jin Kingdom monarch and a lot of Jin Kingdom experts. Thus, he received countless treasure resources.

Although he had put most of the treasures in Fire Point Exchange Office, he kept some rare treasures that were not helpful for Green Fire World to himself. Thus, he had plenty of rare treasures in his hands.

“No problem, you’ll see.” Palace Master Yun smiled confidently.

The war ended, everything quieted down.

Jian Wushuang and several Palace Masters discussed and arranged other affairs.

Then, Jian Wushuang headed to the vast battlefield. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He was heading to Chillywind Valley. Back then when he was hunted by Red Snow King and others, Jian Wushuang’s first Original Body was forced to die here.

Now Jian Wushuang visited it again.

“This Chillywind Valley is quite weird. There must be treasures that are extremely cold underneath. Unfortunately, I was too weak to enter the bottom of the valley. Now I’ve improved, I might as well have a try.” Looking at the unfathomable huge pit in front of him, Jian Wushuang was expectant.

Of course, although he was quite confident about his current strength, Jian Wushuang remained careful. He first waited quietly outside the sinkhole.

Soon… Boom… The land shook.

“It’s coming!” Jian Wushuang’s face lit up.

As the shake grew stronger and stronger, a horrifying Blood Coldwind blew fiercely.

It was a wind that could easily smash Universe Masters. He used to avoid it, but now, even when the Blood Coldwind was in full swing, he still stepped forward and entered within its range.

Boom!

The strong breeze washed over Jian Wushuang with terrifying force.

Frowning, Jian Wushuang endured the fierce gale. He was still on his feet when the Blood Coldwind died down…

“I was right. My current body, coupled with the Blood-killing Plate Armor’s defense, allowed me to withstand the Blood Coldwind.?” Jian Wushuang grinned.

He had combined the three strongest Sword Principles and obtained the Immortal Divine Body, which was far more mighty than a normal Universe Master’s.

He had cultivated a Protective Secret Skill “Golden Image”. He was at the second stage of the Secret Skill and thus acquired powerful defensive skills.

Moreover, he had the Blood-killing Plate Armor that had weakened the impact of the Blood Coldwind by more than nine tenths.

These three means combined to make his defensive ability to surge. His defensive power was far stronger than that of ordinary Universe Gods. Thus, he was able to resist the Blood Coldwind.

Knowing that the Blood Coldwind could not pose a threat to him, Jian Wushuang immediately swept toward the bottom of the Chillywind Valley.

All the way down, he contained his speed. But after a short while, he was already more than 100,000 miles deep under the ground.

“It’s been 100,000 miles, but I still can’t see the end of the valley. The Chillywind Valley is really deep enough.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

But at this time, his Soul Power that had been released before, suddenly found something floating below.

It was a gold gourd.

“That’s…”

Seeing the gold gourd, Jian Wushuang’s face lit up.

At the next moment, his figure appeared in front of the gold gourd and stretched to seize it.

“It’s really my Blaze Quicksand Gourd!”

Jian Wushuang rejoiced over his founding. The moment he held it in his hands, he sensed something in his heart.

This was the Blaze Quicksand Gourd that he lost in this Chillywind Valley. Although he lost it, he did not cancel his ownership on the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. Thus, when he held it, Jian Wushuang felt something.

“I’ve found my Blaze Quicksand Gourd. If I go deeper into the bottom of this Chillywind Valley…” Jian Wushuang squinted to scrutinize the bottom of the valley that seemed endless and frowned.

The bottom of the valley scared him. As he got closer and closer to the bottom, the horror grew stronger and stronger.
