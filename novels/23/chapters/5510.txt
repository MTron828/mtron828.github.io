Chapter 5509 ¬†Master of All Things

In the future, he would definitely have to meet the mysterious Temple Master Xuan Yi.

As for the Envoy of All Things, Jian Wushuang had investigated and found it to be nothing more than a puppet. It possessed no extraordinary capabilities; a single sword strike could easily shatter it.

However, this particular Envoy of All Things manipulated the entire Origin Source of the Universe. In specific realms, it could unleash various layers of combat power.

At the highest level was the complete master of All Things.

That was the true definition of strength.

Perhaps, within the Qishen Temple, no one could reach the pinnacle.

The master of All Things was one of the three Divine Masters, on par with the primordial Divine Masters. It surpassed even the Three Kings in strength.

It stood at the peak among the Universe Masters, slightly weaker only than Qishen.

Exploring the Origin Source of such a formidable being was indeed worth his efforts.

Once he finished exploring this planet, he would contemplate the Origin Source of All Things.

He wanted to see what the Origin Source was like at the level of the Universe Master.

After breaking through so many layers, he had gained countless insights.

At least a hundred million times.

With each doubling of layers, he had now surpassed 30 floors.

Who knew how many times!

After Jian Wushuang sensed the changes in this planet, he once again killed the Envoy of All Things with a single sword strike.

Afterwards, for each layer he ascended, he would contemplate for a year, continuously tormenting the Envoy of All Things.

Soon, he reached the 50th floor, his 40th breakthrough.

The current Envoy of All Things had reached the level of a tier 6 Emperor.

It was no longer possible to easily trample over it.

"Hehe, kid, are you still my match now?" the Envoy of All Things sneered.

Jian Wushuang revealed a faint smile. Without the mastery of the power of Life, he indeed only possessed the strength of a tier 6 Emperor. However, things were different now.

"Universe!" Jian Wushuang uttered this word indifferently, and the entire planet dimmed.

In a forest, a squirrel was stealthily nibbling on a bright red fruit, looking around and wondering why the day turned dark so quickly.

However, soon after, a force descended, and the squirrel transformed into a skeletal frame. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

The skeleton sank into the ground, turning into a fossil.

In the blink of an eye, countless years passed.

Everything was changing, but Jian Wushuang remained unaffected.

"Finally, I can integrate the Life power into the universe. From now on, unleashing the One Thought Universe won't be so monotonous!" Jian Wushuang raised his hand, and the heavens and earth returned to their original state.

The squirrel in the forest paused, then dropped the fruit and ran away.

Jian Wushuang sensed everything around him.

The One Thought Universe had shrunk to the size of a palm, binding the Envoy of All Things.

Outside.

In the hall of the Beiwang Tower.

Tens of thousands of strong individuals had gathered here.

They anxiously awaited the changes in rankings, but their focus was solely on Jian Wushuang.

Dao Lord: Jian Wushuang, broke through to the 40th level.

Even Wanyan, who was initially calm, became excited. He knew that Jian Wushuang had the strength to reach the 40th level, but what happened beyond that was unknown.

He himself had only reached the 53rd level, and Jian Wushuang had already reached the 50th level, taking a whole year for each breakthrough.

This pattern was noticed by everyone.

Even the old man guarding this place kept a constant eye on Jian Wushuang.

Now, Jian Wushuang's reputation was established.

Many Inheritors believed that Jian Wushuang hadn't been taken away by someone initially but had been placed into a special inheritance by Zhen Ling. Now, after coming out, his strength had reached an unimaginable level.

Dao Lord possessed the battle power of a tier 6 Emperor.

They did not even dare to think about it.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang, ranking first, once again transformed, breaking through the 41st level.

"It's still within a year!" someone exclaimed.

They were on the verge of collapse.

Jian Wushuang broke through right on time every time, but what happened inside during that year?

Some speculated that Jian Wushuang had a special Temporal Treasure that allowed him to pass through at will.

Some even reported to the higher-ups in the Elder Palace, but the response received was that there were no changes in the Beiwang Tower; it was just that Jian Wushuang's strength was too formidable.

The news of Jian Wushuang breaking through the 41st level spread once again.

This time, Old Daoist Qingniu, one of the three Palace Masters of the Elder Palace, came in person.

He faintly ranked first among the three Palace Masters, holding the pinnacle of power in the Elder Palace.

Many people, upon seeing him, hurriedly went forward to pay their respects.

Whether it was the Inheritors or the native emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms, they all highly respected this old Daoist with a kind face.

Wu Zuo's figure appeared here at some point. He deliberately concealed his aura, and only Qingniu noticed his presence.

"Wu Zuo, my friend, I heard that Jian Wushuang still has some connection with you?" Qingniu casually remarked.

If that were true, he needed to invest early.

Jian Wushuang had such potential; he would undoubtedly become a significant figure in the Qishen Temple in the future. It was wise to curry favor with him in advance.

However, Wu Zuo paid no attention to this. He understood the other's thoughts but sneered inwardly.

Only he could get on Jian Wushuang's boat; the rest shouldn't even think about it.

Once that plan was set in motion, these people would go after Jian Wushuang.

Trying to please him now would be of no use.

When the plan was ready, Zhen Ling coordinated with it and directly commanded them to hunt down Jian Wushuang. These individuals, it seemed, would likely add insult to injury.

After the completion of the plan, Jian Wushuang naturally wouldn't harbor any goodwill towards these people.

Instead, having been involved in the plan and having preemptively aligned with Jian Wushuang, he would be remembered for his favor when Jian Wushuang reached the summit.

"Palace Master, I've only had a few chance encounters with Jian Wushuang; we're not acquainted!" Wu Zuo replied.

Old Daoist Qingniu paused for a moment. He knew Wu Zuo well. Before entering the Qishen Temple, he had a notorious reputation and was subdued by a Zhen Ling, obedient and submissive.

Later, he clung to Zhen Ling's thigh, but now he seemed confused and had actively distanced himself from Jian Wushuang.

There must be some conspiracy!

'Could it be that he wants me to voluntarily dispel this notion?' Qingniu thought inwardly, then revealed a strange smile and said, "Jian Wushuang's talent is outstanding. He must be someone favored by Zhen Ling. After he comes out, my Elder Palace will show support. If others disagree, I can act independently!"

Upon hearing this, Wu Zuo inwardly cursed. Qingniu had said all the favorable words. Clearly, the other party didn't believe that he had no special relationship with Jian Wushuang. This was a message for him to convey to Jian Wushuang!

Unfortunately, Wu Zuo was no longer so foolish. He wouldn't be manipulated by these old guys.

What's the use of treasures?

How many treasures could these old guys produce?

He had invested all his worth in Jian Wushuang.

Did these people have such determination?

"Brother Qingniu, you better convey these words to Jian Wushuang yourself!" Wu Zuo said and immediately left.

He had no positive feelings towards these Palace Masters now.

He had done both good and bad things, gained nothing in the end, and had to face blame every time, with them pushing him forward.

As for Emperor Lu Hua, who had a life-and-death relationship with him and helped him become a Palace Master, there was no news from him now.
