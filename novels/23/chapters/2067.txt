2068 Kill Him On-the-Spot!

“That Eight-star Ancient God just mentioned that experts of the Gu Clan should be hiding in Luo Wang City. That city’s controlled by King Luo Yu if I’m not mistaken. Let me ask him,” Jian Wushuang took out the transmission token King Luo Yu had given him previously.

“King Luo Yu, Jian Wushuang here,” the message was sent.

“Oh Sword Emperor, you’re here at the Ancient God Sanctuary?” a reply soon followed.

“Yea. I heard there’s been a brawl within the Ancient God Clan. I immediately made my way here from the human domain, visiting Gu King City too. But Gu King City’s no longer under the Gu Clan? What happened? How’re the brothers King Gu You and Gu Tong?”

“It’s a long story, I better save it for when we meet. Regarding the brothers, they’re within my city walls. Ping me your location, and I’ll get them to pick you up,” King Luo Yu replied.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded and sent his location, waiting in the Void near Gu King City as time passed.

…...

At the Ancient God Sanctuary, within the vast Void, lay a huge floating architectural complex.

Within this complex, at its centre, there was a palace one could not possibly not notice.

Within that palace, a three-meter-tall middle-aged man in chrome battle armour sat on the towering throne. This man was stone-faced, but the ferocious aura visible through his eyes was enough to startle one. But his most eye-catching feature, was the nine stars between his eyebrows!

A Nine-star Ancient God, was equivalent to a Great Emperor-level expert amongst the humans.

But he was not King Luo Yu, it was another within the Ancient God Clan, the much older King Chen Xing.

“Hmm?”

King Chen Xing’s expression had changed. He had received the notice from that eight-star Ancient God within Gu Wang City.

“Gu Jian? A being just arrived from the human domain, but within lies a bloodline purer and better than the Royal Ancient God Clan?”

“Sword Emperor!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

King Chen Xing immediately lifted his head.

“Sword Emperor, whom Luo Yu tried so hard to push to become the new Ancient God Emperor, has finally arrived at my Ancient God Sanctuary?”

“Hngh, so what if your bloodline is pure? The Ancient God Emperor of the Clan will only be one, the rest can forget about it.”

“Besides, this Sword Emperor is of human descent, and was not born within the Ancient God Clan. He is so much closer to humans than to us, what right does he have to become the Ancient God Emperor?”

In the Ancient God Clan, bloodline preceded everything else. That was the rule.

Most people agreed with this rule, but to those elite experts, all rules could be bent, as long as you had enough strength.

Any rule could be bent with power.

The fact that King Chen Xing did not recognise Jian Wushuang’s bloodline, was not only due to his human descent, but also because deep in his heart, he only acknowledged one Ancient God Emperor.

“Zhan Cang!” King Chen Xing shouted.

“King Chen Xing.”

At the bottom of the palace came a stocky, tanned, gorilla-like man.

“The Sword Emperor has appeared, just beside Gu Wang City. Bring someone over and invite him here,” King Chen Xing instructed.

“Invite him?” the gorilla-like man was stunned.

“Of course we’ll invite him, but the way to invite? You should know how. If you can’t do it, kill him on the spot.” King Chen Xing’s eyes were filled with ferocity.

“Aye,” Zhan Cang nodded solemnly.

Soon he took off with his finest men.

…...

...

The Void outside Gu Wang City.

Jian Wushuang waited quietly for a full fortnight.

Sou! Sou!

Two figures appeared in front of Jian Wushuang’s line of sight. They were the brothers King Gu You and Gu Tong.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang.”

King Gu Tong had interacted with Jian Wushuang several times, and they were on good terms. A refreshing smile greeted Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor.” King Gu You was obviously more reserved.

“Hope y’all are doing fine,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

They made some small talk.

“Gents, Gu Wang City… what happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“What else, we got attacked.” King Gu Tong shrugged.

“The people in control of the city now, they were enough against the both of you two?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He knew clearly, King Gu You had long ago attained the Eight-star Ancient God expert level, equivalent to a Peak Universe God in the human domain.

King Gu Tong had also made it to the Eight-star level these past couple of years. He was not as strong as the Abysmal King, but certainly not too far behind.

Along with so many Seven-star Ancient Gods within the Gu Clan, their power was astonishing, those experts in Gu Wang City could not have possibly taken down the city by themselves.

“Those people? Of course they couldn’t do it alone. They had help, we brothers weren’t enough to handle them,”?King Gu Tong said.

“So I see,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I’ll tell you the details back at Luo Wang City, Sword Emperor. King Luo Yu is waiting for you,” The Abysmal King replied.

“Let’s go then. Mind if y’all lead the way?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Under the brothers’ lead, they headed towards Luo Wang City.

Along the way, the trio started to chit chat.

“Wushuang, the last time I saw you was back at your hometown Green Fire World. When you still hadn’t made your breakthrough, you were already considered the top Peak Universe God amongst human Cultivators. Now that the breakthrough has been made, you are certainly much stronger right?” King Gu Tong looked over.

“Er, slightly, I guess,” Jian Wushuang replied humbly.

“Could you fight a Nine-star Ancient God?” King Gu Tong continued his questions.

“Should be able to,” Wushuang smiled.

“Really?” King Gu Tong had his reservations.

Jian Wushuang smiled, but did not explain much.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang halted.

“What’s wrong?”

King Gu You and Gu Tong paused as well, looking towards Jian Wushuang.

“Someone is here. They’re strong, and they don’t lack in numbers,” Jian Wushuang said.

King Gu You and Gu Tong’s faces turned dark.

Soon after, several figures could be seen in their line of sight. Ten people had formed a row, each with such powerful auras, the weakest among them was a top Seven-star Ancient God. Four Eight-star Ancient Gods were amongst the men, but the most eye-catching was the stocky, tanned, gorilla-like man.

The stars between that man’s eyebrows... he had nine!
