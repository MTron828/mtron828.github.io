Chapter 5418 ¬†Underwater Beast

This is the deep expanse of the Black Demon Sea, even deeper than their last visit.

"Down there!" Elder Qing Mang glanced at the jade slip.

The jade slip provided guidance based on their location.

Initially, the jade slip only contained one message, a call to gather on Qing Mang Island for Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang.

When everyone arrived, a second message appeared, indicating a location.

Black Demon Sea.

Upon reaching the Black Demon Sea, the second message was revealed.

Descend to the sea floor.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the dark clouds pressing overhead, took a deep breath, and dove straight into the water.

Splash!

Everyone began to submerge.

Jian Wushuang's body, like a sharp sword, pierced through the water for billions of miles without reaching the lowest point.

The pressure of the seawater here was enough to crush a Dao Lord.

A sheen of light appeared on Jian Wushuang's body, a devouring force that absorbed all the squeezing pressure, rendering it harmless to him.

The others, all at least peak-level tier 5, faced no issues.

However, even after traveling billions of miles, they had not reached the bottom, surprising Jian Wushuang.

This was too deep.

Continuing the descent, the resistance increased.

Initially, they encountered some sea monsters, but now, not a single one was in sight.

Sea monsters also possessed intelligence, and operating at such depths proved too uncomfortable for them.

Woo!

As Jian Wushuang continued to dive, he heard a melodious sound. When he looked down, a giant mouth, spanning millions of miles, was about to swallow everyone!

Rows of sharp teeth were terrifying to behold.

"Don't panic, it has already fallen!" Elder Zhi Shan took the lead and entered the giant sea monster's mouth.

Hum!

Elder Lan Yu clapped his hands, and a stream of light illuminated the entire seabed. The enormous sea monster revealed its form, resembling an ancient primordial beast.

The bloodline power was mediocre, but when alive, it was at least at the peak of the tier 6.

Having remained uncorroded for so many years, even the skeleton alone was worth a considerable amount of godstones.

Though tempted, Jian Wushuang wouldn't lower his status to take a skeleton. They were people with great ambitions.

Splash!

While he refrained, Bai Junwang was not polite. His figure transformed into millions of miles in size, directly pulling the primordial beast skeleton out of the seabed.

Although the others were somewhat surprised, they dared not say anything and even went up to help.

Jian Wushuang was in disbelief.

"Help, help me devour the debris above!" Bai Junwang waved his hand, signaling.

Hiss!

He knew Bai Junwang's idea‚Äîwanting to take this skeleton to enhance his physical body and further elevate his divine body, pushing his strength higher.

Bai Junwang's current combat power was comparable to the pinnacle of the tier 6, but it wasn't enough.

Any improvement would be welcome.

After merging with the primordial beast, Bai Junwang felt that his physical body still lacked something. He cleared his throat and said, "Do you have treasures on you? Items that can enhance the divine body!"

"Enough!" Jian Wushuang, with a dark face, walked toward Bai Junwang, placed a hand on his shoulder, and then transferred a massive amount of the Power of All Things.

Then he continued, "That's about it. Hurry up and open the relic; it's urgent!"

Once again, the group dived, reaching the seabed. Elder Qing Mang looked at the jade slip, and another message appeared above. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

"Travel north for a million miles, and you will find an underground mansion!"

Jian Wushuang nodded and said, "Let's go!"

Without any unnecessary words, he directly instructed Elder Qing Mang to lead the way.

Sure enough, not far away, there was a low and narrow cave, only about ten feet high.

The group transformed into ordinary human forms and slowly entered.

Leading the way were four Emperors in coats, each holding a precious dark lamp to illuminate the path ahead.

Jian Wushuang observed the surroundings and felt a creepy sensation.

It seemed like they weren't searching for relics but more like tomb raiders.

"It's here!" Elder Qing Mang pointed to a stone tablet ahead.

On it were some ancient inscriptions.

Jian Wushuang didn't recognize any of these characters; they were not from the Ancient Era or even the language of the human race.

"Bai Junwang, take a look!" Jian Wushuang stepped aside, allowing Bai Junwang to approach.

Regardless, Bai Junwang had lived for several eras.

During the time of Qishen, Bai Junwang was already an Emperor.

He must have more knowledge.

Approaching Bai Junwang, Jian Wushuang took out a set of worn-out clothes from his spatial item and gently wiped away the green marks on the stone.

"Fo!"

After a while, Bai Junwang finally deciphered the first inscription.

The stone tablet had tens of thousands of inscriptions, translating all of them would take years.

"Understand these first!" Jian Wushuang pointed to the top inscriptions on the stone tablet.

Bai Junwang continued his study.

After a while, he finally squeezed out a few characters.

"Fuego!" Bai Junwang continued, "At the top, it should be recording the oath of a powerful being named Fuego, who set out for a campaign!"

Although Jian Wushuang and the others found it somewhat confusing, at least they now knew the individual's name and purpose‚Äîbetter than being completely in the dark.

The group first attempted to see if they could collect the tombstone. When they realized it was futile, they gave up.

"Wake her up, let's go inside first!" Jian Wushuang threw Gong Miaoyi in front of the tombstone.

His avatar had stopped devouring. Gong Miaoyi should have awakened by now, but she didn't seem to be pretending. It was most likely that she couldn't resist.

Hum...

Elder Zi Shan took out a soul lamp, lifted it above Gong Miaoyi's head, and began to silently chant an incantation.

The sound was not blocked, nearly causing Jian Wushuang to pass out. Fortunately, his Thought mental power endured it.

Soon, Gong Miaoyi's tightly furrowed brows relaxed, and she slowly opened her eyes.

"What is this?"

Jian Wushuang sighed, "You're finally awake!"

However, Gong Miaoyi seemed to have lost some memories. She couldn't recognize Jian Wushuang and the others but showed great trust in Elder Zi Shan. She stood up and bowed slightly.

"Master!"

Jian Wushuang was taken aback but then understood. Gong Miaoyi had been completely controlled.

Just as he relaxed, a faint Thought power tore through the void and reached the distant Redwood Sea region.

That mental power eventually fell into the hands of the Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom, Luo Chuan.

"Black Demon Undersea, coordinates..." Luo Chuan, upon receiving the message, was overjoyed and hurriedly went to the main hall where the Lord of Turtle Spirit Island was located.

But when he saw his elder brother, Luo Sha, and noticed his changed expression, he felt uneasy.

Besides Luo Sha, several brothers, all of them tier 5 Emperors, were present. Tier 4 Emperors didn't have the qualifications to participate this time; the threshold had been raised to tier 5 Emperors.

Luo Chuan's special status and being the first to discover led to his presence here.

Once again, he made significant contributions.

At the same time, Zhen Wuyang and others anxiously waited in the main hall.

They initially held high expectations for the business, but eventually, Tongtian Buddha subtly manipulated the situation. He had led Zhen Wuyang to seek the help of Zhen Ling.
