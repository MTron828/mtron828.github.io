2016 Unkillable!

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

The six Great Emperors let their power be in full play, especially the beast-like bald man who was the most powerful of all. His soaring rage was heightened to its extreme limit. He was only holding his battle-ax but had yet to wield it. However, it had already concentrated into a terrifying extermination aura.

The six of them launched attacks all together.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t angry at the sight. He felt delighted.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qiao, the three of you should seize this chance. I will hold the six Great Emperors back so that they won’t interrupt you,” Jian Wushuang immediately sent them a message. Now, there was madness in his eyes.

Behind Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and the other two Great Emperors were dumbfounded at the sight.

They originally thought Jian Wushuang had intended to use the Secret Skill of Star Palace but…

“Hurry up, hurry up, Zhi Luo. Set up the spacetime tunnel,” Abysmal Saint Master came back to reality first and pressed them.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo instantly woke up and immediately started to set up the spacetime tunnel at the fastest speed possible while Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao assisted her.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang was hemmed in by six Great Emperors.

Fighting against the six Great Emperors, especially the beast-like bald man’s mad attack, although Jian Wushuang’s Mixed Element Spirit was magical, Jian Wushuang had just mastered it not too long ago after all. It was impossible if he wanted to fully defend himself and it was inevitable that he would be hit.

At the same time, there were attacks that contained boundless power that were constantly hitting.

Jian Wushuang looked savage and there was only madness in his eyes.

“Ten breaths time. I only need to resist for ten breaths time!”

“Come on, come on!!!”

Jian Wushuang roared and his power exploded at that very moment. He was instantly in a pitched battle against six Great Emperors.

The battle was total madness.

Fighting against six alone and all of them were Great Emperors. Jian Wushuang obviously couldn’t win against them. In the others’ views, he was courting death. He would definitely die.

But in the end… One breath, two breaths, five breaths of time passed.

In the five breaths’ time, Jian Wushuang and the surrounding six Great Emperors had exchanged a few hundred blows. There were more than a dozen attacks that hit Jian Wushuang directly and every single attack made his divine body quiver. However, he was fully recovered in the very next moment.

After five breaths’ time, his aura was still soaring and his battle intention grew more intense.

“Die!!!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed. He knew for a fact that he wasn’t their match but his eighteen arms continued to wield the swords. He tried his best to block all the attacks.

The surrounding Great Emperors turned pale with astonishment after five breaths’ time.

“How is this possible?”

“How could his divine body be that strong?”

“The six of us already hit his divine body more than a dozen times. Even Mister Ling Zong’s battle axe hit him twice. But in the end, he was perfectly fine?!”

The six Great Emperors exclaimed in disbelief.

The divine body that Jian Wushuang put on display exceeded their imaginations.

They had never expected that one in early stage chaotic realm could be perfectly fine after being hemmed in by the six Peak Chaotic Realm fighters!!!

“Is he immortal?” The purple-haired man with purple eyes who drove the six Hong Jun Golden Sword asked in terror.

No matter how shocking it was, Jian Wushuang did survive five breaths’ time under the besiegement and his fighting power didn’t diminish at all. He was still fighting ferociously against them.

The time flew past and In the blink of an eye, three breaths of time had passed.

By then, eight breaths of time had passed.

If it was any other Great Emperor that had gone through the eight breaths of time, he would definitely be beyond dead under such a besiegement. However, Jian Wushuang… was perfectly fine!

His divine body wasn’t damaged at all!

His aura was still at its peak!

His fighting power was more powerful and the battle intention had become even stronger!

“Monster!”

The six Great Emperors said the same term together.

Just then…

“Sword Emperor, the spacetime tunnel is already set up. Let’s leave!” Great Emperor Zhi Luo who was in the rear void sent Jian Wushuang a message. There was a tinge of terror in her voice. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It’s finally done!?” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy. Then, he smirked coldly and said, “I don’t want to play with you anymore!”

Just then, Jian Wushuang, who was hemmed in by the six Great Emperors, instantly shrunk his hundred zhang tall body and became an ordinary human cultivator. Simultaneously, he wanted to retreat.

“Want to leave?”

The surrounding Great Emperors were furious. How could they just let Jian Wushuang off the hook so easily?

Just as Jian Wushuang retreated to the back, he was wearing a bantering smirk. Then, he slammed his hand down to the front.

“Nine-province of the universe, Yan Province as the seal, was called “Turn up the Cloud!!!”

Rumble. Heaven and earth quivered. There was a terrifying power that swept over like a storm.

The six Great Emperors who were chasing after Jian Wushuang looked up into the sky subconsciously.

They realized that there was a huge yet magnificent world of mountains and rivers appeared in the sky above.

The world of mountains and rivers gave off a mysterious yet ancient aura. Then, one of the lofty continents in the world started descending.

The continent was too huge and it contained a terrifyingly strong power.

On the nine-province Seal in River Mountain Map, one was stronger than the other seal.

Jian Wushuang was performing the fourth seal that could only be performed after he entered the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, Turn Up the Cloud!

The Seal, Turn Up the Cloud, was extremely powerful.

The six Great Emperors saw the descending lofty continent and they got a shock.

“When did he set this up?”

“It must have been when the six of us were attacking him. I reckon he set this up when we were not paying attention!”

“B*stard. The six of us were focusing on how to kill him. We couldn’t care less about the others but he set this up in silence!”

The six Great Emperors were astonished.

But it was the truth. When Jian Wushuang was hemmed in, he looked as though he was mad, didn’t care about anything, and would stop at nothing.

But in actual fact, he was extremely calm. As for River Mountain Map, he threw it out silently with the cover-up of his huge body. Hence, the six Great Emperors hadn’t noticed at all.

By the time they noticed, Jian Wushuang had already saved up enough divine power in the world of mountains and rivers to perform the fourth seal.

It was also the route of retreat that Jian Wushuang had prepared for himself.

The fourth seal, Turn up the Cloud! The seal was known to be the strongest attack that Jian Wushuang had on hand. The six Great Emperors in front of him couldn’t belittle the power of the attack either.
