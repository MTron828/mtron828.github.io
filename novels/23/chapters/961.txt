“Are you saying that you want to quickly restore your body? You’d better give up that idea,” said Gu King.

“Look at yourself, you can’t restore your body within a short period of time. That said, I have to admit that you’re lucky. After you killed that Dao Yuanzi, I managed to get his Interspatial Ring. This guy from the Blood Killing Sect stored many treasures in the ring, and some of them can help you restore your body and strength.

“However, even with the help of these treasures, it’ll still take you at least 1,000 years to restore your body.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“A thousand years?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in astonishment while groaning inwardly.

“Are you kidding? It has been at most five hundred years since I was born.

“Now I need to spend a thousand years restoring my body and strength. And this is the best result that can be achieved using the treasures left by Dao Yuanzi.”

“It’s only a thousand years. It’s really quick. It’ll pass in a blink of an eye,”?said Gu King.

Jian Wushuang felt helpless.

After a moment, he asked, “Gu King, do you know where did that Dao Yuanzi come from? And what was the Blood Killing Sect? Those guys didn’t belong to this place, right?”

He was curious about them.

“You’re right. Dao Yuanzi did come from another place.” Gu King nodded slightly. “Jian Wushuang, as you know, there’re always skies beyond our skies and people better and stronger than us. Our Realm is big enough for us, but that doesn’t mean that it’s the only Realm in the world.”

“I know this.” Jian Wushuang admitted.

He had come to understand this fact back in the Star Island when he had first known the existence of Star Bloodline.

Back then, he had noticed that the founder of the Star Bloodline seemed to possess powers that did not belong to this Realm.

Apart from the founder of the Star Bloodline, King Luo Zhen, a Eight-star Imperial God also seemed to have such powers.

“The world we’re in is vast and far beyond your imagination.

“And it’s known by the name Eternal Chaotic World.”

Gu King explained. “Eternal Chaotic World consists of many Realms, which were also known as Eternal Worlds, thus our Eternal World is only part of the Eternal Chaotic World. Every Eternal World has its own name. As far as I know, your Eternal World is known by the name Green Fire World.”

“Green Fire World?”?Jian Wushuang wondered in amazement; he had never heard of this name before.

“In the past, warriors in the Green Fire World usually referred to this world as the Eternal World.

“Nevertheless, the Green Fire World is actually just one of the many Eternal Worlds.

“Does this principle also apply to the Ancient World?”

“After all, the Ancient World also consists of many equal Realms,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“There are countless experts in this vast Eternal Chaotic World, and some of them possess powers that are way beyond our imagination. For example, a Dao Master could be considered as the top dog in his or her Eternal World, but compared to the top-notch experts of the Eternal Chaotic World, a Dao Master is nothing.

“All the first-rate experts of the Eternal Chaotic World possess mighty powers, such as the founder of the Star Bloodline and my former master, King Luo Zhen.

“The former could create a vast Stellar Fog Sea with just a movement of his hand, and the latter was a Eight-star Imperial God.

“As for the Seven-star Imperial God King Gu Tong that you saw in the previous battle, he can never compete with King Luo Zhen in power,” Gu King added.

“Both Gu Tong and King Luo Zhen are Imperial Gods, and the former is just one level below the latter. Why is there such a huge difference between them?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“One level makes a lot of difference,” Gu King said sneeringly, “You’re still too weak to understand that now. When your levels get significantly improved, you’ll be able to explore the other Realms. At that time, you’ll understand.

“There is only one star’s difference between the Seven-star Imperial God and the Eight-star Imperial God, but that one star makes a huge difference.”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel astonished.

“Compared to the first-rate experts of the Eternal Chaotic World, Dao Yuanzi was just a nobody. However, the Blood Killing Sect he belonged to is widely known. It’s the evilest sect in the world. Even the founder of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen could not afford to mess with them,” said Gu King.

“Wow. I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You’re still weak and don’t need this kind of knowledge at this moment. I will tell you all the things that you should know, when you become a Dao Master and are able to freely explore the Eternal Chaotic World. At present, the most important thing is to restore your body and become a Dao Master,” said Gu King.

“Yes, you’re right.” Jian Wushuang agreed.

“Take your time, restore your body first,” said Gu King. “You’ve forced yourself to absorb the Essence Blood left by King Luo Zhen and wasted 90% of its power. But, you managed to refine a small volume of it and integrate it into your body. When you recover, your strength should be improved.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

During the previous battle, he had compelled himself to absorb the Essence Blood and wasted a good part of it. However, a small volume of it was still left in the drop of blood that he had left in this world. This Essence Blood would probably do him some good in the future.

“In addition, among the many treasures left by Dao Yuanzi, some of them are pretty useful to you. You can try them out after you’ve recovered,” said Gu King.

“Treasures left by Dao Yuanzi?” Jian Wushuang felt thrilled.

“As an expert of the Eternal Chaotic World and a disciple of the Blood Killing Sect, Dao Yuanzi must have many priceless treasures.

“His Blood-killing Plate Armor is really amazing.

“During the previous battle, when King Gu Tong first arrived at the battlefield, he could severely injure Dao Yuanzi with just a punch. His battle strength is clearly much stronger than that of Dao Yuanzi.

“However, the next moment when Dao Yuanzi put on his Blood-killing Plate Armor, his strength increased so much that he managed to resist King Gu Tong in the end.

“Obviouly, it was his Blood-killing Plate Armor that had drastically improved his powers,” thought Jian Wushuang.

“Look at you! What a naive boy. The treasures left by Dao Yuanzi are good, and some of them are useful to you. However, all his treasures combined cannot compete with your Mountain River Map!” said Gu King.

“Mountain River Map?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and then thought of this treasure.

It was this Mountain River Map that had enabled him to destroy his enemies during the previous battle. Back on that battlefield, he had managed to activate the map and use a Nine-province Seal skill to crush Dao Yuanzi and his Life Devouring Formation during the last minutes of the battle.
