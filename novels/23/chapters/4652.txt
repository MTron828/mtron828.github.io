4653 Furnace

Since Jian Wushuang had disappeared for nearly 300 years, the clansmen sent by countless clans had almost all rushed to the territory of the Qilin clan. Now, they were at the center of the entire Divine Power Universe — the Cangwu Platform!

It was still tens of millions of miles away, but all the cultivators who came could feel a vast and supreme divine power.

Everyone’s face was filled with excitement. The Great Dao they felt was the aura of an Ancestor realm!

Over a million cultivators had already arrived in front of the Cangwu Platform from all directions of the Divine Power Universe.

The towering Hall seemed to be built entirely from spiritual Jade, and the vast divine power it emitted nourished every cultivator who came here.

The group of ten came from the Taicang Shrine and stopped in front of the Cangwu Platform. They were all at the Ultimate Ruler realm.

The Taicang Shrine had sent out all five Supreme-being elders to participate in the battle. Four of them had died on the battlefield, leaving only one Top Supreme realm cultivator who had returned with serious injuries.

“Eldest Senior Brother, do you think we’ll be in trouble when we return? We came here to listen to the teachings behind the Second Elder’s back.” One of the cultivators, who was short and fat, said nervously, “Before he went into seclusion, Second Elder even swore that he would break the legs of anyone who dared to come to the sect…”

The leader of the cultivators frowned. “Idiot, if you don’t tell, and if I don’t tell, how would Second Elder know? Besides, we only listened to the Grand Elder’s words and came here to listen to the Dao and sit in Enlightenment. If Second Elder wants to break a leg, it should be the Grand Elder’s leg.”

The only female disciple in this group of ten-plus people looked around her, then whispered, “Eldest Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, have you noticed that all the cultivators here are the Ultimate Rulers? I don’t even see any Supremes.”

The Eldest Senior Brother coughed heavily, then said in a low voice, “Isn’t that even better? Later on, when Cosmos God opens the Cangwu Platform, we’ll try our best to snatch the futons that are closest to the front!”

When he said this, they became excited. Listening to the Dao under the command of Cosmos God was equivalent to giving each of them an entrance ticket to break through to the Supreme relm!

The female disciple was the only one who scratched her head in confusion. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the center of the shattered Rodu Star Field, three figures stood in front of the Spring of Chaos that Old Master had sealed with a wave of his hand.

Lu Ding, who was still dressed in a white Confucian robe, stood at the forefront, and behind him stood Lu Ting and Lu Gong.

Lu Ding, who was as imposing as before, was surrounded by a terrifying Ancestor realm aura.

He frowned and looked at the Spring of Chaos that had been sealed by the Black Water without saying a word.

After an unknown period of time, he asked in a deep voice, “How many cultivators have arrived from the outside world?”

Hearing this, Lu Ting and Lu Gong looked at each other, then stepped forward and said, “Big Brother, there are nearly three million cultivators who have arrived at the Cangwu Platform. They are all at the Ultimate Ruler realm. As for the Supreme realm experts, they are… There are less than tens of thousands.”

“Bastard! A bunch of damned things!” Lu Ding roared in anger, and a dark aura that did not match his previous temperament surged from his eyes.

“I have so humbly begged them to come, but they actually don’t know how to appreciate favors.” Suppressing his anger and hatred, Lu Ding’s eyes grew darker.

Turning around, the darkness in his eyes had completely disappeared and was replaced by magnanimity and kindness.

When Lu Ting and Lu Gong heard this, they immediately said, “Big Brother, if you have anything to say, just tell us directly. The three of us brothers will not distinguish between each other.”

Lu Ding nodded heavily and said, “In that case, I’ll have to ask all of you to come out this time. Please invite the Divine Life Palace, the Dragon and Phoenix clans, and all the Supremes and Half Ancestors to the Cangwu Platform. I want to make it up to them. After all, I was in the wrong this time.”

“Don’t worry, Big Brother. No matter what, the two of us will definitely invite them over to show the sincerity of our Qilin clan,” Lu Ting said firmly, “There’s no time to lose. We will definitely invite them over before you start preaching the Dao for people to gain Enlightenment.”

After that, the two of them left.

Looking at the disappearing figure, a dark expression appeared in Lu Ding’s eyes again, which was extremely inconsistent with his Ancestor realm identity.

The entire shattered Rodu Star Field was still in its original state. Looking at the Spring of Chaos beneath his feet, Lu Ding turned his gaze to his left arm.

The next moment, he suddenly raised his right hand, and with his fingers like a knife, he directly cut off his entire left arm from his shoulder blade!

“Ah…” With a muffled groan of pain, Lu Ding’s right hand caught a complete arm.

Supreme divine blood gushed out from the broken part, but Lu Ding did not care at all. He let the divine blood stain his clothes, looking like a terrifying demonic god.

Looking at the arm that was still trembling in his hand, Lu Ding’s eyes were filled with hatred.

“Damn you, Jian Wushuang. You were the perfect host that I was going to latch on to, but you disappeared without a trace. That’s why I went through so much trouble!”

“If you appear in front of me again, I’ll definitely cut you into pieces!”

The divine blood gradually dissipated, and at the same time, his broken left arm grew back. Lu Ding was as calm and composed as before, and he looked majestic.

The severed arm had also changed its appearance at some point in time. It had turned into a flesh-colored small cauldron with intricate patterns carved on it.

I can’t wait any longer. I’ll let you all contribute some nutrients to my clay idol first.

Lu Ding smiled gloomily. He suddenly opened his arms as if he was hugging someone, and leaped into the void.

The vast Cangwu Platform, which had already been constructed into a towering hall, slowly opened its huge door at this moment.

An extremely pure divine power gushed out and all the cultivators who rushed to the Cangwu Platform were bathed in this divine power.

All the cultivators could feel that the shackles on them had loosened.

Roar!

A roar that reverberated through the ages resounded as a Qilin surging with pure yang energy descended!

On the Cangwu Platform, the solemn and majestic giant image of the Ancestral Qilin form appeared.

“To all the people of the Divine Power Universe, I have inherited the Heavenly Dao. In order to save the Divine Power Universe from the disasters and to be qualified for the position of Cosmos God, I have opened a Dao Plaza today and opened the Dao listening praying mats to bestow upon you a great opportunity.”

As Lu Ding’s majestic voice fell, the door of the Cangwu Platform’s giant hall was completely opened.

“Everyone, please take your seats.”

All the cultivators were in a frenzy. They swarmed forward without a care for anything in order to snatch the futon closest to Cosmos God.

The ten people from the Taicang Shrine were at the back of the crowd. Each of them had an anxious look on their faces, afraid that they would not be able to get a futon.

Only the female disciple who was protected by her Senior Brothers was a little confused.

She did not not know if it was an illusion or if her mind was in a trance, but she accidentally saw Cosmos God sitting on top of the Cangwu Platform’s giant hall. There was a hint of strangeness in the vast and sacred aura.
