4144 Interception

After Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three left, only Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and divine Marquis Qingfeng were left in the towering hall.

Ninth Kalpa King narrowed his eyes slightly and first glanced at Divine Marquis Qingfeng.

Divine Marquis Qingfeng was gentle and had some conflicts with Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, so Ninth Kalpa King was not surprised that he chose to stay.

However, Jian Wushuang chose to stay, which surprised Ninth Kalpa King.

“Jian Wushuang, why didn’t you leave with Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll take your middle-grade principle divine fruit if you stay here? After all, no one in this team can stop me from doing anything.” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang, he said with a fake smile.

“Oh? Then you can try.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and a cold light flashed in them.

Now that he had broken through to the fourth-level Ruler realm, his strength had greatly increased, and he had the superior-grade principle armor given to him by Ruler Blood Wave. Although he was still no match for Ninth Kalpa King, if he wanted to leave…he was afraid that Ninth Kalpa King would not be able to stay.

Moreover, he knew very well that no matter how much Ninth Kalpa King disliked him, he would never dare to attack him.

After all, they were all members of the Life Palace. Once Ninth Kalpa King attacked him, he only needed to directly send a message to Ruler Blood Wave. The consequences Ninth Kalpa King would face were not something he could bear.

“Forget it. Since I lost to you in the trial field, I won’t think about the middle-grade principle fruit anymore,” Ninth Kalpa King said with a wave of his hand.

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

In fact, the reason why he did not leave with Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others was not only because he did not want to kill other teams of Rulers and steal treasures for no reason, but also because of an extremely important reason, that was the character of Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

Although Jian Wushuang and the other two had not been in the same team for a long time, he could more or less see some of their personalities.

Apart from being arrogant and a little arrogant, the Ninth Kalpa King could not be disliked in other aspects.

However, it was different for Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves. Jian Wushuang had seen many of her small actions and thoughts in the team over the years. He could tell that she was very selfish and hypocritical, moreover, her arrogance was no less than that of the Ninth Kalpa King.

In comparison, Jian Wushuang would rather stay with the Ninth Kalpa King.

“Alright, both of you. Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others have left. There are only three of US left in our team, and our strength has been greatly reduced. You should work together to explore the Tarot Ruins,” Marquis Qingfeng said with a smile.

Like Jian Wushuang, Marquis Qingfeng knew Emperor Qianye’s character. He did not leave with them just now.

“Humph, it’s just that four trash are missing.” Ninth Kalpa King snorted, disagreeing with him.

Jian Wushuang and Marquis Qingfeng looked at each other and smiled helplessly.

Then, the three-man team continued to explore the Tarot Ruins, while at the same time, they kept asking about Zhufeng King’s team.

And on the other side…

In the vast void, two Ruler teams met.

One of the two Ruler teams was a four-man team led by Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye. As for the other team, there were a total of six people. They were also Ultimate Rulers. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

There was clearly a large gap in the number of people on both sides. However, when the six-man team saw Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three, their expressions turned extremely gloomy.

The six-man team came from the demonic rain divine kingdom and was led by a Pinnacle Ultimate Ruler, Eighth Cloud Demon Lord.

“Life Palace’s Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, Ruler Violet Eye, nine Yang Ruler, and Qinan Ruler.” Eighth Cloud Demon Lord frowned. “Four of you, why are you blocking our way?”

“Eighth Cloud Ruler, if I remember correctly, your team arrived at the Tarot Ruins more than ten thousand years ago, right?” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves wore a strange smile, he looked at Eighth Cloud Demon Lord and Company.

“So what if it is?” Eighth Cloud Demon Lord said in a deep voice.

“Nothing. I just want to know what you have obtained in the Tarot Ruin over the past 10,000 years,” asked Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

“Hmph, there are so many Rulers who have ventured into the Tarot Ruin. Our team is not very strong. Even if we encounter an opportunity, we will not be able to snatch it. After more than 10,000 years, our team has obtained nothing,” said Eighth Cloud Demon Lord.

“Nothing?” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves shook his head. “I don’t believe it. How about this? The six of you take out your interspatial rings and let us inspect them. If you really do not obtain any decent treasures, I’ll let you leave. How about it?”

“Bastard!” Eighth Cloud Fiend Ruler was instantly enraged.

The other four Ultimate Rulers of the demonic rain divine kingdom also glared angrily.

He wanted them to take out their interspatial rings and let him investigate them?

How was that possible?

“Haha, since you are unwilling to hand over your interspatial rings, then you can not blame us. The three of you, kill!” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’s loud laughter spread out.

With that said, a heaven-shaking aura instantly surged out of Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’ body. His Divine Body suddenly expanded as he charged out.

The Ruler Violet Eye, Nine Yang Ruler, and Qinan, who stood beside him, gave a sinister laugh as they charged forward.

The battle instantly erupted.

And the intense battle did not last long. It ended in just a few moments.

Although Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’s team only had dead people, the demonic rain divine kingdom had a total of six Ultimate Rulers. However, four of the six Ultimate Rulers were only close to the pinnacle level. As for the other two, even the strongest Eighth Cloud Demon Lord…they were only at the Pinnacle Ultimate Ruler level. They were only on par with nine Yang Ruler and Qinan Ruler. They were much weaker than Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye.

With such a lineup, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves alone was enough to kill them all. Furthermore, the four of them had attacked at the same time.

In just a few moments, four of the six Ultimate Rulers of the demonic rain divine kingdom were killed on the spot. One of them was a Pinnacle Ultimate Ruler. The remaining Eighth Cloud Demon Lord and an Ultimate Ruler managed to escape by a fluke.

After the battle, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Company gathered together to share the spoils of war.

“Haha, I knew it. The team from the demonic rain divine kingdom has roamed the Tarot Ruins for more than ten thousand years. It’s impossible that they did not gain anything. Look, we only killed four of them and even let the strongest Eighth cloud fiend Ruler escape. But our gains are still extremely huge.” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves’ eyes were filled with pleasant surprise.

The other three, too, were delighted.
