Chapter 1852: Visit

The Master of Star Palace had just passed away and it was a fact.

The fact would be found out eventually. Jian Wushuang and the others were mentally prepared.

There was someone who had made a speculation that the Master of Star Palace had died based on the inability to get in contact with the Master of Star Palace and the abnormal behavior of Lineage of Star. Although it was beyond Jian Wushuang’s expectations, there was no choice, they had to act like that.

After all, Ancient Mystery Land only opened once every five million years and it only opens for ten thousand years each time.

The moment the limit of ten thousand years was reached, the Master of Star Palace wouldn’t exit Ancient Mystery Land, it meant that he had definitely passed away.

By then it had been eight thousand years. It was merely a thousand years earlier than expected.

However, they seized the chance to kill a large number of solo experts who harbored grudges against Lineage of Star.

“Hall Master Yuan, how did the recruitment of experts using Chaos Divine Treasure and other resources go?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It is going well. Until now, Lineage of Star has got in contact with over thirty solo experts. Among the over thirty solo experts, more than one third of them are quite convinced by the condition we offered. Among the solo experts, there were two Emperor Gods. But according to Palace Master’s instruction, I have yet to let them give me their answers,” Hall Master Yuan reported.

“Mm, it’s right to not them answer yet. The news about the Master of Star Palace’s death has spread but it is mere speculation after all. No one is definite that the Master of Star Palace is dead. Before they confirm that, there shouldn’t be anyone who has the guts to take action against Lineage of Star. Even if they do come, Lineage of Star shall deal with them. During this time, let the people consider clearly if they want to join Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Then…” Jian Wushuang tapped on the armrest and replied after he thought for a while, “The news has spread and the forces in Sanctuary Alliance are definitely in a hubbub. Every one of them is keeping watch of Lineage of Star. They intend to determine what’s true or false through our response. The closer we approach the crucial moment, the calmer we should carry ourselves. Even when people send us messages to ask the Master of Star Palace’s whereabouts, tell them that the Master of Star Palace is in a unique place in Ancient Mystery Land and there is a hindrance in Spacetime so we couldn’t contact him.”

“If there is anyone who is trying to be funny with us… counter soldiers with arms, water with an earth weir. Regardless of the situation that we are going to face, we of Lineage of Star shall adopt the appropriate measures.”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s reply, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun nodded heavily.

Lineage of Star then was different from before. Even if the Master of Star Palace passed away, Lineage of Star still wouldn’t be one that anyone could provoke.

“Alright, you are dismissed. As usual, do what you usually do,” Jian Wushuang. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yes,” the three Hall Masters nodded.

The entire Sanctuary Alliance and the entire Eternal Chaotic World were talking about the news where the Master of Star Palace had passed away but Lineage of Star, who had obviously become a public enemy, wasn’t shaken at all.

All forces kept watch of Lineage of Star but realized that Lineage of Star wasn’t any different.

Those who should cultivate, continued to cultivate. Those who should wander, continued to wander. Those who should go for an adventure, continued to go for an adventure.

It was as though they had never heard of the news.

The equanimity made the forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance even more confused. They didn’t understand if Lineage of Star pretended to be calm or if the Master of Star Palace wasn’t dead at all so they were confident.

Those people who were itching to launch an attack settled down in order to not make a rash advance.

Such a situation was only maintained for a month’s time.

One month later, outside Universe Galaxy where Lineage of Star was.

A shabbily-dressed elderly with messy, fiery-red hair and a dirty body, like a beggar’s, appeared.

The slovenly elderly looked at the resplendent galaxy in front of him and there was a flash of strange light in his eyes. He then said,

“Zhu Long, you specially came here to visit everyone in Lineage of Star.”

His bright and loud voice spread across Universe Galaxy, also traveled into Lineage of Star’s lair.

The experts in Lineage of Star and the disciples heard the voice but they weren’t surprised.

As one of the top forces in Eternal Chaotic World, Lineage of Star, who had befriended some experts, would have some visitors in Lineage of Star occasionally. It was very normal.

However, the few higher-ups in Lineage of Star heard the voice and their faces changed.

“Zhu Long? It must be Emperor God Zhu Long!”

Hall Master Yuan’s gaze grew solemn, “Emperor God Zhu Long has nothing to do with Lineage of Star and he isn’t a friend of ours either. We go our own way without interfering with each other. He isn’t among the experts that I tried to get in contact all these years either. What did he come here personally for?”

“Who knows?” Hall Master Nie Yun asked coldly.

Swoosh!

There was an illusionary figure and Jian Wushuang appeared next to Hall Master Yuan.

“Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Emperor God Zhu Long, although he isn’t a Peak Emperor God, he isn’t too low-ranked on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list either. He visits personally and we of Lineage of Star can’t leave him outside. How about this: Hall Master Yuan, you and Hall Master Gu Xin welcome him in. I will watch in silence. With me here, he shouldn’t be able to stir up any trouble,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

Then, Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin immediately greeted him personally.

At the border of Universe Galaxy.

“Haha, Emperor God Zhu Long came personally. We of Lineage of Star are greatly honored to have you as our guest,” Hall Master Yuan had just got there and his laughter spread.

The slovenly elderly, Emperor God Zhu Long, looked at the two of them.

“You must be Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin from Lineage of Star,” Emperor God Zhu Long looked calm and composed. However, he thought to himself: “I, an Emperor God, came to visit personally but Lineage of Star only sent two Sir Gods to welcome me. Jian Wushuang didn’t even come out? He thinks so highly of himself.”

Of course, he didn’t display any displeasure on the surface.

“Emperor God Zhu Long, welcome.”

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin brought Emperor God Zhu Long into Milky Way. Very soon, they arrived in Lineage of Star’s lair.

On a star where they received visitors, the three Hall Masters of Lineage of Star were there. Emperor God Long Zhu sat in front of a long, narrow table and there were maidservants serving him. As for Jian Wushuang, he never revealed himself.

“Emperor God Zhu Long, I wonder what’s the purpose of your visit in Lineage of Star?” Hall Master sat on the highest throne as he asked.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun looked at Emperor God Zhu Long.
