“Space-time, this is the real space-time!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with a trace of joy.

Now, he was clear about the space-time principles and no longer had any doubts. At this moment, he could grasp all the power of the space-time principles that existed between heaven and earth.

This kind of complete mastery was completely different from before when he had only comprehended part of it.

For example, no matter how high his comprehension of the space-time principles was, the power of the space-time principles that he could use could only be a part of heaven and earth, at most between 40% to 50%.

But after completely grasping the space-time principles, the space-time principles that he could use suddenly reached 100%, which was undoubtedly a huge change.

“However, although I have completely mastered the space-time principles, it doesn’t mean that I have reached the limit in the space-time field. After all, I have also mastered the space-time principles, but if different people use it, the strength they will display will be different,” Jian Wushuang thought.

After completely mastering the space-time principles, the next step of the space-time Dao was to improve the method of using the space-time principles.

Do not underestimate this method of use. To many Principles Masters, the use of the power of principles was an important factor that represented their combat strength.

For example, in the Temporal Temple, many Principles Masters had already comprehended the principles of time and space, but their strength was still strong and weak. For someone as strong as the Temporal Temple Master, his use of the principles of time and space had already reached the peak, his strength looked down on the entire Divine Beginning Realm. Even the three high and mighty Saint Realm Masters were better than the enemy when facing the space-time Hall Master.

As for the weaker ones, like the ordinary Principles Masters, their use of the space-time principles was very shallow, so their combat strength was not much stronger.

Of course, for Principles Masters, the true decisive difference in strength was still the power of will.

Every Principles Master in the Divine Beginning Realm had at least one part of the power of will. This power of will could come from several aspects, but the most important part was the comprehension of the principles.

As long as he had fully comprehended the principles, the Principles Master could have one more part of the power of will. Now that Jian Wushuang had fully comprehended the power of the space-time principles, he had mastered the space-time principles, naturally, he had an additional will power of the space-time principles. This will power was a space-time mark that directly entered Jian Wushuang’s glabella and merged into his mind.

Jian Wushuang could also clearly sense the additional strange power in his mind.

He guided this strange power as he pleased.

“Will power, is this the complete will power?” Jian Wushuang exerted strength with both hands, and the strange power in his mind was instantly activated.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. He felt that the void in which he was standing was trembling crazily.

“It’s too strong, this will power is really too strong!” Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

He had swallowed divine power before, so he had temporarily obtained some of the power of the will. The power of the will contained in the divine power was only a small part of it.

Even so, it still made his strength soar.

But now, he had comprehended the complete principles and mastered a portion of the power of the will.

The power of his will was much stronger than before.

“No wonder the Immortal Saint can’t compete with the Principles Master in the Divine Beginning Realm. No Immortal Saint can make up for the power of his will alone. Even for me…although I have a perfect life level and an incredible innate advantage, I’m at the top of the Immortal Saint Realm. At most, I can match the Principles Master in the power of my divine power, but I can’t make up for the difference in the power of my will,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The power of will was granted by the principles of heaven and earth, so it was extraordinary.

“I have comprehended the space-time principles and gained a portion of the power of will with the help of the complete Heavenly Dao for more than ten days. During this time, my divine power has reached the peak of the Immortal Saint. I should be able to directly attack the Principles Master and make a breakthrough easily, but why do I feel like I can’t make a breakthrough at all?” Jian Wushuang suddenly frowned.

If it were an ordinary cultivator, he would have already met all the conditions for a breakthrough. If he chose to make a breakthrough, he would be able to become a Principles Master.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was not an ordinary cultivator.

“I can’t make a breakthrough. Even if I have met all the conditions for a breakthrough, I still can’t make a breakthrough. I don’t even need to try.” Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly, but he was not surprised.

He had already guessed it when he was talking to Xue Bo.

There were all kinds of special life forms in the world. Although they had a huge innate advantage, they were greatly suppressed by the restrictions of the world.

The reason why he could not make a breakthrough was because of the restrictions of the Heavenly Dao.

For other cultivators, they could make a breakthrough, but he could not.

He needed to be stronger and satisfy more difficult conditions than ordinary cultivators.

“It seems that it’s impossible for me to become a Principles Master in Blood Wave Temple with the help of the opportunities here.” Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly, but then he raised his head again.

“Although I can’t break through to become a Principles Master, the opportunity in front of me is really hard to come by. It’s still very helpful to me. I’ve only used 16 days to completely comprehend the space-time principles. In the next 14 days, I can completely focus on the reincarnation principles. If I can completely comprehend the reincarnation principles in the remaining time, then I can have an additional power of will. In that case, I won’t be any weaker than a real Principles Master.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and soon closed his eyes again. He began to study the Samsara principles wholeheartedly.

Of course, his comprehension of the Samsara principles was much lower than that of the space-time principles. Under such circumstances, it took him 16 days to completely understand the space-time principles. The remaining 14 days…it was obviously impossible for him to completely understand the Samsara principles, but it was enough to greatly improve the Samsara principles.

Time slowly passed, and in the blink of an eye, fourteen days had passed.

In the Blood Wave Temple, the one-month deadline had also arrived..
