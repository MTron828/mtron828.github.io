Chapter 2711: The First Elder

“You want me to join the Sword Alliance?” Strange Old Snake was surprised.

Jian Wushuang looked at Strange Old Snake expectantly.

Although Jian Wushuang’s strength had completely surpassed Strange Old Snake, he needed more high-level combat power if Sword Alliance were to continue its expansion. Jian Wushuang could not rely on himself alone, so he had to find ways to recruit more experts.

Strange Old Snake was very powerful even among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods and naturally fell within Jian Wushuang’s recruitment target.

Strange Old Snake pondered for a moment and smiled. “I agree to join the Sword Alliance.”

“Mmm?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised as he knew a little about Strange Old Snake.

Free-spirited lone rangers like Strange Old Snake would not easily join any forces.

There were many first-rated forces in Danyang Continent including some top forces that tried to win Strange Old Snake over, but he bluntly rejected the forces’ generous offers.

Jian Wushuang did not have high expectations for Strange Old Snake to accept his invitation and only thought of just trying it out.

Unexpectedly, Strange Old Snake agreed.

He agreed with alacrity before Jian Wushuang even offered him anything.

‘He made the decision quite hastily, didn’t he?’

“Alliance Master, I’ll never regret it since I’ve agreed to join Sword Alliance. I’ll accept the tasks you assign to me from now on,” said Strange Old Snake.

Jian Wushuang felt even weirder to hear his reassurance and said, “In that case, you will be the First Elder in Sword Alliance from today onwards, Strange Old Snake. Your position is second only to me and has the same level as Xin’er our Chief Steward. Sword Alliance will try our best to get it for you should you need any resources in the future,” explained Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you, Alliance Master.” Strange Old Snake nodded joyfully.

Strange Old Snake was indeed a lone ranger as Jian Wushuang said. He did not like to join any forces and preferred to be free.

However, his personality was not the main factor that determined his behavior but his extreme concern over the benefits he could gain.

Benefits were more important than anything!

He would join a force and perform any given tasks if the benefits offered were sufficiently attractive.

The forces that previously sent out invitations to him offered attractive benefits but those benefits did not appeal to him at all. In short, he was not impressed by their offers.

On the other hand, the Sword Alliance was different.

Jian Wushuang was different to be precise.

He saw Jian Wushuang’s huge potential and bright future.

“There’s no doubt that Jian Yi is a real demon—a Superior Demon. I’m afraid that even the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion which was known as a place where geniuses gathered in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow may not have such a super genius. At least I’ve never heard of one. Which Peak Heaven Ultimate God in Dragon Phoenix Pavilion could kill a Grand Ultimate God?” Strange Old Snake muttered to himself.

The gap between Heaven Ultimate God and Grand Ultimate God was too big.

The Peak Heaven Ultimate God demonic genius in Dragon Phoenix Pavilion could probably compete with an ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate God but that was about it. There was no chance of a Peak Heaven Ultimate God demonic genius to defeat a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

Strange Old Snake was surprised to see Jian Wushuang managed to mercilessly behead a top Primary-level Grand Ultimate God with his own eyes. Jian Wushuang’s ability to go beyond his cultivation realm was truly terrifying. It was the reason that convinced Strange Old Snake about Jian Wushuang’s great potential—a potential so great that it was terrifying.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was not only an exceptionally strong talent but also very smart when taking action.

In just two to three years, he managed to create such a large Sword Alliance to the point he could take over the Star Fort and become a first-rated force.

“I’ve always been very good at reading people. From what I see, Jian Yi is impeccable in terms of his talent, strength, and the way he carried out his actions. He also has a special relationship with Crimson Stone Fort. I’m sure he can do a lot of things in the Danyang continent within an extremely short time. He might even change the situation in the Danyang Continent!

“I can even see Crimson Stone Saint’s shadow in him...”

Strange Old Snake was extremely excited.

The founder of Crimson Stone Fort—Crimson Stone Saint was the former ruler of the Danyang Continent.

Many years ago, Crimson Stone Fort rose to the top in an extremely short period with its influence spread across the region and finally occupied a great deal of Danyang Holy Domain.

Crimson Stone Saint was so prestigious at that time. Strange Old Snake had regretted being too weak with talents that did not appeal to Crimson Stone Saint, so he could not get a place in Crimson Stone Fort.

Strange Old Snake could see Jian Wushuang would be the second Crimson Stone Saint. No, Jian Wushuang was even better than the Crimson Stone Saint.

Strange Old Snake did not think it was a disadvantage for him to be under such a super genius’s leadership. Instead, he thought it was a huge advantage because he was the first Grand Ultimate God to be Jian Wushuang’s follower. Jian Wushuang would then pay more attention to him, allowing him to reap greater benefits when Jian Wushuang rises rapidly in the future!

Therefore, he did not need Jian Wushuang to promise him anything and agreed with alacrity when Jian Wushuang invited him to join the Sword Alliance.

As for Jian Wushuang, he felt strange that Strange Old Snake agreed too easily, but did not think much about it.

After all, Strange Old Snake could no longer threaten him whether he had any thoughts of doing so.

Dragon City had completely quieted down along with those Star Fort experts.

Once everything had quieted down, Jian Wushuang then instructed Strange Old Snake to take the lead to set off with the Divine Sword Army and high-level Star Fort experts to lay claim over the Star Fort’s territories.

In the main hall of the black castle, Jian Wushuang was sitting there alone with an Interspatial Ring in his hand.

The Interspatial Ring had been left behind by the deceased Fo Yi.

Fo Yi was a genuine Grand Ultimate God expert and also the leader of a top second-rated force. Jian Wushuang was looking forward to what he could find inside Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring.

“I hope you won’t let me down.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes twinkled excitedly and began to check the ring’s contents.

He found countless treasures and various cultivation resources.

There were more than 2,000,000,000 and nearing 3,000,000,000 Primordial Stones in the Interspatial Ring.

In addition, there were many Divine Elixir Pills.

“He was indeed a wealthy Grand Ultimate God as he had four thousand Divine Elixir Pills.” Jian Wushuang grinned faintly.

4,000 Divine Elixir Pills was a huge amount as he had yet to collect that many Divine Elixir Pills even after destroying several third-rated forces.

Fo Yi had so many Divine Elixir Pills because he was the leader of a top-tier second-rated force as ordinary Grand Ultimate God would not have that many Divine Elixir Pills.

In the Danyang Continent, it was already considered very good if an ordinary Grand Ultimate God had 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills.
