Chapter 2150 Overwhelming Superiority

The three Blood Thunder Pearls immediately exploded upon contact with the Great Emperor.

Peng!

Peng!

Peng!

Three violent forces erupted from the Blood Thunder Pearls.

The power was directed towards that Three Emperors World Great Emperor, and at the same time, Master Wu made his lethal sword stroke.

Hong!

A storm of Divine Power immediately rolled up. After it had dissipated, what remained was an unbearable scene of the Great Emperor.

Not only was his complexion pale, his entire body was also stained with blood, and his breath was extremely weak.

“Did we injure him enough?” The three Emperor Gods and twelve pinnacle Sir Gods eyes lit up. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Their Secret Skills of Star Palace had stopped by then.

“Without the Secret Skills of Star Palace, we can no longer engage ourselves in Great Emperor-level fights. Let’s leave the rest to Master Wu.”

Immediately, the giant left for another battlefield.

The same scenario was happening at all corners of the battlefield.

The Sanctuary Alliance had over a hundred Blood Thunder Pearls, and every pearl contained the power equivalent to a Great Emperor when it exploded.

The Blood Thunder Pearls were distributed in the hands of many Emperor Gods and Sir Gods, and played a great role at critical times.

All the trump cards and meticulously prepared treasures helped the Eternal Chaotic World army bring unprecedented damage to the Three Emperors World.

The situation on the battlefield was completely one-sided!

There was no room for struggle.

Actually, the overall strength of the Three Emperors World was not weaker than the Eternal Chaotic World by one bit. Perhaps it was even stronger.

However, they suffered because they had been caught by surprise. They were unprepared.

They had suffered terrible losses from the very beginning. By the time they could react, their power was no match for the Eternal Chaotic World. The most they could do was block the Eternal Chaotic World’s attacks.

The defence could not last for long.

As the Eternal Chaotic World’s army charged towards the Three Emperors World experts, Emperor Bai made his move at the other battlefield.

His opponents were naturally Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu.

Wong!

A huge, immaculate golden shadow rose from behind Emperor Bai.

It was a golden emperor.

He was ninety-nine thousand feet tall, three thousand feet wide, with a pair of golden pupils that could see everything. Like a golden arc, it was as if the entire world had surrendered under his feet.

As the golden shadow appeared, Emperor Bai’s aura reached its climax.

He made his move.

The white, slender arm made a fist, and explosive power began to be concentrated.

The ninety-nine thousand foot golden shadow did the same and held his right fist tightly.

Emperor Bai punched out.

Hong long long~~

The Void in front scattered instantly.

It swept over everything.

It was as if nothing, including heaven and earth, space and time, could resist that punch.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu’s faces changed.

They had both fought against Emperor Bai before. They knew how scary he was.

The punch and its imposing power frightened both of them.

“Together,” Lord Fen billowed. His flames rised towards the sky once again, the fiery lord he had morphed into also rose to hundreds of feet tall.

He was like the master of the world’s flames.

As the fiery lord held the flame sword with both of his hands, the sword started to emit a terrifying power.

The power ha billowing Divine Power, secret skills, and Rules of Order.

The Rules of Order were extremely violent.

“Cut!”

The fiery lord let out a loud roar, and the fiery blade swung down immediately.

The fiery power from the draw of the blade incinerated everything around into dust.

Demon King Chen Yu made his move as well.

He displayed his eight arms, each holding a divine weapon.

At that moment, the eight divine weapons unleashed their potential and charged towards Emperor Bai.

Soon, their attacks came into contact with Emperor Bai’s shocking punch.

Peng!

A loud bang.

The large golden fist rammed through the flaming blade, crushing Demon King Chen Yu’s eight divine weapons, and continued its attack.

Hong long long ~~~ a terrifying power was in play.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu were darting out like bombshells.

“Too strong!” Lord Fen marvelled.

Jian Wushuang, who had witnessed that scene from afar, was dumbfounded as well.

“One versus two, crushing the enemies as well. Emperor Bai is strong indeed.”

Demon King Chen Yu only possessed average Third Stage Great Emperor fighting powers.

But Lord Fen was near pinnacle Third Stage level, yet he was ridiculously far behind Emperor Bai.

“This will be much easier now that Emperor Bai has joined the fight,” Jian Wushuang smiled and stared at his opponent.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu were both marked by Emperor Bai. Now, Jian Wushuang’s only opponent left was Ba Su.

“Let’s do this, Ba Su!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was harsh and charged towards him.

Back at the Imperial City, the battle had become extremely intense.

But the situation was obvious: the Three Emperors World experts were retreating.

The gap between the two worlds’ overall power was getting wider.

This excited many experts of the Eternal Chaotic World.

They knew that the opponent was about to crumble. They just needed to continue to fight on, and victory would be theirs.

But, as Three Emperors World was at the verge of collapse:

Wong!

A beautiful crimson figure appeared above the Imperial City via Space Tunnel.

His appearance was well marked by his strong bloodlust.

The smell of blood, its density, was unprecedented. Many experts could not help but turn over.

The Three Emperors World experts were elated.

On the other hand, the Eternal Chaotic World’s experts’ pupils shrunk sharply.

“Kaiser Blood?”

“He’s finally arrived?” Emperor Bai showed a baffling smile.
