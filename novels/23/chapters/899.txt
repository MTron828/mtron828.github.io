“By the way, since you have passed the third level of the Black Tower, you can now leave the Stellar Fog Sea, right?”Zi Dong looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, that’s true. But I am the only one who can leave.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint nod: “I asked Lord Spirit Sound if I can take you guys with me, but the answer was no.”

Zi Dong, Qian Yu and Ling Long looked at each other without speaking; they were not surprised to hear this result.

“I really envy you.” Qian Yu praised. “You are the most talented among us, after you is Zi Dong. He has passed the second level and may have a chance to leave in the future. But as for me and Ling Long, maybe we will be stuck here forever. ”

On hearing this, Ling Long expressed a bitter smile.

“No, you won’t be kept here forever. I’ve asked Lord Spirit Sound, and he told me that if someone is able to pass the task of the fourth Black Tower, he will be the master of the Stellar Fog Sea. Then, you will have the chance to leave.” said Jian Wushuang seriously:”I will do everything I can to improve my strength once i leave the Stellar Fog Sea. I promise I will come back if it’s possible, and then I will pass the task of the fourth Black Tower to get you out.”

“Aha. I’m so happy to hear that.” Qian Yu grinned.

“Blood Mountain, we will depend on you now.” Zi Dong said with a smile. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I trust you.”Ling Long took a solemn look at Jian Wushuang.

“Well, I’m about to leave the Star Island soon. But first, we should get a have drink together.” Jian Wushuang laughed and said.

Zi Dong and the other three also made their own toasts.

Jian Wushuang stood up after just one shot.

“Zi Dong, you know that Qian Yu and Ling Long are not so strong. You should take care of them in the Star Island from now on.”

“You can count on me.” Zi Dong nodded.

“My three friends, take care.”Jian Wushuang left after saying these words.

But of course Jian Wushuang didn’t leave immediately. Instead he made his way to a castle made of black stone on the edge of the Island.

The master of this castle is one of the five Dao Masters of the Star Island–Dao Master Kong Ming.

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the Blackstone castle, he then bowed slightly to the castle and then his loud voice rang out.

“Dao Master Kong Ming, Blood Mountain is here to pay you a visit.”

“Enter.” Said a voice from inside the castle.

Jian Wushuang rushed into the castle and arrived at the garden, he then saw a middle-aged man with moustache in a cyan long gown, carefully tending the flowers.

The middle-aged man stopped what he was doing when Jian Wushuang entered. He turned his head slowly to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Mountain, you have passed the third level of the Black Tower and you are able to leave Star Island. So tell me, what is your purpose here?”Dao Master Kong Ming said in a calm voice. A elegant aura spread out from him as he spoke.

“I come here to ask you a favor.”Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes?” Asked the Dao Master Kong Ming.

“To be honest with you, I came to this Stellar Fog Sea for only one reason, and that is the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit.” Jian Wushuang openly expressed his intensions.

The eyes of the Dao Master Kong Ming narrowed when he heard Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit, his gaze fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Dao Master Kong Ming, I’m aware that you have a Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit in possession. Fifty thousand years ago, you were being hunted by someone and had to flee into Stellar Fog Sea when you saw no other option. And now with the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit in still in your possession, I was hoping that you could do me a favor, and I, Blood Mountain, will always remember that you did me this favor.” Jian Wushuang said in a serious tone.

“Remember this favor?”Dao Master Kong Ming uttered a snorting laugh, “Blood Mountain, how dare you treat me like a fool?”

“I’m now trapped in the Star Island. What’s the use of your favor when I hardly have any chance of leaving? Moreover, the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit is of great value and is quite meaningful to me. If it weren’t for the Fruit, I wouldn’t have been hunted and never would have fled to the Stellar Fog Sea.”

“Fifty thousand years ago, I chose to come to the Stellar Fog Sea rather than hand over the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit. And now, you want to trade this Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit with your worthless favor? How naive of you.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes after hearing this.

He had no idea that the Dao Master Kong Ming had been hunted because of a Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit.

“Dao Master Kong Ming, that Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit is useless to you now since you are trapped in the Star Island. But to me, it is of huge value. Besides, I believe that my favor might be of use to you.”

“Lord Spirit Sound told me that if anyone can pass the task of the fourth Black Tower, then he can take control of the Stellar Fog Sea, which means he can control the lives of everyone within. And this fourth Black Tower, as long as I have the ability, I will do my best to pass.”

“The fourth Black Tower, you say?” Dao Master Kong Ming glanced at Jian Wushuang with surprise, and then snarled, “Not even the Dao Masters have the ability to do so. What makes you think you can pass such a challenge.

“I have no assurance of success.” Jian Wushuang said truthfully, “The fourth Black Tower is indeed currently beyond my ability, and it is true I have no faith passing. Nevertheless, I still have the potential for success.”

“It may seem quite unlikely, but there is hope!”

“The Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit cannot help you in any way right now, so why not exchange it for the only chance of leaving the Star Island Star Island. I believe that you, Dao Master Kong Ming will make the right choice. ”

Jian Wushuang said with sincerity.

He had no choice for the Fruit was in the hands of the Dao Master Kong Ming. And though Kong Ming is a Dao Master expert, he could not pass the first level of the Black Tower. However he had spent fifty thousand years in the Star Island, and had cultivated a very powerful Secret Skill, not to mention his own ability. It is true his strength was way above that of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang needed to remain polite; he must try to convince the Dao Master Kong Ming to give him Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit willingly.

Dao Master Kong Ming narrowed his eyes a little when Jian Wushuang finished his speech, and he succumbed to deep thought.

It didn’t take long for Dao Master Kong Ming to make up his mind.

He looked up at Jian Wushuang again, with a smile on his face.

“You do have amazing talents!”

In the long history of Star Island, only two people have managed to leave. You are one of the two people, the other one is Star King from four million years ago.

“Being able to leave the Stellar Fog Sea alive, you two are true exceptional genius. And you may even be stronger than Star King in terms of talent.”
