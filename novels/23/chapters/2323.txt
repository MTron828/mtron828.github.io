Chapter 2324 Returning to Incineration Moon City

Incineration Moon City, the Governor’s Mansion.Zhuo Yunfeng, Luo Xinqin, and many guards and servants had received news of Jian Wushuang’s return and were waiting for him at the gate.

“Father, Mother,” Jian Wushuang bowed to the parents of his current life.

“Haha, it’s been almost four years, boy. You’ve grown taller.” Zhuo Yunfeng looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled.

“Not just taller, more mature.” Luo Xinqin smiled as she squeezed Jian Wushuang’s cheeks.

Jian Wushuang was comforted.

Regardless of the Zhuo Yunfeng couple of this life, or the Jian Nantian couple of his previous, they were all his closest family.

“Brother Lin Yi, oh, Brother Lin Ao is here as well?” Zhuo Yunfeng noticed the two Lin Family experts that had escorted Jian Wushuang. “Thank you so much.”

“No problem, the young Lord has helped the Lin Family quite a bit during this period of time. It’s natural we return the favour, orders from our Head,” Lin Ao said.

“You’re too kind,” Zhuo Yunfeng replied.

“Brother Zhuo.” Lin Yi’s gaze turned solemn. “To be honest, I was the only one escorting him back today. But Little Wushuang was intercepted by Zhuge Family experts. Luckily, we survived. Lin Ao followed us afterwards as a safety precaution.”

“Intercepted?” Zhuo Yunfeng’s face changed.

“Intercepted by a Half Step Divine Demon. It was serious,” Lin Ao said.

Zhuo Yunfeng’s frown grew deeper. Luo Xinqin beside asked Jian Wushuang worriedly, “Shuang, are you okay then?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Of course, thanks to Uncle Lin Yi.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“We are grateful,” Zhuo Yunfeng thanked them once again.

After they exchanged greetings, Zhuo Yunfeng wanted to invite Lin Yi and Lin Ao to stay for a few days, but Jian Wushuang dragged them to a corner.

“I have something I would like the two of you to help with,” Jian Wushuang asked humbly.

“No problem,” Lin Yi was impressed by Jian Wushuang’s skills and agreed immediately.

“The both of you should leave the Incineration Moon City immediately, but don’t go too far. Come back quietly at night, and hide within the Incineration Moon City,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Little Wushuang, you mean...” Lin Yi and Lin Ao looked at Jian Wushuang.

They understood Jian Wushuang’s intentions.

“If the Zhuge Family tried to kill me once, they will try again. Although I’m safe with my father at the Incineration Moon City, as a safety precaution, I hope both of you will stay for a month, no longer than that. If the Zhuge Family does not make their move by then, they probably will not any more. If they do, at least you can help me, “Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood, Lin Mansion should be safe by the end of the month anyway. We’ll stay in the city for a month,” Lin Ao said directly.

“Thank you both, but please be careful,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” Lin Yi and Lin Ao replied and left.

Soon, under the gaze of many, they left the city openly.

But not long after, they returned without a trace.

Within the Governor’s Mansion, the Zhuo Yunfeng couple and Jian Wushuang gathered together.

“Shuang, how have you been these four years?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked.

“Not bad, they took care of me well. I ate well, slept well,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Rascal, who asked you about that?”

“How’s your cultivation?” Zhuo Yunfeng laughed as he scolded him.

As his father, Zhuo Yunfeng was most concerned with Jian Wushuang’s abilities and speed of growth.

Luo Xinqin could not have cared less for those, as long as Jian Wushuang was happy.

“My cultivation base improved quite a bit, and my Sword Principle as well,” Jian Wushuang said as a Divine Power aura was released from him.

“Hmm... this is... Pure Sun Realm?” Zhuo Yunfeng was shocked. “How could it be? When you left, you were only an Early Transformed God, but you reached Pure Sun Realm levels in four years?”

What Zhuo Yunfeng did not know was that Jian Wushuang had concealed his Divine Power, releasing only early Pure Sun Realm levels.

If Zhuo Yunfeng knew he had already reached Mid Pure Sun Realm levels, he would have been even more shocked.

“I got lucky,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“Rascal, you surprise me by the day. If you didn’t show your Divine Power aura, even I could not have guessed. What kind of Aura Concealment Skill did you learn?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked.

“I learnt it a long time ago within the Mansion, but I forgot what skill was it. It’s good though,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Is it?” Zhuo Yunfeng had his doubts.

The secret skills within the Mansion were all his, but he did not recall one with such powerful Aura Concealment Skills.

Jian Wushuang did not explain further.

He had roamed the world for a hundred thousand years in his past life, learning countless skills, the Aura Concealment Skill included. Even true Divine Demons would not be able to tell if he did not reveal his aura himself.

“Forget it, I will not ask too much. But what happened on the way back? Why was there a Half Step Divine Demon going after you?” Zhuo Yunfeng frowned.

Luo Xinqin looked over as well.

Jian Wushuang briefly recounted what had happened at the Lin Mansion without concealing anything, including the part where he had defeated Zhuge Hong.

“That’s what happened, huh?”

Zhuo Yunfeng’s face darkened. “The Zhuge Family and Lin Family had been fighting for years. Now that the Zhuge Family is finally slightly stronger than the Lin Family, along with Zhuge Hong, I think they are about to finally make their move.”
