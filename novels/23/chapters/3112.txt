Sect Master Yingyue looked at the two people around her in astonishment.

Although they were only rank one True Saints, she was very clear about their origins and identities. Even she was polite to them and did not put on any airs.

But now, these two people actually treated each other so humbly. They called each other ‘sir’ and even addressed each other as ‘you’?

Who was this person?

“It’s you two.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the black-haired evil-looking young man and the white-robed woman.

They were the two geniuses from the Primitive Palace he met in the bone region, the evil master and Mirage Water.

When the three geniuses from the Primitive Palace joined hands, they were easily defeated by Jian Wushuang. Later, on the Heaven-cleaving Star...they saw Jian Wushuang easily defeat Gu Tong, the number one genius of the first stage of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Naturally, they were in awe of Jian Wushuang.

“It’s rare that you still remember us.” The evil master smiled. “Not long ago, we saw you on the Heaven-cleaving Star. However, there were too many people, so we didn’t come forward to greet you. Later, you entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm and stayed there for a long time. We don’t know when you left.”

“Heaven-cleaving Star? Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?” When the Moon Reflection Sect Master heard these words, her pupils contracted secretly. “Young friend evil master, could it be that this young brother is also a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces?”

“No, no. Sir Heavenly Sword Marquis is not a subordinate of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces,” said the evil master.

“Then why did he go to the Heaven-cleaving Star and enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?” The Moon Reflection Sect Master was puzzled.

She was the Sect Master of the Holy Feather Sect after all and had some knowledge. She had heard of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm before.

The Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm was one of the greatest opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Even within the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, only a handful of people were qualified to enter it.

“Sect Master Ying Yue, you may not know this, but although Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis is not a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces personally gave the order to make an exception for Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm once.” The evil master said with a smile.

“Three Palace Masters make an exception?” Moon Reflection Sect Master was stunned, and huge waves immediately surged up from the bottom of his heart.

The three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces were all supreme existences.

They were the top-notch Principles Masters. Any one of these supreme experts was enough to sweep through the entire First Heaven.

For example, although the three pavilions and nine courtyards of the First Heaven had a certain level of strength, they were nothing in front of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s Palace Masters.

How could the three Palace Masters make an exception for the Heavenly Sword Marquis in front of them?

Sect Master Ying Yue stared at Jian Wushuang with a strange expression.

“Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis, why are you here in the Holy Feather Sect?” The evil master asked.

“I followed her here.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Prince Qing.

“Her?” The evil master looked at Prince Qing and asked curiously, “Is this girl related to you, Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Sort of.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “I’ll be her guard for a while.”

“Guard?” The evil master’s expression became even more strange.

Sect Master Yingyue’s eyes lit up, and then she stepped forward and asked, “Girl, what’s your name, and where are you from?”

Sect Master Yingyue’s question made her nervous and excited. She suppressed her emotions and answered, “Sect Master, my name is Mu Qing, and I’m from the True Martial Kingdom.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sect Master, this Mu Qing has Elder Qi Chen’s token. She came here this time to enter Elder Qi Chen’s tutelage. However, Elder Qi Chen asked her to break through this sky puppet array. She can only become his personal disciple after enduring for twenty breaths in the sky puppet array. This Mu Qing only lasted for nineteen breaths. Therefore, she can only become an in-name disciple.” The weathered elder at the side said immediately.

“In-name disciple?” The Moon Reflection Sect’s Sect Master frowned slightly. “This girl’s tenacity and willpower are both very good. I also find her very pleasing to the eye. How about this? Let Elder Qi Chen give her to me. I haven’t accepted a disciple in a long time either.”

“Sect Master, you want to accept her as a disciple?” The vicissitudes of life old man looked over in astonishment.

Princess Qing also raised her head abruptly and looked at the Moon Reflection Sect’s Sect Master in disbelief.

“I want to take you in as a disciple, and a personal disciple at that.” The Sect Master of the Reflection Moon Sect looked at His Highness Qing, “However, there are certain conditions for you to become my disciple. I still have some matters that I have yet to settle. After some time has passed, I will personally arrange a test for you. If you can pass my test, you can become my personal disciple. How about it?”

“Thank you, Lord Sect Master!” Prince Qing was pleasantly surprised.

“You are welcome.” Sect Master Ying Yue waved his hand.

“May I ask, Lord Sect Master, how long will it take for the test to be ready?” Clearly, Prince Qing was somewhat anxious.

“Why are you so anxious? Do you have other matters?” Sect Master Ying Yue looked over.

“Yes, I do.” Prince Qing hesitated for a moment. Then, he briefly recounted some of the things that had happened in the Zhen Wu Kingdom.

“The competition for the ruler? So that’s how it is?” The expression of the Sect Master of the Moon Reflecting Sect changed. “You want my Holy Feather Sect to step forward and help your Sixth Brother?”

“Yes.” His Highness Qing clenched his teeth.

The Sect Master of the Moon Reflecting Sect glanced at His Highness Qing and immediately smiled. “Your talent is not bad. Moreover, I admire your tenacity and perseverance. Even if you are unable to pass my test and become my personal disciple in the end, it is not a problem for you to become a core disciple of my Holy Feather Sect. Since you have encountered some trouble now, my Holy Feather Sect will naturally step forward to help you.”

“Xin Sect.”

Sect Master Ying Yue glanced at the weathered elder and said, “Go and invite Elder Zi Xing. Ask him to go to the True Martial Kingdom with you. Help this girl solve the troubles in the True Martial Kingdom and then come back.”

“Yes.” The weathered elder nodded respectfully and immediately went to invite Elder Zi Xing.

“Thank you, Sect Master!” Prince Qing was very excited, and Yuan Chong was also so excited that his body was trembling.

“I told you there was no need to be so polite.” The Moon Reflection Sect Master only smiled faintly, but her eyes were looking at Jian Wushuang, whether intentionally or not.

Jian Wushuang had been standing there with his arms crossed. His expression was cold as if it had nothing to do with what was in front of him.

However, although Jian Wushuang did not make any movements, he could still see that the reason why the Moon Reflection Sect Master wanted to take Prince Qing as a personal disciple and asked the Holy Feather Sect to solve the trouble in the genuine force country was because of him, it was because of him.

Not long after, the weathered elder came with Elder Zi Xing.

The aura that Elder Zi Xing emitted was that of a genuine rank six True Saint!
