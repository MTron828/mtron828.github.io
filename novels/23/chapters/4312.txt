4313 Fighting Four Great Supremes Alone!

In the vast universe, a universe boat that was shining with a dark luster stood quietly.

In front of universe boat, four supreme beings with powerful auras and different appearances stood together with their hands behind their backs, blocking the way.

“Jian Wushuang, stop. I’ll spare your life as long as you hand over the Tarot Divine Sword, considering your rare talent.” A grey-haired old man wearing a robe with stars in the sky said.

If there were cultivators from the Seven Palace Star Area here, they would recognize that this old man was the Ruler of the Seven Palace Star Area, the Seven Palace Supreme who had been in closed-door cultivation for many years.

Ruler Seven Palaces had spent dozens of chaos cycles in secluded meditation within the Earth’s core, seeking enlightenment of the Dao. He hadn’t expected that the appearance of the Tarot sword would actually draw him out.

that’s right. Jian Wushuang, hand over the Tarot Divine Sword and I can guarantee your life.

Another old woman with her silver hair coiled up and holding a twisted dragon head walking stick also spoke.

This old woman was the master of Lotus Heart Island. She was also a Supreme-being expert.

“Hand over the Tarot Divine Sword, and I’ll spare your life!”

hehehe, quickly recognize the situation and don’t make any unnecessary resistance.

As for the other two Supreme martial artists, one of them had an eerie aura like a ghost, while the other had a solemn appearance. They were both famous Supreme martial artists in the universe.

Jian Wushuang stood in the universe boat and looked at the four through the black light mirror with a gloomy expression.

He had been extremely careful, and the journey to the Divine Life Palace had been full of twists and turns. Sometimes, he had even done the opposite. He had not expected that it would still be the same, and he would still be stopped.

“Could it be…are you really going to hand over the Tarot Divine Sword?”

Jian Wushuang lowered his head to look at the Tarot Divine Sword at his waist, and a touch of coldness flashed in his eyes.

He was afraid that he would still be killed if he handed over the Tarot sword. After all, he had stolen a treasure from a top-tier genius in the universe. It was better to eliminate the root to avoid future trouble.

The reason why they were still circling around Jian Wushuang was that none of them wanted to be the first to stand out and offend the Divine Life Palace, in case they got their revenge later.

However, Jian Wushuang believed that this was only temporary. Before long, someone would make a move. Between the threat of the Divine Life Palace and the Tarot Divine Sword, they would naturally choose the latter.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang walked out of universe boat step by step. He had already made a decision.

The current him, with the Tarot Divine Sword in hand, was not afraid of these Supreme martial artists!

As long as any of the four Supremes dared to make the first move, Jian Wushuang would risk everything and use the Tarot Divine Sword to kill the first person!

“Oh? Finally willing to come out?”

The Seven Palaces Supreme raised his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang as he spoke indifferently.

The other three great masters also put on a fake smile. They looked at the Tarot Divine Sword on Jian Wushuang’s back, only revealing its hilt, and their eyes flashed with unconcealed greed.

The Tarot Divine Sword was a universe treasure!

Whoever could obtain the Tarot Divine Sword would be able to increase their strength by several times!

“Jian, Jian Wushuang, come. Give me the Tarot Divine Sword and I’ll let you go.”

In front of the Tarot Divine Sword, even these Supreme martial artists couldn’t help but swallow their saliva and lose their composure.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang pulled out the Tarot Divine Sword from his back and pointed the tip of the sword at the four great Supremes. He tilted his head and sneered, “I’m sorry, but I won’t hand over the Tarot Divine Sword. If anyone wants to take it, you can try.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with fighting intent.

People often said that those who did not enter the Supreme Divine Realm were still ants. The difference between a Supreme and a Ruler was like the difference between a God and a mortal. Today, Jian Wushuang might as well slaughter a God and show the world!

“Jian Wushuang, are you threatening us?”

The Seven Palace Rulers were so angry that they laughed. They were universe Rulers, yet they were threatened by an ultimate Ruler?

“If you don’t believe me, you can try.” Jian Wushuang looked at him with a calm expression.

“You!”

The Seven Palaces Supreme was furious when he heard this, but he seemed to have thought of something. After snorting coldly, he did not say anything else.

The Black Eagle Ruler’s corpse was probably still cold, so he was not sure if Jian Wushuang, who was holding the Tarot Divine Sword, would be able to kill him.

For a moment, the atmosphere fell into a strange stalemate. The four great Supremes’ faces were gloomy as they looked at the Tarot Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand. Their eyes were full of greed and there was a touch of deep fear.

In the end, it was still the man in black with the sinister aura who laughed sinisterly, “If we don’t act now, we might not have a chance when the others come.”

When the three of them heard this, their faces turned cold. That’s right, the entire universe was after Jian Wushuang, and no one knew when another Supreme would come to this place.

Immediately, the master of Lotus Heart Island, a hunchbacked old woman with her hair tied up, said in a hoarse voice, “In this Queen’s opinion, the four of us should join forces to kill this brat first. As for the ownership of the Tarot Divine Sword, we’ll choose the strongest person from the four of us.”

The four Supreme martial artists looked at each other and quickly made a decision.

“Kill Jian Wushuang first!”

Looking at this scene, Jian Wushuang’s face was unmoved, but his heart was filled with the desire to fight to the death!

What about the four great masters?

Just a battle!

“Go!”

The black-robed man with a sinister aura sneered first. A nine-headed scimitar that emitted a strange aura appeared in his hand. He took a step forward and charged at Jian Wushuang!

The other three great Supremes also unleashed their Dao techniques. The seven Palace supremely pulled with his hands, and seven fist-sized round beads suddenly appeared. These seven round beads were refined from seven planets, and each round bead’s attack was no less powerful than the self-destruction of a planet. When seven round beads were used to form a formation, the power would be extremely great.

As for the old woman, she took a step forward and countless red lotus flowers appeared in the sky.

The four great masters had attacked Jian Wushuang at the same time!

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted coldly and he poured all his divine power into the Tarot Divine Sword!

...

In an instant, a terrifyingly sharp destructive aura rose sharply with Jian Wushuang as the center!

The eye on the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand suddenly opened!

Countless threads of blood filled the air.

“This aura…it really is the Tarot Divine Sword!”

When the four great Supremes felt this majestic aura that could destroy the heavens and earth, they trembled all over, and their hair stood on end.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang’s figure became blurry and was replaced by a carefree figure who was drunk on the world and riding on a sword.

That was supremacy Tarot!

“Slash!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A cold voice was heard. Jian Wushuang held the Tarot Divine Sword in his hand and slashed at the four great Supremes!

A dark golden sword light that could illuminate the sun and the moon burst out from the Tarot Divine Sword. It was as if a Great Tribulation had descended from the heavens, and it rudely attacked the four great Rulers!

The four great Rulers looked at the sword, and their pupils shrank. The old woman said in a deep voice, “Everyone, Jian Wushuang already has the power to kill a Supreme with the help of the Tarot Divine Sword. We must not underestimate him and follow in the footsteps of the Black Eagle Ruler!”
