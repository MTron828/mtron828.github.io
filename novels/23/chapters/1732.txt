Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the vast, dark sea area, Jian Wushuang was floating amidst the dark, dense fog and he was looking down at the gigantic triangular island in front of him. His expression turned grave slowly.

He could see that the triangular island was engulfed by a dark storm. Within the dark storm, gusts of wind were blowing about like sharp blades and the void was cut open like paper.

Jian Wushuang also felt great danger from the dark storm.

He then took out his token and sent a message to Lei Chao to ask him some questions, “Lei Chao, I have already arrived at a triangular island. This island is engulfed in a dark storm. Are you inside this island?”

“That’s right. It’s that place.” Lei Chao replied immediately, “I have been completely trapped by the dark storm and I dare not move about randomly.”

“It’s alright if I’m correct. Please wait inside. I will go in and find you,” after speaking, Jian Wushuang approached the triangular island slowly.

“This dark storm…” As Jian Wushuang looked at the dark storm in front of him, he did not dare to underestimate the heartless sharp blades which were blowing about in the slightest. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang flipped his hands and a purple saber appeared in his hands. After that, he tossed the purple saber into the dark storm in front of him.

A dark, sharp blade then headed to the purple saber and sliced it into fine powder instantly.

“What a strong power. That saber is a top Universe God-level Chaos Unique Treasure. However, it was destroyed instantly. With such frightening dark wind blades… although my body is strong, if I were to be caught in-between a few dark wind blades at the same time, I would probably not end up in a good state,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in admiration.

It was no wonder that Lei Chao was trapped within the dark storm and that he dared not walk around randomly. After all, the dark storm also posed a great threat to Almighties.

However, although it was dangerous, in order to bring Lei Chao out, Jian Wushuang still walked into the dark storm.

…

At a hidden void which was deep inside the dark storm, there were four black-robed figures.

“Jian Wushuang has come.”

“Hehe, since he has come, he shall not think of leaving this place alive.”

“It’s about time for Mo Ying to make a move.”

“He’s a top genius. However, it’s a pity that he is about to die.”

The four black-robed figures were gasping at their location. However, the four faces under the black robes were not filled with sympathy at all. Instead, they were filled with cruelty and madness.

In the dark storm, Jian Wushuang’s right hand was holding his Blood Mountain Sword and he was walking forward slowly. His eyes were filled with vigilance.

Puff!

All of a sudden, a sound that sounded like the void being ripped open could be heard. Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank and he swung the sword in his hands abruptly.

A dark wind blade was repelled by Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword head-on.

Jian Wushuang did not stop moving and he continued to walk forward.

The dark storm was still considered very stable and Jian Wushuang only needed to pay attention to the dark wind blades that appeared from his surroundings. As long as the dark wind blades were unable to touch him, he would not be in any danger.

“I wonder which part of the storm Lei Chao will be in,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The dark storm had completely prevented him from using his Soul Power to check out the area. Hence, he did not know Lei Chao’s current location and he could only search slowly.

However, what Jian Wushuang did not know was that at the same time, within the dark storm, a ghost-like figure was hidden not too far away from his back.

The black-robed figure was like a ghost. Ever since Jian Wushuang had entered the dark storm, he had been following Jian Wushuang closely. However, from the start to the end, Jian Wushuang did not notice his existence.

Under the black robe, a pair of dark green eyes which had the will-o’-the-wisp dancing about them were staring at Jian Wushuang who was in front persistently. She had also suppressed the aura in her body to its maximum and she was just like the air.

She was waiting. She was waiting for the best opportunity to strike.

Puff! Puff! Puff!

All of a sudden, three soft sounds which broke the silence in the air could be heard from his surroundings. Jian Wushuang noticed them instantly and with a wave of his hands, three sword essence struck the three dark wind blades which were heading toward him with lightning speed.

The three dark wind blades were dispersed instantly.

However, at that moment…

“The time is now!”

The eyes of the black-robed figure who had been following Jian Wushuang closely while hiding herself extremely well glowed with a shrill light and she floated over like a ghost.

Her speed was too fast.

When Jian Wushuang had only just swung his sword to get rid of the three dark wind blades which approached him, the ghost-like figure had already appeared behind him. At the same time, a cold dagger appeared in her hands and the dagger headed toward Jian Wushuang’s head abruptly.

It was a speed that was faster than all the speeds in the universe.

At that moment, the space and time seemed to have completely stopped. Only the extremely cold dagger remained in the whole universe.

It was too fast.

The person who attacked was definitely a top expert who was proficient in assassination. Be it the opportunity to strike, the way of attacking or speed, she was perfect in all of them.

Although Jian Wushuang had been vigilant throughout, up until the moment that the ghost-like figure had appeared behind him and even attacked with her dagger, Jian Wushuang had still not reacted to it.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful!” a cry which sounded like thunder echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind fiercely.

Jian Wushuang’s body trembled and he was terrified. At that moment, all the pores on his body expanded quickly and a special feeling appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Such a feeling was the feeling of life and death.

He had felt the frightening feeling of danger which came from behind him.

Although the frightening feeling of danger was not unprecedented, from the time that Jian Wushuang started training to present, he had felt it no more than two times. Jian Wushuang even had an illusion that he was about to die.

He did his best to move his body in order to avoid the deadly blow behind him.

“Faster, faster!”

“Even faster, even faster!”

Jian Wushuang was roaring crazily in his mind and he did his best to move himself as much as possible.

After all, the more he moved, the higher the chance of him surviving.

“Die!”

At that moment, the ghost-like figure who launched a surprise attack abruptly did not hide herself any longer. Her shocking murderous intent had completely locked on to Jian Wushuang and the dagger in her hands which was emitting an infinite amount of coldness was getting closer and closer to Jian Wushuang’s head.

However, at that moment, rustle~~~ all of a sudden, a gigantic tentacle came out from Jian Wushuang’s back fiercely and it struck the dagger with lightning speed straight away.

As the dagger contained frightening power, it smashed the tentacle into pieces instantly. Moreover, it continued to head toward Jian Wushuang without any decrease in power.

However, with the tentacle blocking for just an instant, Jian Wushuang had just managed to move his body.

Swish!

The dagger which contained an infinite amount of murderous intent brushed past Jian Wushuang’s head and the cold light which the dagger was emitting left a wound on Jian Wushuang’s cheek, causing blood to flow out from it.

“Piss off!”

Jian Wushuang gave a loud cry and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands released a shocking amount of power. It then attacked furiously, like a huge mountain which was hundreds of millions Jin heavy.
