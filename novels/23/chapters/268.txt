Chapter 269: Chen Feng

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He... he’s Chen Feng?”

Sitting in his chair, Jian Wushuang had also seen the purple-haired man.

However, Chen Feng only had eyes for Ye Se and Jun Yi. He hadn’t paid him any mind at all.

The gathering would begin soon.

The process for this gathering between the disciples of the various old sects was exceedingly simple. They would simply go out onto the Martial Arts Practice Field, and every sect’s genius disciple could make contact with whomever they wished. Whoever you wanted to fight with, you would step in front of them and ask for a fight. For the most part none of them would refuse.

They quickly went out onto the Martial Arts Practice Field and each match began amongst the disciples.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang watched with keen interest.

He had to say, the theory and power of these old sect geniuses was not ordinary. Whether it was their Cultivation of Spiritual Power or realization of various concepts, they were all significantly stronger than the geniuses of the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties.

However, after watching three matches, he lost interest.

The reason was simple; in all of the fights between the disciples, they pulled their punches. It was merely an ordinary battle in order to compare notes with one another, none of them were true life-or-death brawls.

When he had been a part of the Easternmost Hunting in the beginning of the Tianzong Dynasty, the selection battles were all life-or-death struggles from the start. For the sake of gaining the favor of the old sects, everyone used every last ounce of their strength in order to attempt to kill their opponent. A great number of experts perished.

The cruelty of the Easternmost Hunting was extreme compared to this so-called gathering of disciples.

In comparison to the Easternmost Hunting, even though the level of power of the disciples in this gathering between the old sects was quite high, the nature of the whole event was completely different.

“Swordsman, my friend, what do you think of these sects’ geniuses?” Ling Han glanced over.

“They’re alright.” Jian Wushuang responded unenthusiastically.

Ling Han raised his eyebrows and said no more.

Half the day passed quickly.

During this period of time, there were no less than a dozen of these matches where the old sect disciples took notes and learned from one another. However, despite the fact that there were so many confrontations, the most disastrous event was merely that one genius sustained an injury. In all of the other matches, they pulled their punches and didn’t overdo it.

“Every sect’s disciple has come out, all that’s left is our Daluo Heaven Sect and the Wilderness Sword Sect.” Ling Han’s eyes narrowed, “Ye Se, it’s almost time!”

Ling Han looked at Ye Se, who immediately nodded his head in understanding and then stood up.

As he got up, nearly all eyes in the entire Martial Arts Practice Field were on him.

“Ye Se’s coming out to the arena.”

“Haha, finally the climax of this gathering of disciples has arrived.”

“We’ve been here all day, finally there’s something worth seeing.”

All of the sect experts in the arena sighed.

After Ye Se stood up, he quickly walked into the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field and directed his gaze towards the Wilderness Sword Sect.

“Chen Feng, come out. Out of all of the young generation disciples in all of the sects of the Northern Region, only you can battle with me.” Ye Se’s voice carried foward, echoing throughout the interior of the entire Martial Arts Practice Field.

Even though his words were somewhat arrogant, there was no expert from any sect in the entire arena who was rubbed the wrong way. After all, Ye Se spoke the truth.

After hearing Ye Se’s words, that baby-faced purple-haired man who was in the midst of the Wilderness Sword Sect stood up.

“Chen Feng.”

Beside him, a voice rang out. It came from the tall and sturdy middle aged leader of the Wilderness Sword Sect. The cultivation of this tall and study middle aged body was at the half-saint level, and he was an Elder of the Wilderness Sword Sect as well.

This Gathering of the disciples would happen once every year. It was just an ordinary occasion to exchange ideas and compare notes, so many of the sects from the Northern Region didn’t attach a great deal of importance to it. The Wilderness Sword Sect was like this as well, so ordinarily an Expert of the Saint Realm would not make an appearance.

“Be careful, and for the honor of our Wilderness Sword Sect, defeat this Ye Se!” the tall and sturdy middle-aged man said.

“Elder Li, you can rest easy.” Chen Feng said confidently. Soon after he appeared atop the Martial Arts Practice Field.

In merely an instant, Chen Feng and Ye Se were trading blows.

The power of these two was far stronger than the rest of the geniuses in the Gathering. As they fought, the activity was enormous and it attracted the gaze of everyone. Even Jian Wushuang looked over in this moment.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang watched the fierce battle between the two of them.

The two of them had already been fighting for some time. They had fought to a standstill, and Jian Wushuang had a definite understanding of their strength.

“Either of these two is much stronger than Mo Lingtian whom I killed. However, power has its limits, and even though their realization of some concepts are exceptionally high, neither of them has comprehended Origin.” Jian Wushuang said inwardly.

Origin was far greater than any high-end concept. In the entire Nanyang Continent, the amount of those who had grasped the Yin-Yang Void Realm’s Origin was incredibly scarce. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It seemed in the Ancestor’s Land, the first trial was to allow him to grasp the Origin of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

Even though Chen Feng and Ye Se could be considered first class geniuses in the Nanyang Continent, the distance between their grasping of the Origin still left them coming up short.

“Swordsman, my friend, what of Chen Feng’s strength? Are you sure you can face him?” Ling Han looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“I’ll kill him, I’m sure.” Jian Wushuang replied with indifference.

He spoke the truth.

At Peak of the Yang Void Realm Cultivation, but to still have not yet grasped Origin...even if it had been a month ago it wouldn’t have been hard for him to kill this Chen Feng. However, now that he had attained the level of Source Enlightenment, his power has increased exponentially. Killing him would be even easier.

“Eh?” Ling Han furrowed his brow and a smile revealed itself on his face.

At this moment, in the middle of the Martial Arts Practice Field, the battle had reached a fever pitch. There was the sound of a violent clash, and in the wake of it there was finally an outcome in this confrontation between the two of them. Ye Se’s face was pale as he stood there, and remnants of blood were on the corners of his mouth.

“Haha, Ye Se, your strength...is that all you’ve got?” Chen Feng stood tall and upright, as arrogant as he had seemed before in the void. He looked at Ye Se with a high and mighty air.

“Hmph, you got lucky.” Ye Se feigned anger as he snorted coldly, then turned and walked back towards the direction of the Daluo Heaven Sect.

“Senior Brother Ye Se.” Jun Yi stood up and came over, astonishment in his eyes, “How could you lose to Chen Feng? Your finishing blow obviously still hasn’t come to full fruition.”

“Don’t ask so many questions.” Ling Han immediately chided.

Jun Yi was startled, and his brow furrowed more deeply.

Ye Se glanced at Ling Han, who nodded, “Relax.”

Ye Se sat down and lightly let out a breath of air. He aimed his gaze at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Ling Han also looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman, my friend, you’re up!” Ling Han began to speak.

“I’m a man of my word, and I keep my promises!” Jian Wushuang stood up.

“Be careful, Chen Feng’s power isn’t so simple. Even though just then I didn’t do my utmost, I could sense that if I had it still wouldn’t be easy to defeat him.” Ye Se warned.

“I’m not you.” Jian Wushuang laughed insipidly, then strode towards the Martial Arts Practice Field.
