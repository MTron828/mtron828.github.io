“Humph!” Gu Qiong snorted.

A giant, three-meter-long axe appeared in his hand. The body of the axe was extremely wide, like a small hill. A might power surged out from his huge arm as he lashed out with the axe.

Boom!

It collided with the scarlet scythe, causing a violent clash. The strength of both of them erupted.

Gu Qiong was knocked back while Xue Guzi only took a step back.

“Oh?”

Xue Guzi stared at Gu Qiong with a flicker of surprise in his eyes, saying, “Nice, both of you are Copper-armored Demon Gods, but you’re stronger than your friend. Anyway, the result won’t change.”

He grinned before he dived forward. “Shua! Shua! Shua!” All that appeared in the sky was a few scarlet shadows. No one knew where Xue Guzi was.

Gu Qiong was astonished and said to himself, “So fast.”

“Gu Qiong, be careful, he is really fast.” Gu Jing warned his friend.

Just then, Xue Guzi appeared at his opponent’s side. A cold blood light flashed toward the latter’s head.

Gu Qiong immediately wielded his giant axe to resist it, but the blood light suddenly changed its trajectory when it was about to crash into the axe. The odd swerve was out of the Demon God’s expectation.

Chi!

The blood light flashed through Gu Qiong’s chest, cutting off a piece of flesh.

“Bastard!” Gu Qiong snarled.

He furiously hacked at his opponent’s head with his axe while Gu Jing gripped a sturdy Stone Staff and charged forward.

Xue Guzi shook his head and said, “You’re too slow.”

“Swish! Swish!”

The giant axe and Stone Staff both went through Xue Guzi but touched nothing.

A cold blood light suddenly appeared behind Gu Qiong. “Shua!” A huge knife mark appeared on Gu Qiong’s back, where blood spurted out. If Gu Qiong did not have such a powerful body, he would have been split in half.

Seeing what was happening, Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He mumbled to himself, “The Demon God Clan is famous for their bodies and for having terrifying offensive and defensive powers, but their speed is their disadvantage.”

Gu Qiong was almost as strong as an ordinary superior Divine Realm expert in offensive power if he exerted his full strength, but his speed was only comparable to an advanced Divine Realm expert.

However, Xue Guzi...

He was proficient in speed, so he moved and attacked faster than the two Demon Gods.

Xue Guzi took the advantage of his speed to play with his opponents. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Gu Yan, who is good at close combat, might be able to defeat Xue Guzi with ease, but it’s impossible for these two Copper-armored Demon Gods to fight him. They’ll be killed without a doubt.

“It seems that I should show my move.”

Jian Wushuang licked his lips.

If it were a disciple from another sect who was fighting Gu Qiong, Jian Wushuang might have hesitated to join the battle, but things became different when it was a disciple from Cloud Sea Asgard.

It was clear to Jian Wushuang that three superior Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard had come for him, so he would not wait until they attacked him to fight.

It was good to take the initiative in a fight.

The Emperor Sword appeared in his hand. The next moment, he glided forward.

Xue Guzi was brandishing the scarlet scythe while playing with his opponents, who had received more cuts on their bodies.

“The Demon God’s bodies are powerful. They’re still alive under my attack, and their strength hasn’t weakened.”

Xue Guzi frowned. His offensive power was not strong enough to kill his opponents with a single strike, but he was able to injure them by using his speed.

Xue Guzi thought,?“Anyway, it will just take me more time.”

And then... Swoosh!

A figure unexpectedly appeared beside him.

“Huh?”

Xue Guzi instantly perceived it. After parrying the attacks from the two Demon Gods, he turned his head to look and found a black-robed youth staring at him coldly.

“Is that... Jian Wushuang?”?Xue Guzi was astonished.

His main purpose in coming here was to kill Jian Wushuang. However, he and the other disciples from Cloud Sea Asgard had not encountered the boy over the past seven days.

With there being only three days left, he had been upset about it. But now, Jian Wushuang unexpectedly appeared in front of him.

”?Does the boy want to grab my prey??” Xue Guzi frowned and saw a killing intent flash through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“No, his target is not the Demon Gods, but me.

“He already knows that Cloud Sea Asgard wants to kill him?”

Xue Guzi understood and then sneered while thinking,?“Even knowing that, instead of hiding, he’s come to kill me? Haha, he is courting death!”

“Boy, since you want to die, I’ll grant your wish.”

So much mighty killing intent gushed out from his eyes that it almost materialized.

Xue Guzi charged toward Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, go to hell!” Xue Guzi snarled.

His scarlet scythe, which was covered by a bloody mist, flashed through the sky.

Xue Guzi used his full strength to display his strongest move!

He hacked at Jian Wushuang’s head.
