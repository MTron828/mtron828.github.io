Chapter 1846: Massacre In The Past (Part 1)

Just as the entire Sanctuary Alliance and the entire Eternal Chaotic World were shaken by Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang received the news himself.

“Thirtieth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list? Isn’t it above the Master of Star Palace then?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose.

Besides, Hall Master Yuan sent him the mirror image of the fight in Deluge Fortress.

“The image only started after the formation around Deluge Fortress was broken. There isn’t any record of me using River Mountain Map,” Jian Wushang beamed with joy.

Mountain River Map was one of his trump cards. It was naturally best to expose it if possible.

In actual fact, it was because he had used River Mountain Map as a welcome gift and broken the formation outside Deluge Fortress that stirred a commotion. When the nearby experts recorded a mirror image, they naturally couldn’t record the scene where Jian Wushuang had performed River Mountain Map.

“This is fortunate. Although I revealed many techniques in this fight, there are still many trump cards that have yet to be exposed,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

No one knew that he had held back during the fight. He had yet to fight all-out.

He didn’t expose all of his trump cards either.

Like the Dao soldiers, he had merely used four silver-armored Dao soldiers. He had never used even one of the one hundred bronze-armored Dao soldiers.

Plus, his sword servant whose fighting power was above him, Jian Yi, had never fought either.

He continued to keep many trump cards for Lineage of Star.

“Now my ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list is higher than the Master of Star Palace and my bad name is well known. With my bad name, even if the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death spreads, various forces who wanted to pound Lineage of Star will have to think twice,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Regardless of the outcome of the fight or the deterrent force of the fight, Jian Wushuang was happy with it.

As the thirteen Almighties in Deluge Fortress had been killed, the remaining solo experts who harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star were few. Either they seeked refuge in greater forces or they hid at the border of Eternal Chaotic World. Even Vientiane Tower couldn’t find them.

Jian Wushuang could do nothing about it. Hence, he could only return to Lineage of Star first.

…

In Lineage of Star, in the vast void.

Jian Wushuang sat on the far highest throne while Hall Master Yuan, Gu Xin and Nie Yun sat below.

The three Hall Masters were looking at Jian Wushuang with their eyes filled with reverence.

In the past dozens of years, Jian Wushuang had stirred a massacre storm in Eternal Chaotic World with his strong power and ferocious measure. He had killed many solo experts who harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star. His bad name had served as a deterrent to Eternal Chaotic World.

Then, he was listed on the thirtieth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. With such power and outstanding achievements, the third Hall Masters naturally respected him from the bottom of their hearts.

“Hall Master Yuan, previously when I invited Emperor God Liu Guang to Deluge Fortress, Emperor God Liu Guang told me on the way that Sanctuary Alliance’s higher-ups once had an agreement with the Master of Star Palace many years ago. The Master of Star Palace’s action was restricted for the past years. He couldn’t massacre with Secret Skill of Star Palace. What’s with this matter?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and asked.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun looked at Hall Master Yuan too.

Hall Master Yuan was Universe Galaxy weapon spirit. He took care of many things in Lineage of Star and he knew the most about the Master of Star Palace.

“It is true,” Hall Master Yuan nodded and started explaining the ins and outs. “It happened many years ago. Back then, the Master of Star Palace just obtained the Secret Skill of Star Palace in Ancient Mystery Land. After he obtained it, he didn’t announce the secret skill to the public.

“In the end… when Lineage of Star fought with a major force, the Master of Star Palace had no choice but to take action. He fought with a Peak Emperor God from the other party. In the beginning, Palace Master was no match for him. He had no choice but to perform Secret Skill of Star Palace and killed the Peak Emperor God in the end!”

“The moment the news spread, Alliance Sanctuary shook and many forces, including many solo experts. There were one or two Great Emperors among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance who were interested in Secret Skill of Star Palace in the Master of Star Palace’s hand. Of course, the Great Emperors who were high above didn’t force the Master of Star Palace personally but experts of the other forces have no scruples.”

“Hence, a large number of experts came to threaten and cajole. In short, they wanted Palace Master to hand out the Secret Skill of Star Palace.”

“However, Master Palace got Secret Skill of Star Palace from Seven Star Realm. The secret skill couldn’t be passed on but could only be inherited in Scripture Depository. Those experts from Sanctuary Alliance wanted the Master of Star Palace to hand out Secret Skill of Star Palace. In other words, it is to hand out the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace. Then, Lineage of Star wouldn’t be able to cultivate this secret skill. Why would the Master of Star Palace be willing to?”

Then, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Secret Skill of Star Palace could only be inherited in Scripture Depository and couldn’t be passed on?

However, Jian Wushuang remembered that when he had received the secret skill in Green Fire World back then, he hadn’t received the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace but he had passed the test of Star Foggy Sea. Then, Lord Spirit Sound who controlled Star Foggy Sea had given him a token.

In the token, there was the complete Secret Skill of Star Palace.

If Secret Skill of Star palace couldn’t be passed on and could only be inherited, how could he explain the token?

“Not only the token that contained Secret Skill of Star Palace, but also Star Foggy Sea. It appeared in Green Fire World and it isn’t ordinary,” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted.

Green Fire World was totally sealed off from the outside world. How did Star Foggy World appear in Green Fire World?

And… Lord Spirit Sound.

Lord Spirit Sound, who controlled Star Foggy Sea. After Jian Wushuang took control of Star Foggy Sea, she had disappeared. Jian Wushuang didn’t know where she went too.

There were many situations that Jian Wushuang didn’t understand.

It was a pity that he didn’t think of it back then. The Master of Star Palace had already passed away and he couldn’t ask.

“Then?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“Then… the Master of Star Palace had no choice but to massacre,” Hall Master Yuan said, “Back then, Palace Master also has the fighting power of a Peak Emperor God and he cultivated the second volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace. When he performed with all his strength, his fighting power had already reached the level of a Great Emperor. A Great Emperor carrying out a massacre is a disaster!”

“Most importantly, when Palace Master wandered in Seven Star Realm back then, he absorbed a drop of blood essence by chance.”

“Blood essence?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“That was blood essence left behind by a top expert in Seven Star Black Sect and the blood essence was combined with a terrifying Power of Star…”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
