Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

Cultivators and Universe Gods outside the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle started at the the sight of the figure rising from the hole, standing without a word for a long time.

This was definitely the most unforgettable day for those Universe Gods!

They had witnessed the most horrible God Test ever in the Eternal Chaotic World!

And they also had witnessed the success of an unprecedented genius!

Right now the genius was in front of them.

In the eyes of all, Jian Wushuang fully recovered all his injuries and smiled to all those who were watching him.

Whiz!

A streak of scarlet light gushed from the earth and flashed toward Jian Wushuang.

And the light transformed into a Thousand-foot Moon Gazer.

“Hi my bro!” King of Venomous Worms nodded, looking at Jian Wushuang excitedly with his scarlet eyes.

“It’s good to see you again.” Jian Wushuang smiled to King of Venomous Worms.

“You too.” King of Venomous Worms nodded.

“Come back into my body. I now feel uncomfortable when I am without you.”

So King of Venomous Worms nodded and transformed into a streak of scarlet light and got into Jian Wushuang’s body.

King of Venomous Worms clearly felt the difference when he entered into Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Quite a big change!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You must be powerful at this level.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang nodded, “I feel that I am much more powerful than I was. But to what extent? I should have a try and find out.

“Then have a try?” King of Venomous Worms felt confused.

Jian Wushuang headed to the crowd.

Master of the Dayu Palace, Lord Wu Cang and Scarlet Island Master came to welcome him.

“Good job, Jian Wushuang!” Master of the Dayu Palace expressed his admiration.

The words of Master of the Dayu Palace surprised others.

After all, the privileged master seldom expressed his admiration to someone in the public.

But the power and the resilience of Jian Wushuang was indeed worth his admiration.

Lord Wu Cang also asked Jian Wushuang, “How about having a talk together?”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Then Jian Wushuang looked at those from the Scarlet Island.

“Congratulations!”

Scarlet Island Master expressed his congratulations after staring at Jian Wushuang for a while.

Jian Wushuang was very happy when he heard the word.

It was really a delightful moment.

“Congratulations!”

“Congratulations!”

Many Universe Gods, whether they had made acquaintance with Jian Wushuang, all congratulated him. Some talked to Jian Wushuang humbly, and even felt frightened.

After all, even though they were Universe Gods from the second heaven, they couldn’t survive such a horrible God Test.

And Jian Wushuang had impressed them with his power and skills.

After saying thanks and talking with the others, Jian Wushuang suddenly looked toward one direction.

It was where the crowd from the Holy Prefecture were standing.

They felt nervous when Jian Wushuang looked at them. Especially Universe God Jiu Hai, who had mixed feelings.

He had believed that Jian Wushuang would die in the God Test.

And the God Test had indeed caused great difficulties to Jian Wushuang.

But unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang survived!

And now, Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough and become Universe God of the First Heaven, which made it more difficult for Universe God Jiu Hai to take revenge.

“Universe God Jiu Hai” Jian Wushuang said.

Universe God Jiu Hai looked at Jian Wushuang, “OK, You are lucky this time!”

“You are right, or I will die many times.” Jian Wushuang continued, “Very soon I will be leaving the Dayu Universe.”

“Leaving?” Universe God Jiu Hai frowned.

Other Universe Gods around them were not surprised to hear so.

For geniuses like Jian Wushuang, staying in the Dayu Universe would be a waste for their talents. Jian Wushuang could only unleash his potential in more prestigious places like the Snow Dojo or the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

“What do you mean?” Universe God Jiu Hai looked at Jian Wushuang indifferently.

“I mean if you are going to take revenge for your disciples, don’t lose the opportunity while I am here.”

“Do you think I will let you get away?” Universe God Jiu Hai said.

“Definitely not.” Jian Wushuang continued, “That’s why I will give you an opportunity to kill me. How about today? You can do whatever you want to kill me, without any intervention by talents from the Scarlet Island. And I would also ask Master of the Dayu Palace not to stop you.

What Jian Wushuang said stirred a strong response in the crowd.

“What?”

Universe Gods from the Scarlet Island frowned.

“Do you mean you are going to fight with me individually?”

“Exactly.” Jian Wushuang nodded smilingly, “That’s the only opportunity you have to take revenge for your deceased disciples.”

Universe God Jiu Hai felt nervous and hesitated.

Other Universe Gods were quite interested in how Universe God Jiu Hai replied.
