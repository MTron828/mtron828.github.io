Chapter 1189: Jian Wushuang Strikes!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang could not help but be awestruck.

It was obvious that the Samsara Temple Master had held back by a lot during their friendly duel. Now, he was showing his true strength.

The Red Snow King was of peak Universe Master strength, but the disparity in terms of strength between himself and the Samsara Temple Master was very obvious; he was knocked backward in an instant.

“The Samsara Temple Master’s armor is definitely not anything ordinary. I guess it’s about as powerful as your Blood-killing Plate Armor. Furthermore, he’s a Universe Master, and could bring out more of his armor’s power as compared to you,” said the Gu King.

Jian Wushuang was extremely clear.

He could only utilize the first stage of his Blood-killing Plate Armor’s power; it had a total of three stages.

The Samsara Temple Master could naturally draw out more power from his own armor than Jian Wushuang.

While the Samsara Temple Master was engaging the Red Snow King,?the other Universe Masters and Puppet Fighters of the Green Fire Palace had all found their own opponents.

In addition, Red Lotus, who remained at the extreme perimeter of the battlefield, had also struck.

“I’m unleashing the Skill of the Jiu You Realms!” she said.

The accessory on her arm instantly gave off a blood-red glow and a huge blood colored river came gushing out.

It surged toward the surrounding with great force, covering the entire battlefield in an instant.

The Jin Kingdom experts were soon all caught in its flow, their expressions changing.

“Pressure!” Red Lotus growled.

She released the terrible power of the river onto her opponents, and it came onto them with huge force.

The fearsome pressure caused the weaker Holy Masters in the Jin Kingdom’s camp to give off terrible cries as their torsos were ripped apart from the force.

Even those Holy Masters amongst them who were somewhat stronger were on the verge of collapsing and in danger of being pounded into mush.

“It’s a Realm!”

“Be careful!”

All of the Universe Masters from the Gold Kingdom wore serious expressions on their faces. Even experts at their level would have their strength reduced by nearly 20 percent if they were caught in the river flow.

“Such a strong realm,”?thought Jian Wushuang secretly.

“In terms of power, I’m afraid Red Lotus’ Skill of the Jiu You Realms is even stronger than the Blaze Quicksand Gourd I obtained before,”?he thought.

“Hmm, the power of her Jiu You Realms Skill is indeed not bad, but it’s still weaker than that of the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. You feel this way because you were too weak to properly unleash the Gourd’s true power.” The Gu King’s voice rang out.

“Putting you aside, I suspect that even most of the Green Fire Palace Masters can unleash its full power. It’s also due to this reason that they would rather use other treasures and leave the Gourd at the Fire Point Exchange Office.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang asked, feeling enlightened.

All of a sudden… On the battlefield, a green haze began spreading. It formed a huge realm, thereby competing with the bloody river. Even though it was losing the battle, the Jin Kingdom experts were less tied down with its aid.

“Could it be that there are realm Realm Treasures in the Jin Kingdom as well? Also, it seems that they are treasures of high value?”?thought Jian Wushuang. He could follow this line of thought, but he also felt his emotions stirring.

The Green Fire Palace possessed far more treasures than the Jin Kingdom due to its far longer existence in the battlefield. That said, the latter had arrived on the battlefield five million years ago, and as such, its experts would not surprisingly have obtained Realm Treasures.

“To think that you people from the Green Fire Palace have even utilized your Universe Master-level Puppet Fighters. Seems like you guys are hell-bent on destroying the foundations our Jin Kingdom has laid on this battlefield, regardless of the consequences!” the Red Snow King said in an icy tone as he held his spear in one hand, countless blood red snowflakes falling behind him.

“Humph. Don’t any of you from the Jin Kingdom think of escaping today!” the Samsara Temple Master said, his booming voice projecting out from his black armor.

As he spoke, he was already flying out toward his enemies.

“You wish to subdue all of us with only such strength? What a joke,” scoffed the Red Snow King; he was feeling entirely unafraid.

In terms of battle strength of their Universe Masters, the Green Fire Palace was indeed much stronger than the Jin Kingdom, and the former did indeed have a great advantage over its opponents with the aid of the Jiu You Realm. That said, it was merely an advantage, and it was indeed still wishful thinking on the Samsara Temple Master’s part for his side to be able to completely wipe out the experts of the Jin Kingdom.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, who had remained concealed all this while, was prepared to strike.

“I need to secure victory for us the moment I strike!”?he thought.

“I need to kill one or more Universe Masters from the Jin Kingdom instantly before they even have time to react!”

Jian Wushuang licked his lips and fixed his icy stare on one area of the unfolding battle.

Two Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom were gathered there. Jian Wushuang was extremely familiar with them—they were the Golden Rock King and the Heaven Illusion King.

Both of them had tried to assassinate him on the battlefield earlier.

“I shall attack these two,”?he thought.

There was a flash of killing intent in his gaze as his figure began slowly drifting toward their location.

Both the Golden Rock and Heaven Illusion Kings were joining forces in a battle against the Void Temple Master.

Amongst the other Green Fire Palace Masters, only the Samsara Temple Master’s battle strength was higher than that of the Void Temple Master. The latter was close to peak Universe Master-level, and both the Golden Rock and Heaven Illusion Kings could barely manage to hold him at bay even after joining forces; most of the time the Void Temple Master held the upper hand.

“Destroy!”

He was wielding two gold discs and one of them was colored white while the other black. He tossed both of them out at the same time. The discs collided with the Golden Rock and Heaven Illusion Kings. The former was the stronger of the two, but he still could not help continuously stumbling backward.

As for his comrade, the Heaven Illusion King, she literally flew backward from the impact.

Just then…

Om!

A chilling sword light was forming.

It was extremely dazzling, and it affected the surrounding spacetime as it shot out. Instantly, it appeared before the Golden Rock King.

“Be careful, Golden Rock King!” the Heaven Illusion King roared in surprise from a distance away.

“What?” the Golden Rock King asked, his expression changing drastically.

The sword light was too fast and caught him by surprise. As such, he did not have any time to react.

“Who could have unleashed such a swift sword light?

“The Sunrise Sword Emperor?

“No, he was on another part of the battlefield, and could not have suddenly appeared here. Who was it then?

“Could there still be experts from the Green Fire Palace concealed in this battlefield?”?the Golden Rock King’s mind was racing.

His body, however, did not have enough time to react, and he could only stare at the sword light coming towards his head.

Chi!

The sword light shot past. The Golden Rock King’s head instantly detached from his neck and flew a distance away.

The first casualty who was of Universe Master-level was the Golden Rock King!
