Chapter 5580 ¬†Appearing

Under the care of the old monk, Moluo had a relatively decent childhood.

At the age of twelve, the old monk went out to beg for alms and never returned.

After achieving enlightenment, Moluo tried to trace the old monk's whereabouts, but to no avail.

At that time, Moluo was very young, and within the stone temple, there wasn't even a decent bowl. He had to rely on the skills his mother had left him.

A beggar!

As he begged along the way, he searched everywhere for information about the old monk.

It was during this time that he encountered the benefactor who set him on the path of cultivation for the first time.

The princess of the Moluo Kingdom in the mundane world.

Although she belonged to a mortal dynasty, the princess was an outer disciple of a cultivation sect.

It was because of that princess that Moluo came to be called Moluo.

He remembered that when he met her, he hadn't eaten for three days, and when he was about to faint from hunger on the road, he encountered the princess.

Although he was somewhat delirious from hunger at that time, he remembered her appearance for a lifetime.

Speaking up to this point, Moluo's eyes held reminiscence and a hint of sadness.

The grace of a single meal!

He still couldn't forget that bowl of rice from back then!

It was because of that meal that he not only embarked on the path of demonic cultivation but also led the Moluo Kingdom from a mundane mortal dynasty to the cultivation world. It then became a peak force, a top power in the Earth Realm.

Unfortunately, the princess had long departed.

Jian Wushuang, after listening, also understood.

No wonder the Moluo Kingdom's royal family had such a weak foundation, yet they could retain this elder. It turned out emotions had been at play, gratitude and repaying a kindness!

From a commoner to the supreme-peak!

This journey, even Jian Wushuang found it unbelievable.

Once a beggar who couldn't afford a meal, now stepping into the path of cultivation!

Now, he understood why Moluo said he was wrong.

Although the Earth Realm was chaotic with the dominance of the demonic path, the fact that even a beggar could embark on the path of cultivation indicated that the threshold for the lower class was not high. At least in terms of bloodline, there were almost no barriers.

As long as you have the aptitude for cultivation, you can tread this path.

Compared to the secret realms in the Human Realm, the Earth Realm is a paradise.

Those wandering cultivators in the Human Realm, relying on their own exploration, face numerous difficulties in reaching this stage. If they enter ancient forces like Sealgate Mountain, they might soar to new heights.

However, it was unfortunate that they were hindered by their backgrounds.

This was a significant loss.

As Jian Wushuang, who was expected to become the successor of Qishen Temple in the future, he couldn't just watch this happen; he had to make a change.

On the arena.

The one called Xin Jiu had already been defeated; there were not many miraculous reversals, the difference in strength was too great.

Similar to how the Emperor slaughtered the Yan Immortals.

The Sealgate Mountain disciple who disguised himself as a wandering cultivator not only defeated Xin Jiu but also crippled his cultivation.

It was an utter annihilation.

With the help of the other wandering cultivators, Xin Jiu struggled to stand up. Watching the ten individuals who successfully entered Sealgate Mountain on the arena, his fear and reluctance were palpable.

After bitter cultivation, crossing mountains and valleys for decades, now he stood at the doorstep.

"Brother Xin Jiu, don't be too sad. With your talent, even if you can't enter Sealgate Mountain, you can still join other weaker sects. Your future is boundless!" someone comforted.

However, Xin Jiu knew himself; his cultivation was crippled, and there was no hope.

Unlike the despondent exit of these wandering cultivators, the situation was unchanged for the family disciples.

Even if they didn't enter Sealgate Mountain, their cultivation remained intact, and they could try joining other sects.

As for the wandering cultivators, crossing the range of one sect to reach another was simply a fantasy.

In the vast mountains and rivers, demonic beasts roamed freely, and reaching Sealgate Mountain was already considered quite impressive.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang could no longer bear to watch and revealed his figure directly.

The people below instantly sensed a terrifying aura, standing over them like the sun itself.

Jian Wushuang and Moluo floated in mid-air, their gazes coldly fixed on the people below.

The elders of those clans, having seen much in their lives, recognized the extraordinary nature of the newcomers‚ÄîImmortals, undoubtedly. Hastily, they respectfully paid their respects.

"We pay our respects, Immortal above!"

Even the wandering cultivators realized the situation and bowed in reverence.

Jian Wushuang showed no favor to the younger generation of the clans, landing directly among the wandering cultivators, leaving the clan's powerful figures puzzled.

The younger ones were unaware, but the powerful figures of the clans were well aware of the rules of this world.

Those who could attain the status of Immortals were either from prominent families or large forces, and they wouldn't bother with wandering cultivators.

However, Jian Wushuang paid no attention to these individuals and walked straight towards Xin Jiu!

A strand of Life power transformed into All Things, converging into Xin Jiu's body.

Buzz!

An aura erupted from within Xin Jiu in an instant, and several cultivators who were assisting him were directly shaken back several steps.

Xin Jiu, previously heavily injured and disabled, made a complete recovery. Not only did his cultivation recover, but his strength also skyrocketed.

And it happened in an instant.

The younger generation of the clans found the scene shocking; Xin Jiu's aura had surpassed even the formidable figures within their own clans.

On the arena!

The disciple of Sealgate Mountain who had previously defeated Xin Jiu had a slight change in expression.

His task was originally to cripple these wandering cultivators sent by the sect, but unexpectedly, the situation had taken a turn for the better for the other party!

Jealousy surged for a moment.

Xin Jiu, on the other hand, was very excited. It was his first time encountering an Immortal. He didn't expect the other party to help him restore his strength and even assist in advancing his cultivation. Now, he could barely control his own power.

According to the hierarchy rules of the Human Realm, he was now in the Law Domain realm!

Immediately, he knelt down, respectfully saying, "Thank you, Immortal!"

Jian Wushuang revealed a faint smile, turning to Moluo and said, "His potential is good. Help me take him as a disciple!"

"Yes!" Moluo was somewhat surprised. He knew Jian Wushuang disapproved of what the Human Realm did, but he didn't expect that he would take a mortal disciple at the first attempt.

However, the other's potential was indeed considerable. Even in the Earth Realm, without a background, he could still tread the path of Immortality. With Jian Wushuang's guidance, becoming an Emperor was not difficult!

Hearing that someone wanted to take him as a disciple, Xin Jiu was first stunned, then reacted, turning towards Moluo and kowtowing heavily three times.

Moluo looked at him with some joy. This young man with dark skin and short hair had a character similar to his own‚Äîa determined spirit. Taking him in would be a good choice.

On the side, Jian Wushuang watched the other's joy but sighed inwardly.

Giving a fish was not as good as teaching how to fish!

This principle was understood, but truly implementing it was extremely difficult.

To bring about change, he needed to stir up chaos in the Human Secret Realm. If he did that, even the Divine Temple might have to intervene.

So, he needed to come up with a strategy.

To build a peak power! Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

This was the Human Realm.

Acting recklessly would be inappropriate. Instead, it might offend all the forces in the entire Human Realm. Offending these people would make it impossible to help the low-level loose cultivators, even if he wanted to.
