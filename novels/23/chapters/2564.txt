Chapter 2565: Established Sword World

Jian Wushuang journeyed the world alone with a sword in his hand during which he constantly honed his swordsmanship.

Through hard practices and repeated fights with the bandits, he gained breadth and depth of sword principles knowledge as he continued innovating his Space-time and Transmigration sword techniques.

Time quickly flew past.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had been wandering in the Dark Thunder Territory for a year and three months.

He finally made a pit stop.

On a snow-covered mountain top, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with his eyes slightly closed.

In his mind, he recalled the many things he felt during the nine-day battle with the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor. The perfect Sword World was different from the one Jian Wushuang knew.

Jian Wushuang also recalled the many sword principle insights left by the Purple Blood Saint specifically the introduction part about the Sword World.

In the end, Jian Wushuang reminisced about his journey for the past one year and three months as well as the events he encountered in Dark Thunder Territory such as the bandits who looted and fought wildly. Life seemed to be fragile yet so tenacious.

He saw a Peak Divine Demon Realm cultivator who submitted to a bandit to survive.

She just wanted to live.

“The world, life...”

Jian Wushuang murmured under his breath as he set his heart and mind to achieve the enlightenment of all beings.

“Ah, I get it! I finally know what’s missing—life!

“A complete world isn’t about its frame or outlook. Its core value lies in the life within!

“The purpose of a world from birth to evolution is the development of life and living beings. Even the world itself is a form of life!

“From formation to demise, the process is equivalent to birth, aging, sickness, and death of a person. All of which are stages of life.

“I’ve never been able to establish my Sword World because I’ve always seen it as a world without life. Although I’ve understood all kinds of esotericism, I lacked an understanding of life...

“The evolution of the world is the evolution of life!”

In search of enlightenment, Jian Wushuang was truly delighted by what unfolded for him.

He remained seated on the top of the mountain, but a smile slowly began to spread on his face. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and began to open up his Sword World inside his body.

A weak sword intent grew in his body like a germinating seed. It began to take root and sprout before slowly spreading through continuous evolution. It did not take long for a small complete Sword World to open up in his body.

“The Sword World is done!” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised.

He had long achieved the conditions for opening up the Sword World and the only part lacking was an understanding of life.

The process became easier the moment he had broken through the bottleneck and attained enlightenment.

However, he had only established a prototype of the Sword World as it was small and needed continuous improvement.

“The sword principle knowledge Purple Blood Saint left mentioned that the Sword World’s power is determined by the cultivator. The larger the Sword World the more stable it is and the stronger its power. I’ll have to work on improving it.”

The Sword World within Jian Wushuang’s body which was filled with endless sword intent began its rapid expansion.

It was originally a small and weak world, but expanded rapidly to tens, hundreds, and up to thousands of miles!

However, it was contained within his body no matter how it spread. It was nothing like the world outside.

In a very brief moment, the Sword World in Jian Wushuang’s body had spread to 10,000 miles.

“This ten thousand miles of Sword World should be what’s normal among many sword principle cultivators. Many cultivators are only at this level, but it’s still far from my limit. Let’s continue!” Jian Wushuang continued expanding his Sword World.

He did not meet any hindrance.

It grew from 10,000 to 20,000 and soon reached 30,000 miles.

Shortly after, his Sword World expanded to 50,000 miles and it was still rapidly expanding.

“Fifty thousand miles of Sword World is considered formidable among sword principle cultivators, but it isn’t considered top-rated. Some powerful sword principle experts can establish up to eighty or even ninety thousand miles of Sword World. At that level, the Sword World established would be highly destructive, It shouldn’t be difficult for me to reach that level as well.”

Jian Wushuang was confident of establishing a Sword World ranging from 80,000 to 90,000 miles.

True to his expectations, it quickly grew to 90,000 miles as his Sword World continued to expand. However, that was not the end as it continued to grow at an astounding speed.

91,000, 92,000... 95,000 and up till 99,999 miles!

“Nine is the number of Heaven and Earth. Ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine miles is the end of what a Sword World could achieve. It’s the ultimate achievement for any Principle World!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The Purple Blood Saint mentioned this in his insight records.

A Principle World of 90,000 miles was scarce in the entire Ancient God Domain like a hen’s teeth.

Having reached 99,999 miles was the extreme level one could achieve. It was considered perfect and perhaps only two to three had ever achieved such in the entire Ancient God Domain at any time.

Purple Blood Saint was well-traveled in his lifetime and had never met someone who perfected their Principle World.

Purple Blood Saint deemed it was seemingly impossible for a Principle World to go beyond 99,999 miles.

Nonetheless, his Sword World continued to expand for one last mile right after Jian Wushuang’s 99,999 miles achievement before it finally came to a stop!

100,000 miles!

Jian Wushuang’s Sword World ended at 100,000 miles!

It was one mile more than 99,999 miles.

One should not belittle that one mile as if 99,999 miles was the heavenly ultimate level then Jian Wushuang’s level was beyond that ultimate level. That one mile marked the completion of his Sword World.

That was truly a perfect Sword World!

Much better than the ultimate 99,999 miles level.

“One hundred thousand miles. A perfect Sword World indeed.”

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes with a hint of surprise and joy within it.
