With a tinge of excitement, Jian Wushuang started to check the Qian Kun ring that Bei Xiu had left behind.

In his Qian Kun ring, there were various treasures. Many were priceless. Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“I’m impressed. Although I am a disciple of Star Palace, forgetting the few unique treasures like Mountain River Map, Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Mountain Sword, I can’t compare to Bei Xiu,” Jian Wushuang gasped in silence. Very soon, he was attracted by the twenty crystals in the Qian Kun ring.

“Tian Ling crystal, so many of them?”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

One would only be able to get it by hunting beasts that were rank three and above in the deserted region. There was a total of twenty pieces of Desolate Crystal, which were extremely precious in Tian Ling land, in Bei Xiu’s Qian Kun ring.

Jian Wushuang’s Disciple Task was to only collect ten Tian Ling crystals.

Thus, he completed his task in this instance. He even had ten extra Tian Ling crystals.

“We’re both Peak three-starred Soul Masters but it’s totally different when one has background experience and when one doesn’t,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He already inspected the other two Peak three-starred Soul Masters’ Qian Kun ring. However, the treasures in the two rings didn’t value one-tenth of Bei Xiu’s.

“Mm, this is…”

Jian Wushuang was suddenly attracted by a wooden slip book that gave out unique energy in the Qian Kun ring.

He could feel the uniqueness of the wooden slip book.

“I wonder what this wooden slip book contains,” Jian Wushuang covered it with his Soul Power immediately.

At the very next moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were wide-open.

“How… how could this be?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked by the contents of the wooden slip book.

It was a secret skill!

If it were to be any ordinary secret skill, or a secret skill that was famous in Tian Ling land, he wouldn’t be shocked.

Hence, he only reacted that way because the secret skill was… Eighteen Asura Hell!

“It is the strongest consciousness attack secret skill created by the top expert in Tian Ling land, Real God Demonic Rain.”

“It was with Bei Xiu?”

Jian Wushuang stared in disbelief.

He had heard Feng Tao mention the Real God Demonic Rain before.

Real God Demonic Rain started Soul Master Temple and, at the same time, created Soul Island. Her existence on Tian Ling land was definitely God-like.

The strongest secret skill, Eighteen Asura Hell that she had created was extremely famous too.

However, because Real God Demonic Rain was too aloof, many powerful Real Gods in Soul Island were not qualified to meet Real God Demonic Rain even once. As for the strongest consciousness attack secret skill created by Real God Demonic Rain, almost no one had seen it before.

But then, Jian Wushuang found the secret skill left in Bei Xiu’s Qian Kun ring and it was a complete one.

“Bei Xiu was famous in Soul Island and everyone knew that he possessed a strong background, but no one knew what sort of background he had. He only knew that Real Gods in Soul Island were polite to him!”

“Before he died, he spoke about his mother. Would it be… would his mother be Real God Demonic Rain?”

Then, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but gasp.

Actually, judging from the situation where Bei Xiu possessed Eighteen Asura Hell, his mother was most likely Real God Demonic Rain.

“No wonder he could recognize my Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack!”

“Real God Demonic Rain has been outside of Tian Ling land, which meant that she had wandered in the Eternal Chaotic World before. With her power, she was naturally qualified to access Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. Bei Xiu was his son and it was normal that he found out about the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack from her.”

“Great, I killed the son of the top expert in Tian Ling land?”

Jian Wushuang sighed.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang, where are you?”

A message was transmitted.

Jian Wushuang stiffened and took out a token. It was the communication token connected with Feng Tao.

“Feng Tao?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He knew that Huo Yi had framed him and Feng Tao didn’t know anything about it.

When Bei Xiu was dealing with him, he had sent experts to take care of Feng Tao. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jian Wushuang stood there as he looked at the token in his hand. He sighed and suddenly exerted force in his palm.

Pak!

The communication token suddenly exploded.

“I killed Bei Xiu. Although there was no one who saw, if Real God Demonic Rain were to be angry and start to investigate, she might suspect me. Once I’m caught, I won’t stand a chance. In other words, Soul Island or even Tian Ling land is not safe for me.”

Jian Wushuang knew his situation clearly.

Hence, he didn’t reply Feng Tao and he even destroyed the communication token.

What he was doing was making people think that Bei Xiu, Huo Yi and the rest of them had disappeared from the deserted region altogether.

It would get the best result.

He didn’t belong in Tian Ling land. As there was no place for him anyway, he could just leave.

“I’ve been in Tian Ling Mystery Land for almost three hundred years, it’s time to return,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had come to Tian Ling Mystery Land for experience and train his Soul Attack.

Then, he was at the stage of great achievement for Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack and he had already reached his goal. Plus, he had already completed the task to collect ten Tian Ling crystals. Hence, there was nothing left for him in Tian Ling Mystery Land.

Jian Wushuang immediately tore the token for leaving mystery land.

The token broke and a space wormhole appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Goodbye Tian Ling land!”

Jian Wushuang chuckled. He took a leap into the wormhole without hesitation.

…

When there was a flash of light again, Jian Wushuang arrived on the island that Lineage of Star control.

There were still countless cultivators gathered there to wait for space wormhole to open.

After Jian Wushuang had arrived on the island, he immediately returned to Lineage of Star’s old lair.

In the resplendent Milky Way, there was Lineage of Star’s old lair.

Jian Wushuang saw Hall Master Yuan.

“Young man, how did it go in Tian Ling Mystery Land? Plain sailing?” Hall Master Yuan smiled and looked over.

“Quite well,” Jian Wushuang smiled and he took out the ten Tian Ling crystals, “The task that Hall Master Yuan assigned me has been completed.”

Hall Master Yuan looked at the ten Tian Ling Crystals and nodded, “These Tian Ling Crystals are very useful, especially for consciousness and Souls. You should keep them as you happen to need them.”

Jian Wushuang was touched but he didn’t reject.

The Tian Ling Crystals were really useful to him.

“Looking at you now, you have had a bountiful harvest during the years in Tian Ling Mystery Land, huh?” Hall Master Yuan looked.

Thinking about the gains made over the years, Jian Wushuang revealed a smile.
