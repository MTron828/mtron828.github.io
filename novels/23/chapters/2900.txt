Chapter 2901: Three Heaven-Sealing Paintings

——

“Jian Yi, I have high hopes for you. With your strength, as long as you break through to become an undying sage in the future, becoming a heaven-grade member is almost guaranteed. As for becoming an emperor-grade member, you also have a high chance of becoming one. Even the legendary primordial grade, which belongs to the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, you still have some hope.”

“For me, as long as you can become a heaven-level member, the reward given by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is probably more valuable than a heaven-sealing painting scroll. If you become an emperor-level member, I will get more benefits… because of this, I am willing to give you the heaven-sealing painting scroll. I only hope that you can accept the test of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance in the name of my recommendation,” The Bone Emperor said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

He also completely understood the Bone Emperor’s purpose.

To put it bluntly, this Bone Emperor was also for profit.

He valued his talent and believed that he could become a heaven-level member, or even an emperor-level member, or even a legendary original-level member in the future. Of course, by then, he would be able to obtain even greater benefits. That was why he was willing to take out the heaven-sealing painting scroll to borrow his name.

“Jian Yi, this is a piece of cake for you, but it’s very important to me. Are you willing to accept it?” The Bone Emperor looked at him.

“Okay, I’ll accept it.” Jian Wushuang nodded directly.

He did not hesitate at all, and there was indeed nothing to hesitate about.

It was just a name. It did not matter to him whether there was a referral or not. However, since the referral would benefit the Bone Emperor greatly and the Bone Emperor had offered the seal the heaven scroll as a reward, he would naturally give the Bone Emperor face.

Moreover, the seal the heaven scroll in the Bone Emperor’s hand promised him.

“Haha, that’s great!”

Seeing Jian Wushuang agree, the Bone Emperor immediately smiled. He waved his hand and immediately threw the ancient scroll toward Jian Wushuang.

“You’re giving me the scroll of heaven-sealing painting now. Aren’t you worried that I’ll go back on my word?” Jian Wushuang took the scroll and looked at the Bone Emperor in surprise.

“Of course not. I believe you won’t offend me for something that’s easy for you,” The Bone Emperor said with a cold laugh.

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Jian Yi, since you’ve received my seal the heaven painting scroll, the agreement between us will be fulfilled. But when will you accept the test of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The Bone Emperor asked.

“No rush.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “I have an even more important matter to deal with in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. I’ll go to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance after I’ve dealt with this matter and have a real result. There’s nothing to be reluctant about in the Golden Crow Nine Realms.”

“Well, as soon as possible. I can see that your aura is extremely powerful. It’s at the pinnacle of the Divine Master level. You’d better pass the Heaven-slaying Alliance’s test before you break through to the Immortal Saint level. It’ll be easier this way. If you pass the test after you break through to the Immortal Saint-level, your test will be even more difficult,” The Bone Emperor said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“This is my message token. When you decide to accept the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s test, send a message to me. I will arrange it for you,” The Bone Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang took the message token and nodded slightly. “Lord Bone Emperor, I wonder if the Heavenly Curve World…”

“Heavenly Curve World?” The Bone Emperor smiled strangely. “You killed the Lord of Heavenly Curve World. It’s your own ability to replace him. who dares to gossip in the Golden Crow Nine Realms?

“As for the agreement between me and the other forces, it only stipulates that masters and saints of one world are not allowed to enter other realms to participate in the competition. However, this agreement doesn’t restrict Divine Masters. Whatever you want to do is your business. I Won’t interfere,” The Bone Emperor said.

“In that case, thank you, Lord Bone Emperor,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully, then turned around and left.

After leaving the Bone Emperor Castle, Jian Wushuang did not leave the Bone Emperor Realm immediately. Instead, he found a remote place in the Bone Emperor Realm and opened an independent cave mansion.

In the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with excitement and anticipation in his eyes.

In front of him, three ancient scrolls that looked and had the same aura were floating quietly.

These three scrolls were all heaven-sealing scrolls!

“Bone Emperor knows that I once obtained a heaven-sealing scroll from Saint Crimson Rock, but he doesn’t know that I found the second heaven-sealing scroll a long time ago. In addition to the one he gave me, I now have three heaven-sealing scrolls in my hands!”

“Three!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

There were rumors about the heaven-sealing painting scroll in the absolute beginning divine realm. As long as he could gather three heaven-sealing painting scrolls at the same time, he would be able to obtain an extraordinary opportunity.

This rumor had always been just a rumor. No one knew whether it was true or not.

After all, the absolute beginning divine realm was too big, and there were only dozens of heaven-sealing painting scrolls. Moreover, they had been scattered a long time ago. They were scattered in every corner of every territory. It was impossible for others to find one, but it was difficult to find three at once.

However, Jian Wushuang had found them now. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t know whether the rumor is true or not. I hope it’s true, but I don’t know what kind of opportunity I can get from the three heaven-sealing painting scrolls,” Jian Wushuang murmured, on the other hand, he had already opened the three heaven-sealing paintings.

The three heaven-sealing paintings were exactly the same.

Not only did they look the same, but what was recorded in the paintings was also the same. It was a vast and boundless dark starry sky.

The dark starry sky contained endless mysteries of heaven and earth. For a long time, Jian Wushuang had relied on those mysteries to cultivate.

Now, as the three heaven-sealing scrolls were opened at the same time, a strange phenomenon immediately arose.

The three heaven-sealing scrolls emitted a bright light, which was extremely dazzling and contained an extremely ancient aura.

Jian Wushuang sat there with his legs crossed. He did not move, nor did he have any guidance. However, the three heaven-sealing scrolls in front of him had already begun to close up.

Soon, Jian Wushuang found that the three heaven-sealing painting scrolls were merging with each other!

Yes, merging.

Each of the three heaven-sealing painting scrolls was a vast and boundless dark void.

But now, the three heaven-sealing painting scrolls had naturally merged into a new painting scroll.

A strange power was immediately guided over.
