Beep~~~

The tide around Jian Wushuang suddenly dispersed before Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with a smile.

“Swordsman, you just...” Tai Shan and the others walked up to him right away.

“With a bit of luck, I made some small breakthrough in Sword Skill,” Jian Wushuang said. He seemed to be in a good mood.

But his words made the others unable to help sighing.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang was already incredibly powerful, but now he became even stronger.

Though it was only a small breakthrough in Sword Skill, it still implied that he had enhanced of his strength.

“I’m so jealous of you.” Mo Ying sighed, as he was stuck in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm for a long time.

Just then...

“Everybody, fall in!”

A voice thundered in the Void above the whole Heartless City, where the Master and the Protectors of the Heartless Sect hovered over at the top, with their powerful aura spreading all over the place. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The voice caused a stir in the whole city, and a large number of figures began to rush skyward.

The members of the ninth team all headed up.

“Something is wrong.” Tai Shan frowned. “Let’s get there quickly.”

The ten members of the team immediately rushed away.

In the Void there were assembled numerous experts, most of whom were in the Yin-Yang Void Realm because of them being able to step on air, and there were even thousands of experts floating therein.

Probably, the experts above the Yin Void Realm in the entire Heartless Sect have gathered around.

“All of you, follow me.”

The Master of Heartless Sect shouted and led the crowd out of the city.

Among the crowd, Jian Wushuang knit his brows slightly. ”?Not only his Excellency himself but also all the experts in the sect are here. It seems like they will have a life-and-death struggle with the Demons Island.”

Just as Jian Wushuang had expected, it didn’t take them long to get to a huge city, which used to belong to the Heartless Sect, but now a fierce fight had erupted there.

The two sides fighting were exactly the Heartless Sect and the Demons Island.

“Listen up, everyone tie a red cloth around your arm and kill every living thing that doesn’t have one.” The Master of Heartless Sect commanded.

The experts of the Heartless Sect immediately took out a red cloth and tied it around their arms.

“Begin, Kill!”

Eyes burning with anger, the experts of the Heartless Sect followed the order, rushing into the city.

When they arrived, the experts of the Demons Island who were impatiently waiting, swarmed at them quickly.

“Haha, you heartless old guy, watch how I raze your sect to the ground today!” yelled a well-built bareheaded man, standing at the top of the Void with a jet-black long staff in his hand. The Aura of the level of Half-saint spread out from him, which made him look like a War-god.

“Damn you baldie. Let’s see who will be the standing one at the end,” the Master of Heartless Sect said cruelly, dashing straight toward that bald man.

In a twinkling, the fight between the two Half-saint experts began.

The experts of the Heartless Sect and the Demons Island tangled together, and their battle-cries reached the heaven.

“Go to hell!”

“Slay them, fight!”

“Go to hell, bastards of Demons Island!”

The experts of the two forces fought fiercely, intensifying the battle instantly.

The Bloody Blade Team, which Jian Wushuang belonged to, was in an intense fight with a team of Demons Island about its equal.

“Go to hell!”

Hair matted and eyes bloodshot, a savage man appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, chopping toward him with a mountain-cutting broadsword.

A cold light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He stabbed toward the man at the speed beyond imagination, like a snake soundlessly attacking its prey. The Triple-kill Sword pierced through the man’s heart, leaving a large hole through it.

Swish!

A streak of blood-red light came over beside Jian Wushuang like a ghost. It was a black-robed woman, staring at Jian Wushuang coldly.

Jian Wushuang slashed at her backhanded. The woman was blasted away by the powerful force and died directly without any struggling.

Seeing that two people in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm died in Jian Wushuang’s hands in such a short while, the surrounding experts were all shocked and terrified.

“How could he be so powerful?”

“Who is he? It looks like that he could be comparable to the experts on the Bloodmoon List.”

“Haha, He is called Swordsman, the top fighter in our team.”

Jian Wushuang’s teammates were overexcited, while the others might be amazed or surprised.

“I’m so delighted. It’s been some time since I fought with such gratification,” said Mo Ying while fighting with an expert of the Demons Island. Suddenly, a long spear aimed at his back.

“What the hell?” Spotting the attack, Mo Ying’s expression changed. Just when he was about to avoid it, the owner of the spear was put down by Jian Wushuang behind him.

“Watch out, bro,” Jian Wushuang said to Mo Ying.

“Thanks!” Mo Ying raised his eyebrows before going on fighting.

Long Sword in hand, Jian Wushuang swept over the battlefield around him, slaughtering the experts of the Demons Island with ease and sometimes, lending his teammates a hand. The Triple-kill Sword also began to quiver frantically in the killing.

“Is the Triple-kill Sword going to have a breakthrough?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes twinkled with pleasure.

The Sword had restored to a magic weapon of a low second grade for a long time and helped him kill many experts afterwards, mostly because his father killed two experts in the Saint Realm with the sword and the saints’ blood supported its restoration.

After that, Jian Wushuang killed many experts himself with the sword, which leveled the sword up to its peak as a magic weapon of a low second grade. Now, signs showed that it was going to break through the peak.

“I should kill more to help the sword.”

Jian Wushuang laughed and shuttled through the throng like a ghost.

Puff! Puff! Puff!

As he moved, the experts of the Demons Island successively fell under his sword. He picked up the stronger ones to kill, and among the dead, the weakest were at the Initial Yang Void Realm while the most were at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

Actually, many experts on the battlefield had noticed his killing spree.

“Who is he? How could he be so strong?”

“It’s so easy for him to kill an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. He definitely should be on the Bloodmoon List.”

“I heard there are only seven Protectors in the Heartless Sect on the Bloodmoon List. When did it get one more?”

“Damn it! Since our seven Devils were busy fighting with the seven Protectors of the Heartless Sect, none of them is free to handle him.”
