Chapter 287: Sword Tide

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I never thought that Shen Tianyu was not killed by Wu Jiu at all.”

“Hum, I had been wondering about this for a long time. Shen Tianyu ranked much higher than Protector Wu Jiu on the Bloodmoon List, so naturally, he should be stronger than Wu Jiu. Back when they were in the Golden Wing City, Protector Wu Jiu and Protector Bei Mu together could only suppress Shen Tianyu. How could it be possible that Protector Wu Jiu killed Shen Tianyu all by himself? Now, it has turned out that the one who killed Shen Tianyu is Swordsman, not him!”

“Right, only a top expert, like Swordsman, could kill Shen Tianyu.”

“No wonder Wu Jiu would be so generous to treat us to the Skyheart wine. He contributed no efforts in killing Shen Tianyu, but he carried that corpse to get the reward.”

The surrounding experts of the Bloody Blade Team began to talk about Wu Jiu with disdain, and Jian Wushuang with worship, although they had been dismissive of Jian Wushuang earlier.

Like the law of the jungle, the law of this world was that whoever possessed the greatest strength was the king.

“Protector Wu Jiu, you should give me back Shen Tianyu’s body, shouldn’t you?” said Jian Wushuang, coldly staring at Wu Jiu.

“I...” At that time, Wu Jiu could not find a word to response.

“Doesn’t matter if you can’t. It took me and my bros of the ninth team much effort to kill Shen Tianyu. We don’t mind that you claimed the honor, but it will be too much for us if you want to keep the treasures awarded by his Excellency for yourself.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but suddenly he came close to Wu Jiu to talk to him in a low voice. “Wu Jiu, hand the treasures over and I’ll let what happened today be, or...”

Jian Wushuang stopped talking, but his strong killing intent showed what he wanted to say.

Wu Jiu looked pale, and unwillingness filled his eyes. But at this moment he was like a fish in Jian Wushuang’s net, and all he could do was to give Jian Wushuang everything the Master awarded no matter how unwilling he was.

“That’s more like it,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. Not even sparing a second glance for Wu Jiu, he turned back and walked up to the earthen jars of wine. He carried one jar on his shoulder and said, “Bros, Since Protector Wu Jiu wants to treat us to this wine, we’d better accept his kindness, shouldn’t we?”

“Wow! Wow! Wow!”

Shouts of joy resounded through the whole Martial Arts Practice Field, and many experts of the Bloody Blade Team came up for the wine and started enjoying drinking.

As for Wu Jiu, no one bothered to care about him anymore. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With one jar of Skyheart wine on his shoulder, Jian Wushuang went back to his manor with the others of the ninth team.

They gathered around a stone table, drinking, laughing, and talking.

“Haha, who would have thought that Wu Jiu’s expression when he was defeated by bro Swordsman would make me so delighted,” said Tai Shan, laughing out loud.

“Humph, Wu Jiu is always domineering. What a pleasure to see him fall down today,” said Mo Ying with a smile, “I heard he ordered others to keep this a secret when we left. Hahaha, how funny!”

Seeing that Wu Jiu was beaten and even humiliated by Jian Wushuang in front of others, every member of the ninth team felt more than happy.

All this was due to Wu Jiu’s bad character, and what he had done this time was bad enough for others to sneer at him. Before this, they could do nothing to him but swallow their anger, now with Jian Wushuang, things were different.

In the world where the strongest could lord it over all others, even though Jian Wushuang had defeated Wu Jiu and put him to shame, Wu Jiu could not do anything for revenge. Instead, he would have to be in awe of Jian Wushuang as he was much stronger than him.

“Captain Tai Shan, in this Interspatial Ring is the treasure awarded by his Excellency, please take it and share it with other bros.” Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring and handed it over to Tai Shan.

“Why do you give this to us?” Tai Shan frowned. “You killed Shen Tianyu all by yourself, and we have nothing to do with this honor. This ring...”

“There is nothing more than the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid in this ring, so take it easy. What’s more, Since all of you exerted your efforts, how can I keep it myself?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Haha, captain, Swordsman is not the kind of man who would care about Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. If he gives it to us, what we should do is to accept,” said Mo Ying, grinning.

Tai Shan smiled silently and refused no more. “Fine, we share it equally.”

“Good!”

The others of the ninth team began to allocate the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid in the ring with excitement.

Jian Wushuang did not join them. He left alone and walked to the center of the courtyard, sitting down with his leg crossed and his eyes closed. Meanwhile, the mist made of Sword Essence spread all throughout from his body.

Sword Fog...

“Haw-haw, it’s very generous of his Excellency to grant a reward of so much Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. No wonder Wu Jiu would treat us to Skyheart wine, cause compared with the Liquid he was awarded, the Skyheart wine was nothing,” Mo Ying said and laughed loud, but suddenly, he seemed to realize something and looked Jian Wushuang’s way.

“Swordsman is...”

The others of the team followed his eyes.

“Hush! Be quiet, don’t disturb him,” Tai Shan said in a low voice.

The others nodded. They stared at Jian Wushuang blankly by the stone table, without a word.

Under their gaze, the mist given off by Jian Wushuang slowly transformed.

The mist was getting thicker and thicker, and when thick enough, it began to turn into drops.

In a jiffy, the drops gathered into a river, waving like a tide.

The area filled with mist already became a zone surrounded by the tide.

Sword Tide, the second move of Sword Realm!

It only took Jian Wushuang three days to master the First Move of Sword Realm-Sword Fog. As for Sword Tide, he had been digging into this all the time and was only one step away from mastering it. Earlier today, when fighting with Shen Tianyu and Wu Jiu, he performed Sword Fog and simultaneously obtained a brand new insight of this move.

It was not until now that he was able to perform the second move-Sword Tide.

The power of Sword Tide was much stronger than that of Sword Fog.

Tai Shan, Mo Ying, and the others of the team were all shocked looking at the tide of Sword Essence, and they felt a sense of crisis as if they would be killed once they were blanketed by it.

“His battle strength... improved?”

The nine experts of the ninth team stared at Jian Wushuang, eyes widened, and their expression was beyond description.
