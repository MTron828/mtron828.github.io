Chapter 1500: The First White Blaze Fruit

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The moment the Iron Wing Beast died, the layer of black scales on its surface lost its spirituality and its defense power was reduced tremendously. Jian Wushuang flipped his wrist and his divine power shattered the body of the Iron Wing Beast.

After the body of Iron Wing Beast shattered into pieces, a Qian Kun ring hidden in his body revealed itself.

“Qian Kung ring?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised. He quickly picked up the Qian Kun ring and swept it with consciousness. He then saw a White Blaze Fruit floating in the Qian Kun ring quietly.

“White Blaze Fruit!”

Jian Wushuang gripped tightly and there was light in his eyes, “I’m quite lucky. The very first Iron Wing Beast that I came across had a White Blaze Fruit in it.”

Only some of the Iron Wing Beasts in Wu Bei’s cave carried a White Blaze Fruit. Most of them didn’t have one.

It led to a situation whereby some Universe Gods found an Iron Wing Beast and went through the trouble to kill it but all the effort was in vain.

From how it seemed, Jian Wushuang was quite lucky.

Just then… Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A few figures plunged over simultaneously and appeared around Jian Wushuang. They were the seven Universe Gods.

“He killed the Iron Wing Beasts.”

“I was the closest to him earlier. I saw clearly that he really did take out a Qian Kun ring from the Iron Wing Beasts!”

“In other words, he has a White Blaze Fruit with him!”

The seven Universe Gods naturally fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang.

“Crimson robe, carrying a sword, this look… you’re Jian Wushuang!” One of the blue-haired old ladies recognized Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang? A top expert in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list?”

“A White Blaze Fruit is in his hands?”

The few Universe Gods’ faces grew grave.

If it was an ordinary Universe God who had gotten the White Blaze Fruit, they definitely would take action to fight for it without hesitation.

However, the one who had the White Blaze Fruit was Jian Wushuang.

He was in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list. A person’s name could protect them, just like a tree’s shadow could shelter one from heat. The few Universe Gods naturally were reluctant.

“Humph, so what if he’s an expert on?Universe God ranking list? We are all Universe Gods and I don’t think these people on Universe God ranking list are stronger. They could kill Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven easily and I can do that too. Plus, there are seven of us. What’s there to be afraid of?” A middle-aged man with dark skin bellowed.

Hearing what he had said, the other Universe Gods looked at each other in surprise and started hesitating.

“If you want to take action against an expert on Universe God ranking list, it’s your choice. I’m not interested,” the blue-haired lady said and retreated.

“That’s great. We have one less person to fight with us,” the middle-aged man with dark skin smirked coldly, “He’s just an expert on the Universe God ranking list and he is only at the twentieth rank. He’s not even a Real God. With the six of us joining forces, why should we be afraid of him?”

The few hesitating Universe Gods suddenly shimmered with joy and they nodded heavily after giving some thoughts.

“Jian Wushuang, give us the White Blaze Fruit and we will let you off,” the middle-aged man with dark skin roared.

“Pass us the White Blaze Fruit!”

“Don’t make us take action against you.”

The remaining five Universe Gods fixed their gazes upon Jian Wushuang and cornered him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang smirked at the sight. He flipped and took out the Qian Kun ring he had got from the Iron Wing Beast’s body.

“The White Blaze Fruit is here. If you are capable enough, come and take it,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

Looking at the Qing Kun ring in Jian Wushuang’s hand, there was madness in the six Universe Gods’ eyes.

The middle-aged man with dark skin sounded cold, “As he is courting death, let us grant his death wish. After we kill him, we shall fight for the White Blaze Fruit with our own power.”

“Alright,” The other five Universe Gods nodded simultaneously.

Then, swoosh!

The six figures plunged towards Jian Wushuang to launch an attack at the same time.

There was a murderous intention that flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His figure turned illusionary and he appeared before the middle-aged man with dark skin who was at the far front. Then, he wielded the Blood Mountain Sword.

Fast, too fast!

At least to the middle-aged man, it was extremely unbelievable. He couldn’t react at all and his throat was pierced by Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

“How could it be that fast?”

Before he died, the middle-aged man’s eyes were wide-open.

After he killed the middle-aged man with one stroke, Jian Wushuang’s figures became illusionary again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figures appeared in five different positions creepily and he performed the same Sword Principle when he appeared.

It looked like an ordinary stroke, but because it contained a slight bit of Power of Spacetime, the Sword Principle was so swift that the five Universe Gods were unable to respond in time.

Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!

The sound of five blades piercing into bodies was heard. In an instant, the entire universe quieted down.

The six Universe Gods who had coveted Jian Wushuang’s White Blaze Fruit and taken action against him were killed by Jian Wushuang’s quick attacks.

After killing the six Universe Gods, Jian Wushuang slowly reined in his sword and stole a glance at the blue-haired old lady who had retreated far away. The blue-haired old lady who was covered in fear and astonishment, noticed Jian Wushuang’s gaze and she immediately bowed politely at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t make it difficult for the blue-haired old lady. He moved and immediately left.

The blue-haired old lady stood in the void as she watched Jian Wushuang leave. She then let out a breath of relief as she looked at the six dead bodies scattered on the ground. There was disdain in her eyes.

“These six idiots didn’t even know who they were. They had the guts to take action against an expert in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list. Just how stupid were they?” The blue-haired old lady said, but she also knew that the six Universe Gods definitely belonged to those solo experts who weren’t experienced. They cultivated to that point and they might not see any true experts on Universe God ranking list.

Usually, they would only hear legends about experts on the Universe God ranking list.

But hearing legends and witnessing with one’s own eyes were two different matters. Most of them didn’t believe in legends.

Naturally, they were in doubt of an expert on Universe God ranking list’s power. To the point where they thought that even if they weren’t as strong as the experts of the Universe God ranking list, they shouldn’t be too far off.

Just like the middle-aged man with dark skin earlier, who had reckoned so.

She was different. She came from a medium-sized sect in Red Dragon Sanctuary. She once saw an expert on Universe God ranking list in action. The expert was only seventieth on the Universe God ranking list, but he was extremely powerful. She felt totally hopeless and didn’t have any intention to counter-attack.

The one earlier who had appeared before them was a superb existence from the top twenty.

Such an existence could match evenly or even defeat a Real God. How could the few Universe Gods join forces and expect to be able to match evenly with him?

The blue-haired old lady was glad that she hadn’t taken action. Otherwise, she definitely would be the same as the other six people and have become one of the dead bodies scattered on the ground.

She sighed with emotion. Then, the blue-haired old lady took out a token.

“Sect Master, there’s a White Blaze Fruit here.”
