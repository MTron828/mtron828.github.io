Chapter 2396: Special Quota

“Elder Wujian, is Jian Wushuang an outer disciple?” Ling Gong looked over to his direction.

“Yes,” Elder Wujian admitted.

Ling Gong frowned deeper.

“Although that young man is only an outer disciple. He is much more talented than many core disciples. It’s no exaggeration to say that he is the most remarkable genius I’ve ever seen.” Elder Wujian added.

The Seventh Elder sneered, “What a joke. If he really has such a phenomenal talent as you said, then why is he just an outer disciple? The assessment for core disciples is always open in Narcissus Island. As long as he is capable, he could become a core disciple at any time. Yet, he still stays as an outer disciple, doesn’t he?”

Elder Wujian’s expression changed slightly.

The Seventh Elder was speaking the truth.

As long as he passed the harsh test, Jian Wushuang could be promoted as the core disciple of Narcissus Island and he could attempt the test at any time.

Jian Wushuang had never attempted the test.

Many people would assume that Jian Wushuang did not attempt the test because he knew he had not achieved the ability to pass the test. In fact, Elder Wujian knew very well that Jian Wushuang did not want to be a core disciple. However, he could not say it out loud.

“All I want to say is that this young man is very talented. If he goes to the Saint’s Tomb, he will definitely gain a lot,” said Elder Wujian with a serious face.

“Huh! Gain a lot? Elder Wujian, I’m curious to know how you are related to the young man. I wonder if he is your illegitimate son as the rumor which spread among the disciples? How could a dignified elder speak nonsense for the young man!” The Seventh Elder snorted coldly.

“Are you crazy, Jin? Do you even hear yourself?” Anger was burning in Elder Wujian’s eyes.

“What? Was I wrong?” The Seventh Elder stared down at Elder Wujian with sarcasm. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You!” Elder Wujian was furious.

“Alright, shut up!” Ling Gong finally spoke.

His tone was gentle but firm. Elder Wujian and the Seventh Elder instantly stopped arguing.

“Seventh Elder, you said that Elder Wujian was talking nonsense. What made you say so?” Ling Gong glanced at the Seventh Elder.

“Lord and fellow elders, we all knew how dangerous the Saint’s Tomb is. That’s the reason we nominated core disciples who are from the Second-Class Divine Demons or even higher ranked than Second-Class Divine Demons. Do you know what Jian Wushuang rank is?”

“Elder Wujian, I’ll let you tell everyone the answer.” The Seventh Elder smiled coldly.

The other Elders all had their eyes on Elder Wujian.

Elder Wujian’s expression sank, but he did not keep quiet. “Lord and fellow elders. Jian Wushuang’s realm is indeed lower. He probably has just broken through and reached the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm, but his combat power is exceptional. I dare say that his ability is by no means weaker than a Second-Class Divine Demon!”

The Seventh Elder sneered. “Haha, you all heard him. Elder Wujian had the cheek to say that Jian Wushuang, a young man who just broke through the Peak of Chaotic Realm, actually possesses the power of a Second-Class Divine Demon! Do you all believe him? I wouldn’t trust a word he said!”

The other elders furrowed their brows slightly.

The Chaotic Realm and the Divine Demon Realm were too far apart.

A Peak Stage Chaotic Realm and one who had just broken through was barely able to compete against an ordinary Third-Class Divine Demon. However, to be comparable to the power of a Second-Class Divine Demon was indeed impossible!

Even if there was such a genius, it was not possible to happen in the small Wusha Wilderness.

“Elder Wujian, what is going on?” Ling Gong looked over.

“Lord and fellow elders, I know that you may not believe it. Jian Wushuang would also never make a move to prove his abilities, but he truly possesses the power of a Second-Class Divine Demon or even stronger than that. I’ll definitely let him into the Saint’s Tomb,” said Wujian in a somber voice.

“Definitely let him in?” The expressions of the people around turned grave and they seemed to have been reminded of something.

“Elder Wujian, are you planning to use your special quota?” The Seventh Elder squinted slightly and studied Elder Wujian’s face.

Elder Wujian nodded. “Yes. According to the rules of Narcissus Island. As one the elder of the Circle of Elders, not only do I have an Elder’s Token, but I also have a special quota to nominate someone to enter the Saint’s Tomb. Although I only have one chance to use the special quota and will no longer have it in the future after using it, I’ll use the special quota for the young man now!”

The special quota was the same as an Elder’s Tokens and each elder had only one chance to exercise his right. It can be used to allow a disciple to enter the Saint’s Tomb, regardless of the disciple’s rank and strength. Once the quota was used, it would be gone forever. The Saint’s Tomb would open up again and again, but the elder would no longer be able to nominate someone with the special quota. That was why the elders saw that as something absolutely important and would never use it without careful considerations. Yet, Elder Wujian was giving his quota away to Jian Wushuang.

The Seventh Elder roared. “Crazy, you must be crazy! Elder Wujian, do you know the importance of this special quota? You have just become an elder not long ago and there will be countless geniuses in the future, but you are giving both your Elder’s Token and special quota away to the young man. Do you have so much confidence in him?”

“Yes, I would put my trust in him. What can you do about it?” Elder Wujian was not willing to submit to the pressure. He directed his gaze at Ling Gong again and announced solemnly, “Lord, I recommend Jian Wushuang to the Saint’s Tomb with my special quota. Could this be done?”

Ling Gong looked hard at Elder Wujian and then nodded. “No one could object to you using your special quota to nominate him as a candidate. Not even me.”

Elder Wujian’s eyes suddenly lit up.

“Alright, now eight places have been confirmed. Only the last two are left. Let’s continue the discussion...” said Ling Gong.

The elders continued discussing and soon, the last two slots have been determined.

Ten candidates were identified and Jian Wushuang was one of them.

Although Jian Wushuang had the qualifications to enter the Saint’s Tomb, he could not get the safety token.

Nothing could be done about it as there were only three safety tokens. Zhong Yi and Su Tong, who was recognized as the top two in talent and strength, each received one. The last one was given to a core disciple with stronger power but weaker life-saving abilities. Of course, there was nothing left for Jian Wushuang.

After the candidates were determined, the elders left one after another.

When they were leaving, they all gave Elder Wujian a strange look.

The Seventh Elder could not help but ridicule Elder Wujian at every chance he got.

Elder Wujian did not bother to pay attention to them. He went straight to the Outer Court to look for Jian Wushuang.
