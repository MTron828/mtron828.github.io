4433 The Focus of Thousands

Within the universe.

Jian Wushuang drove universe boat forward.

He sat cross-legged in the universe cabin with a frosty look in his eyes.

Supreme Bing Ye!

!!

This person was definitely one of the people that Jian Wushuang wanted to kill the most!

If the Blood Sky Hall Master, the great sun Emperor God, and Scarlet Sun Demon Master were accomplices, then Supreme Bing Ye was the culprit!

The White Tiger Supreme had been forced by Supreme Bing Ye to self-destruct.

The enmity between him and Supreme Bing Ye was absolutely irreconcilable!

Supreme Master Bing Ye had led troops to kill him countless times. For example, if it wasn’t for white-hair ancestor’s help, he would have died at that time!

Even earlier on the Ancient Path of Stars, Qiu Long was sent by Supreme Bing Ye to kill Jian Wushuang. If it wasn’t for this incident, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t have gradually become enemies with the dragon clan.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had no fear of this. However, his hatred for Supreme Bing Ye was already monstrous!

“Waiting to kill me in the Great Void Temple?”

Jian Wushuang sneered.

He had naturally heard of this declaration of war that Supreme Bing Ye had issued to the entire universe.

This caused his killing intent toward Supreme Bing Ye to rise to another level!

Even today, Supreme Bing Ye’s intention to kill him had not died!

“Very good. I’d like to see how you’re going to kill me!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and there was a flash of coldness.

…

Within the Great Void Temple.

Supreme Bing Ye sat on his throne with a sneer on his face. He was constantly stroking the blade of a dark blue divine sword in his hand.

This sword was called the God Killer.

Back then, he had tried to kill Jian Wushuang in the savage Lands of the universe, but the tyrants’ patriarch had appeared and saved Jian Wushuang. His sword, the ice ye divine sword, which had the same name as him, had been swallowed by the tyrants’ patriarch.

He had spent a fortune to buy this sword from an unrivaled Supreme martial artist. It was as powerful as the Bing Ye divine sword, and might even be stronger.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll use you as a sacrifice to my sword!”

Clang!

Supreme Bing Ye flipped his right hand and pointed the tip of his sword at the void outside the palace, emitting a chilling aura.

“Hmph! Don’t wait until I break through to become an invincible Ruler! Otherwise, the Divine Life Palace and the tyrants ‘patriarch will all die for me!”

He snorted coldly in his heart. He was also brooding over the fact that the tyrants’ patriarch had destroyed his divine sword and sent him flying with a single punch.

“Men, come.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After a while, he put away the God-slaying sword and called out to the outside.

Da da da da.

A disciple of the Great Void Temple immediately walked in.

“Let me ask you. Where is Jian Wushuang now? Is there anything unusual?”

The disciple kneeled on the ground and replied, “Sir Emperor God, Jian Wushuang is rushing toward the Great Void Temple. There is nothing unusual.”

“Well, that’s good.”

Supreme Bing Ye nodded his head and sneered in a low voice.

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang, this is the first time I’ve seen someone so eager to die in the universe.”

…

Jian Wushuang steered universe boat and approached the Great Void Temple.

Along the way, he did not have any intention of concealing his aura. Therefore, wherever he went, a wave of exclamations would surge forth.

“Look, this, this aura is Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang’s target is the Great Void Temple!”

“Tsk tsk, Supreme Bing is not a kind person. This battle is going to be interesting.”

“Jian Wushuang is indeed strong, but Supreme Bing Ye is also a tough nut to crack. Many half-step invincible Supremes have died at his hands. It’s hard to say whether Jian Wushuang can gnaw off this tough nut. It’s all up to Jian Wushuang’s own fortune.”

“If Jian Wushuang can kill him, let alone kill Supreme Bing Ye, then Jian Wushuang can be almost certain that he is the strongest person below the invincible Supreme!

“Let’s go, let’s go. This battle is unprecedented and rare. We must not miss it!”

“Hurry to the Great Void Temple. It’s going to be lively this time!”

“I heard that all the major forces have sent people to watch the battle. Once Jian Wushuang wins, they will make him their new king!”

Countless people were discussing fervently.

After that, they all flew in the direction of the Great Void Temple.

Among them, there were representatives sent by the major forces. They had already brought the mystic Light mirror with them, planning to record the details of the battle.

Even the Water Sorcerer Ruler and his two disciples, whom Jian Wushuang had once saved in the Tarot ruins, had come from the extremely distant desolate area of the universe to cheer for Jian Wushuang.

There was also Emperor Golden Crow, commander Mountain Shaker, Stardust Ruler, and many others who were related to Jian Wushuang.

...

Everyone was looking forward to this battle!

…

Three months later.

Jian Wushuang arrived at the star Domain where the Great Void Temple was located.

The great void Star field was already filled with people who came from all directions to watch the battle. Their flags fluttered like waves.

Jian Wushuang stopped universe boat and walked out of the cabin.

He heard a lot of noise and many familiar faces.

“Lord Blood Sword, good luck!” Ruler Hao Jin had an excited look on his face as he called out loudly from afar.

“Blood Sword, you will definitely win! Go!” Water Sorcerer Ruler and the other two were red-faced as they stood at the very edge of the crowd, waving flags and cheering.

“Your Excellency Sword doesn’t abandon, be careful!” The Stardust Ruler, who was now all alone, clenched his fists and shouted.

Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned. He glanced at the familiar faces and smiled faintly.

...

“Don’t worry!”

Jian Wushuang nodded at them, then turned to look at the center of the great void Star area, where the Great Void Temple was floating quietly. He took a deep breath.

Like a whale sucking in water, he sucked in all the wind energy within a thousand feet into his mouth.

The next moment.

He opened his mouth and spoke. His voice was like a thunderclap, rolling down and shaking all Nine Heavens and ten lands!

“Bing Ye, why don’t you come and die?”

BOOM!

As soon as he finished speaking, the starry sky within ten thousand miles was shaken to the point that the earth and mountains shook, as if a tsunami had been set off.

“Hmph, Jian Wushuang, you’re the one who should die today!”

Then, a cold voice came from the center of the Great Void Temple and destroyed the sound waves that Jian Wushuang had turned into.

Whoosh!

A white flowing light shot out and landed ten feet in front of Jian Wushuang.

The flowing light shattered, revealing the figure of Supreme Bing Ye.

Jian Wushuang, only one of us can walk out of this star area alive today.

Supreme Bing Ye stood with his hands clasped behind his back and a cold expression on his face.

“Just what I wanted.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with killing intent. He held the Tarot Divine Sword in his right hand and pulled it out of the scabbard inch by inch.

A vast sword pressure instantly descended on the entire area.

“Then come.”

Supreme Bing Ye snorted coldly. With a flip of his right hand, a Scarlet and demonic god-slaying sword appeared in his hand.

There was no nonsense between the two.

The two extremely powerful auras seemed to have taken physical form as they collided and pressed against each other in the void, setting off terrifying void storms!

When the spectators saw this, their eyes narrowed.

They knew.

The curtains were about to open on this earth-shattering battle!
