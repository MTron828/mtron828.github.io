Chapter 799: 10 Consecutive Victories

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

BANG!

An almighty bang was suddenly heard issuing from the center of the arena.

A fighter’s lower limbs had burst open and blood was spurting out.

The other fighter, a fierce man, laughed as he clenched his right hand and directed his punch towards his opponent’s head.

A faint roar akin to that of a savage beast could be heard as the wounded man’s head was pulverized. There was no doubt that he was dead.

The death did not silence the Blood Battle Arena. Instead, it caused a greater uproar.

“The winner is Skull!”

“Do you want to continue the challenge, Skull?” asked the host of the fight, who was an Eternal Realm expert.

“Haha, of course,” Skull replied after a bellow of laughter. His voice echoed through the arena.

As soon as Skull had announced his decision, a superior Divine Realm expert arrived at the arena and tried to challenge him.

Jian Wushuang continued to sit in the audience and watched their fight silently.

He watched more than 10 fierce fights successively. Of the 13 men who were defeated in these fights, only three survived. The other 10 died on the arena.

This was the brutality and madness of the Blood Battle Arena.

There were two kinds of Blood Battle Arenas, one for Divine Realm experts and the other for Eternal Realm experts.

The fight between experts in the Eternal Realm took place only once every month, with at most a dozen duels each time. It was violent but not crazy.

However, the fight between the Divine Realm experts took place every day, and thus a large number of Divine Realm experts died every day.

Even so, there was no stopping the madness.

Cercis Island had many more experts in the Divine Realm than in the Eternal Realm. Their large number made them insignificant.

“These Divine Realm experts clearly know that the odds of death are very high, and that those who dare to fight in the Blood Battle Arena are all superior Divine Realm experts. Still, they continue to challenge themselves. It’s really… ”?Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

Divine Realm experts who could obtain Cercis Tokens would reap many benefits on Cercis Island.

Other benefits aside, permanent residency on the island had great appeal, in addition to the privilege of killing people.

Furthermore, the Cercis Token could be sold for an astronomical price.

As the benefits were so attractive, the Divine Realm experts were willing to take risks.

“For me, there’s no need to waste time watching the life-or-death duels between Divine Realm experts,” Jian Wushuang muttered as he shook his head subtly. Then he walked to the arena and signed up for the fight.

The frenzied fight continued on the arena. Jian Wushuang had no idea how many superior Divine Realm experts had appeared on the arena, but he had not seen anyone win five fights in a row. That was, until a girl in a green dress appeared on the arena.

The girl showed remarkable strength with a spear. She defeated six superior Divine Realm experts with ease.

“She is quite good. She must be close to the peak of the Divine Realm,”?Jian Wushuang speculated silently.

At this point…

“The next challenger is Swordsman!” the host shouted wildly.

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were arched and he smiled as he appeared on the arena like a phantom.

Immediately, the attention of the audience was directed at him.

“Ow, ow, ow!!!” The frenzied howls from the audience continued.

Jian Wushuang ignored the noise as he turned his eyes to the girl opposite him.

“Swordsman? Is that an alias?” The girl looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“You seem confident.” The girl smiled.

“Not bad.”

“Be careful then. It’s a life-or-death duel. I have no intention of killing you, but if I can’t stop my attack, you can’t blame me.” With that, the girl began to attack Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh!

The long spear was thrusted straight at Jian Wushuang.

As the spear moved, a series of strange-looking whirlpools appeared in the void.

The speed of the spear was extraordinary.

“Good,” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

At first glance, Jian Wushuang already knew that the girl had condensed her Spear Heart which was already steady at Level One. Thus, her overall strength was comparable to that of the most powerful Divine Realm expert.

Normally, it would not be difficult for her to win 10 consecutive battles to get a Cercis Token. Unfortunately, she had run into Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang struck.

It was a casual, ordinary blow.

The girl was stunned by the movement as she could not see its tracks at all.

With a crash, the girl’s long spear flew out of her hand. Blood gushed out from the new cut on her wrist.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his sword and stood still.

“Thank, thank you!”

The girl looked at Jian Wushuang gratefully. She retrieved her long spear and hurried off the arena.

She was well aware that Jian Wushuang had gone easy on her.

“He’s horrifying. I’m one of the most powerful Divine Realm experts and can even fight an expert at Step One of the Eternal Realm, but he defeated me with one blow. If he didn’t show mercy, I’d be dead now! It’s my first time seeing such a terrifying Divine Realm expert!”

She was still in shock even as she stepped off the arena.

The audience had started to cheer when they saw Jian Wushuang defeat the girl with a single blow.

“Swordsman!”

“Swordsman!”

The audience chanted his name.

The host asked, “Swordsman, do you want to continue the challenge?”

“Yes, of course,” replied Jian Wushuang, smiling.

Subsequently, several people challenged him.

These challengers were very strong. Each of them was a superior Divine Realm expert. Some were almost as skillful as the strongest Divine Realm experts. But to Jian Wushuang, they were weak. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

One blow!

As he had done with his first opponent,?Jian Wushuang defeated the next nine challengers with one blow.

Unsurprisingly, he obtained 10 consecutive victories.

Jian Wushuang was merciful and did not kill his opponents. Only one challenger had been killed because he had continued to fight despite being wounded by Jian Wushuang.
