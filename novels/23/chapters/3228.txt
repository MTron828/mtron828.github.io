Chapter 3231: Nemesis

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

The Nine Temples Saintess was the strongest soul expert among the Immortal Saints in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Like the Light King, although he had fused the principles of light and wind while also studying the soul, his attainment in the soul aspect was not as good as the Nine Temples Saintess, and the most powerful move of the Nine Temples Saintess, which was aimed at the destruction of the soul, was something that few of the Immortal Saints could resist.

Moreover, the Nine Temples Saintess had used this most powerful move to kill an Invincible Saint, which ranked third on the True Saint List.

In other words, her most powerful move aimed at the destruction of the soul was something that even an ordinary Invincible Saint could not resist. However, Jian Wushuang was only a rank six True Saint. Although his soul was relatively tough, and he had the exquisite pagoda, he still could not block the move of the Nine Temple Saintess.

After the green light entered Jian Wushuang’s body, almost everyone present could sense that Jian Wushuang’s soul had been annihilated and disappeared.

Once his soul was annihilated, he would naturally die.

“Tsk, tsk, what a pity. A top-notch genius died just like that!”

“It is said that Heavenly Sword Marquis could kill a rank seven True Saint at the level of a rank four True Saint, but he is only a rank six True Saint now. We have all seen how powerful he is. Even Thunder God almost died at his hands. If such a top-notch genius did not die, he would definitely be a super expert in the future, but unfortunately…”

“I wonder what he did to make the three Saint Realms spend so much effort to kill him?”

The hundreds of experts watching the battle were all discussing.

There were some who felt pity, some who praised, and some who were gloating over Jian Wushuang’s death.

But at this moment…Jian Wushuang, who had been ‘dead’, suddenly opened his eyes, and his majestic divine power swept out again.

“What?” Thunder God was shocked.

“How is it possible?” Nine Temples Saintess was shocked.

“What, what’s going on?” The surrounding experts who were watching the battle were even more shocked.

Apart from being shocked, there was also disbelief!

They had just seen Jian Wushuang’s soul being destroyed by Nine Temples Saintess’ most powerful move, and even his soul aura had completely disappeared. Under normal circumstances, he was already dead.

But now…judging from the soaring divine power aura emitted from Jian Wushuang’s body, he was clearly still alive, and his soul aura had returned to its peak!

His soul had clearly been destroyed, but it had returned to its peak in the blink of an eye?

This scene was beyond everyone’s understanding.

“What kind of monster is this kid?” Thunder God could not help but shout in a low voice.

“No wonder, no wonder the top officials of the three Saint Realms would pay such a high price to kill a rank six True Saint. It seems that Heavenly Sword Marquis does have a big secret, and even the three Saint Realms are afraid of it.” The Nine Temples Saintess’ face turned cold.

On the side, the Light King, Silver Wolf, Gu Zhenzi, Wan Xuan, and the others from the three Saint Realms also looked very serious.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, looked at Nine Temples Saintess with interest. “Nine Temples Saintess, that was your most powerful move, right? It was indeed powerful. My soul couldn’t resist it, but unfortunately, you found the wrong person!”

“What do you mean?” Nine Temples Saintess stared at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s simple. I, Heavenly Sword Marquis, am not afraid of soul attacks because your soul attacks have no effect on me. If you don’t believe me, you can try again,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold smile.

Few people knew that soul attacks were ineffective against him. However, today, the Nine Temples Saintess destroyed his soul in front of so many people, but he did not die. Therefore, his trump card was naturally exposed, he was too lazy to hide this trick.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, the Nine Temples Saintess’ face completely darkened.

She was the Immortal Saint with the strongest soul in the Divine Beginning Realm, but Jian Wushuang was completely immune to soul attacks?

Did this mean that Jian Wushuang was her nemesis?

“Thunder God, and the three Saint Realms, I have no choice,” the Nine Temples Saintess said in a low voice.

The experts of the three Saint Realms looked extremely ugly, while Silver Wolf looked directly at Light King, “Light King, this Heavenly Sword Marquis’s methods are too strange. I’m afraid that it will be very difficult to kill him just by relying on the Saint Realms of the three Saint Realms. Therefore, I can only ask you to act. You have fused two great principles. The power of the fusion of these two great principles is enough to destroy heaven and earth. Even divine power can be destroyed. If you act, this Heavenly Sword Marquis might not be able to withstand it.”

“I can try.” Light King did not refuse. With a whoosh, he appeared on the battlefield and swung the green long staff in his hand.

It looked simple, but this staff had perfectly combined the two principles of light and wind, making it several times more terrifying.

Even an expert like Di Hao who was qualified to be in the top three on the True Saint List and could barely superimpose the two principles could not resist this staff.

But now, this strike was directed at Jian Wushuang.

Buzz!

The mighty strike came straight at Jian Wushuang. The moment Jian Wushuang saw the strike, he immediately felt that he could not resist it.

“Is this the power formed by the fusion of the two principles?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the long staff in front of him. He carefully felt the power contained in the strike until the strike was less than three meters away from him. Then, he waved the long spear in his hand, a trace of violent aura swept up.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

Although he knew that his sword could not withstand a single blow from the staff shadow of the Light King, Jian Wushuang did not want to sit still and wait for his death.

Bang!

The terrifying power instantly destroyed Jian Wushuang’s sword form and completely covered Jian Wushuang’s divine body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s divine body collapsed at the first moment, but the power of the two fused principles contained in the staff shadow was still wantonly destroying Jian Wushuang’s divine power.

It must be noted that when the Light King killed the Invincible Saint, he only used one staff to kill him, which prevented him from regenerating his divine body because the power of the integration of rules contained in the King of Light’s staff skill could directly destroy a cultivator’s divine power, the Invincible Saint’s divine body was destroyed at the same time, his divine power was also completely destroyed by the principles fusion power contained in the staff skill.

But now, the principles fusion power faced Jian Wushuang…buzz!

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang’s divine body was rebuilt again.
