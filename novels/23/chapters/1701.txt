Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, where’s the White Blaze Fruit that you brought for me?” Sir God Mad Dog looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled. He flipped his wrist and took out two White Blaze Fruits.

“Two?” Sir God Mad Dog beamed with joy. “Not bad, not bad.”

Sir God Mad Dog put the two White Blaze Fruits into his Qian Ku ring. Then, he said leisurely, “Young man, tell me then. Why did you look for me?”

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

Sir God Mad Dog behaved like a crazy man but, in actual fact, he was shrewd.

He knew that Jian Wushuang needed help as he had looked for him and brought him two White Blaze Fruits.

“I really do need help from Sir God Mad Dog. It’s regarding the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?” Sir God Mad Dog’s eyes fixed. He was originally enjoying the Resentful Soul Fruit with appetite and relish but he suddenly paused.

“Don’t tell me you’re planning to go to Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“I do have this plan in mind,” Jian Wushuang smiled and didn’t hide it.

“Tsk tsk. It’s useless. Even if you plan to, you can’t enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning,” Sir God Mad Dog continued to eat the fruit. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Why?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“This…” Sir God Mad Dog was going to explain.

“Finally found him!”

An angry roar suddenly spread from the void before. Dark Sky Fortress Master led his troop of black armored soldiers behind him and plunged towards Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog.

The eyes of Dark Sky Fortress Master gave out flagrant murderous intention. Especially when he saw the half-eaten Resentful Soul Fruit in Sir God Mad Dog’s hand, his eyes turned bloodshot and red.

“Old man, how dare you take my Resentful Soul Fruit. I want you dead and I’ll crush you into ashes today!” Dark Sky Fortress Master’s roar shook the sky.

Sir God Mad Dog couldn’t be bothered. He even intentionally took another bite of the Resentful Soul Fruit in front of Dark Sky Fortress Master and then threw the rest away, “Hehe, I’ll give it back to you then.”

“Give it back to me? You’ve almost finished it and you’ll give it back to me?” Dark Sky Fortress Master was raging with anger, “Die!”

An outstanding aura was released from Dark Sky Fortress Master’s body. The aura had already reached the level of an Eternal Real God.

An Eternal Real God was definitely a superb existence of overlord level in Holy Kingdom. Some Kings of Holy Kingdoms were merely on that level as well.

At such a level, they were like ants before Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog.

Looking at the Dark Sky Fortress Master charging at them, Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold.

“Go away!”

There was a low bellow.

The voice was low but it shook the hearts of the Dark Sky Fortress Master and the black-armored soldiers behind him like a clap of loud thunder.

Dark Sky Fortress Masterm who was originally angry and wanted to kill Sir God Mad Dog, suddenly stiffened. There was an unprecedented fear in his eyes. He stared at Jian Wushuang as his heart grew numb.

Jian Wushuang had already reached the level of stage two Ultimate Real God. His divine power and divine body were of the level of an Almighty. His power was naturally of Almighty level. Just how strong and powerful would his low bellow be?

Dark Sky Fortress Master could only feel that his divine body was going to explode from the roar. He could feel that the young man carrying a sword on his back could kill him countless times with one thought.

If he felt so, the black-armored soldiers behind him were even more terrified.

“I’m sorry, Mister. We shall leave immediately!”

“Go now!”

Dark Sky Fortress Master had no more temper. His earlier anger had vanished into thin air. He immediately led his troops and ran away quickly.

When the people had left, Jian Wushuang looked at Sir God Mad Dog again, “Sir God Mad Dog, you said I can’t enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, why?”

“Don’t panic,” Sir God Mad Dog waved and an ancient green spaceship appeared in the void before them, “Let’s go, we will talk on the spaceship. Let’s move as we talk.”

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The two of them immediately got onto the spaceship. Sir God Mad Dog drove the spaceship and plunged outside of Holy Kingdom of Dark Light.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog sat opposite one another as they chatted.

“Jian Wushuang, as you heard about Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, you definitely know the origins of Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, right?” Sir God Mad Dog asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “It is said that an expert retrieved a drop of Power of Absolute Beginning from an ancient battlefield. Then, it developed and evolved into Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

“Mm, that’s true, but you must understand that the evolution of Power of Absolute Beginning took a very long time. From the one drop of divine power in the beginning to a divine pond, God knows how many years it took,” Sir God Mad Dog started to explain.

“In the end, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning got bigger and the effect got more shocking. There was a rumor that said that a severely injured Emperor God had entered the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and resumed his peak in three years. That’s true because I saw it with my own eyes.”

“However, although the Emperor God resumed his peak, he expanded the Power of Absolute Beginning in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for three years. After such expense, Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning would need at least tens of thousands of years of evolution until it could be recovered.”

“That’s why the Emperor God paid a price that equaled half of his possessions.”

“Half his possessions?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

Emperor God was the level of a Star Palace Master.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, a super expert that was second to the Great Emperor.

Such a top expert had shockingly great possessions, far beyond what Jian Wushuang could imagine.

However, merely recovering in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for three years had cost him half of his possessions?

The price was too high.

“It’s so even for Emperor God. As for you…” Sir God Mad Dog looked at Jian Wushuang, “Young man, you are an inverse cultivator. If you were to make a trip to Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and expend Power of Absolute Beginning, I reckon it shouldn’t be any less than for the Emperor God.”

“From what I know, a long time ago, when Real God Wu Bei was still alive, he once found the owner of Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, Sir God Luo Sha, and he offered a great price and talked terms with Sir God Luo Sha. Sir God Luo Sha had originally thought he was just a Real God and even as an inverse cultivator, he would at most take a year’s or two years’ worth of Power of Absolute Beginning from Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. Then, he agreed.”

“But in the end, Real God Wu Bei stayed in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for eight years. He also absorbed eight years of Power of Absolute Beginning and never came out. Sir God Luo Sha was furious and he chased Real God Wu Bei out by force!”

“After that incident, when Sir God Luo Sha found out how much Power of Absolute Beginning from Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning he lost, he nearly killed Real God Wu Bei!”
