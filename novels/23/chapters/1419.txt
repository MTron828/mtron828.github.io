Chapter 1420: Life and Death

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Go through nine reincarnations, combine memories from nine different lives and recognize oneself.

That was the Nine Lives Reincarnation Test.

Jian Wushuang, standing below the clouds, had bloodshot eyes which showed an unprecedented madness.

In his head, the memories from nine different lives were devouring his consciousness.

“I, Mu Chen, the richest man in the world, can get anything I want from the universe. Give me your body and I will let you enjoy no end of wealth and honor!”

From the very first life, the memory of the number one rich businessman who had built the Noble Hall, Mu Chen, was replaying in Jian Wushuang’s head.

…

“I have been the Emperor for a long time. The royal power belongs to me. Who dares to go against me in the world?”

“This body belongs to me!

From the second life came the memory of the emperor, Jin Mo. He bellowed in madness.

…

“Qiu Er, my Qiu Er. Where is she?”

“I’m going to look for her. No one can stop me!”

The memory from the seventh life brought about an unprecedented stubbornness that was going to eat up Jian Wushuang’s consciousness.

The eight life, the ninth life…

The memories from the nine lives were like Jian Wushuang living through nine different lives.

The nine Jian Wushuangs went through their lives in their respective imaginary worlds and possessed their personal consciousnesses and thoughts. They also had their own desires.

For instance, the first life went after wealth.

The second life went after absolute royal power.

The third life went after martial arts.

Simultaneously, the nine Jian Wushuangs were living together in one body. Including Jian Wushuang’s consciousness, there were ten different consciousnesses.

As the saying goes, one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers. There were ten consciousnesses in Jian Wushuang’s divine body. The nine illusionary consciousnesses would naturally consume him and fight for control of Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was distorted and his entire body was shivering vigorously. However, his features looked ferocious and he maintained absolute sobriety in his consciousness.

“Shut up!”

“All of you are merely exist in imaginary worlds!”

“You don’t exist in reality and you shouldn’t exist.”

“Regardless of how much I have been through, how many emotions, imagination is imagination after all!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth and bellowed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ahhh!!! As you’re not going to give your body to me, I shall die with you!”

The emperor from the second life, Jin Mo, bellowed. The very next moment, the illusionary consciousness merged with Jian Wushuang’s personal consciousness.

“I’ll fight with you!”

The other eight consciousness took the same path that Jin Mo did.

In that instant, nine illusionary consciousnesses merged together with Jian Wushuang’s.

Previously, the nine illusionary consciousnesses had existed in the same body as his consciousness. But then, the nine illusionary consciousnesses were merging into his own consciousness.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness was at the brink of collapsing.

He roared.

“Who am I!”

“Who the hell am I?”

“Am I Mu Chen? Jin Mo? Or Lu Xuan?”

The entire Firmament World could hear Jian Wushuang’s bellow.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, who were at the edge of Firmament World, saw the scene and their faces grew grave.

“What’s going on? I feel that his mind is on the brink of collapsing. Even the Exquisite Mirror Heart Guard Elixir won’t be of help. It couldn’t protect his mind. What is he experiencing?” Hall Master Yuan was anxious.

“His mind is on the edge. If it were to persist, his mind would collapse. By then, he would become a mad devil. He’d rather die than stay alive.” Lei Chao’s eyebrows were tightly knitted as well.

Both of them could feel the gravity of Jian Wushuang’s current situation.

It was definitely very dangerous. Only a little more to go before Jian Wushuang would drown in the unreturned path.

Just that one bit.

“Just that one bit. He must steady himself. Otherwise, he’s doomed,” Hall Master Yuan clenched his hand together.

The two of them stared at Jian Wushuang and felt Jian Wushuang’s change.

Jian Wushuang stood at the edge of the cliff with half of his foot hanging off.

At that point, even a casual breeze could send him into the bottomless abyss.

Fortunately, he didn’t step out the remaining half a step.

Under the clouds, Jian Wushuang had become mad and let out an angry bellow like a devil. In the depths of his eyes and in the bottom of his heart, there was still a hint of light.

Jian Wushuang was glad that he had trained up his state of mind to the first level in Dark Phoenix Pavilion.

It was because he reached the first level. His true will could just about maintain its tinge of brightness.

Otherwise, he would have been possessed entirely.

“It seems like he managed to guard the last bit of his mind!” Hall Master Yuan sighed a breath of relief.

“Even so, the situation isn’t favorable. Who knows what he’s going through right now? His last bit of mind, how long can he maintain it for?” Lei Chao said in a deep voice.

“Even so, it’s better than a collapsed mind. Now that he’s steadied his last bit of mind, there is space for a struggle. Now it comes down to how determined the man is,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Determination!

Yes, what Jian Wushuang needed then was to be determined.

He steadied the last bit of his mind. As long as he could stay calm until he could remove the illusions and recognize himself clearly, he would pass the test.

But in the process, every breath was a life and death torture to Jian Wushuang. However, it would still be a while until he would undo the illusions and recognize himself.

Naturally, his determination was the key element.

Under the clouds, Jian Wushuang looked like a mad devil, just as before, but he had calmed down after his bellowing.

In his sea of consciousness, his consciousness had drowned in an unprecedented chaos. Countless illusionary memories overlapped with his own memories and it became complicated. In the beginning, Jian Wushuang couldn’t differentiate himself. However, he guarded his last bit of mind. Gradually, he understood his identity.

“I’m a disciple of Star Palace!”

“I am the husband of Leng Rushuang!”

“I am the direct descendant of Xuan Yi!”

“I came from Green Fire World, Sword Marquis Mansion in Nanyang Land!”

“My name is Jian Wushuang!”

A shrill scream reverberated through Jian Wushuang’s body. In the complicated consciousness, his personal consciousness gradually took up the leading position. Then, he quickly started removing the illusionary consciousnesses one by one.

During this process, every single step was dangerous.

With the slightest carelessness, his own mind would have collapsed.
