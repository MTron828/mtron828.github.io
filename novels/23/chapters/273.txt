Chapter 274: The Kingdom of Death

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As the number one dynasty in Nanyang Continent, the Tang Dynasty was famous as a Slaughter Dynasty.

It was vast with an area 10 times larger than that of ordinary large empires and was internally divided into 21 large prefectures, each prefecture taking up a large space with many cities.

Jian Wushuang rushed along the Northern Region, and 10 days later, he made it to the domain of the Tang Dynasty. The first city he saw was the Devil Heart City of Skywave Prefecture.

This city was just one common city among the thousands of cities in the Tang Dynasty.

In spite of this, the city was still full of chaos and danger.

Among the many gangs in the Devil Heart City, the Bloodseeker Gang and the Hungry Wolf Gang were the strongest.

These two evenly-matched gangs had been battling with each other all the time in the city, leading to a violent fight every two or three days.

Longsword on his back, Jian Wushuang, who looked young but frosty, stepped into the Devil Heart City in black.

There were a few people in the street. The surrounding buildings were tattered mostly because of the fierce battles while the ground was riddled with potholes. However, in those dilapidated houses gathered some vociferous Warriors in twos and threes.

Those Warriors’ strength differed widely. The weaker ones were at the level of Gold Core while the stronger ones were at the level of Yin Void. What they had in common was that they all showed a strong desire for killing.

The Tang Dynasty was the heaven of killer but the hell of the merciful.

Everyone here was decisive in killing as all of them were the real experts who struggled up from nothing.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, the entire street suddenly became quiet.

The Warriors in the surrounding buildings stopped talking, casting their cold eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Such a young man, he seems no more than 20. That’s very bold of him to come here at such a young age.”

“Generally, there are only three kinds of people who’d like to venture out in the Tang Dynasty. The first kind is the people wanted by powerful forces. They come in despair and want to seek their survivals here.”

“The second kind is the genius from the big sects. They’re gifted with extraordinary talent and come here on purpose for experience.”

“The last kind is the warlike maniacs with the burning desire to kill and to grow stronger in the killing.”

“I was wondering which kind of person this young man is.”

“Whichever, there must be a story behind him. A man like him is always worth much.”

The surrounding Warriors stared at Jian Wushuang, and some of them even stuck out their tongues, licking their lips.

There were countless experts in the Tang Dynasty, but they were generally older. When a young expert appeared in the Tang Dynasty, it always meant that he was one of the three kinds of people and might have many treasures like an Interspatial Ring with him.

Thus, Jian Wushuang’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention.

Some of them were even targeting him.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Two figures abruptly appeared beside Jian Wushuang like ghosts, and immediately two chilly flashes thrust toward Jian Wushuang’s vitals from both left and right.

“Damn it!”

“They are one step ahead of us.”

“They’re... Qing Ling and Qing Hai, two brothers.”

“Both of them were the experts in the Initial Yin Void Realm. Beyond that, they were well-trained killers before coming to the Tang Dynasty. Being attacked jointly by them, this young man is dead.”

All the surrounding Warriors sighed when they heard this.

Jian Wushuang stopped walking when he noticed two strong wind coming toward him, but he still looked calm. In the twinkling of an eye, he unsheathed the Triple-kill Sword on his back, showing a cold sword light.

“PSSSH!PSSSH!”

When the sound of sword penetrating into flesh was heard twice, Jian Wushuang had already pushed his Triple-kill Sword back into the sheath. He kept going forward while Qing Ling and Qing Hai were staying still in the Void. But soon, the brothers fell down to the ground.

The street fell into silence for a moment. Until Jian Wushuang walked away, it suddenly burst into roaring.

“Qing Ling and Qing Hai were killed ?”

“Anyone spotted how he stabbed the brothers?”

“No, I didn’t even see him draw his sword.”

The Warriors were all in amazement. An expert with the Cultivation of Spiritual Power in the Yang Void Realm said with a smile, “Even if it’s me facing the attack like that, I could not say I can withstand it. Apparently, We got another big fish in the city. But, Qing Ling and Qing Hai were at high positions in the Hungry Wolf Gang. I guess the Gang won’t let the young man go easily, according to their usual style.”

...

After casually killing the two men, Jian Wushuang went ahead, but he could not help thinking,?“As was said, the Tang Dynasty is indeed a place of no rule and no bottom line. In such a place, the strong will kill the weak for the Interspatial Ring without hesitation as long as they spot one.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head.“Besides, there are so many experts. In other dynasties, it’s hard to see experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, but in the Tang Dynasty, they are everywhere.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

Along the way he walked just now, he had seen more than a hundred of Warriors, and among them, there were more than a dozen of the people in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, even including an expert in the Yang Void Realm.

“I’m a new comer in the Tang Dynasty, so I must find a way to orient myself here first.”?Just as Jian Wushuang was thinking, he suddenly caught the sight of a restaurant in front of him.

“A restaurant?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had passed through the street and had found no shop but shabby houses. This was the first restaurant he had seen in the city, which was also the only one there.

“Bloodmoon Hotel?”?Jian Wushuang thought for a while after seeing the restaurant’s signboard and stepped directly into it.

The first thing Jian Wushuang saw in the restaurant was a huge tablet, on which it was written: Whoever damages anything like chairs, stools, wine pots, and bowls herein will be charged for a hundred times the value of the damage, excluding the experts in the Bloodmoon List.

The handwriting on the tablet was elegant and stately.

But upon seeing the tablet, Jian Wushuang’s complexion turned odd. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
