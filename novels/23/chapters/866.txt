Chapter 867: Trying Their Best

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The group fled like crazy, and the Exotic Beasts were charging quickly behind them. They had already discovered them.

Many of the Exotic Beasts in the rampage hissed, and all of them were extremely excited.

Many Exotic Beasts began to chase straight after them, and the particularly quick ones had bursts of astonishing speed.

There were many kinds of Exotic Beasts in the Stellar Fog Sea. There were a few clumsy Exotic Beasts such as One-eyed Giants, and other kinds of Exotic Beasts with astonishing speed.

When the four fled, they were very aware that the Exotic Beasts behind them were getting closer and closer.

“These Exotic Beasts are so fast!” Jian Wushuang said with a grave expression.

“They’re going to catch up soon! What should we do?” Ling Long was very worried.

“Folks, you must have prepared some life-saving skills or trump cards when you knew you would go to explore the Stellar Fog Sea, right?” Jian Wushuang looked around.

“Yes.” Ling Long nodded.

“Yes, we have some life-saving skills.” Jiu Zui and Shui Jin nodded.

“Now, if the four of us continue running away together, we will be bound to die together, so we must scatter. Whether we can survive or not can only depend on our own abilities.” Jian Wushuang licked his lips, his eyes serious.

“Scatter?” Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin looked at each other with pained expressions.

This Stellar Fog Sea was full of fog, and it was a huge maze.

Besides, when they entered the Stellar Fog Sea, their Message Token was restricted and couldn’t be used. Once the four of them separated, it would impossible for them to get back together again. Worse still, the Stellar Fog Sea was so dangerous, that if they wandered around alone, except for Jian Wushuang, the chances of them surviving were probably not high.

They would not scatter unless it was absolutely necessary.

However, Jian Wushuang was right. Right now, if they did not scatter, all of them would die together.

After they scattered, each one would depend on their own life-saving abilities, and perhaps one or two could successfully escape.

“Okay, let’s scatter!” Jiu Zui simply nodded.

“That’s the only way we have now.” Ling Long nodded.

“Folks, I wish you all good luck,” said Shui Jin solemnly.

“Good luck,” Jian Wushuang said likewise.

After that, they scattered in four directions and fled.

The Exotic Beast rampage immediately divided itself into four groups, each group chasing each person.

Jian Wushuang was followed by a large number of Exotic Beasts, but he was looking to the side.

He was looking in Ling Long’s direction. Ling Long was running like crazy, but the Exotic Beasts behind her were getting closer and closer.

“I’m finished, finished!” Ling Long’s face turned pale and she was desperate.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. “Ling Long’s life-saving ability is not bad, and she is fast. But the Exotic Beasts chasing her are similar to Winged Dragons and are extremely fast. I’ve experienced this before.”

As the group wandered around in the Stellar Fog Sea, they had come across this kind of Exotic Beast. They were similar to Winged Dragons, and the speed they showed was quite surprising.

If there was only one such Exotic Beast, it wouldn’t be terrifying. But there were nearly 100 Exotic Beasts chasing Ling Long, including dozens of Exotic Beasts similar to Winged Dragons.

At the thought of this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew serious. He rummaged and took out a token.

This token was the one that Xuan Yi had given to him for saving his life.

The token contained the Sunrise Sword Emperor’s three Sword Essences. He had used his first Sword Essence when he killed Xia Yan, but now he began to guide the second one.

Buzz!!!

Under Jian Wushuang’s guidance, a terrifying Sword Essence suddenly appeared in the void.

All of a sudden, the world changed.

The second Sword Essence was several times stronger than the first one.

Even if you were a genuine Dao Master expert, you would very likely be terrified if you saw this Sword Essence.

Hardly had the Sword Essence emerged, Jian Wushuang directly guided it to fly in Ling Long’s direction to attack.

The tremendous Sword Essence pierced through the void and appeared behind Ling Long in a moment before it ruthlessly glided across the Exotic Beasts’ bodies with overwhelming power.

The Sword Essence was powerful, and the Exotic Beasts were only at the Eternal Realm. Therefore, it was really very easy to kill them.

With Jian Wushuang’s guidance, the Sword Essence glanced across all the Exotic Beasts, before its power finally dissipated completely.

They were decapitated and crashed down like raindrops. Blood filled the void, turning the gray fog into a bloody red.

“This is...”

Seeing what was happening behind her, Ling Long opened her eyes wide and then looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you.” Ling Long uttered the two words soundlessly, but Jian Wushuang knew what she said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and looked in the directions of Jiu Zui and Shui Jin.

He could no longer see Jiu Zui, but Shui Jin...

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s looked shocked.

He could see that many of the beasts had caught up with Shui Jin and were surrounding Shui Jin. Although he fought desperately, he could not withstand the attack of so many Exotic Beasts at the same time.

Just a moment later, Shui Jin was crushed by the beasts.

Shui Jin is dead!

Jian Wushuang was shocked, but he could do nothing but shake his head.

“I have done my best to help them. I can’t do anything else. Whether each can escape this disaster and leave the Stellar Fog Sea alive depends on their luck.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly.

The four of them had come together to the Stellar Fog Sea and took an adventure in the Impasse for a year, so of course, they had formed a connection.

If possible, Jian Wushuang would go to save them without hesitation. Even if it might cost him some trump cards, he would not regret it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, in this predicament, he could do nothing.

Just as he had said before, in this kind of situation they could only rely on their own life-saving abilities.

He thought no more of it. After all, the Exotic Beasts behind him had already caught up with him. He immediately took a deep breath and deployed his Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

When Jian Wushuang deployed the second level of Dragon Blood Secret Skill, the Spiritual Power in his entire body began to burn wildly. His speed suddenly increased a hundredfold, and soon he disappeared and the Exotic Beasts could no longer see him.
