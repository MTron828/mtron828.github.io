Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rumble.

Huge dark clouds gathered from all directions. The entire Firmament World suddenly became dark.

It was dark and misty.

Jian Wushuang sat in the void, right in the middle of the sea region. His eyes were still closed. Although he felt the changes in the surrounding universe, he didn’t move an inch.

At the very end of Firmament World, there were two figures standing side by side. They were Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao.

“It’s going to start,” Hall Master Yuan looked at the huge dark clouds gathered above Jian Wushuang’s head and his face grew solemn.

“He experienced nine sacred thunders during his first Inverse Cultivation Test. The last one was a combination of a thunder test, fire test and mind test. His second Inverse Cultivation Test should be stronger than his first and it is supposedly aimed at his state of mind. I wonder if Jian Wushuang can pass,” Lei Chao looked worried.

“No choice. As he is an Inverse Cultivator, he is destined to go through this test,” Hall Master sighed, “We have done what we could, we have prepared what we could. As for if he will pass in the end, it comes down to his own capability and his choices.”

“Inverse Cultivation…” Lei Chao shook his head in silence.

As the scariest Inverse Cultivation in Eternal Chaotic World, due to its abnormality, due to its quirkiness, the universe couldn’t tolerate it.

Above the sea, the dark clouds churned and covered most of Firmament World.

The surface area that the clouds covered was a few folds wider than when Jian Wushuang had gotten through his first Inverse Cultivation Test.

However, as the coverage of the dark clouds grew, there wasn’t much power within them.

Forget about the pressure – there wasn’t even one bit of destructive matter.

“This Inverse Cultivation Test is uncommon,” Hall Master Yuan’s pupil contracted.

“With such a huge coverage of clouds, there isn’t one bit of pressure or destructive manner,” Lei Chao looked solemn too. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In any ordinary cultivators’ God’s Test, there would be terrifying force and pressure as the clouds formed and the destructive matter would be strong too.

Just like Jian Wushuang’s first Inverse Cultivation Test, the power of the clouds was earth-shattering.

But now, the clouds for his second Inverse Cultivation test… There wasn’t any force or noise.

Even the two top experts, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao couldn’t tell the actual situation of the clouds. As it was unknown, it was even more dangerous.

Just then… Rumble!

There was suddenly a crack on the dark cloud in the middle. The crack grew huge at a terrifying speed and there was suddenly a cloud of dark mist that appeared in the crack.

The cloud of dark mist didn’t possess any sort of imposing or destroying manner but the moment it appeared it was enough to frighten any cultivator.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, who were watching at the edge of Firmament World, saw the cloud of dark mist and were shocked.

“It’s here!”

Splash! The cloud of dark mist covered Jian Wushuang’s body like a flowing light. Jian Wushuang couldn’t dodge it all and let the cloud of dark mist cover him.

The enormous amount of dark mist entered his body directly.

“The second Inverse Cultivation Test is finally here?”

When Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, there was a sharp light in them. There wasn’t any terror, only absolute calmness.

“Such a creepy feeling.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. He felt the dark mist enter his body but it didn’t cause any damage to his divine body. On the contrary, he felt rather comfortable and relaxed.

He indulged in the feeling.

Gradually, his consciousness became light.

He was in total calmness.

Deep sleep!

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness had entered a deep sleep straight away.

“Jian Wushuang! Jian Wushuang!”

King of Venomous Worms who lived in Jian Wushuang noticed his current situation and got a shock. He shouted with all his strength, trying to wake Jian Wushuang up.

However, regardless of how he shouted, Jian Wushuang didn’t react.

His consciousness was in a deep sleep. Unless he woke up soon, if someone came to kill him on the spot, he wouldn’t know.

Just as his consciousness fell into deep sleep, he closed his eyes again. Then, he looked calm and friendly, he was even smiling faintly.

The smile was very sincere.

Then, before King of Venomous Worms, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao’s shocked gaze, Jian Wushuang’s body was changing.

His body shrunk at a rapid speed, his skin grew fair and smooth, even his face became young and immature.

In a short period, Jian Wushuan became a kid that looked the age of eight or nine, and it continued.

From the age of eight or nine, he became five or six, then two or three, in the end… Jian Wushuang became a baby!

Yes, a baby! A little newborn.

“This, this…”

“Hall Master Yuan, Lei Chao and King of Venomous Worms in Jian Wushuang were astonished.

Rejuvenation wasn’t anything strange in Eternal Chaotic World.

Some elixirs and unique treasures could easily rejuvenate someone.

Even if one really rejuvenated. It was merely a change in appearance and his power and mind would remain the same.

However, Jian Wushuang in his second Inverse Cultivation Test had become a baby. Without any power, just an ordinary baby…

“He… what is he experiencing in his second Inverse Cultivation Test?” Hall Master Yuan couldn’t help but cry out.

Unbelievable. The sight before his eyes was unbelievable.

However, regardless of how unbelievable the sight was, they could only watch helplessly.

…

It was a huge estate. The estate looked just like the kind a rich family would have.

In the estate, there were many people walking back and forth. They looked anxious.

Soon…

“She gave birth! Sir, madam gave birth to a chubby boy!”

Along with a servant’s delighted scream from the room, the people walking back and forth along the estate looked surprised.

“Congratulations, Sir!”

“Congratulations, Sir!”

There were many who congratulated him.

“Haha, I have a son. I have a son!” The estate owner was extremely delighted.

“Sir, quickly think of a name for your son,” the butler urged.

“I decided on the name long ago. He will be called Mu Chen!” He chuckled.

“Mu Chen, it’s a nice name. Everyone, remember to take good care of Young Master Mu Chen from today onwards,” the butler instructed the surrounding servants.

“Yes sir,” the surrounding servants replied in unison.

“Haha, send my order down. Everyone in the Mu residence should be rewarded today,” the master of Mu residence announced.

The young master of Mu residence, Mu Chen, had been born!
