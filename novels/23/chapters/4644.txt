4645 Cause and Effect

Another Ancestor realm cultivator!

There should have only been two such godly existences that represented the entire universe and could materialize the entire universe.

However, now, five of them had appeared!

For the Void Universe, there was Void God, Devouring Emperor and Devour One. As for the Divine Power Universe, there was Cosmos God. And now, in the Cangwu Platform near the Spring of Chaos, the Qilin clan had actually given birth to another one?

Jian Wushuang felt that his thoughts were a mess.

Back then, when he was sitting in Enlightenment in the Cloud Palace, he had heard about the fate of the universe and the pinnacle of cultivation realms from Cosmos God.

In short, whether it was the Divine Power Universe or the Void Universe, only two Ancestor realm entities could be born.

In the vast universe, although there was a lot of divine power, there was only 10 percent of fate energy. The most crucial step for someone to reach the Ancestor realm was to grasp that 10 percent of fate energy that was scattered across the entire universe.

Cosmos God and Fengtian Patriarch were good examples.

Fengtian Patriarch was unable to break through to the Ancestor realm because Cosmos Gods had first comprehended that 10 percent of the fate energy in the universe.

The reason why there could only be one Ancestor realm expert in the entire universe was that no matter who it was, the moment they reached the Ancestor realm, they would become the controller of the order of the entire universe. They would become the guardian of the rules of the Great Dao.

The Ancestor realm, from a certain perspective, was equivalent to the representation of the universe.

Unless the previous Ancestor realm expert died, there was no possibility of a second Ancestor realm expert appearing under this Great Dao.

The peak of the universe was the Ancestor level. Jian Wushuang had believed in this without a doubt previously. This was because the rules and divine power that Cosmos God controlled were too vast. He could no longer think of any power that could surpass it.

However, after experiencing all the Great Catastrophe battles, Jian Wushuang’s thoughts completely changed.

Old Master and Devouring Emperor were obviously beyond the Ancestor realm.

Even a true Ancestor realm like Void God would not be able to cause any harm to Old Master.

Jian Wushuang seemed to be walking with a mist, and everything was pushing him forward in the hazy unknown.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and accepted the reality very quickly. At the same time, he was happy that an Ancestor realm expert had appeared in the Qilin clan. It would be an unimaginable impact on the war between the two universes.

Looking at Jian Wushuang, who had just come back to his senses, Lu Ding laughed again. “Palace Master Wushuang is a true Heaven’s Favorite. From your bone structure, I can tell that you’re not even a million years old.”

As soon as these words came out, both Lu Ting and Lu Gong sucked in a cold breath. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Judging from the previous battle, Jian Wushuang was the strongest person below the Ancestor level. He had killed a Half Ancestor with one super power attack, which left a deep impression in everyone’s mind.

They had thought that Jian Wushuang was an old monster who had cultivated with Zeus for countless chaos cycles, but he had only cultivated for 900,000 years?

What kind of genius was that to be able to reach such a stage? One must know that even the most ordinary descendant of their Qilin clan would need ten million years to hibernate once!

To be able to grow to such a level in less than one-tenth of the typical time spent in a dormant state, it only made one feel that all his years of cultivation had been wasted…

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s affirmation, even Lu Ding, who had already entered the Ancestor level, shook his head and smiled bitterly.

So there really were unparalleled geniuses in this world.

After that, Jian Wushuang explained in detail all the major events in the universe over the past hundreds of thousands of years to Lu Ding. Then, he cupped his hands and said goodbye.

He was eager to know the current situation of the Divine Power Universe.

He flew toward the bamboo house. Supreme Xue Bo had already woken up. White Ape, Long Yan, Long Chi, and Wu Jianxian were all sitting in meditation, trying to recover from their injuries as soon as possible.

Upon seeing Jian Wushuang, Supreme Xue Bo quickly stood up, but Jian Wushuang pressed him down on the bamboo bed. “Master Xue Bo, you don’t have to be so polite.”

“Palace Master Wushuang, we all thought that you had died and your Dao disappeared. It’s a blessing that we can see you again today.” Xue Bo’s eyes were slightly red as he spoke.

Jian Wushuang sighed with emotion. At the same time, he had some doubts. Based on his divine body and divine power consumption at that time, he could not withstand the full-power attack of Void God at all.

Old Master was also seriously injured by the sneak attack at that time, and he was also unable to resist.

Facing such a terrifying attack, one would definitely die. However, Jian Wushuang was fine. Even after he woke up, there was no sign of any hidden injuries on his body.

Jian Wushuang thought about it for a while and then threw it to the back of his mind.

Then, he began to ask about everything that had happened when he and Old Master had ‘died’.

Everyone’s calm and tragic death resurfaced in Jian Wushuang’s mind. All the geniuses of their respective eras had turned into bones in the desolate Offworld Battlefield. It was so depressing that Jian Wushuang could not breathe.

Everything that should not have happened, the old friends who should not have died, had all left.

Jian Wushuang already had an answer in his heart as to how to stop this scene from happening again.

When he heard that it was Lu Ding who had received the remnants of the entire Divine Power Universe after the battle of the Great Catastrophe War, Jian Wushuang also vaguely knew that he and Old Master had been received by Lu Ding when they were floating somewhere in the universe.

After hearing everything, Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice, “The day we recover from our injuries will be the day we can wield our swords again.”

Supreme Xue Bo never refuted Jian Wushuang’s words. He nodded firmly.

Jian Wushuang walked to another bamboo house after giving some instructions.

Leng Rushuang had been waiting outside the door. She had not closed her eyes for many years and she looked extremely haggard.

Jian Wushuang’s heart ached and he reached out to pull her into his arms.

“Husband, it’s all because I’m useless. That’s why Feng Qi had to pay such a big price to save me,” Leng Rushuang sobbed.

“Silly girl, it’s not your fault. It’s because of Matriarch Feng Qi’s righteousness that she was willing to sacrifice herself to save you.” Jian Wushuang wiped away her tears with his hand and said softly, “Don’t worry. I will definitely help Matriarch Feng Qi get out of danger.”

After leaving Leng Rushuang in Lan Lan’s care, Jian Wushuang quickly walked into the magic barrier set up by the descendant of the Phoenix clan.

As soon as he stepped on it, a scorching flame rose with the wind. Even the divine power in Jian Wushuang’s body felt a burning pain.

At this moment, the remaining 2,000 descendants of the Phoenix clan were all sitting on the ground.

The divine power of an ordinary Supreme expert at the very least formed a huge fire Phoenix with its wings spread out. Together, they drew a Nirvana Array Formation!

And in the center of this array core lay Feng Qi’s thin and weak figure.
