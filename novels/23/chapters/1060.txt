“You’re Jian Wushuang, that little lowborn bastard with weak bloodline and the son of an insignificant man from the Ancient World?”

Celestial Master Lei Yi’s cold words, obviously meant to humiliate Jian Wushuang, echoed throughout the drill ground.

The experts present were immediately swept into an uproar.

They never expected Lei Yi to respond with such insulting words.

The atmosphere instantly turned tense.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned icy-cold. He raised his head to stare at Lei Yi. “Old man, what… did you just say?”

“Didn’t you hear me? Let me repeat myself.” Lei Yi sneered before slowing down. “I called you little bas—”

He did not even finish his sentence.

“Bang!”

The ground under Jian Wushuang’s feet disintegrated as he leaped into the air.

Out of the blue, Lei Yi found himself surrounded by a terrifyingly strong Killing Intent.

A chilly, whistling wind penetrated his skin. He could already feel the stinging pain on his face.

Instead of panicking, he appeared delighted at this scene.

“Haha! What an idiot! We’re now at the inauguration ceremony for the new Supervisor! Here am I wondering how to kill him but he’s the one who’s starting the fight. This means the Supervisor can’t blame me even if I kill him. After all, I need to defend myself.”?Lei Yi sniggered as a purple long spear appeared in his hand.

The Purple Thunderbolt gathered around his spear. The thunderbolt, rolling and beating, gave off the dreadful and deadly aura.

Lei Yi’s eyes glinted as he watched Jian Wushuang approach and then directly thrust his spear at the latter.

This move awakened countless Purple Thunderbolts that flowed frantically in the air, tearing apart the Void around them. The Thunderbolts continued to gather and form a huge purple dragon with a wave of Lei Yi’s spear.

The dragon let out low howls and pounced on Jian Wushuang with its jaw wide open.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Killing Intent continued to gush out of Jian Wushuang’s body. The Sword Essence that soared into the sky and the power of three Sword Principle gathered in his sword.

He then furiously swung his sword.

The earth cracked, the Void shattered, and a tremendous Black Hole appeared.

The Black Hole expanded as it ruthlessly devoured everything around it. The experts on the drill ground were taken aback after seeing the sword light in Black Hole and swiftly stepped back to keep their distance from the battle.

“Boom!”

That ferocious dragon once again clashed with Jian Wushuang’s sword strike.

It was as if two stars had collided.

When the two powers collided, horrible waves and air currents frantically swept out in all directions.

The powers clashed violently the moment the sword shadow met the huge dragon made out of Purple Thunderbolts. No one could predict the outcome of this battle.

Finally, the dragon divided into innumerable Thunderboltsthat quickly dispersed. When the dragon disappeared, Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow also completely lost its power.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang stepped forward, his eyes glinting with killing intent.

He crossed tens of thousands of miles with a single step, bringing him in front of Lei Yi once again.

“Death Shadow!”

Jian Wushuang made a low bellow.

The crisp echo of the sword resounded, the sound as entrancing and melodious as water drops falling on the bamboo trees in the mountains.

A flash of sword light followed instantly.

“What’s this?”?Lei Yi frowned.

The moment he heard the echo of the sword, he detected that a terrifying consciousness attack was coming for him.

Not only was this consciousness attack quiet, but it was also overwhelming. There were three of them in total.

The attacks landed on Lei Yi the same time, eachone stronger than the one before it.

Lei Yi was a genuine Celestial Master with an iron will. Even so, his speed diminished significantly after the three consecutive consciousness attacks struck him.

When the beautiful sword shadow came, he could barely raise his spear and put it in front of himself.

“Clang!”

The low sound of a collision resounded. Lei Yi took a step backward.

“What a strange strike!”??Lei Yi was rather horrified.

“That blow is weird indeed. It consisted of three consciousness attacks that affect me silently. Fortunately, I have a strong will or I would’ve already been killed by his consciousness attacks and sword shadow.”

“How could he easily withstand my Heaven’s Bane and Death Shadow?”?Jian Wushuang wondered in surprise.

Jian Wushuang had made great progress in his Sword Principles and swordsmanship after cultivating in the Blood Asura Clan for 120 years.

Not only did he create the powerful and terrifying Bladed Surge, but he also greatly improved the power of Heaven’s Bane and Death Shadow.

For instance, he had improved Heaven’s Bane so that it was now stronger and swifter.

Death Shadow, on the other hand, had become even stranger, quieter, and faster.

In addition, Death Shadow’s consciousness attack had increased from one attack to three.

His consciousness attack was previously hidden in the sword light, whereby his enemy would suffer the attack only after seeing the sword light. Now, his attack was contained in the sword echo and could take effect even without the sword light.

Coupled with his current strength of Three-star Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God and the power of his three Sword Principles, the two techniques that he unleashed were certainly terrifyingly powerful. Yet, Lei Yi still managed to ward them off with ease.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned razor-sharp. Under the rapt attention of many experts, he launched another strike with an even stronger killing intent.

“Humph! Brat, don’t think too highly of yourself!”

With a deafening roar, another purple long spear emerged in Lei Yi’s hand.

He now had two purple long spears in hand, each of them surrounded by countless Purple Thunderbolts.
