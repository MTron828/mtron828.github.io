Chapter 3017: All the Strong Forces Have Arrived

——

Inside the towering shrine.

“Have you found him?”

Lord Wu, who was sitting upright on his chair, suddenly sat up. His eyes shone with a bright light. With a wave of his hand, a star map immediately appeared in front of him.

“He’s here.” Lord Wu pointed at a location on the star map. That location was not far from Blood Dipper City.

“It seems that my guess was right. He’s the Immortal Saint who just broke through in Blood Dipper City.” Lord Wu’s eyes turned cold. He picked up the token and tried to contact the person who had sent the message. However, after he sent the message…there was no response for a while.

“He’s dead. He must have been killed by that person.” Lord Wu’s voice was cold. Then he immediately sent Jian Wushuang’s location to all the experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, he ordered the surrounding experts to move toward that position as quickly as possible.

“Remember, all you have to do is make sure that he is in sight. Don’t let him escape again, but don’t rush up to fight him. This man is very strong. Without the battle strength of a rank three True Saint, it’s suicide to fight him.”

“Let’s go! Let’s go!”

In just a moment, more than ten figures rushed out of the towering temple and rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s position at the fastest speed.

In the void, these ten people were led by Lord Wu, and they were all very fast.

Lord Wu was holding a few communication tokens in his hands and receiving messages from all sides.

“Lord, we have arrived at the position you gave us and have seen that man.” A False Saint sent a message.

“You’ve seen him? He didn’t escape? He didn’t hide again?” Lord Wu asked.

“No. He just stood there quietly in the void. It seems like he’s waiting for us to arrive,” the False Saint said.

“He’s waiting for us? How is that possible? Are you sure that it’s his true body and not the corpse puppet like last time?” Lord Wu said with a frown. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I can’t be sure, but the aura he gives off is indeed that of a first rank True Saint,” the False Saint said.

“That should be true. You stay close and keep a close eye on him. We’ll be there soon,” Lord Wu said and then cut off the communication.

After the communication was cut off, Lord Wu’s expression became a bit strange. “He knows we’ve gone over, but he didn’t run away. Instead, he deliberately waited for us. Is he courting death?”

He really could not think of any reason why Jian Wushuang did not run away.

Was it because he had become an Immortal Saint that he did not need to fear them?

What a joke. Even if his strength would increase greatly after he upgraded from a Divine Master and became a rank one True Saint, his battle strength was already very close to that of a rank three True Saint. Even if he made a breakthrough now, he would at most have the true battle strength of a rank three True Saint.

A mere third rank True Saint battle strength was not enough to contend with them.

“Who cares. Since he wants to die, I’ll grant him his wish.” Lord Wu’s gaze turned cold as he looked at a person beside him.

This was a middle-aged man who wore a short shirt and had short golden hair.

This middle-aged man was tall and sturdy, but his aura was extremely cold.

“Your Highness, with our speed, we will be able to reach that person’s position in less than an hour, and our people have also sent news that that person is staying where he is and has not fled or hidden. Hence, we will have to trouble Your Highness to personally make a move later.” Lord Wu had a high and mighty attitude when he faced the others.

However, when faced with this middle-aged man with short golden hair, they did not dare to put on any airs.

Gold King was one of the arms that had followed the Magic Note King to conquer the world back then. In the heart of the Magic Note King, Gold King’s status was much higher than his.

Furthermore, Gold King’s strength was obvious. In the entire Magic Note Divine Kingdom, other than the Magic Note King, the strongest was the Gold King.

“I’ll make a move later.” Gold King looked indifferent and did not even look at Lord Wu.

Lord Wu just smiled awkwardly.

They were very fast. In less than an hour, they had arrived at Jian Wushuang’s position.

“He’s really there.”

From a distance, Lord Wu could see a figure wearing a gray robe and a gray mask.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A large number of figures stopped in the void less than 500 meters away from Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, many experts who had already arrived nearby also gathered. In total, there were more than 50 Immortal Saints gathered here, including more than 30 experts of the True Saint realm.

“More than 30 True Saints, and there are nearly 20 False Saints left. This lineup is really impatient.”

Jian Wushuang still stood in the void calmly, looking at the experts gathered in front of him. However, a faint smile appeared under his mask.

A trace of excitement and expectation rose in the depths of his heart.

“Sir, we have finally found you.” Lord Wu stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

“From what you mean, it seems that you have been looking for me for a long time?” Jian Wushuang smiled wickedly, and his voice was also quite wicked.

“Of course. In order to find you, I’ve mobilized 200,000 soldiers of the Magic Note Army and many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. I’ve searched this territory for more than 30 years and searched it many times,” Lord Wu said.

“That’s because you’re too stupid. I didn’t deliberately hide it,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was telling the truth. He really did not deliberately hide.

He had been openly staying in the Blood Dipper City and cultivating in seclusion. When someone came to the Blood Dipper City and asked him to accept the test of divine power, he accepted it.

But no one found him.

This time, if he did not show himself, it would probably take some time for the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom to find him.

“Humph, anyway, now that we have found you, it’s enough. You killed seven True Saint experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, including Divine Master Huocang, and then killed Tian Mound King and Stone Saint. Just now, our people found you and passed the information to me. There was no news from you. You must have killed them, right?” Lord Wu said coldly.

“That’s right. The four people who found me are all dead,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“You killed so many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. No matter what background you have, even if you are a genius disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, you will die today!” Lord Wu’s killing intent soared.

“Your Highness, let’s do it!”
