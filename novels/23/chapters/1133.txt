Chapter 1134: Blaze Quicksand Displays its Might

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll teach you how to respect your seniors!”

Even as Celestial Master Malignity’s voice echoed throughout Oblivion Palace, he was already making a dash forward.

He moved so swiftly that it felt as if the long distance was nothing. He appeared before Jian Wushuang in a flash. A dazzling arc of ice-cold sword light sliced through the void, aiming at Jian Wushuang almost instantly.

“His speed…”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Though he had been told that Celestial Master Malignity could be extremely fast, he was still astonished by the terrifying display of speed.

He had the battle prowess of Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm but he could not tell when Celestial Master Malignity drew his sword.

The cold sword light was coming for him. As much as he wanted to block the incoming attack, he could not react any further. He drew his Blood Mountain Sword to block it from piercing his chest.

“Clang!”

A deep crashing noise resounded as the power contained in the cold sword light sent him tumbling backward.

“Jian Wushuang, I haven’t even gone all-out against you yet.” Celestial Master Malignity’s voice resounded.

Jian Wushuang’s expression darkened. Suddenly, his pupils constricted in surprise.

He saw Celestial Master Malignity rushing out with a greater speed this time!

It was so fast that he could not hide his astonishment.

Once again, Celestial Master Malignity appeared before him and shot him with numerous beams of sword light. The sharp and cold sword lights flew out one after another.

Right then, it was as if Jian Wushuang had been trapped by the sea of sword light beams. They were everywhere with no gaps between the sword strikes.

“He moves quickly but his sword is even faster!”?Jian Wushuang’s heart pounded furiously as he waved his sword to fend off the attacks.

Likewise, he fully unleashed his Speed Sword Principle and swung his Blood Mountain Sword forward at an amazing speed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”

A series of crashing sounds filled the air like thunder.

“T-This…” Jian Wushuang eyes went wide with disbelief.

He thought that the Speed Sword Principle that he developed would surpass every other Celestial Master.

But now, Celestial Master Malignity’s swordsmanship was evidently much faster than his when fully unleashed.

It was now a competition of speed for them. Celestial Master Malignity evidently had the upper hand over Jian Wushuang. It was difficult enough to defend himself, never mind matching up to Celestial Master Malignity.

“I’m barely hanging on.”

Jian Wushuang wore a grave expression. One of the sword lights sent out by Celestial Master Malignity had gotten through the gap of his defense, stabbing towards his chest.

There was no way he could dodge it.

“Boom!”

The sharp sword light slammed into his chest and the immense force sent him tumbling backward. It took him a while to regain his balance.

Red Lotus smiled faintly when she saw this scene. “Sunrise Sword Emperor, you’re going to lose.”

“Be patient. The battle has just started. It’s too soon to tell,” Sunrise Sword Emperor replied coldly.

Red Lotus snorted. “You’re not convinced yet? Well, let’s see how Jian Wushuang will play the game.”

Inside Oblivion Palace, Celestial Master Malignity turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, is that all you’ve got?”

Celestial Master Malignity smirked and said disdainfully, “I heard that you killed a number of Celestial Master experts of the Jin Kingdom during a battle in the Loyalty Palace. Perhaps they were all just a bunch of rubbish? If you encounter a stronger opponent, I guess that you’ll have no choice but run away.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Celestial Master Malignity’s speed is indeed incredible. It’s no surprise that his speed ranked first among everyone in the Green Fire Palace. Although I’ve managed to develop the Swordplay of Speed, I still can’t match him in speed.”?He shook his head.

He knew that he lagged behind in terms of speed. The fact that there was no obstruction in Oblivion Palace also gave his opponent a better advantage. If Celestial Master Malignity were to maintain such speed, there would be nothing that he could do. Eventually, he would be defeated.

Suddenly, a smirk spread across his face.?“There is no doubt that I’ll be crushed if I fought Celestial Master Malignity before, but now…”

“Jian Wushuang, behave yourself and take this!” Celestial Master Malignity howled in a low voice.

He swiftly dashed into motion again. His figure appeared to be an illusionary Flowing Light going through the void. His speed was unprecedented that none of the Celestial Masters of Exceptional Realm could match up to. Other ordinary Celestial Masters could not even think about it.

Celestial Master Malignity was peerless even if his opponents were Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm.

Unfortunately, his rival was Jian Wushuang this time.

Seeing that Celestial Master Malignity had dashed toward him again, Jian Wushuang flipped his arm, and a golden gourd appeared in his hand.

“Oh?” Celestial Master Malignity’s expression flickered. He had noticed Jian Wushuang’s action but paid no heed to it.

Meanwhile, outside Oblivion Palace, the mere sight of the golden gourd caused Master Red Lotus’ pupils to constrict. “That is…”

Holding the golden gourd in hand, Jian Wushuang pulled the cork with the strength of his thought. A wave of terrifying power immediately erupted from the gourd.

As it rumbled, seemingly endless quicksand surged out from the opening of the gourd. The quicksand carried a blue flame and contained enormous power. It swiftly swept across the surroundings and engulfed the entire Oblivion Palace in no time.

The Blaze Quicksand pervaded the entire area of the vast void of Oblivion Palace.

“W-What’s this?”

Celestial Master Malignity quickly halted to a stop. He frowned and looked around at the vast expanse of Blaze Quicksand. A bad feeling instantly loomed over him.

Jian Wushuang grinned. A wild wind was raving under his control. Suddenly, the Blaze Quicksand turned into a sandstorm, blasting towards Celestial Master Malignity.

“Crap.”

Celestial Master Malignity’s face took on a ghastly expression. He tried to move away to dodge the sandstorm.

Soon, he found out that the sandstorm was unavoidable. It blasted out in all directions, sweeping through any obstacle barring its path. No matter where he went, the sandstorm would emerge in front of him and surged towards him. Celestial Master Malignity wielded his longsword recklessly, sending out brutal Sword Essence one after another. He continued struggling against the sandstorm.

Suddenly, a ruthless sword light was unleashed by Celestial Master Malignity, ripping up the sandstorm before him.

As soon as the sandstorm was broken, a figure charged at him. It was Jian Wushuang.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Jian Wushuang wore a cold expression. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand unleashed a terrifying burst of power, getting closer and closer to his opponent.

“Humph!”

Celestial Master Malignity snorted, and immediately wielded his sword to fend off the attack.

“Boom!”

Celestial Master Malignity was sent flying backward following the loud explosion. He then slammed into the sandstorm behind him.
