Chapter 1174: Failure!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The power of the first axe had just been displayed and the burly man wielded his axe toward Jian Wushuang again immediately.

It was overwhelming as well and left no chance for Jian Wushuang to breathe.

The move “Heaven’s Bane” Jian Wushuang had just executed barely withstood the burly man’s first blow. When his axe hacked toward him again, he only had the time to hold the Blood Mountain Sword across his chest…

Bang!

A loud noise rang out accompanied by a muffled snort let out by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang flew backwards due to the impact. He continually rolled during the process and managed to regain his balance after quite a while.

The burly man stood in the dark Void. He put the Giant Axe behind him and his eyes closed again.

“I’m defeated!”

Jian Wushuang looked up at the burly man in front of him, but he still felt unbelievable.

He knew the ultimate test of Star Island was extremely difficult, but he did not expect it to be so tough.

It was aimed at Celestial Masters, but he actually possessed the genuine battle strength of a Universe Master.

As a result, he failed to resist the two blows from that burly man.

“Although it’s a test that is designed for Celestial Masters apparently, ordinary Universe Masters cannot pass it. Anyone who wants to pass it must possess the battle strength at the Peak of Universe Master Level.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

After a brief confrontation, he had a general understanding of the strength of this Puppet Fighter.

The Puppet Fighter must have reached the Peak of Universe Master Level and be no weaker than Red Snow King, who had pursued him on the battlefield.

“Let a Celestial Master defeat a Peak Universe Master?” Jian Wushuang gasped in shock. At the same time, he secretly admired,?“It is worthy of being the test set by the founder of the Star Bloodline. It’s really demanding.”

“It seems that it’s impossible for ordinary geniuses to pass this test and join the Star Palace.”

The Star Bloodline only selected two kinds of disciples.

The first type were ordinary disciples who just needed to pass the test of a black tower. Jian Wushuang and Star King were now merely ordinary disciples.

The second type were disciples of the Star Palace. Anyone who wanted to be this type was required to pass the ultimate test.

What Jian Wushuang did not know was that the Star Bloodline was also an overlord in the Eternal Chaotic World. Members of the Star Bloodline who were able to join the Star Palace were extremely rare. If ordinary geniuses could join the Star Palace, weren’t its disciples could be seen everywhere on the street?

“My current strength barely reaches the Universe Master Level. There is still a long way to go before it reaches the Peak of Universe Master Level. I assume it would be unrealistic to pass the ultimate test any time soon.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head and then left there.

Many Warriors who had been trapped on Star Island were waiting outside the black tower with a look of strong desire and expectation.

They had been trapped on this island for so long that they were anxious to go out.

At this point, Jian Wushuang walked out of the black tower.

“He is coming out!”

“Haven’t he just entered it? Why did he come out so soon?”

“Did he pass the ultimate test?”

A large number of Warriors swarmed forward.

“Blood Mountain!”

“Blood Mountain!”

Ling Long, Qian Yu, Zi Dong, Dao Master Kong Ming, and Dao Master Thousand Water were foremost among the Warriors. They looked at Jian Wushuang with eyes filled with anticipation.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you.” Jian Wushuang said apologetically.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the Warriors on the scene all altered.

“After all, it’s the ultimate test of Star Island. Therefore, it’s not so easy to get through.” Dao Master Thousand Water said first in a resonant voice, “Everybody, we mustn’t be too hasty. Take our time.”

“Blood Mountain, you didn’t get through the ultimate test this time, but I believe you must have witnessed its difficulty. Do you have any confidence?” Dao Master Thousand Water asked.

“Confidence?” Jian Wushuang froze. Looking at so many expectant faces, he couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said solemnly, “Yes, of course. Although the ultimate test is extremely difficult, I still have a way to pass it. However, it takes some time.”

“Haha, great. As for time, anyway, we’ve been trapped here for so long and don’t care about it. How long do you need? Ten thousand years? A hundred thousand years?” Dao Master Thousand Water asked repeatedly.

“I don’t know.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “But I’ll try my best at any rate.”

Hearing that, Dao Master Thousand Water and other people exchanged glances. Later, he said, “Don’t put too much pressure on yourself, just do your best. Sometimes, the more pressure, the less progress.”

“Everybody, let’s go.”

“Blood Mountain, you just need to work hard. If there is anything we can help, don’t hesitate to let us know. Inform us the next time you’re ready for the ultimate test.”

After finishing speaking that, he left directly.

The Warriors on Star Island departed as well.

While they were leaving, Jian Wushuang could clearly see the disappointment in their eyes.

However, he was unable to do anything with that. He couldn’t make any promise except for doing his utmost.

After everyone had left.

“Blood Mountain, are you sure you’ll pass the ultimate test?” Qian Yu, Jian Wushuang’s friend, asked seriously.

“I’m kind of confident about that.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He was indeed confident.

Although the ultimate test was incredibly difficult, he still had a little bit of confidence in his ability.

“The battle strength at the Peak of Universe Master Level… My strength is really far behind that level, but I can reach it as long as time allows.”?Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

There was enough room for the improvement of his current strength.

His Sword Principles… Only one of them reached the most powerful level.

As for the Speed Sword Principle and Yin-Yang Sword Principle, they were still at the Creation Level. He could still upgrade them. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As long as one of them reached the most powerful level, his strength would naturally skyrocket. In addition, his Ancient God Power already reached the Three-star Peak. He reckoned that it wouldn’t be long before his strength broke through to the Four-star Ancient God Level.

Once his strength reached that level, his power would increase by leaps and bounds. Naturally, his overall strength would follow suit.

“Currently, I only need to upgrade either the Speed Sword Principle or the Yin-Yang Sword Principle to the most powerful level and improve my Ancient God Power so that it breaks through to the Four-star Ancient God Level. In this way, my battle strength ought to reach the Peak of the Universe Master Level. At that time, chances are that I am able to pass the ultimate test!”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands and his sharp eyes emanated horrifying light.
