Chapter 2900: Rewards

——

“Of course, there are rewards. Moreover, there are quite a lot of rewards,” The Bone Emperor explained with a smile.

“There are a total of three ways to obtain benefits in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. The first one is to carry out the different levels of missions issued by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Most of these missions are richly rewarded. These rewards are far more than the rewards given by some of the employment organizations in the absolute beginning divine realm. Unfortunately, however, most of these missions are incomparably difficult. Moreover, the chances of failure or even death are extremely high.”

“I have been an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance for a long time, but I have only accepted three earth-level missions in the past few years. Each of these three earth-level missions required me to go through life and death, and I was lucky enough to complete two of them. As for the third mission, I didn’t complete it at all, but I was lucky enough to save my life. However, because of the lingering fear, I haven’t accepted any earth-level missions until now.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

To get a sufficient reward, he had to pay more.

Since the rewards of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s missions were so great, the difficulty was naturally higher.

“The second way to get benefits depends on luck.” The Bone Emperor smiled slightly. “The divine beginning realm is very big and vast, far beyond our imagination. As one of the most mysterious alliances in the divine beginning realm, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance also has various conflicts of interests. Moreover, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance often encounters some unexpected incidents. Once there are unexpected incidents, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can’t mobilize other experts to rush over in a short time, so they can only send nearby Heaven-cleaving Alliance members.

“In such an emergency, the members who are temporarily dispatched will receive more benefits than those who complete difficult tasks. If they are lucky, such an emergency can be easily solved without too much trouble.”

“Many members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance know about this, so they hope that an emergency will occur in their territory and the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will take the initiative to find them. There is a rumor in the outside world that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can gather at least three Immortal Saints in any territory or corner of the divine beginning world as long as the Heaven-cleaving Alliance gives the order. It’s true.”

Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

The absolute beginning divine realm was vast and had countless territories. The Golden Crow Nine Realms was probably just a drop in the ocean compared to the entire beginning divine realm. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, in so many territories, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was able to take care of at least three Immortal Saints in the shortest time in any corner. This ability was probably unparalleled in the entire absolute beginning divine realm.

However, the reason why the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was able to make these Immortal Saints arrive at the fastest time was that they had paid a huge price.

“Other than these two channels, there is one last way to obtain benefits from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. That is to introduce other experts to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. As long as this person passes the test of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and becomes a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the person who introduces him will receive a certain reward.”

“This is the safest way. You Don’t have to take any risks. As long as you have a unique vision and the person who recommended you is really capable, it will be fine,” The Bone Emperor said.

“This method is indeed weak, but if you only recommended one person to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the reward should not be too much. How can it be worth a heaven-sealing painting scroll?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Haha, if it’s just an ordinary genius, it’s not worth it, but you are different.” The Bone Emperor smiled.

“Jian Yi, you may not know this, but there are different levels of members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. First, there are the most common members. These ordinary members are almost made up of Invincible Divine Masters who have passed the assessment, including some Immortal Saints who are of average strength.”

“Second, there are earth-rank members. Like me, I am an earth-rank member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, earth-rank members are very common, but they more or less have a certain level of strength.”

“Above the earth-rank is the heaven-rank. Cultivators at this level almost all have an immortal body, and they have special methods. They are very powerful Immortal Saints. Even I am unable to reach this level now. After all, I have only completed two earth-rank missions alone. Only after I have completed all three earth-rank missions can I truly become a heaven-rank member.”

“Above the heaven rank, there is the emperor rank!”

“The emperor rank members are made up of a group of top experts. Most of them are top-notch Immortal Saints, and some of them are invincible among the Immortal Saints. It is said that there are even a few rule masters who are also emperor rank members. At this level, they are also true experts in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and can definitely command a side!”

“However, whether it’s the earth, heaven, or emperor level, they are just the periphery of the heaven-cleaving union. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance has no restrictions on them. They are completely free regardless of their strength. However, it is rumored that there is a ‘primitive level’ above the emperor level, which is the true core level of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Any one of them has the strength and means to destroy the world, and because of the existence of a group of primitive experts, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is so powerful in the divine beginning world.”

Jian Wushuang listened carefully.

Although he had heard Saint Crimson Rock mention the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he did not know much about it.

As a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Bone Emperor knew more about it.

Jian Wushuang did not know about the ordinary, earth, heaven, emperor, and core primitive level. He did not know about it until Bone Emperor said so.

“Jian Yi, you are only a Divine Master now. If you use the heaven-cleaving token to participate in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment, even if you pass the assessment, you will only be an ordinary member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Such a reward is indeed not much. It is not worth exchanging a heaven-sealing scroll for.”

“But what I value is your great potential!”

Bone Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“In the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, I saw the battle between you and the Three Realm Masters. Your ability, your swordsmanship, and even your treasures far exceed that of a Divine Master. Such strength is more than enough for you to become an ordinary member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. If you are lucky, you can become an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance at the Divine Master level.”

“Once you become an earth-rank member, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will reward me even more

“In other words, the higher your rank is in the future, the more benefits I will get.”
