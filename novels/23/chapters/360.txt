Chapter 361: Challenging the Holy Steps

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang!”

“He had disappeared for a year. Now he suddenly showed up again? He even came to our Holy Emperor Palace!”

“He’s actually attacking our palace on his own. How dare he!”

The Palace Master of Holy Emperor Palace coldly stared at Jian Wushuang, who was standing on the Holy Steps with a soaring Sword Essence.

Though he said those words, the Palace Master did not dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang’s power. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Go inform the four Holy Masters. Be quick,” the Palace Master ordered.

They immediately followed his order.

Jian Wushuang looked indifferent, as did his two Sword Soul Phantoms.

Ignoring the great shock in their eyes, Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared at the great palace gate. Then, he stepped on the second step.

Crack!

The second step instantly cracked while the first step ruptured.

Jian Wushuang’s aura was already quite strong. Yet, as he took the second step, his aura soared once again.

Then he continued, stepping onto the third step...

All the spectators fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

Outside of Holy Emperor Island, a void suddenly appeared and a huge wormhole formed.

It was created by the Space-travel Spell.

The Space-travel Spell was rare and precious in the Nanyang Continent. Normally, even top sects were unwilling to use it, but they made an exception today.

A dozen figures walked out of the wormhole.

They all had great auras. A middle-aged man in a purple robe led these Saint Realm experts. He was the Alchemy School Sect Master, Wang Yan.

Wang Yuan was also here.

“Let’s go!”

The experts of the Alchemy School left for Holy Emperor Island.

Besides the Alchemy School, the three valleys and four temples, and the eight sects also received the news. They all came here using Space-travel Spells.

There were even some solitary experts.

The Wine Master arrived with his disciple, Yang Zaixuan.

After a while, countless experts had gathered near Holy Emperor Island. They all watched Jian Wushuang walking on the Holy Steps.

Many young Warriors, who took part in the selection for Holy Emperor Palace, looked at those experts in shock.

“So many experts!”

“I don’t feel any aura from many of them. They must be experts of the Saint Realm!”

“So many Saint Realm experts!”

The young Warriors were stunned.

Saint Realm experts were top experts in the Nanyang Continent. Even a large sect only had a few of them. It was rare to meet such an expert, but now...

There were more than 50 Saint Realm experts suspended in the sky.

What did that mean?

Had that happened before on the Nanyang Continent?

All of this was because of one person.

That person was Jian Wushuang!

“Third Brother!”

Wang Yuan had a serious expression as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“A man with a sword dared to attack Holy Emperor Palace. No matter what happens, his courage will leave a mark in the history of the Nanyang Continent.” Wang Yan wore a faint smile with a flicker of craftiness in his eyes.

Two figures stood side by side at a corner of the group.

“You are not going to help your brother?” Wine Master asked casually.

“I am not able to help him with my current strength,” Yang Zaixuan replied.

“Oh, you do know yourself.” Wine Master had a faint smile on his face as he replied.

On the Holy Steps, Jian Wushuang had not stopped climbing. Every time he took a step, his aura would increase a bit. When he stepped onto the 50th step, his aura was strong enough to shock everyone that was present.

Four figures appeared at the palace gate. They were the backbone of Holy Emperor Palace, the Four Holy Masters.

“He is Jian Wushuang?” A silver-haired elder narrowed his eyes and looked toward Jian Wushuang. He was First Holy Master.

“That’s him.” Second Holy Master stood beside First Holy Master and stared at his enemy with a hint of ferociousness in his eyes.

As an overlord of Nanyang, Holy Emperor Palace had abundant resources, so they had Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixirs. After the last fight at Skyward Mountain, Second Holy Master ate a Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir, allowing him to regrow his severed legs completely.

“His aura seems much stronger than a year ago,” Second Holy Master said coldly, but he was shocked.

A year ago, Jian Wushuang split his magic weapon and cut off his legs. The battle strength he released at that time was already frightening. However, now the boy’s aura had terrified him.

“It’s only been a year, but his strength improved yet again?” First Holy Master’s face fell. He immediately gave an order. “Activate the Protective Array!”

“The Protective Array?” Many of the experts in Holy Emperor Palace were stunned.

The Protective Array of Holy Emperor Palace would only be activated when Holy Emperor Palace faced a big crisis and was not able to fight. But now, they activated the Protective Array just because of Jian Wushuang.

“Go, right now,” First Holy Master shouted.

“Yes.” The expert did not dare to disobey his order and immediately went to activate the Protective Array.

After a while, a surge of great power rose from the palace and a transparent energy barrier appeared in front of the palace gate.

“Protective Array?”

“Holy Emperor Palace activated their Protective Array?”

“How could that be possible?”

A large number of spectators froze in shock.

Activating the Protective Array represented that Holy Emperor Palace was facing a powerful enemy.

But, at the moment, Jian Wushuang was here by himself and had not made a move.

“Only he himself was strong enough to force Holy Emperor Palace to activate their Protective Array! That’s Jian Wushuang!” The younger warriors’ eyes sparkled as they felt the blood racing through their veins.

Jian Wushuang still continued slowly climbing the Holy Steps.

Eventually, he reached the 108th step and appeared in front of the palace gate.
