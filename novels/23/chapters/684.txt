“My name is Jian Wushuang, and I have been tasked with killing Bing Ji for you,” Jian Wushuang declared.

“Oh.” He Yun nodded his head, obviously a little underwhelmed.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang couldn’t stop his face becoming darker.

He couldn’t help but notice the look of despair on the faces of the people looking back at him.

“These people don’t take me seriously because I’m a Skyscraping Realm cultivator?”

“But they’re right. After all, I need to kill an advanced Divine Realm expert. It’s hard to imagine a Skyscraping Realm cultivator slaying an advanced Divine Realm expert, so it’s understandable that they have little faith.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

At this moment, a novice Divine Realm expert in the crowd took one look at Jian Wushuang and curled his lips, then muttered, “He’s merely at the Skyscraping Realm, but takes slaying Bing Ji so flippantly. It seems disciples from the Ancient Sect aren’t quite what we thought. Unfortunate, I had high hopes for the Ancient Sect, but it would seem the Ancient Sect is just so-so.”

The voice of the novice Divine Realm expert was little more than a whisper, but still Jian Wushuang heard what he said.

Instantly, the look in Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned to a steely gaze as the essence of the sword became obvious.

Boom... The essence of the sword suddenly seemed to envelop the whole world and it was as though time stood still.

“What is it?”

“Such a terrible essence!”

“It’s just too strong!”

“I’ve seen a top Devine Realm expert, knowledgeable in Sword Principle, display his skills, though even his essence wasn’t as violent as this!”

The Divine Realm experts, who had almost felt hopeless suddenly began to take notice, shocked.

They could feel the obvious power held by this sword.

The novice Divine Realm expert who had spoken so freely earlier now had a look of terror on his face. His eyes full of fear as he stared at Jian Wushuang. Frozen in place, he dared not move for fear that this young man in front of him, whom he had so underestimated, would kill him in an instant.

He now had no doubt that the person stood in front of him possessed the ability to kill him with little effort. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But clearly this man was merely a Skyscraping Realm cultivator.

He didn’t know Jian Wushuang was just at the Skyscraping Realm, but the latter had not only created Sword Heart but completely consolidated his ability at the first level of Sword Heart through six years of meditation in Sword Mountain. This made Jian Wushuang stronger than many Eternal Realm experts who specialized in Sword Principle. The power and essence contained within his sword could easily slay novice Divine Realm experts and even intermediate Divine Realm experts.

“I have come to complete a task. If you don’t cooperate, you too will suffer the consequences.” Jian Wushuang’s voice became cold.

“Misunderstanding. This is a mere misunderstanding, Lord.” He Yun immediately changed his attitude, and even his tone had become humble and respectful.

From what Jian Wushuang had just displayed, he could see that Jian Wushuang retained battle strength far beyond that of an ordinary Skyscraping Realm cultivator. His strength at the very least was more than his own and possibly even much stronger. Hope among the other Divine Realm experts had been rekindled.

“Lord, how will you deal with Bing Ji?” He Yun asked in a low voice.

“That’s none of your business. I have my own way of killing him.” Jian Wushuang didn’t bother to engage in small talk.

“Fine.” He Yun nodded. “Bing Ji gave the few families here a day to prepare Divine Gems. Barring a miracle, he will be here tomorrow to kill us all. Please take this opportunity to kill him, Lord.”

“There is no need to wait until tomorrow. Take me to see him today!” Jian Wushuang ordered.

On the way, he had carefully studied the information he had on the eleven Divine Experts who he would kill. He had paid special attention to Hu Hu, the strongest among them for he was confident of killing the others with ease.

Furthermore, he only had two months and a lot of time would be used up just finding these Divine Realm experts. Therefore he had no time to waste.

“Today?” He Yun was shocked. After contemplating this request, he nodded in agreement. “Okay, Lord, follow me please.”

With that, he led Jian Wushuang to where Bing Ji was.

The experts from the other families glanced at each other before following them.

Before long, He Yun and Jian Wushuang were in front of a towering building. The building was once home to the largest shop in Dan Yang City, but now it was occupied solely by Bing Ji. Bing Ji and his underlings gathered here regularly.

“Lord, Bing Ji is right in this building.” It was obvious that He Yun was a little nervous.

“Mmm.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had noticed a strong aura coming from inside the building, which he knew must belong to Bing Ji.

“Master He, I assume you have thought it through and are here today to give our lord the Divine Gems?”

A sneering voice was heard, and with that, some figures flew out of the building, headed by a middle-aged man with an evil scowl and a grim smile spread across his face. His aura made it known that he was an intermediate Divine Realm expert.

“This is Yuan Qian, an expert serving under Bing Ji. Many years ago he had a falling out with the He family. He was then hunted by my family and fled to other cities. Now he is the strongest among the Divine Realm experts serving under Bing Ji,” He Yun whispered into Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“Oh.” Jian Wushuang replied nonchalantly. It was clear he didn’t take this intermediate Divine Realm expert seriously.

“Jian Wushuang, an Ancient Sect disciple, comes to slay Bing Ji under orders.” Jian Wushuang spoke clearly and his voice thundered throughout the whole of Dan Yang City.

“What did you say?”

Upon hearing this, the expressions of Yuan Qian and the Divine Realm experts serving under Bing Ji changed.

“An Ancient Sect disciple?”

Yuan Qian looked at Jian Wushuang intensely. But when he perceived Jian Wushuang’s aura was merely at the Skyscraping Realm, his expression lightened.

“Ha ha ha...” Yuan Qian laughed as though he had just heard the best joke in the world. He stared at Jian Wushuang, with a hint of ridicule in the eyes. “Boy, what did you just say? Did you say you’re here under orders to kill our lord? Am I hearing this correctly?”

“Boy, repeat what you have just said!”

The Bing Ji underlings all looked at Jian Wushuang as if they were looking at a fool.

The presence of an Ancient Sect disciple was indeed a big deal and certainly something for them to worry about.

But this Ancient Sect disciple in front of them was merely a Skyscraping Realm cultivator. This Skyscraping Realm cultivator had threatened to kill their lord Bing Ji, an advanced Divine Realm expert?

Surely this was a joke?

However, it was obvious that Jian Wushuang was not one inclined to repeat himself.

The Emperor Sword was already in his hand and he began to wave his weapon.
