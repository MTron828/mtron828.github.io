Chapter 2401: Entering The Saint’s Tomb

“That one over there is Wu Ming, one of the Twelve Minor Kings. He has some strange tricks up his sleeves.”

“The little girl squatting on the ground looks very weak but don’t underestimate her. She is ranked fifth among the Twelve Minor Kings, Hong Luo!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“And that one...”

Elder Wujian introduced the Twelve Minor Kings that were present to Jian Wushuang one by one.

He also did not leave out some famous geniuses who were not part of the Twelve Minor Kings.

Jian Wushuang paid attention to them.

He had never walked around in the Wusha Wilderness and had little knowledge about the top geniuses of various sects in Wusha Wilderness.

Take the Twelve Minor Kings, for example, he had only met Bai Tao before. He knew nothing about the rest. He had now gained quite some information about them from Elder Wujian.

At that very moment, a loud buzzing sound emerged!

A large group of figures appeared on the glade with the help of spatial passages.

The large group of figures appeared and instantly attracted the attention of everyone present. Even the Twelve Minor Kings looked at the group of people.

“Great Compassion Sect. People from the Great Compassion Sect are here!”

“There are so many of them. There must be around 30 to 40 of them, right?”

“The number of slots to the tomb given to each sect was based on the strength of their sects. The top sects have about ten places. However, the Great Compassion Sect is the best of all, hence they have 30 slots!”

Many people started whispering on the glade and they all enviously looked in the direction of the Great Compassion Sect.

They were the best sect in the Wusha Wasteland. Most geniuses were eager to be part of them, but they were unable to find an opportunity so they could only join the other sects.

“Wow. There are 30 genius disciples, but amongst them, nine are First-Class Divine Demons!”

“Look, look at those four people...”

Someone was heard yelling in a deep voice.

The genius disciples of various sects on the glade were all staring at the four lead disciples of the Great Compassion Sect.

The four of them consisted of three men and one woman.

The four of them stood side by side and attracted much attention. The other geniuses present seemed to have lost their footings before them.

“Those four people are the ‘Twelve Minor Kings’ of the Great Compassion Sect, right?” asked Jian Wushuang.

When he was residing in the Anjiu Commandery, in an event by Anjiu Commandery Governor Baiyue, he heard that the Great Compassion Sect was a place where top geniuses of the Wusha Wilderness gathered. It was such that the Great Compassion Sect alone had four members in the Twelve Minor Kings!

Elder Wujian nodded. “It’s them. The Great Compassionate Sect’s overall strength and genius disciples’ ranks are better than other sects. Four of the Twelve Minor Kings belong to the Great Compassionate Sect. The four of them are ranked the eighth, sixth, third, and first among the Twelve Minor Kings!”

“The other three are easier to handle, but Tu Qiancheng, who is ranked first among the Twelve Minor Kings, was an exceptional super genius. He’s much better than the others and shines bright even among them. Among the younger generation of Wusha Wilderness, he was peerless. Even though the Wusha Wilderness is producing geniuses, those geniuses are nothing in front of him.”

“Is he that remarkable?” Jian Wushuang had his eyes fixed on the strong man with his hands folded and his eyes closed.

That strong man was Tu Qiancheng.

At that moment, not only Jian Wushuang but many other geniuses were watching him intentionally or unintentionally. Although many of them had a sense of competitiveness shooting up in them, they quickly suppressed their thoughts after their reasonings kicked in.

The top genius in Wusha Wilderness, Tu Qiancheng was not someone anybody could challenge.

Not even the Twelve Minor Kings were qualified.

“If I’m not mistaken, this Tu Qiancheng has now reached Peak Stage Divine Demon, right? As such, he shouldn’t be able to enter the Saint’s Tomb, right?” said Jian Wushuang suddenly.

He had already noticed the aura on Tu Qiancheng. Tu Qiancheng, too, did not try to constrain his aura. He was indeed beyond the First-Class Divine Demons.

“Hmm, he probably has just broken through recently. Once he achieved the Peak Stage Divine Demon Realm, he’s no longer a younger generation disciple. He wouldn’t be able to enter the Saint’s Tomb. It’s strange why he did not suppress his realm first and breakthrough when the tomb opened?” Elder Wujian frowned.

“Who knows, maybe he doesn’t care about the opportunities in the tomb at all?” Jian Wushuang jeered.

“Perhaps. Before Tu Qiancheng broke through, he used to kill a Peak Stage Divine Demon head-on with his First-Class Divine Demon identity. Now that he has broken through the Peak Stage Divine Demon, I supposed he’s now matchless among the Peak Divine Demon of the Wusha Wilderland,” said Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang’s face flickered.

‘Can a First-Class Divine Demon kill a Peak Stage Divine Demon head-on?’

No wonder he was called the top genius in the Wusha Wilderness.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be discouraged. You are more talented than Tu Qiancheng,” said Elder Wujian again.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was comparable to the Second-Class Divine Demons in his Early Stages Chaotic Realm. His abilities were much higher against Tu Qiancheng.

Jian Wushuang smiled at Elder Wujian’s words.

At the glade, the genius disciples of the various sects have gathered.

“It’s almost time. Let’s open the Saint’s Tomb.”

A fellow elder from the Great Compassion Sect spoke.

The experts who led the other sects nodded in unison.

Under the cooperation of many powerful experts, eight huge spatial wormholes soon appeared in front of everyone.

“Eight wormholes?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“The Saint’s Tomb is an independent space of its own. These eight spatial wormholes are all going to the different areas of the tomb’s outer area. This is good. After all, the Purple Amulets are scattered in the outer area. It works better if disciples of various sects are scattered all over the places,” said Elder Wujian.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded.

With the emergence of eight spatial wormholes, the genius disciples of the various sects were getting ready to enter the tomb.

Over at the Great Compassion Sect.

“As in previous sessions, the Great Compassion Sect will be divided into three teams and enter the tomb through three spatial wormholes. Junior brothers, you three will each lead a team,” said Tu Qiancheng in a deep voice.

“Yes.”

Three of the Minor Kings who stood by him respectfully nodded.

Many disciples of the Great Compassion Sect were the first to step into the spatial wormhole while some of the remaining top sects followed closely behind.

“Let’s go!” said Zhong Yi, who led Narcissus Island.

Hence, ten disciples of Narcissus Island, including Jian Wushuang, also stepped into one of the spatial wormholes.
