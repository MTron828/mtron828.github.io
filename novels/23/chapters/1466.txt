Chapter 1467: Heartless

The experts under the control of Blood Emperor were searching for his whereabouts madly and Jian Wushuang naturally could only opt to live in seclusion.

“Back when I was wandering around with King Luo Zhen, I learnt many methods. The hiding method that I’m going to teach you, although it isn’t considered too high of a level in Eternal Chaotic World, should be sufficient for you,” King of Venomous Worms said, “After learning this method, even Real God who probes using consciousness in the region wouldn’t be able to feel your existence, let alone those ordinary Real Gods who briefly cover the range with simple consciousnesses.”

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately started to cultivate the hiding method that King of Venomous Worms had provided him with.

The level of the method wasn’t high. Jian Wushuang would be able to master it very soon with his capability. Relying on the method, Jian Wushuang hid his aura entirely.

Soon, Jian Wushuang realized that there was consciousness that swept past him.

“Someone’s here and it should be a Real God,” Jian Wushuang said softly, “There an aura in the coverage of his Soul Power. He was obviously a Real God.”

However, the Real God left straight away.

“As expected, even a Real God can’t find me,” Jian Wushuang smiled and he felt at ease.

Then, he took out the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation and started comprehending it and cultivating it in seclusion.

The time flew past.

In the outside world, the experts under the control of Blood Emperor, including Blood Emperor himself, continued to search through a one billion mile range. They even searched deep down in the ground, not letting any corner go unsearched. In a total of a dozen years, the experts almost searched the one billion mile range thoroughly. But they didn’t find Jian Wushuang at all.

“Can’t find him?”

“Did he get out of this place?”

In the sky high above, Blood Emperor’s face grew awkward but he quickly shook his head, “No, it is impossible for him to escape in such short period of time. He is definitely still within the one billion mile range but he definitely cultivated some sort of method that concealed his aura. Hence, we can’t find him.”

“We are in trouble then.”

Blood Emperor was confident that Jian Wushuang was hidden in the one billion miles range and concealing his aura. If he couldn’t even find him with consciousness probing, it would be almost hopeless for him to find Jian Wushuang.

Unless Jian Wushuang revealed himself.

“As long as Jian Wushuang isn’t stupid, he will definitely continue to live in seclusion. Until he reappears, the experts who are under my control won’t stay guard in the one billion mile range to monitor his whereabout for me,” Blood Emperor muttered to himself as he tried to figure out a plan.

“Then, there’s only one way to find the young man.”

There was a glimpse of light in Blood Emperor’s eyes. Then, he took out a communication token.

…

Two years later, when Jian Wushuang was within the one billion mile range, Blood Emperor stood with his hands behind him on the peak of a tall mountain. He looked like he was waiting for something.

Soon, in the void before him, a figure in white robe appeared gradually.

It was a lady in white robe. The lady looked elegant and poised. She was smiling faintly and her body was enrobed with a warm aura. She gave people a holy and pure feeling.

“Blood Emperor, long time no see.”

The holy lady in the white robe walked slowly and appeared before Blood Emperor. She looked at Blood Emperor calmly.

Blood Emperor was one of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison. All experts in Sky Sword Prison would revere Blood Emperor when they see him.

However, the holy lady was rather calm before Blood Emperor. She didn’t seem nervous or afraid but greeted him as though she were seeing an old friend.

“Heartless,” Blood Emperor replied with a faint smile. He didn’t behave haughtily with her either.

Heartless… Heartless King!

One of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison, another expert that was alongside Blood Emperor.

Also, the only Real God in Sky Sword Prison who was good at consciousness attacks.

“I heard that Fiery King went to Mist King’s. Then, he should be at your next. You invited me over today, is it to fight against Fiery King?” The holy lady, Heartless King, asked.

“Fiery King? That mad man!” Blood Emperor’s face grew grave.

Fiery King was like Heartless King and himself, he was also one of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison.

Theoretically, Fiery King was not on the same level as him. In actual fact, the other three Kings in Sky Sword Prison were afraid of him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Plus, Fiery King would leave his territory every once in a while to challenge the other three Kings. As he already looked for Mist King, his next target would be Blood Emperor.

“Humph, the madman can come as he wishes. It has been more than once or twice anyway,” Blood Emperor sneered, then looked at Heartless King, “I invited you over today not because of Fiery King but because of another matter.”

“Oh? Tell me,” Heartless King sounded gentle.

“Heartless, I shall not beat around the bush with you. A thousand years ago, there was a newcomer in Sky Sword Prison named Jian Wushuang,” Blood Emperor said, “Jian Wushuang and I shared a great resentment. I have to kill him!”

“You have great resentment with a newcomer? What kind of resentment?” Heartless King asked.

“It’s something from outside of the prison. It’s inconvenient for me to tell you. Regardless, I have to kill Jian Wushuang,” Blood Emperor was speaking in a deep voice, “Previously, I realized the resentment between him and me. I wanted to kill him on the spot. However, the young man’s defense power was rather strong. He made a narrow escape.”

“Oh?” Heartless King raised her eyebrows and said, “To be able to run away from you, Blood Emperor, just how capable is this Jian Wushuang?”

“The young man is really capable but while he could run away from me, he will never run out of Darkness Mountain. I am definite that he is still hiding somewhere under my nose.”

“Over the past few years, I commanded the experts under my control to search through the area, to probe every inch with consciousness. However, they still can’t find him. I reckon he must have cultivated an impressive hiding method that can conceal his aura from an ordinary Real God’s consciousness probing. Hence… I looked for you!” Blood Emperor explained.

“You want me to look for Jian Wushuang for you?” Heartless King’s pupil contracted.

“Yes,” Blood Emperor nodded, “Among all Real Gods in Sky Sword Prison, you’re definitely on the top of the list in terms of consciousness. The ordinary Real Gods under my control couldn’t find Jian Wushuang’s existence but you could definitely find him if you’re willing to help with your attainment in consciousness.
