Chapter 885: Alone on the Top

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

Following the sound, Tian Quan felt a huge force reaching him through the long spear in his hand. His whole body shook and he felt something sweet in his mouth. He almost gushed out blood.

“You actually held that in? Not bad.” Jian Wushuang laughed faintly. After which, he controlled the scarlet longsword to shoot out again at an alarming speed.

Tian Quan had just barely blocked the first attack and was regaining his posture when the second attack already came his way.

“Why is this happening?”

Tian Quan’s eyes were flickering madly. He immediately spun the long spear and the flaming Exotic Beast image behind him let out a huge growl. It became even more powerful.

Boom! Tian Quan threw the black projectile in his hands.

Jian Wushuang controlled his scarlet long sword and aimed at Tian Quan for the third time.

“No!”

Tian Quan only managed to let out a pitiful cry before his head was pierced by the longsword.

The winner had been decided.

On the Drill Ground, Tian Quan’s head came back together. However, he was as pale as snow. His body was shaking and his gaze was hollow.

The experts in the crowd watching were murmuring to themselves in shock.

“The gap is too big!”

“Three moves, all it took was three attacks to kill Tian Quan.”

“This is absolutely overwhelming.”

“He has such strength, no wonder he can surpass Level Two.”

The crowd had all these thoughts to themselves and were looking at Jian Wushuang in admiration.

If they used to think that luck played a little role in helping Jian Wushuang to pass Level Two, they were now proven wrong by his real strength.

After all, Tian Quan was one of the 12 Kings. Besides, after he achieved a breakthrough in the Secret Skill that he was cultivating, his rank was in the top three.

However, he had failed to take just three attacks from Jian Wushuang before he had been totally crushed.

Perhaps, other than the five big Dao Masters, only the strongest Monster in the 12 Kings of Star Island could display such strength.

“Tian Quan, you’ve lost, you must fulfill your promise. ” Jian Wushuang had already retrieved the Blood-sky Sword. Standing in the Drill Ground, he looked at Tian Quan silently.

Tian Quan’s body was shaking. He was so unwilling to do so. However, since Lord Spirit Sound was present, he could only give away all his belongings and treasures.

The treasures were all given to Jian Wushuang, including the spear he had used just now. It was an Emperor Weapon level.

“Tian Quan, listen carefully. According to the rules of the duel, you must leave Star Island today. You will then roam in the Fog Sea and never return in the next 10,000 years.” Jian Wushuang proclaimed without any emotion on his tone.

After hearing that, Tian Quan’s face became even whiter than a piece of paper.

He had lost all his treasures, but he could think of ideas to gain back some. But if he were to lose his life as well, then that would be the end.

With no treasure in hand, asking him to go to the Fog Sea would be the same as asking him to die.

In conclusion, Tian Quan was in deep trouble this time, he had failed terribly.

However, not only did he suffer loss, he had not even accomplished his true goal. Even if he had failed terribly, he had only himself to blame. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With the presence of Lord Spirit Sound’s power, Tian Quan could only walk out of Star Island cooperatively.

Jian Wushuang was standing on the Drill Ground, looking at Tian Quan’s back as he left. But just at this moment...

“Oh, seems like there’s a commotion today?”

A thick voice was heard suddenly. Following which, the crowd saw a purple-haired elegant man walking slowly towards them. He had two long spears on his back.

This man had an untouchable aura in his mid-brow. Every step he took caused purple ripples in the Void beneath his feet.

Everyone on the Drill Ground squinted their eyes when they saw someone walking towards them.

“Zi Dong! It’s Zi Dong!”

“He is the official number one King among the 12 Kings! It’s Monster Zi Dong!”

“Is Zi Dong actually here?”

“Isn’t he always doing closed-door training?”

The whole Drill Ground became chaotic.

Jian Wushuang lifted his head to see who was coming.

“So is he Zi Dong?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was starting to freeze.

He had been on the island for two years and knew a little bit about some of the experts here.

For example, he knew the names of the 12 Kings on Star Island. Of course, he also knew this King in front of him was ranked first and the so-called Monster. He was also the only one on the island who had passed the test on Level Two of the black tower.

Buzz!

Zi Dong landed in the Drill Ground in front of Jian Wushuang. A pair of strange eyes glowing with purple light were staring straight into Jian Wushuang’s.

“Are you Xuefeng?” Zi Dong asked with a calm voice.

“Yes, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“For all these years, I have been doing closed-door training. I never took notice of what’s happening on Star Island. If Lord Spirit Sound had not notified me just now, saying that you’ve passed Level Two, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have even known that a character like you arrived on the island.” Zi Dong said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrow and glanced at Lord Spirit Sound unconsciously.

He got the news of Zi Dong doing closed-door training from Qian Yu. He knew that he rarely came out. But he actually appeared in front of him today! It turned out that Lord Spirit Sound told Zi Dong the news of him passing to Level Two, which was made him go out in shock.

Being stared by Jian Wushuang, Lord Spirit Sound kept his highly unfathomable smile. He was not intending to give any response.

“Xuefeng, there are quite a number of experts on Star Island. But before today, I was the only one who had managed to pass Level Two. For so many years, I have been standing at the peak all by myself. It may sound glorious, but did you know the other feelings associated with it?” Zi Dong stared at Jian Wushuang.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Indeed, he did.

It was always lonely being above of everyone else.

The other experts, like the other Kings, could find their own opponents on Star Island. They could fight on a regular basis.

But Zi Dong was an exception.

In the Eternal Realm on Star Island, he was already undefeatable. No one dared to provoke nor attack him.

And as for the five big Dao Masters on the island, they were way stronger than him, he was not qualified to challenge them.

This was why he never had a decent opponent for all these years. He did not even have a chance to fight.

This was an unbearable torture for someone born for combat.

“I used to not have any opponents. But things are different now.” Zi Dong smiled faintly and his gaze towards Jian Wushuang became brighter. “I am very excited; after all these years, there’s finally someone else who surpassed Level Two and can enter the Eternal Realm!”

“Xuefeng, come fight with me!”
