The four Sir Gods from Real Martial Arts Divine Church couldn’t help but clench their hands.

They weren’t in a favorable situation.

One should know that Star Extermination Alliance, who had barged into Lineage of Star first back then, were almost wiped out. The five major forces experienced unprecedented damage.

However, for the other four forces, although many of their Almighties had passed away, their leader, their strongest representative, didn’t die. With them attending garrison duty personally, even though they had lesser Almighties, they still had deterrent forces.

But only Real Martial Arts Divine Church had their one and only Peak Emperor God killed.

They had lost their greatest deterrent force. Real Martial Arts Divine Church was just like Lineage of Star back then when they had lost the Master of Star Palace.

Real Martial Arts Divine Church also had many enemies. Previously, they had had scruples because of the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church, because of Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s overall power.

However, it was different now.

On top of that, Lineage of Star has been seizing every chance to fight with them. Real Martial Arts Divine Church was really on the brink of collapse.

“It is the biggest danger we Real Martial Arts Divine Church are experiencing since the establishment of the sect. But God shows sympathy and gave us Real Martial Arts Divine Church another chance to glory again!”

“This time, at the birth of this new ancient battlefield, we have to seize the chance and obtain major opportunities from it!”

The Emperor God clenched his hands as he bellowed. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The four Sir Gods next to him nodded heavily.

The brand new ancient battlefield was their last chance!

“Let’s go!”

The five remaining Almighties from Real Martial Arts Divine Church immediately departed.

There was no Almighty who stayed back.

It was obvious that Real Martial Arts Divine Church was betting for the last time and they placed all their hope on the brand new ancient battlefield that they had just unearthed.

...

Abysmal Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace, Real Martial Arts Divine Church had already departed.

Not only the three major sects, but also Divine King Island, Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, Emperor Sword Palace and so on. Countless forces moved at the instance they received the news.

A large number of experts were moving towards the brand new ancient battlefield simultaneously.

Lineage of Star naturally received the news after such great movement.

In the boundless void, the three Hall Master in Lineage of Star and all guest elders gathered at the hall.

From the expressions on the guest elders’ faces, they were thrilled with excitement. Same went to Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun.

“Hall Master, there’s an update. Almost all of the experts from various sects departed, especially those few who harbor resentment against us. They were especially fast. I heard that Real Martial Arts Divine Church sent all their Almighties to the ancient battlefield,” Hall Master Nie Yun said and added, “Hall Master Yuan, let’s depart immediately too!”

Hall Master Nie Yun’s comment immediately received recognition from all guest elders.

“Yes, let’s depart then. The major opportunities might be gone if we are slow.”

“The birth of a brand new ancient battlefield. The ancient battlefield is definitely filled with treasure. The first one there definitely received the most benefits.”

“We have to hurry up!”

Guest elders exhorted one after another.

“Don’t be in a hurry.”

Hall Master Yuan waved.

Then, Jian Wushuang wasn’t in Lineage of Star. Hence, all affairs in Lineage of Star were naturally decided by Hall Master Yuan.

“What happened was a little strange,” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows.

“What so strange about it?” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun couldn’t help but turn to look at Hall Master Yuan.

“From the information I have gotten, someone intentionally spread it. The way this person spread the news was by arranging Real Gods and Universe Gods to deliver a token that contained a mirror image of the ancient battlefield and also the location to each and every forces and sects, only the major ones!”

“These forces and these sects received the news at the first instant. But don’t forget, Lineage of Star is widely acknowledged as the number one major force in Sanctuary Alliance now. Theoretically, Lineage of Star should be the first to receive news. However, it has already stirred a commotion outside but there is still no one who delivers us any token. Isn’t it strange?” Hall Master Yuan said solemnly.

They heard what Hall Master Yuan had said and they were surprised.

After listening to Hall Master Yuan’s comment, they thought there was really something fishy.

“Maybe, they forgot to send Lineage of Star a message. Or maybe they sent someone but the journey was too far, or the person who was sending the message ran into danger on the way and was killed. There are all kinds of possibilities. It doesn’t mean that the person intentionally didn’t send Lineage of Star any message,” a guest elder said.

“It is possible. However, just in case, I have to report it to Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan said.

The guest elders nodded.

Lineage of Star honored Jian Wushuang as their leader. With such a major event, they naturally needed Jian Wushuang to give command personally.

“Palace Master...” Hall Master Yuan immediately sent Jian Wushuang a message.

Just as the entire Eternal Chaotic World was enthusiastic and mad because of the newborn ancient battlefield, Jian Wushuang continued to stay in Wushuang City in Green Fire World.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged while the ancient bronze mirror floated before him in the air.

The difference was that the aura that the Five Fire Godly Spirit gave out was much stronger than before.

It was obviously the result of Jian Wushuang feeding the five godly spirits with an enormous amount of divine power.

Then, the five godly spirits had already reached a satisfying situation. Even if he continued to feed them with divine power, the five godly spirits’ power wouldn’t increase any more.

“Let’s try the five godly spirits’ power,” Jian Wushuang thought. Under his lead, a boundless aura flowed out of the bronze mirror.

The aura was extremely eerie as though it was from Acheron.

Very soon, the aura substantiated into a black shadow in the secret room.

The black shadow was much bigger than the one Emperor God Xie Xin had performed back then. The rage that he gave out was much more terrifying too.

“Die!”

Under Jian Wushuang’s command, the black shadow immediately took a leap. His right hand formed a fist and punched the void.

There was a purple wall in the void in front of it.

The purple wall was a formation that Jian Wushuang had used One Pearl Realm to form. Its defensive power was extremely strong. But then...

Bang!

The black shadow’s fist hit the purple wall and the entire One Pearl Realm formation started quivering at that instant and trembling in balance.

There was no doubt that the One Pearl Realm formation had definitely collapsed in another similar punch.

“He is so powerful!!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shimmering with joy.

In terms of power, the godly spirit launched a punch that had definitely reached the extreme limit of an Emperor God. He was much stronger than an ordinary Peak Emperor God.

As for the godly spirit, he was originally an expert’s soul. Although he had lost his consciousness, he possessed some massacre skills that one had before he died. If they were to really be in a fight, even Jian Wushuang would have to go all out to suppress the godly spirit.
