4802 An Enemy Sneaks In

This was the Supreme Enlightenment of the Emperor. No one knew how powerful these runes would be.

However, the word ‘Emperor’ was enough.

An Emperor represented the supreme, and the Emperor’s Comprehension was naturally supreme.

As the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes continued to flow into Jian Wushuang’s mind, he gradually became clear and understood some truths, especially his understanding of the cultivation realm.

He knew that in the Great Yan Domain, the Yan Immortal had the meaning of transcendence, and above the Yan Immortal was the so-called Grand Yan Immortal realm.

However, if one wanted to enter the Grand Yan Immortal realm, one had to comprehend the Immortal Style in the Grand Yan Immortal realm.

The so-called Immortal Style was equivalent to a bridge, and once the construction was completed, it would lead to the Grand Yan Immortal.

After entering the Grand Yan Immortal stage, it was further divided into three small realms, which were the Three Revolutions, Five Revolutions, and Nine Revolutions.

Of course, what shocked Jian Wushuang the most was that the Emperor was also in the Grand Yan Immortal realm!

The extremely mysterious Emperor who controlled thousands of Heavenly Regions did not exceed the Grand Yan Immortal realm. This was something that Jian Wushuang had not expected.

Each of Grand Yan Immortal’s three transcendent Revolutions was a heavenly chasm.

A Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal could use Immortal Styles proficiently, while a Five Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal carried the Yan power light wheel and completely crushed any Grand Yan Immortal below Five Revolutions.

Above Five Revolutions was Nine Revolutions, which was golden crow Di Qing’s current cultivation realm, his strength was unfathomable.

After obtaining Emperor Liu Ya’s comprehension and obsession, Jian Wushuang knew about the Emperor’s fate energy and that the Emperor’s power was at the peak the Grand Yan Immortal realm.

Even though the Emperor had not transcended the Grand Yan Immortal realm, he was clearly a different existence from the regular Grand Yan Immortal.

Even Di Qing, who was a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, could only bow down in the face of the Emperor Liu Ya’s obsession.

In the end, it all came down to the existence of the Emperor’s fate energy.

An Emperor was a title, the condensation of the common fate energy of countless Heavenly Regions. It had endless changes and had long exceeded the scope of the Grand Yan Immortal, but they were still within the cultivation realm of a Grand Yan Immortal.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, Grand Yan Immortal was the peak of all realms, and Emperor was the peak of that.

After clearing up the problem between the cultivation realms, Jian Wushuang understood. At the same time, he no longer resisted the opportunities and obsessions that Emperor Liu Ya Lord had given him.

“My request isn’t too much. Even if you don’t want to be enemies with Zhen Wuyang in the future, you can live on with my understanding and open up a territory in the Great Yan Domain.”

As the last comprehension was teleported away, the lingering will of Emperor Liu Ya’s apparition was extremely dim and could dissipate at any moment.

Jian Wushuang looked at the emotionless Emperor and bowed. “I will.”

Emperor Liu Ya’s obsession finally dissipated completely. On his deathbed, he left behind one last curse for Zhen Wuyang’s entire family.

He wanted the Emperor’s death.

After that, everything was silent.

Perhaps he had died dozens of years ago, and it was because of his obsession that he had been able to hold on until today.

The three Emperors seemed to be indifferent to the death of their old friend. They poured all the wine in their wine gourds into the Heavenly Court to comfort themselves.

Endless life, countless bloody battles, and their brothers and friends had long passed away. They had all experienced it and were sure that one day in the future, they would follow in their footsteps, so there was no need to be pretentious.

The entire Heavenly Court was silent, as calm as it was before they arrived.

The three Emperors’ True Shadows smiled at him, then they turned invisible and returned to the Boyang Bottle.

Slowly exhaling a mouthful of turbid breath, Jian Wushuang fell from the sky and sat on the ground as if he had collapsed.

Cheng Qing quickly came over, the excitement on his face could not be concealed, ” Brother Jian, your future cultivation path can be considered to be without worry! That was a personal gift from the Emperor!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head with a bitter smile. The words Emperor Liu Ya were still ringing in his ears.

The Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes could be Comprehended and used, but it would definitely not be able to follow his path.

This was a comprehension that belonged to an Emperor. If he were to use it in the future, it would definitely affect his mind. This was also why Emperor Liu Ya had said those words.

Jian Wushuang knew the stakes, so he did not intend to Comprehend it at the moment.

The right arm that he had condensed was already intact, but if one looked closely, under the skin of the entire arm, a dark blue bird-like totem was drawn by the meridians, and it quickly disappeared.

This scene in the Heavenly Court completely shocked them, especially Di Qing, who still could not believe it.

However, soon, he came back to his senses and looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression, “Thank you for what you did just now.”

“No need to thank me. I’ve already repaid your kindness.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Di Qing was slightly stunned, but he soon understood that the kindness he was talking about was that he had stopped Emperor Liu Ya’s obsession at the most critical moment, giving Jian Wushuang a chance to escape.

Di Qing smiled embarrassedly and then said no more.

Jian Wushuang also did not say anything more. Di Qing had changed a lot from his initial resentment, vigilance, indifference, and today’s talk.

Just from the scene that had happened at the critical moment, Jian Wushuang felt that this guy was not as bad and untouchable as he had thought.

He should be able to try to befriend him.

After sorting out this relationship, he turned his attention to Heavenly Court.

Now that the obsession of Emperor Liu Ya, who was in charge of the Heavenly Court, had dissipated, the entire Heavenly Court had truly become an ownerless object.

Just as Cheng Qing and the others were about to make a move, a series of bell-like voices rang out outside the Heavenly Court.

“Trespassers of the heavenly court shall die!”

That familiar voice came from the three Immortal bone guards in front of the heavenly court.

Jian Wushuang immediately became alert.

Cheng Qing immediately frowned and said, “It can’t be. We haven’t been in here for long, and someone has already discovered this place? Could it be that some random Yan Immortals accidentally barged into this place?”

Very quickly, a large amount of aftershocks from Yan power battle spread from outside the Heavenly Court. It indicated that the situation was not as simple as they had thought.

“Let’s go out and take a look.” Jian Wushuang stood up and there was a surge of Yan power.

His Yan power and cultivation level had been restored to their peak. As long as the enemy was not a Grand Yan Immortal, he was confident that he could annihilate them.

Chen Qing and the others nodded and followed Jian Wushuang to the outside of the Heavenly Court.

At this moment, outside the Heavenly Court, under the chaotic and lightless sky, everything suddenly became extremely bleak. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The broken True Sword, the dead body of Yan Immortal, and the violent Yan power astral wind were all scattered in the abyss.

The three Immortal bone guards that had re-formed from the abyss were also heavily injured.
