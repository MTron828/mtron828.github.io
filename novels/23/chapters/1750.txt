Chapter 1751: Seclusion

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Emperor God Xue Gu was a famous and great expert in the Eternal Chaotic World!

In the past, the Sanctuary Alliance had always thought that Emperor God Xue Gu had a weird personality and he was unwilling to be constrained by the Sanctuary Alliance. However, it was only at that moment that they knew that Emperor God Xue Gu was actually someone from the Acheron Palace!!

As for the Acheron Palace, in order to get rid of Jian Wushuang, a Real God, not only did they employ five Sir Gods to deploy the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, they also employed Emperor God Xue Gu to take action personally. They were really ruthless.

“As for later on…”

Jian Wushuang also gave a simple explanation regarding what he experienced later on. Of course, he had merely talked about some of his own trump cards briefly.

Upon hearing that Jian Wushuang had had an intense battle with Emperor God Xue Gu and that he also did his best to keep himself alive, Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin could not help but admire him.

When he reached the end where the ancient flood dragon appeared, swallowed Emperor God Xue Gu with one gulp, killed the four Sir Gods and attracted two extremely powerful experts to fight a great battle in the Buddhist Demon Sea, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and even the Star Palace Master were stunned.

“That legend is actually real?” the Star Palace Master murmured.

“That legend?” Jian Wushuang could not help but look at the Star Palace Master.

“A long time ago, there was a rumor in the Eternal Chaotic World. It is said that when the Ancient Past and the First Era crumbled, countless experts died during the great battle. However, at the same time, there was a portion of experts who did not die in the great battle. Instead, they entered a state of eternal deep sleep. As for the places that they are in deep sleep in, some of them are in the forbidden areas of the First Era’s battlefield while some of them are in the ancient battlefield.”

“These experts who are in deep sleep possessed exceptionally powerful techniques and even Great Emperors are afraid of them. For example, the Boundless Purgatory in the Second Lair, which is known for its mighty name, is said to be a place of deep sleep of an extremely powerful expert,” the Star Palace Master said earnestly.

“Boundless Purgatory?” Hall Master Gu Xin’s throat could not remain calm.

Going to the Second Lair was the same as going to one’s death if he were to travel there without the fighting capabilities of an Emperor God. For the Boundless Purgatory, Hall Master Gu Xin had only heard of it before.

As for Jian Wushuang, he could remain calm.

After all, back then in the Eighth Lair, he had also come across an expert who was in deep sleep.

He knew very well that the Eternal Chaotic World was not as simple as it looked on the surface.

“Jian Wushuang, according to what you have said, it seems like there are two experts in deep sleep in the Buddhist Demon Sea. However, due to the clash between you and the Acheron Palace, those two experts were awakened by chance and this resulted in the great battle which occurred later on,” the Star Palace Master said.

“Among the two experts, one of them said that I am definitely connected to a sect known as the Seven Star Black Sect. Thus, he took action and saved my life by sending me out of the Buddhist Demon Sea,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Seven Star Black Sect?” Hall Master Gu Xin was stunned as she had never heard of such a sect before.

“I know about the Seven Star Black Sect.” The Star Palace Master opened his mouth and said, “The Seven Star Black Sect is a powerful sect back in the Ancient Past. However, as the Ancient Past collapsed, this sect naturally disappeared along with their long history.”

“As for him saying that you are related to the Seven Star Black Sect, it is considered normal. Because, the Secret Skill of Star Palace that you have cultivated have come from the Seven Star Black Sect. As I was fortunate, I happened to chance upon this Secret Skill’s inheritance.”

“What?” Hall Master Gu Xin was stunned. However, she understood immediately.

The Secret Skill of Star Palace was frightening, extremely frightening.

Due to the existence of the Secret Skill of Star Palace in the Lineage of Star, many powerhouses were afraid of the Lineage of Star.

As for such a kind of Secret Skill, under normal circumstances, even Great Emperor-level experts would be unable to create it. Thus, Hall Master Gu Xin had suspected whether this Secret Skill was created by the Star Palace Master a long time ago. However, the Star Palace Master had never spoken about it before.

At present, the Star Palace Master had taken the initiative to admit it.

“This is what has happened.”

After listening to Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and the Star Palace Master gasped.

They knew very clearly how dangerous Jian Wushuang’s experience this time around was.

At the same time, they had become even more fearful of the Acheron Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, for you to be able to escape by the skin of your teeth this time around, apart from the fact that it was due to your powerful abilities, it was also partially due to luck. As such, you must absolutely be careful in the future,” the Star Palace Master warned.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head earnestly.

One would only learn from their own mistakes. With the narrow escape this time around, Jian Wushuang had a better understanding of the Acheron Palace and he revered the world even more. Thus, he would naturally be more careful in doing things in the future.

After all, he absolutely did not want to experience the same thing twice.

“Alright, since your injuries are very serious, you had better go back and recuperate first,” the Star Palace Master said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

As his injuries were very serious, he would be unable to recover in a short amount of time. Hence, he had already made up his mind to stay in the Lineage of Star for a while to seclude himself in recovery.

In a secret room that was covered heavily by seals in the Sword Star, Jian Wushuang was sitting down with his legs crossed.

“Jian Wushuang, this time around, you survived the assassination that was planned carefully by the Acheron Palace. Moreover, you caused the Acheron Palace to suffer great losses. If this piece of news were to spread, it would definitely cause an uproar in the Eternal Chaotic World and your reputation will improve greatly,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently and he was not arrogant in the slightest.

He knew very clearly that luck had made up a huge portion of the reason why he was able to stay alive.

Looking at the methods that the Acheron Palace had employed, even Jian Wushuang himself could not help but gasp in admiration.

The Acheron Palace would not take action easily. However, when they took action, it was indeed extraordinary and it forced Jian Wushuang into a hopeless situation right away.

If not for him being fortunate and coming across the expert deep inside the Buddhist Demon Sea, he would definitely be dead.

“Forget about the Acheron Palace. However, after that, I was hunted down by Sir God Qian Lan of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. That is the true humiliation!” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and a vast amount of murderous intent emerged in his eyes.

The Acheron Palace had hatched a detailed plan to kill him and the methods that they had employed had caused even Jian Wushuang to exclaim in admiration. Even if he were killed by them, he would not feel any grievances.

But what about the Soaring Heaven King Palace?

They had attacked him when he was seriously injured. This caused Jian Wushuang to be even more furious.

If not for the King of Venomous Worms taking action and stopping Sir God Qian Lan, he would have probably died at the hands of Sir God Qian Lan. That was a true oppression and he would have died an unworthy death.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace!!!”

Jian Wushuang was overflowing with murderous intent.

“There’s no rush. When my abilities recover completely, I shall take my time to play with them!”

However, Jian Wushuang also knew that his injuries this time around were too serious. Hence, it would be impossible for him to recover his abilities completely in a short amount of time.

Moreover, if it were only injuries in his body, it would be alright. However, the most important thing was that he had paid a huge price to fight a fight to the death this time around. In particular, all his six Ancient God Stars were destroyed!

His Ancient God’s cultivation base had fallen to rock bottom and the process for him to recover would not be easy.

“I shall do it slowly. During this period of time where I have secluded myself in recuperation to recover my abilities, I can also absorb all the Demon Cores that I obtained back then and go for Stage Three Ultimate Real God!”

“In addition, there is also the palm that the One-Star Man left behind in my head. That is also a great opportunity!”
