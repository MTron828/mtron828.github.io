Chapter 3057: Passing By

——

“How, how is this possible?”

“This is too strong.”

“Are they really only rank one True Saints?”

The False Saints in Jian Wushuang’s team all had incredulous expressions.

They were indeed incredulous.

A rank one True Saint punched a rank three True Saint until he vomited blood?

A rank one True Saint relied on speed to suppress a rank three True Saint and force him to retreat?

A rank one True Saint was able to kill a rank one True Saint and a rank two True Saint with a single glance, and he was able to restrain two rank three True Saints by himself?

“Genius, this is a true super genius!” Jiu Luo’s eyes were burning.

He was a genius as well.

However, as a genius, he was far inferior to the three people in front of him.

Any one of them could easily suppress a rank three True Saint, but he would have to flee for his life if he encountered a rank three True Saint.

“What’s going on? Why did these three geniuses attack the stronghold of the Blood Crow Organization?” Jiu Luo asked in puzzlement.

Jian Wushuang also frowned.

“Each of these three people is a true genius. They are stronger than Xue Yu and Qian Chen from the Heaven and Earth Palace. It’s hard to meet such a genius, but there are three of them here at the same time.” Jian Wushuang thought quickly, he immediately guessed that the three geniuses must be from the same force.

As for the Blood Crow Organization’s stronghold, they were probably on a special mission.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang raised his head.

On the battlefield, the evil-looking young man who was crazily suppressing a rank three True saint with a purple spear suddenly burst out.

His spear skill was originally astonishingly fast, but in this instant, his spear skill suddenly increased by three times!

A dazzling purple light instantly pierced through the void, leaving the rank three True Saint with no time to react.

Chi!

This purple light directly pierced through the throat of the rank three True Saint, and then a destructive power exploded. The rank three True Saint did not even have time to scream before his divine body was destroyed.

Seeing this scene, the demonic youth smiled strangely and then charged to the side.

“He’s dead.”

“A rank three True Saint was killed just like that?”

“This…this is too terrifying. Besides, didn’t a rank three True Saint master an immortal body? How could he die without using his immortal body?”

The false saints in Jian Wushuang’s team burst into an uproar when they saw this scene.

“It’s poison. The evil-looking young man’s spear has been infused with a special poison. It’s a kind of purple poison.” Jiu Luo narrowed his eyes.

“It’s the Devil Star Poison.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was solemn.

Jian Wushuang had some knowledge of some poisons that could destroy divine power and kill True Saint experts more easily.

For example, the god-burning poison he used before was one of them.

Although the god-burning poison was famous, it was only useful for some rank one and two True Saints. At the rank three True Saint Realm, the divine power was purer and stronger, so the effect of the god-burning poison was negligible.

As for the Devil Star Poison, it was much more famous than the god-burning poison, so its value was naturally higher.

With Jian Wushuang’s permission as a heaven-level member, he could get one drop of the god-burning poison for 300,000 sacred elixirs in the Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

However, the Devil Star Poison, which he could get as a heaven-level member, cost 5 million sacred elixirs for one drop!

There was a difference of more than ten times between 300,000 sacred elixirs per drop and five million sacred elixirs per drop.

For example, the evil-looking young man had killed the rank three True Saint with only one drop of the Devil Star Venom.

“They are so talented that they could kill a True Saint with five million sacred elixirs per drop of the Devil Star Venom. Their backgrounds…” Jian Wushuang said with a serious expression.

Although there were many experts of the Blood Crow Organization on the battlefield, the only ones who could pose a threat to the three were the four rank three True Saints.

However, one of them was killed by the demonic young man on the spot, and the second rank three True Saint was also in danger under the crazy attack of the muscular man.

Boom!

The muscular man threw a punch and smashed the head of the rank three True Saint who was fighting with him like a meteorite.

The head of the third rank True Saint exploded on the spot.

“Evil master!” The muscular man shouted.

“Coming!”

The rank three True Saint who had just killed his opponent laughed loudly and appeared next to the muscular man. The moment the divine body of the rank three True Saint in front of him started to fill up, hua! He stabbed out with his spear. The tip of the spear only touched the divine body of the rank three True Saint, and the rank three True Saint immediately started to die.

The second rank three True Saint was killed.

Next, the muscular man and the bewitching youth attacked again. The three True Saints who were immersed in the white-robed woman’s environment did not survive either.

In just a short moment, the four rank three True Saints were all killed.

As for the rank one and two True Saints, they were also crazily slaughtered by these three.

Because they were covered by the scarlet restriction, these rank one and rank two True Saints had no chance of escaping. In the end, they were all killed.

All of this was clearly seen by Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo’s team.

“Amazing! This is a true genius!”

“Just three rank one True Saints destroyed a stronghold of the Blood Crow Organization and killed all the experts in the stronghold.”

“They are so powerful.”

The False Saints in the team could not help exclaiming in surprise.

But at this time, the muscular man, the evil-looking young man, and the white-robed woman had gathered together.

“Huan Shui and the evil master.”

The muscular man looked at the two people in front of him and said, “It seems that everything is going well.”

“Everything is going well? Not Necessarily.” The evil-looking young evil master had a strange look on his face, and his evil eyes looked toward the void to the side.

The evil master was looking in the direction of Jian Wushuang’s team. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The muscular man and the white-robed woman, Huan Shui, also looked at Jian Wushuang and the others.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures rushed over and arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and the others in an instant.

Jiu Luo and the others were shocked.

Jiu Luo took a deep breath and then said, “We are just passing by. We don’t mean any harm.”

“I know.” The muscular man nodded slightly. He could see that Jian Wushuang’s team was just passing by, and they were sealed in this area by their restriction.

But even if they were just passing by, Jian Wushuang and the others still saw with their own eyes that they destroyed the stronghold of the Blood Crow Organization.
