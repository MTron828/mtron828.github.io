Chapter 2864: Arrived

——

After leaving the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Jian Wushuang flew in the void alone.

“Shuang Er actually lost her memory? But she still feels familiar with me…” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He came to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion purely to join in the fun. But, on the other hand, he was also a little curious about the favored son of heaven, Xiao Feng. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, he did not expect that the Young Phoenix would be his wife, Leng Rushuang.

The moment he saw Leng Rushuang, he was ecstatic. However, Leng Rushuang lost her memory and could not recognize him. It was like giving him a bucket of cold water, which made Jian Wushuang pleasantly surprised.

“In any case, I have seen Shuang Er again. As for her memory, as long as she is familiar with me, it should not be difficult for her to recover it,” Jian Wushuang thought.

At this moment…

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed. He had already reached some movement in the void behind him.

Jian Wushuang remained calm and continued to move forward. He did not stop until he was a certain distance away from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and reached a desolate and vast plain. Then, he turned around.

“Don’t hide anymore. Come out.” Jian Wushuang’s bright voice spread.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Immediately, several figures rushed over from the distant sky and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang instantly.

Six people came, and the leader was Young Master Qu.

Jian Wushuang also recognized the cold middle-aged man standing next to Young Master Qu. He was the Black Blood Emperor.

In addition to the two of them, there were four other people. Their auras were also very impressive. They were all Peak Great Divine Masters.

An Invincible Divine Master, four peak-stage Great Divine Masters, and Master Qu himself was also an Advanced Great Divine Master. Such a lineup was indeed not weak.

“So it’s you, Master Qu. I wonder why you have followed me all the way here?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm. He did not change because of the powerful lineup of Master Qu and the others.

“Sword One.” Master Qu stared at Jian Wushuang.

“You know me, Master Qu?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“I know you. When you visited Lord Mo, I happened to be in Fire Cloud Castle and heard about your visit. At that time, I heard that you were only an Advanced Great Divine Master. But now, in less than ten years, you have already reached the Peak Great Divine Master. Your breakthrough speed is quite fast, isn’t it?” Master Qu said.

“I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“Well, cut the crap. I came to you today for two things. The first thing is to hand over the sword principle treasure that Lord Mo refined for you!” Young Master Qu shouted.

“The sword principle treasure that Lord Mo refined?” Jian Wushuang looked puzzled. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“You don’t know? In that case, I don’t have to say the second thing. I’ll kill you,,,, and then I’ll go to your interspatial ring to find it. Kill him!” Young Master Qu shouted in a low voice.

The Black Blood Emperor did not move, but the four Peak Great Divine Masters behind him immediately moved.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Four powerful auras burst out in an instant.

Peak Great Divine Masters was definitely the top expert in the sacred world. In the Pill Sun Sacred World, there were only a few Peak Great Divine Masters, and each of them could be considered the strongest battle strength, but now, the four Peak Great Divine Masters attacked simultaneously!”

The four Peak Great Divine Masters were mighty. Because they sensed that Jian Wushuang’s aura was also at the level of a Peak Great Divine Master, they did not underestimate Jian Wushuang. Instead, they attacked with all their strength.

One of the four Peak Great Divine Masters suddenly grew to 30 meters, like a mountain. Behind him, a huge phantom of a strange beast appeared. His aura was monstrous, and his feet stepped on the void as he crazily charged toward Jian Wushuang.

The second person was a green-clothed woman. She held a dark green whip in her hand, and with a fierce swing of the whip, Jian Wushuang could vaguely hear the sound of flowing water. Large waves spread wildly toward him.

The third person was a short, thin man. Although he was short, his violent aura was the strongest among the four people present. He held a golden-red sledgehammer, shining with golden light. He looked like a God who had descended from heaven. He swung the sledgehammer and smashed it into the void. Immediately, large waves spread out in the space.

The last person was an older man with messy hair. The older man stood where he was and did not rush out. However, there was a layer of yin flame in his eyes. A strange power silently attacked Jian Wushuang. This power was a soul attack.

The four Great Divine Masters attacked with all their strength, vowing to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly, and then he flew out.

He did not use any secret skills.

He did not use seven-star secret skill, penal law divine realm, or nine luminaries star armor.

He just relied on his current divine power and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Boom!

A powerful soul attack came at him at once. However, after passing through his body’s defense and hitting the exquisite pagoda, it only shook the pagoda slightly and easily blocked it.

Then, the towering mountain formed by the 30-foot-tall burly man came straight at him.

Jian Wushuang casually struck out with his sword.

That’s right. He struck with the body of the sword, not with the blade.

Although it was just a casual strike, with Jian Wushuang’s own strength and the power of the Blood Mountain Sword, the strike’s power was still at the peak of the Great Divine Master level.

Bang!

The towering mountain that came crashing toward him was instantly sent flying. Then, Jian Wushuang gently slashed with his long sword. It was as casual as before, but it blocked the long whip of the cyan-robed woman and the giant hammer of the skinny man.

Jian Wushuang easily neutralized the Four Peak Divine Masters’ full-strength attacks.

“This kid seems to be quite strong. Be careful!” The Elder who used soul attacks said.

The other three looked very serious.

Then the four attacked Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry. Since the Blood Mountain Sword had been infused with his blood essence, its power had soared. He had not used the Blood Mountain Sword to fight with anyone since then. Now was a rare opportunity, so he was not in a hurry to finish off his opponent. He still wanted to get used to the power of the lower Blood Mountain Sword.
