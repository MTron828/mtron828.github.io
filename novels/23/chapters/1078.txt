Chapter 1079: Dream-chasing!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Back then, Jian Wushuang had acquired King Luo Zhen’s Inheritance Essence Blood.

There was also immense Bloodline Power in the Inheritance Essence Blood. During the war of Tang of the East, he swallowed the drop of blood. In the end, he did win but was turned into blood fog due to the eroding of the Inheritance Essence Blood.

If he did not happen to be in the Everlasting Realm, he probably had already died.

Although the Bloodline Power the Celestial Master Ku Xin had devoured was not as pure and refined as King Luo Zhen’s Essence Blood, it still made him surge to a brand new level.

“We’re in trouble.” Jian Wushuang squinted.

His father was a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm who had developed the strongest Sword Principle, peerless among in Celestial Master level.

But the present Celestial Master Ku Xin had become stronger to a point where he almost reached the Supreme Level.

“Jian Nantian!”

Celestial Master Ku Xin looked hideous with a pair of scarlet eyes. He stared at Jian Nantian. “I said, you’ve underestimated the Ancient Demon Clan!”

Upon finishing his words, he struck again.

A large, scarlet palm sailed through the air, through all matter in the world. Finally, it stopped in front of Jian Nantian.

For the first time, the ever calm Jian Nantian furrowed.

When the scarlet palm was about to land on him, he fought back.

Clang!

Another glowing sword light was shot out.

Bam!

With a thunderous sound, even time seemed to stop.

The scarlet palm just hovered in the Void for a second, then landed overwhelmingly onto Jian Nantian.

In the end, the giant hand thumped on the ground.

Under the giant palm was the city of the Ancient Demon Clan, now, the mountains were smashed into dust. Moreover, numerous palaces were also razed to the ground.

Even a few clansmen from the Ancient Demon Clan did not dodge the palm timely and were shattered into pieces.

The entire ground sank as a giant mark of palm crawled on it. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The whole world fell silent.

Everyone was astonished in front of the giant mark.

Under the giant mark, nothing was moving.

“Father.”Jian Wushuang’s complexion slightly changed.

“Don’t worry, your father is still alive.” Gu King said abruptly.

Being more sensitive to living life than anyone present, Gu King could feel a resilient life thriving under the giant palm mark.

Crack!

The sunken ground cracked, flicking lots of gavels. Then, an injured man came into view.

At this time, Jian Nantian was covered in blood, ragged.

However, though injured, he did not show any fear in his black eyes, only indifference.

Moreover, his countenance stayed the same.

“He’s still alive and just lightly injured?” A look of shock escaped Celestial Master Ku Xin.

The spectators marveled at it as well.

One must know that the scarlet palm had been extremely mighty just now.

It had been a blow fiercer than that of an ordinary Celestial Master. Normally, if not dead, the Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm at least should be badly injured.

But he just appeared a little worn-out, and his aura remained as strong as usual.

“You…” Celestial Master Ku Xin shot out a ferocious look and emitted immense Killing Intent.

Right at that moment, Jian Nantian looked up and fixed his pitch-black eyes on Celestial Master Ku Xin.

“For today… I’ve prepared myself for 2,100 years!”

“Every hardship, every narrow escape, and every struggle I’ve endured during the 2,100 years were for today!”

“No one stops me today!”

“You don’t stop me!”

Like a cocked sharp sword, Jian Nantian was about to shot through the sky.

He sounded cold and spread his every word into the universe. Everyone’s heart was thumping.

Upon finishing his words, he raised his longsword.

At that moment, it seemed that everything else had vanished, leaving the world with only Jian Nantian carrying his sword.

A dreamy aura was spread in the air. With a feeling of melancholy and a state of obscurity, the unstoppable aura sailed through the air.

Before his swordsmanship, the power he had collected already great impressed everyone present, including Celestial Master Ku Xin.

Everyone present had sensed that Jian Nantian had extracted eight tenths of his Spiritual Power.

One must know that being a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm, Jian Nantian had held abundant Spiritual Power.

If he used eight tenths of his Spiritual Power, then how great would that be?

Did he utilize the best part of his Spiritual Power simply for a blow?

How strong would that blow be?

“That blow…” Even Gu King, who was living inside Jian Wushuang, felt his heart skip a beat in face of Jian Nantian’s Spiritual Power.

For some reason, Gu King felt something familiar. It rang a bell with him. He seemed to have witnessed the performance of the swordsmanship.

As power was accumulating in his sword, Jian Nantian murmured.

“Years before, I’ve stepped into a Secret Land. I saw this swordsmanship purely by chance.”

“The swordsmanship is so profound that I spent hundreds of years to try to reproduce it. However, I’ve merely replicated a half of it.”

“After that, based on the half swordsmanship I’ve copied, I created a new sword movement through a lot of hard work.”

“I haven’t performed it in public ever. I haven’t even named it yet.”

“Now, I’ll reveal the swordsmanship!”

“It’ll help me get rid of every barrier, and every enemy, just to meet Meng’er (Ji Wumeng) at Heaven-ceasing Peak!”

“Therefore, I’ll name it… Dream-chasing (finding Meng’er)!”

It was named!

It was invented!

Its Sword Essence has spread!

Right at the next moment, Jian Nantian brandished his sword with the mighty swordsmanship.

As the name suggested, he struck out, only for reaching Heaven-ceasing Peak… to meet Ji Wumeng!

Clang!

A sword light was shot without any trace of Spiritual Power.

Quietly, it snaked toward Celestial Master Ku Xin.
