Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After Jian Wushuang asked Qiu Yue something about the Lineage of Star, he went to visit the vast building complex in the Sword Star.

He wanted to know more about the numerous cultivation resources in the Lineage of Star.

He chose to go to the Scripture Depository and the Reset Palace, which only allowed disciples from the Star Palace.

In the complex.

“Hi!” Jian Wushuang greeted someone.

He was an ordinary disciple from the Lineage of Star. He was thin.

He turned around when he heard Jian Wushuang’s greeting.

He immediately feel the existence of Jian Wushuang’s token as a disciple from the Star Palace.

“Nice to meet you, Brother. I am Qu Yang” The young man bowed to Jian Wushuang politely.

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“You came here not long ago, right?” The young man looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“In the Lineage of Star, ordinary disciples should show respect to disciples from the Star Palace regardless of how powerful he is or how long he has joint the Lineage.” Qu Yang explained smilingly.

Jian Wushuang now understood.

“Is there anything that I can help you?” Qu Yang asked.

“Could you please take me to the Scripture Depository and the Reset Palace? I am still unfamiliar with their locations.” Jian Wushuang asked politely.

“OK, please follow me.” Qu Yang accepted the request delightedly.

Only after a while they arrived at the Scripture Depository.

“Now we are in the Scripture Depository. You may enter and I will wait for you here.”

“Thank you very much.” Then Jian Wushuang entered the Scripture Depository.

Neither books nor tokens were stored in the Scripture Depository. The only thing that Jian Wushuang discovered was four secret rooms.

In front of the four secret rooms sat a white-haired elder. He raised his head as Jian Wushuang approached him.

“Are you the new member?” The elder asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“There is a rule here. Each disciple from the Star Palace can cultivate one secret skill in the Scripture Depository with no condition. But if they want to cultivate a second one, they should meet a certain requirement. I can feel that you have already cultivated the Secret Skills of Star Palace, so you are not eligible to cultivate others.” The elder said.

Jian Wushuang then continued to ask him.

“So what requirements should I meet in order to cultivate the second secret skill?”

“Among the three cultivation places in our Lineage of Star, the Star Tower is a place where we test our unique skills and sword principles. There are three levels in the tower and you only have to pass the third one.”

“OK. The Star Tower.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and left.

Qu Yang was still waiting outside the Scripture Depository.

“How was your visit?” Qu Yang asked.

“I had cultivated the Secret Skills of Star Palace before I arrived at the Lineage of Star. So now I have to pass the third level of the Star Tower in order to cultivate the second secret skill.” Jian Wushuang answered.

Qu Yang said, “Well, the Star Tower is not far from here. I could lead you there.”

“Good idea.”

They went to the Star Tower.

The Star Tower was a splendid, purple-gold big tower with six levels.

“Good luck to you, Brother.” Qu Yang said.

Jian Wushuang started to ponder. Lei Chao told him that the Star Tower was quite similar to the Nine Boundaries Tower but was on a higher level. Jian Wushuang passed the fourteenth level of the Nine Boundaries Tower, but he was unsure which level he could pass in the Star Tower.

Jian Wushuang entered the first level with hope in his heart.

On the first level, he saw his opponent, a cold middle-aged man.

The man waved his sword when he saw Jian Wushuang, saying, “You are good at swordsmanship? Let us see who is the winner!”

Jian Wushuang took out his Blood Mountain Sword and he became excited.

“Come on!”

The man yelled and he stepped forward. Then he waved his sword to Jian Wushuang.

This attack was appalling, full of coldness and darkness.

Jian Wushuang generated his power and started to wave the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Dragon Roar!”

The power of the sword exploded.

But when the two forces of sword collided with each other….

Bang!

Under the attack, Jian Wushuang’s sword power totally collapsed.

The attack from the man directly hit Jian Wushuang’s body.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s figure was blasted out.

Outside the Star Tower, Qu Yang was waiting.

He was wondering how many levels Jian Wushuang had passed.

He thought, “Though Brother Jian Wushuang is a new member here and hasn’t cultivated with the resources of the Lineage of Star, he must be powerful as a disciple from the Star Tower. So, I guess…he’ll pass at least the second level?”

“But passing the third level will be difficult. He may only be able to pass the third after cultivating for a long time in the Lineage of Star.”

But as Qu Yang was thinking, he saw a figure blast out of the Star Tower. The figure was Jian Wushuang.

“What happened?”

Qu Yang was shocked.

“He was blasted out soon after entering into the tower?”

“In such a short time?”

Indeed, a very short time.

Within just ten breaths, Jian Wushuang was blasted out of the tower. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang was as shocked as Qu Yang.

“It was just the first level…and it’s more powerful than I imagined…”

The man’s swordsmanship defeated him easily within a very short time.

Jian Wushuang had utterly failed.
