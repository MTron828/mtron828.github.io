4277 Great Emperor Jin Wu

“Pfft!”

Under the indescribable, terrifying power, Jian Wushuang retreated crazily and his arms exploded!

The Eternal Night Kingdom formed by the Eternal Night swordsmanship was shattered!

“What kind of power is this?” Jian Wushuang looked over in shock.

!!

The Golden Crow Prince’s eyes were tightly shut and his energy was extremely weak. He was on the verge of death and seemed like he would die at any moment.

However, behind him, countless flames suddenly surged.

The flame gathered behind him and slowly turned into a human figure. He then reached out his hands and lifted the Golden Crow Prince up.

The flaming figure’s face could not be seen clearly, but it had a pressure that could make the world lose its color and make all races submit to it!

The pressure was extremely terrifying. Under the pressure, Jian Wushuang’s divine body could not help but be torn apart.

After the pressure passed Jian Wushuang, it swept out in all directions. Wherever the pressure passed, the void would explode!

What kind of power?!!

“The aura of a Ruler!”

Under this pressure, the entire last eight cities were shocked!

Countless people were shocked and rushed over, looking at this place.

Some of these gazes even came from the nine magnates!

However, after seeing the flaming figure, the nine big shots, who had always been all-powerful in the back eight cities, all put away their unscrupulous sizing up and became extremely respectful and obedient.

“Who dares to hurt my son?”

The flaming figure raised his head slowly and looked at Jian Wushuang. Then, he spoke in a deep voice that was so majestic that no one could resist.

It was as if he was a heavenly God who controlled the life and death of the universe, holding the power to kill!

In the eyes of the flaming figure, there were two balls of divine fire. The two balls of divine fire were like two suns embedded in them. No one could look at them directly. Under the gaze of the flaming figure, the void seemed to be unable to hold on and was about to collapse. Jian Wushuang’s body was trembling as if his divine body was about to explode.

“Great Emperor Golden Crow!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with anger and his pupils shrank.

Jian Wushuang did not have to guess to know that the flaming figure was the famous great Emperor Jin Wu!

The great Emperor Jin Wu had made his name 500 chaos cycles ago. He was one of the most senior top-tier Supremes in the universe. His strength ranked in the top ten among the universe Supremes. He dominated the heavens and his name shook all races. The name ‘Great Emperor Jin Wu’ was definitely one of the most terrifying names in the universe! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even the Blood Wave Supreme and the Supreme Giant Axe could only be considered juniors in front of the Golden Crow. They had to show respect to the Golden Crow.

“Was it you who hurt my son?”

Great Emperor Jin Wu’s gaze was fixed on Jian Wushuang’s face. Although he was asking a question, his domineering tone was unquestionable.

Jian Wushuang felt Emperor Jin Wu’s gaze was like a terrifying divine fire that was about to burn through him.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth and did not reply.

He was not a stupid and reckless person. Even though he was extremely aggrieved, he knew that at this moment, rather than arguing, it was better to remain silent and use silence to express his attitude.

In this world, the strong were respected.

No one would try to reason with an ant that could be crushed with a finger.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, was like an ant that could be crushed with one finger.

The Golden Crow narrowed his eyes and looked up at the sky. “Little guy, this Lord will not argue with you this time for the sake of that Lord. However, you won’t be so lucky next time.”

After saying that, the flaming figure of great Emperor Jin Wu and the Golden Crow Prince, whose eyes were closed, turned into fine sand from their feet. In the end, a breeze blew by and the two disappeared into the eight cities behind the Ancient Path of Stars.

It was not until there was only the strong wind in the sky that Jian Wushuang finally relaxed and let out a long breath.

“Is this how terrifying a top-tier Supreme-being in the universe is?”

Jian Wushuang laughed bitterly. He had originally thought that although the Supremes were terrifying, they would not be so terrifying. For example, he had previously met the Black Eagle Supreme from the Cosmos Temple, the White floating Supreme from the great void God temple, and so on. Although he was far from being a match for them, they would not be so terrifying that his soul would tremble with just a look.

This was the first time he had faced a top-tier Supreme Being in the universe, and the oppression and suffocation coming from the depths of his soul made him feel like he was looking up at the endless sky when he was young.

That feeling made him feel so small.

Moreover, the flaming figure was not the real great Emperor Jin Wu. It was just a divine power mark left by the great Emperor Jin Wu on the Golden Crow Emperor.

How terrifying would the real great Emperor Jin Wu be?

Jian Wushuang did not dare to think any further.

…

…

At this moment, in the solar star system that was extremely far away from the depths of the universe.

This was the habitat of the Golden Crow Tribe.

The nine huge fireballs were arranged in a formation of nine stars, forming a circle of light, like the stars surrounding the moon. In the middle of these nine fireballs, there was a sun that was a hundred times larger than these nine fireballs, suppressing the starry sky.

This sun was so huge that it was impossible to describe it with words. Ordinary stars were as small as dust in front of it. The flames it emitted lit up the surrounding dozens of star areas.

Gulp.

On the sun in the center, there were countless streams of boiling lava flowing and rolling. huge bubbles emerged, giving off terrifying burning sounds. every time a bubble burst, countless divine flames would splash out.

Any random wisp of this divine flame could kill an ultimate sovereign!

“Father, what’s wrong with big brother?”

At this moment, a three-legged Golden Crow that was ten thousand miles long flew out from one of the nine small Suns. It flapped its wings and came to the huge sun in the center.

“It’s none of your business. Don’t ask, don’t ask.” A deep, majestic, and ancient voice came from the depths of the central Sun.

...

When the three-legged Golden Crow heard this, his body trembled and he did not dare to ask any more questions. He quickly took his leave.

In the depths of the sun, in the endless lava, a pair of huge scarlet eyes suddenly opened.

“The Ancient Path of Stars this time around is quite interesting.”

“Hmm…the aura I sensed earlier, that little fellow who was exiled by the dragon clan, seems to have gone too?”

“Interesting.”

With a faint smile, the pair of huge scarlet eyes slowly closed.

The great Emperor Jin Wu fell into a long slumber once more.

The unconscious Golden Crow Imperial Prince slowly rose from the depths of the lava.

His flabby and wrinkly skin began to recover gradually under the nourishment of the lava. His dissipated divine power was also restored at an astonishing speed.

The next moment!

The Golden Crow Prince’s eyes suddenly opened. He took a heavy step and rushed out of the lava.

...

“Blood Sword, how dare you kill me? I will definitely kill you!”

A shrill roar suddenly exploded in the solar star area!
