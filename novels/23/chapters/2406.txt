Chapter 2407: The Ice Queen

“Huh, he blocked it?” The strong blonde man’s face betrayed his surprise.

“Let’s go again!”

That time, the strong blonde man added more strength to his hand.

The big axe continuously swung out with the occasional heavy chops and sideway slices, charging like rolling waves at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was seemingly calm when facing the attacks and casually waved his sword. It was only a regular sword, but his movements were flawless with almost no weak points.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

With every weapon clash, the strong blonde man’s strength became stronger. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, no matter how he increased his strength, Jian Wushuang’s sword could still head-to-head ward off his axe.

After tens of clashes, the strong blond man had pushed his strength to the extreme of Third-Class Divine Demon, but he still could not inflict any damage on Jian Wushuang.

“This kid...”

The strong blonde man began feeling mad, as the strength in his hands rose again.

He was giving his all this time and not holding back anymore.

The battle strength of a Second-Class Divine Demon was fully unleashed.

With another ‘clang’, his vicious axe strike was once again blocked by Jian Wushuang who remained calm as usual.

“Bastard!”

Are you messing with me?!”

The strong blonde man was finally outraged.

At that point in the intense battle, even a fool could tell that Jian Wushuang had been playing around with him.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang could calmly ward off because he was holding back his strength by barely releasing the strength of Third-Class Divine Demon.

Now that he had completely unleashed all the divine powers that he had as a Second-Class Divine Demon, Jian Wushuang could still calmly handle it.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang was also holding back for the entire time and not calling his opponent out. He was clearly playing with the strong blonde man.

“Kid, you’ve pissed me off. Now drop dead!”

The strong blonde man let out a deep growl, his giant axe and body began to glow with a golden hue. The strong blonde man suddenly turned into a dash of lightning while his axe became a golden thunderbolt, hacking forward at Jian Wushuang.

The power of his strike was incredibly terrifying that even a Second-Class Divine Demon would have to take it very seriously.

However, Jian Wushuang was very calm when he saw the golden bolt of lightning. With the sword in his hand, he stabbed horizontally outwards without any fanciness.

It was just a simple stab, but it went straight into the middle of the bolt.

Crackles and sizzles ensued while the bolt of lightning dissolved with golden electric currents shooting outwards into every direction.

The strong blonde man’s powerful hit was still warded off easily by Jian Wushuang.

“I, uh...”

The blonde strong man’s expression turned from outraged to complete shock.

He already gave his heaviest possible blow, and yet, the Chaotic Realm Jian Wushuang could still withstand it? Not to mention that he remained absolutely calm throughout.

The strong blonde man simply could not accept that.

Jian Wushuang was infinitely indifferent, his facial expression did not change a bit.

He could easily withstand even the most powerful hit from a First-Class Divine Demon, let alone a Second-Class.

“The surrounding situations don’t look very positive, huh?”

Jian Wushuang even had the capacity to keep a lookout at the battlefield during all that.

He had only fended off a Second-Class Divine Demon, but the other Second-Class Divine Demon disciples from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace were still fighting with Narcissus Island disciples. Due to their advantage in numbers, the Narcissus Island disciples were naturally at a clear disadvantage, as on Wei Qing’s side...

Wei Qing fought a Purple Battle Trooper just moments ago and was severely injured, his ability had declined a great deal. He was thoroughly overpowered when fighting another extremely powerful Second-Class Divine Demon, and his injuries got more severe. It was very hard for him to keep enduring.

None of the Narcissus Island disciples around could find a chance to help him, as they were all being overpowered, after all.

Meanwhile, on the side of First-Class Divine Demons, Su Tong was fighting neck-and-neck with the First-Class Divine Demon from Black Thunder Pavilion while Zhong Yi had been completely suppressed by Tang Xiao and Na Shiyu, without having a chance to help anybody else.

“If this continues, Senior Brother Wei Qing would have to use his safety token to retreat from Saint’s Tomb, before the Second Elder at the outer realm could finish negotiations with Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace. Looks like I’ll have to do something!” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

In fact, Jian Wushuang did not wish to prematurely show his true abilities.

That way, he could have a big advantage during the fight for the six positions in the inner area with significantly higher chances of winning a position.

However, if he took action at that moment, words about his abilities would naturally go around and genius disciples from every sect would know about it. By then everyone would be on guard against him, hence it would not be as easy to win a position.

Previously, Jian Wushuang simply wanted to uneventfully reach the final stage with the Narcissus Island disciples and only made his move when the six positions appeared.

However, he had no choice but to take action with the situation he was facing.

After all, those were his senior and junior brothers from the same sect. He could not allow them to get bullied by those people from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace.

He took a deep breath and raised his head, his eyes were already giving a penetrating gaze.

On the nearby battlefield, Xiao Heng was having an intense fight with an incredibly powerful Second-Class Divine Demon.

However, he would often glance over at Jian Wushuang during the battle.

Xiao Heng’s eyes lit up when he saw the change in Jian Wushuang’s facial expression. “Finally making a move?”

Xiao Heng was well aware that Narcissus Island was at an absolute disadvantage in the battle.

However, as long as Jian Wushuang was willing to give his all during a disadvantage like this, the tables would turn.

Jian Wushuang was about to make his move, but he stopped.

“Is there a turnaround?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the void on the side and noticed a few figures dashed towards their direction at high speed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Four figures appeared in the void surrounding the battlefield.

“Look what we have here? Quite a party, isn’t it?”

Sarcastic laughter filled the air, everyone on the battlefield could hear it.

All those who were fighting—Narcissus Island, Black Thunder Pavilion, and Cold Blood Palace disciples—looked over.

Among the four newcomers, three of them were only Second-Class Divine Demons, but their leader was a valiant and beautiful lady in green armor—a true First-Class Divine Demon.

Zhong Yi, Tang Xiao, and Na Shiyu were all surprised to see such a beauty.

“Looks like she’s Zhuo Bing from Ancient Star Temple!”

“Zhuo Bing? The Ice Queen!”

“It’s her!”

Knowing who had arrived, both Tang Xiao and Na Shiyu had fear written on their faces.

The Ice Queen enjoyed fairly substantial fame among the younger generation in Wusha Wilderness, at least a lot more famous than both of them.

Even Zhong Yi was slightly weaker than the Ice Queen.

“Zhuo Bing the Ice Queen?”

Jian Wushuang froze when he heard that name. He immediately glanced over at the green-armored lady, and his expression became weird upon seeing her.
