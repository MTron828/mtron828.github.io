Chapter 118: Exerting the Utmost Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Die!” The long sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand silently appeared in front of the third gold-masked assassin and he was directly killed without putting up any resistance.

“How could that be?”

“How is he so fast?”

The remaining gold-masked assassins were horrified.

They didn’t know that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension in Sword Essence of Gale was so high that he could execute the sixth move of the Formless Sword Arts.

The Formless Sword Arts were known as the top sword skill in the Tianzong Dynasty. How could it not be terrifyingly powerful?

The sixth move truly was extremely powerful.

The Sixth move could not be executed in the fight against Xiao Mang because his comprehension of the Essence of Gale was deeper. Xiao Mang was also stronger than Jian Wushuang, so this move could not threaten Xiao Mang.

However, when Jiang Wushuang used it against these gold-masked assassins, who were not on the Earthly Dragon List, the Formless Sword Arts could massacre them.

These gold-masked assassins had no chance to fight back against the speed released by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“The fourth one.” Jian Wushuang’s sword slashed out again. Covering a distance of more than ten meters instantaneously, the sword pierced the fourth gold-masked assassin’s throat.

However, after he killed the fourth gold-masked assassin…

“What?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head quickly as a black figure appeared in his sight. The black figure had arrived in front of him in an instant from a distance of more than ten meters.

“This speed!” Jian Wushuang was surprised upon seeing the black figure’s palm that was thrusting towards his head.

Jian Wushuang was shocked by the power contained in this palm attack. He would instantly die, without question, if this blow landed on his head.

At this critical moment, the Triple-kill Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand directly stabbed through the voice, toward the center of the incoming palm.

BANG!

The sword edge of the Triple-kill Sword collided with that palm. However, the Triple-kill Sword failed to pierce the palm and the palm suppressed Jian Wushuang with irresistible and terrifying power.

Jian Wushuang felt a mighty force being transmitted through his arm, then he sprayed a jet of blood out of his mouth as his body fiercely shot backward, like a bullet.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s figure was knocked back on the ground by more than ten meters, with the ground cracking as his figure was continued rolling. It did not stop until his body rolled into Quiet Moon Lake.

The whole Quiet Moon Lake immediately became still.

Everyone looked, their mouths agape, at the black-robed figure hovering in the void.

There was a man in a black robe and purple mask. But, the most important part was that he was standing in the air!

His identity was instantly clear!

“Purple-masked assassin!”

“Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“A purple-masked assassin from Blood Feather Tower came to kill Jian Wushuang himself?”

“Swordsman is going to die! He is done!”

Everybody was shocked.

There were few experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm in the Tianzong Dynasty. It was very unlikely to meet one of these experts. The purple-masked assassin from Blood Feather Tower was exceedingly more powerful than normal experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

Nobody present thought that Jian Wushuang, merely in the Initial Gold Core Realm, could still be alive after the attack from the purple-masked assassin.

“Third Brother!”

Seeing Jian Wushuang slowly sinking into Quiet Moon Lake, Su Rou’s beautiful expression grew hideous and her killing intent burst out.

“You will die!”

Staring at the purple-masked assassin, a blast of air surged from Su Rou’s body. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Su Rou had released this wind several times, but this time was the strongest.

This terrifying wind astonished the purple-masked assassin and he instantly looked at Su Rou.

“This girl…” Seeing the increasingly terrifying wind that was released by Su Rou, the purple-masked assassin’s mouth twitched.

He felt that Su Rou was incredibly dangerous.

Su Rou coldly stared at the purple-masked assassin and a cold voice emerged from her, “Asshole. Go die!”

The huge sword was slashed out…

Swoosh!

The Great Sword was outclassing over and it was easy to pass through the void so that there was an awkward windbreak in the air. The sturdy sword edge also swept from the ground and crashed. The ground suddenly cracked. A large crack that is more than two meters wide.

An enormous power soared into the sky with an overwhelming aura.

Gathering his look, he became careful. The purple-masked killer clenching his right hand, the spiritual power burst out. Without hesitation, a fist was shaken with angry, and when it came out, a crisp explosion from his body also rang through the world.

BANG!

After the collision between them, the purple-masked assassin groaned and his body immediately flew backwards, crashing into a large tree that was tens of meters away.

Crack!

Apparently, the tree could not bear the terrifying force, so it directly splintered.

“This, this stream of power…” Looking at his still tingling palms, the purple-masked assassin looked at Su Rou in a different way. “The girl is from that place? I cannot kill her.”

After exerting her strongest move, the aura of Su Rou’s body had already begun to diminish. There was also sweat on her beautiful face. Obviously, she did not have enough force to attack again. However, while clenching her jaw, Su Rou still stared at the purple-masked assassin.

“I don’t dare to kill you.” The purple-masked assassin shook his head. Without any thoughts of tangling with Su Rou, his figure flew out and appeared over Quiet Moon Lake.

As for Su Rou, all she could do was watch him.

“Third Brother!” Staring at the lake surface, Su Rou began trembling.

Jian Wushuang had disappeared and the surface of the lake was placid.

In Quiet Moon Lake, Jian Wushuang was surrounded with endless lake water as his eyes opened.

Wa!

A load of blood surged from his mouth.

Compared with Gold Core Realm warriors, experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm were much stronger. A mere palm attack was enough to seriously injured him. He even felt like his internal organs had been completely rearranged.

He was in extreme pain.

It was all he could do to face that attack one time. If it came again, he would definitely die.

“I was sure that they would not send only ten gold-masked assassins since Blood Feather Tower wants to kill me. And I was right. But it was beyond my expectation that Blood Feather Tower would send a purple-masked assassin to kill a warrior in the Initial Gold Core Realm.”

Although Jian Wushuang was seriously injured, the battle intent in his eyes was still powerful.

“This time, I will use my full strength!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and his eyes blinked with a vestige of insanity.

“Soul-devouring… Secret Skill!”

Hum~~~ Quiet Moon Lake quaked.

Jian Wushuang’s body seemed to be a black hole that could devour everything as a stream of natural power from all things of the universe rushed into his body at an amazing speed.

With the natural power being injected, Jian Wushuang’s aura began to soar.

It had been one year, now Jian Wushuang was executing the Soul-devouring Secret Skill again!

He was in a desperate fight!
