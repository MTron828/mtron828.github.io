Chapter 1756: The Strongest Man, Emperor Bai!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Who is it exactly?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but ask.

He was also very curious about in whose hand the inverse cultivation skill was.

One should know that Real God Wu Bei was also an arrogant Sir God when he was at his zenith. Plus, he had a White Blaze Fruit Tree and also a certain capital. However, Real God Wu Bei didn’t even stand a chance to see the expert.

Who exactly was the exceedingly great person that Real God Wu Bei couldn’t see even though he wanted to?

“Jian Wushuang, you have been in Sanctuary Alliance for so long. You should have a certain understanding of the Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World, right?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“How about Great Emperor?” Hall Master said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew about the Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World, that was the truth. For instance, he could immediately recognize Emperor God Xue Gu the moment he used his divine weapon.

However, he only knew some of the Sir Gods and Emperor Gods, and he only had a brief understanding of them.

As for Great Emperors… Jian Wushuang didn’t know much about the Great Emperors.

“Would the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill be in a Great Emperor’s hand?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, and he isn’t any ordinary Great Emperor,” Hall Master Yuan continued. “Jian Wushuang, you know that Sanctuary Alliance is a definite overlord of Eternal Chaotic World and the ones in the highest position in Sanctuary Alliance are the super experts at Great Emperor level. Do you know how many Great Emperors there are in Sanctuary Alliance?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Thirteen of them!” Hall Master Yuan read out a number.

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

It wasn’t because he found the number huge but… there were too few.

One must know that Sanctuary Alliance gathered all forces in Eternal Chaotic World and solo experts in the ten sanctuaries.

Just how few there were.

“Among the thirteen Great Emperors, there are masters of the ten sanctuaries. For instance, Purple Moon Great Emperor of Purple Moon Sanctuary, Colored Glaze Emperor of Colored Glaze Sanctuary, East Royal Emperor from East Royal Sanctuary… Besides the ten sanctuaries, there are three other Great Emperors. Although the three Great Emperors didn’t conquer any sanctuaries, their individual powers are enough to shake one.”

“Among the three Great Emperors, one of them is Emperor Bai.”

“Emperor Bai also has another title. He is the strongest man in Sanctuary Alliance!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The strongest man in Sanctuary Alliance?

The title was definitely highly valuable.

Hall Master paused and continued, “Regardless of Sir Gods or Emperor Gods, there is a distance of power in-between. Same applies to Great Emperors.”

“Among the thirteen Emperor Gods in Sanctuary Alliance, Emperor Bai is no doubt the number one. His power was widely recognized long ago.”

“Many years ago, at the beginning when Sanctuary Alliance first established, Emperor Bai launched an attack before. He did it in front of the experts and he killed another Great Emperor with a thunderous method.”

“Killed another Great Emperor?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Jian Wushuang, you should know that when one reaches Great Emperor level, he will be the strongest existence in Eternal Chaotic World. Since the collapse of ancient times and the first era, Eternal Chaotic World has never had anyone stronger than a Great Emperor while all the Great Emperors have the ability to split heaven and earth. They possess unbelievably strong power and their defensive skills are impressive.”

“Under normal circumstances, as both parties are Great Emperors, even if they couldn’t be evenly matched, they should be able to stay alive. Just like the other twelve Great Emperors in Sanctuary alliance, it would be difficult even for the strongest to kill the weakest. It is almost impossible. Only Emperor White has the capability to kill a Great Emperor and with ease!”

“Tell me now. Does Emperor Bai qualify to be the strongest man in Sanctuary Alliance?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Of course he’s qualified,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

He could kill another Great Emperor. That itself showed Emperor Bai’s power.

“Hall Master Yuan, as you brought up about Emperor Bai, would the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill be in the hands of this Emperor Bai?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You’re right. The seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, Emperor White should be the only one in Eternal World that has it. Because he is the one and only inverse cultivator at the Almighty level in Eternal Chaotic World!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang stood up and he looked surprised, “Emperor Bai is an inverse cultivator?”

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded, “Since the second era until now, there were some inverse cultivators but most of them died during inverse cultivation tests. There are only two people who passed all inverse cultivation tests and reached the sixth step of inverse cultivation, who are Real God Wu Bei and Emperor Bai.”

“Of course, you’re the third one now and you have already surpassed Real god Wu Bei. If you were to improve further, you might be able to stand side by side with Emperor Bai.

“It is also because Emperor Bai is an inverse cultivator. That’s why he is so ridiculously powerful and terrifying.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and he was astonished.

It was true. Inverse cultivators were ridiculous.

He was merely on the sixth step, the third stage of Ultimate Real God, but he was confident in being evenly matched with an ordinary Emperor God.

If he were to improve further, reach the seventh step of inverse cultivation, and become an Almighty, his fighting power would easily reach the Great Emperor level. If his comprehension of Heaven Way were to enhance slightly and reach the level to be compared favorably with an ordinary Great Emperor, he would be able to kill a Great Emperor of the same level with ease at his advantageous position as an inverse cultivator.

Emperor Bai had obviously reached that level.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s needless for me to tell you how amazing Emperor Bai is. His title as the strongest man in Sanctuary Alliance should reveal that. Emperor Bai is also an ancient existence. His antiquity is far beyond your imagination. There are even rumors that said that he is an expert from the first era. Such an ancient Almighty doesn’t have any relatives or disciples and is unrestrained.”

“Although he carries the name of alliance leader in Sanctuary Alliance, he never bothered about the internal affairs. Forget about Real God Wu Bei, even the Emperor Gods in Sanctuary Alliance and the Great Emperor experts on the highest position hardly see him. It is said that among the other twelve Great Emperors, only two of them have his communication token.”

“In other words, even Great Emperors find it difficult to look for him,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushaung’s face grew solemn after he heard that.

He definitely had to look for Emperor Bai if he wanted to get the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill. However, it wasn’t easy to look for him.
