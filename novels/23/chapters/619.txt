Chapter 620: Round One Rules!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Having witnessed the ferocious fight between the two geniuses from the Eternal World earlier, the Ancient World warriors were relieved that they wouldn’t fight Eternal World warriors in the first round.

Of course, while some were glad, others were disappointed.

“They are going to separate us in the first round, what a pity.”

“Hum, it seems I’ll only have a chance to challenge the geniuses from the Eternal World in the second round.”

“It will be very boring if there are no the Eternal World geniuses in the first round.”

The warriors who expressed disappointment were confident of their strength. They thought they were the real geniuses.

For instance, Jian Wushuang was one of the warriors who felt that the first round would be unchallenging.

“Now, all of you can enter the wormhole,” the middle-aged man said.

The geniuses and warriors rushed into their respective wormholes without hesitating.

The entry into the wormhole was relatively uneventful for the geniuses from the Eternal World. For the Ancient World,?tens of thousands of people swarmed into the wormhole like locusts.

Jian Wushuang also stepped into the wormhole without any hesitation.

Soon, he found that he was on a vast plain with a dense jungle, some high mountains and rivers.

Jian Wushuang glanced around the plain and noticed people standing near him.

All of these people were at the Skyscraping Realm in the Ancient World. They had just stepped into the wormhole and were very curious about this area.

“All scattered?”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

On this seemingly endless plain, there were numerous warriors but they were all scattered.

“Hum?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly. There was a token in his right hand that was emitting a unique power but he didn’t understand its purpose.

“What’s the first round of the genius battle and what are the rules?” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

Right at this moment...

“Listen!”

The middle-aged man’s voice echoed clearly above the entire plain.

“In first round of the genius battle, what you need to do is to kill others!”

“As for the rules that are used to judge if you can pass this round... I’m sorry to tell you there are no rules!”

“All of you are scattered over the plain. What you need to do is try your best to kill all the people around you and display your strength. Easy! We will announce the result when the time is right.”

Hearing this, all the warriors from the Ancient World were stunned.

No judgment rules?

They would display their strength and get the results at the end?

It seemed strange to everyone except Jian Wushuang, who understood that having no rules was the rule.

No one knew the judgment rules, so no one would be confident of the result. Everyone would be nervous, so they would try their best to kill their opponents and display their strength.

“Each of you has a token now. That is your safety token. When your life is threatened, it will defend you against the attack but you will also be immediately banished from the battlefield and disqualified from the feast.”

“That means you don’t need to worry about your safety here.”

The middle-aged man’s voice still echoed in the void.

The people on the battlefield finally understood the purpose of the token.

“Now I declare that the first round of the Firmament Territory Feast has begun!” the middle-aged man announced and his voice gradually faded away.

Abruptly, the plain erupted in riots.

“No rule, so it’s based on your strength to kill as many people as possible!”

“That means I have to kill others instead of hiding!”

“The more people I kill, the greater strength I display. Then I will have a good chance to pass this round.”

Jian Wushuang squinted as his right hand slowly stretched towards his Heart-killing Sword.

At the same time, he noticed there were more than ten Skyscraping Realm warriors nearby. They were all observing this area with strong killing intents.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

After the two successive howls, one person made his move and triggered the rest to begin attacking.

Without reason or logic, they tried their best to kill as many people as they could on the battlefield.

Everyone on the battlefield was an enemy.

The rampant killing broke out in the blink of an eye.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Powerful roars resounded through the void as killings took place all over the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang was solemn. He glanced around him as he held his Heart-killing Sword.

“Go to hell!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

An aquamarine-hair woman with a ferocious look popped up beside Jian Wushuang. Her soft sword swiftly cut towards his throat like a lightning flash.

She had already comprehended Gale Dao, so its speed was extremely fast.

“Hum,” Jian Wushuang snorted, then thrust his sword in her direction.

His speed was at least several times faster than the woman’s. It was also sneaky and full of killing intent. His attack was launched after the woman’s, but it reached its destination earlier, at the front of her throat.

“How is that possible?” the aquamarine-hair woman looked terrified. Her words died as Jian Wushuang’s longsword cut her throat.

Her token was broke and blocked Jian Wushuang’s attack. It emitted a shining light covering the woman and sent her out of the battlefield.

Outside the Drill Ground, the aquamarine-hair woman appeared again. She looked around and smiled bitterly, “My strength is ranked third in the Ancient World. I never expected to be defeated by my first opponent in the first round of the genius battle.”

As Jian Wushuang had ‘killed’ the woman with only one attack, all attention on the battlefield was drawn to him.

“There are still 13 people around me, I need to kill all of them.”

His eyes turned cold and his figure swept out violently.
