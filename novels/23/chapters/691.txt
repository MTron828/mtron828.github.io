Chapter 692: Annihilation Sword Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Are you really going to play hardball?” Hu Hu’s eyes sparkled with a hint of pleasure.

Though Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was exquisite, Hu Hu was confident in his own power as a superior Divine Realm expert.

“Boy, since you want to die, I’ll help you fulfill your wish.”

As soon as Hu Hu finished his words, red clouds burst out from his body and vast power surged crazily toward his hands. After he exerted his Secret Skill’s power, he lifted the axe high with both hands.

Jian Wushuang also raised his Emperor Sword while a mighty Sword Essence burst out from him.

“Last stroke!”

“I’ve comprehended this sword move for a long time, but I’ve never used it in battle before. You’re the first to see it.”

Jian Wushuang stared at Hu Hu while mighty power accumulated in the Emperor Sword and his Sword Essence became stronger and stronger.

When the Sword Essence had accumulated to its peak, a shocking light burst out from Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“The first Move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, Annihilation Sword Move!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and then directly swung the Emperor Sword whose power had reached its peak.

Boom!

The air was separated immediately and the whole castle trembled at this moment. The sword shadow left a huge sword scar on the ground which was so wide and deep that no one could see the bottom of it.

The sword stroke could destroy the whole world.

It was the First Move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

Jian Wushuang comprehended this sword move three years ago. He had kept it as a trump card and had never displayed it in front of anyone.

Until this moment.

Hu Hu slashed with his Giant Axe simultaneously.

The slash was so powerful that it seemed that it could cut through mountains. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The huge Axe Shadow carried mighty power, ready to destroy everything in the world.

Hu Hu’s face turned scarlet and his eyes were full of madness. Obviously, this axe stroke was the strongest one he was able to display.

Both of them operated their strongest move and the two overwhelming attacks collided with each other.

BANG!

With the loud boom, huge ripples of energy swept around violently in the Void where the collision happened, destroying everything around. In the hall, decorations, wine pots, wine cups, tables and chairs, and even stone walls were crushed into dust by the ripples which were rapidly spreading.

If someone watched from the outside, he would find that a horrifying power had erupted at the core of the huge Amethyst castle. Then the whole castle began to collapse from the core at an alarming speed.

Boom… The whole world seemed to be shaking.

The shaking lasted for dozens of breaths, and finally, everything calmed down.

The Amethyst castle which had stood for thousands of years had disappeared, leaving only ruins and dust all over the place.

In the middle of the ruins, a man was standing there, Jian Wushuang.

His face was a little pale, and there was a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth. He gently coughed and slowly resheathed the Emperor Sword. Then he stepped forward and stopped at a broken corpse.

It was Hu Hu.

In the collision, Jian Wushuang’s sword stroke defeated Hu Hu’s Axe Shadow and then smashed half of Hu Hu’s body. Hu Hu died on the spot.

“The power of Boundless Heaven Sword Art is extremely terrifying. With my current Sword Principle Cultivation, I can only display the First Move, Annihilation Sword Move, but its power is still far beyond the Secret Skills I created,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

After he mastered the First Move, he had regarded it as his trump card, as it was too powerful.

For example, the Violet Calamity Sword Skill created by him was also very powerful, but it was much weaker than the Annihilation Sword Move.

He chose to have a head-on confrontation with Hu Hu due to this trump card.

He knew Hu Hu could not resist this sword move even if he was a superior Divine Realm expert.

Hu Hu was directly killed by this sword move, indeed.

Of course, powerful as this sword move was, it was also demanding, especially in the aspects of Spiritual Power. Though Jian Wushuang had a fierce fight with Hu Hu, he used at most 20 percent of his Spiritual Power. But once he operated the Annihilation Sword Move, he immediately consumed 30 percent of his Spiritual Power.

That was to say, his Spiritual Power could only support him to use Annihilation Sword Move three times, and then it would be exhausted.

“Hm, it seems that I’d better use Boundless Heaven Sword Art less in the future,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Anyway, he had already killed Hu Hu. As his 11 targets had been killed, his mission was completed.

In addition, through the battle with Hu Hu, he had a very clear understanding of his own strength.

He was slightly stronger than the advanced Divine Realm experts up to now. He could compete with a superior Divine Realm expert in a head-on confrontation, and even have the chance to defeat and even kill him.

Of course, there were also strong and weak superior Divine Realm experts.

Hu Hu was only a weak one, while some superior Divine Realm experts were extremely powerful, such as the Vice Palace Masters in the Dao Palace. Jian Wushuang knew that any Vice Palace Master could kill Hu Hu easily.

“My comprehension of Dao is still shallow. At present, I’m not qualified to cultivate those Secret Skills which can greatly enhance my offensive power. If I can improve my comprehension of Dao a little, World Dao or Slaughter Dao, and master five Occults, I’ll have more assurance in the face of the superior Divine Realm experts,” Jian Wushuang murmured, clenching his fists.

He did not stay in the ruins for long. After collecting Hu Hu’s body and weapon, he left directly.

He did not discover that a young man was standing quietly in the Void near the ruins.

That was a demonic youth with scarlet hair, holding a longsword on his back.
