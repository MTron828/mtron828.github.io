Chapter 1618: Beating The Drum 24 Times

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the martial arts battlefield, many ancient gods were overwhelmed by the great pressure, but they didn’t give up.

Jian Wushuang also appeared to be struggling, but he was actually faking it.

With his strength and mind power, Jian Wushuang could easily handle it even if a six-star silver-armored Ancient God released the pressure solely toward him. To him it was like a piece of cake.

Bang!

Many competitors fell down.

Just a moment later, half of the Ancient Gods failed the game and quit.

The rest of the participants, except Jian Wushuang, were all struggling with great difficulty.

At that moment, the great pressure dissipated all of a sudden. All of the competitors felt relieved. They were so tired that they laid down and panted heavily.

Jian Wushuang was still standing and appeared red in the face.

There was only one person still standing in addition to Jian Wushuang. He was two meters tall and had eyes filled with golden light. The man was looking at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“He is the only one who is standing as I do. He seems highly strong,” the young man muttered.

“The first round of the game has ended. Competitors who have passed can have a rest for half an hour, and the second round will begin.” A powerful god was presiding over the game.

The people who passed the first round of tests on the battlefield immediately took time to recover. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After half an hour, the ancient gods had almost restored their power to their peaks.

At that time, the eight ancient gods carried a huge drum and slowly walked towards the battlefield.

“The drums?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“This is Myriad Beasts Drum, the unique drum of the ancient gods,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Except Jian Wushuang, other competitors apparently had a clear idea of what the drum was.

“I don’t think I should say anything more about the second round, given that you are all familiar with Myriad Beasts drum. Every candidate goes to beat the drum one by one, and he beats as many times as possible,” the God presiding over the game said.

The First Ancient God came forward.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The ancient god beat three times in the beginning, and the sound was thunderous. Then he apparently slowed down but kept going. After twelve times, the ancient god tried to knock again, but this time, when the drumsticks knocked on the drums, there was no sound.

“It is not a good performance.” King of Venomous Worms commented.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang wondered how much he could achieve.

He didn’t think that the drum was easy to beat.

After that, one Ancient God after another came forward and knocked on the drum, but most of them beat only thirteen to eighteen times. The best candidate was the two-meter-tall young man, who beat twenty-one times.

The first Ancient God to beat over twenty times.

After the young man beat twenty times, the host could not help but nod at him slightly to show his appreciation.

Finally, it was Jian Wushuang’s turn.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang came in front of the drum.

“Jian Wushuang, the Beast King Drum is not uncommon in the Ancient God Sanctuary. Not only the Gu King City, but also some of the ancient god tribes have the existence of their Beast King Drums, so these participants must have beat the drum many times. They know how to control the power properly, but you are different. It is the first time for you to beat the drum. So spare no efforts to beat the drum by using your Ancient God Power.”

“OK,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang took the drumsticks and started to generate his Ancient God Power.

“Boom!”

The first time Jian Wushuang beat the Beast King Drum, he realized that he couldn’t act as coherently as the other Ancient Gods. After only one stroke, he had to pause for a while, but the drum put out a heavy sound.

He felt a great resistance force when he was beating.

“It seems that I have to counter the great force in order to beat the drum.”

“Hey!””Hey!””Hey!””Hey!”

After four consecutive beats, Jian Wushuang felt that the resistance was getting stronger and stronger.

“Just do your best.”

Jian Wushuang then generated his Ancient god power to the limit, followed by several sounds of the drum beating.

The drum was resounding in this martial arts field.

After a while, Jian Wushuang had beat for twenty times.

The resistance of the drum had reached an extremely high level, and Jian Wushuang had to admit that he couldn’t use his power properly. “In fact, I once beat the Beast King Drum when I didn’t have that much Ancient God Power and I know that I don’t need to use so much Ancient God Power. At least 50% of my power is wasted.” Jian Wushuang shook his head smilingly but he didn’t care that much actually.

Anyway, he continued to use the rest of his power to beat the drum.

“Hey!””Hey!””Hey!””Hey!”

Another four beats. When the fifth beat was made, Jian Wushuang was completely exhausted. The drumsticks tapped on the drum, but there was no sound.

Jian Wushuang’s final result was twenty-four.

“Jian Wushuang, with the high purity of your blood lineage and the Ancient God Power you have, if you knew how to use your power properly and didn’t waste so much power, you could have completely finished beating even thirty times.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Haha, indeed, but it doesn’t matter, as long as I can pass this game.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Many Ancient Gods participating in the game, including the youth with golden eyes who had beaten the drum twenty-one times, all widened their eyes and looked at the sword with amazement.
