4658 Becoming an Ancestor Realm Expert While Lying Down

Cosmos God’s eyes were filled with relief and heartache as he helped Jian Wushuang up.

“You’ve matured,” Cosmos God said emotionally. “You’ve already grown from a Young Friend who listened to the Dao in the Cloud Palace to a true Cosmos God.”

Jian Wushuang laughed bitterly, “The world has changed. I’ve been away for over 500,000 years. I don’t know what will happen to the Divine Power Universe in the meantime.”

Upon hearing this, Cosmos God smiled, “There’s no need to worry. The laws of the Great Dao are different. The 500,000 years that you have experienced might not be as long in another universe. You can still make it in time.”

He nodded thoughtfully. “It’s still not too late…”

“Go back. I’ll show you the way. The Divine Power Universe can’t do without you.” With a smile, Cosmos God extended his withered palm and pointed in a certain direction.

Jian Wushuang said anxiously, “Teacher, now that I have seen you in the space-time turbulence, how can you not return with me? The Divine Power Universe needs you.”

Cosmos God shook his head slowly, “I can’t go back anymore. My life source has already dried up. If I hadn’t been waiting for your arrival here, I would have died long ago.”

As if to confirm his words, the figure of Cosmos God started to dim rapidly. He started to shatter from the bottom of his feet, just like countless stars scattering.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. He quickly released his divine power in an attempt to stabilize Cosmos God’s body. However, it was of no use.

“The last thing I can do is to send you back to the Divine Power Universe.” Cosmos God smiled and nodded. At the same time, he pushed Jian Wushuang away gently.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bloodshot. He looked at Cosmos God who had already disappeared into the space-time turbulence and knew that he could no longer go back.

Countless tiny rays of light gathered to form a river that extended into the distance.

After adjusting his dejected state of mind, Jian Wushuang leaped and ran into the distance.

The silver river formed by Cosmos God’s body finally stopped before a vortex before it dissipated completely.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang stepped into the vortex.

Countless rays of light rose and turned into thousands of ribbons.

He only felt an indescribable invisible restraint pressing down on his body. Then, he had an Epiphany. That was the Heavenly Dao law that belonged to the entire Divine Power Universe. Even if he reached the Ancestor realm, he could not defy it.

The darkness before his eyes instantly cleared up. In the blue starry sky, a figure dressed in a black Ranger’s outfit stood in the distance.

The surging divine power completely replenished his almost dried-up meridians, and the divine power derived from nearly a hundred Star Fields was supplied to him.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. The rules of Great Dao flowed around him, and the lightning snake floated above his head like a divine punishment. He looked extremely majestic.

He was worried that everything had changed.

After standing still for a long time, Jian Wushuang decided to face it.

As he traveled through the deserted star area, Jian Wushuang soon felt that something was wrong.

There was not a single trace of life in the nearly 10,000 Star Fields and Divine Kingdoms. One had to know that even the Star Fields in the extreme north of the universe had been explored.

However, how could there be no sects living in this Star Field with abundant divine power and no bad turbulence?

Could it be that in the years that he was gone, a tremendous change had already happened?

With doubts in his mind, Jian Wushuang flew across the starry sky. He wanted to rush to the extraterritorial battlefield to see his old friends and the unfinished business.

Finally, after crossing hundreds of millions of star areas, Jian Wushuang felt a Star Field Divine Kingdom with the aura of living beings.

He was close to a relatively prosperous and vast Star Field. It was filled with divine power and good luck, which was very suitable for cultivation.

Walking among the mountains, Jian Wushuang came to the biggest sect in the Divine Kingdom of the Star Field — the True Sword Sect.

There was some history between them. During the battle of the Great Catastrophe War, the True Sword Sect sent out seven Supreme realm experts. Their Sect Master, Elder Yue Zhi, was a Half Invincible Supreme martial artist, and had a brief discussion with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang went straight to the True Sword Sect. However, he found it strange that there was not a single Ultimate Ruler realm expert among the hundreds of thousands of disciples in the Divine Kingdom.

“Who is it, and why are you here?” a red-lipped, white-teethed boy holding a sword walked out from behind the mountain Gate and asked Jian Wushuang curiously.

“I’m a disciple of the Divine Life Palace, and an old friend of your Sect Master. I’m here to ask about some things,” Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said.

The sword-wielding boy’s eyes flashed with a touch of sadness. Then he raised his head and said, “Senior, please go back. My Sect Master died in the Offworld Battlefield 200 years ago. Six Elders also died with him.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned. He sighed in his heart and finally said, “I see that your sect has almost no disciples at the Ultimate Ruler realm. Why is that?”

The sword-wielding boy continued, “The new Cosmos God has ascended and is calling for the entire universe. All Ultimate Rulers are to head to the Cangwu Platform and sit on praying mats to listen to his teachings. The remaining 100 or so Ruler realm Senior Brothers in my clan have already rushed there to listen to his teachings.”

When Jian Wushuang heard this, he was stunned for a moment. But he soon understood. During the period of time that he had disappeared, Lu Ding had claimed the position of the new Cosmos God.

Jian Wushuang had no objection to this. After all, the Divine Power Universe could not go a day without a master. Lu Ding was a generous, kind person and had the demeanor of a Lord. He was far more suitable to be Cosmos God than Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, opening up the Cangwu Platform’s prayer mats was a great act of kindness after the battle of the Great Catastrophe.

“In addition, I would like to ask you one more thing. How many years has it been since the last Great Catastrophe?” He asked, feeling a little apprehensive.

“About 200 years,” The sword-wielding boy said after some thought.

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “In that case, I won’t bother you anymore.”

The boy holding the sword lowered his head and smiled.

He took two steps back and stopped. Then, he turned around to face the entire True Sword Sect and sprinkled down a layer of vast divine power halo.

The sword-wielding boy felt warm all over his body. Then, the layers of shackles in his body were broken, and his divine power rose crazily like bamboo shoots after a rain.

A pillar of red light rose up and dyed the space around him a dozen miles. Everything was shrouded in a hazy divine power.

This red-lipped and white-teethed sword-wielding boy had shed his mortal body and entered the Supreme realm.

With a ‘plop’” he fell to the ground in a daze, then stood up and looked into the distance.

In the misty clouds, there was no trace of the newcomer.

Above the starry sky, Jian Wushuang looked back at the True Sword Sect and then smiled helplessly.

“I’m already at the Ancestor realm, huh…”

He had slept for 600000 years under the vast universe and reached the Ancestor realm when he returned to the Divine Power Universe.

Only 200 years had passed, so there was still time.
