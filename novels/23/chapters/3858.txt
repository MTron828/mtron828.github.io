Chapter 3861: The Strongest Trump Card

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Demon Monarch Ancient Night initially wanted to capture Jian Wushuang alive.

After all, Jian Wushuang was a real super genius, one that might not even exist in the billions of Star Worlds.

Such a Super Genius was priceless. If he could take him under his wing, he would receive incredible benefits.

However, with Jian Wushuang’s current strength, it was impossible for him to capture him alive. Therefore, he could only settle for the second best and kill Jian Wushuang.

He knew that if Jian Wushuang, a Principles Master, could have such battle strength in such a remote Star Field, he must have gotten an incredible opportunity. The two rule supreme treasures in his hands clearly showed this, therefore, even if he could not take Jian Wushuang under his command, as long as he killed him and obtained his two rule supreme treasures, he believed that his gains would not be low.

“Blood Sword Master, you are indeed impressive to be able to force me to this point, but that’s it.” Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s eyes were cold. “Next, I’m going to use my strongest trump card. Even though I’ve been in that place for a long time, I’ve only used this move a dozen times. You should be proud to die under this move.”

As soon as Demon Monarch Ancient Night finished speaking, a large amount of black light began to condense on his body.

“Do you still have a trump card?”Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted, and he could not help but exclaim in his heart.

Demon Monarch Ancient Night had been able to survive in the Eternal Dark Prison, so his methods were indeed extraordinary. Even now, he still had a trump card that he had not used.

Moreover, Demon Monarch Ancient Night had fought with him for a long time and had some understanding of his strength, but he still dared to say that this move had the chance to kill him. It was obvious that the power of this move was extraordinary.

“Ha!”

Demon Monarch Ancient Night suddenly shouted in a low voice. The Aura on his body suddenly weakened greatly, and he spat out a mouthful of hot blood.

“It’s a special secret skill, and the price for him to use this secret skill is definitely not small.”Jian Wushuang’s face was solemn. When he sensed that Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s aura had weakened greatly, he knew that this move was not trivial.

Boom!

Demon Monarch Ancient Night made his move.

A large amount of dark light condensed at a terrifying speed, and in the blink of an eye, it formed an ancient black giant finger.

The giant black finger carried an earth-shaking destructive power and directly came toward Jian Wushuang’s finger.

“This move!”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly constricted. He could feel the terrifying power contained in this move.

If the battle strength of Demon Monarch Ancient Night was at the peak of the second level, then the power of the finger that he had used at great cost was definitely beyond the second level, it had reached the third level, and it was probably at the Advanced Ruler level.

“Haha, this move is a secret skill from my sect. It was created by a supreme-being. Its power is extremely powerful. I used 40% of my divine power and part of my blood essence to barely use this move. I don’t believe that he can resist it.”Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s eyes were cold.

However, under his gaze, Jian Wushuang suddenly burst out with overwhelming divine power.

Boom! Divine power swept wildly. In the next moment, it began to burn at a terrifying speed.

Dragon destruction secret skill, Divine Power Burning!

As the divine power burned, Jian Wushuang’s divine power instantly increased by 100 times. Under the amplification of various secret skills, his power had reached a new level.

“Earth Guard!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly waved the Divine Sword in his hand. Under the power of the universe principle, the Wu Qi Divine Sword also displayed extraordinary power. In an instant, a layer of Earth Sword Realm condensed in front of Jian Wushuang, in an instant, a total of 43 layers of Earth Sword Realm formed.

Yes, 43 layers.

After Jian Wushuang came out of the dusky demon realm, he stayed in the Red Cloud World for thousands of years. During those thousands of years, he used the opportunities in the Red Cloud World to improve his strength again, not just in the universe principle, his comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle and swordsmanship was even higher now. It could be said that he had reached the peak among the third-level masters.

With such comprehension of the universe origin of Sword Principle and full use of the Earth guard, he could instantly condense 43 levels of the Earth Sword Realm.

The 43 levels of the Earth Sword Realm were stronger and stronger,

boom!

The ancient giant black finger slowly extended and finally hit the Earth Sword Realm on the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body.

In an instant, the power burst out. The 43 levels of Earth Sword Realm and 30 levels of sword realm were like transparent window paper, directly pierced by the giant black finger. Then the giant black finger continued to attack, the 31st level, the 32nd level… in the blink of an eye, it defeated the first 39 levels.

However, when it reached the 40th level, the speed of the giant black finger obviously slowed down.

When it reached the 41st level, the giant black finger paused for a long time before it finally managed to break through.

As for the 42nd level, the giant black finger failed to defeat the 42nd level and dissipated.

The giant black finger finally stopped at the 42nd level.

“I used the Dragon Killing Secret Skill and the most powerful defensive sword skill, earth guard, under the premise of increasing my divine power, but I was also defeated by the first 41 levels of the sword realm. The power of this finger is really amazing.”Jian Wushuang could not help but exclaim.

Jian Wushuang was only exclaiming in admiration, but Demon Monarch Ancient Night was shocked, even terrified.

“How is it possible?”

“I used a lot of divine power and even sacrificed part of my blood essence to perform my strongest move. Even an ordinary third-level Primary Ruler in the Eternal Dark Prison would be severely injured by my move. He, a mere Principles Master, not only completely blocked my move, but also perfectly blocked it with his body-protecting sword skill. How could I fail to break his body-protecting sword skill?”

“How could he be so strong?”

Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s body and mind trembled.

Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes had already looked at Demon Monarch Ancient Night.

“Demon Monarch Ancient Night, you’ve already used your strongest move, so you can lend me another sword.”

Jian Wushuang slowly raised the Wu Qi Divine Sword in his hand. Under the crazy burning of divine power, he suddenly waved it.

In the next moment, a terrifying hazy sword shadow directly slashed out.

It was the most powerful sword skill, hazy!

It was the same sword skill, but Jian Wushuang, who had used the Dragon Killing Secret Skill, was much more powerful than before. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Not good!”

Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s expression changed greatly. He could tell at a glance that the power of the sword was extremely strong, at least at the threshold of the third level. Even in his heyday, he did not dare to take such a sword skill lightly, moreover, his divine power, blood essence, and battle prowess were greatly damaged. At most, he only had 60% of his peak strength.

60% of his strength, how could he dare to receive this sword?
