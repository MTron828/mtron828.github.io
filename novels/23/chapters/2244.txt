2245 Leave them to Me

No matter where the great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance were when they received the message from Emperor Bai, even those venturing within the Ancient Battlefield, they rushed to Thunderbolt Island with the help of wormholes.

Jian Wushuang, who was within the Green Fire World, also rushed down.

By the time Jian Wushuang reached Thunderbolt Island, most of the great emperors were already there.

“Sword Emperor!”

“Sword Emperor!”

The great emperors greeted Jian Wushuang with great respect.

“Emperor Bai, what is happening?” Jian Wushuang appeared beside Emperor Bai and asked.

“Look,” Emperor Bai said as he pointed at the space in front of him.

Jian Wushuang looked over and saw the twenty experts from the ancient past standing outside the formation.

These experts stopped attacking the formation, and those who excelled in formation started studying the formation.

Jian Wushuang saw Old Monster Jiao.

“It’s him. He is here for revenge?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and muttered.

“Yes, this is his revenge. He got the courage to come and attack Thunderbolt Island directly. He probably wants to destroy the headquarters of Sanctuary Alliance, or even destroy the alliance,” Emperor Bai.

“That’s all? He probably wants to kill you to take revenge for his ride,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course. Sadly, he is not powerful enough,” Emperor Bai said coldly and confidently.

In this world, he was unbeatable.

Based on power level alone, there might have been people such as Emperor Thirteen who could beat him in a fight...

However, it was near impossible for these people to kill him even though they were much more powerful than him.

A person in the Ultimate Phase of the Seventh-Step Inverse Cultivation possessed the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body. It was completely overpowered in this world.

“Even if he cannot kill Emperor Bai, destroying Sanctuary Alliance and killing the most powerful experts here is more than enough to extinguish his rage,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“I guess that’s what he thinks as well,” Emperor Bai said.

“Emperor Bai, Sword Emperor.” A voice was heard. It belonged to the Great Emperor Coloured Glaze.

“I met that man recently. I suspected that he was an expert from the ancient past. He is very powerful. I lost my courage to fight him when he looked at me,” the Great Emperor Coloured Glaze said in fear as he pointed at one of the experts from the ancient past.

Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang looked over in the direction that Great Emperor Coloured Glaze was pointing and noticed the man in purple hair and clothes who stood beside Old Monster Jiao.

“This man should have incredible fighting power,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

As his fighting power became stronger, Jian Wushuang’s ability to sense danger increased as well.

He could sense that the two most powerful men within the group of experts from the ancient past were the man in purple hair and clothes and Old Monster Jiao.

“These people are experts from the ancient past. From the power of their attacks on the formation, every one of them has the fighting power of a stage-three great emperor, some peak stage-three great emperor. There are a few that have yet to attack: Old Monster Jiao and this man with purple hair.”

“I have fought Old Monster Jiao before. His fighting power is higher than that of any stage-three great emperor and has barely reached the level of a stage four great emperor. The man with purple hair should not have been weaker than Old Monster Jiao, and both of them should be in Half-Step Divine Demon Realm.

“This man is really incredible. He can persuade twenty experts from the ancient past to help him in such a short period of time,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself, surprised.

Up to date, Sanctuary Alliance encountered minimal numbers of experts from the ancient past. Yet, Old Monster Jiao had managed to contact and convince more than twenty of such experts to help him take revenge. Of course he was incredible.

“This is troublesome. There are two men with the fighting power of a Half-Step Divine Demon and twenty experts with fighting power of a stage-three great emperor. Sanctuary Alliance cannot stop them!” Abysmal Saint Master said in a low voice.

Cannot stop them?

When the great emperors heard this phrase, they fell silent.

Indeed, the opponent lineup was far too terrifying.

These experts could not start a massacre due to the presence of the formation stopping them in their tracks. Once the formation broke, there was nothing else stopping them and there was no way the great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance could stop them.

The difference was far too great!

Among the great emperors, only Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang and his servant, Jian Yi, had the fighting power to stop these enemies. No one else had the fighting power of a stage-three great emperor.

How to bridge this huge gap in fighting power?

“Sword Emperor, can you ask Emperor Thirteen to help us?” Ancestor Tian Chen asked.

“Emperor Thirteen?” Jian Wushuang was stunned before shaking his head as he continued, “I have Emperor Thirteen’s transmission token and he might help us if I asked him to. However, he is from the ancient past and not from our era. If we ask him for help whenever Sanctuary Alliance encounters danger, then who are we within this alliance?”

“If we can’t even handle these experts from the ancient past, how can we call ourselves the masters of this era?”

The great emperors nodded their heads when they heard what Jian Wushuang had said.

Indeed, Emperor Thirteen was from the Ancient Past and had from this era. How could they expect Emperor Thirteen to always help them in times of need? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I have already commanded the experts on Thunderbolt Island to leave. We are the only people left on this island. If all else fails, we can only escape and abandon Thunderbolt Island and the resources here,” Emperor Bai frowned and said.

“We cannot back down,” Jian Wushuang shook his head firmly.

“There are more experts from the ancient past that have awakened. Most of them are hidden around the Eternal Chaotic World. They fear us because there is peace within this world.”

“If twenty experts from the ancient past are enough to force us to abandon the headquarters of Sanctuary Alliance and escape, these experts will lose the fear and will dare to do things without any limits.”

“These experts are incredibly powerful and many of them are extremely evil. If they no longer fear us, it will spell disaster for the Eternal Chaotic World. Hence, we cannot afford to retreat. Instead, we should defeat them quickly and swiftly! The best case is if we can kill at least half of these experts.”

“Kill at least half of these experts?” The great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance looked over at Jian Wushuang in shock.

They felt that there was no way they could defeat the opponent and they should retreat.

However, Jian Wushuang wanted to kill at least half of the experts from the ancient past?

“These experts from the ancient past are not as terrifying as you think. From my perspective, we have nothing to fear. Emperor Bai, the other great emperors will not interfere in this battle. The two of us have no problem in defeating them. The two most powerful experts they have are: the master of the black dragon and the man with purple hair and in purple clothes. With your fighting power, you will have no problem keeping them occupied whilst also having the upper hand,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes I can,” Emperor Bai nodded his head.

He fought the master of the black dragon before and knew how powerful he was.

If he used his full power, he could fight two Old Monster Jiao alone and still have the absolute advantage.

“That will be enough. You deal with the strongest two while I will deal with the remaining twenty experts who each have the fighting power of a stage-three great emperor,” Jian Wushuang said.
