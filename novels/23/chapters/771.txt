Chapter 772: Join Hands

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“These, these two…”

“Saber Master? One of the Two Masters from the Immortal Dynasty?”

“Old Weirdo Dream from the Boundless Demon Sect. Gosh, this old monster has disappeared for tens of thousands of years. She is still in the Firmament Territory?”

The other experts were familiar with the two new comers.

Both Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream were very famous in the Firmament Territory.

Saber Master was also called Slaughter Master, and he was second to their Sect Master. Although he was unable to transform into a Demon God, he had reached the peak of Level Three of Saber Heart in the Saver Principle. Aided by various skills, his battle strength was at Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

Old Weirdo Dream was a complete monster. No one knew how many years she had lived. With an incalculable number of skills, she was more terrifying than Saber Master.

“You actually lost to a little Divine Realm expert. Yun Fan, your reputation is destroyed by the boy.” Saber Master sneered.

“Humph, if you’re powerful, then go fight him. I really want to know how you will defeat him,” Yun Fan growled with a pale look.

Saber Master raised his eyebrows and could not help but spare the boy a glance with a flicker of gravity.

Jian Wushuang possessed a big secret which was appealing to the three magnates.

The two famous experts had received the news from their people, so they had immediately set off and arrived early to watch the fierce fight.

Both of them watched most of their fight and learnt about Jian Wushuang’s strength.

Saber Master only verbally mocked Yun Fan, as he knew he would probably lose the fight with Jian Wushuang

“OK, stop all these nonsense. This boy is extremely powerful. If we go for one-to-one, none of us can match him, so let’s join hands to fight him,” Old Weirdo Dream suggested.

“Join hands?” Saber Master’s expression changed. He said, “That’s not a problem, but what shall we do if we catch him?”

Old Weirdo Dream replied, “Let’s talk about it after we get him. As for his secret, we’ll work out a compromise. If not, we can share it.”

Yun Fan nodded. “Agree.”

“OK.” Saber Master also agreed with it.

After a while, the supreme experts at Step Four of the Eternal Realm had reached an agreement.

They had not lowered their voice, so everyone was able to hear their plan.

“Join hands?”

“Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream all join hands to deal with a Divine Realm expert?”

“Humph, Jian Wushuang already defeated Yun Fan, who is a bit stronger than the other two experts, so how will they get the better of him if they don’t work together?”

The experts started murmuring among themselves.

The nine Palace Masters in the Ancient Sect camp heard their conversation and were incandescent with rage.

“Bastard, the three monsters are already of such age. They’re actually joining hands to attack a Divine Realm junior. How shameful!” Vice Palace Master Ling Yu shouted.

The other Palace Masters were furious too, and were about to help Jian Wushuang.

However, Palace Master Destruction blocked them.

He said in a low voice, “I’ve sent a message to Palace Master Xuan Yi. He ordered us not to meddle in this.”

“What?” The other Palace Masters were shocked.

“Not meddle in this? Shall we just watch the three old monsters bully Jian Wushuang?” Palace Master Mo Tao shouted.

Palace Master Destruction replied, “I’m not certain, but you all know Xuan Yi’s patience. Since he ordered so, he must have his own plan. We can only obey it.”

Upon hearing this, the other Palace Master had to restrain themselves from helping this boy, despite them being furious.

On the battleground, Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream had already come to a consensus. They stood side by side in front of Jian Wushuang while locking their gaze on him.

“Join hands?”

Seeing what was happening, Jian Wushuang still wore a cold expression.

He knew deep down that once he started to attack, he would not be dealing with just the Cloud Sea Asgard, there would be the other opponents waiting for him. Hence, he was not surprised.

“So what?”

Jian Wushuang shot out a cold gaze. His Sword Essence did not become weaker. Instead, it became even more terrifying as if it was going to ruin everything.

Nothing could stop him! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Fight!”

With a stern growl, Jian Wushuang’s big figure charged forward again.

“Hehe, he knows that he’s fighting against three, but he’s still not backing out. Instead, he is taking the initiative to start attacking. He’s so bold!” Saber Master saw the boy rushing towards him. A hint of excitement shone across his eyes. “Let me see how powerful you are!”

As he spoke, he took a step forward.

It was just one step, but he instantly glided across a distance of 1,000 feet and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. After which, he raised his saber.

Saber Master was famous for his Saber Technique.

He was obsessed with his saber and also had ultimate confidence.

As he brandished his weapon, a saber shadow which was huge enough to cover half of the sky suddenly appeared. It slashed at the boy without mercy, like a hurricane.

The terrifying power shook the heaven and earth.

There was a faint dark golden light glistening in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Just when Saber Master swung his saber, Jian Wushuang also swung his Emperor Sword without holding back.

It was a clean sweep.

This strike looked like it could sweep across the whole sky.

It instantly collided into the huge saber shadow.

Shua… The terrifying power from the collision cut the air open and seemed to cause cracks in the void.

However, this collision only lasted for a while before the saber shadow was shattered into pieces.

Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow, however, violently flashed across the sky and hit on a mountainat the back.

Swish!

It ruthlessly cleft the mountain and cut it into two parts.

“This boy’s strength is brilliant.” Saber Master marveled at it.

“He is a Gold-armored Demon God. It’s no surprise that he has a superb strength.” Old Weirdo Dream glanced at Saber Master and then darted forward. “Watch my move!”
