“It’s my pleasure as well, clan leaders.” Jian Wushuang waved slightly and the three clan leaders stood up straight.

“Situ Clan Leader, please step aside,” said Jian Wushuang.

Situ Yuan understood immediately and walked to the side.

After that, Jian Wushuang looked at Shi Qianhan and the Wu Clan Leader with great interest. “I wonder, why are both of you here?”

Shi Qianhan and the Wu Clan Leader looked at each other. Shi Qianhan then took a deep breath and solemnly said, “Master Jian Yi. There may have previously been a little misunderstanding between the Shi Clan and Master Jian Yi. I’m here to sincerely apologize and congratulate you on succeeding the Territorial Lord position after killing San Shouwang.”

Shi Qianhan took out an Interspatial Ring before sending it to Jian Wushuang and said, “The Master behind Shi Clan already knows about this and told me to send you a message that he wishes to personally visit when he’s back to the Northern Darkstar Territory.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed slightly.

Shi Qianhan was very smart. He first prepared and took out a generous gift to apologize before mentioning the Peak Earth Ultimate God backing Shi Clan. His method of employing both soft and hard approaches was rather smart.

“Wu Clan Leader, what about you?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Wu Clan Leader.

The Wu Clan Leader was a graceful woman dressed in black. The graceful woman was charming as she glanced at Jian Wushuang and slowly said, “The Wu Clan is also here to congratulate Master Jian Yi. We hope you will accept this gift which we have prepared.”

Shi Qianhan and the Wu Clan Leader each took out an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang took a glance at the rings and secretly nodded.

The two big clans were indeed generous. The 200,000 Primordial Stones in the Interspatial Ring was indeed a great gift.

“Both of you may have misunderstood. Although I’ve killed San Shouwang, it’s still unknown whether I will become the Territorial Lord. As for these two Interspatial Rings, I’ll gladly accept your kind gesture.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and kept the two Interspatial Rings before saying, “Well, I shall invite both of you to a banquet after my position as the Territorial Lord has been confirmed.”

Shi Qianhan and the Wu Clan Leader were a little startled.

They could both read between the lines and knew what Jian Wushuang meant—they would certainly have to prepare another generous gift when they were invited to the banquet.

“Shi Clan Leader, let’s forget about the misunderstanding between us.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“In that case, both of us will excuse ourselves.”

Shi Qianhan and the Wu Clan Leader did not linger around and left.

“Situ Clan Leader.” Jian Wushuang looked at Situ Yuan again. “How’s your Situ Clan?”

“Thanks to the Master who killed San Shouwang, the Situ Clan’s crisis has resolved. The Situ Clan wants to thank you for this huge favor and has also prepared a special gift.” Situ Yuan also took out an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang glanced at it but did not accept. Instead, he smiled faintly. “Situ Clan Leader, your clan has been kind to me. I have to give you credit for helping me in successfully killing San Shouwang. You don’t have to give me this gift. After my position as the Territorial Lord is confirmed, you may prepare a small gift for me at the time I throw a big banquet.”

Jian Wushuang needed a lot of Primordial Stones so he did not refuse any generous gifts from the clans.

However, he did not accept everyone’s gifts such as the Situ Clan who had been kind to him and previously joined forces together with him. Jian Wushuang thought there was no need for them to show such gestures.

Situ Yuan did not insist and left after thanking Jian Wushuang again.

“Okay, all of you should go too.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the four commanders as well as Xiao Tiexin left the hall.

Jian Wushuang was the only one standing there alone. He then waved his hand and caused an Interspatial Ring to appear in his hand.

That was San Shouwang’s Interspatial Ring!

San Shouwang had been the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord for so many years and was good at accumulating wealth. His accumulated wealth over the years must be impressive.

Jian Wushuang was curious at San Shouwang’s Interspatial Ring and had quite a high expectation regarding its contents.

Jian Wushuang instantly used his soul power to scan through the ring.

Jian Wushuang knitted his brows together after seeing its contents.

“Three hundred thousand? There are only three hundred thousand Primordial Stones in San Shouwang’s Interspatial Ring?”

The 300,000 Primordial Stone might be an extremely huge number for an ordinary clan within the Northern Darkstar Territory. However, it was possible to fork out under desperate conditions despite being a rather huge number.

Any small clan’s total assets within the Northern Darkstar Territory were far more than 300,000 Primordial Stones.

Let alone those big clans.

San Shouwang was a Territorial Lord who had also destroyed the Xiao Clan not long ago. He even sold The Stately Painting to Star Picking Pavilion and received 2,000,000 Primordial Stones in return, yet there were only 300,000 left in his Interspatial Ring which was too little.

“It seems what Cang Heng said was true. San Shouwang had probably been busy accumulating his wealth to purchase the secret technique he was practicing. That secret technique must be the Divine Destructive Beast.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand over as four jade slips appeared in his hand. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All four jade slips recorded information on the same secret technique—Divine Destructive Beast.

The difference between those four jade slips was the recorded four different Divine Destructive Beast volumes.

Jian Wushuang began studying the four secret technique volumes which took more than half a day to study.

Finally, Jian Wushuang had some results.

“Indeed, this secret technique is very powerful as its creator was a top-tier Undying Saint. The Undying Saint equipped with this powerful secret technique may not be unrivaled among Undying Saints but not many were capable to be his match. This secret technique is very useful for cultivators below the Undying Saint realm,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

“It’s a pity this secret technique is only practical for those who are good in the Destruction Law.”

Jian Wushuang was rather disappointed.

The secret technique was powerful and versatile. It can be both an attack or defense technique but was based on the Destructive Law.

He was good at Space-time Law and Transmigration Law. Therefore, he was not suitable to practice the secret technique.

“These four Divine Destructive Beast secret technique volumes are very precious. The wealth accumulated by San Shouwang over the years might have been used on procuring these four secret technique volumes, but they are of very little use to me. If chanced upon, I’ll try to sell these four secret technique volumes. I should be able to exchange it for a lot of Primordial Stones,” said Jian Wushuang.
