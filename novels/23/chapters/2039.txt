Chapter 2040 Won The Be

In the hall, there was only Emperor Bai and Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger.

“Mister Emperor Bai.”

Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Emperor Bai in confusion. Just as everyone left, Emperor Bai sent him a message in private for him to stay back. It was obvious that Emperor had something in mind that he wanted to see him in private.

“Jiu Qiao, let me ask you. Did you see Sword Emperor and Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s passing with your own eyes?” Emperor Bai fixed his gaze upon Emperor Jiu Qiao.

“I didn’t,” Emperor Jiu Qiao shook his head. “However, Great Emperor Zhi Luo paid a great price to open up the spacetime tunnel. It was impossible for her to open it for the second time. They were fighting against thirteen Great Emperors in Imperial Peak. Sword Emperor and Great Emperor Zhi Luo stood almost no chance of survival.”

“And there is no reply from their communications tokens.”

Emperor Jiu Qiao’s judgment was in accordance.

In such a situation, it would be unrealistic if Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo wanted to stay alive.

Emperor Bai creased his eyebrows and said, “You said that Jian Wushuang sent you another message not long after you ran out of Imperial Peak?”

“Yes, he told me to stay in Three-Emperors World. Don’t leave in a hurry,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

“Is that so?” Emperor Bai nodded. “Alright then. That’s it.”

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao didn’t understand what Emperor Bai was trying to ask but he didn’t think further. He left very quickly.

In the hall, only Emperor Bai was sitting there alone. There was a strange emotion shimmering in his eyes.

Just as everyone was certain that Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo died, he was in doubt.

After all, he was also an inverse cultivator. He knew clearly how powerful one in the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill was. Although Jian Wushuang was only in stage one, it wouldn’t be easy to kill him. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had many powerful trump cards to hand. Besides, he also had a Seven Treasure Divine Elixir.

“Young man, I hope that you are still alive.”

Emperor Bai muttered and there was hope in his eyes.

…

In Imperial Peak in Three-Emperors World.

In the middle of the three statues, the huge golden whirlpool resumed normal operation.

The entire golden whirlpool was huge but it had recovered from the damage done during the battle. There was almost no scar left behind.

If there was any remaining sign, it was still filled with divine power and aura in every corner of the golden whirlpool.

The divine power and aura were powerful. From the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World’s point of view, the divine power and aura would disperse over time.

However, just as everyone redirected their attention from the golden whirlpool, the remaining divine power and aura slowly started to gather at the core of the golden whirlpool, the divine power that scattered all around the golden whirlpool started substantiating as well.

After a short while, there was a human figure that appeared in the golden whirlpool.

He lifted his head and there was a cold-looking young face. It was Jian Wushuang, who had passed away!!!

He was still alive!!!

Jian Wushuang stood in the depth of the golden whirlpool and reined in all his aura while he looked around himself.

Then, there was still a divine power that was moving back to him from the surrounding aura. Just as the divine power gathered, Jian Wushuang’s divine body completed the reorganization. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, there seemed to be less than ten percent of divine power left.

“It seems that I won the bet.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and his eyes beamed with joy.

After countless life-and-death trials, he had been through countless dangers and hopeless situations.

The more hopeless the situation was, the calmer he was, the more accurate his judgment would be.

And he had the guts to take the risk, to gamble!

Now, it was considered a great bet to him!

In the previous battle, he had been besieged by thirteen Great Emperors and there was a great formation that isolated Imperial Peak. He had no chance of escaping. In such a situation, there was only one way for him to survive. It was for everyone to think he was dead!!

In short, he had played dead.

However, how difficult would it be to fool all thirteen Great Emperors? Ordinary people wouldn’t have been able to pull it off.

However, Jian Wushuang, who was an inverse cultivator, who possessed a perfect Chaotic divine body, could.

Hence, he had intentionally let his divine body grow in size and reach about ten thousand zhang tall.

He did so because he would look like he was acting out of madness to damage the golden whirlpool. In actual fact, his goal was to spread his divine power wider after his divine body collapsed. It’d be best if his divine power could scatter all around the golden whirlpool under the power of the energy storm.

Then, he had abundant divine power but he didn’t repair his divine power to repair his divine body when he was attacked by the thirteen Great Emperors. It was so that he could create a scene where his aura grew weaker and collapsed in the end.

Then, the thirteen Great Emperors wouldn’t be suspicious.

Hence, the scene that Jian Wushuang had imagined in his head was realized. His ten-thousand-zhang-tall divine body couldn’t take the mad attacks of the thirteen Great Emperors and it finally collapsed. The enormous amount of his divine power scattered all around. When the energy storm swept out, his divine power was scattered to every corner of the golden whirlpool. Hence, it had led to the remainder of Jian Wushuang divine power and aura all over the golden whirlpool.

If it was anywhere else, such as a spacious void, the thirteen Great Emperors absolutely would take Jian Wushuang’s remaining divine power and he would vanish. However, they were in the golden whirlpool. The golden whirlpool was too important to Three-Emperors World and the coverage of his divine power was too wide. Hence, the thirteen Great Emperors couldn’t take it entirely. Hence, they could only let his divine power lie around in the golden whirlpool and wait for it to disperse on its own.

The thirteen Great Emperors left after they had repaired the golden whirlpool.

From the beginning until the end, the Great Emperors had never suspected that Jian Wushuang was still alive.

It was impossible that they would suspect it because Jian Wushuang’s divine body had collapsed in front of them. The thirteen of them had seen it clearly. Under such circumstances, any ordinary cultivator would be utterly dead.

However, they weren’t informed about how terrifying an inverse cultivator was.

Nor did they know the true power that a seventh step in inverse cultivation possessed.

Hence, Jian Wushuang had survived.

He had won the bet.

He relied on his perfect Chaotic divine body and his disguise to fool the thirteen Great Emperors.

Then, after everything had stabilized and the thirteen Great Emperors were no longer concerned about the golden whirlpool, Jian Wushuang reorganized his divine power and recovered his divine body.

The Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World had no idea about it.
