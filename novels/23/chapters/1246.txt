Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of clashes sounded throughout the Void.

The hurricane of madness swept through and lasted only for a few seconds. After that, the gale died down.

During a few seconds, Jian Wushuang did his best to strike 136 times.

Every blow was at its fullest power, and every strike was accompanied by a Soul Attack and the power of the Stars.

The Jin Kingdom desperately fended off 135 times but missed the lasts strike. It was this last blow that pierced his head.

“Am I going to die?”

The Jin Kingdom monarch’s head was penetrated, and the Life Core in the skull was instantly crushed. He gradually fell silent.

Before he died, he still couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang with eyes full of resentment, and amazement.

He had been in the Eternal Chaotic World for a long time, knowing how dangerous the world was, and that he would end up dead some day. But, he never thought of dying in the hands of a Universe Master in a small Chaotic World of the Eternal Chaotic World!

Clang… His last consciousness disappeared, and his body slowly fell to the ground.

Jian Wushuang stopped his body. He released immense power to shattered his body into dust and fetched his Interspatial Ring.

In addition, Jian Wushuang took the unowned Flame Deity Puppet that stood still on the spot when the Jin Kingdom monarch died.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang let out a heavy sigh of relief.

At the edge of the battlefield, experts from two camps who witnessed his killing the Jin Kingdom monarch were all stunned.

The Green Fire World soldiers were, otherwise, elated.

The remaining Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom were all dumbfounded.

“The lord… died?”

“Jian Wushuang killed the lord?”

“We, we…”

The Jin Kingdom Universe Masters all froze there.

But at this moment, someone looked at them coldly.

Then Jin Kingdom Univers Masters were all stunned. They noticed Jian Wushuang’s gaze and the Killing Intent in his eyes.

They immediately realized that Jian Wushuang was not going to let them off!

“Run!”

A Jin Kingdom Universe Master escaped, and at the same time, shouted to warn others. In Jian Wushuang’s eyes, he detected something bad.

Following him, other Jin Kingdom Universe Masters also fled.

They fled in all directions, even dived into under the ground. They had used all their skills to flee.

They desperately fled.

They knew that if they stayed, they would all be killed by Jian Wushuang.

The Jin Kingdom had died in the hands of Jian Wushuang. If they stayed, they would all be slaughtered by Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushaung dashed at an incredible speed.

Although the Stars Secret Skill has stopped, only his power of Stars ran out, his Spiritual Power was not affected. He still had plenty of battle strength. When he sped up, he could easily catch up with the Jin Kingdom Universe Masters.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang dashed and rushed. He appeared in front of the Jin Kingdom Universe Masters and casually attack them with swordsmanship or Soul Attack. None of the Universe Masters had resisted him, including the strongest Long Xu King and Red Snow King.

A slaughter!

But the slaughter only lasted for a short time. During that moment, among the more than 50 remaining Jin Kingdom Universe Masters, while only around ten of them escaped, others were reduced to nothing.

“The woman escaped.” Jian Wushuang stood in the Void, staring coldly in some direction. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The glamorous woman Jiu Xi who arranged the Enduring Samsara Formation escaped in that direction.

Jiu Xi possessed a remarkable life-saving ability. And she was smarter than other people. When she sensed something wrong, she immediately fled. Jian Wushuang did not chase her.

However, although she escaped from Jian Wushuang, she could not escape the battlefield because of the Formation in the Void around the battlefield.

“Although some Jin Kingdom soldiers escaped, these people can won’t come back. Anyway, this battle is over!” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly.

The Jin Kingdom monarch was killed!

A large number of Jin Kingdom experts were slaughtered. Only a dozen of Universe Masters fled.

Today was finally curtains for the battle.

“It’s over, this battle is finally over!”

“Our Green Fire World survived!”

“The Jin Kingdom was gone!”

The Green Fire World experts all exclaimed.

They won the war!

The Green Fire World won, and the Jin Kingdom was destroyed.

However, even if they won, the remaining Green Fire World experts could not rejoice over the victory.

There were no shouts of happiness, just bitter sighs.

They won the battle, but they still lost a lot!

Too many Green Fire World experts deceased!

They paid a too high price!

“Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, Palace Master Red Lotus…” Jian Wushuang repeated their names.

“And…”

Jian Wushuang looked up at a Void in the Battle Fortress. At the next moment, he dashed out and then appeared in the Battle Fortress.

In the Void above the Void, a figure stood there quietly, it was Xuan Yi.

“Master!” Jian Wushuang stopped in front of Xuan Yi.

“You came.” Xuan Yi turned his head and smiled. He still sounded gentle.

But Jian Wushuang saw that Xuan Yi aged overnight, and his aura became unstable.

When the oil ran out, the light went out. Xuan Yi’s oil had run out. He was having the last breaths of his life.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang quivered and clenched his hands.

“This is the Mountain River Map I borrowed from you, here you are.” Xuan Yi smiled and handed over the map in his hand.

When Jian Wushuang devised the three strongest Sword Principles and began to merge them, Xuan Yi had pulled the Enduring Samsara Formation Samsara into the Mountain River Map. He had completely repaired the Mountain River Map.
