Chapter 1343: The Ancient Star Sea

Jian Wushuang’s spaceship was flying fast in the dark heaven.

“I have revised the route to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. You can have a look.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang started to read the route.

“Two routes?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, one is going through the Ancient Star Sea, and the other is bypassing it.” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“What are the differences?”

“A lot. The Ancient Star Sea is a dangerous place in the Eternal Chaotic World. Though it is nothing for those almighty, it poses a big risk to Universe Gods.” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“In the Ancient Star Sea, there are not only natural crises, but also many Exotic Beasts that are hostile to human cultivators. They may hurt you.”

“Therefore, the first choice is full of risks of death, but it’s also time-efficient. It will take less than two thousand years to get there.”

“And the second choice is safer but it takes more time.”

“How much time does the second option take?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s hard to predict. Maybe thirty thousand years.” King of Venomous Worms answered.

“Thirty thousand years?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had cultivated for less than ten thousand years.

As he was unwilling to waste thirty thousand years on the journey, he chose to go through the Ancient Star Sea.

“I guessed you would choose the first one. I was right!” King of Venomous Worms smiled, “So, before getting to the Ancient Star Sea, you should try your best to improve your skills and power. The stronger you are, the more possibility you will have of surviving.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded. And he soon started to cultivate.

He had just left the Snow Sacred Land with his Spaceship, and it would take at least one hundred years for him to arrive at the margin of the Ancient Star Sea.

It was long enough for him.

“I have just created the advanced rank two unique skill. With the accumulation of swordsmanship, I could definitely create more powerful unique skills.” Jian Wushuang was confident.

“I will spend these one hundred years on improving my unique skills.”

Jian Wushuang was quite determined.

The journey in the dark heaven was boring, through which Jian Wushuang used all his time to cultivate.

And the one hundred and ten years passed soon.

“Jian Wushuang, you are now close to the Ancient Star Sea. Don’t get to the sea alone or you will die.” King of Venomous Worms said, “Go to the Land Six first.”

So Jian Wushuang followed the suggestion of King of Venomous Worms and drove his spaceship to a floating Land Six.

The Land Six was small. It was not a universe, but a station for human cultivators.

Jian Wushuang now stood on the Land Six.

Many geniuses from different Universes or Kingdoms came to the Land Six. They were all mighty talents.

And Jian Wushuang, as a Universe God, seemed trivial.

“Are they all coming for the Ancient Star Sea?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Of course. Some talents go there to cultivate, some go through the sea as a time-efficient way to go to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“They often team up to get through the Ancient Star Sea, which increases the possibility of success.”

“Team up?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

“There are many teams of cultivators who are going to the Ancient Star Sea. You can choose one and go to the sea with other Universe Gods. I think many teams would welcome you since you are a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven.” King of Venomous Worms suggested to Jian Wushuang.

“OK, I will have a try.”

Jian Wushuang started to find teams to get through the Ancient Star Sea.

Soon he received an invitation and joined a large team with around one hundred cultivators.

The cultivators in the team were at least Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

Three days later, at the margin of the heaven, a huge, ancient spaceship was ready to depart.

“Be prepared, guys. We are departing in an hour.”

The person who was talking was an elderly God with a green robe. His breath was full of power. Apparently, he was a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

Jian Wushuang was one member of the team. He knew that the elderly God was named Yu Shan, and that he was the leader of the team.

The team was made up of one hundred and forty cultivators.

Among them, there were three Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, twenty in the Second Heaven and the rest were all in the First Heaven. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

One hour passed. The ancient spaceship departed in the direction of the Ancient Star Sea.

Jian Wushuang sat at the deck of the spaceship, ignoring other talents nearby, some of whom were chatting and some were cultivating.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and found a boy.

The boy was around twelve years old. He was staring curiously at a bald man in front of him.
