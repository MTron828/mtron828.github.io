Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

With Jian Wushuang’s eager expectation, Emperor God Jiu Yin flipped his hand and took out a token in sword shape.

The token gave out an extremely unique aura. He could tell that it was some kind of token with one glance.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

He didn’t know anything about sword-shaped tokens.

Not only Jian Wushuang, but Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun reacted similarly.

Only Hall Master Yuan was surprised when he saw the token. After he took another careful look, he exclaimed, “This is Emperor Sword Palace’s Sword Principle Inheritance Token!”

“Emperor Sword Palace? Sword Principle Inheritance Token?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Your Excellency, you must be Hall Master Yuan from Lineage of Star,” Emperor God Jin Yin smiled at Hall Master Yuan. “Your Excellency has good eyesight. You recognized the token with one glance. You’re right. This token is Emperor Sword Palace’s Sword Principle Inheritance Token. As for its value, as Hall Master Yuan can recognize it, you should know.”

“Mm,” Hall Master Yuan nodded heavily.

He, of course, knew the price of the token.

“A huge present, it is really a huge present,” Hall Master Yuan complimented.

“Hall Master Yuan, what’s going on? What’s the origin of the Sword Principle Inheritance Token?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Hall Master Wushuang.”

As Emperor God Jiu Yin had yet to verify the death of the Master of Star Palace, Hall Master Yuan still referred to Jian Wushuang as Hall Master Wushuang instead of Palace Master in front of Emperor God Jiu Yin.

“You should have heard of Emperor Sword Sect, right?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Of course, I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “Emperor Sword Palace is one of the major forces in Sanctuary Alliance. They are extremely ancient and their foundation is strong. Although the power isn’t as fierce as Abysmal Palace and Soaring Heaven King Palace, their positions in Sanctuary Alliance is extraordinary.

“Hall Master Wushuang, you only know that Emperor Sword Sect is very old but you don’t know about its origins. Emperor Sword Sect is actually related to a super expert from the first era,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“First era?” Jian Wushuang stunned. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After ancient times, it had been the first era. After the first era collapsed, the second era derived from it, which had made Eternal Chaotic World.

Hall Master Yuan started explaining, “Among the three eras, ancient times were the strongest, followed by the first era. Ancient time is too long ago and the experts of Eternal Chaotic World could only find traces of ancient times from the ancient battlefield. However, the first era is considered rather close to us.”

“Although the first era couldn’t be compared to ancient times long ago, there were many top experts and geniuses, especially some super experts, who stood at the peak, their potential and talent are actually much higher than experts’ in ancient times. But due to the restriction of the environment during the first era, they couldn’t match evenly with experts in ancient times.”

“In this era, there were once many super experts. For example, the higher leader of ancient tribe, Ancient God Emperor, who was a ten-star Ancient God, his power was above Great Emperor.”

“Also Emperor White, he was from the first era as well. Back then, he was famous and highly positioned.”

“These two were considered true big figures back in the first era and they were considered super experts on the peak. However, their powers were merely in the top ten in the first era, not the top three.”

Jian Wushuang was convinced when he heard that.

Ancient God Emperor and Emperor Bai were powerful. Especially as Ancient God Emperor was the leader of Ancient God, a ten-star Ancient God. Actually, his power had already exceeded the range of Chaotic Realm but they couldn’t be listed in the top three in the first era.

How scary would the top three be?

“The top three in the first era, they were super experts who could truly break the sky and split heaven. Even if they were to be in ancient times, they were extremely talented figures. Ever since the first era collapsed, the top three and many experts in the first era died. Only Emperor Bai remained alive.”

“Among the three super experts, the one on the third place was Sword Emperor Dugu!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Sword Emperor Dugu?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

He didn’t know much about the first era. It was also his first time hearing Sword Emperor Dugu’s name.

However, judging from the name itself, Sword Emperor Dugu was definitely an expert who was good with a sword. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have the nickname of Sword Emperor.

“Sword Emperor Dugu had impressive swordsmanship. He was widely acknowledged as the first man in Sword Principle. It is said that although most of his Sword Principles were self-invented, his strongest and scariest Sword Principle was from ancient times.”

“When the first era collapsed, Sword Emperor Dugu died.”

“However, many years ago, when it came to the second era, Eternal Chaotic World started and there was a Sir God who happened to obtain Emperor Sword Palace that Sword Emperor Dugu left behind. Emperor Sword Palace contains Sword Principle and sword intention, and the Sir God happened to be good at sword too. He was the first who entered Emperor Sword Palace and he received the greatest opportunity and advantage.”

“After that, his power increased tremendously and he even broke through and reached Emperor God level. He used Emperor Sword Palace as his base and started Emperor Sword Sect! Then, Emperor Sword Sect started passing down until now,” Hall Master Yuan explained.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

He had heard of Emperor Sword Sect long ago but he had never expected Emperor Sword Sect to be related to Sword Emperor Dugu, who was powerful in the first era.

“Then, what’s this Sword Principle Inheritance Token?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sword Principle Inheritance Token is the token to enter Emperor Sword Palace. Although the greatest opportunities and advantages in Emperor Sword Palace were taken by the founder of Emperor Sword Sect, some of the opportunities couldn’t be taken away but could only be kept within Emperor Sword Palace. Emperor Sword Palace opens once every one million years and every time it opens, only those who hold Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens are qualified to enter.”

“Just like Emperor Sword Sect, although they control Emperor Sword Palace, their men can’t enter if they do not have Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens.”

Hall Master Yuan paused and continued, “There’s a total of five Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens. Under normal circumstances, Emperor Sword Sect would keep two for themselves and distribute the other three. In the end, the luckier sword experts would get them. They enter Emperor Sword Palace with the Sword Principle Inheritance Token and they could receive inheritance of Sword Principle, which was extremely helpful to their swordsmanship.”

“Plus, legend says that if one received sufficient opportunities and possessed talent, he would stand a chance to receive the terrifyingly powerful ancient Sword Principle that Sword Emperor Dugu controlled!!!”
