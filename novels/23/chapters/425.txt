Chapter 426: A Frightful Sword Move!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There was an invisible wave rippling around the black-robed emaciated lady. At the same time, Jian Wushuang approached her quietly.

“He is so fast!”?The emaciated lady was shocked.

“Humph.” Jian Wushuang snorted, then his Triple-kill Sword lunged in her direction.

Immediately she leaned to one side and narrowly dodged the sword. However, a sudden vast power gathered behind her, which was the long Blood River that turned into a giant hand, crashing onto her.

There was no more time for her to react after dodging the sword. Therefore, she was beaten back helter-skelter.

“It’s time.” A sharpness flashed in his eyes, Jian Wushuang suddenly moved.

“Danger!”

The green-clothed elder who had been suppressed by Jian Wushuang shouted and jumped in front of the emaciated lady, trying to hold off Jian Wushuang’s attack. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Seeing it, Jian Wushuang sneered and said, “You are asking for death!”

Jian Wushuang drew his sword.

With a straight lunge, the Triple-kill Sword turned into a bolt of lightning and rushed out,

Decisive and desperate!

It went towards the green-clothed elder directly.

The second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, Desperation!

Rumble~~~ The world was shaking as the sword light shot out.

“This...” the green-clothed elder couldn’t help narrowing his eyes.

Though the sword moves Jian Wushuang displayed before were powerful, when he fought with Jian Wushuang alone, he could fend off this attack if he tried his best. However, he felt helpless while facing the sword this time.

A strong sense of crisis rose and his whole body broke out with “gooseflesh”.

“Oh, no.”

Without hesitating, the green-clothed elder did his best to use his most powerful move. A pitch-black stick poked out.

The pitch-black stick and the long sword clashed.

Boom!

The blood vessels of the green-clothed elder’s hand burst, the Long Staff in that hand was flung away and his chest contained a big hole.

The sword shadow continued rushing towards the emaciated lady behind the green-clothed elder.

“How could this be possible?” The emaciated lady was in shock. But at this moment, she could only make a small move.

Boom!

The sword shadow hit her. Immediately her right body burst and her whole right hand was disintegrated.

A fierce pang of pain shot through her. She squeaked out shrill cries but at the next moment, she turned and fled, not daring to look at Jian Wushuang again.

“Run! Run! Run!”

The emaciated lady roared and she had lost her nerve to fight.

It was a sword of terror and intimidation.

On the battle field, experts of the two camps were in a fierce fight. When the sudden strong power broke out, they all looked at it, seeing the body of the green-clothed elder falling and the emaciated lady fleeing.

“What?”

“This is...”

Everyone was stunned.

Though they didn’t see how Jian Wushuang did it.

They were all in great shock.

Two Peak of Stage Three joined hands and fought with Jian Wushuang, but one died and the other fled.

How could this be?

They heard that, it was the Realm that Swordsman used which was strange, but his real strength was weak and hadn’t reached Peak of Stage Three yet, had he?

So how did he do it?

Realizing what had happened, their faces changed.

On the one hand, Bone King, Xue Yang, Beast and the others who were in the same camp with Jian Wushuang were all amazed and happy.

On the other hand, experts of Pale Moon Marquis camp were sullen.

“What the hell is going on?”

“He is much stronger than we thought. He could make us lose two Peak of Stage Three with one blow.”

“That terrible Realm has been so troublesome. How could his strength be so strong?”

Duo Xin Marquis’s face was grim. He shot a look at Jian Wushuang and cursed in mind,?“Damn it, Master Deng Huo, where are you? Why don’t you show up!”

Duo Xin Marquis didn’t attach any extravagant hope that they could do anything to Jian Wushuang.

They had an advantage at first for having nine experts. But now, one of them was killed, one had lost her battle strength. The number of their experts was the same as the opposite side. Looking at their rivals, Jian Wushuang’s Realm and his terrible strength, they could easily be suppressed.

The situation had been reversed.

“Haha, we will win!”

Bone King, Beast and the others laughed, even cool Xue Yang smiled.

They all saw the hope of winning.

But right at this moment...

Dung!

A muffled sound rose from the far horizon.

The weak sound was getting louder at an astonishing speed, beating like battle drums in their hearts and all people on the battle field stopped.

They all looked at where the sound came from.

They saw a “sun”.

The “sun” was dazzling like the sun and moon.

Seeing the “sun”, Duo Xin Marquis relieved sighed, “Finally he has arrived!”

All other experts of Pale Moon Marquis camp were happy while seeing the “sun” coming. They knew who he was.

“This is?”

Bone King also gazed at the far dazzling “sun”. Realizing who he might be, his face changed instantly.

The muffled footsteps were still on and the “sun” approached. Then, a white-robed figure walked out of the light.

It was a white-robed and barefooted elder, who was gentle and mild like sunlight.

Recognizing the white-robed elder, Bone King narrowed his eyes.

“Deng Huo!”
