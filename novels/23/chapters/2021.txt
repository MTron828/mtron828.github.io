2022 Put On A Full Show

Lin Tianhao smacked his red palm a few times.

He could control his divine power so that the power wouldn’t spread but the power that the mighty power that the palm brought about was terrifying.

Jian Wushuang felt as though he was a volcano exploding continuously.

“Haha, interesting.”

Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter as his hands were covered with a layer of redness. The very next moment, there was an unprecedented rage that spread from Jian Wushuang’s body.

“King of Beast’s Divine Punch, first move!”

Roar!

There was a faint roar and a shadow of a ferocious beast appeared behind Jian Wushuang out of nowhere. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

His punch brought about the power of a thunderbolt and hit.

As he wanted to pretend to be a barbaric, valiant man who was good with his fists, Jian Wushuang had naturally intentionally studied some punch skills intensively.

He had been wandering in Eternal Chaotic World for so many years and he received various secret skills. Among them, there were many punch skills. Jian Wushuang found one that was not too shabby and suitable for his barbaric character, which was King of Beast’s Divine Punch.

There were twenty-seven moves in the punching skill.

“Second move!”

“Third move!”

A punch followed by another. He continuously punched and he intentionally controlled the divine power contained in every single punch. However, he still managed to pierce the spacetime with ease.

Jian Wushuang’s barbaric punches collided with Lin Tianhao’s volcanic palms. In an instant… Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The low thud resounded in everyone’s ears. Under such strong attacks, both intentionally controlled their divine powers but still caused quite a significant movement.

Both of them exchanged blows in an instant, in one breath time.

“Stop!”

There was a loud roar from outside the bar.

Jian Wushuang and Lin Tianhao immediately stopped.

Swoosh!

There was a figure that appeared in the bar in a flash. The figure appeared right in between Jian Wushuang and Lin Tianhao.

He was a white-haired elder who went through the transformation of the world. His long, white beard reached above his chest and there was rage in his murky eyes.

“The two of you have guts. How dare you fight so ferociously in Imperial City?” The elder was angry and his boundless divine might spread. His divine might already reach the level of a Peak Emperor God, also the top of middle stage Chaotic Realm.

Looking at the arrival of the elder, Jian Wushuang remained casual in manner but he was actually shocked.

“Lin Tianhao and I fought for less than a breath of time. On top of that, we could control our divine power for the movement to be even smaller. But in such a short period of time, there was a Peak Emperor God that rushed here. Plus, I also felt a faint soul power sweep over earlier. I believe there is a Great Emperor who noticed the situation here.”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He was astonished at how strict the guard in Imperial City was.

The reason why he had intentionally provoked Lin Tianhao and fought with him was that he wanted to test the actual situation in Imperial City.

But the result was far beyond his expectations.

The guard in Imperial City itself is so strict. As the core of Imperial City, Imperial Peak where Imperial Cabinet was located, how much stricter could it be?

Under such high alert, wouldn’t he be noticed as soon as Jian Wushuang did anything?

In the bar, many customers stood up simultaneously out of curiosity.

In the middle of the bar, the elder was raging with anger.

Jian Wushuang said casually, “It has nothing to do with me. This b*stard started it. I can’t just stand here and let him hit me.”

The elder squinted his eyes and fixed his gaze on the waiter in black.

The waiter in black had been standing to the side earlier. He watched the cause of the ferocious fight very clearly. He immediately replied, “Mister Deacon, it is true that this mister took action first.”

The elder then cast a reprimanding gaze at Lin Tianhao.

Lin Tianhao took a deep breath and bowed at the elder politely. He then said, “Mister Deacon, I am Lin Tianhao, from Lin Family in Prefecture Tong.

“From Lin Family?” The elder’s face changed.

In Three-Emperors World, there were many strong forces and families, especially families.

Some ancient families were powerful and influential within Imperial Cabinet. For instance, Lin Family was one of them.

Although Lin Family didn’t have any Peak Chaotic Realm leader, they had more than four experts in Peak middle stage Chaotic Realm. Three out of four of them were holding important posts in the Imperial Cabinet. Some might hold an even higher position than he did.

“Humph, even if you are a disciple from Lin Family, you do not behave like a rascal in Imperial City,” the elder humphed coldly. But it was obvious that his tone was much calmer.

“Yes, I’ll remember that,” Lin Tianhao nodded continuously.

“Alright. If both parties are fine, this ends here. Dismiss yourselves,” the elder waved and then left.

The bar became quiet again.

Only Jian Wushuang and Lin Tianhao were left standing there.

“Ah Shou, right? I remember you! You’re lucky this time. You wouldn’t be that lucky next time. Aren’t you joining the ranking competition in five years’ time? I happen to be joining that too. By then, I won’t let you off the hook,” Lin Tianhao said coldly.

“Haha. Come on. I’ll be ready to fight with you,” Jian Wushuang scoffed. Then, he grabbed the waiter in black next to him, “You, take me to somewhere to stay.”

“Yes, yes,” the waiter in black naturally followed his command.

In no time, Jian Wushuang came to a secret room under the lead of the waiter in black. Although the surroundings of the room were covered in a layer of prohibition and ordinary people wouldn’t just come in as they wish. Jian Wushuang wouldn’t let the three of them out just in case.

“Jian Wushuang, aren’t you asking for too much attention in Imperial City?” Abysmal Saint Master creased his eyebrows and said.

The three of them saw what had happened earlier.

Jian Wushuang did catch a lot of attention as he was too barbaric.

However, Jian Wushuang laughed at the comment, “As I am acting, I have to put on a full show. On top of that, the experts in Three-Emperors World know that we barged in, they will definitely be on high alert. Especially in Imperial City, they will definitely keep watch of every new expert.”

“I am an expert in early stage chaotic realm who came to Imperial City. I reckon there will be someone already watching me the moment I enter the city. If I were to be extra careful in Imperial City, the experts in Imperial Cabinet would pay more attention or even be suspicious of me. Now that I behaved barbarically, the experts in Imperial Cabinet won’t be that suspicious of me instead.”
