Chapter 2927: Inkstone Realm

——

The primordial divine realm was vast and boundless.

Not to mention the three heavens in the center, the endless territories beyond the three heavens were countless, and the territories they occupied were beyond imagination.

After Jian Wushuang left the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, he used the space passage to pass through one territory after another. Thus, he passed through nearly 100 times on the way.

It must be known that the cost of traveling from one territory to another territory was not small. On the contrary, the cost of traveling from one territory to another territory, which was separated by several or even more than 10 territories, was even greater, after traveling nearly 100 times, the cost that Jian Wushuang had to pay was no less than hundreds of thousands of saint elixirs. It was comparable to the entire wealth of an ordinary Immortal Saint.

Jian Wushuang had teleported almost a hundred times so that he could be further away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, and the three experts of the Saint Realm could not find him. As a result, Jian Wushuang did not know which territory he was in and how far from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

“Let’s ask someone first.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and rushed forward.

…

In the vast sky, dark clouds covered the earth. Lightning snakes flickered in the dark clouds from time to time as if dragons were rolling in them.

This was a barren plain, where a battle was going on.

This battle was a massacre.

A group of bandits suddenly targeted a team of experts with more than ten people. More than a hundred experts surrounded and killed them crazily.

Among the group of over ten experts, the strongest ones were only two Peak Divine Masters. But, faced with the encirclement of over a hundred experts, they were quickly defeated.

Those bandits were also crazily chasing after these two people.

“Damn it. This isn’t a place where bandits run rampant. So how did this group of bandits come here?” A middle-aged man who wore a triangular helmet and was as strong as an ox roared as he fled.

“What bandits? This is a trap deliberately set up by someone to deal with us. If nothing goes wrong, it should be someone from our clan. If someone didn’t inform us, how would these people know our whereabouts?” The purple-haired older man shouted in a deep voice.

“Clan members, could it be…” The strong middle-aged man was shocked.

“Hmph, other than that good brother of yours, who else would use that great formation to deal with us?” The violet-haired older man shouted.

The muscular middle-aged man’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

“Let’s flee. Let’s see if we can escape with our luck.” The violet-haired older man sighed softly.

Behind him, over a hundred experts were chasing closely, each of them brimming with killing intent.

But right at this moment…

Weng!

A figure suddenly appeared in the air. The moment this figure appeared, a terrifying pressure came hurling down.

The robust middle-aged man and the purple-haired older man immediately squatted in the air. The hundreds of experts chasing behind them also stopped.

Everyone raised their heads in shock, looking at the young figure like a god in the air.

“This pressure is too strong. It’s much stronger than father was when he was alive. It’s countless times stronger!”

“Father was a high-level Great Divine Master when he was alive, but compared to this person, he’s like an ant. This person is very likely an Immortal Saint-level super expert. But, even if he’s not, he’s still the legendary unrivaled Great Divine Master” The robust middle-aged man was shocked.

“This is our chance.” The purple-haired Elder was pleasantly surprised. He immediately bowed and said, “Greetings, sir. What can I do for you?”

“I want to ask you something. I hope you can answer me.” Jian Wushuang looked down with a cold expression.

“Please ask, sir.” The purple-haired Elder was very respectful. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Which realm is this?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sir, this is the Inkstone Realm,” the purple-haired Elder said. But, at the same time, he immediately understood that the person in front of him should be an expert who had just arrived from the outside world.

“Inkstone Realm?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

When he was free in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, he also saw the Star Fields’ map in the surrounding territories. The map was quite vast, but it did not mention the Inkstone Realm.

Obviously, his current location was very far away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

“Let me ask you again, who are the Realm Masters of your Inkstone Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“My lord, there are four Realm Masters in the Inkstone Realm, and each of them is a powerful Immortal Saint. I wonder who you are asking about?” The purple-haired Elder asked.

“Four Realm Masters?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Usually, there was only one Realm Master in a realm, but there were four in the Inkstone Realm.

Jian Wushuang knew that the four Realm Masters would fight for their own interests.

“Which of the four Realm Masters is the closest to here?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I know. It’s the Evergreen Realm Master. He lives in Evergreen Island, which is less than ten days away,” the purple-haired Elder said.

“Give me the map of the Star Field.” Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand.

The purple-haired Elder did not hesitate and immediately handed the most comprehensive map of the Star Field to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it and immediately knew the location of the Evergreen Realm Master. He nodded and then looked at the hundreds of experts who had been chasing after the purple-haired Elder and the middle-aged man. “This deal ends here. You… can leave.”

The hundreds of experts who were chasing after the purple-haired Elder and the burly middle-aged man were extremely unwilling.

However, after looking at Jian Wushuang, the leader of the hundreds of experts chose to endure.

“Let’s go!”

The hundreds of experts immediately turned and left.

Jian Wushuang’s figure also disappeared.

As for the purple-haired Elder and the strong middle-aged man, they were overjoyed.

Without any hesitation, they immediately set off and fled as fast as they could.

…

Evergreen Island, the residence of the Evergreen Realm Lord.

The Inkstone Realm was extremely vast, three to four times larger than an ordinary realm. Naturally, more experts were born.

However, after a round of fighting, these experts gradually turned into four forces. Each of the four forces had a ruler, which was the four Realm Masters of the Inkstone realm.

Among the four Realm Masters, Evergreen Realm Master was just an ordinary one. He was not strong, only at the level of an Immortal Saint. He was far from being a True Saint.

Jian Wushuang had already arrived at Evergreen Island.
