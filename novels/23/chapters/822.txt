Chapter 823: Fight with Six Steps of the Eternal Realm Experts!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Gold-armored Ancient God Jian Wushuang transformed held the Blood Mountain Sword, his overbearing aura making him look like the lord of the world.

The guards flinched in surprise by Jian Wushuang’s aura, but continued rushing him.

They never met any Divine Realm expert with an aura as domineering this one.

However, as experts in Six Steps of the Eternal Realm, they were unaffected by it.

“Go to hell!”

“Die!”

The guards yelled one after the other, and attacked Jian Wushuang from the left and right simultaneously.

One of them held a long gold spear, and as the spear shined like a dragon dashing out to sea, air-piercing, frightening sounds echoed.

The other one brandished a long black whip, which looked more like a black snake. It lashed at Jian Wushuang’s throat in a strange way as if it to garrotte him.

Neither guard restrained their power.

Their moves fully demonstrated their strength. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Seeing the moves, Jian Wushuang was not fearful, but excited.

The next second, a red cloud floated out of his sword as he leaped.

Bam!

The Void suffered a sudden shake. Jian Wushuang’s sword stabbed straight to meet the spear and whip.

“How could a Divine Realm expert not retreat when facing the attacks of two Six Steps of the Eternal Realm experts?”

“You want to fight blow-for-blow?”

“How dare you!”

“You court death!”

Seeing Jian Wushang’s move, the guards strengthened their attacks.

Clang! Thwack!

Two dull, crashing sounds vibrated and echoed through the air. Jian Wushuang stepped back and leaped forward again.

His sword struck twice.

Two sword lights flashed away at once.

The strikes appeared simple, but were subtly exquisite.

So much so, the two guards could not help hiding the impressed wide eyes.

“This body blocked our attacks?”

“Yeah, and more than that, he fought back so quickly.”

The two guards wore surprised looks on their faces while talking. They effortlessly warded off Jian Wushuang’s exquisite blows, however, Jian Wushuang charged at them again.

In a split second, they closed the distance and resumed fighting.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The continuous crashing sounds deafened everything throughout their death match, and seemingly exchanged a hundred blows.

Yet, no sign showed that Jian Wushuang was overpowered.

“How could it be possible?”?Xia Yan thought, watching with an agape jaw.

The two guards must have felt the same.

“He produced a close battle against us!”

“Make no mistake. This boy is in the Six Steps as well!” One of the guards shouted.

“He restrained his power on the Blood Battle Arena last time!” The other guard echoed with a grave expression.

“There is something wrong with my spear!”

The spear guard glanced down at his weapon in shock. “There is a damage to my spear. His sword is peculiar!”

“So was my whip.”

The two guards gazed at Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, yet confidently.

The sword in his hand was crafted by his master, Xuan Yi, and possessed incredible might.

In terms of battle strength, Jian Wushuang was in the Five Steps, however, with the power of the Blood Mountain Sword, he exerted the power of a Six Steps expert. Apart from that, he was proficient at close combat and fighting out a besiege. Therefore, even under the two Six Steps experts’ fury, he stood his ground.

Most of all, the Blood Mountain Sword’s toughness and sharp edge broke off Lei Xin’s magic weapon with five strikes.

The two guards’ weapons were at the same level as the magic weapon, and though Jian Wushuang was less powerful than the two guards, he had only managed to cause a slight crack on the guards’ weapons after a hundred blows.

If the two guards were in Five Steps, he would have broken their weapons long ago.

“This boy is really unusual. Let’s end this fight quickly,” the spear guard said to his companion icily.

The next moment, his aura surged, and his body expanded in width, his muscles bulged and his silver clothes ripped.

In an instant, he looked like a feral beast.

The same thing happened to the other guard.

They appeared far more powerful than before.

“Are they displaying a Secret Skill?”?Jian Wushuang thought, snickering out loud.

Although he knew he was correct. “They must have displayed a Secret Skill to reform their bodies and increase their power.”

“Howl!”

One of the guards roared, and immediately dived at Jian Wushuang again.

Seeing that the guards move faster than before, Jian Wushuang pointed his sword defensively.

“It has been difficult for me to battle them before they used this secret skill, now, it will prove even more difficult. I am no longer their match.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and gulped. The next second, he waved his hand and a flowing light flashed through the air.

The light turned into a strong-built Puppet Fighter in the blink of an eye. Faceless, the puppet rushed the two guards.

At the same time, about a million Divine Gems were consumed inside the Interspatial Ring on his right index finger as he clenched his right hand, punching the guards with that power.

An earth-shattering blow with the power of the superior Six Steps behind it.

The two guards were the targets.

The two remained calm staring down the blow. They could tell it was powerful, but were unafraid. They swung their weapons at the puppets in unison.

Boom!!

A thunderclap echoed all around.

Where the sound came from, the void cracked like a glass window.
