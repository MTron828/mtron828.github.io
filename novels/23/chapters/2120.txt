Chapter 2121 Crumbling

“Roar!”

The black beast made a deafening roar.

At that instant, the Abysmal Saint Master erupted. He went all-out.

The leader of the group, the Demon King Chen Yu, looked at the beast in disdain.

“Scram!”

Demon King Chen Yu yelled as he took a step forward. His fist, surrounded by a thick demonic mist, punched out.

A terrifying aura swept out.

Boom!

A thunderous sound reverberated as the dark beast the size of a small mountain exploded under the impact of the punch.

At the same time, the dark vortex the Abysmal Saint Master was in started to crumble with a bang.

Whoosh!

The Abysmal Saint Master retreated and barely managed to balance himself once again.

He was pale and there was blood at the corner of his mouth.

“The difference between stage two and stage three is so big?” The Abysmal Saint Master looked at Demon King Chen Yu in shock.

He managed to break through to become a stage two emperor not long after he had left the Three Emperor World. He was slightly stronger than the Red Dragon King.

Even so, he was helpless against the Demon King Chen Yu, who was in stage three.

“Mayday, mayday!”

“Heaven Repairing Palace is under attack. Acheron Palace has a stage three great emperor. East Royal Emperor and I are no match for him. Requesting help immediately!”

The Abysmal Saint Master sent out a distress message.

He knew that even if he asked for reinforcements now, the experts from Sanctuary Alliance and the Special Tribes Alliance would need time to get there. During this period of time, could he and East Royal Emperor fend off the attackers?

The answer was no.

“Humph. I will not waste time on trash like you.” Demon King Chen Yu looked Abysmal Saint Master in the eye as he moved towards the Heaven Repairing Palace.

“Stop!!” The Abysmal Saint Master yelled fiercely as the darkness shrouded him in an attempt to stop the Demon King in his tracks.

Before he could get to the Demon King, he was stopped by three other great emperors.

None of the three great emperors reached stage two, but they could hinder his movements when they worked together.

On the other side, the East Royal Emperor was in the same predicament as the Abysmal Saint Master: he was surrounded by three great emperors.

“Damn it!!!”

The Abysmal Saint Master and East Royal Emperor did not look good.

On the other hand, the Demon King Chen Yu appeared in front of the Heaven Repairing Palace.

“Is this the Heaven Repairing Palace? According to legend, the palace was built at a great cost by a clan. It was a top-tier opportunity even back in the ancient past. It is a pity that such a place is now used by a group of people in the Chaotic Realm trying to breakthrough. What a joke.”

“I shall completely destroy it.” Demon King Chen Yu smiled coldly.

He clenched his fist and punched outwards.

Boom!

It was a powerful punch,

So powerful that everything between his fist and the palace exploded.

A deafening sound was heard. The entire palace trembled and returned to normal after a while.

“Oh? It seems to be quite sturdy? That’s right, this palace managed to survive that apocalyptic war, of course it should be sturdy.” Demon King Chen Yu was surprised, then he understood why.

“Since that is the case…”

A flash of ruthlessness flashed across his eyes before his aura rose to the peak. He was surrounded by demonic mist before he attacked once again.

This time, the Demon King Chen Yu used both his hands.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Punches with the power to kill an ordinary great emperor rained down on the palace. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Under the frenzied assault, the palace started to tremble more and more. It threatened to collapse at any time.

Within the Heaven Repairing Palace, in the dark space…

Jian Wushuang sat quietly, meditating to the various doctrines and cultivating the second scroll of the Immemorial Celestial Body.

After half a month of meditation, his understanding of the Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine improved significantly. Both his Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine reached the ninth level within the Doctrine Palace, with the Spacetime Doctrine only one step away from turning into Rules of Order.

As for his Sword Doctrine, his understanding had improved greatly. If he were to cast his sword principles such as Sword Principle Xuan Luo, it would be much more powerful and brilliant.

As for the second scroll of Immemorial Celestial Body… This secret skill was of a very high level. If Jian Wushuang were in the outside world, he would need a long time to successfully cultivate it. Now on the altar, with the help of the pure energy, his progress was fast. He was not far from success. He estimated he would need roughly ten more days before he successfully cultivate the second scroll. If that was the case, his fighting power would skyrocket once again.

He left after half a month inside the Heaven Repairing Palace. Under normal circumstances, he would have made it in time.

Right then…

Boom!

A thunderous boom exploded in his eardrums.

A crack in space appeared in the dark space in which the twelve altars were located.

That was just the beginning. Soon after, the booms started to become more regular. A large amount of space was destroyed as the twelve altars threatened to collapse at any time.

“What is going on?”

“What is happening?”

“Looks like someone is attacking the Heaven Repairing Palace from outside. Abysmal Saint Master and East Royal Emperor should be guarding the palace. Who dares to create this commotion?”

The twelve emperor gods were surprised as the received a message from the Abysmal Saint Master.

“Seven great emperors from Acheron Palace attacked?”

As far as he knew, Sanctuary Alliance paid utmost attention to the opening of Heaven Repairing Palace this time. There were two great emperors guarding the palace personally. At the various entrances, there were secret restrictions and many almighties standing on guard, and yet the Acheron Palace managed to break through all these defences?
