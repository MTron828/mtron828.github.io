4378 The Attack of a Strong Enemy

Creation!

What a grand and terrifying word.

Even Jian Wushuang’s heart couldn’t help but beat wildly when he thought of this.

After a long time.

“You’re thinking too far ahead. For me, breaking through to the refined state is the most important thing.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered. After taking a deep breath, he put away the Wuxu chaotic cauldron.

The battle on the Ancient Path of Stars should have ended by now, which meant that the feast of all races in the universe was about to begin.

Other than breaking through to the Supreme-being realm, his strength could no longer advance any further. The only thing he could do now was to wait quietly for the Great Clan Gathering to begin.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang sat on the peak of the mountain and let the strong wind blow across his face. He slowly closed his eyes.

Time passed day by day. Just as the universe banquet was about to begin, Jian Wushuang felt the jade pendant that ‘Lady Blue’ had given him and his heart throbbed.

Boom!

All of a sudden, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard from afar.

“Jian Wushuang!”

With a cold shout, a lightning bolt shot over at an extreme speed!

In the beginning, he was still at the edge of the universe, but he was just a small black dot. The next moment, the small black dot suddenly enlarged in Jian Wushuang’s pupils and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang!

The lightning dissipated and turned into a black-robed man who covered his entire face, only revealing a pair of Scarlet eyes.

“Who are you?”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked at him.

“You don’t need to know who I am.”

The black-robed man’s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were scarlet.

“You only need to know that I am here on the orders of the King of Day to take your life!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black-robed man flipped his right hand, and a pitch-black Trident appeared in his hand.

He had no intention of talking to Jian Wushuang. His supreme divine power surged and he threw the trident at Jian Wushuang’s head!

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank slightly. He quickly rose into the sky and dodged the attack.

Bang!

The trident hit the towering mountain where Jian Wushuang was sitting with his legs crossed. In an instant, the entire mountain collapsed with a loud bang, raising a cloud of dust.

“Sundering stars!”

A cold voice was heard. Then, a sharp blue sword rainbow slashed out from the dust and sand. It broke through the void and came.

“Small tricks.”

The black-robed man didn’t care about the star slashing sword rainbow at all. He casually grabbed with his right hand and instantly shattered the sharp sword rainbow.

“Jian Wushuang, just use your Tarot Divine Sword and chaotic cauldron.”

“Let’s go!” He said lightly. Immediately, a peak Supreme martial artist cultivation suddenly surged out. It was as if a bomb had been thrown into a calm lake. The entire starry sky boiled as if it could not withstand this huge force and countless cracks appeared.

“A top Supreme-being!”

Jian Wushuang’s body trembled and his heart sank.

He had guessed that the six major forces would not let him go, but he had not expected that the six major forces would think so highly of him and send a top-tier Ruler to kill him, an Ultimate Ruler.

One had to know, what kind of figures were the top Supreme martial artists?

Top Supreme-beings were all famous figures in the universe. They were powerful enough to establish a Holy Kingdom and become an ancient Overlord!

“Then I’ll do as you wish!”

Although Jian Wushuang was afraid, there was no fear in his eyes. He took out the Wuxu chaotic cauldron with his right hand.

“Go!”

He shouted in a low voice and in an instant, the black primordial chaos power was drawn out by Jian Wushuang. Like the heavy water of the sky River, he held it in his hand and slapped it at the black-robed man.

“Is this the power of the Wuxu chaotic cauldron?”

The black-robed man’s eyes gleamed as he pushed forward with both hands, supremely divine power surging out of his hands and colliding with the primal Chaos energy!

In an instant, the two unparalleled forces collided, and a series of explosions rang out in the sky. The entire starry sky began to collapse under the impact of these two forces, turning into nothingness!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sleeves of the black-robed man’s arms burst open, revealing his lean arms.

However, he did not retreat even half a step.

“Tsk tsk, that’s all you got.”

The next moment, he let out a low and sinister laugh and quickly cast a divine spell, ruthlessly tearing it in two directions.

A shocking scene occurred. The chaotic force that seemed to be able to sweep up the heavy water of the heavenly River was actually torn apart by the black-robed man!

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s face turned extremely gloomy.

It seemed that the attack power of the Wuxu chaotic cauldron was limited to killing an advanced Supreme-being. To top Supreme-beings, it would cause some trouble, but it would not be fatal!

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered. He stepped back with his right foot and quickly retreated!

...

It was obviously not wise to fight this top-tier Supreme Being head-on. It was better to avoid him for the time being and wait until the Grand Assembly of all races in the universe started!

He had a hunch that the Great Clan Gathering would begin in the next few days!

“You want to escape?”

The black-robed man sneered disdainfully. His body shuttled back and forth, once again turning into a bolt of lightning and chasing after Jian Wushuang.

The two of them quickly disappeared under the starry sky.

Not long after the two of them left, a few more streaks of light arrived.

“Did you just leave?”

Supreme Bing Ye stepped in the void and his silver eyes turned slightly. A thoughtful look flashed in his eyes. Then, he performed greater teleportation and flew toward Jian Wushuang and the black-robed man at a speed that far exceeded their own.

His body flickered like a dot of light. Every time he flickered, he would travel a million miles, directly from one star region to another.

Just like Supreme Bing Ye, Scarlet Sun Demon Master, the Blood Sky Hall Master, and Supreme Qing Gou from Cosmos Temple all performed their divine skills to chase after Jian Wushuang after they arrived at the star area that Jian Wushuang had left behind!

In the distance, a six-clawed Divine Dragon that was a hundred thousand feet long was shuttling through the clouds and the Galaxy. It was devouring the sun and moon as it swam in the sky.

...

There was no emotion in his golden eyes.

He was the one sent by the dragon clan to kill Jian Wushuang. He was the leader of the fourth generation of the dragon clan, Long Qing!

…

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Bang bang bang!”

The black-robed man sent by the Great Sun Divine Kingdom followed Jian Wushuang at a moderate pace. Like a cat toying with a mouse, he kept swinging his trident at Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang continued to use his chaotic force to block the black-robed man’s attacks.

Fortunately, the power of the five elements in the cauldron was endless. Otherwise, a casual attack from the black-robed man would cause him immeasurable damage!

The difference in power between an Ultimate Ruler and a Supreme Ruler was simply too great.

The chasm between the two was like a heavenly chasm.

“If it was just him, I’m confident I could defeat him or escape, but…”

Jian Wushuang felt that there were several auras that were not weaker than the black-robed man’s, and they were even more powerful. They were rapidly pulling away from him!
