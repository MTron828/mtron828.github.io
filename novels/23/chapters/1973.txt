To make Green Fire World into another cultivation sanctuary far beyond Thunderbolt Island?

Jian Wushuang believed that Green Fire World absolutely had the potential. It might be even better.

However, to create cultivation sanctuary, it would require all cultivators in Green Fire World to relocate...

Firstly, these cultivators were nurtured in Green Fire World to begin with and it was their hometown. Why would they need to be relocated?

Who would be willing to leave their home?

Besides, Green Fire World was a big world. It contained many ancient worlds in different sizes. In accumulation, how many cultivators would there be?

With so many cultivators, even if they really relocated, just how difficult would it be?

During the process of relocation, it was inevitable that a large number of cultivators or innocent people would die. The people had been plunged into an abyss of misery anyway!

The condition that Yan Zun proposed was considered generous in Sanctuary Alliance. If it wasn’t for Jian Wushuang, they would have conquered Green Fire World by force with thunderous measures. As for cultivators in Green Fire World, Sanctuary Alliance would at most leave those who were stronger and more talented. The remaining, including countless living spirits in ancient worlds, would be wiped out straightaway.

That was Sanctuary Alliance’s cruelty.

To Sanctuary Alliance, they only cared about the safety of the entire Eternal Chaotic World. As for cultivators in the big world, they wouldn’t care.

Sanctuary Alliance didn’t care but Jian Wushuang couldn’t not care, because Green Fire World was his hometown.

“How about the special tribes?” Jian Wushuang looked at the experts who were from special tribes.

“Sanctuary Alliance want to make Green Fire World into a brand new sanctuary, we naturally won’t stop them. However, if Green Fire World were to be that magical, the few of our special tribes would only need Sanctuary Alliance to agree to segregate a territory for us to cultivate,” the Great Emperor from Sky-devouring clan spoke.

Sanctuary Alliance and the special tribe had always been keeping a mutual position. Plus, there were times where if it concerned the safety of Eternal Chaotic World, both parties would work together. Hence, there wasn’t any hatred nor resentment. Just like Green Fire World, a special place, as the special tribes listed their conditions, Sanctuary Alliance would mostly agree.

“It seemed that the cultivators in Green Fire World are destined to be relocated?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be stubborn. With you alone, you won’t be able to keep Green Fire World,” Yan Xun advised.

“Jian Wushuang, do you still want to be stubborn about this?” Abysmal Saint Master smiled coldly. He was dying for Jian Wushuang to persist. Then, all experts from various forces would be raging with anger, especially the special tribe that was hot-tempered. It’d be best if they were to kill Jian Wushuang straightaway.

“Sword Emperor, hand over Green Fire World. Considering the fact that you carry the bloodline of Ancient God, I guarantee that if you were to be willing to hand out Green Fire World, they absolutely won’t have the guts to do anything to the cultivators in Green Fire World,” the nine-star Ancient God who lead the Ancient God spoke loud and clear.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but look at the nine-star Ancient God.

He had heard long ago that there was a nine-star Ancient God in Ancient God tribe but it was his first time seeing one.

“I wonder how I should address you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I am King Luo Yu!” The nine-star Ancient God replied.

“King Luo Yu? The Luo family?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “I once received the blood essence inheritance of an eight-star Ancient God, King Luo Zhen. He should be related to you, right?”

“King Luo Zhen?” Your Ancient God bloodline is from King Luo Zhen?” King Luo Yu’s face changed.

“King Luo Yu, I once visited Ancient God Sanctuary and I know of an Ancient God too. From what I know, Ancient God tribe has an iron discipline whereby bloodline is of paramount importance. Regardless of their strength, as long as their bloodline is stronger than yours, you have to be respectful and you even have to listen to their command. I wonder if that’s true,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It is,” King Luo Yu nodded, “Ancient God tribe is a tribe that honors the bloodline. We believed in Ancient God Emperor from the first era. Over the years, this has never changed.”

“If so...” there was a strange light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then... vroom!!!

There was a boundless bloodline power that exploded from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The bloodline power was extremely intense and vast. It was also very powerful!

Jian Wushuang naturally let his ancient tribe bloodline power to flow out then.

Ancient tribe was one of the four God tribes back in ancient times. It was a complete version of Ancient God.

Ancient God was merely a faint bloodline that was segregated from ancient tribe.

In terms of purity of the bloodline, ancient tribe bloodline was naturally above Ancient God.

Then, as Jian Wushuang displayed his bloodline power, the experts from various forces didn’t care but only thought that Jian Wushuang’s bloodline power was ferocious.

However, the Ancient Gods at the scene.

For instance, King Gu Tong and King Gu You, and even nine-star Ancient God King Luo Yu, were instantly dumbfounded.

“This, this bloodline...”

“Royal, royal bloodline!!!”

“It wouldn’t be mistaken. A bloodline aura that was sufficient for me to yield to. It is absolutely royal bloodline. It might even be purer than royal bloodline. How is this possible?”

The experts from Ancient God tribe looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

They had known long ago that Jian Wushuang carried Ancient God bloodline and it was Royal Ancient God.

However, they had never expected that Jian Wushuang’s bloodline would have heightened again and reached a brand new level.

“King Luo Yu, do you remember what you said earlier?” Jian Wushuang looked at King Luo Yu coldly.

The expression on King Luo Yu’s face was complicated. After he struggled for a bit emotionally, he let out a long sigh.

King Luo Yu lifted his head again and the look he gave to Jian Wushuang had a tinge of reverence, “Sword Emperor, although I have no idea how you obtained the bloodline, no doubt, the purity of your bloodline is above mine. There is no one in Ancient God tribe that could compared to it favorably. In history, Ancient God tribe has always honored bloodline above all. If you are willing to, you can head back to Ancient God Sanctuary with me and I will gather all masters of nine cities to discuss taking you as out new Ancient God Emperor. I believe no one would dare to suspect.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised by his reply.

The surrounding experts from various forces burst into an uproar.

Although they had known since long ago that Ancient God honored bloodline the most, King Luo Yu was a Great Emperor. His power was far stronger than Jian Wushuang’s and he should be on the top among Ancient God tribe. At such a crucial moment, he could totally ignore it if he were to meet anyone who had a higher bloodline than him.

However, they never expected that King Luo Yu would immediately show his willingness to take Jian Wushuang as the new Ancient God Emperor.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
