In a brief moment, Jian Wushuang was utterly astonished.

Just one sword stroke had led to the ancient Qiuhuang City’s downfall. The formidable master of the Sword Dao didn’t spare a glance at the destruction he caused, simply leaving. Jian Wushuang wasn’t particularly interested in the reasons behind it; what captured his attention was that single stroke of the sword.

The illusionary long sword had only manifested once before it began to disperse. Jian Wushuang absorbed the potent Sword Dao origin source from it. A significant portion of this power merged into his Ultimate Sword Dao, while the rest, he couldn’t absorb entirely. If he could absorb most of it, that would be good enough.

Even when he devoured the Grand Yan Immortals before, he could only absorb about 20 percent of their origin source. This was the might of the sword from that master, and even though the contained origin source was exceptionally scarce and had been diminishing over the years, being able to study the sword again was already remarkable.

“Imprisonment!” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow.

This masterful sword stroke oddly resembled his Heartsword Realm. However, his Heartsword Realm was far from complete; it was more like a piece of paper. The sword stroke from the master, on the other hand, was akin to a paper ball sculpted with care.

Jian Wushuang had gained some insights, but it was far from enough for a breakthrough. Nevertheless, he was already satisfied with his gains this time.

Swoosh!

His figure shifted, and he arrived where Hu Qing and the others were waiting.

It had been a month since the events unfolded. Yet, Qiuhuang City remained eerily silent, and impatience gnawed at the people gathered there.

Fortunately, the rankings had stabilized, so no one was willing to instigate conflicts. The city offered excellent conditions for cultivation, and they could endure the wait, even though the allure of the grand city tempted their senses. The battle scars on the city walls alone promised immense benefits, let alone what lay within.

Jian Wushuang descended gracefully, surveying the surroundings. This area, an annex to the city gate, was where most strong cultivators gathered to contemplate. They hoped that if the city gate were to suddenly open, they could be the first ones inside.

“There are nearly 400,000 cultivators here!” Jian Wushuang glanced over the crowd, speaking casually.

Ji Chaoyang had little interest in contemplating the battle marks left by the powerful cultivators. He was confident in his own ultimate path and dismissed the significance of those combat imprints. Bored, he waited, and upon seeing Jian Wushuangs return, a smile played on his lips.

“Brother Wushuang, surprising, isn’t it? I never expected so many timid turtles hiding here. I thought there would be at most 100,000 people!” Ji

Chaoyang sneered at the crowd, his disdain palpable.

Jian Wushuang merely smiled faintly, choosing not to retort. Ji Chaoyang had arrived in the Original Universe with the strength of a half-step Dao Lord; he had no understanding of how arduous it was for the weaker ones.

Jian Wushuang had once survived in the mountains with Hu Qing, laying traps and ambushing the Grand Yan Immortals. He knew firsthand the struggles of the weaker cultivators.

At that time, they possessed the formidable power of peak-level Grand Yan Immortals. Through battles, they grew stronger, eventually slaying extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals and defeating the God-Emperor MO Long in combat.

Later, they entered the Feather Continent and underwent a profound transformation.

“Let’s wait a little longer! They must be waiting for everyone to gather,” Jian Wushuang speculated.

The Qiuhuang City would open sooner or later; there was probably a time limit.

Anyway, they weren’t waiting in vain; didn’t the battle traces of those powerful beings provide them with insights?

Entities capable of leaving marks on this city wall were at least strong among Emperors.

Especially that white-robed Sword God; Jian Wushuangs eyes were filled with longing.

Formidable!

Once the seed of strength was planted in the heart of a strong person, it could never be stilled.

That white-robed Sword Dao expert had left a strong impression on Jian Wushuang. With one sword move, he had shattered the city.

So, the other traces left behind must have been from powerful beings weaker than the white-robed Sword God.

However, even if they were weaker, they were still countless times stronger than them.

While they were still quietly waiting, outside the Feather Continent, practitioners were hardly seen anymore. In just a month, even if a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal hurried with all their might, they would have almost reached the Feather Continent.

At this point, with the summoning sensation so intense, if there were still people unwilling to come, it was likely that they were beyond salvation.

Darkness descended from the void, covering the mountains in an instant before spreading to the Feathered Continent. The Grand Yan Immortals who hadn’t yet arrived at the continent couldn’t sit still anymore. They emerged from their mountain caves and took to the skies.

“What is this?” a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal gazed at the spreading darkness, his heart shaken.

Danger!

A powerful sense of crisis, sudden and overwhelming, left them with no room for resistance. They all desperately fled.

Similar scenes played out on other Original Planets.

Inside the Vermilion Bird Temple.

“Is one month too short?” Zhu Yi, hands behind her back, stared at a screen below the main hall, displaying the movements of all the Original Planets. She calmly spoke, “It’s not short. Their time is precious. We’ve already wasted a month.’

“A month’s time, even if they were slow, would have been enough to reach the continent. Ignoring the summons for so long, insisting on hiding like turtles, it’s a cowardly move!”

Zhu Yi was somewhat resentful.

She had provided plenty of warnings already. If it were the old guardian, she guessed he wouldn’t even leave behind the summoning crystal, taking the inheritance and running.

The inheritances weren’t given for free. This was just an appetizer, testing

their ambition. If they lacked even this bit of ambition, the Qishen Temple wouldn’t harbor idlers.

The people who had arrived outside Qiuhuang City were still unaware of any issues.

They didn’t realize they had already passed the first test!

As darkness fell, the Grand Yan Immortals trapped within it desperately fled, trying to break free.

Crack!

One Grand Yan Immortal was snapped in half, blood splattering!

In the darkness, a pair of crimson eyes gleamed.

Hehe…

The killed Grand Yan Immortal not only had his body devoured, but even his origin source was completely consumed by these creatures. If Jian Wushuang saw this, he’d probably acknowledge their expertise. A Grand Yan Immortal’s intact origin source was devoured cleanly, without any waste.

In terms of consumption, they were masters!Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The darkness continued to expand, covering 90 percent of the territory of the Original Planets. Finally, the source of darkness converged on the edge of the Feather Continent and began advancing.

This time, the spread was a bit slower, but still several times faster than the Grand Yan Immortals. It would take just a quarter of an hour to reach Qiuhuang City.

Buzz!

The towering pillar inside Qiuhuang City vibrated. A burst of searing light exploded, as if shattering the barrier in the sky.

Outside the city, 400,000 practitioners stood up, looking up.

Crackle!

The entire city vibrated, and the protective barrier enveloping it shattered, turning into electric serpents swimming in the sky above Qiuhuang City..
