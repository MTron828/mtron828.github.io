Chapter 3791: Choice

“Of course, there are too many changes in a battle, and you can’t only use one method that consumes divine power. Even if your divine power is hundreds or thousands of times more vast than ordinary cultivators, you can’t be so extravagant as to recklessly use this divine power burning secret technique. But no matter what, if you have this divine power burning secret technique, it will be much more convenient than other cultivators.”

“Other cultivators, even if they have the divine power burning secret skill, use it as their ultimate trump card to fight for their lives. But you can use it as long as you feel it’s necessary. After all, you have a lot of divine power, so it’s not a big deal even if you burn 10-20% of it,” Lord Wu said.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly and began to think about it in his heart.

Indeed, compared to ordinary cultivators, he had a huge advantage in divine power.

The divine power burning secret skill could last for a long time even if he burned it at all costs.

With his strength, an ordinary life-and-death battle would not last long. It might even end in an instant. In his hands, the divine power burning secret skill could become a sharp blade, it was also a big trump card, and it could last much longer than ordinary cultivators.

“It’s decided. I want the dragon-exterminating secret skill.” Jian Wushuang had made up his mind.

After careful consideration, he confirmed that among the 36 secret skills, he could only cultivate more than 10 of them.

Among the 10 secret skills, the dragon-exterminating secret skill should be the most helpful to his strength.

According to Lord Wu, the divine power burning secret skill was extremely rare in the universe. If he missed it this time, he would not know whether he could get another divine power burning secret skill next time.

“Little guy, trust me. You won’t regret choosing the dragon-killing secret skill,” Lord Wu said with certainty.

Jian Wushuang smiled. Then he received the information of the dragon-killing secret skill according to Lord Wu’s instructions.

Although the dragon-killing secret skill was recorded in the token, Jian Wushuang could not take it directly.

Instead, under the guidance of Lord Wu, the information in the token entered his mind and formed a memory.

Soon, the complete information method of the dragon-exterminating secret skill was completely imprinted in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“This dragon-exterminating secret skill is actually so powerful.”

After completely receiving the information of the dragon-exterminating secret skill, Jian Wushuang was shocked and overjoyed.

He had thought that the dragon-exterminating secret skill was just a simple method to burn divine power. He did not expect that the dragon-exterminating secret skill could burn divine power in different levels.

The dragon-exterminating secret skill was divided into three volumes.

The first volume could be cultivated by the Principles Master. After burning divine power, one’s strength would increase by 100 times.

The second volume could be cultivated by the Ruler. The burning speed of divine power would increase by 10 times, and the strength would increase by 1,000 times.

In the third volume, the burning speed of divine power was increased by a hundred times, and the strength was increased by ten thousand times!

“Terrifying, it’s too terrifying!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

At the level of Principles Master, his strength was increased by a hundred times, and at the level of Ruler and Master, it was increased by a thousand times and ten thousand times.

Of course, the burning of divine power could only increase the power. As for his understanding of the Dao and understanding of the universe principles, he had not improved his ultimate moves. Moreover, in the second and third volumes.., the burning of divine power would also increase by 10 times or 100 times, which meant that the consumption of divine power was increasing.

Even so, it was still very abnormal.

“I’m now a Principles Master, so I can cultivate the first volume. Once I succeed...my battle strength will be at the level of a Superior Ruler. Once I use the dragon-killing secret skill to increase my power by 100 times, my battle strength will be able to soar to the level of a second-level Ruler. I’m afraid that among the second-level Rulers, I’m not weak, but I’m at the level of an advanced or even Superior Ruler.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes were shining brightly.

He felt that as long as he mastered this secret skill, his battle strength would be able to reach a new level.

In the future, even if the Devil Cloud Star Master came to kill him personally, he would be more confident in dealing with him.

“Although this dragon-killing secret skill is powerful, it’s not too complicated. You just need to spend some time to master the first volume. Of course, you don’t need to cultivate now. After all, this is the Red Cloud World. You Won’t encounter any danger here, and you won’t be able to use the dragon-killing secret skill in the Second Heaven. So it’s not too late for you to cultivate when you leave the Red Cloud World or when you’re about to leave,” Lord Wu said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“By the way, Lord Wu, you said that there are many opportunities in the Second Heaven? What opportunities are there?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The opportunities in the Second Heaven are on this island.” Lord Wu smiled. “Although this island is small, it contains countless opportunities. Some of these opportunities are left behind by experts of the Red Cloud lineage. Of course, most of them come from the outside world and are of a very high level. Of course, your strength is still too weak, and you haven’t even comprehended the universe principles. You can only see a little of the opportunities in the Second Heaven, but even if it’s just a little, it should be of great help to you.”

“For example, the Sword Stone that was born in the First Heaven during the opening of the Red Cloud World...”

“Sword Stone?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He had studied the Sword Stone in the First Heaven for 5,000 years.

During these 5,000 years, not only had his comprehension of the sword principle origin improved greatly, but he had also perfected his earth protection sword skill.

It could be said that the Sword Stone was very helpful to him, and it contained a total of four sword skills. He had only comprehended one sword skill before comprehending the body-protecting sword skill.

If he was not worried that the Red Cloud World would only open for 10,000 years, he did not want to waste too much time on the Sword Stone. Otherwise, he would have studied the other three sword skills under the Sword Stone.

“Is the Sword Stone related to the Second Heaven?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“Yes.” Lord Wu nodded. “In the First Heaven of the Red Cloud World, there will occasionally be some special opportunities. In fact, these special opportunities do not belong to the First Heaven, but come from the Second Heaven. For example, the Sword Stone comes from the Second Heaven. There is not only one Sword Stone, but a total of 11 Sword Stones. On each Sword Stone, there are four golden characters. Each golden character has a sword skill that has reached the pinnacle of a Ruler.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang immediately became excited.

Each of the 11 Sword Stones was engraved with four golden characters. Each golden character contained a swordsmanship that had reached the ultimate level of a Ruler?
