Chapter 876: The Most Powerful Nine Secret Skills

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As the sword light came down, the boundless fire around quenched instantly and didn’t stir any sparks anymore.

“Such an overmatch!”

Jian Wushuang felt extremely shocked.

“How do you feel about Blood Mountain?” said Qian Yu, looking towards him.

“Unbelievable!” Jian Wushuang acclaimed.

The following two images and the swordsmanship performed within them had given Jian Wushuang an obscure feeling.

A myriad of thoughts crowded into his mind when he just skimmed it quickly.

“There are nearly 16 patterns on the Star Jade Wall and each of pattern displays an inconceivable movement of swordsmanship. As for Eternal Realm, we would spend long ages exploring the swordsmanship.”

“Besides, each of the 16 movements is different and each of them represents a specific direction. If you want to meditate them, you’d better select one pattern and concentrate on it,” said Qian Yu.

“Understood,” replied Jian Wushuang, nodding his head slightly.

Although he skimmed only two patterns, he had distinguished the difference of the swordsmanship between two patterns.

The first swordsmanship was to focus all the power into one point without wasting any of it, uncanny yet profound.

The second movement, with amazing power, was destructive.

The two movements of swordsmanship were performed by the same people, but the quality and significance of them were distinct from one another.

“You can study the Star Jade Wall later. Now I’m going to show you where the nine Secret Skills are located,” said Qian Yu.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded and then he followed Qian Yu to the place.

The nine Secret Skills with a good fame were located on Star Island.

People on Star Island were filled with longing for the nine Secret Skills.

However, it was mandated by Lord Spirit Sound that only Dao Master or people who could pass through Level One of black tower were allowed to select one of the Secret Skills to cultivate.

On Star Island, only the five Dao Masters and twelve kings were qualified to cultivate the Secret Skills.

Jian Wushuang followed Qian Yu and they came to an exquisite pavilion.

“Inside the pavilion, there is a technique of cultivating the nine Secret Skills. Lord Spirit Sound has set a Restriction outside the pavilion that people who have passed through Level One of black tower were admitted to the pavilion. So there was no way to let you in. You would have to go in there yourself.” Qian Yu said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded as he headed to the pavilion.

Soon, he had come inside the pavilion.

Upon entering the pavilion, Jian Wushuang saw a broad clearing, where there were nine raised jade tables at the very center.

On each jade table, there was a Jade Slip.

“Those Jade Slips were the nine Secret Skills on Star Island, weren’t they?” Jian Wushuang found it confusing.

At this moment, an enchanting shadow in red suddenly appeared inside the pavilion, exactly in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Spirit Sound!” Jian Wushuang immediately looked to him.

“I have guessed that you would pass through Level One of black tower. You didn’t disappoint me,” Lord Spirit Sound smiled and continued. “Each of the nine Jade Slips before you has a Secret Skill and each of them is distinctive. In terms of your vision, they can definitely be called the most powerful Secret Skills.”

“You can select any of the nine Secret Skills to cultivate. On Star Island, there are also some special places where people can cultivate these Secret Skills. Select one Secret Skill and enter the corresponding special place.”

“Now you can select.”

Raising his eyebrows, Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and moved forward to the nine Jade Slips.

At first, he walked before the first Jade Slip.

His eyes tarted towards the Jade Slip as a flow of messages directly came into his mind.

“The Secret Skill of Famine...?is a power amplitude typed Secret Skill.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Secret Skill of Famine had nine layers altogether, and the power of each layer could enhance by nine times. If getting to an extreme, one would improve his or her offensive power by 81 times.

Divine Realm expert could cultivate the first three layers of the nine Secret Skills, while the immediate three layers are for the Eternal Realm and the last three layers for Dao Master.

Such a brief introduction made his eyes come abruptly back.

“A power amplitude typed Secret Skill?” Jian Wushuang felt much astounded.

He was actually not so strange to this Secret Skill. Instead, he was quite familiar to it.

Star-river Secret Skill, which was one of the three Ancient God Secret Skills he cultivated, belonged to power amplitude Secret Skill and was very horrible.

Jian Wushuang was just a Divine Realm expert, but why was he not inferior to an ordinary Eternal Realm expert and even superior to an Eternal Realm expert with his basic strength bursting out?

It was not just because of Jian Wushuang’s Inverse Cultivation.

The major reason was that he had cultivated Star-river Secret Skill.

Now, he had achieved the 14 layers of Star-river Secret Skill with its power amplitude reaching by 42 times.

If one wanted to cultivate such a Secret Skill in the Eternal World to its full play, he could just reach ten times of its power amplitude.

Like those Eternal Realm experts or Dao Master in the Eternal World, they all had cultivated such a Secret Skill, but they could only turn them all up to ten times.

Compared with the one reaching ten times, Jian Wushuang who had reached 42 times, 32 more than the previous ones.

It had brought Jian Wushuang tremendous advantages, so he would be this tough as his basic strength burst out.

The first Secret Skill Jian Wushuang saw on Star Island was exactly a power amplitude Secret Skill which could be reached by 81 times.

81 times! Though inferior to the 100 times of Star-river Secret Skill Jian Wushuang cultivated, the Secret Skill of famine was far enough to make many Warriors in the Eternal World go crazy.

“If such a Secret Skill exists in the Eternal World, it will definitely cause a stir. However, it is almost useless for me,” Jian Wushuang said, shaking his head.

Since he had cultivated Star-river Secret Skill, he surely wouldn’t cultivate the Secret Skill of famine.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang took a few steps forward and stopped before the second Jade Slip, watching the Secret Skill in it.

“The frozen and snow-covered world... is a Realm typed Secret Skill...”

On seeing such an introduction, Jian Wushuang suddenly changed his expression, “Realm typed Secret Skill?”

He appeared to get such a Realm typed Secret Skill in the Ancient World.

At that time, it did have some positive effects on him.

As he entered the Eternal World, the Secret Skill grew useless. So he didn’t perform it anymore.

Now, he saw such a Secret Skill again on Star Island.

Jian Wushuang immediately began looking through the introduction of the Secret Skill carefully.

“The frozen and snow-covered world is not bad. If I’m successful to cultivate it, it will play a big part for me either in one-to-one killing or in a scrimmage.”

“But, unfortunately...”
