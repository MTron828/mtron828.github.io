Chapter 3037: The Mountaintop

——

Di Mountain, on the mountainside.

There were also three gatekeepers on the mountainside, just like at the foot of the mountain. One of them was good at close combat, and their attacks were tyrannical.

The other was good at speed, and good at sneak attacks and assassinations.

The last person knew how to use soul attacks, and his soul techniques were incomparably powerful. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The difference was that the three gatekeepers on the mountainside were much more powerful than the three at the foot of the mountain.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. He slashed out his Blood Mountain Sword and performed the Evil Xiang move. The terrifying sword light collided with the sledgehammer wielded by a strong young man. Although he had the upper hand, the strong young man was not defeated by him. He was not completely crushed.

Next to him, an evil-looking young man slashed at Jian Wushuang’s head again and again.

The last gatekeeper, who was not far away, used his soul attack to affect Jian Wushuang.

The three of them worked well together, which put a lot of pressure on Jian Wushuang.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang finally burst out.

His silver light movement suddenly burst out, and his speed completely surpassed the fastest of the three. He directly appeared in front of the gatekeeper who had used soul attack. Then he used Star Dream, which was so fast, the gatekeeper did not have time to react and was killed on the spot.

After one of the three was killed, the other two obviously could not defeat Jian Wushuang, so they were soon defeated by Jian Wushuang one by one.

They passed the mountainside.

…

Finally, Jian Wushuang arrived at the top of Di Mountain.

There were also three gatekeepers on the mountaintop. They were a stocky elder and two women, one black and one white.

“Master left Di Mountain behind and set three tests. You passed the two tests at the foot and the mountainside. This proves that your talent is not weak. Even in the vast Divine Beginning World, you can be considered a first-class genius. But that’s it,” the stocky elder said.

“You’ll never pass the test of the three of us,” the white-robed woman also said.

“How would I know if I don’t try?” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

Soon, he fought with the three gatekeepers.

After the real battle, Jian Wushuang understood why Elder Gu had said that the probability of him passing the test was very low.

It was because the test on the mountaintop was too difficult.

Although the three gatekeepers on the mountaintop had also displayed the power of a rank one True Saint, each of them had reached the peak of a rank three True Saint in terms of their comprehension of the rules and Dao!

Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the space-time principles and sword principle was only at the peak of a rank three True Saint. Any one of the three could fight him head-on, and it was hard to predict who would win.

But now it was a three-on-one fight. The three of them were working well together. Under such circumstances, how could he be a match for them.

Jian Wushuang held on for a while, but he was defeated in the end.

As soon as he was defeated, Jian Wushuang was immediately sent out of Di Mountain.

“I failed!”

Jian Wushuang returned to the hall with a sigh.

“Little guy, how do you feel?” Elder Gu looked at him with interest.

“Too weak. Any one of the three gatekeepers on the top of the mountain is equal to me. If the three of them work together, I’m no match for them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’ve already said that it’s very unlikely for you to pass the test left by master. It’s true, but don’t take it too seriously. I can see that you’ve just reached the Immortal Saint level, and your strength is still in an explosive stage. You still have a lot of room to improve your strength at the level of a rank one True Saint.”

“Judging from your fight with the three gatekeepers on the top of Di Mountain, you are not too far away from passing the test. As long as you can make great progress in the future, you should be able to pass it.” Elder Gu smiled and said.

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

It was true that he could not pass Di Mountain’s test, but he was not too far away from passing the test. He was close to passing it. With such a small gap, as long as he made some progress in his strength, he should be able to pass it.

“Now, under the situation where I can’t fully utilize my strength, I can’t deal with the joint attack of the three gatekeepers. If I want to defeat the three of them, I can only make a big breakthrough in the rules or sword principle.”

Among the rules and sword principle, his comprehension of reincarnation principles was even lower than the space-time principles. Even if he improved to the same level as the space-time principles, the increase in his battle strength was minimal. He was afraid that he would still be unable to pass the test on the top of the mountain.

As for the sword principle, although his immeasurable sword tree was already 6600 feet tall, his understanding of the sword principle was not very high. However, it was very difficult to improve the sword principle. In a short time…Jian Wushuang could not make great progress in his sword principle.

The only thing he could improve now was the space-time principle!

“Space-time principle…right!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up. Then he flipped his hand and took out a golden stone the size of an infant’s fist.

Looking at the golden stone, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with a strange light.

This golden stone was the strange stone that contained the space-time divine principle.

Jian Wushuang had stepped into the space-time temple from this golden stone and learned the heaven-designated skill.

However, the heaven-designated skill was only one of the first moves of the space-time divine principle.

Jian Wushuang knew that there were two moves of the space-time divine principle contained in this golden stone alone.

However, because his comprehension of the space-time principles was too low, he was not qualified to learn the second move. Now, his comprehension of the spacetime rules had greatly improved, reaching the limit of the second stage, he could try to learn the second move of the space-time divine skill.

Most importantly, when Jian Wushuang was comprehending the first move of the space-time divine skill, the heaven-designated skill, his comprehension of the space-time principle had also greatly improved.

Now, his comprehension of the space-time principle had reached the limit of the second stage. He could use the second move of the space-time divine skill to improve his comprehension of the space-time principles so that his comprehension of the space-time principles could reach the third stage!

Once his comprehension of the space-time principles reached the third stage, he would have the confidence to pass the test on the top of Di Mountain.

Thinking of this, the light in his eyes grew brighter.
