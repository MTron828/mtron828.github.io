Chapter 3006: Golden Mountain Sect

——

Jian Wushuang continued to flee.

In the void far away from Jian Wushuang, the Sect Master of the Golden Mountain Sect and the others were also following him.

However, because Jian Wushuang had long disappeared from their sight, they could only rely on other people’s messages to find his location.

“That guy really can escape. Even when Tian Mound King and Stone Saint joined hands, they couldn’t stop him. Instead, he killed him!” The black-robed elder sighed.

“Humph, he’s just a turtle in a jar, struggling to survive.” Golden Mountain Sect Master was very disdainful.

But at this time…

“No, Golden Mountain Sect Master, something’s wrong.” The green-clothed girl suddenly exclaimed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What’s wrong?” Sect Master Jin Shan looked over in confusion.

“It’s the direction the man fled to. Sect Master Jin Shan, haven’t you noticed?” The green-clothed girl said with an interesting expression.

Sect Master Jin Shan frowned and quickly thought about Jian Wushuang’s current position and the direction he had fled to.

The next moment, Sect Master Jin Shan suddenly raised his head, and a fierce gleam flashed in his eyes. “Oh no! Golden Mountain Sect, the direction he fled to is exactly where Golden Mountain Sect is!”

“Quick, let’s go there!”

Golden Mountain Sect Master was really anxious this time.

He did not care about how many experts Jian Wushuang had killed in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. After all, those who were killed did not have much to do with him. At most, they were under the command of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

In fact, he did not care about whether he could kill Jian Wushuang or not.

But now it was different.

Jian Wushuang was fleeing in the direction of the Golden Mountain Sect, which was his sect!

It would be fine if Jian Wushuang just flew over the Golden Mountain Sect, but if he really used some means or directly broke into the Golden Mountain Sect…

“Quick, hurry up!” The Golden Mountain Sect Master’s voice was as anxious as fire. At the same time, he immediately sent a message to the experts in the Golden Mountain Sect, asking them to fully activate the sect-protecting formation of the Golden Mountain Sect and prepare to defend against the enemy.

Even so, he still felt uneasy.

Because he knew that if Jian Wushuang really rushed into the Golden Mountain Sect with his strength, the Golden Mountain Sect would definitely suffer.

And most importantly, he also knew that the sect-protecting formation of the Golden Mountain Sect was not very powerful. If Jian Wushuang used his swordsmanship at full strength, he could completely tear the sect-protecting formation apart.

Now, he only hoped that Jian Wushuang would pass by the Golden Mountain Sect and not pay too much attention to it.

In fact, Jian Wushuang really did not know about the existence of the Golden Mountain Sect.

He was not familiar with the territory of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Now, he was just running for his life and did not care about directions at all.

It was purely a coincidence that he was going in the direction of the Golden Mountain Sect.

“Sect?”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had already seen the Ancient Sect in the huge canyon ahead.

The sect looked extremely mysterious under the cover of a great formation.

Jian Wushuang’s soul power swept through and directly saw the scene inside the sect clearly through the great formation.

“There are so many experts in this sect.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

His soul power could clearly sense the aura of many experts hidden in the sect.

Among these experts, there were more than a dozen Immortal Saints. Although most of them were False Saints, there were two True Saints.

This was true for Immortal Saints, but there were even more Divine Masters.

The entire sect was densely packed with all kinds of Divine Masters’ auras. There were many Great Divine Masters.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up. “I have an idea.”

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang, who had been frantically running forward, suddenly changed his direction and rushed toward the ancient sect below.

The sect-protecting formation covering the entire sect was immediately activated.

“Although I don’t know who founded this sect and what position they stand on, I can only apologize for letting me leave safely today,” Jian Wushuang said softly, but the Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hand.

Endless sword essence rolled, and in the next moment, the Blood Mountain Sword slashed toward the sect-protecting formation at lightning speed.

What Jian Wushuang displayed was a move that focused on attack power, Xi Xiang’s move.

This powerful move, together with Jian Wushuang’s powerful divine power, directly hit the sect-protecting formation. Immediately, there was a violent rumble on the sect-protecting formation, and then the entire formation collapsed.

“It’s broken.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, but in the next moment, he suddenly rushed into the sect below.

The huge sect was also in an uproar because of Jian Wushuang’s sudden arrival.

In the void not far away, the Golden Mountain Sect Master looked anxious and quickened his pace.

Suddenly…

“Golden Mountain Sect Master, I just received news that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has broken the sect-protecting formation of Golden Mountain Sect and directly entered the sect,” said the green-clothed girl next to him.

“Damn it!”

A violent aura suddenly burst out of the Golden Mountain Sect Master’s body, and his speed increased again, directly shaking off the few True Saints beside him.

At this moment, the Golden Mountain Sect was indeed in chaos.

Golden Mountain Sect had been warned by the Golden Mountain Sect Master to be on guard. Not only did they activate the sect-protecting formation, but the dozen or so Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect were also ready to deal with the possible changes that might happen next.

In the end… The change did happen.

However, the change was completely beyond their imagination. Jian Wushuang directly broke through their sect-protecting formation with one sword move, and then he directly rushed down.

The dozen or so Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect immediately went up to meet him, but in just a moment, four of them were killed by Jian Wushuang on the spot. The others were scared and fled.

After that, Jian Wushuang did not linger in the fight. Instead, he directly rushed into a nearby temple and disappeared from everyone’s sight for a short while.

When ‘Jian Wushuang’ appeared again, he was still wearing a gray robe and a gray mask. However, anyone who was careful could see that he had changed to a magic weapon and held a blood sword in his hand.

In addition, he seemed to have grown a little taller.

Of course, the experts of the Gold Mountain Sect who were in chaos did not have the time to care about this.

“Run, run!”

“Run!”

“If we don’t run, we will die here.”

In the Gold Mountain Sect, countless disciples and experts rushed out and frantically fled in all directions. Only the Immortal Saints stayed behind to stop or kill ‘Jian Wushuang’.

Among them, there was a young man in a golden robe…
