Chapter 2808: The Cold Man

(Fourth update!)

——

As Jian Wushuang’s realm increased, he needed more and more sacred elixirs.

Even if he got more than 200,000 sacred pills, he would not be able to make another breakthrough. However, it was not a problem for him to increase his divine power.

“During my fight with Palace Master Nan Wu, I created the ultimate skill, the eighth move of the space-time sword skill. When I created the sword skill, my understanding of sword principle and space-time rules improved greatly. Now that I have calmed down, I can study it and digest all the progress.”

Jian Wushuang murmured. Soon, he closed his eyes and began to refine the sacred elixirs. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Time passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye, 12 years had passed.

During these 12 years, Crimson Rock Castle had completely controlled the territories that the four top forces had given up. It had also arranged the experts from the four top forces and made good use of them. The power of Crimson Rock Castle suddenly soared, it began to regain its former dominance over the Danyang Continent.

Over the past 12 years, all the forces in the vast Danyang Continent had submitted to the Crimson Rock Castle.

Of course, these forces did not include the Sword Union.

During the past 12 years, the Sword Union did not continue to expand because of Jian Wushuang’s restriction. It also did not have any disputes with the Crimson Rock Castle.

Naturally, the Crimson Rock Castle was not stupid enough to provoke the Sword Union.

In other words, both sides were trying their best to restrain themselves and maintain their alliance.

They were at the edge of the Danyang Continent. In a hidden valley, several figures were standing there waiting respectfully.

These people were the people of the Heaven Void Palace led by Chen Kong.

In the battle 12 years ago, the Heaven Void Palace and the Blood Thunder King faction had joined hands, but they were defeated by Yin Su’er and Jian Wushuang. Several senior great divine masters of the Heaven Void Palace had also died at the hands of Jian Wushuang.

However, after the battle, the people of the Heaven Void Palace did not immediately leave the Pill Sun Sacred World. Instead, they found a place to hide.

Buzz! Buzz!

A burst of dazzling light suddenly lit up somewhere in the valley.

This light was produced by the activation of a wormhole hidden in the valley.

The light gradually faded, and a figure slowly appeared in front of Chen Kong and the others.

This person was wearing a stone-green brocade robe. He had dark-red hair and a pair of deep and wise peach blossom eyes. His body was quite handsome, but his expression was incomparably cold.

The moment he appeared in front of Chen Kong’s group, Chen Kong and the experts from the Heavenly Void Palace immediately bowed in unison. “Greetings, sir!”

This cold man did not glance at Chen Kong’s group in front of him. Instead, he randomly looked around him, “The Pill Sun Sacred Realm... hasn’t been here for quite some time. The last time I came, I came to see that Crimson Rock Saint. But now, that Crimson Rock Saint is long dead.”

Chen Kong and the others listened to the cold-looking man muttering to himself, but they did not dare to interrupt him. Instead, they all lowered their heads.

They were very clear about the cold-looking man in front of them. He was the most trusted person of their Lord Palace Master, and he was also his right-hand man.

There were many things in the Golden Crow Nine Realms that their palace lord could not handle personally. He had always sent this cold-looking man to handle them, and this time was no exception.

After a long while, the cold-looking man finally turned his eyes to Chen Kong and the others. “Tell me, what exactly happened?”

Chen Kong immediately spoke, recounting the scene of the great battle and the events that had happened in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“My lord, I was indeed incompetent in this matter. I thought that after joining hands with the Blood Thunder King, we should be able to take control of the Crimson Rock Castle. I did not expect that the Crimson Rock Castle would actually invite the Sword Alliance as a helper. The current situation on the Pill Sun Continent is completely different from before. The Crimson Rock Fort has already taken control of everything and respects Yin Su’er completely. Under such circumstances, I really can’t continue to complete the mission given by the Palace Master, so I can only ask for your help, my Lord.” Chen Kong was extremely respectful.

Hearing Chen Kong’s words, the cold man narrowed his eyes. “Are you saying that you lost because of one person, and that person is now publicly acknowledged as the number one expert in the Pill Sun Sacred World?”

“Yes, that Sword One’s strength is extremely terrifying. He killed Palace Head Nan Wu in that battle, and he killed three Peak-stage Great Divine Masters in one go. Killing ordinary High-level Great Divine Masters was like slaughtering chickens and dogs. His strength is too strong!” Chen Kong said hurriedly.

“Sword One and Yin Su’er have always been on the same side. With him around, even if I ask Palace Master to mobilize more people, I’m afraid I won’t be able to do anything to Crimson Rock Castle.”

“He killed Palace Master Nan Wu in a head-on battle?” The cold man’s expression changed, “Although I’ve never fought Palace Master Nan Wu before, I’ve heard of him. His strength is indeed quite good, but Sword One was able to kill him in a head-on battle. Could it be that he’s already become an Invincible Divine Master?”

“I don’t know if he’s an Invincible Divine Master or not, but he did create an ultimate technique in that battle. His true realm is only that of a Senior Great Divine Master,” Chen Kong said.

“Senior Great Divine Master?” The cold man was startled, “Haha, a Senior Great Divine Master actually killed Palace Master Nan Wu directly and could easily kill a Peak Great Divine Master. This is interesting. Even I’m interested in him. Tell me, where is sword one now?”

“He is in the Sword Union. If you want to go, I can lead the way,” Chen Kong said.

“Lead the way.” The cold man waved his hand.

Chen Kong did not dare to be negligent and immediately led the way.

Not long after, Chen Kong brought the cold man to the vicinity of the Sword Union’s headquarters.

“Sir, that is where the Sword Union’s headquarters is. Jian Yi is inside right now,” Chen Kong said.

“Mm.” The cold man nodded slightly. His figure slowly moved forward and arrived in the void above the headquarters of the Sword Union.

“Sword One!”

The cold voice came out of the cold man’s mouth. It seemed to be a casual voice, but after being transmitted by divine power, the voice was like rolling thunder, echoing continuously in the world.

“Sword One! Sword One! Sword One!”

The echoes reverberated throughout the world and did not disappear for a long time.

Many experts of the Sword Union were instantly alarmed.

“Who, who dares to be presumptuous in front of the gate of our Sword Union!”

“How dare he call the name of the Alliance Master directly? How dare he!”

“Even if the lord of Crimson Rock Castle, Yin Su’er, came here personally, he would still have to politely call our Alliance Master as Mr. Sword One. Now, where did this fool who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth come from?”

A series of shocked and angry voices sounded one after another.

From the Sword Alliance’s nest, figures rushed out one after another.

At the same time, those top experts of the Sword Alliance, such as Elder Tong, Great Divine Master Jue Xin, and others had also appeared in the void.
