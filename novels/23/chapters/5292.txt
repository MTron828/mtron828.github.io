Chapter 5291 - 5291: Reverse

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Emperor Fengyu sat on the throne, her face turning red with anger.

She bellowed, “Fine! Since you’re unwilling to take the gamble, then we will. You can leave now.”

Upon hearing this, those who opposed her revealed their reluctance once again.

A group of tier 4 Devouring Demons stood outside; if they were to go out, they would be instantly pulverized.

“Ruler Fengyu, we are still considering this matter. Give us some time,” someone pleaded.

“Yeah, after all, it’s one unit of origin source. Even if we cultivate here, it would take several epochs!” others chimed in, trying to persuade her.

However, Fengyu, as a Demon Lord, was not one to vacillate.

Her stern face twitched slightly, and she spoke coldly, “I’ll give you three breaths’ time. If you don’t decide, 1 will personally send you out.”

Her tone left no room for negotiation.

After all, there were people waiting for their response outside, and she couldn’t afford to delay.

They needed to make a decision quickly, confirm the authenticity, and, if it was false, retreat.

The Devouring Demon Lord with the crimson cloak possessed immense power. Although he couldn’t shake the Eternal Tower, a single attack could injure a tier 4 Emperor.

His attacks were swift, striking tens of thousands of times within a single breath. They wouldn’t be able to withstand it. A decision had to be made at this moment.

They couldn’t afford to drag this out.

There was no benefit, and no solution in sight. It was simply a waste of time.

“We agree!’

In the end, these people compromised. Leaving meant certain death, but staying meant they could at least put up a fight.

Chishui remained expressionless, but a trace of a sneer escaped his heart.

He had also agreed!

One unit of origin source meant nothing to him as a Special Life Form.

He wanted to contradict Emperor Fengyu!

This was a strategic move.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If they lost the gamble, Fengyu would undoubtedly become the target of everyone’s resentment. At that time, he could step forward and take charge of the situation.

In the Original Universe, among the five major peak powers, aside from the

Eternal Tower, the strengths of the other forces were more or less the same.

Otherwise, Chang Shentian wouldn’t have appointed him as the Supreme Elder back then.

These peak forces could deal with tier 3 Emperors or small factions, but when facing tier 4 peak-level experts, nobody would spare them a second thought.

Not even Fengyu.

Once they retreated below half the mountain’s height, the Eternal Tower lost its significance. At that point, no one would pledge allegiance to her. Instead, she might lose her prestige.

After all, it was her suggestion to contribute ten percent of their origin source.

That was the Emperor’s origin source!

10 percent, do you know how many years one needs to cultivate to obtain that much?

Under ordinary circumstances, it would be manageable. But this was not an ordinary time. This was the Qishen Temple, a land rich in great opportunities.

Losing 10 percent of the origin source here meant weakening their combat power by 30 percent.

Fengyu didn’t want to let them go because of this reason.

If they failed, their collective strength would diminish, providing an opportunity for people like Chishui.

Everything was part of a scheme.

It could only be said that Chuishui’s faction was currently in an advantageous position. If what that being said was true, Fengyu’s prestige would skyrocket to its peak. But for Chishui, it didn’t matter much.

He was a lone wolf, and he could continue his journey up the mountain.

Moreover, he wouldn’t tarnish his reputation. After all, none of them had suffered any losses.

Calculating all this, Fengyu’s decision carried the highest risk but also the greatest benefits.

Chishui faced the least risk and also stood to gain a lot.

Restraining others and suppressing Demon Lord Fengyu.

He didn’t care much for the Demon Sound Mountain. Despite being among the strongest, he always found himself trailing behind.

He tread this path with great difficulty, and naturally, the benefits he reaped were not as plentiful as the others’.

That’s why he opposed Fengyu, to sow discord.

This might not be apparent to others, but it was crystal clear in the minds of Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha.

Knowing that everything was a scheme, they firmly stood by the side of Ruler Fengyu.

From the beginning, they didn’t say much.

After the decision was made, Fengyu waved her sleeve, and a divine body emerged from the Eternal Tower.

Everything went smoothly!

Originally, Shan Jun was prepared to devour these Emperors, but with the presence of the Eternal Tower, Fengyu and the others hid inside.

He had no choice but to guard halfway up the mountain.

The two sides were in a stalemate.

Now, no matter how much origin source they could exchange, it was a profit.

Even if these people reached the mountaintop, what could they do? After all, they weren’t eating his family’s rice.

But all of this was only in the Vermilion Bird Temple. His relationship with Zhu Qi was the only reason he wasn’t interfering.

If it were a trial for Grand Yan Immortals, he wouldn’t allow such antics.

Shan Jun held a cluster of origin source and nodded.

With Jian Wushuang in tow, he directly reached the mountaintop.

Jian Wushuang also put away his true form and transformed into a human body.

“Little guy, do you know what true defiance is?” Shan Jun’s true form raised his hand and crushed dozens of tier 4 Emperors’ origin sources into a lump.

“l want this origin source, to reverse the strength of the divine body, and even reverse it into a lump of flesh and blood,” Shan Jun said with a ferocious expression.

Reverse!

This was true defiance!

In the past, what he had seen as defiance was just shouting slogans.

At most, within a small world, he could reverse some rule operations.

But within the universe, truly reversing the path of cultivation was genuine defiance.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was once again teleported into the Demon-Sealing Pillar.

On the Universe Bronze Furnace, Shan Jun’s divine body appeared. “If you grasp this opportunity, you can refine it to the extreme!” he said.

“What? Refine to the extreme?” Jian Wushuang was shocked!

Originally, it was thought Shan Jun wanted to extort Emperors, exchanging some of their Emperor’s origin source for him to devour. Who would have imagined that Shan Jun could reverse the origin source, transforming it into a mass of flesh and blood to help him complete his Nine Refinements of the

Flesh.

Swoosh!

A massive amount of origin source was invested by Shan Jun into the Universe Bronze Furnace.

This time, Shan Jun personally manipulated the Universe Bronze Furnace.

In just the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the furnace opened again.

“Remember, don’t be careless inside. After all, this is the Emperor’s flesh and blood. Even if you have an extraordinary physical body, it’s still difficult to integrate,” Shan Jun cautioned specifically.

Jian Wushuang nodded heavily, expressing his deep gratitude!

This opportunity was no less than Hu Qings inheritance. He would definitely go all out to integrate the Emperor’s flesh and blood. Not only would the foundation of his physical body rise, but it would also enhance his divine body considerably.

It all depended on the nourishment from this mass of flesh and blood.

Emperor’s flesh and blood shouldn’t be that bad, Jian Wushuang thought.

If placed in the treasure vault, such a large amount of Emperor’s flesh and blood could be divided into tens of thousands of portions, each worth at least several hundred thousand treasure points.

An immense opportunity.

Apart from the Beast God Weapons, this was the most powerful treasure Jian Wushuang had encountered since entering the Qishen Temple.

After entering the Universe Bronze Furnace, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged.

The Emperor’s flesh and blood resembled a meatball to him.

Floating above his head, countless veins instantly connected his entire body, ceaselessly supplying him with the essence and blood contained within. The precious Emperor’s essence and blood from the outside world was like a blood pillar to him..
