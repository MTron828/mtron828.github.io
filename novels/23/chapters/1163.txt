Chapter 1164: One Strike

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Senior, please advise me again!”

Jian Xiaoyao had already picked up his Triple-kill Sword. He stared at the blind old man, his eyes full of great passion and delight.

“Oh?” The old man smiled as he nodded.

Jian Xiaoyao drew out his sword again.

His movement was exceedingly fast and powerful, unleashing a torrent of Spiritual Power that formed a whirlpool.

“It’s the Traceless Sword Skill of Sword Marquis Mansion!” someone exclaimed.

The old man swung his bamboo stick.

“Thwack!”

Jian Xiaoyao’s Triple-kill Sword was thrown into the air again.

“Strike again, Senior!”

Jian Xiaoyao was not discouraged in the least. He picked up the Triple-kill Sword from the ground again and continued to thrust his sword at the old man.

“What a crafty strike! It looks like a viper.”

“Thwack!”

The Triple-kill Sword fell to the ground.

“That’s the Blood Moon Sword Skill of Sword Marquis Mansion!”

“Thwack!”

The Triple-kill Sword fell to the ground.

“That’s Jian Xiaoyao’s most powerful attack…”

“Thwack!”

The Triple-kill Sword ended up on the ground again.

…

Jian Xiaoyao launched a series of attacks, going all-out with each.

Even so, the blind old man continued to brandish his bamboo stick and toss Jian Xiaoyao’s sword into the air over and over again.

What astonished the crowd most was that the old man’s movement appeared slow and his blows weak.

However, Jian Xiaoyao failed to withstand his attacks.

Jian Xiaoyao had used more than ten Sword Skills throughout the dozen rounds of their fight but ended up losing his sword each time.

The outcome was the same even after so many times. The onlookers were all thoroughly dumbfounded.

No one had any doubt that this powerless-looking old man harbored an unpredictable strength.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Xiaoyao took a deep breath before looking at the blind old man with a serious look. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he kowtowed to the old man. “I’m Jian Xiaoyao. I implore you to take me as your disciple and teach me swordsmanship.”

“Disciple?”

“The genius of Sword Marquis Mansion wants to make this blind old man his master?”

“He’s the great genius who won the Easternmost Hunt. It’s rumored that many experts in the Yang Void Realm and Divine Transcendence Realm wanted him as a disciple but he had refused them all. But he’s now asking to be this old man’s disciple?”

Jian Xiaoyao’s action stirred heated discussions among the people on the street. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

That old man shook his head when he saw Jian Xiaoyao kneeling before him. “I’m not an expert. I’m not qualified to be your master. Speaking of swordsmanship… I know just one move which I use to punish my grandson. He’s a troublemaker and I hit his butt when he makes trouble. Are you willing to learn that?”

The crowd was confused. “Punish his grandson? He’s going to teach a technique to hit a child’s butt?”

“Yes.” Jian Xiaoyao kept nodding, his eyes filled with delight and desire.

“Fine. I’ll then impart this to you.”

The blind old man took a step forward and stopped in front of Jian Xiaoyao. He raised his wrinkled hand and pointed at Jian Xiaoyao’s midbrows. Then, he turned around and left.

Before leaving he left a string of words. “I owe the Red Sun Tavern some money. Go there and pay my bills off. That’s your tuition fee.”

Jian Xiaoyao’s eyes were wide open.

The scene of the old man brandishing his stick appeared in his mind, giving him a close look at the move that the old man used. Common as it appeared, it was a terrifyingshow of swordsmanship. It was not until now that Jian Xiaoyao realized this.

The reason he even thought that the old man’s strike was common was that he was weak and his realm was still too low.

“This is an opportunity, a golden opportunity!”

Jian Xiaoyao clenched his hands as he trembled with delight.

He then left for the Red Sun Tavern and paid for the blind old man’s liquor.

Meanwhile, there were two figures hovering side by side above the street.

One was an elegant woman dressed in a black robe, and the other was a middle-aged man in a splendid silver robe. The man emanated an air of majesty.

Both of them had been around to witness how the blind old man taught Jian Xiaoyao a lesson.

“Upper Elder, what do you think of this?” the middle-aged man asked, looking concerned.

“He’s strong,” the elegant woman replied with a serious look. “He didn’t use his Spiritual Power or other special powers in his attacks but still effortlessly tossed Jian Xiaoyao’s sword to the ground with technique alone!”

“But I can’t see anything special about his strike,” she added.

She furrowed her brows.

It was impossible for an attack, imbued with the strength of an ordinary human, capable of repeatedly unarming Jian Xiaoyao to be ordinary.

This could only prove that her realm was still too low.

“Eh? Where’s the old man?” The middle-aged man looked down at the street with a surprised expression.

They had been keeping an eye on the blind old man all along but in the blink of an eye, he had disappeared.

Suddenly, a gentle voice came from behind them. “Looking for me?”

“What?” Both the elegant woman and the middle-aged man were taken aback.

The man was evidently less than a meter away from them but they did not even know since when he had been standing there.

How did both of them fail to notice his arrival?

“Swish! Swish!”

When they turned around, they saw the blind old man standing there with a smile on his face and a stick in his hand. He was less than a meter away from them.

“You…” the elegant woman uttered.

“You youngsters should get a taste of my stick too,” the old man said as he brandished his stick.

His sudden attack shocked them both. They never expected the old man to target them.

They had been watching all along, never stepping in even when he was teaching their disciples a lesson. How did they somehow piss off the old man?

Surprised as they were, they did not forget to defend themselves.

However…

“Thwack! Thwack!”

The old man used the stick to knock their weapons out of their hands and hit them without stopping. Their bodies sank downward with the force of his attacks. They continued to crash until they landed near the street.

The two of them appeared to be in a miserable condition.
