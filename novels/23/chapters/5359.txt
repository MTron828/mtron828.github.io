Chapter 5359 - 5359: Brother’s Aura

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Xia Mang Guanyu left, Jiang Shang, who was hiding behind Hu Qing, cautiously peeked out. In these years, she had grown quite a bit, blossoming into a somewhat reserved young woman.

“What’s wrong?” Hu Qing looked down at Jiang Shang, noticing a hint of fear in her eyes.

Jiang Shang shook her head, her eyes teary and sorrowful. “I sensed my brother’s aura on His Highness just now!”

As these words were uttered, Hu Qings expression changed. The bloody sacrifice from over a decade ago replayed in his mind.

The Wuliang Buddha was fine, unaffected by it.

The Crown Prince, upon hearing this, already aware of Jiang Shangs ordeal and knowing Hu Qings deep-seated resentment, said with a strange tone, “My ninth brother did go astray before, but he returned to the imperial city over a decade ago after completing his trial and has changed quite a bit. I hope he can walk the right path!’

“Virtuous!” Hu Qing clasped his hands together.

“Good!” Huiqing put her palms together.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang remained oblivious to this, leaving the imperial palace and returning to the mansion with his entourage.

Emperor-level formations were extremely rare, and now that Xuan Yuan Anshui wasn’t assisting him, he had to rely on himself.

The cost of an Emperor-level formation ranged in the hundreds of millions of godstones.

At the moment, he had less than two hundred million godstones on him, and he still needed to recruit more people. It was evidently a bit tight for him.

At this point, Bai Junwang spoke slowly, “Jian Wushuang, I just inquired with the people at the Heavenly Court Auction House. There are three or four

Emperor-level formations, and the only one with a lower starting bid is the Luo Hou Battle Formation, starting at three hundred million godstones!” “Luo Hou Formation!” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had considered buying an Emperor-level battle formation. Apart from whether he had the funds for the auction, even the weakest one required over a hundred Emperor-level experts.

He didn’t have enough.

Currently, there were no more than 50 of them.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was still short of 100.

Moreover, the weakened version of the Emperor-level formation required 10,000 Dao Lords.

The Luo Hou Formation, at its core, required at least nine tier 4 Emperors, 36 tier 3 emperors, and 72 tier 2 emperors.

Recruiting tier 2 and 3 Emperors was relatively easy, but for tier 4 Emperors, he had only recently recruited two, and there was still a significant gap.

Just as he was worrying, good news came from his two avatars.

The fusion of the Boundless Divine Body was successful.

The avatar located in Jian Qijin’s home was summoned by him.

Breaking through the divine body became much easier after the successful fusion, a considerable gain. If calculated carefully, from the 8,000-fold divine body to the 20,000-fold divine body, the treasures he saved were enough for a Grand Yan Immortal to break through to a 10,000-fold divine body.

This was a significant harvest.

After merging with the Boundless Divine Body, there was no need to keep the Infinite Ice Corpse. In the fiery gaze of Bai Junwang, Jian Wushuang hung the corpse at the Heavenly Court Auction House.

This time, he didn’t disguise his identity. Instead, he entered the Heavenly Court Auction House in a very high-profile manner.

According to the judgment of the Heavenly Court’s strong, the starting price for this Bouondless Ice Corpse was 500 million godstones.

It was beyond Jian Wushuangs expectations. He had thought that it would be sold for 300 million at most, but he did not expect the starting price to be 500 million.

Inside his body, Bai Junwang couldn’t help but feel a sense of regret. “What a

“What’s there to pity? As long as your origin source is restored, the divine spirit will prepare the best divine body and flesh for you!” The divine spirit had made it clear before that only he could refine Bai Junwangs origin source. The rest—the divine body and flesh—were insignificant to the divine spirit, like a drop in the ocean for a being that had lived for millions of years.

Even though it was 68,000-fold, the divine spirit had lived for billions of years, so why would they care about this?

Let’s not forget, once Bai Junwang recovered, his origin source would transcend the Four Great Secret Realms, possessing an intact origin source—something of immense value.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t know the details of the cooperation between Bai Junwang and the divine spirit, it was evident that the latter highly valued an intact origin source, going to great lengths from the pinnacle to his current state.

After dealing with the Boundess Ice Corpse, Jian Wushuangs true self directly entered seclusion within the royal mansion, claiming it was to avoid disturbances.

Because the clone inside the Xuanyuan Mansion had made a significant breakthrough.

The visitor was not Xuanyuan Ancheng but an elder of the Xuanyuan family, a tier 3 Emperor.

Though not exceptionally powerful, his seniority was remarkable, responsible for the growth of the younger generations in the family.

Therefore, he often accessed the treasury to retrieve valuable items.

On this day, Jian Wushuang waited patiently for a long time, fortunate that patience was one of his virtues.

“Should I kill him?” A murderous intent slowly rose in Jian Wushuangs heart.

If he killed the elder and then disguised himself as the elder, he could openly take away the treasures from here.

However, he was afraid that the array in this place would detect his actions.

He didn’t dare to take risks with a tier 6 Emperor-level array; seeking wealth in danger was one thing, but this was tantamount to courting death!

NO!

This was giving money away.

If he had honestly taken only godstones, he had a high chance of leaving with a massive amount of them.

However, if he resorted to force, his odds were only ten percent.

“Never mind!”

Jian Wushuang, now reduced to dust, drifted towards the ornate box the moment the secret room door opened.

The elder did not linger here for long. After selecting some treasures for mundane and Yan power use, he hastily departed.

At the instant he closed the door, Jian Wushuang transformed into a nimble hand, promptly opening the jade box and taking out the mustard seed within.

This entire process was completed in an instant. After securing the mustard seed, instead of turning into dust, he transformed into a godstone, neatly stacked on the godstone mountain.

Although the execution seemed flawless, the outside world was in turmoil.

Boom!

Xuanyuan Dapan burst out of the house, his figure like lightning, reaching the treasury in an instant.

Within the family, only he and his eldest son, Xuanyuan Ancheng, had array formations. Any slight disturbance in the grand array would be detected.

Just now, he clearly sensed a change in the family’s treasury. Though subtle, it had to be investigated.

Losing wealth was one thing, but losing it under his watchful eyes was a serious matter.

Once treasures were lost this time, the next to be lost would be heads.

Feeling it, Xuanyuan Ancheng also soared into the air and arrived before Xuanyuan Dapan.

“Elder Dajiang opened the treasury, and there was a change the moment he left!” Xuanyuan Ancheng immediately conveyed the information he obtained to his father, Xuanyuan Dapan.

Xuanyuan Dapan’s gaze was cold, his eyes flickering. In a low voice, he said,

“Go and see!”

He wanted to find out who had the audacity to infiltrate their family’s treasury.

That faint disturbance undoubtedly indicated someone’s presence. No matter how cautious, he could detect it.

“Also, thoroughly investigate Xuanyuan Dajiang. Leave no room for sentiment, scrutinize him from top to bottom!” Xuanyuan Dapan’s voice carried a hint of anger.

Xuanyuan Ancheng, who had intended to say something comforting, found his words stifled.

This matter touched a nerve with Xuanyuan Dapan.

In just a moment, several tier 4 Emperors within the clan appeared.

The second and third sons were training outside the city, and the fourth son was in seclusion. Currently, only the eldest son, Xuanyuan Ancheng, was by his father’s side. The other tier 4 Emperors were elders.
