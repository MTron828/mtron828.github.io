Chapter 1405: Rotation Battle!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

If the disciples had been in doubt of Jian Wushuang’s power and thought he wasn’t qualified to be a disciple of Star Palace, the doubts had definitely vanished after the battle between him and Luo Quan!

Since the very beginning, Jian Wushuang had never once made an explanation.

But he proved himself with absolute power on during the battle.

From that day on, in Lineage of Star, there wouldn’t be anyone who was in doubt of his ability as a disciple of Star Palace.

…

Then, the rotation battles continued.

Jian Wushuang returned outside Titanic Star and watched quietly as he recovered his Soul Power.

Very soon, his second rotation battle began.

“The next battle will be Jian Wushuang versus Xiao Yue,” the deacon elderly’s voice reverberated on Titanic Star.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Yue, who were both called upon, walked forward. The two of them stood opposite one another in the distance.

Xiao Yue was just an ordinary disciple and she was weaker in power compared to Luo Quan.

If there wasn’t any accident during the battle, there wouldn’t be any suspense.

“Jian Wushuang, perform the trick that you used on Luo Quan,” Xiao Yue looked solemn as she stared at Jian Wushuang.

Although she was extremely astonished by the sight of Jian Wushuang defeating Luo Quan, the phantasm that Jian Wushuang performed instilled fear in Xiao Yue.

However, she was afraid of Jian Wushuang’s phantasm only. As for the other attacks, she believed that Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be her match.

“As long as I can endure his phantasmagoria images and shake off his dreamland, I will win the battle!” Xiao Yue clenched her fists.

When Jian Wushuang heard her, he shook his head and said, “I don’t need to pull that trick when I’m against you.”

“Are you humiliating me?” Xiao Yue got furious, “Let’s see what you have!”

Swoosh!

Xiao Yue took action directly. She had a purple longspear in her hand. The moment the purple longspear appeared, there was an explosion of huge power immediately. Swoosh! The longspear turned into a bunch of crimson-purple rays. It pierced the void and appeared before Jian Wushuang.

It had yet to reach Jian Wushuang and he could feel the terrifying, spiraling force that the tip of the long spear had brought about.

Jian Wushuang didn’t look like he had moved much, but just as the purple longspear was about to stab his body, vroom, a vast expanse of Soul Power suddenly soared and immediately formed into a huge black tortoise on the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body.

The purple longspear stabbed the black tortoiseshell and there was a loud clash, but it didn’t move an inch.

“What?” Xiao Yue was shocked.

Just then, Jian Wushuang saw a ray of sharp light.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Three roars were heard simultaneously. Suddenly, three huge demonic dragons transformed from the billowing Soul Power on Titanic Star.

The three demonic dragons were pitch-black and they gave out fierce aura. It was as though they came from a borderless hell and they flew out like lightning.

The three demonic dragons charged towards Xiao Yue in unison. The strong, imposing aura that the demonic dragons brought along frightened Xiao Yue.

She could feel that with one of the dragons would be extremely difficult to fight off, let alone the fact that there were three in total then.

“Go away!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xiao Yue screamed and wielded the purple longspear in her hand. The eruption of her divine power suddenly became three strikes of lightning. They suddenly flew at the skulls of three demonic dragons.

However, the three demonic dragons were moving flexibly in the void and they dodged Xiao Yue’s long spear easily.

“They are so flexible.”

Xiao Yue was terrified. The very next moment, the three demonic dragons appeared next to her and started tearing at her. Xiao Yue didn’t endure long before she was defeated.

In the boundless Milky Way, the deacon elderlies laughed at the sight.

“Just as we expected, Jian Wushuang didn’t give his all in the Supreme Tower.”

“Yeah. For instance, he only put one demonic dragon into play when he was in Supreme Tower. The demonic dragon could barely be evenly matched with an ordinary advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven. He put three dragons to play at one goal and it is only natural that Xiao Yue couldn’t fight against them.”

“Xiao Yue intended to make Jian Wushuang perform the phantasmagoria trick that he use against Luo Quan. But, in the end, Jian Wushuang defeated her with just his consciousness manipulation method alone.”

Jian Wushuang defeated Xiao Yue and it was within everyone’s expectations. Everyone accepted the result easily.

But their fight still shocked many disciples.

However, when he fought against Xiao Yue, he didn’t even use any secret skills. He won merely with the manipulation of consciousness. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang knew more than just pulling one into dreamland.

The rotation battles were rather ferocious.

Everyone had to go through nine battles.

At the beginning, Jian Wushuan only fought against ordinary disciples like Luo Quan and Xiao Yue. They were hardly any troubler for Jian Wushuang. However, his third opponent was a disciple of Star Palace.

“The next battle will be Jian Wushuang versus Xia Feng!”

On Titanic Star, Jian Wushuang and Xia Feng stood opposite one another.

Xiao Feng was in a crimson robe. Although he looked young, he had silver-white hair.

Then, Xia Feng looked at Jian Wushuang, “I heard that you gave my people a lesson on Tai Yuan Star?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded , making no attempt at denial.

“Those were just servants. I had nothing to do with them. They behaved wrongly, and you, as a disciple of Star Palace, took action to give them a lesson. It is only right and proper. I don’t mind. However, I will not let you win against me in today’s fight,” Xia Feng said.

“Then we shall see if you have the power to,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly.

“I’ll let you know,” Xia Feng smiled, “Jian Wushuang, I know your consciousness attack is very powerful, especially your dreamland. However, I am different from Luo Quan and Xiao Yue. They are only ordinary disciples. They never once had a chance to enter Reset Palace to train their consciousness. But I trained for a very long time in Reset Palace. My consciousness strength already reached the level of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven. I am only one step away from a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. Can your dreamland do anything to me?”

“There’s only one way to find out,” Jian Wushuang didn’t say much but flipped his palm and Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

Xia Feng too took out his divine weapon. It was a pair of gold shackles that looked extremely heavy and the aura it gave out was rather fierce too.

“It begins.”

Xia Feng smiled and in the next moment his body shook and he plunged towards Jian Wushuang at a ghostly speed.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were like blazing fires. The moment he saw Xia Feng move, vast Soul Power swept out and suddenly transformed into three huge demonic dragons again.
