Chapter 2152 Victory!

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and he looked towards Kaiser Blood.Kaiser Blood looked towards Jian Wushuang in a peculiar way.

“Jian Wushuang, you have destroyed the Three Emperors World’s plans several times. I remember you now.”

“Wait and see, I’ll give you a surprise the next time we meet.”

“Haha~~”

A burst of devious laughter echoed around, and Kaiser Blood’s figured faded into nothing in front of all the Eternal Chaotic World experts.

The blood-coloured sea that had filled the entire Imperial City gradually disappeared as well.

The Imperial City went quiet once again.

With that, the final battle came to an end. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Unfortunately, there was no decisive victory on both sides.

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, and others gathered above the Void.

“Are you alright guys?” Emperor Bai looked at the Great Emperors in front of him.

The Great Emperors in front of him were those that had followed Jian Wushuang in the sneak attack.

“We’re fine, but Black Dragon Emperor was hit badly by one Three Emperors World Great Emperor,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked towards Black Dragon Emperor and found her rather pale in complexion, and her aura had been weakened significantly as well. He frowned.

“I’m fine, I’ll recover over time,” Black Dragon Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

At this time, Ancestor Tian Chen walked over.

“Emperor Bai, the casualties on both sides have been tallied,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

The crowd looked at Ancestor Tian Chen.

“How is it?” Emperor Bai asked.

“We lost a lot of Sir Gods and Emperor Gods, over two hundred of them in total, with more injured. Luckily they had elixirs to recover their injuries and divine powers immediately, if not, we would have suffered greater losses. We only have three injured Great Emperors thankfully,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

The faces of Jian Wushuang and the others darkened.

The battle had been completely to their advantage, but they’d still lost so many Almighties?

“What about the Three Emperors World forces?” Emperor Bai asked indifferently.

Ancestor Tian Chen straightened himself, and replied in excitement, “Preliminary statistics showed that with the treasures like Heaven Piercing Arrows, Blood Thunder Pearl on our side, we took down eight Great Emperors alone!”

“Coupling the Sword Emperor’s sneak attack, the Three Emperors World lost twelve Great Emperors!”

Everyone flinched upon hearing the numbers.

Twelve Great Emperors?

Before the Eternal Chaotic World had started the great battle, there had only been thirteen allied Great Emperors known by the Sanctuary Alliance!

It was only as the battle began that the hidden experts revealed themselves, increasing Sanctuary Alliance’s total of Great Emperors.

Taking down twelve Great Emperors in one blow must have been a devastating blow to the Three Emperors World.

“The enemy lost even more Sir Gods and Emperor Gods.”

Ancestor Tian Chen said with excitement. “The main factor leading to such great numbers is naturally Jian Wushuang’s achievement, taking down over a thousand Almighties. Add that to the Almighties taken down by our army, and it means the enemy has lost over 1,500 Sir Gods and Emperor Gods!”

1,500 Almighties…

The Great Emperors around were all shocked.

Especially Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, and King Chen Xing.

They had not considered how many they had slaughtered during the fight.

Now, they realised how many people had fallen at their blades.

They were not surprised, nor did they feel guilty about it.

After all, the Sir Gods and Emperor Gods they had slaughtered were considered weak to them. In fact, a lot of them were innocent – they did not know a war was going on between both worlds.

Slaughtering such Almighties brought them no pride or joy at all.

But they had no choice.

For the Eternal Chaotic World and the billions of beings living in it, they had to do it.

They had no guilt.

“It’s a pity Kaiser Blood appeared at the last minute, allowing the rest to escape so easily, abandoning the entire Imperial City. If not, we could have achieved better results,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

Jian Wushuang and others nodded.

Kaiser Blood was very decisive.

Imperial City was the sanctuary grounds of the Three Emperors World, possessing huge resources and sites of opportunity. Countless Three Emperors World experts had been stationed there for too long.

It was the Three Emperors World’s lair.

But when Kaiser Blood saw the situation in front of him, he made the decisive decision to forgo the lair to protect the experts.

This kind of decisiveness was not one that an average man possessed.

“We were not able to take down all Three Emperors World experts, but their losses are definitely much worse than ours!” Emperor Bai said. “Regardless, this is definitely the Eternal Chaotic World’s victory!”

“Yes, a victory!”

“Complete victory!”

The Great Emperors around all held hands in excitement.

Even though they paid the high price of two hundred Almighties, they took down 1,500 enemy Almighties and twelve Great Emperors. This degree of victory was unprecedented.

“Our forces were of equal footing with the enemy before this battle. But now, after today, the scales of victory have completely landed on our side!”
