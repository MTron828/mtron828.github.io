4686 The Prisoner

Jian Wushuang shook his dizzy head and started to observe the prisoners who were in the same situation as him.

What he saw shocked him. None of the prisoners were lower than Half Ancestors!

What kind of concept was that? Even in the most brutal Great Catastrophe War, there were no more than 30 Half Ancestors in the Divine Power Universe and the Void Universe, and some of them were Devourers.

But now, the lowest rank of these prisoners was actually Half Ancestor?

100,000 Half Ancestors? Even with Jian Wushuang’s composure, he was completely shocked.

Could this be the specialty of the Great Yan Domain?

Even the prisoner’s realm had reached such a level. Jian Wushuang did not dare to imagine what other terrifying existences there were in the Great Yan Domain.

After taking a deep breath and suppressing his shock, Jian Wushuang looked at the black mountain closest to him.

There were more than 100,000 prisoners in total, and they were directly divided into 10 teams. The teams were in the units of tens of thousands people, and they were like long dragons that marched into different black mountains.

Jian Wushuang’s team entered the largest black mountain.

Just as he was about to enter the huge mine, he saw hundreds of black-robed figures walking around.

For some reason, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of deja vu when he saw them.

However, before he could take a closer look, the prisoners behind him pushed him forward.

After entering the deep tunnel, it was not as dark as he had imagined. Instead, a hazy purple light illuminated the entire tunnel, making it look like a dream.

Jian Wushuang noticed that the hazy purple light was coming from a type of purple sand that was distributed in the mine.

As the team went deeper, this team of more than 10,000 seemed extremely small in the deep belly of the black mountain.

At the same time, hundreds of black-robed warden divided the team into more than a hundred teams.

Jian Wushuang’s team of 100 people entered the widest mine tunnel under the guard’s lead.

“What a coincidence. You’ve just arrived here, and you’re about to die.” The slim figure who was walking beside him had a flash of mockery in his eyes. “Prepare well.”

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to speak, a huge black whip lashed at the thin figure, causing him to groan and blood to ooze out of his chest.

The black-robed warden at the front of the group turned around and gave Jian Wushuang a cold look before continuing on.

Looking at the Half Ancestor level warden, Jian Wushuang was expressionless. He then turned his head and asked in a low voice, “What did you mean by what you said just now?”

“Bait,” After Jian Wushuang repeated this several times in his heart, he could vaguely guess what was going to happen next.

The mine tunnel became hotter and hotter the further he went. When he reached the end, Jian Wushuang was surprised to see that the heart of the mountain was empty.

Countless huge black vines that looked like stone sculptures covered the stone walls, as if they could wake up at any time.

At the same time, the stone walls surrounding these pitch-black vines were covered with countless special purple crystals.

The black-robed warden standing at the front slowly turned around and looked at the 100-man team.

“Jump down,” he said in a deep voice.

However, no one stepped forward.

The black-robed warden seemed to have anticipated this situation. He waved his black bone whip and swept up nearly 20 people, throwing them into the abyss.

In the next moment, the most shocking scene appeared. The pitch-black vines that were attached to the stone wall slowly woke up. Like giant pythons, they directly wrapped up the prisoners who fell into the abyss and stuffed them into the unknown darkness.

All the prisoners who saw this scene subconsciously stepped back, shaking all over.

However, the black-robed warden laughed coldly. As he retreated, he used a vast amount of Yan power to block all the exits.

At the same time, a giant python-like vine quietly appeared in front of the prisoners.

Boom boom boom!

The pitch-black vines suddenly reached forward and directly swept away more than half of the prisoners.

Jian Wushuang furrowed his eyebrows. There was no way to retreat as the abyss was right under his feet!

The thin figure beside him glanced at Jian Wushuang and then jumped onto the black vine that was hanging in the air.

The rest of the prisoners followed closely, gritting their teeth and jumping up.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and jumped as well. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

His foot was as hard as a rock, and with a little force, the gravel fell.

“This thing is actually a living thing…” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and began to think about how to escape.

The injuries he had suffered in the space-time turbulence had long recovered, and at the same time, the Yan power in his body had reached its peak.

However, the chain iron plate on his neck was like the Laws of the Great Dao, restricting all the Yan power in his meridians.

Jian Wushuang’s strength could hardly reach the ancestor level.

The only thing he was relieved about was that he could still use his Sword Intent and Ancestral Skills, so he had no problem protecting himself for the time being.

Running between the vines was no less dangerous than before.

Each of the vines, which could easily destroy a Half Ancestor, waved wildly like tentacles.

However, in just a few exchanges, there were less than 10 people in the group of nearly 200 prisoners.

“Hang in there. As long as we can hold on until the others enter the pit, we can live!” A thin figure suddenly appeared beside Jian Wushuang and reminded him in a deep voice, “Follow me and I’ll make sure you don’t die!”

Jian Wushuang laughed quietly and said, “Let’s save our own lives first before we talk about other things.”

“You don’t believe me?” The skinny man’s eyes narrowed.

Jian Wushuang continued, “Of course I believe you, but no one can save themselves here, right?”

The slim figure did not say anything. After taking a look at Jian Wushuang, he disappeared into the vines like a ghost.

Jian Wushuang focused on avoiding the attacks of the vines.

When the last scream came to an abrupt end, only two people were left alive above the entire abyss.

One of them was Jian Wushuang, and the other was the thin figure.

Although Jian Wushuang could not tell this guy’s cultivation realm in this situation, Jian Wushuang could vaguely feel that the thin figure was not an ordinary Half Ancestor.

The two of them looked at each other from a distance and then nodded tacitly. Jian Wushuang then asked, “How long do you want to hold on?”

The thin figure slowly raised a finger.

“A day?”

“No, it’s a year.”

“What? A year?”

“Of course not.” The slim man smiled weirdly. “Only after the big guy is full and falls asleep will they let the other teams mine. That will be the best time for us to escape!”
