Chapter 2531: Following You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Above a vast void in Dark Thunder Territory.

Although Jian Wushuang was slowly gliding forward his mind kept replaying the battle with the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor.

‘Sword World. Now, that’s a real complete Sword World!’

The kind of stunning effects against sword principles and sword-based techniques not to forget the sword essences which filled every corner of Heaven and Earth...’

Jian Wushuang sank into deep thoughts and only got out from his stupor after a very long time.

Phew!

Jian Wushuang exhaled lightly with a faint smile on his face.

“The battle with the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was not victorious, but I had gained a whole lot through and through.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, “The Governor is truly very powerful, but he can only easily suppress me due to his Sword World’s stunning effects. If I’m against other Peak Ultimate God who has opened his own World, my sword principles won’t suffer such suppression so long it was not a Sword World and I won’t end up in such a miserable state.”

A sword cultivator who formed his Sword World and one who did not were two different concepts.

Furthermore, a cultivator who had formed his Sword World would have a bigger shock and suppression impact against other sword cultivators.

If the opponent cultivated other principles such as blade principles, the effect would not be as apparent.

Jian Wushuang had truly suffered a lot under the Governor’s Sword World.

“I’ve now personally experienced his Sword World. Once I’ve formed my own Sword World and encounter the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor again, it’ll no longer be such an easy win with both our Sword Worlds suppressing against each other.”

Jian Wushuang was really looking forward to forming his own Sword World.

However, he also knew forming a Sword World was not something he could do as he wished. Even for him, he would need time to gradually study and understand how it works.

Jian Wushuang met up with Xiao Tiexin half a day after he left the Central Region.

“Mr. Jian Yi, did you run into any troubles along the way?” Xiao Tiexin asked curiously.

“A little bit. I had a battle with the Luo Brothers and the Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture,” said Jian Wushuang.

“The Luo Brothers? The Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture?” Xiao Tiexin was shocked.

It was believable that he fought the Luo Brothers, but the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was considered the number one expert in the Eighteen Prefectures.

“What is the outcome?” Xiao Tiexin continued to ask.

“I suffered a small defeat, but they couldn’t force me to stay.” Jian Wushuang smiled and did not explain too much. “The remaining fifteen prefectures are frantically looking for me now, I don’t think I can stay in this territory anymore. Let’s go to Northern Darkstar Continent.”

“Mmhm.” Xiao Tiexin nodded.

They immediately took off.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin naturally sped up upon leaving the Central Region for their remaining journey as regular thieves could not pose any threats so long those Fifteen Prefecture experts did not come after them.

They arrived at the border of Dark Thunder Territory a month later.

“Let’s stop here,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Mr. Jian Yi?” Xiao Tiexin took a glance at Jian Wushuang and now knew what he intended to do.

Jian Wushuang had obtained a big amount of resources and treasures from destroying the Demonic Moon, Heaven Poison, and Underworld Prefectures. Close to 90,000 Primordial Stones to be exact.

During that whole time, Jian Wushuang did not have time to refine and absorb those Primordial Stones.

However, at that moment...

“As soon as we leave Dark Thunder Territory, we would be in the Northern Darkstar Continent. I should refine those Primordial Stones before entering the Northern Darkstar Continent. Even though it won’t allow me to make further breakthroughs, an increase of divine powers will still upgrade my abilities to an extent,” said Jian Wushuang.

He very soon found a quiet place, sat down cross-legged, and began refining those stones.

As for Xiao Tiexin, she was still assisting him as before.

There were only 6,000 Primordial Stones last time and Jian Wushuang needed only two days to finish refining them.

However, there were 90,000 pieces now and Jian Wushuang needed an entire month to refine all of them.

Jian Wushuang stood up and looked at those Primordial Stones which had turned into regular stone piles around him and exclaimed, “It only took a month to finish all ninety thousand of them, my absorption speed is beyond overly-luxurious.”

The 90,000 pieces of Primordial Stones were the three prefectures of Dark Thunder Territory’s accumulation and Jian Wushuang had just exhausted it like that.

If others knew about it, they would probably be dead envious.

Xiao Tiexin walked over at that moment.

Xiao Tiexin was shocked as well upon looking at those rocks on the ground. She then asked, “Mr. Jian Yi, since you have absorbed close to 90,000 Primordial Stones, does that mean your divine power is...”

Jian Wushuang laughed. “It’s not as simple as you think. These ninety thousand Primordial Stones may upgrade my divine powers by a lot, but there’s still a slight gap before I could make a breakthrough to the next cultivation level.”

“A slight gap?” Xiao Tiexin was shocked as those 90,000 Primordial Stones were the equivalent of unfathomable divine powers and yet Jian Wushuang still could not make a breakthrough to the next level?

“Just a little bit.” Jian Wushuang sighed as well.

His divine powers at that time could be considered at the very top of a First-Class Divine Demon and infinitely close to the Peak Divine Demon realm.

According to Jian Wushuang’s estimation, he would just have to refine another 20,000 to 30,000 Primordial Stones if he wished to make a breakthrough into the Peak Divine Demon realm.

That figure was not considered too big for him who had just refined 90,000 Primordial Stones. The problem was that he could not find so many Primordial Stones at this moment.

He had exhausted all of his Primordial Stones and there were only a huge number of resources and treasures left which he could not refine like Primordial Stones.

Although, Xiao Tiexin still possessed 6,000 pieces of Primordial Stones that were not remotely enough. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Forget it, I’ll go to the North Darkstar Continent first and think of a way there,” mumbled Jian Wushuang before looking over at Xiao Tiexin. “Tiexin, where are you planning to go after leaving Dark Thunder Territory?”

“Nowhere, I’ll just follow you,” said Xiao Tiexin straightforwardly.

“Following me?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“I have a feeling I’ll gain some benefits if I’m with you,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Oh, but why?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“I’m not sure, perhaps because of your terrifying abilities, talent, or advancement speed. I’ve never heard anyone refining Primordial Stones as recklessly as you do. If you could keep progressing in this manner, perhaps you would become a pinnacle existence within the Northern Darkstar Continent. In the end, you could even become...”

Xiao Tiexin suddenly paused with a peculiar look on her face.
