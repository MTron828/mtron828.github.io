Chapter 2422: Extremely Sure

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

One’s reputation grows correlatively to the shadow of the tree.1

The name of the Twelve Minor Kings was incomparable to ordinary geniuses.

“Are you Zhong Yi?”

Pang Tao glanced at Zhong Yi. “I’ve heard about you. Among the younger disciples of Wusha Wilderness, apart from the Twelve Minor Kings, there are also a few more capable cultivators. You are one of them, but it’s a pity that I am not here to see you today.”

“In that case, who are you looking for?” Zhong Yi stared at Pang Tao alertly.

Pang Tao grinned evilly as his eyes swept across the other Narcissus Island disciples, observing them one at a time.

All the disciples who met his gaze lowered their heads and no one dared to look directly at Pang Tao.

These Narcissus Island core disciples were self-acclaimed geniuses. They were indeed talented to a certain extent. However, many geniuses had gathered in the Saint’s Tomb. Their powers were a far cry compared to Pang Tao from the Great Compassion Sect who ranked sixth among the Twelve Minor Kings.

Pang Tao could not be bothered about those disciples either.

He looked around and finally locked his eyes on Jian Wushuang who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.

“He is the one I’m looking for!”

Pang Tao pointed directly at Jian Wushuang. His gaze became extremely sharp, and his aura completely enshrouded Jian Wushuang. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Narcissus Island disciples, including Zhong Yi, were startled to see Pang Tao pointing towards Jian Wushuang.

‘Has Pang Tao already known that Junior Brother Wushuang broke through the eighth trial bridge?’

That cannot be. We didn’t spread the news and no one saw Junior Brother Wushuang completed the test besides us. How did he find out?’

Zhong Yi frowned.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang who was enveloped in Pang Tao’s aura recovered his attention.

He opened his eyes and slowly stood up.

Under the overbearing aura pressure of Pang Tao’s First-Class Divine Demon, Jian Wushuang remained calm and expressionless. He turned his head to look at Pang Tao and smiled faintly. “You must be a friend from the Great Compassion Sect, Brother Pang Tao who is ranked sixth among the Twelve Minor Kings, right? I wonder why you are looking for me?”

Jian Wushuang sounded polite.

He even addressed Pang Tao humbly as a senior brother though they were from different sects.

“Senior Brother? You really know how to cotton up to me. You must be Jian Wushuang. I know you.” Pang Tao stared at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s an honor to be known by Senior Brother Pang Tao.” Jian Wushuang was still acting humbly.

“Jian Wushuang, I won’t waste time talking nonsense with you. I know that you are the one who passed the test of the eighth trial bridge. The Purple Blood Saint’s inheritance is now in your hands. I will leave now as long as you hand over the Purple Blood Saint’s inheritance to me. Otherwise...” Pang Tao’s voice was cold.

His words immediately sent the surrounding void into chaos.

There were quite a number of talented disciples from various sects surrounding him.

Previously, those disciples had no idea what Pang Tao wanted to do with Jian Wushuang, but they now realized his intention.

Pang Tao was there for the Purple Blood Saint’s inheritance.

They were puzzled as Jian Wushuang did not look like someone who was able to complete the test on the eighth trial bridge.

“If I’m not mistaken, isn’t Jian Wushuang just a Chaotic Realm?”

“Yes, he is a Chaotic Realm. I noticed him when I was in the outer areas of Saint’s Tomb. The weakest genius of all the sects this time who entered the tomb was at least a Second-Class Divine Demon. He is the only one in the Chaotic Realm.”

“Did Pang Tao just say that this Chaotic Realm passed the test of the eighth trial bridge? Are you kidding me?”

“I don’t think it is possible. He is just a Chaotic Realm anyway. Even if he is highly talented, he could not possibly have a good sword principles understanding. How could he possibly pass the trial bridge which countless sword skill geniuses failed to pass? Moreover, I’ve never heard of Jian Wushuang. I would never believe that an unknown Chaotic Realm had just passed the test!”

Everyone around was busy gossiping about what they saw.

It turned out that 99 percent or perhaps a hundred percent of them did not believe that Jian Wushuang passed the test.

Some people even thought that Pang Tao was probably looking for trouble with Narcissus Island, so he deliberately made the claim.

Unlike the genius disciples of various sects, Narcissus Island core disciples trembled when they heard what Pang Tao said.

They did not expect that Pang Tao would turn up and insist that Jian Wushuang was the person who had crossed the eighth trial bridge despite no one spreading the news. Where did he get the news? Why was he so sure?

“Pang Tao, what are you talking about? Which trial bridge’s test? Did you say that the test of the eighth trial bridge that has stumped countless sword skill geniuses in Wusha Wilderness was passed by Junior Brother Wushuang? “Zhong Yi was calm and even sarcastically smiled.

“The test of the eighth trial bridge is extremely tough. My Junior Brother Wushuang is indeed gifted with the sword, but he is only a Chaotic Realm. I might as well tell you that he is just an outer disciple of Narcissus Island. He is particularly close to Elder Wujian, hence Elder Wujian sent him along with us to this tomb so that he can gain knowledge. Isn’t it funny if you claim that he is the one who passed the test of the eighth trial bridge?”

Haha, Pang Tao. What wild assumptions you have.”

Zhong Yi did not hide his sneer.

The genius disciples of various sects around gave Pang Tao the derisive look.

Obviously, no one believed Pang Tao’s claim.

It was unreasonable for a Chaotic Realm and a Narcissus Island outer disciple to have passed the challenging test.

Jian Wushuang made his way to Zhong Yi’s side, but he remained expressionless.

Pang Tao stared down at Jian Wushuang and suddenly grinned. “Huh, did I really just make a wild guess? Or is it true? Jian Wushuang, don’t think that you can hide away just because you are only a Chaotic Realm and an outer disciple of Narcissus Island. Indeed, no one from the other sects will ever doubt that it was you. That’s why no one was able to hunt you down after so many days.”

But I’m different!”

Jian Wushuang, I’ve heard of you a long time ago. I know who you are. Don’t forget that I’m not merely the Great Compassion Sect core disciple. Most importantly, I have a master, and he’s the top sword Cultivator of the Wusha Wilderness—Fan Jianxian!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that. He was helpless.

He finally knew why Pang Tao was extremely sure that he was the one who passed the test.
