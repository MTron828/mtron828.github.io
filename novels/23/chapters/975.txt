“Whom do you want to ask about?” asked Xue Lingtian.

“Master Ku,” replied Jian Wushuang. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Master Ku?” Xue Lingtian was surprised. “Why do you want to ask about him?”

“To be honest, I killed his Senior Brother two days ago, and now he’s coming to kill me,” Jian Wushuang forced a smile and said.

“I see.” Xue Lingtian lowered his head and then continued in a serious tone, “I’ve heard about Master Ku’s Senior Brother. His name is Gu Ji Dao Master.

“He and Master Ku are indeed from the same sect. Their sect was destroyed a long time ago, and they were the only survivors. Both of them were lucky and quickly became Dao Masters after that. However, I heard that they parted on rather bad terms for some unknown reason a long time ago. They haven’t talked to each other for years. Given this, only a few people know that they’re from the same sect.

“But despite everything, they’re still brothers from the same sect. No wonder he’s after you now.

“You’ve got to be careful, my brother.

“This old dude is kind of a weirdo who does whatever he wants. Although he and I are both Void Temple Masters and we’ve met each other a couple times before, we’re in no way close. He’s very temperamental. He won’t let you off easily because of me, even if he knows that you’re my Junior Brother.

“And this guy is powerful too. He’s especially good at close combat. He’s easily the second best of the Eighteeen Masters of the Void Templ. Even I would have a hard time defeating him, so don’t let him get close to you.”

“Good at close combat?” Jian Wushuang frowned and continued, “Thanks for the tip, bro.”

“You’re welcome. I’m sure you’ll be able to resist him, but be careful.” Xue Lingtian warned him again.

“I will.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then disrupted the communication.

“Jian Wushuang, what did your brother say?” Emperor Xiao turned to look at Jian Wushuang and asked. The other experts also shifted their gazes toward Jian Wushuang.

“It’s alright. Let’s go to meet this Master Ku,” Jian Wushuang replied smilingly.

With these words, he hurtled himself out of the Imperial Palace. The others followed suit.

The moment they came out of the Formation, Jian Wushuang saw a person standing in the void in front of him.

It was a good-looking middle-aged man, but he had silver hair like an elder.

What was most noticeable about him was his sharp and piercing eyes.

“So this is Master Ku.”?Jian Wushuang thought, feeling impressed by the man’s unique aura.

He discovered that the aura of this man was somewhat similar to that of his Master Xuan Yi except that Xuan Yi looked more aloof from the world.

Even this Master Ku would be blown away by that cool aloofness.

“Master Ku.” Jian Wushuang bowed, his voice modest.

“So you’re Jian Wushuang?”

Master Ku turned his gaze toward Jian Wushuang. He fixed his eyes on Wushuang as if he could see through the young man.

“Gu Ji is my Senior Brother. He did some shitty things and deserved to die. But he didn’t deserve to be killed by you, a boy who’s less than 2,000 years old,” said Master Ku, somewhat grumpily.

“Master Ku, my father-in-law is the emperor of Tang of the East and your Senior Brother Gu Ji Dao Master was assisting the three big countries that were trying to destroy Tang of the East. When he came to challenge us, I accepted the challenge and killed him during the duel. This is just part of a battle between us and the three big countries. Please forgive my bluntness, Master Ku. You’re one of the 18 Void Temple Masters. I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to get involved in this thing,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Humph! This has nothing to do with the Void Temple. This is something personal. I’m not interested in your battle against some invaders. As you killed my brother, I have to kill you to avenge his death. But since you’re much younger than me, I’m not going to be too hard on you.

“Fifteen minutes. If you can manage to resist me for 15 minutes, I’ll leave you alone and never speak of revenge again,” Master Ku snorted and said.

“That’s interesting,” said Jian Wushuang.

He could see that Master Ku did not have much feeling for his Senior Brother.?“He probably just comes here to fight me because of his duty as a Junior Brother, and he doesn’t care much about whether he can kill me in the end.

“Otherwise, why did he give me this chance? If he really wants to avenge the death of his brother, he can come at me directly to kill me,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Deal, fifteen minutes.” Jian Wushuang laughed a hearty laugh, “After you, Master Ku.”

Jian Wushuang sounded polite but he was ready for battle.

He was much more powerful than before. He had recently broken through to the Three-star Ancient God level, and the newly-gained Blood-killing Plate Armor had also enhanced his battle strength.

He guessed that his current battle strength was nearly as strong as that of a Dao Master, but he was not entirely sure of it. He would never know how strong he was unless he fought a battle with his full strength.

Now, this Master Ku came along.

He happened to be a well-matched opponent for Jian Wushuang. After fighting this Master Ku, Jian Wushuang would be albe to know more about his own strength.

“Let’s get started!” Jian Wushuang shouted, excitement flickering within his eyes.

“Humph!”

Master Ku snorted in contempt again. He flipped his hands to summon a pair of sabers.

“Two sabers?”?Jian Wushuang was startled.

Many experts of the Green Fire World used sabers, such as Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother Xu Lingtian.

Nevertheless, very few of them used twin sabers.

“Prepare to die! Jian Wushuang.”

Master Ku bellowed, as he dashed forward.

“Swoosh!”

Master Ku transformed himself into a saber and split the Void. In the blink of an eye, he got close to Jian Wushuang and swung his twin sabers at the young man.

“That was fast!”

Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

Master Ku was indeed fast. He must be one of the strongest Rank Three Dao Masters.

Not everyone could wield two sabers at the same time with such speed and ferocity.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned red. He quickly summoned his Blood Mountain Sword and channelled his Ancient God Power into his hand and then into the sword.

“Clang! Clang!”

The twin sabers and the sword clashed together. Jian Wushuang found it hard to resist the pressure exerted by Master Ku and could not help bending pressed down a lot.
