2239 Left in Hatred

“Scaly!”

“My Scaly!” The eerie man was trembling, his face all twisted.

Dead!

His dragon had been accompanying him since the Ancient Era. It had fought alongside him and survived the Ancient Era battles, he was like a brother to him.

It did not die in the insane Ancient Era battles but had died in Emperor Bai’s hands.

The eerie man had completely lost it.

“Emperor Bai!” Emperor Bai!

The eerie man glared at Emperor Bai with his bloodshot eyes. The hatred in his eyes was earth-shocking.

“I’ll remember today!”

“Not for long, I’ll make sure you’ll pay for this, tenfold, a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold!”

“You just wait.”

His wailing roar resonated across the land, and the frenzy within the roar did not seem to fade away.

After saying that, the eerie man escaped. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As he watched the eerie man leave, Emperor Bai frowned but had no intention of chasing him.

Not because he did not want to, but because the enemy had already used a secret skill to escape. He was too fast for Emperor Bai to catch and kill.

Xiu!

A figure appeared beside Emperor Bai – it was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took quite some time rushing over from his own domain. By the time he reached it, he only managed to catch a glimpse of that eerie man escaping with hatred in his heart.

Jian Wushuang took a glance at that eerie man, then looked over towards Emperor Bai.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze shifted.

He noticed the 9,900 thousand feet tall golden emperor behind Emperor Bai.

The golden emperor’s aura was one even he dared not underestimate.

“Emperor Bai, this is... a secret skill?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“It is.” Emperor Bai nodded. As he retracted his aura, the golden emperor gradually faded into nothing as well. “It’s called the Punisher God, I learnt it in the First Era. Unfortunately, I did not receive the entire secret skill and could not perform its full power until Emperor Thirteen passed it to me.”

“Impressive,” Jian Wushuang was impressed.

Emperor Bai was already very impressive with his Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step Divine Powers, along with his Rules of Order, making him the strongest amongst Great Emperors. With the Nine Star Armour and Punisher God, he was almost Divine Demon powers.

“Why, envious?” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang interestingly.

“A bit,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Regardless of the Nine Star Armour or Punisher God, they were all Ancient Era secret skills and Emperor Bai had them both. Of course, Jian Wushuang was envious.

“You envy me? I envy you,” Emperor Bai laughed. “Your Inverse Cultivation gives you a great advantage over others, along with your perfect Ancient God Clan bloodline. Your secret skill of body refinery is very terrifying as well. In terms of Divine Power, holy body, you are stronger than me, with many tricks up my sleeve, maybe even stronger than my two secret skills.”

Indeed, Emperor Bai had his advantages.

Jian Wushuang had his as well. The Mountain River Map and Soul Swallowing Pearl alone were enough to make Emperor Bai envious.

“I put in a lot of effort into these two secret skills. The Nine Star Armour is easier to learn with enough time and especially resources. After the Eternal Chaotic World stabilises, I’ll pass it to you.”

“For the Punisher God, the cultivating requirements are too harsh. I managed to learn it due to pure luck, even though you’re more gifted, you won’t be able to learn it in the current Eternal Chaotic World,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders.

He knew they were tough to learn, but he had no intention of learning it from the very beginning. Emperor Bai was overthinking.

But at that moment...

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Five figures appeared at the same time, they were Jian Er, Jian Yi, Red Dragon King, Abysmal Saint Master, and Underworld God who had rushed from the other domain.

They saw the rubble of what was the Divine Blade City, and felt some remnants of power in the nearby Void. They were stunned.

“Lord Emperor Bai, Sword Emperor, how was it?”

“Where’s the Black Water Dragon?” the Red Dragon King asked.

“The Black Water Dragon died by my hand, but I only managed to injure the Ancient Era expert behind it. He took a great sense of hatred when he left, he will try to have his revenge soon enough,” Emperor Bai said.

Red Dragon King, Abysmal Saint Master and the others were elated when they heard the Black Water Dragon was dead.

As for revenge...

“Haha, revenge?”

“Getting revenge against Emperor Bai in this era? Ridiculous.”

Red Dragon King sniggered. He was absolutely confident in Emperor Bai’s abilities.

“Indeed, revenge against Emperor Bai is a death wish,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“I’m not afraid of revenge. Even though these Ancient Era experts were good, as long as they are not as powerful as Emperor Thirteen or Blood Emperor, or make up some other kind of Opposing Blood Formation, no one can stop me. I’m afraid he’ll take his revenge on the Eternal Chaotic World and Sanctuary Alliance instead,” Emperor Bai frowned.

“He is an Ancient Era expert after all. No one can stop him except Emperor Bai and me. If he is determined to get his revenge, it will get messy,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The Sanctuary Alliance just needs to be more careful, we’ll deal with it when it comes. In this era, we are the rulers, and they are nothing more than old geezers!”

“The era belongs to us, not them!”

“You’re right, the era is ours, not the Ancient Era experts!” Emperor Bai, Red Dragon King and the others nodded in agreement.
