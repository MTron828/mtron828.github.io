Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Transmit a message into the palace and tell them to send reinforcements,” said the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace.

“Aye.” One of the Heaven Ultimate Gods of Nanwu Palace immediately did as he was ordered.

The auction had ended completely.

Most experts had left, only a few top experts were still staying in Star Picking Pavilion. The people of Nanwu Palace were still there as well.

Even though many experts were lusting over Huangji Golden Pill, they dared not take immediate action and had to control themselves as they were in a Star Picking Pavilion branch after all.

They were waiting.

Waiting for the people of Nanwu Palace to leave the Star Picking Pavilion. Jian Wushuang was waiting quietly as well.

The wait took a total of ten days.

After ten days, the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace finally began to depart.

As soon as the Nanwu Palace people stepped out of Star Picking Pavilion, a large number of experts including Jian Wushuang immediately followed behind.

“That’s a lot of people. There are too many experts targeting him.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were showing worries.

As he glided along, he expanded his soul power and sensed the energy of the experts around him in detail.

There were a hundred of them at the Earth Ultimate God realm or above.

Even though Earth Ultimate Gods were just there to watch and did not plan to join in the action, there were still more than twenty Heaven Ultimate Gods pursuers!!

Not for a minute did Jian Wushuang ever think the twenty over Heaven Ultimate God was there to just watch instead of taking action.

Besides, that number was only those who Jian Wushuang’s soul power could sense. He believed more experts were hiding in the surrounding void who have kept their presence hidden. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“With this many experts targeting Huangji Golden Pill, when the battle starts...” Jian Wushuang shuddered.

The crowd followed behind the Young Palace Master. They very soon left the city and arrived at the wide borderless void.

“They’re probably going to start,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

As he expected, he could sense several Heaven Ultimate Gods’ speed accelerated and caught up to block the path of those Nanwu Palace men within the sensing parameters of his soul power.

In only a short moment...

“You’re only a few Heaven Ultimate Gods and dare touch Nanwu Palace. Perhaps you’re sick of living!!” The Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master’s growl resonated between Heaven and Earth.

Following the growl, the Heaven Ultimate Gods unleashed their heaven-shaking divine aura and took action.

The big battle began in a blink.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The terrifying booming sounds exploded one after another while clanging noises could be heard from the void ahead. The noises resonated throughout the Heavens and the immense divine power expanded to a great distance.

Although Jian Wushuang and the rest of the Earth Ultimate Gods who were there to watch the action were quite a distance away from the battlegrounds, they could still feel the intense clashing of energy in the fight which made their hearts pounded violently.

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He was not considered weak at that point when it came to ability. Although his level was quite low at just a Peak Ultimate God, his battle strength was strong enough to face a Peak Earth Ultimate God. Therefore, he was still considered very powerful even when standing among actual Peak Earth Ultimate Gods.

However, the void ahead was filled with not just one or two Heaven Ultimate Gods battling, but more than ten!

Such a battle was really not something he could interfere in.

“Excluding the Young Palace Master, Nanwu Palace only has four Heaven Ultimate Gods. Although they are very strong, they are facing the attack of a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods and won’t be able to withstand it. In addition, there are still quite a few Heaven Ultimate Gods in the surrounding void who are drooling over Huangji Golden Pill but yet to take action. Nanwu Palace seems to be in a less than ideal situation.

“However, the Nanwu Palace people aren’t fools either. They probably know that they are being watched. The fact that they dare walk out of Star Picking Pavilion must mean they have something to rely on. If my guess is right, there have to be quite a few Nanwu Palace experts hiding somewhere in the surrounding void.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked around.

Just as he expected, when the battle only went on for a short moment and the four Heaven Ultimate Gods were at a disadvantage... Boom! Boom! Boom!

Ten waves of overpowering energy suddenly burst in from one direction.

The sudden appearance of the ten men left the Heaven Ultimate Gods in battle shocked beyond belief. Even the observers outside the battlefield were incredibly surprised.

The shock was only natural because the lineup of those ten was too powerful.

Among the ten men, eight of them were Heaven Ultimate Gods while the other two...were a blond youth and red-bearded strong-looking man with a battle axe. The energy they were projecting was far beyond the Heaven Ultimate Gods and reaching an all-new level!

Grand Ultimate Gods!!

The two of them were complete Grand Ultimate Gods in the flesh and blood!

As soon as the two Grand Ultimate Gods and eight Heaven Ultimate Gods arrived, the men from Nanwu Palace including the Young Palace Master rushed over to them.

They were no doubt also from Nanwu Palace!

“Two Grand Ultimate Gods, eight Heaven Ultimate Gods. What a lineup!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

The many expert observers around were also exclaiming.

“This is grand. So grand!”

“Nanwu Palace is truly worthy of its reputation. They could afford to send over such a lineup in one go. No wonder the Young Palace Master dared come out of the Star Picking Pavilion.”

“Looks like Nanwu Palace has set its mind on keeping the Huangji Golden Pill!”

The crowd exclaimed altogether.

In the middle of the battlefield, the dozen of Heaven Ultimate Gods who attacked Nanwu Palace was in trouble.

“You’re really tired of living since you dare target Nanwu Palace!”

“Kill’em all!”

The ten men who came from Nanwu Palace immediately attacked under the two Grand Ultimate Gods’ leadership.

The table turned in an instant.

On the edge of the battlefield, the slender grey-clad white-haired Senior Meng squinted and stood in the void.

Behind him were the very respectful Star Picking Pavilion’s Purple Supervisor and his three Golden Chiefs.

Naturally, they very clearly saw everything that transpired on the battlefield.

“That’s Nanwu Palace for you, sending out two Grand Ultimate Gods and eight Heaven Ultimate Gods in one go. Looks like no one can stop them from keeping Huangji Golden Pill,” exclaimed the Purple Supervisor.

“Haha, it’s not that simple.” Senior Meng smiled faintly.

The puzzled Purple Supervisor asked, “Senior Meng, do you mean that things might change?”

“I can tell from the looks of it.” Senior Meng did not elaborate further but wore a mysterious smile instead.

As he predicted, a few beams of overpowering energy burst out from the surrounding void not long after the arrival of those ten Nanwu Palace experts.

Three Grand Ultimate Gods and a few very powerful Heaven Ultimate Gods immediately appeared on the battlefield.
