“Stronger than the Star King?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“The Star King passed the test four million years ago and left the Star Island. But it took him about a million years to achieve this. While you, only spent two hundred years on the Star Island before leaving.”

“One used for nearly a million years, the other one only used little more than two hundred years. It is obvious which one has more talent.

“And a top genius like you, as long as you don’t stumble along the way, will surely continue to achieve remarkable things in the future, so I believe what you just said.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“No one has reached the task of the fourth Black Tower, but you do stand a chance.”

Obviously, the Dao Master Kong Ming approved of Jian Wushuang’s talent and potential.

“I will give you the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit on one condition.” Said the Dao Master Kong Ming.

“What’s the condition?” Jian Wushuang asked instantly.

“I will give you one hundred thousand years. You must come back to the Star Island in one hundred thousand years and then attempt the challenge of the fourth Black Tower. I won’t blame you if you don’t succeed. And you must never blame me for being too cruel if you are not qualified. ”

“I know that you have a couple of friends on this Island. I might not be able to hurt you, but I know how to deal with them.”

“Remember, one hundred thousand years. If I fail to see any hope of you returning to pass the task of the fourth Black Tower. Then I swear I will do everything in my power to torture those friends of yours.” Dao Master Kong Ming said with coldness in his eyes.

“One hundred thousand years?” Jian Wushuang frowned and hesitated for a while, then he nodded heavily, “I promise you, I will be back in One hundred thousand years. By that time, if I’m not qualified for the fourth Black Tower, I will give you a treasure ten times the value of the Fruit.”

“Also, I hope that my friends will be safe and no harm shall come to them in those years.”

“That can be arranged.” Dao Master Kong Ming nodded, he then waved his hand and toss over a fruit, “This is the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit you ask for.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the fruit in his hands.

The look of this fruit is very strange. This oval-shaped fruit is divided into two sides of colors, one side is black, the other is white.

“And the fruit also emits a unique fragrance that makes people desire it.”

“So this is the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit.” Jian Wushuang was delighted, and carefully put the Fruit into his Interspatial Ring.

“Well, now that we made our agreement, I shall no longer bother you.” Jian Wushuang made a salute to Dao Master Kong Ming, he then turned and left.

Dao Master Kong Ming stared the back of Jian Wushuang with expectation in his eyes.

“Lord Spirit Sound, I’m ready to leave now.” Jian Wushuang came to meet the Lord Spirit Sound.

Lord Spirit Sound nodded his head and led Jian Wushuang to the center of the Stellar Fog Sea; a small untended island.

There is basically nothing on this island other than a huge space wormhole.

But this wormhole is completely sealed.

“This wormhole connects to the world outside the Stellar Fog Sea. It is the only way out and can only be launched by me.” said the Lord Spirit Sound.

Jian Wushuang nodded softly.

“This island in front of his eyes just lies there in the Fog Sea. Often, , there were too many experts wandering in this Fog sea, some of them may had found this island, but it still wouldn’t make any difference, even if they found the island and the wormhole.”

Only the Lord Spirit Sound has the ability to launch this wormhole.

As for others, even if they are really talented in Formation, can never launch the wormhole.

Lord Spirit Sound walked near the wormhole, and then made a few unique gestures towards it, soon enough the space wormhole was launched.

“The wormhole will transfer you to somewhere random near the Stellar Fog Sea, just go.” Lord Spirit Sound waved his hands.

Jian Wushuang without any hesitation, walked straight into the wormhole.

When he stepped into the wormhole, a weird light sparkled. Then the figure of Jian Wushuang vanished into the wormhole.

…

The boundless Stellar Fog Sea covers a huge area.

The area it covers is way larger than a normal Realm in the Eternal World.

Somewhere near the Stellar Fog Sea, a space rift suddenly appeared in the peaceful void. Then a figure in red burst out from the rift.

“Finally made your way out?”

Jian Wushuang looked around himself the moment he regained his composure.

What he saw was a wild lush forest with no grey fog in the air. It was obvious that he really had left the Stellar Fog Sea.

“I spent more than two hundred years in this Stellar Fog Sea. What a long time.” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

It may be that two hundred years is just a flash in other Eternal Realms, but to Jian Wushuang it was such a long time.

“Blood Mountain.” The solid voice of the Witch King echoed in the heart of Jian Wushuang.

The Witch King thinks of Jian Wushuang as his master, and lives inside his body. He and Jian Wushuang are connected by heart and blood, so they can communicate with their minds.

“Witch King, I’m now the your master, so I may as well just tell you that my real name is not Blood Mountain, but Jian Wushuang.” Jian Wushuang professed.

“Jian Wushuang?” The Witch King doesn’t seem to be surprised and continued to say: “You are an Inverse Cultivator, yet now you have only reached the level of Divine Realm expert, that is just too weak!”

“Now you just got out of the Stellar Fog Sea, your priority should be looking for a quiet place, shut yourself off and cultivate so that you can break through to the Eternal Realm. Then you shall absorb the power of the Essence Blood from master slowly. If you do so, your overall strength will sure to reach a whole new level.”

“Shut myself off?” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “not so fast. I still have some pressing issues to take care of. After that, I will do as you suggest.”

Jian Wushuang was qualified enough to break through the Eternal Realm long ago. All he needed now was some time to cultivate in private.

But now, he had to go back to the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, and take Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit to Wang Yuan for the Crape Myrtle Elixir which can restrain the Icy Heart Poison in Leng Rushuang’s body.

He is in no hurry for the break through. After all the years he spent on the Star Island, he just doesn’t care about it this time.

“I was just transferred from the Stellar Fog Sea, and now have no idea where I am. Maybe I should ask someone for directions. “Jian Wushuang thought to himself while his body was already moving foward.
