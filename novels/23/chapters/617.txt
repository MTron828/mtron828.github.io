Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Ouyang Xuan, bastard, I found you!”

At the Drill Ground where the geniuses of the Eternal World were gathered, a shout sounded. A white-robed young man was aggressively brandishing his long gold spear.

The power had burst out from the long gold spear.

The long spear glittered with gold and shone like the sun. It immediately drew the attention of all the warriors. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“That spear move!”

Audible gasps were heard around the Ancient World camp as warriors saw the spear.

“His Secret Skill is so terrifying!”

Dark Emperor narrowed his eyes and Ming Liu stiffened.

Jian Wushuang also couldn’t help looking at the man.

“He perfectly mastered a pure Light Dao. The spearmanship he displayed was an advanced Rank One Secret Skill that he created himself!” Jian Wushuang surmised.

The man being attacked was a well-groomed young man holding a folding fan. As the white-robed man approached him, the young man lightly waved his folding fan in the air. As he turned his hand, waves erupted.

The white-robed man’s spear was engulfed by the waves and its power was quickly weakened. Soon its attack was neutralized.

“What?”

“That’s it?”

“He defused it with such a slight move?”

People of the Ancient World camp cried out in astonishment.

They had thought that the white-robed man was strong because of his deep Dao comprehension and his powerful Secret Skill. But on seeing the well-groomed man’s move, they realized that he was much stronger.

“He has a high comprehension of?Waterdrop Dao. He has nearly completed the Occult in the first level.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

After defusing the white-robed man’s attack, the well-groomed man made another move, which seemed languid and simple. But as the folding fan moved, a storm of terrible Sword Essence was released.

Whoosh!

Almost instantaneously, a sparkling sword light reached the white-robed man from over 30 meters away. The white-robed man looked grave when he saw the incoming attack. He immediately thrust his long spear and it rushed forward like a golden dragon.

Bang!

The two forces collided with great force. Geniuses of the Eternal World standing nearby dodged as its impact reverberated through the immediate area. The impact of the collision continued to rush to the ground but caused it no harm.

In the air, the white-robed man gave a choked cry and stepped back in confusion. His right hand which held the long spear trembled slightly.

“Kill me? You’re not strong enough.” The well-groomed man said with a smile. His voice was like a warm and gentle breeze.

The white-robed man’s eyes blazed angrily and bitterly.

He had already been defeated.

“So strong!”

“These two men are terrible!”

“Especially the well-groomed man, he simultaneously comprehended Waterdrop Dao and Gale Dao, both at high levels. He has also created a powerful Secret Skill. He is much more powerful than me.”

The Skyscraping Realm warriors of the Ancient World Camp looked at them in shock.

They had witnessed every detail of the clash.

That was why they were shocked. They were so strong, stronger than most of them.

“God, how could they be so strong?” Dark Emperor was despaired inwardly.

He had created his own Secret Skill. Therefore, he had been confident that he was better than average among the Skyscraping Realm warriors in the Ancient World Camp.

Just now, he had been angry at receiving disdainful glances from the geniuses of the Eternal World. He had thought that their pride was unjustified.

Now, he knew that they really were very strong.

Either of the two men could defeat or kill him easily.

They were stronger than him in Dao comprehension and Secret Skills. He did not even have the courage to fight them.

Furthermore, they were just two ordinary warriors among the Eternal World’s geniuses.

He could tell from their playful smiles.

The well-groomed man was stronger, but he was not necessarily ranked in the top ten.

“Are they geniuses of the Eternal World?”

Jian Wushuang muttered as he looked at the two men with blazing eyes.

He had reached a new stage after three years of earnest cultivation. He had lost interest fighting Dark Emperor, Ming Liu or people like them. He was now more interested in challenging the geniuses of the Eternal World.

Having witnessed their fight, Jian Wushuang’s heart surged with excitement and battle intent.

Several other geniuses in the Ancient World camp had the same sentiments as Jian Wushuang.

“Eternal World, this is the Eternal World!”

“Experts and geniuses are as numerous as clouds. Everyone here is no weaker than me!”

“Hehe, I’m expecting to fight them!”

People like Feng, Huo Ying and Jian Wushuang felt excitement instead of fear.

They had been unrivaled for too many years.

Now they had rivals.
