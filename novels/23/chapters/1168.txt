Chapter 1169: Fear!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The spectral image of the red-haired cold elder appeared in the world. It was only a spectral image of consciousness, but it still carried the power enough to destroy this entire Ancient World.

Seeing the red-haired cold elder, many surrounding Warriors trembled and could not help but feel a feeling of worship.

It was like seeing a real god.

In fact, with his strength, the red-haired cold elder did hold a god-like position in the Ancient World.

“Master!”

Kong Ming was elated and started to regain his confidence.

“So what if you’re a Dao Master? My master is the famousDao Master Blood Tusk in the Eternal World.” Kong Ming scorned Jian Wushuang in his heart.

“Dao Master Blood Tusk?” Jiwan Wushuang smiled strangely.

He heard of Dao Master Blood Tusk. He was a Dao Master at the Peak of Rank Two, and was indeed a strong expert even on Void Continent. Moreover, he was said to be a protege of Ape Holy Master. With a benefactor like that, he really had a good reason to look down the entire Void Continent experts.

“Is it you that wants to kill my disciple?” The consciousness spectral image of Dao Master Blood Tusk looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s me. What do you propose?” Jian Wushuang smirked. “Do you want to stop me by a spectral image of consciousness?”

“Well, I can’t really. But, mark my words, if you dare to touch my disciple, I’ll guarantee that, on the entire Void Continent, there’ll be no place for you!” Dao Master Blood Tusk warned in a cold tone.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang cocked an eyebrow and laughed. “You really can talk, but I don’t know where such confidence came from, just because Ape Holy Master is backing you?”

“Do you know Ape Holy Master?” Dao Master Blood Tusk immediately frowned.

Ape Holy Master was the absolute overlord of Void Continent, and the monarch of North Sea Kingdom of the four big countries!

He had both strength and influence. On Void Continent, almost no one dared to mess with him.

But now, the scarlet-robed young man, who knew Ape Holy Master was backing him, still looked confident, as if he did not take Ape Holy Master seriously.

“Kid, who are you?” Dao Master Blood Tusk glared at Jian Wushuang.

“I am just an ordinary person from the Ancient World. I have just entered the Eternal World about 2,000 years ago. As for my name, I am afraid it’ll disturb you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Disturb me?” Dao Master Blood Tusk was disdainful.

“Master, this person is called Jian Wushuang, and he has only been in the Eternal World for two thousand years. I do not know how he got to be a Dao Master.” Kong Ming added.

However, hearing Kong Ming, Dao Master Blood Tusk’s consciousness spectral image froze on the spot.

His originally cold face turned into a shocked one, with terror in his eyes.

“What, what is his name again?” Dao Master Blood Tusk teeth chattered from fear.

“His name is Jian Wushuang. What’s the matter?” Kong Ming was in doubt.

Hearing Kong Ming confirmed, Dao Master Blood Tusk was awestruck and dazed.

Jian Wushuang?

Among the top powerhouses on Void Continent, how many of them did not know Jian Wushuang?

Although he had never seen him, he had heard Jian Wushuang numerous times from Ape Holy Master and many other Dao Masters.

He actually had been a headache and a monster in Ape Holy Master’s eyes!

And now, he told the monster that he would leave him no place on Void Continent?

Had he really said that?

“Ma—master Jian Wushuang!” Dao Master Blood Tusk spoke again, but this time his voice trembled.

His words left the whole battlefield in chaos.

And Kong Ming was completely stunned.

Master?

His master Dao Master Blood Tusk actually called him master after hearing his name?

Didn’t you call the opponent master only when the opponent was too strong to be messed with?

Could it be that this Jian Wushuang who had only been in the Eternal World for 2,000 years, made his master Dao Master Blood Tusk scared?

Moon Queen Lan, as well as many disciples of the Wushuang Sword Pavilion, were stunned.

Although they did not know how strong Dao Master Blood Tusk was, they knew that Kong Ming was already formidable, and his master must be even more mighty.

But the very Dao Master Blood Tusk actually became so scared after hearing Jian Wushuang’s name?

In two thousand years, what had Jian Wushuang gone through?

What level had he reached?

“Dao Master Blood Tusk.” Jian Wushuang spoke, and the voice was still bland. “I’ll take your disciple’s life.”

“No problem.” Dao Master Blood Tusk answered, “This damn thing has actually offended you, he deserves to die. Even if you don’t do it, I will personally kill him when we return to the Eternal World.”

“Master…” Kong Ming’s eyes widened and he looked shocked.

His master had always been looking for the disciples, but now he did not hesitate to throw him away. Obviously, his master was terrified of the Dao Master called Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuag squinted and the immaterial Sword Essence that had been suspended in the Void once again plucked. This time, it directly shot into Kong Ming’s head crushed his Life Core.

Kong Ming died on the spot.

This scene made Spirit Palace Master tremble, and dare not to move.

“As for you…” Jian Wushuang peeked at Dao Master Blood Tusk’s consciousness spectral image and muttered. “You’d better stay in the place where you live now, and it’s best not to tell anyone about it today.”

“I, I have already reported it to Ape Holy Master.” Dao Master Blood Tusk was horrified.

“Oh? Just him?” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

“Yes, just him.” Dao Master Blood Tusk nodded quickly.

“Alright, off you go.” Jian Wushaung waved.

“Master, so today…” Dao Master Blood Tusk carefully looked at Jian Wushuang. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll let it go.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Thank you, master.” Dao Master Blood Tusk felt relieved, and bowed respectfully. Then his consciousness spectral image disappeared in the Void.

Jian Wushuang looked in the direction where Dao Master Blood Tusk vanished.

Dao Master Blood Tusk did not know that even if Jian Wushuang let him off, that did not mean others would not.
