Chapter 2416: The Collapse of Trial Bridge

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable!”

Nobody knew more than Crimson Stone Saint about how difficult it was to cross the eighth trial bridge.

Most importantly, because almost everybody who entered Saint’s Tomb was Second-Class and First-Class Divine Demons, the trial was designed based on that Divine Demon level as a standard.

This also meant a mere Chaotic Realm Fighter had passed challenges that were for First and Second-Class Divine Demons.

“Miracle!”

That was the only word Crimson Stone Saint could use to describe that moment.

“Too bad this kid is gifted in sword principles instead of spear principles, otherwise...” Crimson Stone Saint was obviously feeling envious.

He was envious of Purple Blood Saint, who left behind his sword principles insights and sword skills only to be obtained by a real sword genius—even a sword freak.

If Purple Blood Saint knew that his sword skills were passed down to an incredible genius, he would probably be smiling in his dreams.

As for Crimson Stone Saint himself, he had placed his inheritance inside Saint’s Tomb as well. However, he could not even find a genius disciple who was barely up to his standards.

On the trial bridge, with Jian Wushuang passing the tests, two light streams burst out and directly shot at him from the end of the bridge.

The two light streams were two jade slips pieces.

One of the jade slips recorded Purple Blood Saint’s insights on sword principles. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The other had Purple Blood Saint’s Purple Blood Sword Principle.

“Thank you very much.”

Jian Wushuang took the jade slips and slightly bowed toward the end of the trial bridge before turning around and left.

Just as he was leaving the trial bridge, cracks started appearing on the surface of the bridge that connected two abysses and started shaking violently. The trial bridge collapsed within only a second. Its countless debris fell into the abyss below and was completely swallowed by the sea of fire.

The eighth trial bridge had disappeared!

...

Surrounding the edge of the abyss, other than Jian Wushuang, the rest of the nine Narcissus Island disciples were gathered there.

Almost all nine of them took their chances on the trial bridge, but none including Zhong Yi could pass the tests.

The only person who actually obtained something was Su Tong. For better or worse, she learned two spear forms while nobody else gained anything.

“It’s almost been five days and Jian Wushuang is still on the trial bridge. Isn’t this odd?” asked one of the core disciples.

Someone else nodded. “It’s a little odd as he is on the eighth trial bridge. I know the tests there consist of 81 floors with a gradual increase on each floor’s difficulty level. It’s probably the hardest challenge of all. Saint’s Tomb has opened so many times, and so many swordsmen geniuses tried crossing that trial bridge, but the best performance so far was a genius swordsman from 8,000 years ago called Lin Mang, who passed the 73rd floor.”

“To be able to pass the 73rd floor is considered marvelous, but still far from passing the entire test. The designated time frame was only ten days, now that five days have passed and Jian Wushuang still remains in there, I would guess that he has at least passed the 50th floor.”

“Breaking through 50 floors, isn’t that quite something?” asked a surprised core disciple.

“Barely. After all, the challenges get harder with each floor. It’s quite feasible in the beginning. If someone could pass 50 floors, he would probably be considered a medium-level genius among all the swordsmen who entered the tomb this time. However, taking into consideration that he is only in the Chaotic Realm, it’s really quite amazing to be able to reach that point.”

The disciples were just chatting casually.

They were not in a hurry, as they had tried out all the tests which they should have tried. All they had to do now was to restore their energy and wait patiently for the arrival of other sects’ genius disciples and the final six positions to appear. As for how many days Jian Wushuang could remain on the trial bridge, it did not concern them.

However, right then...

Hum~~~ The ground started vibrating.

“What’s going on?” The nine Narcissus Island disciples were immediately alarmed.

In only a matter of seconds, they discovered the vibration’s source.

“It’s there, on the trial bridge. It’s the one that Jian Wushuang is on.”

Exclamations of surprise rose as everybody looked over at the trial bridge which Jian Wushuang was on.

However, Jian Wushuang had already left the bridge at that moment. It began to collapse as soon as he stepped off the trial bridge.

Within only a few moments, the eighth trial bridge completely vanished from everybody’s sight.

The nine Narcissus Island disciples at the edge of the abyss were all dumbfounded by the mere sight of it.

“It collapsed?”

“The Trial Bridge has collapsed?”

“Does... Does that mean...”

They all looked over in disbelief at Jian Wushuang’s direction.

They knew quite a lot about Saint’s Tomb, hence they naturally knew what a collapsed trial bridge symbolized. It symbolized that the opportunity presented by the test had already been obtained. The test was gone, thus the bridge collapsed and vanished forever.

This proved that somebody had passed the eighth trial bridge’s test since it had collapsed!

Who would that be?

It was surely Jian Wushuang without a doubt, who had remained on the bridge for a total of five days!!

“My apologies for making you wait, Senior Brothers.”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang was already standing before the nine disciples.

“Jian... Junior Brother Jian Wushuang.” Zhong Yi looked at Jian Wushuang at a loss and asked with a slight doubt, “You passed the test on the Trial Bridge?”

“Aye, I had pretty good luck,” said a smiling Jian Wushuang.

“You really passed it?” Zhong Yi felt a little numb on the skull.

The core disciples around him were feeling the same way.

Nobody could believe it.

The eighth trial bridge was such a huge challenge that after so many openings of the Saint’s Tomb, the previous best performing genius swordsman could only pass the 73rd floor. However, it was passed through by someone merely at the Chaotic Realm.

The most unbelievable part being this someone was only at the Chaotic Realm and merely a Narcissus Island outer disciple.

An outer disciple passed the hardest test, and yet the core disciples, including the one considered strongest among them—other than Su Tong—did not get anything from the trial bridge.

If anyone among the core disciples could still barely remain calm, it was probably Xiao Heng.

Xiao Heng knew how terrifying Jian Wushuang could be. In contrast to the fact that Jian Wushuang could defeat First-Class Divine Demons when he was only at the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, him finishing the arduous test with his Chaotic Realm was much easier for him to accept.
