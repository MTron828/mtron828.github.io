Chapter 429: Fight! Fight!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bridge of Helplessness!

Jian Wushuang had mastered it when he was in Nanyang Continent.

It was powerful but used too much Spiritual Power. Therefore, Jian Wushuang generally didn’t use it. Fighting with Deng Huo, an expert of Heaven-defying Level, he had to use it.

“Fight!”

A deep shout rose, then a strong sense of battle intent surged in Jian Wushuang. He was like a marvelous Asura in scarlet armor. Pushing out with his feet, Jian Wushuang jumped up to the void with a roar.?The two Sword Soul Phantoms behind him were also full of battle intent.

In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of Deng Huo.

Boom!

A sword stabbed out, decisively and desperately.

It was still the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, Desperation!

Deng Huo’s look was frosty. When the sword approached him, he felt pressured.

Acting with caution, he raised his cyan saber and waved it with all his forces, one by one, the dazzling light flashed like a sun. Apparently, Deng Huo was also using his best moves.

BANG!

An explosion erupted, releasing a power which seemed to almost destroy the world.

Before the impact forces dissipated completely, Jian Wushuang moved his sword forcefully to counter the impact force. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three moves of Desperation in succession were displayed and each one was fast and decisive.

“Humph!”

Deng Huo snorted, the dazzling light on him was shining even brighter and the cyan saber in his hand was also sending out beams one by one.

In a twinkling, they fought at close quarters.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The constant bangs vibrated in the Jiushe Cave Mansion. Luckily it was an impregnable cave mansion built by the Jiushe Lord himself, otherwise, such a fierce fight would have destroyed it.

Bang!

With another roar, both Jian Wushuang and Deng Huo were forced back.

Deng Huo backed and leaned on the wall, looking at Jian Wushuang in shock, “Where does this young man come from? He can fight with me like this.”

Deng Huo was surprised, he was good at fighting at close quarters. If fighting at close quarters, he was capable of battling with the Lord.

But he was unable to suppress Jian Wushuang in the last several attacks.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of excitement. He also admitted, “Deng Huo is really a super expert of Heaven-defying Level. He has faced Desperation more than ten times in succession with the help of Bridge of Helplessness, but none of them prevailed.”

“Compared with a super expert of Heaven-defying Level, I’m much weaker.”

Jian Wushuang knew that he had tried his best right now.

As his strongest move, Desperation was powerful but at the same time consumed his Spiritual Power.

What’s more, he also used two Secret Skills: Road to the Underworld and Bridge of Helplessness. Especially the Bridge of Helplessness, it consumed Spiritual Power too much and too quickly.

In such a short moment, he had consumed more than 80 percent of his Spiritual Power and had too little left to continue fighting with Deng Huo.

Though he had more Spiritual Power than normal Saint Realm because of his Heavenly Creation Skill.

If it were anyone else, their Spiritual Power would have been used up.

Compared to Deng Huo, whose breath was still strong. Although he had used some Spiritual Power, his battle strength was still powerful. That was because he used what he was good at, which only consumed very little Spiritual Power.

“They are really powerful movements. However, the more powerful they are, the more difficult it is to use them. It seems you have exhausted most of your Spiritual Power, haven’t you?” Deng Huo looked at Jian Wushuang, “Having Double First-grade Sword Soul, you have more potential than me and it’s possible for you to surpass me. But now, you have no chance!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

While saying this, a stream of killing intent was gathering in Deng Huo’s eyes.

He was shocked by Jian Wushuang’s potential, especially his Double First-grade Sword Soul.

Even if it was him, he had made great efforts to have a second-grade Sword Soul.

Such a peerless genius of great potential, who is also an expert of the opposing camp.... how could Deng Huo let him off?

“Boy, go to hell!”

Deng Huo shouted and came at Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang’s breath had weakened and the Blood River, including the Bridge of Helplessness had vanished. It seemed he had little battle strength right now.

After seeing Deng Huo rushing towards him, Jian Wushuang’s mouth had a cold smile.

“Kill me? You are not strong enough.”

Then he waved his hand and released a streak of Flowing Light.

Immediately a big and tall figure in scarlet armor, boots and scarlet helmet showed up, it was Jian Wushuang’s Blood Puppet.

Jian Wushuang gave the Blood Puppet three Blood Gems this time!

After taking the Blood Gems, Blood Puppet’s eyes gleamed like thunder and lightning.

“Blood Puppet, kill him!”

Giving it an instruction, Jian Wushuang stepped back and took some Spiritual Power elixirs to restore his Spiritual Power.

Receiving Jian Wushuang’s instruction, Blood Puppet turned into a blood light and faced Deng Huo.

“A Puppet?”

Watching a Blood Puppet rushing towards him, Deng Huo was surprised but he didn’t care.

The Blood Puppet clenched its right fist, gathering a terrible power in it.

Standing behind and holding his breath, Jian Wushuang was hopeful.

“A Blood Puppet made by the Sword Ancestor himself...”

“With one Blood Gem, the Blood Puppet was able to defeat Xue Luo, who was quite strong in power and defense!”

“Three Blood Gems this time!”

“Let me see how powerful the Blood Puppet is with three Blood Gems.”
