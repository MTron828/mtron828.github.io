Chapter 1088: The Secret of the Green Fire World (Ⅱ)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“That was a horrifying battle in which people fought each other desperately!”

“The Jin Kingdom’s top experts far exceeded those in our palace. Nonetheless, there were many people in the Green Fire World.”

“Apart from our palace, all the other forces and a large number of solitary experts in the Green Fire World were involved in that battle. Relying on the advantage of the number of people, we repelled the Jin Kindom after paying a terrible price.”

“And among the six top experts above the Celestial Master Level in the Green Fire World, two died in that battle!”

“Many forces were annihilated in that battle. For example, the top experts in the force controlled by Celestial Master Zhong, the old man you just saw, were almost exterminated.”

Jian Wushuang was astonished but hurriedly asked, “We only repelled the Jin Kingdom by paying such a heavy price?”

“That was not a bad result.”

Celestial Master Yu Ding smiled bitterly, “The experts from the Jin Kingdom suffered great losses in that war too. Our Palace Masters placed a formidable Restriction on this battlefield at a great cost and blocked all experts from the Jin Kingdom here. Neither could they leave nor send the message out. This has led to the present stalemate.”

“Stalemate?” Jian Wushuang’s heart throbbed.

“Yes, we and the Jin Kindom are fighting crazily in the battlefield presently, whether it is for scrambling for treasures or the intense hatred toward each other. In short, our palace would never stop fighting with the Jin Kindom unless all of us died.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank and he asked, “Who gains the upper hand in the fighting?”

“For the time being, the Jin Kingdom gains the upper hand. After all, it possesses too many Celestial Masters. Although quite a few experts died in the previous battle, more than half were left. The number of its experts far exceeds that of our palace. Moreover, its experts’ strength is superior to ours. However, we are just temporarily the underdog.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said confidently.

“Its experts are trapped there all the time without reinforcements, thus, they will all die one day. Unlike them, our palace is supported by the entire Green Fire World and there is a steady stream of experts appearing continually. Our world has been on this battlefield since its birth and its foundation is stronger than that of the Jin Kingdom. The Jin Kingdom can only look at the three Secret Lands controlled by our palace in despair.”

“Three Secret Lands?” Jian Wushuang asked confusedly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Celestial Master Yu Ding explained, “They are the Space-time Secret Land, Sword World, and Heart-tempering Road!”

“The opening times of the three Secret Lands are different.”

“The Space-time Secret Land opens every a million years!”

“The Sword World opens every one hundred thousand years.”

“The Heart-tempering Road opens every ten thousand years!”

“Your father was so lucky that he encountered the opening of the Space-time Secret Land as he just joined the Green Fire Palace. He has a lot of talent and his Master is one of the five Palace Masters, so he was entitled to enter the Space-time Secret Land. Then, earth-shaking changes took place on his strength.”

Jian Wushuang understood all this after hearing Celestial Master Yu Ding’s words.

He knew that his father had practiced in a Secret Land for more than 100,000 years, but time did not pass so quickly in the outside world.

The Secret Land his father had entered should be the Space-time Secret Land.

“The battlefield we are on is a great treasure. Our world just found these three Secret Lands temporarily. I speculate there must be more Secret Lands and opportunities hiding on this battlefield. Since the establishment of our palace, many experts have found countless opportunities there.”

“Jian Wushuang, you just joined the Green Fire Palace, so don’t covet the three Secret Lands for the time being. There is a place that is filled with opportunities where any member of the Green Fire Palace can enter and gain huge benefits.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“Where?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Don’t worry, I will bring you there later. Now, I will take you somewhere else.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

They came to a scarlet pavilion.

Although it only had three floors, it appeared very tall.

“Where are we?” Jian Wushuang had the look of confusion on his face.

“The Fire Point Exchange Office of our palace.” Celestial Master Yu Ding answered smilingly.

“Fire Point? Exchange Office?” Jian Wushuang felt very confused.

“The Fire Point is something named by our palace and it’s equal to point or something like the battle achievement.” Celestial Master Yu Ding explained smilingly.

Jian Wushuang understood immediately.

At the same time, he was aware of the significance of the Exchange Office.

“You have been in the Green Fire World for so long, so I don’t need to explain the use of the Exchange Office for you.?I’ll just tell you something different.”

Celestial Master Yu Ding continued, “The scarlet tower is, in fact, a rare treasure that our experts found on the battlefield. It possesses intelligence and has quite a discerning eye. It can not only recognize many treasures but also is able to estimate their value. And that’s why we take it as the Exchange Office.”

“You are aware that there are many good things left on the battlefield. Most of our experts don’t recognize these treasures and their value. However, this scarlet tower can assess that.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang finally had a general understanding about that.

Right at this moment, Gu King said with disdain inside Jian Wushuang’s body,?“Nonsense. It’s merely a lowest-grade Priceless Treasure Vault that spread here from the Eternal Chaotic World. How can it recognize too many treasures?”

“Gu King, what do you mean?”?Jian Wushuang asked.

“Most of the Sects and forces in the Eternal Chaotic World has Treasure Vaults that is used for their experts or disciples to exchange treasures. For the sake of convenience, some experts especially refined the Priceless Treasure Vaults which can automatically estimate the value of treasures. The higher their grades are, the more treasures they can recognize.”

“The scarlet tower in front of you is a lowest-grade Priceless Treasure Vault. It’s only able to judge the value of some very common treasures in the Eternal Chaotic World. However, it might be unable to estimate the value of some treasures of higher value, for example, your Blood-killing Plate Armor, let alone your Mountain River Map.”?Gu King said.

“Really?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up. “Does that mean in the Exchange Office, there might be some treasures of great value that are estimated as something of low value?”

”?Probably. You can observe them carefully when you enter the tower later. Maybe you can find some nice things.”?Gu King said.
