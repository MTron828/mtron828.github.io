——

The beautiful woman did not know that although Jian Wushuang was only a rank six True Saint, he was a perfect chaotic creature with a high level of life. Even though he was only a rank six True Saint, his divine power was still as powerful as many Peak Saints, once he used the seven-star secret skill, the Divine Punishment God, and the nine luminaries star armor, his divine power would rise to the level of an Invincible Saint.

Of course, the judgment power of an Invincible Saint was much stronger than that of a peak saint like this beautiful woman.

“Feixue, leave Su Ying to me. Go help Duan Lang,” Jian Wushuang said. This beautiful woman, Su Ying, was an extremely powerful peak saint. She was one of the experts that Qian Hongzi had told him about, Jian Wushuang could recognize her at a glance.

“Okay.” Feixue was also charging toward the beautiful woman. After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, she immediately turned around and headed toward the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang relied on his divine power, which was stronger than her, and his swordsmanship to fight head-on with Su Ying. In a short period of time, he had the absolute advantage in terms of strength, Su Ying was obviously weaker than Jian Wushuang.

The six from the Temporal Temple had already fought with the five from the destruction Saint Realm. As for the three from the Purple Myrtle Sect, they seized the opportunity to escape.

They did not join hands with the Temporal Temple to fight against the five from the Destruction Saint Realm, so Jian Wushuang and the others were not surprised.

The Purple Myrtle Sect was only a relatively large force in the Second Heaven. They did not have the courage to challenge the Destruction Saint Realm. Even if the Destruction Saint Realm attacked them first, they would not dare to fight back until the critical moment, they still did not dare to fight back.

At this moment…

Buzz!

A pitch-black ax shadow suddenly condensed in the center of the battlefield.

An unprecedented destructive aura also spread out from the ax shadow.

The moment the ax shadow took shape, everyone on the battlefield was instantly attracted by the ax shadow.

“This ax…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.

This ax shadow gave him a feeling that he could not block it.

It was invincible!

The surroundings of the Thunder God had already turned into a giant thunder prison. In this thunder prison, he was the ruler. He controlled the power of millions of thunderbolts. In an instant, the endless power of thunderbolts gathered and formed a terrifying thunder beast, the thunder beast opened its mouth, wanting to swallow the ax shadow.

But in the end…

Bang!

The ax shadow split everything in front of it.

That huge thunder beast was also split into two halves by this ax shadow. The mighty ax shadow descended, and even the Thunder God was unable to block it.

With a loud bang, the Thunder God’s body was sent flying. It took a long time before he regained his balance.

“This ax!”

“Di Hao!”

Thunder God’s eyes flashed with a terrifying light as he stared at Di Hao. Then, he looked at the other battlefields around him.

On the other battlefields, the Temporal Temple had the absolute advantage.

After all, the Temporal Temple had one more person than the Destruction Saint Realm. Moreover, in terms of quality, Di Hao was fighting against him. Qian Hongzi was fighting against another Invincible Saint of the Destruction Saint Realm. Both sides were evenly matched, the last Invincible Saint of the Destruction Saint Realm was entangled by Duan Lang and Feixue.

Duan Lang used the Black Demon Realm and his battle strength barely reached the level of an Invincible Saint. Together with Feixue, he was not afraid of the Invincible Saint of the Saint Realm of destruction.

As for the remaining two Peak Saints of the Destruction Saint Realm, one was fighting with Yue Yu, who was suppressed by his tyrannical strength. The last one was the beautiful woman, Su Ying, who was fighting against Jian Wushuang, according to reason, the two people with the biggest gap in strength had been at a disadvantage in the battle between Su Ying and Jian Wushuang.

The entire situation was obviously disadvantageous to the Destruction Saint Realm.

“Retreat!”

Thunder God had already recognized the situation in front of him. He did not want to continue fighting with the people of the Temporal Temple and directly gave the order to retreat.

Immediately, the people of the Destruction Saint Realm used their means to get rid of their opponents and leave this place.

“You want to escape? It’s not that easy!” Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, Yue Yu, and Feixue were all trying to stop them.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly turned cold.

“It’s not easy to attack the people from the Destruction Saint Realm. How can we let them escape so easily? At least one or two of them should stay.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with killing intent, he glanced at Su Ying, who had already turned around and was about to retreat, but his body swayed slightly.

‘Buzz!’ Jian Wushuang disappeared.

At least in the perception of the surrounding people, he had completely disappeared.

Su Ying was ready to meet up with the Thunder God. She was not slow, and she was very close to the Thunder God.

But suddenly…a cold sword light appeared out of thin air behind her and instantly pierced toward her heart.

This sword light appeared too suddenly, and its speed was incredibly fast. Most importantly, there was not a single trace of power or movement, and it was completely silent.

Su Ying did not have the time to react at all.

“Ah!”

A shrill scream suddenly sounded out from Su Ying’s mouth. Su Ying lowered his head with great difficulty, only to discover that a blood-colored sharp sword had already pierced through her chest, and at the same time, it fused into the three drops of ‘cold blood’ venom within the sword, it immediately began to work.

“Bzzz!” Su Ying’s divine body instantly collapsed.

“Not good!”

“Junior Sister Su Ying!”

The faces of Thunder God and the remaining three from the Destruction Saint Realm all changed drastically.

They were preparing to leave this place, while the Temporal Temple was chasing after them. At this critical moment, Su Ying was actually caught up by them, and his divine body was directly destroyed…although Su Ying’s divine body had only collapsed, he had not died yet, one had to know that while his divine body was reassembling, he could not move. At this moment, the members of the Temporal Temple had already crazily pounced on Su Ying.

“Kill her!”

“Haha, we can’t escape, right?”

Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, Yue Yu, and Feixue all attacked without hesitation. Su Ying’s divine body had not had the time to reassemble before it was dealt a devastating blow. Even Thunder God and the others did not have the time to rescue him before they were directly killed.

“Damn it!”

Thunder God and the other three from the Destruction Saint Realm looked extremely upset when they saw this, but they could do nothing.

“Let’s go!”

Thunder God shouted in a low voice, and the four of them rushed into the void in front of them.

Jian Wushuang and the others did not chase after them.

The huge battlefield quickly calmed down.

Jian Wushuang stood there and looked at the void where Su Ying died, but his face was extremely cold, “As expected of an expert from the three Saint Realms. His divine power is much more abundant than that of an ordinary Peak Saint. My Blood Mountain Sword can fuse three drops of cold blood poison at the same time. These three drops of cold blood poison are enough to erode more than half of the divine power of an ordinary Peak Saint. Under normal circumstances, I can kill an ordinary Peak Saint with two strikes!”

“As for Su Ying, I just noticed that he was defeated by my sword, and only lost 30% of his divine power….”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
