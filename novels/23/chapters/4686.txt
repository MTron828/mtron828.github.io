4687 Slaying Yan Immortal (1)

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “You sound very experienced.”

“Of course. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this,” the thin figure said. “However, you don’t look panicked at all. It’s a little unexpected.”

“Panicking won’t help. It’s better to think about how to leave,” Jian Wushuang looked around and said in a deep voice.

“I advise you not to think about it. Even if you are a Yan Immortal, you can not escape from here,” the thin figure said indifferently, as if he had tried all the methods he could think of.

Jian Wushuang stopped talking and looked down at the dark abyss.

“I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Chun Qiu. What’s your name?” the slim figure said calmly in an extremely remote corner.

“Jian Wushuang,” he said concisely.

The skinny man named Chun Qiu raised his eyebrows and stopped talking. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The pitch-black vines that seemed unwilling to make a big fuss over the two fish that had escaped the net stopped twitching, and the entire abyss fell into a strange, dead silence.

A golden light gushed out of the corner of Jian Wushuang’s eyes. At the same time, the Four Seasons Domain of the Tarot Sword Dao quietly covered the entire abyss.

“Jian Wushuang, did you hear anything?” Chun Qiu raised his head and said warily.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. The next moment, he shouted, “Run!”

However, it was too late. The stone walls around them burst open at the same time, and countless black vines swarmed out like giant pythons, squeezing toward the two.

As Jian Wushuang had already released his Domain to be on guard, he leaped into the air and barely avoided the vines when they came at him.

By the time Chun Qiu reacted, it was already too late. He was directly dragged into the abyss by the vines.

“Jian Wushuang–”

“This guy!” Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, turned around, and rushed into the abyss.

The radiance of Yan power that appeared in his eyes allowed him to easily see through the darkness.

The further down they went, the more densely the python-like vines piled up, and there was almost no space for them to step on.

As for Chun Qiu, he did not know where he was.

With a wave of his hand, he summoned an Invisible Sword, and the vast aura of the Wushuang Sword Dao immediately surged and raged.

Perhaps sensing the danger, dozens of vines went against the current.

Jian Wushuang raised his sword and broke it.

The vast derivation of power allowed every move of the Wushuang Sword Dao to reach the peak easily. Even though he was bound, the Wushuang Sword Intant still easily tore open the encirclement.

At this moment, Chun Qiu’s thin figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

He swung his sword to cut off the vines that bound him. Divine blood gushed out of his mouth and nose.

“Are you alright?” After surviving the tribulation, Chun Qiu asked while gasping for breath.

Jian Wushuang did not answer. He grabbed him by the collar and prepared to leave.

In the next moment, countless vines intertwined above their heads, blocking their way.

“Damn it, does this thing have eyes? Let’s go!” Chun Qiu shouted in a low voice, and a similar majestic aura emerged from his body.

The Ancestor realm!

Jian Wushuang looked sideways at him and then looked down at the abyss.

Jian Wushuang, who never liked being passive, directly released the first move of the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intant, Star.

The vast Yan power condensed into Wushuang Sword Intent, which swept under the abyss. It was like pouring boiling oil into water, and it completely exploded.

Yan power had elevated the entire Wushuang Sword Dao to another level. Even if it was an Ancestor realm, Jian Wushuang was confident that he could destroy it with one sword strike.

Under this Wushuang Sword Intent, the vines were shattered on a large scale, and human-like screams rang out in the abyss.

Meanwhile, Chun Qiu, who was standing at the side, gulped in disbelief.

This kind of vine that lived in the depths of the black mountain and had the power to steal the Fortune of heaven and earth was so difficult to deal with that even Yan Immortal would be helpless.

However, now, they were all destroyed by this guy who had entered the mountain for the first time. It was too terrifying.

“Since he has such strength, how could he have been captured and brought here?” A series of question marks exploded in Chun Qiu’s mind, but he had no answer.

Almost at the same time as the Sword Intent dissipated, Jian Wushuang flew straight into the abyss.

Chun Qiu was startled, but he gritted his teeth and followed.

The Invisible Sword in his hand cut off all the vines. His eyes, which were surging with brilliant divine patterns, seemed to see the real gaze behind the scenes. He suddenly threw the long sword in his hand.

Clang!

The sound of metal clashing resounded. At the same time, a dark figure looked at Jian Wushuang in the dark and was about to leave.

“You want to leave?” Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice and a small Transcendence Heavenly Gate appeared. It crushed the dark figure directly.

Even though it had changed from divine power to Yan power, the purest divine glyph had not changed.

The palm that was surrounded by a seven-colored light descended, illuminating the dark figure with no place to hide.

Only then did the two of them see clearly what the pitch-black figure looked like.

The long face, which looked like the skin of a 10,000-year-old tree, was ferocious and ugly. Perhaps it was because it had lived in the dark for a long time, its eyes had seriously degenerated to the size of green beans.

The python-like vines were the hair of the black figure.

A look of disgust appeared in Chun Qiu’s eyes. “As expected, those who like to suck blood do not have handsome looks.”

The huge palm pressed down on him without any suspense, but Jian Wushuang was not relaxed either. Another stream of divine blood gushed out of his mouth.

He forcefully used Yan power, and the restraint of the chain iron plate on his neck became stronger.

Chun Qiu became even more nervous. “Jian Wushuang, are you really okay?” We can’t stay here for long, I think we should leave quickly.”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything and just looked down.

When the divine light emitted by the Transcendence Heavenly Gate completely dissipated, the dark figure was revealed.

Even though most of his Daoist robe was torn, his life source was not injured at all.

Perhaps he had found out that Jian Wushuang could not do him any harm. He rolled his bean-sized eyes and his body expanded in the wind. Then, he turned back to his original form and tried to swallow the two of them.

Beyond the Ancestor realm, the Yan power that belonged to the Yan Immortal was like the deep sea, roaring and devouring.

Chun Qiu’s face was ashen, and he was so scared he felt like his soul was leaving his body.

Only Jian Wushuang was not afraid. An Invisible Sword appeared in his hand and he stabbed out without any fancy moves.

This ordinary sword strike could flip the sky and shake the earth. It was a sword strike that was independent of the Wushuang Sword Dao.

It was the Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi’s favorite sword technique, the Extinctive Sword.

After the first sword strike, it was 100,000 sword strikes.

100,000 sword rays broke through the darkness and poured onto that pitch-black Yan Immortal’s figure.

The smugness in the eyes of the two green beans did not even show before it was replaced by fear.

How could he use such a suppressive sword strike that belonged to the Profound realm?

However, this sword attack was indeed fully executed, as if Ding Baiyi was helping him.
