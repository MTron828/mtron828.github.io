Chapter 2485: Hundred and Thousand Fold Payback!

On the glade far and wide, a huge Golden Prison was suspended in mid-air.

The various sects’ experts could only hear the horrifying peal of thunder from the prison but had no idea what was happening in it.

With a loud bang, a huge hole blasted through one of the Golden Prison’s corners and three piteous figures shot out from the hole at their fastest speed to the distant heaven.

The Golden Prison completely disappeared after the trio escaped.

The golden divine power had also dissipated and revealed a figure in the Golden Prison’s center.

Jian Wushuang looked magnificent and stunning with his sword in one hand and the 900-feet-tall Golden God Shadow behind him.

In the void at a distance, the three piteous Ultimate Gods had lost their tyrannical posture.

Lei Chong—his face was quite pale with blood dripping from the corners of his mouth while the black thunderbolts around his body dimmed.

Fan Jianxian—his breath was extremely weak while the sword intent surrounding him was decadent.

The worst was An Junzhu. Although she was still shrouded in darkness, everyone noticed her missing arm!

The three Ultimate Gods were extremely miserable.

On the other hand, there were no signs of defeat or disadvantages on Jian Wushuang. In fact, the aura emanating from him was much stronger than before.

Looking at the brutal contrast, the various sects’ experts instantly understood the battle’s outcome.

“The three Ultimate Gods joined forces and lost?”

Everyone was shocked and speechless. Of course, a small number of them were starting to get somewhat used to this familiar scene.

Starting from the opening of Saint’s Tomb up to where they were, Jian Wushuang had proven his strength through multiple battles, rising from an unknown figure to someone terrifying.

There was a massacre in the tomb and almost no one thought he could survive being besieged by many genius disciples, but he survived.

Facing the siege of nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demon disciples—including several Twelve Minor Kings—everyone thought he was dead meat. However, the nearly 50 genius disciples were defeated by him. He was peerless throughout his time in the tomb.

After Jian Wushuang came out of the tomb, the various sects’ experts had joined forces to kill him. Everyone thought that Jian Wushuang was bound to die. In conclusion, he instantly killed Tu Qiancheng before killing Han Yun and three other Peak Divine Demons who fought against him in a formation. At that time, everyone was appalled by his capabilities.

Thereafter, Supreme Elder Fan Jianxian of the Great Compassion Sect challenged him to a duel.

Again, everyone thought no matter how strong Jian Wushuang was, he would not be able to do much before an Ultimate God, but Fan Jianxian was defeated by Jian Wushuang to everyone’s astonishment.

Up until his latest battle, three Ultimate Gods fought against Jian Wushuang, yet those Ultimate Gods were defeated.

It was a miracle. Jian Wushuang had created multiple nearly impossible miracles within a few months’ time since the opening of Saint’s Tomb. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Genius, Demon, or even Monster were no longer appropriate words to describe Jian Wushuang.

Many experts had then looked at Jian Wushuang like looking at a truly omnipotent God.

And at that very moment, the omnipotent God-like young man in their eyes was advancing forward step-by-step with his sword pointed up at the heavens.

As he slowly approached those three Ultimate Gods, there was a sneer on his face. “You three Ultimate Gods sure escaped fast.”

The trio felt extremely ashamed upon hearing his claim.

Three Ultimate Gods joined forces against one Divine Demon and yet they were defeated altogether to the point they had to play their trump card to escape from the Golden Prison.

That was truly embarrassing.

Jian Wushuang stopped, but the jeering smile on his face was bigger than ever. “You can run, but you can’t hide. If the three of you escape, what about the remaining Great Compassion Sect’s genius disciples? And how could your Great Compassion Sect tame my anger?” Lei Chong and the other two Ultimate Gods were startled when Jian Wushuang said so.

On the glade, Great Compassion Sect’s genius disciples such as Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing were bitterly disappointed.

They discovered Jian Wushuang was very close to them. If Jian Wushuang took his anger out on them, they could possibly be instantly killed by Jian Wushuang with no room to struggle as they were only disciples in the Divine Demon realm.

Even Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing would never have any chance of surviving when facing Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, what exactly do you want to do?” Lei Chong shouted loudly.

“What am I going to do? You have to ask yourself this question.” Jian Wushuang’s voice became cold.

“From the moment I stepped into the tomb, I did nothing wrong and had not provoked anyone. Despite that, the genius disciples in the tomb came after me again and again. First, Pang Tao forced me to surrender the sword principle opportunities that I’ve earned. After that, Pang Tao wanted to put me to death in the fight for the position token. Out of no choice, I had killed him.”

Subsequently, the Great Compassion Sect’s genius disciples went berserk and wanted to kill me madly. Even after I came out of the tomb, your Great Compassion Sect was among the first to attack me. Tu Qiancheng, the Four Great Peak Divine Demons, and lastly you three Supreme Elders. Have I ever provoked any of you?”

Now, isn’t it ridiculous for you to ask me what I wanted to do?”

Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed throughout the glade and shook the heavens.

The various sects’ experts wore a strange look on their faces when they heard that.

They thought about it carefully and seemed that it was as Jian Wushuang had said, he did not provoke anyone.

On the other hand, it was those greedy people who had actively sought trouble with Jian Wushuang.

Apart from the Great Compassion Sect’s disciples, other various sects’ disciples were also beheaded by Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang came out of the tomb, it was Tu Qiancheng and the others who picked a fight with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had been passive and merely fought for his life.

In fact, Jian Wushuang suffered a big loss.

In the distant void, those three Ultimate Gods were unsteady as they knew they were at fault.

Lei Chong’s voice eased. “Jian Wushuang. This incident may have been started by the Great Compassion Sect, but you have killed many of our disciples who are genius disciples...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. “So what? I believe in the principle of doing good unto people who are good. If anyone offends me, I will pay back a hundred or even a thousand times worse!”
