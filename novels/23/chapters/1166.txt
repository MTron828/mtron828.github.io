Chapter 1167: Queen Lanyue

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Haha, Lin Lan, or should I call you the famous Queen Lanyue? I said that one day, I will completely wipe out your Wushuang Sword Pavilion and make you mine. Today, you can’t run, can you?” A tall, bald man was waving his big ax and laughing wildly.

His opponent was a glamorous and beautiful woman. This woman had a perfect body and face, and most importantly, a very noble and incomparable temperament.

Queen Lanyue was crowned the female emperor because she had always held a high status.

For more than two thousand years, her Wushuang Sword Pavilion had never been touched; her title of the female emperor was well-deserved.

“Well, you’re not qualified to mess with me yet.” The voice of Queen Lanyue was cold and fierce. With an air of majesty, she swept her longsword and broke out her full strength of Skyscraping Realm. There were many strong players on the field, but no one could confront her.

Even the talkative bald man who was the Palace Master of Spirit Palace in Skyscraping Realm had to admit that Queen Lanyue was definitely much better than him.

“Haha, I can’t touch you, but someone can and will.” The bald man laughed and looked at Void next to him. “Master Kong, it’s your turn.”

“Master Kong?” Queen Lanyue’s eyes narrowed.

The bald man was in the Skyscraping Realm and could beat all of the Divine Land experts. Who was qualified to make him respectfully call master?

Soon, she saw Master Kong.

It turned out to be a chubby elder who had a pair of eyes as small as those of mouses.

This chubby old man slowly walked over and soon appeared in front of Queen Lanyue.

“Is she Queen Lanyue?” The chubby old man looked Queen Lanyue as if she had been an ant.

“That’s her.” The bald man respectfully said.

Queen Lanyue looked grave.

Normally, with her strength, in Ancient World, no one should be able to fear her. However, when the chubby old man appeared in front of her, she had an instinct feeling of terror and even pictured herself losing the battle.

This chubby old man stood there, and Queen Lanyue did not even have the courage to fight back.

“Who are you?” She clenched her teeth, suppressed her fear hard, and shouted.

“I’m Kong Ming.” The chubby old man spoke.

Queen Lanyue’s heart sank.

She never heard of a formidable expert called Kong Ming, not only on Divine Land but also in other Ancient Worlds.

The horror that this Kong Ming brought to her…

“You are from the Eternal World?” Queen Lanyue asked coldly.

“You are not stupid.”

The chubby old man smiled and confessed. “I heard that you have been collecting the Ancient World Tokens for many years. You want to go to the Eternal World, right?” In addition, I also heard from the Place Master of Spirit Palace that you have a master; your Wushuang Sword Pavilion is named after him.

“Your master is said to have gone to Eternal World by Ancient World Tokens more than two thousand years ago. If I’m right, you want to go to Eternal World to find your master, right? Haha, what a good apprentice!

“Unfortunately, you misunderstand the Eternal World. Your master might be something in the Ancient World, but once he reaches the Eternal World, he will find that he is just a cockroach. In the Eternal World, there are a lot of people stronger than him. He went to the Eternal World alone, and I’m afraid that he would have died long ago.”

Upon hearing this, Queen Lanyue clenched her teeth and suppressed her anger.

She respected her master most in her entire life.

Her master reinvented her, she attributed her current achievements entirely to her master Jian Wushuang.

In her heart, her master was the same as God.

Thus, even when she created her own force, she named it after her master.

In recent years, as the Firmament Territory Feast was about to open again, she had desperately collected the Ancient World Tokens only to keep up with the pace of her master.

Now, when she heard such nonsense, she would naturally turn furious.

At this time, Kong Ming spoke once again. “Since you really want to go to the Eternal World, I can help you. From today, you will be with me and serve me. If you do a great job, when I recover, I’ll take you to the Eternal World, and even find your master, how about that?”

Hearing this, Queen Lanyue was even more angered.

“Why? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Are you reluctant?” Kong Ming smirked.

“Master Kong?” The Spirit Palace Master frowned. He also longed for a woman like Queen Lanyue.

Who in the world did not want to conquer a peerless woman like her? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Do you have a problem with that?” Kong Ming peeked sideways at the Spirit Palace Master.

“No, I don’t.” The Spirit Palace Master shook his head fearfully.

“Well, you just follow my orders and make preparations in time so that I can quickly recover. I’ll get everything you want, but if you can’t help me, you have to die either!” Kong Ming scolded.

“Yes, my lord!” The Spirit Palace Master nodded in a row, in fear that Master Kong would be unhappy.

He knew very clearly that this Master Kong, despite being seriously injured and lesser than his usual strength, could still kill him like an ant.

“Queen Lanyue, I’m not that patient, do you really want to give away this opportunity?” Kong Ming glimpsed her one more time.

“You want me to serve you? You wish!” Queen Lanyue shouted coldly.

“Oh?” you’re not willing to?” Kong Ming cocked one eyebrow and smiled coolly. “Then I’ll have to do it the hard way.”

Finishing his words, he waved his hand and summoned a huge palm. The giant hand appeared, and the whole world shook. The surrounding Void cracked; huge space rifts appear, and all the engaged people in Wushuang Sword Pavilion stopped and fled.

In moments, the giant hand approached Queen Lanyue.
