4139 The Seventh Person

Time flew by in a flash.

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

In front of a gigantic cosmic passageway in the Life Palace, Ninth Kalpa King, Ruler Violet Eye, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, and the other three were already waiting.

“Ruler Blood Wave sent us a message earlier. He said that apart from the six of us, there will be another person joining our team for this trip to the Tarot Ruins. Can you guess who that person is?” Ruler Violet Eye was dressed in flowing clouds and black clothes, he wore a violet-gold crown, and his eyes flickered with violet light as he smiled in curiosity.

“There are quite a few Supreme overlords who have reached the peak of power within the Life Palace. However, they are quite powerful, and they should be able to spare some of their forces for the time being. As for the seventh person, as long as he doesn’t slow us down, that should be enough.” The handsome Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves said coldly.

“It’s hard to say…” Marquis Qingfeng said.

The Ruler Violet Eye and the others were chatting casually. Clearly, they did not have a good impression of this seventh person who had suddenly cut in.

Of the six, only the white-haired Ninth Kalpa King did not participate in the discussion. He stood there calmly with his hands behind his back. There was not any emotion on his face.

For him, it did not matter if there was one more person in this trial squad or one less person. It would not affect him at all.

He was the only one in his eyes after entering the Tarot Ruins.

As for the others, such as the Ruler Violet Eye and Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves, he, Ninth Kalpa King, did not even bother to look at them.

Shoo!

Just as everyone was discussing, a stream of light suddenly swept over from the horizon at an extremely fast speed.

At the beginning, the stream of light was just a tiny black dot on the horizon. A few seconds later, the stream of light continued to enlarge and stood in front of them.

“It’s coming!” Everyone looked up and focused.

The streamer dispersed and revealed a cold-looking black-clothed figure.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s him?”

“The seventh person is Jian Wushuang? Isn’t he a fourth-level Ruler? Why is he here?”

The Ruler Violet Eye and the others looked at each other with a hint of surprise on their faces. However, after they exchanged a glance, they all smiled at Jian Wushuang in a friendly manner.

They were all excellent Ultimate Rulers, so no one was a fool. Jian Wushuang’s talent and potential were right in front of them. He was someone who could fight with Ninth Kalpa King in the trial field and win, compared with Ninth Kalpa King, he was only inferior to him in realm.

Unsurprisingly, Jian Wushuang would be at least at the level of Ninth Kalpa King, an invincible existence among Rulers, even if he was not a Supreme-being.

The Ruler Violet Eye and the others naturally did not want to ridicule such a genius who could be expected in the future.

“Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect that the seventh person would be you. Why are you here, a fourth-level Ruler?” Ninth Kalpa King, who had not spoken for a long time, narrowed his eyes at Jian Wushuang and sneered.

“Ninth Kalpa King.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, and his expression was indifferent. “You don’t have to worry about me.”

Hearing this, Ninth Kalpa King raised his eyebrows and sneered even more. “I’m the leader of this team. You’d better listen to my orders during this period of time. Otherwise, if something happens, don’t blame me for not helping you!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang sneered and did not comment.

Seeing this, the other five Rulers could not help shaking their heads with a bitter smile.

They all knew what had happened between Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King. Obviously, both Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang were proud people, so they were not surprised by this scene.

“Gentlemen, we are a small team going to explore the Archean ruins, and there are many dangers hidden in the Archean ruins. I think you should be more amiable.” Ruler Violet Eye tried to smooth things over.

“Humph.” Ninth Kalpa King snorted and did not say much.

“Since everyone is here, let’s go.”

Immediately, the universe passage opened, and the seven people entered the universe passage.

Through the universe passage, although they could not directly reach the great solar Star Field where Tarot Ruins was located, they could still save a lot of time.

In the vast and boundless universe, numerous milky ways stretched across the sky, and stars dotted the sky, forming a brilliant sea of stars. A huge black universe boat was like a shooting star, rapidly gliding through the starry sky, it left behind a long trail of flames.

The place where Tarot Ruins appeared was located in a corner in the depths of the universe. Even though a large amount of time had been saved through the universe passageway and they were riding on a universe boat of a higher grade, they still had to travel through the universe void space, they still had to travel for more than 1,000 years.

“The next star domain is the star Sun Great Star Domain. We only need to travel for another 100 years to reach Tarot Ruins.” In the universe boat, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves looked at the Resplendent Sea of stars in front of him, he said excitedly.

They had spent nearly a thousand years in the universe boat, and they had been facing a desolate universe all day long. They had long become impatient. Now that the Tarot Ruins was right in front of them, they could not help but feel excited.

Ruler Violet Eye said with a smile, “Speaking of which, the star Sun Great Star Domain is located in one of the many great star domains in the depths of the universe. Although it is a little remote, it is still quite prosperous. The Ruler of the star Sun Great Star Domain has already broken through and reached the Ruler level. If this Ruler of the star Sun Great Star Domain knew how to manage things, he would be able to stand firmly in the depths of the universe for at most ten chaos cycles. Unfortunately, the Tarot Ruins was born in the star Sun Great Star Domain.”

“Furthermore, after Ruler eternal Yang discovered the Tarot Ruins, he wanted to take it all for himself. Didn’t he think that he was just an ordinary Ruler? How could he take it all for himself? In the end, he brought him a huge disaster. Not only was he killed, even the various factions and sects in the Star Solar System were wiped out. Now, other than the Tarot Ruins, the entire star solar system is no different from desolate star.”

Everyone was talking among themselves. They were excited about the arrival of the Tarot Ruins.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in a corner and slowly opened his eyes.

In the past thousand years, he had completely refined and mastered the principle armor given to him by Ruler Blood Wave. He had also adjusted all aspects of his body to the peak and completely stabilized himself at the fourth level of the Ruler realm, his strength had more or less improved.

After 100 years, the universe boat that Jian Wushuang and the others were on had arrived in the Star Field and was heading toward the Tarot Ruins.

During the 100 years, universe boats from other places had rushed over and made the starry sky extremely bright.
