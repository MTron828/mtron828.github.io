Chapter 2938: The Pursuit

——

“Are the people from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance here?”

Many high-level experts from the Black Dragon Mountain had already gathered in the void, and the one leading them was the weathered Elder.

The weathered Elder and the Immortal Saints behind him also noticed Xue Yu’s existence. Seeing the terrifying aura that Xue Yu emitted, their bodies and hearts could not help but tremble.

Xue Yu glanced at the vicissitudes of life Elder and the others with her cold eyes.

Then… whoosh!

She directly rushed out like a stream of light.

“You guys retreat quickly!”

The vicissitudes of life Elder let out a roar, and a powerful aura immediately emerged from his body.

This aura had also reached the True Saint realm, and it was much stronger than that of Saint Hong, who had fought Jian Wushuang head-on. It should have reached the peak of the first rank True Saint realm, he immediately displayed his strongest strength in an attempt to block Xue Yu.

However, after coming into contact with Xue Yu…

In just one exchange, the saber light formed by Xue Yu’s single hand directly cut off the old man’s arm.

Then, he struck out with his single hand. Before the old man could even react, his divine body was destroyed.

Buzz buzz buzz.

Divine power began to gather in the sky.

The weathered Elder controlled the immortal body. After his divine body collapsed, he immediately relied on his divine power to rebuild his divine body.

When Xue Yu saw this, she did not stop him. However, when the weathered Elder’s divine body was full, she struck out with her saber again.

Bang!

The weathered Elder’s divine body collapsed again, and then it was rebuilt again.

This was repeated five times.

“Heaven-cleaving Alliance, I have no regrets in dying. Please give me a chance to live!”

After the old man died hysterically, his body collapsed for the sixth time.

However, after this collapse, he could not reassemble again. Instead, he died.

“Is he dead?”

“A True Saint with an immortal body was killed just like that?”

“A heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is too terrifying!”

The five Immortal Saints and twenty-seven Divine Masters who had come to participate in the assessment widened their eyes in shock.

The weathered Elder was a True Saint with an immortal body. However, after this battle, the weathered Elder had no room to fight back. Even if he had an immortal body, he was still killed by Xue Yu.

They were shocked by Xue Yu’s strength. At the same time, they understood that having an immortal body did not mean that he was immortal.

“The immortal body is indeed sufficient, but it requires a lot of divine power to regenerate. The Elder’s divine power was only enough for him to regenerate five times. After that, he was killed by Xue Yu.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

However, he also understood that the vicissitudes of life had killed the old man so easily because he did not want to escape. He had no chance to escape.

However, if it were any other True Saint, they would immediately try to escape after knowing that they were no match for Xue Yu. If he could regenerate his divine body five times, he would have five chances to escape.

The weathered Elder, who was also the ancestor of the Black Dragon Mountain, was killed by Xue Yu.

This scene happened in front of the experts of the Black Dragon Mountain. When the experts of the Black Dragon Mountain saw this, they were not only furious but also terrified.

Yes, even their ancestor was killed so easily, let alone them?

They did not know what they were going to face.

But at this moment, Xue Yu, who had killed the Elder, did not continue to attack the experts of Black Dragon Mountain. Instead, he turned around and returned to the side of the goateed Elder.

“Master Xue Yu, thank you for your trouble.” The goateed Elder said gratefully.

“Yes.” Xue Yu nodded slightly, turned around, and left.

“He left? Master Xue Yu actually left?” The people who came to participate in the assessment were baffled.

Only Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and vaguely understood the content of the assessment.

At this time, the goateed Elder walked toward the experts of Black Dragon Mountain.

He came to the experts of Black Dragon Mountain and smiled faintly. “Everyone of Black Dragon Mountain, listen up. After today, Black Dragon Mountain will no longer exist. This is the punishment for your Black Dragon Mountain provoking the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

The figures of the experts from the Black Dragon Mountain trembled, but they were helpless.

“Although the Black Dragon Mountain will completely disappear, the cultivators from the Black Dragon Mountain, other than the ancestor of the Black Dragon Mountain who was killed just now, have a chance to survive.”

Hearing these words, the experts from the Black Dragon Mountain raised their heads in unison. Numerous gazes were fixed on the goateed old man.

The goateed Elder smiled cunningly and said, “What you need to do is very simple. You need to do your best to escape.”

“Escape?” The experts of the Black Dragon Mountain were stunned.

The goateed Elder continued. “The land where the Black Dragon Mountain is located can be considered a relatively small continent. Even an Immortal Saint would need two to three days to cross this land. I can give you one day to escape first. You can escape to this land. You can hide anywhere except underground. After one day, the Immortal Saints and the invincible reverends behind me will frantically search for and kill them!”

“This search and pursuit will last for ten days. After ten days, our people will stop and those who survive will be able to leave safely.”

The experts from Black Dragon Mountain looked at each other.

They finally understood the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s purpose. It was obvious that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance treated them as a training mission.

They had to survive for ten days in the pursuit of these experts from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!

Ten days was not a long time, but it was not short either.

“Fortunately, as long as we can escape this pursuit, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will show mercy.”

“Humph, this land is so big, and the Heaven-cleaving Alliance only has so few people. It’s not easy to find us.”

“We thought we were going to die, but now it seems that our chances of survival are still very high.”

Many experts in Black Dragon Mountain were whispering.

“Sir.” Black Dragon Mountain thought the black-haired man made a deep voice. The aura of the black-haired man was as strong as that of Xue Dong King, who had fought with Jian Wushuang. Apparently, he was also a top False Saint.

“During the ten days of pursuit, if the experts of Black Dragon Mountain meet the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, they will fight. But if they are killed by us during the battle…”

“Haha, you don’t have to worry about this. These little fellows behind me can only be considered as members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance after they pass the test. They are not yet members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” the goateed Elder said with a strange smile.
