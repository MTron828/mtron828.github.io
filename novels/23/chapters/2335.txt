Chapter 2336: The Most Powerful Sword Cultivator In Anjiu Prefecture

“Chaotic Divine Demon, sword cultivator. You have reached initial success in the Sword Doctrine Realm. If I am not wrong, you are known as the most powerful sword cultivator in the Anjiu Prefecture, right? Zhuge Yun?” Jian Wushuang looked at Zhuge Yun calmly.

“Looks like I am quite famous within the Anjiu Prefecture. Any random youngster can recognize me. However, you cannot just call me so casually,” Zhuge Yun said coldly.

“Youngster?”

“I’m sorry. From today, the title of the most powerful sword cultivator in the Anjiu Prefecture will belong to the youngster standing before you right now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Huh?” Zhuge Yun was stunned before he mocked, “Stop boasting. You are only in the Chaotic Realm. Even your father is no match for me. What makes you think that you can beat me?”

He was surprised by the fact that Jian Wushuang was in the Chaotic Realm.

Even though Jian Wushuang had just broken through into the Chaotic Realm, there was no way he, as a Chaotic Divine Demon, could deal with a mere Chaotic Realm expert.

That would be a joke.

“Father, watch me,” Jian Wushuang said. As soon as he finished his sentence, he attacked.

Zhuo Yunfeng wanted to say something. However, he realised Jian Wushuang had disappeared. By the time Jian Wushuang reappeared, he was already right in front of Zhuge Yun.

“This speed...” Zhuo Yunfeng widened his eyes in surprise.

Even he was surprised at the speed Jian Wushuang travelled.

“Huh?” Zhuge Yun was also surprised.

The speed Jian Wushuang had was on par with, if not faster, than his.

When Jian Wushuang reappeared, a sword light formed.

This swing seemed ordinary, as though Jian Wushuang did not put in effort to the swing at all.

As a sword cultivator, Zhuge Yun saw that Jian Wushuang’s attack was extraordinary.

“This sword, is it...” Zhuge Yun seemed to notice something different. He counterattacked immediately. A white, unique sword light was seen as it shot out like a venomous cobra.

Clang!

The two swords collided. Sword essences were gushing around wildly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang tilted his sword and flicked up lightly. The sword in his hands was headed for Zhuge Yun’s throat at a speed so fast that he barely had time to react.

“Shhh~~”

Zhuge Yun sucked in a cold breath. He had to react. He too flicked his sword up to block Jian Wushuang’s sword skills.

“Get lost!” Zhuge Yun roared as he slashed at Jian Wushuang with a slash so powerful that it could even split Heaven and Earth apart.

Jian Wushuang simply backed off to the side to evade this attack.

“You are incredibly fast with the martial art motion you have mastered. You have grasped the Spacetime Rules of Order and your understanding of the Sword Doctrine is at the level of Profound Realm?” Zhuge Yun looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

It was rare to see experts in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm being enlightened to the Spacetime Rules of Order. Even though it was rare, there was more than one expert who had managed to do that in the Wusha Barren Region.

However, an expert in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm was in the Profound Realm of the Sword Doctrine Realm?

That was absurd.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang was not even twenty years old yet.

An expert in his teens was enlightened to Rules of Order and had reached the Profound Realm in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine?

“Is he a monster? An anomaly?” Zhuge Yun exclaimed softly.

There were many geniuses in this world, and there were many of them within the Anjiu Prefecture as well.

For example, Zhuge Hong, Xiang Tuo from the Xiang Family and Lin Tao from the Lin Family were all geniuses.

These geniuses would attract the attention of the clans within the Wusha Barren Region, but they would not go crazy over them.

Under normal circumstances, these clans would only go after those unbelievably and incredibly talented geniuses.

Zhuge Yun felt that Jian Wushuang was one of the people classified as an unbelievably and incredibly talented genius.

He was out of this world.

There might not be another man as talented as Jian Wushuang from the Wusha Barren Region.

Once the clans from the Wusha Barren Region found out about the existence of such an insanely talented person, they would fight to recruit him at all cost.

An intense flame of killing intent lit up in Zhuge Yun’s eyes as he thought of this.

As the enemy of such a person, it would spell disaster for the Zhuge Family in the future.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to, he could easily join clans such as the Water Fairy Island or other much more powerful clans. He could give certain conditions to these clans, such as annihilating the Zhuge Family, before he would join them. Zhuge Yun believed that these top-tier clans would agree without hesitation and would even break certain agreements with other clans to fulfill Jian Wushuang’s conditions.

“This person must die!” Zhuge Yun was boiling with killing intent. A ray of white sword light appeared again, This time, it was brighter and even more shiny.

“You want to kill me?” Jian Wushuang pursed his lips. He looked to the sword in his hand and said, “Blood Mountain Sword. Today, we will fight till our heart’s content.”

Hum~ Hum~

The Blood Mountain Sword trembled vigorously, as though it was replying to Jian Wushuang.

“Die!” Jian Wushuang roared with a low voice as he attacked.

The two most powerful sword cultivators from the Anjiu Prefecture started their battle on the battlefield outside the Lin Mansion.

It was a fierce battle.

Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Rules of Order and the Sword Doctrine was much deeper than Zhuge Yun’s. His Blood Mountain Sword was also at a higher tier than sword that Zhuge Yun used. Jian Wushuang was only lacking in the aspect of power.

The divine power that Jian Wushuang had was at the level of a Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demon. Furthermore, he had cultivated the Immemorial Celestial Body, which had boosted his divine power to even greater heights. Even so, he was still not at the level of a real Chaotic Divine Demon.

However, there was more to divine power in a battle.

Jian Wushuang went even against Zhuge Yun by using his superior understanding of the Sword Doctrine and Rules of Order.

Both of them fought fiercely. It seemed as though both of them were evenly matched.

Zhuo Yunfeng, who was at one side, was stunned.

“Wushuang, is that really my son?”

Zhuo Yunfeng could not believe his own eyes.

“Wushuang, he... He is only in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm, yet he is going even in a battle against the most powerful sword cultivator from the Anjiu Prefecture?” Zhuo Yunfeng muttered to himself.

“No, the fight is not even. Wushuang has a small advantage?”
