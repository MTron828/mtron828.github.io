Scanning the surroundings, in the entire space, there were tens of thousands of vessels, all of which he had to immerse himself in one by one.

This wasn’t refining the body anymore; it felt like pure torture.

After hesitating for an entire day, Jian Wushuang lacked the courage to jump into the second vessel.

His determination was unwavering, but the fact that he hesitated for such a long time indicated the immense torment he endured within.

Thud!

Jian Wushuang made up his mind and offered no resistance!

Even if he fainted, it would only be a momentary feeling; he decided to endure

But upon entering the second vessel, he didn’t experience that sensation.

Instead, he felt an indescribable comfort, which soothed his physical body.

After soaking for about a day, when he emerged once more, his physical body had undergone a transformation.

The green scales on his body were gradually fading away!

And his physical strength kept increasing.

The best part was that he no longer felt that peculiar itching sensation, which boosted his confidence significantly.

This time, after coming out for just a few breaths, he decided to enter another vessel again.

But as soon as he jumped in, that strange itching sensation spread throughout his body once more, causing him to faint instantly.

This cycle repeated endlessly.

Finally, he managed to struggle through this stage.

Next, it was time for the most formidable refinement.

The ninth layer of space.

A figure in a black robe was already waiting there, and it was none other than

Shan Jun.

When Jian Wushuang arrived here, he was taken aback!

This place was still in primordial chaos, and the sky was tinted with a faint crimson hue.

Shan Jun sat cross-legged there. At first glance, it seemed very close! However, when Jian Wushuang tried to move closer, he found that no matter what he did, he couldn’t approach Shan Jun.

“An illusion?”

Puzzled, Jian Wushuang looked at Shan Jun and respectfully said, “Senior?” There was silence, no response at all.

At the next moment, a spatial crack revealed a damaged throne, with a skeleton atop it, adorned with ancient decorations and some old ornaments. This skeleton had likely been here for quite some time,

Jian Wushuang had been here for the duration of an incense stick’s burning, but his identity token provided no clues whatsoever.

This left him feeling somewhat helpless; he didn’t know what to do.

Thud, clang, clang.

Ancient notes echoed, everything here seemed peculiar.

From one of the notes, Jian Wushuang sensed a familiar sound, the demonic melody from the Demon Sound Mountain.

This ancient space and the ancient throne… What was the secret behind all this?

His mind kept working, trying to decipher everything.

“Where is this?”

“The origin source of the universe?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as he suddenly realized something.

Wasn’t this the origin source he encountered in the Universe Bronze Furnace?

Although this strand of origin was not as massive as the one in the Demon Sound Mountain, it was still significant. Moreover, just like the Demon Sound Mountain’s origin source, it also carried the demonic melody.

“I see!”

Jian Wushuang understood now!

This space was probably not the Trial Tower!

That’s why there were no hints on his identity token.

This place was likely the true core of the Universe Bronze Furnace. The crimson color above represented Shan Jun, and the notes represented the origin source of the universe.

He had been moved here, probably because of Shan Jun.

It seemed the great opportunity was not in the Emperor’s blood essence but here!

No wonder Shan Jun was so extravagant, refining the Emperor’s origin source into flesh. It was because there was an even better source of origin here, waiting for him to devour.

A majestic fish with wings, soaring through the chaotic skies, emitted the melodic notes that filled the air.

In his heart, Jian Wushuang held one thought, tinged with a hint of apprehension. This was the boon granted to him by Shan Jun, yet it was also a treasure of the Qishen Temple. If he were to devour it, Qishen Temple might not let Shan Jun off easily.

Jian Wushuang felt conflicted.

Shan Jun’s figure sat calmly, his eyes profound, observing everything. In his eyes, countless images constantly evolved.

Jian Wushuang gleaned much from this.

Though not explicitly stated, it was clear that Shan Jun had placed him here for this strand of origin source.

“If that’s the case, I shall etch this favor into my soul. If I succeed one day, the world shall only have two.”

Jian Wushuang silently swore in his heart!

The day he attained enlightenment, he would definitely free Shan Jun from the Demon-Sealing Pillar on this Demon Sound Mountain.

Such a great favor, apart from Teacher Xuan Yi, no one else could compare.

Buzz!

The fish was enormous, its wings capable of blotting out the sun, its voice akin to beautiful chants.

Enchanting.

The strand of origin source within it was even more captivating.

Jian Wushuangs figure moved, vanishing directly from the spot.

When he reappeared, he was already on the fish’s head.

The origin source within its body was exceptionally gentle; this was the first time Jian Wushuang had encountered such a mild origin source. He couldn’t even bear to swallow it in one gulp.

Previously, dealing with those remnants of Emperors in the Great Wilderness, their origin sources were extremely violent. Even the origin sources of the Grand Yan Immortals, despite his absolute strength, couldn’t be subdued peacefully.

But now, this universe’s origin source was exceptionally gentle.

Jian Wushuang squatted down slowly, gently stroking the fish’s dorsal fin, which was very smooth.

With a single hand press, a powerful devouring force began absorbing that strand of origin source. Jian Wushuangs body trembled along with it.

The power of that origin source was truly astonishing; his own origin source was expanding incessantly in this moment.

The threshold of the Extreme Dao’s origin source was also trembling, on the verge of collapse, ready to break through at any moment.

The comprehension of the spatial origin officially reached its peak at this moment, thoroughly mastering the essence of space – the very essence that only Emperors could cultivate!

Even though he was just a Grand Yan Immortal, he had truly grasped it.

Though it was his first time, his strength underwent a transformation.

He hadn’t expected that the first breakthrough would be in spatial understanding!

Next was the Extreme Dao!

The Extreme Dao encompassed all things; the universe’s essence included everything.

Following that was the Sword Dao. Unfortunately, the Sword Dao contained within this strand of origin source was too weak, not significantly enhancing his Ultimate Sword Dao.

Instead, as he absorbed these essences, he saw a scene within them.

It was a battlefield.

A woman wearing a light blue robe, standing on the battlefield as if she were a deity, untouched by the battle’s chaos. Around her waist, there was a sheathed long sword.

In the next moment, the woman’s figure flickered, too fast for Jian Wushuang to see clearly. All he saw was a massive sword shadow descending from the sky, cleaving the entire battlefield in half.

This scene was incredibly awe-inspiring; Jian Wushuangs eyes widened in amazement.

The woman was remarkably similar to the figure described by Qiuhuang!

At least, their strength seemed to be at a similar level.

This brief vision etched itself deep into Jian Wushuangs mind.

In this moment, his Ultimate Sword Dao also underwent a transformation.

Within the immense sword shadow, there was an enormous cage.

The seventh level of the Ultimate Dao!

It was complete.

He had waited for this moment for far too long.

His ultimate swordsmanship was his most potent means of combat. While the Extreme Dao encompassed many things, the ultimate path was purer, more in line with his abilities, and more complex..
