Chapter 2686: Divine Sword Official Army

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Those Heavenly Ultimate Gods are my subordinates?” Xiao Tiexin was a little dazed.

“Of course. Although your strength is too weak, these people will obey your orders now because of me. However, it will be difficult for you to control them one day if I leave the Danyang Holy Domain, so you’ve to seize the opportunity and do your best now that I have given you such high authority. You have to cultivate your power as much as possible, alright?” Jian Wushuang advised Xiao Tiexin.

He was going to leave the Danyang Holy Domain sooner or later and the Sword Alliance would be left to the care of those he trusted.

Xiao Tiexin was the best candidate, but her cultivation realm was too weak, so she must find a way to cultivate her strength.

“I see.” Xiao Tiexin nodded slightly. She was the eldest young miss of a clan and had gone through a lot, so she would know what to do.

“This Interspatial Ring is for you.” Jian Wushuang handed an Interspatial Ring to Xiao Tiexin.

After Xiao Tiexin took it, she was shocked after she browsed through its content.

“Primordial Stones... There are so many Primordial Stones. How many are there altogether?” Xiao Tiexin was horrified.

“Not much, maybe around two billion?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Two billion?” Xiao Tiexin gaped. She became a little emotional and was unable to calm down for quite some time.

“Two billion Primordial Stones isn’t much to form an official army in the Sword Alliance. To do so will cost a lot of Primordial Stones. Long Shan will ask you for Primordial Stones. You can give it to him as long as his request is for the Official Army. I’ll give these two billion to you first, come and look for me if it’s not enough,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Understood.” Xiao Tiexin nodded firmly.

“You are too weak. Go see Dong Xue and get her to find two powerful and reliable guards to be your followers. Go on then.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Xiao Tiexin immediately left.

In the palace, Jian Wushuang sat on the throne and tapped his fingers on the armrest. “The current Sword Alliance has just formed and the Official Army has just been established. I’d better just stay put before the Divine Sword Official Army combat prowess becomes powerful.”

Jian Wushuang faintly smiled and soon went into seclusion.

He wanted to take the opportunity of his seclusion to absorb those Divine Elixir Pills.

Earlier, he managed to get nearly 1,800 Divine Elixir Pills from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples and 500 Divine Elixir Pills after slaying the Purple Beast Alliance Master. He had nearly 2,300 Divine Elixir Pills at hand. The pure divine power from those Divine Elixir Pills was too much even with his refining speed. It would take a long time for him to absorb and refine all of them.

It took a year and three months before those nearly 2,300 Divine Elixir Pills were finally completely absorbed and refined by Jian Wushuang.

Just as he expected, he still failed to break through to Heaven Ultimate God Realm after refining all those 2300 Divine Elixir Pills but was not too far from it. Jian Wushuang estimated he would need at most 2,000 more Divine Elixir Pills to make a breakthrough to the Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God realm.

Once he became the Heaven Ultimate God, he would once again usher in a qualitative change to his strength.

There would not only be a huge increase in the level of divine power, but the key was the many secret techniques he cultivated would also greatly improve.

In the void above Dragon City—Jian Wushuang, Xiao Tiexin, and Long Shan were walking alongside each other with two extremely powerful Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods behind him.

Those two Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods were chosen by Xiao Tiexin to protect her.

It did not take long for the group of people to arrive over a huge camp.

“Alliance Master, this is the Divine Sword Official Army barracks. I’ll gather all the soldiers,” said Long Shan before heading toward the camp.

“Xin’er, how many Primordial Stones did Long Shan take from you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’ve given him one and a half billion. Three-quarters of the two billion Primordial Stones you gave me have been given to him,” replied Xiao Tiexin.

“It took more than a year to spend one and a half billion Primordial Stones. This Divine Sword Official Army should have begun to take shape,” commented Jian Wushuang.

The many soldiers of the Divine Sword Official Army soon gathered together and were divided into five rows—standing in lines. Jian Wushuang stood high in the sky and looked down.

There were a total of 50 soldiers each wearing black armor with special secret patterns. That black armor was a Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor with an amazingly high value. Each of them was worth about 15,000,000 Primordial Stones, 50 pieces... The defensive armor alone cost nearly 800,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Those soldiers were exuding an amazing divine power breath with every single one of them being a Heaven Ultimate God. They were the elites among the Heaven Ultimate Gods.

50 soldiers stood there carrying a very strong breath of combat power.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin immediately went down and appeared in front of Long Shan.

“Alliance Master, you told me that it’s enough to form a thirty-member Official Army in a short period but we now have fifty members thanks to the rich resources provided by Miss Xin’er. All these fifty very capable people are Heaven Ultimate Gods’ elites. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“In addition, they have mastered most of the military formations you gave them. There are five members in a small team. Each team comprises a High-level Heaven Ultimate God and four Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods. They have great combat power when paired with the military formations,” said Long Shan.

“Not bad.”

Jian Wushuang nodded approvingly. His first impression of the Divine Sword Official Army was good.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang suddenly got startled as he noticed three people seemed to look the same among the ten soldiers standing in the front row. Even their divine power breaths were also the same as all three of them were High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Who are those three?” Jian Wushuang pointed at those three people.

“Those are the three brothers of the Zhao family. The three of them are triplets.” Long Shan smiled and then he shouted, “Zhao Tianshan, Zhao Tianhe, and Zhao Tianhai, step out.”

Each of the three Zhao Brothers was extremely beefy and tall—like three small hills. They immediately stepped forward after hearing Long Shan’s comment.

At the same time, the three brothers were also looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Brother, who’s that person?” Zhao Tianhai asked.

“I haven’t seen him before, but Long Shan has a very high status in the Sword Alliance. The only person who will be treated with such respect must be the Sword Alliance Master,” said Zhao Tianshan.

“Sword Alliance Master? How is he only a High-level Ultimate God realm? Isn’t he in the same realm as us?” Zhao Tianhe muttered.

“It’s kind of interesting that the triplets not only look the same and so are their cultivation realm.” Jian Wushuang smiled. He had also met a pair of twin brothers when he was walking in the Dark Thunder Territory of the Northern Darkstar Territory.

The twin brothers had excellent tacit understanding and even created a set of Fusion Attack Techniques. Their strength was quite extraordinary.

Those High-level Heaven Ultimate God triplets looked rather extraordinary.
