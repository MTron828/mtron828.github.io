Chapter 589: Jian Wushuang, where are you!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At Sword Marquis Mansion, hundreds of clansmen stood on the huge Drill Ground. Jian Xinhong, the Mansion Master of the Sword Marquis Mansion, led the Elder. A beautiful woman named Jian Meng’er stood among the crowd.

Everyone present shared the same pale expressions at the moment.

Looks of fear, anger and hatred were directed towards a wicked man who sat on a stage at the Drill Ground.

The wicked man was clothed in a scarlet robe and had a demonic appearance. He flew through the clansmen one by one with a playful smile.

“Jian Xinhong, three days have already passed, have you decided?”

The scarlet-robed man stared at Jian Xinhong and his voice echoed coldly through the Drill Ground, “Tell me where the Ancestor’s Land is!”

Jian Xinhong took a deep breath. He raised his head, glanced at the man and slowly shook his head. Solemnly, he answered, “I don’t know!”

“You don’t know?”

The scarlet-robed man gave him a glacial look, boom! A monstrous aura rose and rushed towards Jian Xinhong.

This aura was only on the Eight-cloud Realm Level, but for Jian Xinhong who only just broken through the Yin Void Realm, it was overwhelming.

The scarlet-robed man had only emitted a little aura, but it was already powerful enough to make Jian Xinhong suffer.

Plop!

Jian Xinhong was unable to control the balance of his body. Unwillingly, he knelt in front of the scarlet-robed man and bowed his head low.

His mouth was full of blood and he could sense that his organs had shifted from the effects of the aura.

“Devil!”

“You are a devil!”

“Bastard!”

His clansmen were enraged when they witnessed their master suffer the humiliation.

However, reason told them that they had to endure the shame.

They could not fight him. Even if all the experts of the Sword Marquis Mansion fought him as one, they wouldn’t be able to hurt the scarlet-robed wicked man at all.

“Jian Xinhong!”

The scarlet-robed man had started to speak in a cold voice, “Sword Marquis Mansion is the only descendant of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor. As the Mansion Master, you really don’t know where the Ancestor’s Land is?”

“I, I...” Jian Xinhong remained in his kneeling position with his forehead touching the ground. He stuttered,?“I indeed... don’t know, but... but even if I do, I will never ever tell you!”

“Really? You really have a backbone?” The scarlet-robed man sneered. In the next moment, the oppressive aura surged.

This time, Jian Xinhong lay flat on the ground and blood flowed profusely from his pores. Soon he turned into a blood person and he lost consciousness from the excruciating pain.

“Hum, rubbish! Are you really the descendant of the Sword Ancestor? I think you are just like a worm.”

The scarlet-robed man laughed coldly. He still had not exerted all of his aura. Although Jian Xinhong was unconscious, he was still alive. As the Mansion Master of the Sword Marquis Mansion, he would be the only one who knew the whereabouts of the Ancestor’s Land. That was why the wicked man had not killed him.

“You!” the scarlet-robed man pointed at an Elder and demanded, “Tell me where the Ancestor’s Land is!”

“I don’t know,” the Elder gritted his teeth and shook his head.

As soon as the Elder’s words died, the scarlet-robed wicked man waved his hand and a greenish black ‘viper’ flew out.

This ‘viper’ was a greenish black Long Whip with hundreds of sharp greenish-black scales on its surface. As the scarlet-robed man waved, the whip hit the Elder. The Elder screamed and blood spurted from his mouth. The impact threw the Elder against a stone wall at the edge of the Drill Ground. No one knew if he was still alive.

“Elder Ying!”

The clansmen screamed.

“Bastard, I am going to kill you!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A burly clansman had yelled out. He waved his Giant Axe and slashed violently towards the scarlet-robed man.

“Don’t do it!” The people around him tried to stop him but it was too late.

As soon as the clansman started his charge, the scarlet-robed wicked man struck as well.

Chi!

The greenish black Long Whip struck through the clansman’s heart and killed him instantly.

“No!”

A shrill cry issued from the crowd, but the burly man had been killed.

“You, come here!”

The scarlet-robed man pointed to Jian Meng’er.

“Didn’t you hear me?” the scarlet-robed wicked man demanded.

Jian Meng’er trembled and raised her head. Her pretty face was filled with panic, anger, despair and madness. She struggled to move forward three steps, then stopped.

The scarlet-robed man stared at Jian Meng’er. He had licked his lips when he saw her beauty. He ordered, “Take off your clothes.”

Jian Meng’er raised her head in horror. Her eyes reflected her roiling emotions.

The scarlet-robed man lost his patience when he saw her hesitate. He waved the greenish black Long Whip, which flew towards a female toddler standing behind Jian Meng’er.

As the whip passed over the girl’s right hand, her arm was cut off.

“Wow!”

The girl shrieked in pain.

“Ling’er!”

Jian Meng’er stared at the man in fury.

That girl was her daughter!

“Take off your clothes, otherwise I’ll cut her head off.” The scarlet-robed man had a cruel expression on his face.

“I will! I will do it!”

Jian Meng’er had a painful smile on her face. The anger, panic and madness had vanished, replaced by deep despair.

Her hands slowly pulled her clothes down.

Her eyes were hollow. She was like a puppet.

However, a figure suddenly appeared in her mind.

That figure had haunted her for years.

As she plunged into despair, she thought about this person.

She finally broke down in despair.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“You... where are you!”

“Where the hell are you!”
