Chapter 79: Su Lie

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the Martial Arts Practice Field, the corner of Nangong Jie’s mouth contained a trace of blood. After slowly standing up, his expression grew ferocious and was filled with resistance.

Yes, he was not willing. He did not want to concede, even though he was defeated by Jian Wushuang after using his full power.

However, no matter how unwilling he was, it was a fact that he lost to Jian Wushuang. He could not quibble. Ultimately, he could only tremble as he gave 12,000 points to Jian Wushuang.

On the other side, the two disciples who had previously loaned points to Nangong Jie had a pale look.

After seeing more than 12,000 points in his token, Jian Wushuang grinned and faced Nangong Jie again. “Nangong Jie, I have some advice for you… Natural iniquity can be forgiven, but human iniquity can not.”

Nangong Jie trembled physically and mentally.

Suddenly… 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s a good sentence. This rookie of the Dragon Palace is becoming more and more arrogant.”

A strong voice sounded out in the Martial Arts Practice Field, slowly followed by a red-robed man with a saber on his back.

Everyone looked turned to face him at the same time.

“Su Lie!”

“It is him?”

“The tyrant, Su Lie!”

After seeing him, many of the disciples of Dragon Palace that were present couldn’t help exhaling a breath of cold air. Obviously, they were in awe of this man.

“Su Lie! Why is he here?” Wang Yuan’s expression instantly changed after seeing this person.

“Who is Su Lie?” At this moment, Yang Zaixuan, who was always silent, frowned and asked. He sensed a mighty pressure that he had only felt from Bai Cheng since the time he joined Dragon Palace three months ago.

“The tyrant Su Lie, a top genius among the disciples of Dragon Palace. Su Lie was the only one who could possibly be compared with Bai Cheng, before second brother joined Dragon Palace,” said Wang Yuan.

Hearing this, Yang Zaixuan’s eyes could not help but squint.

“A warrior, who is in the Profound Gold Core Realm, was defeated by a rookie who has only been here for three months. Not only that, the rookie is only in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Nangong Jie, you are definitely shameful enough,” said the burly man, Su Lie, with a laugh.

Nangong Jie had a pale look on his face.

If these words were said by someone else, he would be furious. However, these words were spoken by Su Lie, who was also known as a tyrant. He was afraid to display even a little bit of a temper in front of Su Lie.

Su Lie glanced at Nangong Jie, but he was too lazy to talk to him. Looking at Jian Wushuang though, he said, “little guy, your name is Swordsman, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a serious expression.

When Su Lie appeared in front of him and looked at him, all the pores in Jian Wushuang’s body were directly tied up. This feeling felt similar to being looked at by a fierce ancient beast.

Jian Wushuang immediately understood that Su Lie’s strength was terrifying.

“I have heard of you. When you entered Dragon Palace three months ago, you only made it through the fourth level. But now, three months later, you should be able to make it through the seventh level with your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. That speed is matchless in Dragon Palace. Such a genius, I can’t help being interested in you. Why not fight with me?” Su Lie said casually.

“Battle with you?” Jian Wushuang changed his countenance, but he immediately shook his head without any hesitation, and said, “Sorry, I’m not interested.”

Jian Wushuang did not want to battle with Su Lie at all.

The reason was simple. Su Lie’s strength was terrifying.

Although he never made a move and just stood in front of Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang knew that he was not this man’s opponent.

It was hard to say whether or not he could even take one move from Su Lie.

The gap in strength was incredible and Jian Wushuang had no interest in being abused.

“You are refusing me?” Su Lie’s countenance became clouded, but he suddenly grinned and said, ” I don’t want to make a bet with you, I just want a pure fight with you. Your refusal… What good is it?”

Boom!

The floor under Su Lie’s feet exploded instantly and the figure of Su Lie rushed forwards. At first glance, it looked like a mass of hot flames was fiercely racing towards Jian Wushuang.

“Oh no!”

At the moment when Su Lie started moving, two figures also rushed out, simultaneously, from behind Jian Wushuang.

Those two people, one was Yang Zaixuan, and the other was Su Rou, who rarely spoke.

As for Wang Yuan, he had only gone through the fourth level, so he was unable to help Jian Wushuang.

Two traces of flowing light appeared simultaneously, in front of Jian Wushuang.

Yang Zaixuan’s eyes were cold and his saber was already drawn.

In Su Rou’s hands, there was a two-meter-long, thick and heavy sword. Her slender figure raised the heavy sword and chopped out.

“Haha, you want to stop me by yourselves?”

Su Lie laughed while clenching his five fingers. Then, a terrifying flame filled with the Essence of Raging Fire was released. It was as if he could burn everything around it. Then, Su Lie used his fist to directly attack them.

A violent force suddenly rushed towards them.

Yang Zaixuan was someone who had gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate.

And Su Rou, herself, had gone through the seventh level.

As for Su Lie, on the surface, his strength was equal to a warrior who went through the seventh level.

“Bang! Bang!”

Two deep crashes sounded and the figures of Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou were both knocked backwards.

They were knocked back forcefully, it was not because they moved backwards.

The next moment, Su Lie struck out with his fist again. This fist smashed directly toward Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang quickly lifted his sword and executed the Reincarnation Sword Skill with his full power in an attempt to parry it.

“Bang!”

A terrifying power arrived. The force was more than Jian Wushuang could parry, even with the Reincarnation Sword Skill. Subsequently, the figure of Jian Wushuang was sent flying back under that terrifying force, smashing onto the ground behind him.

Silence!

Everyone at the Martial Arts Practice Field looked startled. The only emerging voice was from disciples of Dragon Palace swallowing their saliva.

“Fearsome!”

Similar words echoed in everyone’s mind.

It was indeed terrifying. In only a flash, Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were defeated without any room to even struggle.

“So strong!” Jian Wushuang slowly rose to his feet and wiped the blood from his lips, but there was a trace of shock in his eyes.

“His Cultivation of Spiritual Power absolutely reaches the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Not only that, his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is far higher than mine!” Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

“I have gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. But based on his attack, I know that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is definitely higher than mine.” Yang Zaixuan had a serious look on his face.

“You two.” Su Lie clasped his hands and looked at Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan. “A word of advice, as rookies, you better keep a low profile. Dragon Palace is not as simple as you think. What you are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg.”

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were both startled.

What they had seen of Dragon Palace so far was only the tip of the iceberg!

Su Lie was too lazy to explain any more and he wanted to leave. But, after only taking two steps, he stopped suddenly. He looked to the side, smiled, and said, “Bai Cheng, you have been watching for so long. Have you seen enough? If you are itching for a fight, I don’t mind playing with you.”
