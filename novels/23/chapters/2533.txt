Chapter 2534: A Special Gamble

“As a newcomer in the Northern Darkstar Continent, my first step is to find my footing followed by finding ways to obtain more Primordial Stones and upgrading my cultivation level and abilities. Once I have absolute confidence, only then will I plan on challenging the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.” Jian Wushuang squinted slightly and looked over at Xiao Tiexin.

“Tiexin, you’re familiar with this place. Do you know how I could obtain a large sum of Primordial Stones in a short time?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The fastest way to obtain Primordial Stones is becoming a territorial lord. First and foremost, Mr. Jian Yi has great potential, but still quite a distance from being able to challenge the Territorial Lord,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes at Xiao Tiexin and signaled her to say something more useful.

“Other than becoming a Territorial Lord, you can also provoke the Northern Darkstar Continent clans as even the weakest clan would have huge savings, but as I’ve said before that those low-tier clans do have their strengths and especially their networks. If you’re planning on getting Primordial Stones by annihilating the clans individually as you did back in the Dark Thunder Territory, I’m afraid it’s not so easy,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang shrugged.

He currently could not butt head-on against those clans due to his lack of abilities. Even if he did, he would not annihilate an entire clan with no good reason except for obtaining some Primordial Stones.

Those clans were different from the Dark Thunder Territory’s Eighteen Prefectures after all. The Prefectures were thieves, murderers, and smugglers, hence he was not bothered at all when killing them.

“If you don’t have the heart to deal with these clans, then the only place to get a large sum of Primordial Stones within a short time would be the Gladiatorial Arena—Gamble-Fight! I know of a very large gladiatorial arena in North Darkstar Continent owned by the Shi clan—one of the three top-tier clans. In the arena, participants could carry out gamble-fights. Furthermore, there is a special gamble-fights method in the arena which is the Blood Gladiator Challenge!” Xiao Tiexin solemnly said.

“Blood Gladiator Challenge, what’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Xiao Tiexin smiled and explained, “Mr. Jian Yi, there would be a limit to bets placed in regular gamble-fights as you might know. It’s the same in the Shi clan’s arena. The upper limit is a thousand Primordial Stones at max. Therefore, if you want to obtain ten thousand Primordial Stones in one go, you would have to win ten consecutive gamble-fights. In addition, the arena’s management will lower the odds upon noticing your excessively strong abilities which will allow you to win with certainty. This will then make it even harder to obtain those ten thousand Primordial Stones.”

However, challenging Blood Gladiators is completely different as the bet’s upper limit which can be placed on a Blood Gladiator is five thousand Primordial Stones not to mention those bets could be constantly accumulated. For example, if you brought five thousand Primordial Stones to a gamble-fight and win a game, the next game’s bet will be ten thousand, and winning that game will yield you twenty thousand which can then be accumulated for the next round and so on. This is the only way you could win many Primordial Stones in one go at the arena.”

However, the condition is that you must first win five consecutive games before you can stop when taking up the Blood Gladiators challenge. It’s without the need to mention that the arena will pick your opponents who won’t be too ridiculous as they will pick someone close to your standards. For example, the five opponents you’ll go against are going to be Primary-Level Ultimate Gods and there won’t be any High-Level Ultimate Gods appearing if Mr. Jian Yi is to challenge the Blood Gladiators.”

“Understood,” answered Jian Wushuang.

The bet’s upper limit could reach 5,000 Primordial Stones when taking up the Blood Gladiators challenge with his winnings being doubled at every round. However, he had to finish five games before he could leave. If he lost even one of the five games, not only would he lose all his bets, he might even lose his life.

“I’m afraid that the arena would pick my next opponents according to my performance in the five gamble-fights. They would probably send mighty similar level experts to defeat me and make it difficult for me to leave with the Primordial Stones I’ve won. Therefore, I’m afraid it won’t be so easy to win those five games,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Indeed. The Blood Gladiators challenge is not for just about anyone and neither could everyone hold themselves together for their five games. The Gladiatorial Arena won’t easily allow you to bring home your winnings, hence many tried challenging those Blood Gladiators and usually could only win two to three gamble-fights before losing their lives in the end,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“It’s no doubt that one’s risk is directly proportional to his final winnings. There have been several challengers who succeeded in the Blood Gladiators challenge. They not only won a huge amount of Primordial Stones but even became very famous in the end. As far as I know, there’s a Peak Ultimate God General in the Territorial Lord’s Official Army who succeeded in the arena’s Blood Gladiators challenge.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you’re a genius in every aspect and can already easily kill High-Level Ultimate Gods while being at the Primary-Level Ultimate God. You even managed to safely retreat when facing a Peak Ultimate God. Winning five games shouldn’t be a problem if you do indeed take up the arena’s Blood Gladiators challenge. As for Primordial Stones... your total winnings would be a hundred and sixty thousand pieces if you placed a bet of five thousand Primordial Stones followed by winning five consecutive games!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang felt tempted when he heard that.

He had reached the peak of First-Class Divine Demon and only needed 20,000 to 30,000 Primordial Stones before making a breakthrough to Peak Divine Demon. However, cultivating towards the Ultimate God realm would require even more Primordial Stones once he reached Peak Divine Demon.

160,000 Primordial Stones were not a small figure for Jian Wushuang.

The Blood Gladiator Challenge would most definitely be dangerous and difficult for most people, but it was probably nothing for Jian Wushuang.

“Tiexin, I’ve exhausted all my Primordial Stones obtained at Dark Thunder Territory. You still have six thousand pieces. Lend me five thousand and when I’ve completed the Blood Gladiators challenge, I’ll return you double the amount.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“No problem.” Xiao Tiexin agreed without a second thought.

“In that case, lead the way,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Jian Wushuang headed toward the Shi clan’s gigantic gladiatorial arena with Xiao Tiexin leading the way.

...

The Gladiatorial Arena was incredibly noisy.

There were probably a few hundred thousand people sitting tightly together in the audience seats with many of them hysterically shouting and roaring.

The noises could probably shake the Heavens.

In the arena’s center was a giant battlefield.

Two Peak Divine Demons giving their all and fighting violently on the battlefield as there could only be one survivor.
