Chapter 3725: Cleansing Fire Formation

“Haha, your Palace Master?”

Pupil Master looked at Master Guchi mockingly. “Kid, don’t think that I don’t know anything about this Star Field just because I’ve been traveling alone. I know very well that your palace master didn’t come to the Red Cloud World this time. As for the Temporal Temple Master you mentioned, he’s on the Fourth Continent now. How could he make it here in time?”

“It’s impossible for them to get here. Even if they do, what can they do?”

“I, Eye Master, have ruled this universe for so many years. I’m not even afraid of a senior Ruler. Why would I care about Star Palace Palace Master and Temporal Temple Master? What a joke!”

“Kid, I advise you to stop struggling and give me that top-tier domain type True Treasure and the array you’re using right now. I might spare your life. Otherwise, when I break this array, you’ll die!”

Pupil Master’s words made Master Guchi’s face turn extremely ugly.

He had not expected Pupil Master to be so shameless. Not only had he attacked him, a Principles Master, for a top-tier domain type True Treasure, but now that he had seen the cleansing fire array he had used, he even wanted him to hand over the array as well.

This cleansing fire array was his strongest trump card, and it was also his strongest reliance.

He had gotten this array many years ago when he was adventuring in Quicksand Demon Realm. He had been lucky enough to get it. Over the years, this array had saved his life more than once.

To him, this array was far more important than that top-tier domain type True Treasure.

Now, Pupil Master wanted him to hand over this array as well?

How was that possible?

He would rather die than hand it over!

Now, he could only hope that Blood Sword Master would arrive earlier.

Although he did not know Jian Wushuang’s true strength, judging from his position in Star Palace and the attitudes of Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, and the others toward him, Jian Wushuang was not much weaker than the Ruler, the difference was not too great.

As long as he arrived and joined hands with him, he should be able to stop Pupil Master.

“Humph, you’re so stubborn. Since you don’t want to hand it over, then die.”

Pupil Master’s voice was cold, and the terrifying blood cloud rolled. It rushed toward the pure white sea of fire crazily with a shocking power. Master Guchi could only rely on the magic formation to resist it. However, as Pupil Master’s true strength erupted, his pressure naturally increased sharply.

As time passed, it became more and more difficult for him to resist it. The fire-cleansing magic formation gradually reached its limit.

“Damn it, why isn’t Blood Sword Master here yet?”

Master Guchi’s face was completely distorted. He could already sense that the fire-cleansing formation could not hold on any longer. He could only grit his teeth and continue to resist, praying that Jian Wushuang would arrive earlier.

However, they were 50 million miles away. Even if Jian Wushuang rushed at full speed, it would still take some time.

There were many Principles Masters gathered in the void around the pure white fire sea.

Many of them had participated in the fight for the top-tier domain type True Treasure. Some of them had sensed the huge commotion and rushed over.

These Principles Masters stood in the void around the fire-cleansing formation and watched the scene from afar. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When they saw that Master Guchi had been pushed to his limit by Pupil Master, many Principles Masters could not help but sigh.

“This Master Guchi is already extremely powerful, and he has a life-saving trump card like the cleansing fire formation. Logically speaking, he should be able to do as he pleases as long as he doesn’t run into a Ruler. I didn’t expect his luck to be so bad. He just so happened to run into a Ruler, and it was this Pupil Master who didn’t care about his status at all.”

“This Master Guchi is really unlucky. We all know Eye Master’s temper and personality. Anyone who is targeted by him will have a headache.”

“There’s nothing we can do. Unless this Master Guchi hands over that top-tier domain type True Treasure and his purifying fire array, he’ll probably die!”

“That top-tier domain type True Treasure is still fine. Anyway, he just got it. Just take it as bad luck and hand it over. The problem is that Eye Master is still interested in his purifying fire array. Everyone knows that this purifying fire array is Master Guchi’s strongest trump card. Why would Master Guchi hand over such a treasure?”

“You’re right. If it were me, I wouldn’t hand it over either.”

Many Principles Masters were discussing among themselves. Most of them sympathized with Master Guchi and felt that he was unlucky.

As time passed, the spectators could clearly feel that Master Guchi could not hold on any longer.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was still more than 20 million miles away from the void. It would take him a while to arrive.

“Haha, boy, you can’t hold on any longer, can you?”

Wanton laughter echoed in the world. Rumble! The world shook and endless power burst out, shattering the pure white sea of fire that covered tens of thousands of miles on the battlefield, the sea of fire finally could not withstand the impact of the terrifying power and dissipated directly.

The fire cleansing formation of Master Guchi was directly destroyed by Eye Master.

Without the obstruction of the fire cleansing formation, with Master Guchi’s strength, he would not be able to face Eye Master head-on.

When they realized this, many people around them secretly sighed. Even Master Guchi himself let out a miserable laugh, a trace of despair in his eyes.

However, just as Eye Master was about to attack and directly kill Master Guchi, a human figure had unknowingly appeared around this area of the void.

“It’s quite lively here.”

A low chuckle with a hint of playfulness sounded in the area.

This low chuckle attracted the attention of everyone present. Even Pupil Master, who was about to make a move, stopped what he was doing and looked at the person.

When he saw the person’s appearance clearly, Pupil Master could not help but frown.

The person was a strange old man with a scarlet cape. The old man had a thin face and a hooked nose. His eyes were very small, like those of a mouse. He even narrowed his eyes slightly, giving off an extremely shrewd look, the teasing smile on the old man’s lips made his entire person appear a little more evil.

The aura on this strange old man’s body was actually not very strong. It was very obvious that he was only at the level of a Principles Master.

However, they were both Principles Masters. Pupil Master did not put that Master Guchi in his eyes at all. However, when he saw this strange old man, Pupil Master frowned slightly.

“Dark Bone! It’s Elder Dark Bone!”

“Among the Principles Masters in this Star Field, Elder Dark Bone is said to have the most skills and the strongest survival ability!”

“It’s him?”

The Principles Masters around the battlefield were all shocked when they saw this weird old man.
