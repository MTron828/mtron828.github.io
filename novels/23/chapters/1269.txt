Chapter 1270: Chant of Disturbance

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Universe God Qian Luan departed, Jian Wushuang was the only one left in the chamber.

He sat down directly with his legs crossed, released his Soul Power and started meditating on the skill hidden behind the words “Yan Jiu”.

Though he did not know the concept of the skills yet, he felt he could gain a lot from its essence.

“This skill is obviously powerful, but why do I get this feeling that it is also very swift?”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and devoted himself to the meditation of the sword’s skills.

At the same time, he also tried to figure out the shortcomings of his own swordsmanship.

Time went by…

On an uninhabited island, not far from Leopard-print Island, there was a gathering of many cultivators.

There were two men there who were clearly the leaders.

The duo’s roaring auras showed that they were Universe Gods. Standing side by side, they looked at the void in front of them, obviously waiting for something.

Before long, a black figure appeared in the distance.

“Here he comes.”

One of the leaders was a man over two meters tall and wearing a body armor. He grinned when he saw the black figure. Beside him was a good-looking young man, whose face looked pale. The young man’s eyes sparkled as well when he saw the figure.

Woosh!

The figure, dressed in a black robe, appeared on the island, where the two were waiting.

“Mr. Zhuge.”

The two men saluted the newcomer. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Your presence is very welcome here.” An old voice came forth from the black robe. “This time, I came to help you, under my master’s order, but he also told me that I’d better not have a hand in your affairs unless it’s necessary. It is best for our Holy Prefecture to stay out of the raging battle between Scarlet Island and Golden-sun Sect now.”

“We understand, Mr. Zhuge.” The young man answered with a smile. “Before you arrived, I’ve confirmed that there is only one Universe God named Qian Luan on Leopard-print Island. She is in the First Heaven and I can hold off her on my own. With the two of us here, we can certainly take over the island.

“The reason why we asked you for help was just to be a backup. After all, such a large Leopard-print Gem mine must be really worth a lot.”

“So much the better.” The black-robed man nodded. “It seems that Scarlet Island hasn’t gained any advantage over Golden-sun Sect yet. Otherwise, they would have more than one Universe God to guard the island. When do you guys plan to start your action?”

“We’re ready, Mr. Zhuge. Since you are here, let’s go now,” the young man replied.

“Great.” The black-robed man nodded slightly.

Immediately, thee experts from Xiu State headed to Leopard-print Island, with the tall man in armor and the young man, leading the way. As for Mr. Zhuge, he set off with them but kept his presence hidden.

Boom!

As soon as the army of Xiu State arrived on the Leopard-print Island, their aura immediately oppressed the whole place.

Jian Wushaung was still in the secret chamber in the core place of Leopard-print Gem Mine.

Weng!

A cold sword light flashed in the room like a meteor; it seemed to have a sword chant in it. This quickly died away.

Jian Wushuang stood with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand, with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. He stared at the two words in the cyan stone.

“Yan Jiu… I want to thank you!”

“You might not have left those words here on purpose, but it still inspired me a lot. I have meditated on it for ten days in this room. Using that and the Spell of Disturbance, I have created a new skill.”

Jian Wushuang murmured joyfully.

Before he entered the room, he had only created two unique skills for himself—Dawn Light and Nirvana.

Now, based on Spell of Disturbance, he created the third one.

This new skill was aimed at improving his attacking speed and was a perfect combination of speed and Soul Attack. It was a real Killing Move.

The difference was that the Spell of Disturbance was able to display dozens of moves or even hundreds of moves without pausing. There was a Soul Attack behind each of the moves; even though there was only one move in the new skill, the Soul Attack behind it was much more powerful.

The new skill could exert the power of the Soul Attack to the fullest.

“What should I name this skill? Since it’s created based on Spell of Disturbance and there is a chant of the sword in it, let me call it Chant of Disturbance then.”?Jian Wushuang smiled as he named his new skill.

His third unique skill—Chant of Disturbance was thus created, following the previous two moves—the Stroke of Dawn and Nirvana.

Like the two previous skills, the new skill was also of a high level.

At this level, Nirvana was powerful in attacking while Chant of Disturbance was very strange and fast!

Although this new skill would not increase Jian Wushuang’s overall power, it could help him have a better chance to defeat his opponents in a fight.

Right then…

Boom!

He felt a strong aura overwhelming the entire island.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked up.

“Jian Wushuang, come out quickly, the experts of Xiu kingdom have arrived,” Universe God Qian Luan summoned Jian Wushuang urgently.

“They have arrived?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up and his heart was filled with anticipation.

“I have set foot on the Eternal Chaotic World for so long, but I have never had the chance to go all out to fight. Now, the experts of Xiu State have come… I hope I can go all out and make good use of my skills..

Jian Wushuang immediately rushed out of the secret chamber to the void above Leopard-print Island.

The arrival of the experts of Xiu State caused a great commotion on the whole island. A large number of Universe Masters and Holy Masters who were guarding the island reached its edge.

Outside the island, there were also a large number of experts gathered.

“Are all these experts from Xiu kingdom?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, staring at the crowds gathered nearby.

The number of Universe Masters and Holy Masters present from Xiu State were no larger than that on Leopard-print Island; There were two towering figures with unusually strong auras, standing in front of the crowd. Obviously, these two were Universe Gods.

However, there was only one Universe God on Scarlet Island’s side.

In view of this, Scarlet Island seemed to be the weaker opponent.
