Chapter 1030: Hope

“Great! Ding Mo is not only the Elder of the Samsara Temple but also an overlord who governs such a large city.”

After strolling around the Emperor Heart City for a while and admiring the prosperity of the city in his heart, Jian Wushuang went directly to the Governor Mansion to visit Ding Mo.

However, he was stopped by two guards in front of the mansion.

“I am introduced by the Heaven-level Law Executor Dao Master Dreamless of the Samsara Temple. I ask to see Elder Ding Mo for something urgent. This is the token Dao Master Dreamless gave me. Please report my request to Elder Ding Mo.” Jian Wushuang took out the token and handed it to one of the guards.

The two guards looked at each other. They served as Ding Mo’s guards a long time ago and naturally heard of Dao Master Dreamless. Meanwhile, they knew he had a good relationship with their Governor.

After knowing that this man was introduced by Dao Master Dreamless, they did not dare to neglect him and one of them immediately informed their Governer of his arrival.

A moment later, the guard who went into the mansion to send the message came out and said, “Your Excellency, our Governor is waiting for you.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Previously, Dao Master Dreamless told him that Ding Mo was odd and he would meet him but not necessarily immediately. Now, however, that did not seem to be the case.

Following that guard, he walked into the Governor Mansion and soon came to a lofty hall.

The hall was fairly grand. When he entered it, he saw a white-robed elder sitting at the highest place in the hall.

Noticing his arrival, the white-robed elder opened his eyes and asked the guard to leave with a motion of his hand. At the same time, a layer of immaterial Restriction rose around the hall and covered the entire hall within.

Thus, there were only Jian Wushuang and the white-robed elder in this enormous hall.

“Jian Wushuang, Empyrean Patriarch is tracking you crazily and all the forces and populations on the Samsara Continent are desperately finding your whereabouts in order to obtain 20 Chaos Gems. Normal people have already found a place to hide at this critical moment, however, you came here to find me publicly.” Ding Mo said, wearing a meaningful smile.

Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “Dao Master Dreamless informed you of my identity, right?”

“Dao Master Dreamless? He just told me that an Eternal Realm expert would visit me with his token but didn’t mention your name. Nonetheless, he is arrogant and has no junior or disciple. How could he assist an ordinary Eternal Realm expert? Besides, I know he was on a mission to the Rock Demon Clan not long ago. So long as I think about all this carefully, I can figure out your identity.” Ding Mo said casually.

Hearing his words, Jian Wushuang laughed helplessly. “Right, I’m Jian Wushuang. I wonder whether Elder Ding Mo will send this message to Empyrean Patriarch for the 20 Chaos Gems?”

Ding Mo narrowed his eyes and overlooked Jian Wushuang, only to discover that he was calm and composed as before.

He burst out laughing and said, “No wonder Dao Master Dreamless thinks highly of you. Not to mention your talent and strength, your composure alone is rarely seen.”

“You have my assurance. Although 20 Chaos Gems are something of great value and I am tempted by them too, I will never plot against the man that Dao Master Dreamless recommended to me for them.”

“Many thanks.” Jian Wushuang replied calmly.

“Take a seat.” Ding Mo waved his hand and a chair appeared out of blue behind Jian Wushuang. Moreover, a long narrow table with wine and food on it emerged in front of Jian Wushuang as well.

Jian Wushuang sat down and took a sip of wine.

“Dao Master Dreamless has messaged me your request. Although it is troublesome, it’s not something difficult for me.” Ding Mo chuckled and stared at Jian Wushuang. “What’s your relative’s name?”

“His name is Jian Nantian. He became the Reincarnator in the Ancient World 2,000 years ago.” Jian Wushuang replied hurriedly.

“Fine. I’ll check it for you immediately, but it will take about half a month.” Ding Mo said.

“Half a month? Why will it take so long?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Ding Mo glanced at Jian Wushuang and said, “Dao Master Dreamless told me that you have asked a Gold-clothed Deacon to look up the information about your relative, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“If I am right, did that Gold-clothed Deacon reply you soon?” Ding Mo looked at Jian Wushuang smilingly.

“Yes, he provided me with the result in three days.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Haha, I knew it.” Ding Mo laughed. “Dao Master Dreamless told me the things happened between you and that Gold-clothed Deacon. The Gold-clothed Deacon went through the motions just in order to acquire your reward.”

“Went through the motions?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell. “Did Jin Yu never look it up for me?”

“I didn’t mean that.” Ding Mo shook his head. “He checked the information simply according to the name you gave him and replied you after he failed to find your relative’s name. In fact, in the Samsara Temple, Reincarnators usually take code names for the sake of convenience and concealment. Their code names are a must if anyone wants to look up their information. Their real names are ignored instead.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“So, if Jin Yu really wanted to aid you, he would look up the information according to your relative’s origin and the time he has become a Reincarnator. Only in this way can he receive an exact result.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang replied in shock.

“Jian Wushuang, since you are introduced by Dao Master Dreamless and I admire your talent and composure, I will wholeheartedly find out the whereabouts of your loved one for you. Therefore, it will take more time to do that. You should know that I’ve tried my best to shorten the time to half a month.” Ding Mo said.

“Many thanks to Elder Ding Mo for doing all this for me.” Jian Wushuang said sincerely.

“Haha, nothing. If you have nothing to do during this period, just stay here temporarily. I’ll inform you of the result half a month later.” Ding Mo waved his hand and then left with a quick move.

Jian Wushuang alone stood there and clenched his fists. What Ding Mo just said thrilled him.

“According to what Elder Ding Mo has said, Jin Yu just checked the information of Reincarnators perfunctorily. That means chances are that my father is a Reincarnator below Rank Seven and Jin Yu just failed to find him.”

“So my father is probably alive!”
