Chapter 4044: Thunder Star Lord’s Wealth

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The Star Lord is dead?”

“How is that possible? The Star Lord is a fifth-level Ruler. How could he die at the hands of a second-level Ruler?”

“Impossible, this is impossible!”

The experts of Thunder Star Lord felt like they were going crazy.

Over the long years, the Thunder Star Lord had always been an invincible existence in the Thunder Star Lord’s place. Even in the entire Purple Micro Galaxy, he was still an expert who stood at the top of the pyramid.

!!

Such an expert was already invincible in a medium-sized Star Field.

Even the Thunder Star Lord himself had once said that he was fearless in the Purple Micro Galaxy. From this, one could see his strength.

And that was indeed the case. Over the long years, the Thunder Star Lord had always given people the feeling of invincibility. Whether it was in the Thunder Star Field or in the battles with the other experts of the Star Field, the Thunder Star Lord had always been incomparably powerful.

It was precisely because of this that in the hearts of these experts of the Thunder Star Field, they had long been almost blindly worshipping the Thunder Star Lord. But today, they had never imagined that the Thunder Star Lord would actually die.

He was killed by a second-level Ruler in front of everyone.

Shock, fear, and disbelief appeared in everyone’s minds,

Jian Wushuang had already waved his hand and put the treasures left by the Thunder Star Lord into his interspatial ring. Then, he looked at the Sect Master of the Universal Poison Demon Sect with interest.

“Not good.” The Sect Master of the Universal Poison Demon Sect was like a frightened bird. As soon as he sensed Jian Wushuang’s gaze, he immediately retreated without hesitation, desperately trying to distance himself from Jian Wushuang.

He knew very well that it was Thunder Lord who had begged him to deal with Jian Wushuang. He wanted to use Thunder Lord to kill Jian Wushuang. Even if he could not kill Jian Wushuang, he had to punish him properly.

Who would have thought that not only did Thunder Star Lord fail to kill Jian Wushuang, but he was killed instead.

So now, could Jian Wushuang spare him? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Shuang ‘er, let’s go.”

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang did not attack the Sect Master of the Universal Poison Demon Sect. Instead, he called his wife and Devil Flame and left the Universal Poison Demon Sect.

To Jian Wushuang, the Sect Master of the Universal Poison Demon Sect was nothing in his eyes. It did not matter whether he killed him or not. However, because Leng Rushuang had already said that the enmity between him and Leng Ruxue was over…Jian Wushuang did not intend to have any contact with Leng Ruxue in the future, and Leng Ruxue was from the Universal Poison Demon Sect. Therefore, Jian Wushuang spared her life.

Under the gaze of countless experts, Jian Wushuang and the other two left the Universal Poison Demon Sect and soon disappeared into the horizon.

The martial arts practice field was already in an uproar.

In the camp of the Universal Poison Demon Sect, the experts of the Universal Poison Demon Sect were all shocked. Among the crowd, Leng Ruxue gritted her teeth and looked in the direction where Jian Wushuang and the other two had left.

“Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect you to be so strong after so many years. You even killed Star Lord!”

“And that bitch, she has been sleeping for so many years, but her strength is even stronger than mine!”

Leng Ruxue clenched her hands and her eyes were cold.

“Just you wait. You are stronger than me now, but it won’t be long before I surpass you. I will!”

Leng Ruxue had already regarded Leng Rushuang and Jian Wushuang as her targets.

However, what Leng Ruxue did not know was that both Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang had a much greater innate advantage than him.

Needless to say, Jian Wushuang was not only at the perfect life level, but also possessed an astral world. He had unlimited potential.

Leng Rushuang had also fused with the heart of the astral world. Her innate advantage was definitely greater than her body of woe poison.

Just now, Leng Ruxue was already inferior to the two of them. In the future, the gap would only be greater.

Moreover, they probably would not have the chance to meet again in the future.

…

After leaving the Universal Poison Demon Sect, Jian Wushuang and the others had finished their business in the Purple Micro Galaxy. Naturally, they did not stay any longer and quickly left the Thunder Star World.

In the universe void of the Purple Micro Star Road, the ancient universe boat slowly moved forward.

In the universe boat, Jian Wushuang was examining the treasures and interspatial rings left behind by the Thunder Star Lord after his death.

“He is indeed a second-class astral world Ruler of a medium-sized Star Field. His wealth is much more than that of the Devil Cloud Star Lord. Even compared to Nine Whiskers, the Ascetic Cultivator we met in the Purple Micro Star River, Nine Whiskers’s wealth is far inferior to that of the Thunder Star Lord if it were not for the venom,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Nine Whiskers was an Ascetic Cultivator, and he had been to many territories and killed many great beings. He had even killed a fifth-level Ruler, so he had an extraordinary family background. Of course, the most precious thing was the venom that he had gotten back then.

Putting aside the venom, Nine Whiskers’s total was probably less than 4,000 universe primitives.

However, Thunder Star Lord had almost 4,000 origin stones in his universe ring.

In addition to all kinds of valuable resources and the green spear used by Thunder Star Lord himself, the Green Spear should be a mid-grade Principle True Treasure, and its value was also very high.

All of these added up, Thunder Star Lord’s total wealth should be close to 8,000 universe origin stones.

His wealth was already close to that of an ultimate level Ruler.

“It’s already impressive for an ordinary fifth-level Ruler to be worth 1,000 to 2,000 universe origin stones. However, Thunder Star Lord is a Ruler of a second-level astral world and has been staying in the Purple Micro Galaxy for a long time. He’s at the top, so it’s easy for him to plunder treasures. It’s normal for him to be so rich,” Devil Flame said with a sigh.

Jian Wushuang also nodded slightly. As a fifth-level Ruler and a second-level star world Ruler in a medium-sized Star Field, if he was good at collecting money, he could indeed accumulate a lot of universe origin stones over a long period of time.

If it were other fifth-level Rulers, they definitely would not have such wealth.

Of course, no matter how good he was at collecting money, he could not be compared with an ultimate level Ruler.

Jian Wushuang had heard from Devil Flame that an Ultimate Ruler, even if he was relatively poor, would have tens of thousands of universe origin stones, and the stronger ones would have hundreds of thousands of universe origin stones, as for the Ultimate Ruler, he could easily get more than one million universe origin stones.

Compared to those Ultimate Rulers, the amount of universe origin stones Jian Wushuang got was just a drop in the bucket.

“I got a lot of source stones when I killed Nine Whiskers. Now that I killed Thunder Star Lord, I got more. I don’t need these source stones for now, but I can buy you a suitable nomological true treasure armor,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.
