Chapter 787: Hearts are Bleeding!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After the experts on the scene all heard Xuan Yi out and caught the view of his indignant face, they came to understand his first requirement.

Indeed, if Xuan Yi was telling the truth, the fee for his three disciples using the wormhole was already as high as 600 million Divine Gems. Then, it would seem quite reasonable that Xuan Yi intended to seek compensation of a billion Divine Gems from the three magnates.

Jian Wushuang cast an odd look at Xuan Yi, and then, wheeled around to look at his Senior Brother Bai Hu. Gingerly, he asked, “Third Senior Brother, did you three really come here through wormholes?”

“Of course.” Bai Hu nodded gravely. “If it hadn’t been for the wormholes in the Void Temple, how could I have bustled here from the remote Ice Water Territory after receiving Master’s call?”

“So is the fee for using wormholes really that expensive?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Bai Hu nodded again. “The Void Temple is the real overlord of the Eternal World. It owns all the wormholes leading to every corner of the Eternal World. Using wormholes is indeed pricey. Each use will cost you 100 million Divine Gems, just like Master said. However, there is one thing Master didn’t mention.”

“What’s it?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him hastily.

He laughed mischievously. “Our First Senior Brother is one of the 18 masters of the Void Temple. He has quite an influence in the Void Temple. So, he not only paid nothing for using a wormhole of the Void Temple but also gave each of us one token. With this token, each person is allowed to use wormholes at one-tenth of the normal price.”

“That’s to say, each time Second Senior Brother and I use a wormhole it only costs 10 million Divine Gems per person. For a round trip, it amounts to 40 million Divine Gems for both of us. That’s much lower than the 600 million that Master just told them,” Bai Hu said, beaming.

“So this is the truth?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. In spite of himself, he looked at his First Senior Brother Xue Lingtian.

“One of the 18 masters of the Void Temple?”

For the moment, Jian Wushuang was not clear about the power of the Void Temple. Nor did he have any concrete idea about the influence of the 18 masters in the Void Temple. But Jian Wushuang could tell that his First Senior Brother was definitely an awesome figure, an absolute top expert in the Eternal World.

“Junior Brother, when we get back to the Ancient Sect, you can go to your First Senior Brother and ask him to give you a token. With the wormholes of the Void Temple, it’ll be much more convenient for you to travel around the Eternal World. Otherwise, if each use of a wormhole costs 100 million Divine Gems, even an extremely powerful Dao Master cannot afford it,” Bai Hu suggested.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded gently.

From Bai Hu’s account, he knew the token must be highly useful. If he could, he wanted to ask Xue Lingtian for such a token.

On the other side of the Void, Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su all pulled a long face at Xuan Yi’s words. Nevertheless, in light of the astonishing strength that Xue Lingtian had just demonstrated, the three could only choke down their anger.

“Fine, we’ll give you a billion Divine Gems. It’s a deal.” Tian Yunzi nodded forcefully, his face a little abashed.

“Well, great, no problem about the first requirement. Now, I’ll tell you my second request.”

Xuan Yi smiled blandly and went on, “As you know, I’m a highly skilled expert in many fields, such as making puppets, refining weapons, and concocting elixirs. Recently, I’ve been wanting to refine a magic weapon and really need a kind of gem called Orichalcum. And I need quite a lot. You three, please try to get some for me, will you?”

“Orichalcum?” Tian Yunzi and the other two were astonished.

They all had heard of Orichalcum. It was an extremely rare and precious ore.

The reason for its rarity was that this kind of ore allegedly came from other planets in the universe, and could only be found there. The Eternal World had no naturally formed Orichalcum.

Considering its rarity, its value was naturally exorbitant.

In the market of the Eternal World, a nail-sized piece of Orichalcum would be worth millions of Divine Gems.

Although the three magnates all stored some of this ore, the quantity was miserably small.

“Xuan Yi, how much Orichalcum are you talking about?” Tian Yunzi asked with a snort.

“Not much. I need five kilograms. So, each of you will only hand in a little more than three kilograms.” Xuan Yi smiled.

Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su gave another shudder.

A pile of five kilograms of the Orichalcum would be as large as a baby’s fist. Its value would be no less than 100 million Divine Gems.

And above all, this kind of treasure was not something money could buy. Without special channels to the outside, it was impossible to get one’s hands on it.

“OK, we accept.”

Tian Yunzi and the other two nodded after a short discussion.

But as they made this promise, their hearts all bled with despair!

“Good, excellent. Such being the case, I have one last requirement left.” Xuan Yi spoke again. “The last thing I’m asking for is not that hard for you to get. I just want some Secret Skills.”

“Secret Skills?” Tian Yunzi and the other two looked stunned.

The experts around also started murmuring.

“First he asks for Divine Gems, and then the Natural Treasures, and now the Secret Skills of the three magnates! Wow, this Palace Master Xuan Yi is really relentless!”

“Humph, Palace Master Xuan Yi is not the one to blame. The three magnates asked for this.”

“Well, that’s true. Since the three magnates sent out so many experts together to take on Jian Wushuang, a Divine Realm expert, it’s no wonder Palace Master Xuan Yi got so furious.”

“This time, the three magnates will really suffer a lot.”

Surrounded by all the murmuring, Tian Yunzi clenched his teeth and said, “Just say it, which Secret Skills do you want?”

“Not many, only 10 Secret Skills from each of you. I have listed the details of these Secret Skills. Here is the list. You can take it and have a look.” Xuan Yi immediately threw a list over.

The three caught the list and looked through it. Their expressions changed several times as they read it.

Each of the Secret Skills that Xuan Yi listed was rather precious and unique. They were all devised by their predecessors after pouring in a lot of time and a great effort. Each of them was highly meaningful to their sects. But now, Xuan Yi required them to give him 30 Secret Skills in total.

How could they not be shocked and devastated!

But no matter how devastated they were, they had to stay rational. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After a moment of contemplation, Tian Yunzi nodded forcefully. He stared at Xuan Yi, gritted his teeth and said, “In three days, we’ll send the Divine Gems, the Orichalcum, and all the Secret Skills you asked for to your Ancient Sect.”

“Great. If you keep your promise, I will pretend that this whole thing never happened, and we can still be friends. But if you fail to send those things to me promptly, I will have to send my disciples to you for a visit,” Xuan Yi said with a smile.

Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su looked completely sullen.

Tian Yunzi was also screaming hysterically in this mind, “Friend? What kind fu*king friend are you?”

“Haha, so it’s settled. My disciples, let’s go back!”
