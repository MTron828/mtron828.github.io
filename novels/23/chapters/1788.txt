“Lord, the Monarch wanted me to give you this token.”

Fen Yue handed a token to Jian Wushuang with respect. “This is the token to control the tenth legion. After the tenth legion has completely destroyed the Tian Jue City, they will be stationed near the Dayu World throughout the year. Hence, by using this token, Lord can mobilize the tenth legion to do anything.”

“Of course, Lord’s abilities are monstrous. In Lord’s hands, the tenth legion will probably be destroyed with a flip of a palm. However, it is impossible for Lord to do everything himself. With the tenth legion showing up on your behalf in the Snow Kingdom, there will be less trouble for you. In addition, you can also give this token to your loved ones or friends. Similarly, they can mobilize the tenth legion as well. Even if you were to leave, with the tenth legion at hand, no one would dare to disrespect your loved ones and friends.”

“For example, it will be impossible for today’s matter, where the great army of the Tian Jue City fought all their way here, to happen again.”

“Understood. Help me to thank the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom for his good intentions by saying that I will accept this token,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and said.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang had accepted the token, Fen Yue became delighted at once. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As for Jian Wushuang, he turned his head to look at a person beside him. “Scarlet Island Master.”

“Lo, Lord,” the Scarlet Island Master said with respect immediately.

Jian Wushuang forced a smile: “I was born in the Scarlet Island and I am also someone from the Bloodline of Scarlet. Hence, you do not need to be so respectful to me.”

“Understood,” the Scarlet Island Master nodded his head. However, his expression was still respectful like before.

With regards to that, Jian Wushuang stopped forcing him, “I am thankful to the Scarlet Island for protecting me back then when I came out from my hometown and was travelling in the Dayu World. Therefore, I shall give you this token now.”

Jian Wushuang tossed the token to the Scarlet Island Master.

Such a scene caused the eyes of quite a number of the surrounding Universe Gods to turn red.

It should be known that the token was the token to control the tenth legion.

With the token on-hand, one would be able to mobilize the whole tenth legion. That was ten thousand Universe Gods. Moreover, they were elites. In addition, they were proficient in group attacks and their formations as well as fighting capabilities were extremely powerful.

For example, the tenth legion could destroy a powerhouse like the Tian Jue City easily.

By being able to control such a powerful force, the power that the Scarlet Island Master possessed surpassed that of the Tian Jue City when it was at its peak instantly.

In the future, even if it were the Dayu Palace Master who was the most powerful person in the Dayu World, he would also need to lower his head when facing the Scarlet Island.

“Oh right. During this period of time, did big brother Fiery King return to the Scarlet Island at all?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He had returned before. However, that was twenty thousand years ago. Moreover, he only stayed for a short period of time. After leaving some resources for the Scarlet Island, he left and continued to travel,” the Scarlet Island Master said at once.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at the surrounding people right away, “Everyone, I am in a rush to return to my hometown to take a look. Hence, I cannot accompany all of you any longer.”

“Lord, please have a safe trip,” Fen Yue saluted immediately and sent him off.

The Dayu Palace Master, Wu Cang, the Scarlet Island Master and the rest of the people looked on with respect as Jian Wushuang and his people left.

After Jian Wushuang and his people were far away, the large number of Universe Gods present heaved a sigh of relief.

Those Universe Gods were looking at each other and they only felt that they were still in their dreams.

“Lord Fen Yue,” Wu Cang spoke with respect carefully.

“Mister Wu Cang, you do not need to be so modest. You can just call me by my name. Otherwise, you can also call me Military Commander,” Fen Yue laughed gently.

He knew that Wu Cang, as well as quite a number of people present, were on good terms with the Lord from before. Although they were not really very close to one another where they were sworn friends, as long as they were on good terms, they were worthy of being treated earnestly by the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom, let alone him.

“Military Commander.” Wu Cang took a deep breath and asked: “What exactly is Jian Wushuang’s current identity? Why are you so respectful of him? Moreover, from the looks of it, even the Monarch is paying a lot of attention to him.”

“Paying attention to him?” Fen Yue laughed, “Mister Wu Cang, you’re wrong. The Monarch is not paying attention to Lord Jian Wushuang. Instead… he is respecting him!”

“Respecting him?” Wu Cang was stunned.

The Dayu Palace Master and his group of people around the area looked over with astonishment.

What kind of existence was the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom? Even with that, he still revered Jian Wushuang?

“Let me tell all of you the truth. The Lord just now has already achieved the level of an Almighty!” Fen Yue said earnestly.

“Almighty??” Everyone was puzzled.

However, Wu Cang and the Dayu Palace Master were dumbfounded.

The two of them had a lot of experience and they knew what an Almighty meant.

It was a supreme existence of the Eternal Chaotic World!

For such a super existence, a Real God would normally kneel down if he were to see them.

Even if it were a Chaotic Real God like the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom, he was merely an ant to an Almighty.

“No wonder. No wonder even the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom would be so fearful and respectful of him. So Jian Wushuang has already become an Almighty?”

“In just tens of thousands of years, the little kid from back then has actually grown to such a level?”

Wu Cang and the Dayu Palace Master were filled with disbelief.

…

After leaving the Dayu Palace, Jian Wushuang rode the spaceship to his hometown, the Green Fire World, immediately.

In the void, which was in complete darkness, an ancient spaceship was moving hastily.

Inside the spaceship’s cabin.

“I’m almost there. I’m almost home!”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists and his expression was obviously filled with excitement.

This caused He Xiu and Qiu Yue, who were at the side, to be extremely surprised.

It was their first time seeing Jian Wushuang so excited. On normal days, Jian Wushuang had never been so excited before, even when he had made a huge breakthrough or achieved some kind of opportunity.

They were totally unable to understand Jian Wushuang’s current feelings.

The Green Fire World was his hometown!

It was his roots!

That place was the very center of his life.

No matter how high his abilities rose to or what place he would go to in the future, all of them would always be incomparable to the Green Fire World.

Moreover, he had left his own hometown for far too long.

It was reckoned to be more than fifty thousand years.

After so many years, Jian Wushuang also had no idea how his hometown was doing.

He had no idea how his parents, his brothers, his loved ones and good friends were doing.

“Just a while more and I will be able to return to see all of you.”

Jian Wushuang murmured as he recalled the memories in his head. In no time, Jian Wushuang came before the vast Spacetime Storm which his hometown, the Green Fire World, was at.

In the spacetime, which was already distorted completely, there was a frightening storm rolling about madly.

Back then when Jian Wushuang had come out of the Green Fire World, he had?been shocked when he saw the Spacetime Storm as he absolutely could not see its edge at all.

However, at that time…

“I am actually unable to see the edge already?”

“It’s too big. This Spacetime Storm is too big.”

“How much distance has it covered? Moreover, how strong is the power it contains?”

Jian Wushuang was filled with shock and his heart twitched continuously.

At that moment, he was a top existence in the Eternal Chaotic World and his name was on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

However, when he saw the Spacetime Storm, he still could not help but have jitters.
