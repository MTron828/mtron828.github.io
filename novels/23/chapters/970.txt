Chapter 971: The Return

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Seeing that Di Jing had run out of the imperial palace, Gu Ji’s eyes lit up as a wave of murderous intent swept over him. He charged mercilessly at Di Jing.

“Ha! Di Jing, you’ve yet to recover from the severe injuries I caused you last time! It’d be the death of you today since you dare to come out.” Gu Ji cackled. He knew that it would be difficult to kill Di Jing at the latter’s peak but it was a different story now that Di Jing was severelyinjured.

“Die!” Gu Ji shouted with a cold voice as he thrust his long spear and created a hole in the Void.

“Even if I die, you won’t live well.” Di Jing was infuriated.

For the past 1,000 years, he heard ruthless mockery and scolding from outside the palace day after day. He couldn’t endure it any longer.

He would rather die now as a hero then continue living as a coward in the palace.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The two moved like lightning, creating a big ruckus. The experts from the three big countries, as well as those from Tang of the East, were alerted of this battle.

Numerous experts from Tang of the East appeared above the imperial palace, with Leng Rushuang spearheading them.

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Leng, however, were still resting to recover from their severe injuries.

“Di Jing attacked!”

“Didn’t Emperor Xiao command us not to leave? Why did he still fight?”

“Humph! How can anyone stand being mocked every day? It’s no surprise seeing how hot-tempered Di Jing is!”

“Di Jing was heavily injured in the last battle and had yet to fully recover. To begin with, Dao Master Gu Ji is stronger than him. The result of this battle is likely...”

The experts from Tang of the East were all pessimistic.

Following an explosive noise from the battlefield, Di Jing’s weapon flew out of his hand while the shockwaves threw his body backward. Gu Ji took advantage of the situation and charged ahead, piercing Di Jing’s head.

“Oh no!”

“Hurry! Save him!”

“Save him!”

Blood drained from the faces of the experts from Tang of the East. Leng Rushuang charged forth, leading the rest.

However, there was someone faster than her.

The person didn’t come from within the palace but rather somewhere near the imperial palace.

“Haha! Die, Di Jing!”

Gu Ji had a sinister expression as he left out a cunning laughter. His long spear was already right in front of Di Jing, ready to penetrate his skull.

However, just then, a blood-red Flowing Light entered the battlefield.

A powerful force erupted and blocked Gu Ji’s spear, even sending shockwaves to his body.

“What?”

Gu Ji came to a stop and stared straight ahead.

A young man wearing a blood-red robe stood there calmly, with three quadrangular stars on his mid-brows.

He carried a sword and emitted an Eternal Realm aura that gave Gu Ji a strange feeling and a slight pressure.

“It’s just an insignificant ant in the Eternal Realm. What happened?”?Gu Ji frowned.

Di Jing, who had almost died, opened his eyes wide in bewilderment, staring intensely at the man in front of him.

The man was too familiar to him.

“Hadn’t he died 1,200 years ago?”

“J-Jian...” Di Jing stuttered.

The person turned his head and replied calmly, “Senior Di Jing, please return to the imperial palace.”

Di Jing was shocked but he suppressed his joy. After shooting Gu Ji a sympathetic glance, he turned around and ran.

“Humph! Want to run?” Gu Ji sneered as he didn’t intend on letting Di Jing leave.

It would be ridiculous for him to miss such a good opportunity to kill Di Jing! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Gu Ji took a step forward and closed in for 10 miles. Simultaneously, he clenched his right hand into a fist to throw his spear out, emitting an extraordinary strength that propelled the spear forward. The force, as well as the thunderbolts surrounding the spear, easily pierced through the Void.

Many Dao Masters turned pale upon witnessing his terrifying power.

This move bore Gu Ji’s full power as a top-tier Rank Two master.

The spear charged directly at Di Jing but before it could land on him, the young swordsman inserted himself in front of Gu Ji in an attempt to block the attack.

“How dare you!”

Following Gu Ji’s cold voice, the power of the spear increased again.

“Even a Rank Two master like Di Jing couldn’t block this attack. How can an Eternal Realm expert withstand it?”

Indeed, the red-robed young man was unable to block the spear and it directly hit his chest.

“Clang!”

The noise was akin to metals colliding. After the sound disappeared, all momentum and aura returned back to normal.

Two men stood facing one another in the Void.

Gu Ji remained in the position where he had thrown his spear, while his spear was still on the young man’s body.

However, the spear didn’t even penetrate the young man’s clothes, much less kill him.

The young man stood there calmly. The spear was powerful indeed, but he never backed down too.

“H-How is this possible?”

Gu Ji widened his eyes in bewilderment.

Being a top-tier Rank Two Dao Master, it was ridiculous that he failed to even penetrate the clothes of someone from the Eternal Realm with his spear, especially since he had used his full force.

“Is this a joke?”

“H-He...”?Gu Ji stared intensely at the young man as an idea popped up in his head.

Even though he was only from the Eternal Realm, there could only be one Sword Principle cultivator with such power.

“He must be...”?Staring at the red-robed young man, Gu Ji’s surprise turned into astonishment.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“You’re Jian Wushuang!”

His shriek shook the entire imperial palace.

A mysterious smile crept up on the young man’s face.

His crisp laughter then resounded in the air.

“Let me introduce myself...”

“I’m the Emperor’s son-in-law of the Great Tang... Jian Wushuang!”
