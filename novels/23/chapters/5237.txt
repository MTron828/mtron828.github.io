Chapter 5241 - 5241: The Battle for Position

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Inside, there was a set of peak-level treasures, more than enough for MO Long to use.

For Jian Wushuang, these treasures offered no assistance; if given, they were simply given. He wasn‚Äôt altruistic or compassionate; he just wanted to give MO Long an opportunity.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the eastern city wall and noticed that Dao Lord Si Tian was recruiting some peak-level Grand Yan Immortals.

Sensing someone‚Äôs gaze, Dao Lord Si Tian looked back, a smirk playing on his lips.

The two men stared at each other from a distance. Other powerful beings also sensed that something was amiss between them. The Grand Yan Immortals, who had been recruited earlier, dared not join any faction now.

From the beginning, Jian Wushuang hadn‚Äôt regarded Dao Lord Si Tian as a worthy opponent. However, Dao Lord Si Tian exuded an ancient aura, similar to the Beast God‚Äôs Eye. Moreover, it seemed that Dao Lord Si Tian had set his sights on Jian Wushuangs Beast God‚Äôs Eye.

A few years ago, MO Long had mentioned that he was injured because of Dao Lord Si Tian. MO Long had managed to escape, but was nearly killed by Dao Lord Si Tian in the end.

Now Jian Wushuang understood. It turned out that Dao Lord Si Tian had his eyes on the treasures Jian Wushuang possessed.

With a dark aura in his eyes, Si Tian wanted the Beast God‚Äôs Eye, and Jian Wushuang wanted to understand where Si Tian‚Äôs ancient aura came from.

Their intense gaze met, but in an instant, they separated.

As for recruiting people, he naturally couldn‚Äôt compete with Si Tian. After all, Si Tian was an experienced Dao Lord. However, recruiting people alone wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

The rules for defending the city were clear.

They needed a commander, five chief generals, and ten generals.

These positions would enhance their own abilities. For example, if Jian Wushuang killed 100,000 Nine Revolutions Devouring Demon Lords, he would gain 10,000 treasure points. If he held the position of a chief general, he would earn 15,000 treasure points.

Chief generals had a 30 percent increase in points.

Generals only had a 10 percent increase.

The position of commander was naturally very tempting, but everything depended on strength. The commander wasn‚Äôt chosen; the commander had to be powerful enough to claim the position.

These three days were their final preparation time. Next, the Devouring

Demon Lords would attack the city, with only one hour between each wave.

During this hour, they could exchange the treasure points they had just obtained, but there was no time for cultivation after exchanging the inheritance,

The items listed on the tokens included many quick-recovery elixirs and fruits that restored divine bodies and origin sources, albeit at outrageously high prices. For instance, one Life-Restoring Fruit could instantly restore a Grand Yan Immortal‚Äôs divine body to its peak, costing 50 treasure points. With that amount, one could exchange for a peak-level treasure set.

Then there were the Nine Revolutions Concentration Pills, a major pill for repairing origin sources, even more expensive than the Life-Restoring Fruit. They required 300 treasure points, enough to exchange for several ordinary Innate Treasures.

No wonder back then, MO Long had lost half of his origin source; he had consumed half of the items that restored his entire body.

Jian Wushuang hadn‚Äôt used any of his treasure points, just to be prepared for emergencies.

He could handle the first nine waves of the Devouring Demon Lords, but for the following ten waves, he had no solution because only nine waves were displayed. Even if he speculated through evolution, if he wanted to pass through all the stages, the difficulty was not small.

When those Devouring Demon Lords appeared, many of them were already at the Dao Lord level. Who knew if there were Devouring Demon Lords at the half-step Emperor level at the end?

Among the Grand Yan Immortals on the city wall who could accompany him until the end, there were probably not many left.

The Grand Yan Immortals at the extreme-level could barely get through the first nine waves. In the later stages, there might be only a few half-step Dao Lords left.

This trial depended entirely on individual willpower. As long as they held on for the first three waves, they could choose to retire and go back to the city for cultivation.

Judging by the determination in their eyes, there were probably not many willing to retire early. They all thought of fighting to the death. If they couldn‚Äôt hold on, they would retreat.

People like MO Long were rare in the entire universe. After all, there weren‚Äôt many tier 4 Emperors, and he was also an only child.

Only two types of people managed to survive here: those without significant power or background, and those with powerful backgrounds.

These survivors were not lacking in minor opportunities; what they lacked were the extraordinary opportunities presented by fate.

Some of them hailed from influential Emperor clans, while others were disciples of prestigious sects.

Regardless of whether it was a clan or a sect, internal conflicts were always more brutal than external ones.

In external conflicts, everyone fought together; the taller ones led the way, and there was not much to think about.

But internally, it was different. Among peers who were all Grand Yan Immortals, it was awkward to be just an ordinary Yan Immortal.

Others were Princes, peak-level Grand Yan Immortals, while you were just a common Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

This sense of disparity was the most effective motivator for one‚Äôs competitive spirit.

In the previous first- stage trial, it wasn‚Äôt really fair. Some ordinary Perfected Nine Revolutions didn‚Äôt have the strength to compete; even if they went, it would be a futile endeavor.

Now it was different. Regardless of your strength, at least you could strive to be in the top three waves!

By obtaining treasure points, exchanging them for powerful treasures and items, one could rapidly enhance their strength and continue to compete.

Jian Wushuang, who grasped this point, had some understanding of these people,

Three days had passed in the blink of an eye. The Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls could hardly contain their impatience; their eyes were fixed on the empty expanse outside the city.

The Devouring Demon Lords had long retreated, leaving the area surrounding the city eerily silent.ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

‚ÄúIn the struggle for positions, I don‚Äôt have the qualifications to be the commander, but I should at least have a chance to be the leader!‚Äù

‚ÄúHmph, you want to be the leader? At the very least, you should possess the strength of a half-step Dao Lord! You, an extreme-level Grand Yan Immortal, dare to dream of being the leader.‚Äù

According to the information transmitted from the heavenly pillar, the top-ranked Grand Yan Immortal in the first three waves could be appointed as the commander, with positions assigned based on ranking.

This was the fairest approach.

Initially, when Dao Lord Si Tian spoke, they naively thought they could elect their positions themselves!

‚ÄúWhat does it matter if there are no positions? The danger in the first three waves is minimal; it‚Äôs our chance. As long as we gain enough treasure points, we can obtain powerful inheritances.‚Äù

Everyone clenched their fists, quietly awaiting the first onslaught from the Devouring Demon Lords.

Jian Wushuang hovered in the air, gazing at the barrier before him. Once the trial began, this barrier would disappear, and he could leave the city to battle the enemy.

Buzz!

A bell rang out, resonating throughout the entire Original Universe.

All Grand Yan Immortals on the Original Planets heard this refreshing bell sound, looking up at the sky one after another.

The bell rang three times, and Jian Wushuang felt his mental power reach its peak. It was truly miraculous.

Boom!

Before they could think too much, a thunderous roar echoed from the heavenly pillar in the city behind them.

If the previous bell could clear their minds, this current roar was like a heavy punch landing squarely on their chests.

‚ÄúThe second stage trial begins now!‚Äù

The puppet‚Äôs voice had just fallen, and the barrier outside the city began to disintegrate. The barrier within the city still stood; the first three waves hadn‚Äôt been completed, and no one could enter the city.

The moment the barrier vanished, the Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls, like ferocious hounds, instantly charged out.

Tens of thousands of top-level Grand Yan Immortals led the way, all knowing that this first wave only contained 100,000 Devouring Demon Lords at the Nine Revolutions level, practically a slaughter for them..
