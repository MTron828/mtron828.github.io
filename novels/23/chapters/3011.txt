Chapter 3012: Breakthrough, Immortal Saint!

——

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang was completely surrounded by a sea of divine power.

His divine power, bones, and even cells were undergoing an unprecedented transformation.

Every breath and second of this transformation was earth-shaking.

The Divine Master and the Immortal Saint were two completely different levels. It was the difference between heaven and earth.

The Divine Master was very ordinary in the entire Beginning Divine World.

However, the Immortal Saint could still be called an expert in the Beginning Divine World.

In a place like the endless territories, an Immortal Saint could occupy a realm and become a Realm Master at any time if he wanted to.

In the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow World, eight of them were just ordinary Immortal Saints. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Previously, Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master. The reason why he could challenge Immortal Saints was because of his unique physique, his secret skills, and his comprehension of rules and Dao.

To put it bluntly, he was too powerful.

For ordinary cultivators, it was almost impossible for a Divine Master to challenge the Immortal Saint.

Because the gap between them was too big.

Now, Jian Wushuang had broken through to the Immortal Saint level. What he was going through was a transformation of his soul and even his essence.

This transformation did not last long. It only lasted for a while.

Everything gradually calmed down.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes again. The moment he opened them, a flash of lightning instantly burst out.

“Immortal Saint, have I finally become an Immortal Saint?” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the power in his body that had increased by countless times. He was extremely excited.

The Immortal Saint could be considered an expert in the Primordial Divine Realm.

Above the Immortal Saint was the Master of Principles, who was already at the peak of the Beginning Divine World. His goal was to surpass the Master of Principles and reach or even surpass the strength of his Master Xuan Yi when he was alive, now, he was one step closer to that goal.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang suppressed the shock in his heart, but his expression became serious.

“I’ve reached the Immortal Saint Realm, and my divine power is so strong. I must have attracted many people’s attention. I’m afraid that the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom will come here immediately. I can’t stay here any longer. I’ll leave first.”

Jian Wushuang was very decisive. He immediately restrained all his aura and quietly flew out of the city.

Not long after Jian Wushuang left the city, the three True Saints who had been around the city had arrived.

After they arrived, they searched carefully for a while, but Jian Wushuang had already left and did not leave any message.

They had no choice but to report this news.

…

In this completely sealed area, there was a towering golden temple floating in the vast void.

This Golden Divine Palace was where the upper echelons of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom gathered. During the past thirty years, Lord Wu had been staying in this Divine Palace, controlling the dragon imprisoning compass.

“It’s been thirty years. The Magic Note Army has a total of 200,000 troops. There are also many Immortal Saints and some Great Divine Masters from the surrounding realms. So many people have searched this region for a full thirty years, but they still haven’t found that person!” Lord Wu’s voice was ice-cold, his expression was extremely ugly.

“Lord Wu, in these 30 years, our people have almost searched the entire 1,000-kilometer area deep underground, but they still haven’t found that person. Could it be that that person isn’t hiding underground at all, but is hiding in those cities?” The True Saint beside him said.

“Cities? Haven’t we searched those cities several times, but we haven’t found a single thing?” Lord Wu said.

“Milord, although our people carried divine power testing stones with them when they searched, under normal circumstances, we would only allow some cultivators above the deity realm to participate in the testing. However, that person’s methods of hiding his aura are so amazing. If he deliberately hid his aura, for example, by disguising himself as an ordinary Divine Master or Earth Divine Master, or even by disguising himself as a strong realm expert and hiding within the cities, then our search would naturally not be able to find him.” That True Saint said.

“Hiding his aura and disguising himself as an ordinary Divine Master or a…?” Lord Wu was stunned, but he immediately shook his head, “Impossible. No matter how one conceals one’s aura, there will always be a limit. If a powerful Immortal Saint was in front of a group of Divine Masters, he could indeed disguise himself very well. He could even disguise himself as an ordinary person without revealing any flaws. However, the experts that we have sent to search the various cities are all True Saints!”

“Those True Saints of my Magic Note Divine Kingdom are not fools. His soul power is also extremely powerful. No matter how impressive that person’s means of concealing his aura are, being able to disguise as a Great Divine Master is already his limit. If he wants to disguise himself as an ordinary Divine Master or a Divine Devil realm expert in front of a group of True Saints, he will definitely not be able to do so!”

Lord Wu’s words were very decisive.

Indeed, under normal circumstances, unless the other party’s strength was much higher than his own, no matter how formidable his concealment techniques were, they would more or less reveal some flaws.

It was practically impossible for a cultivator to perfectly conceal his aura under the same cultivation level and disguise himself as a weak Divine Master or ordinary person.

“Then could we have been wrong from the start? For example, that person didn’t conceal his aura at all, and he himself is only a Divine Master?” That True Saint suddenly said.

Hearing this, Lord Wu swept a glance at this True Saint, as if he was looking at a fool.

This True Saint seemed to have realized that he was being a little crazy, and he could not help but smile awkwardly.

“Hmph, Divine Master?” Lord Wu snorted coldly and said, “To be able to kill Sky Mound King and Stone Saint in one move, his battle strength can even match a third level True Saint. Would he be a Divine Master? You really dare to think about it!”

“There are many talented experts in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, but as far as I know, even the supreme three palaces of Heaven-cleaving Alliance, even the most terrifying of the three palaces, the Primal Chaos Palace that abounds in monsters, absolutely no one can kill a second level True Saint with just the Divine Master realm!”

“Not to mention the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, even in the entire Beginning Divine Realm, no one can do it!”

Lord Wu made a solemn vow, and he firmly believed this in his heart.

But at this moment, he suddenly received a message.

“Lord Wu, someone in Blood Dipper city has just broken through from a Divine Master to an Immortal Saint, and it’s just a breakthrough, but the commotion is shocking. Especially that divine might, it’s much stronger than the divine might of many rank three True Saints!”
