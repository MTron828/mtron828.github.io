Chapter 1183: Swift Return!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang had already opened his eyes.

“Is this the power of the Stars?” Jian Wushuang asked. He could feel an extremely unique power coursing through his body.

It was from the first scroll of the Secret Skill of the Stars, and it took him 10 years to accumulate that amount of power.

“It took me 10 years just to accumulate this little bit of power from the Stars. Furthermore, I’ll only be able to use it for a duration equivalent to a couple dozen seconds. Does it mean to say that after I use it, I’ll have to wait 10 more years to be able to use the same ability again? And this is just the power from the first scroll to boot,”?thought Jian Wushuang, secretly amazed.

He would only be able to use the power gleaned from practicing the first scroll once every 10 years.

As for power from the second scroll, he would need even more to cultivate and accumulate it, and the interval between each use would also be lengthier. Jian Wushuang guessed that it would take centuries or even millennia before he could utilize power from the second scroll for a second time.

Just as he got up, he sensed something. A burly figure appeared directly in front of him.

“Master,” the figure said respectfully.

The burly figure was carrying a giant ax. Jian Wushuang realized that it was the same figure that he had fought against during his final test.

After Jian Wushuang assumed command over the Stellar Fog Sea, all of its resources were left to his control, including all of its treasures.

Even though there were many treasures within the Stellar Fog Sea, they were actually just little trinkets left behind by the creator of the Star Bloodline and Jian Wushuang was not exactly in awe of them. After all, he had seen those in the Fire Points Exchange Office of the Green Fire Palace before.

Jian Wushuang did not think too highly of the treasures within the Stellar Fog Sea, as even though there were some of them that were more precious, none of them could be of any practical aid to him.

The only one which made him feel pleasantly surprised to own was the burly figure in front of him.

The burly man was actually a Puppet Fighter, and he was the strongest of his kind in the Stellar Fog Sea. His strength was on par with a peak level Universe Master.

“Did you ever have a name?” questioned Jian Wushuang.

“I’m known as Fu Yi,” the burly man replied.

“Fu Yi?” replied Jian Wushuang as he nodded slightly. “From now on, you’ll follow me around.”

“Yes,” said the burly man with the utmost respect.

“Lord Spirit Sound,” shouted Jian Wushuang again.

The Gu King and she immediately appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Since I’ve cultivated the Secret Skill of the Stars, I might as well go to see them in Star Island, they must be eager to see me.” said Jian Wushuang with a laugh.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang and Lord Spirit Sound appeared on the tallest pavilion in Star Island.

“Gather around, everyone,” said Jian Wushuang casually. His voice, however, spread to all corners of the island.

All of the warriors on the island heard him and came running toward the pavilion.

In a short span, many people had gathered at the foot of the pavilion.

Several of Jian Wushuang’s buddies, including Dao Masters Kong Ming and Thousand Water, were also amongst the crowd and they looked at him and gazed at him with uncontrollable passion.

As early as ten years ago, they had already learned of the news that Jian Wushuang had passed the final test.

They had waited 10 years for him while he practiced the Secret Skill of the Stars.

These people were not concerned about the long wait. As long as Jian Wushuang was willing to let them go free, it was enough for them.

“Everyone!”

“Now that the Stellar Fog Sea is under my control, I hereby declare that all resources on Star Island will be open for public use from this point onward. Those of you who wish to stay behind are more than welcome to continue your meditation. As for those that wish to leave…”

With a wave of his hand, a space wormhole appeared in the Void beside Jian Wushuang.

“This space wormhole will lead you outside of the Stellar Fog Sea. You can use it to leave this place,” said Jian Wushuang with a laugh.

Hearing these words, the crowd below immediately became excited and all of them were exultant.

They have been trapped on Star Island for a long time and were treated like prisoners.

Many of them had already become twisted and deranged from being held captive for such a long time. They had also lost all hope of escape.

Now, finally, they could leave this accursed place.

Ecstasy!

Each of them felt an unprecedented ecstasy.

They were also grateful to Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Blood Mountain!”

“Blood Mountain!”

The crowd below looked fervently at Jian Wushuang. They felt that he had done them a huge favor by releasing them from captivity after completing his final test.

Seeing the scene below, Jian Wushuang only gave off a faint smile.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang!”

A message was sent directly to him, and it came from the Samsara Temple Master, one of the Five Great Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace.

The content of the message was very direct; it contained only two words.

“Return quickly!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jian Wushuang’s expression immediately turned serious after he received the message.

“The Five Palace Masters allowed me to roam freely on my own, as long as I did not easily reveal my identity. They promised that they would not ask me to return to the Palace before I had the capability to become its leader unless something big happened. Now…”

“Something must have happened!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly, his gaze extremely chilly.

Immediately, Jian Wushuang had an urge to leave the Star Island.

“Lord Spirit Sound,” Jian Wushuang said, “I have something urgent to attend to and must leave immediately.”

“Oh?” she asked, her expression changing.

“I’ve already shut down all Restrictions from the Stellar Fog Sea. From now on, Star Island will no longer remain in isolation from the outside world. Anyone with the requisite strength can come here to seek for opportunities,” Jian Wushuang explained. “As for you, Lord Spirit Sound, you can remain behind if you want to. If you do, control over the island will still be retained by you. If not, you can always feel free to leave.”

“I’ve gotten sick of Star Island after staying here for so many years. Now that I have a rare opportunity to leave, I’m definitely not going to remain behind. Why don’t we do it this way—my original body will leave the Stellar God Sea to enjoy in other worlds, while my doppelganger will remain on Star Island and help you take care of it,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Then I shall trouble you to do exactly that,” replied Jian Wushuang gratefully.

Immediately, Jian Wushuang left the Stellar Fog Sea with the Gu King and Fu Yi.

“The Green Fire Palace,”?he thought.

He had left the Palace quietly to avoid anyone noticing, and now he was returning in the same manner.

Within the towering halls, several Green Fire Palace Masters, including Jian Wushuang, had gathered together.

There was also a white-haired elder who was present.

“Holy Master Cloud?” asked Jian Wushuang in surprise as he looked at the elder.

Jian Wushuang recognized the old man; he was a very ancient Holy Master and he had come from a time long before anyone currently in the Green Fire Palace.

Even the Samsara and Void Temple Masters were younger than him.
