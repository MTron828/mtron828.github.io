"How come? Are you out of tricks!" The formidable figure shrouded in black mist finally uttered a complete sentence.

In the Beiwang Tower, there was only one opponent, but the strength of that opponent varied with each level.

Jian Wushuang, having mastered the Life power, underwent a profound transformation in his demeanor.

When wielding the power of thought, his mental strength was abundant, and anyone who cast a glance at him would sense that Jian Wushuang was a formidable warrior with a keen consciousness.

The power of Devouring, on the other hand, carried a hint of malevolence. Yet, upon second thought, considering that humans consume various forms of life, can it truly be deemed malevolent?

That malevolent aura seemed like an inherent fear, causing unease in anyone who beheld it.

The power of All Things was distinct from the preceding two.

The power of All Things altered Jian Wushuang's perspective on Myriad Daos, resembling his unique Dao.

Regardless of the nature of the power, it would ultimately be assimilated into the pinnacle of swordsmanship‚Äîthe Sword Dao.

The devouring power within the Illusory Phantom Sword, the potent Thought power of the Transcendent Immortal Formation, or the Heaven's Punishment of All Things, converged to form the Heaven's Punishment Sword Strike.

Now equipped with a newfound power, the Life power, his demeanor became gentle. Everything and everyone encountering him could sense a heartwarming aura.

It was a natural aura.

A pure and innocent aura.

It naturally elicited favorable feelings towards him.

He represented life.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang opened his arms, radiating a soothing influence over everything.

The formidable figure condensed in black mist stared at Jian Wushuang as if he were an idiot.

However, soon after, the fish in the water began to undergo a metamorphosis. Those inch-long fish gradually grew larger, developing various peculiar and grotesque wings.

These beings transcended everything, flying over the land before finally reaching a point where flight became possible.

"You actually intervened in the rules of this place!" exclaimed the formidable figure shrouded in black mist.

His eyes widened in disbelief. This place possessed a complete Universe Origin Source, how could it be manipulated by a Dao Lord?

Jian Wushuang completely relaxed. The fish that soared through the sky circled around him, treating him as a godfather.

"The Origin Source of this place should be a complete Origin Source of All Things!" Jian Wushuang speculated.

To be able to evolve this planet, the Universe Origin¬†Source here was undoubtedly extraordinary.

Only the Origin Source of All Things could achieve this.

He had never imagined that someone could actually produce a complete Origin Source of All Things.

The three Divine Masters were indeed extraordinary.

The formidable figure shrouded in black mist did not answer Jian Wushuang's question but instead interrogated, "How did you do it?"

"Because I am a god, the one true god!"

Jian Wushuang's aura surged, the power of Life emanating, encompassing millions of miles around. All life in this area began to degenerate.

The fish wings lost their wings and fell into the water, their bodies then decomposing and weakening, transforming into All Things.

The formidable figure in black mist also underwent degeneration. Its degeneration was somewhat slower; first, the mist became thin, and then only a red robe fell to the ground.

"Gone?" Jian Wushuang exclaimed in surprise!

This was the first time he had used such power.

Unexpectedly, he made the opponent disappear directly.

Then, he reversed life, accelerating the vitality of this place once again, and the formidable figure in black mist revived.

This time, without waiting for the opponent to speak, Jian Wushuang unleashed a Sword Qi, directly slaying the figure.

The power of Life had now fused, different from his initial speculations.

Initially, he thought that during the fusion, there needed to be a harmonious unity among the three, mutually restraining each other.

But the result turned out to be different.

On this planet, he witnessed the ultimate transformation of the power of All Things before deciding to make a desperate attempt.

"Turns out, I was overthinking it!" Jian Wushuang scratched his head.

He had indeed overthought things.

Whether he had overestimated the Extreme Dao or underestimated it, he couldn't say for sure.

However, he had successfully brought the Extreme Dao to perfection, with the path reaching its end. All that remained was the perfection of the Sword Dao, followed by the integration of the Daos.

Everything was getting better.

He no longer needed to delve into the realm of black holes or pursue the elusive perfection of Heart power.

Everything was progressing positively.

He found all of this to be somewhat straightforward.

This was all thanks to this place!

Otherwise, if he continued on his previous path, suppressing the transformation of the power of All Things, he might never have been able to break through in his entire lifetime.

Jian Wushuang's hands trembled with excitement.

Since mastering the Extreme Dao, he had faced numerous hardships along the way.

During the period of Thought Power, he was either running in the Great Desolate Wilderness or preparing to escape.

There was no peace for him, and he miraculously survived, eventually entering the Qishen Temple.

During the period of Devouring power, he was troubled by an evil aura. Even in the subsequent power of All Things, he never ceased his killings.

It was as if he had become a different person, sacrificing lives for the greater cause, killing countless individuals.

Now, everything was getting better.

He had finally rid himself of that particular kind of murderous intent, which was different from the Sword Dao's ferocity.

The Dao of the Sword is belligerent; to Devour is to destroy.

There remained a disparity.

Surroundings shifted once again as he broke through another layer. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

The planetary environment changed accordingly. Jian Wushuang continued to refine the Life power, paying no attention to the formidable black mist figure.

Persistently tormenting the adversary with the Life power, his body rapidly dissipated, only to swiftly recover afterward.

The convergence of life and death pushed the black mist figure to the brink of collapse.

Though not a manifestation of Life, it was nevertheless connected to All Things in the world.

Even a piece of wood could be manipulated by Jian Wushuang using the Life power, transforming it into a towering giant tree. Simultaneously, a trace of weakened origin could be rekindled with radiance.

In essence, Jian Wushuang discovered that the Life power corresponded not only to life itself but to all things and paths of existence. He could intervene in all of them.

This ability bestowed upon him numerous advantages.

Moreover, he found that accelerating life equated to accelerating time, indicating a profound connection to the origin of time.

He even pondered whether, after the successful fusion of Extreme Dao and the Origin Source, he could directly transcend space and grasp the source of time.

There was indeed such a possibility.

If that were the case, an Emperor mastering the Origin Source of Time would truly be extraordinary.

Defying fate!

"You, a mere Envoy of All Things, dare to treat me like this? I am personally refined by the esteemed Temple Master Xuan Yi, personally refined as the Envoy of All Things. Just you wait until the later floors; I will thoroughly ravage you!" The black mist figure repeatedly died and resurrected, continuously cursing Jian Wushuang.

If Jian Wushuang had killed him with a single sword strike, it would have been acceptable. However, by persistently delaying and tormenting him, he grew infuriated, swearing to retaliate when Jian Wushuang reached the later floors.

Yet, Jian Wushuang paid no attention to the adversary. However, upon hearing Xuan Yi, a hint of surprise flashed across his face.

But he didn't inquire further.

If the Master of Black Tortoise Temple was truly Xuan Yi, he would have come looking for him long ago.

Moreover, in the Three Kings Court, Xuan Yi had mentioned that they would meet in the future, not now.

Still, the coincidence of names intrigued him a bit.
