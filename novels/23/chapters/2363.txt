Chapter 2364: Outer Disciple

Wu Jian was an elder from the Water Fairy Island. Jian Wushuang entered the Water Fairy without any hindrance under Wu Jian’s personal guidance.

“You two can proceed to do whatever you need to.” Wu Jian said.

“Yes.” The two Chaotic Divine Demons behind Wu Jian answered and left.

“Little friend Wushuang, I will bring you around this place.” Wu Jian said gently.

“Thank you, Elder Wu Jian.” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

They then start touring Water Fairy Island.

Wu Jian introduced Jian Wushuang to the environment and structure of the Water Fairy Island.

“Elder Wu Jian!”

“Elder Nine!”

They ran into many disciples, Deacon Elders or Deacons. All of them greeted Wu Jian when they saw him.

In the Water Fairy Island, the most powerful man was the Island Master who was above the realm of Divine Demons.

Then there was the Elder Group.

There were eighteen elders within the Elder Group. Each of these eighteen elders was top tier tier one Chaotic Divine Demons. There were all peak Chaotic Divine Demons!

The next group of people was Deacon Elders. Most of them were tier two Chaotic Divine Demons. The two chief Deacon Elders were tier one Chaotic Divine Demons.

The next group was Deacons, who were mostly tier Three Chaotic Divine Demons.

Lastly, it was the disciples. There were some disciples in the Divine Demon realm, but most of them were in the Chaotic Realm.

Wu Jian was the ninth elder in the Elder Group. He was extremely powerful and influential within the Water Fairy Island.

This was why the people that they passed by looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“Who is that young man? A new disciple?”

“I have heard that there was a new genius that emerged in a prefecture. This got the attention of Elder Wu Jian and he traveled down personally to bring him back here. He should be that genius.”

“He must be really talented as he caught the attention of Elder Wu Jian. Elder Wu Jian treats him so nicely and even traveled down personally to bring him here.”

“He should be ranked top five in terms of talent even among the core disciples.”

Many people were chatting quietly.

These people felt that a disciple that Elder Wu Jian would go recruit personally would definitely be talented.

Jian Wushuang should be a core disciple and might be one of the most outstanding core disciples in the future.

It was a pity their guesses were destined to be wrong.

“Little friend Wushuang, this is the dojo. Many Deacon Elders or even Elders from the Elder Group will come here to teach lessons.”

“That is the arena. This is where our disciples have formal spars.”

“That is...”

Wu Jian introduced all of the places on the Water Fairy Island to Jian Wushuang.

Soon, Wu Jian brought Jian Wushuang to the nucleus of the Water Fairy Island: a small island.

This island was spacious, with a few majestic halls and one tall, black tower.

“Little friend Wushuang, that is the Water Fairy Tower. This is where the foundation of our clan lies. All of the secret skills and martial art skills are stored within the Water Fairy Tower. The reason why our clan is called Water Fairy Island is because of the Water Fairy Island.”

Wu Jian pointed at the tall Water Fairy Tower and said, “There are a total of six levels inside the Water Fairy Tower. The higher you go, the more powerful the secret skills are. However, there are criteria to enter each of the floors. All disciples from the Water Fairy Island have access to the first three floors. They can go in and find a secret skill that is suitable for them and leave with a copy of it.”

“Those who want to go to the fourth floor or higher must be minimally a core disciple.”

“Core disciples can enter the fourth and fifth floor at will. However, as for the sixth floor, even a core disciple cannot enter at will. This is where the most powerful and valuable secret skills of the Water Fairy Island are stored. A core disciple must: be extremely talented, have contributed greatly to the Water Fairy Island, and have the permission from the elders from the Elder Group before he can enter the sixth floor once.”

“Even so, he can only obtain a single copy of a single secret skill or technique.”

“I am an outer disciple of the Water Fairy Island. This means that I can only enter the first three floors of the Water Fairy Tower?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That should be the case, but...” Wu Jian smiled as he whipped out a token. He then said, “Here, take this.”

“This is?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“This is an Elder Token. Every elder in the Elder Group has one of such tokens. With this token, you are granted more power and privilege within the Water Fairy Island. Even though you are an outer disciple, you can still enter the fourth and fifth floor of the Water Fairy Tower with this token.” Wu Jian said.

“Thank you, Elder Wu Jian!” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

It was of utmost importance that Jian Wushuang recovered the fighting power he had when he was in his prime.

During this process, he could study different types of secret skills to improve his understanding of the various doctrines. The Water Fairy Island is ranked top ten among all of the clans within the Wusha Barren Region. It should have many valuable secret skills and techniques worth studying.

“You’re welcome. Let’s go. I will bring you to the Outer Garden.”

Wu Jian led Jian Wushuang towards a certain place on the Water Fairy Island.

The Outer Garden was where the outer disciples from the Water Fairy Island lived.

An outer disciple had much low standing within the Water Fairy Island as compared to the core disciples. However, there were many more outer disciples as compared to core disciples within the clan.

Even though the Outer Garden was located at a corner within the Water Fairy Island, it took up a great area.

Many outer disciples watched Wu Jian bring Jian Wushuang to the Outer Garden.

“Yu Yang!”

Wu Jian placed his hands behind his back and said as he landed within one of the courtyards.

Soon, an extremely old elder with a hunchback walked out from within the courtyard.

“Elder Nine, what brings you here?” The elder with a hunchback stood in front of Wu Jian and asked respectfully.

“Little friend Wushuang, this is Yang Yu. He is one of the Deacon Elders in the Water Fairy Island. He settles the chores within the Outer Garden.” Wu Jian said.

“Elder Yu Yang.” Jian Wushuang greeted modestly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Little friend Wushuang?” Elder Yu Yang, who had a hunchback, raised his eyebrows when he heard how Wu Jian called Jian Wushuang.

“Yu Yang. This is my little friend Jian Wushuang. From today on, he is an outer disciple of the Water Fairy Island. He will be part of the Outer Garden.” Wu Jian said.
