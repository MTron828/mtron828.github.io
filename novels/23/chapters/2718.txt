Chapter 2719: Enter the Secret Realm

Jian Wushuang and the others appeared in front of a gloomy mysterious old forest that was lingered with grey haze.

“This is...the City of Bones?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Danyang Continent was the core of Danyang Holy Domain and had an extremely large area. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

There were some extremely dangerous areas on such a huge piece of land.

The City of Bones was one of those extreme places on the Danyang Continent filled with dangers.

It was said there was a huge possibility for Grand Ultimate Gods to fall if they entered the inner area of the City of Bones.

There were even rumors that some horrendous dangers in the deepest area of the City of Bones could even kill an Undying Saint!!

In short, the City of Bones was famous for being vicious!

“The secret realm is in the City of Bones?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Let’s go.”‘ Devilish Wind King waved his hand before the group of six entered the City of Bones without any hesitation.

The City of Bones was extremely dangerous but they had six Grand Ultimate Gods working together to explore the place and would not face any great dangers as long as they did not enter the extremely dangerous inner area. The six of them skimmed through the entire journey and finally arrived at an insignificant canyon after a day.

“Alliance Master Su Han, do you see this canyon in front of us?” The Devilish Wind King stood beside Jian Wushuang.

“I indeed see it. Why? Is the secret realm inside this canyon?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Inside this canyon? No, the canyon you are seeing isn’t a real canyon, but just an illusion,” said the Devilish Wing King with a smile.

“An illusion?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and stared at that canyon again but could not determine if there was anything wrong with it.

Devilish Wind King said with a smile, “This illusion is extremely powerful and was personally created by the secret realm’s owner. Not only you, but even a real Undying Saint could not notice any flaws when they fly over this canyon. Even if somebody accidentally arrived at this canyon, they won’t be able to feel anything. Only people who own the token like us can activate the secret realm hidden in this canyon. Alright, let’s take our tokens out.”

The Devilish Wind King was the first to take his broken black sword out.

The others including Jian Wushuang also respectively took their broken black swords out.

Six broken black swords speedily combined before a unique aura radiated from the black sword.

Hum~~

The canyon in front of them slightly vibrated under that special aura as a spatial passage appeared amid the void.

The spatial passage was extremely dark and mysterious. It was impossible to see what was located at the other side of the passage with their bare naked eyes.

However, the Devilish Wind King and the others had an excited expression when they saw the spatial passage appearing before their eyes before entering the spatial passage.

Jian Wushuang followed behind them.

Waves of light flashed past them and they reappeared once again. Jian Wushuang discovered he had arrived at a huge dark void.

There was no end to the dark void without a glimpse of light.

“This...is the secret realm’s interior?” Jian Wushuang curiously looked around him.

There were all sorts of things found on heaven and earth in the dark void—it was not any different from a normal world.

However, that secret realm was formed by an expert with great means.

Only top experts could manage such means.

As for the remaining five people, they were not as curious since they were quite familiar with the situation around them as they had visited that place 50 years ago.

“This visit will be the same as our previous trip with the six of us working together to explore this area. Everybody should be careful as this secret realm contains all sorts of dangers. We’ll be eternally doomed if we accidentally fail and can only blame ourselves for our weakness with it having nothing to do with the others,” said the Saber Master in a low voice.

“That’s for sure.” The others who traveled together nodded in agreement.

“Come, let’s walk towards the deeper areas,” said the Saber Master before six of them immediately started skimming forward.

Even though they had previously experienced exploring the area, Saber Master and the others still traveled at a slow and cautious pace.

It was a secret realm created by top experts after all and was bound to be extremely dangerous, hence nobody dared to act carelessly.

Although this dark void was extremely huge, there was only one path that headed towards the deeper parts which only meant they had to keep skimming forward.

The group of six skimmed forward for around an hour but encountered nothing during their journey.

At that moment...

Saber Master who was leading in front suddenly exclaimed, “Stop.”

The six of them immediately stopped and looked towards the void in front of them.

That void’s area was different from the dark voids they previously passed by as there was a huge amount of hazy air current covering the entire void.

“We’ve arrived at the first dangerous spot. All of you have to be careful and don’t get lost as nobody will be able to rescue you,” reminded Saber Master.

Hong Chen and Long Xianzi seemed to be at ease. However, Yi Shen and Devilish Wind King looked a bit more solemn.

“Alliance Master Su Han, are your soul and state of mind considered strong?” The Devilish Wind King looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Soul and state of mind?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression slightly changed.

The Devilish Wind King continued, “We need to cross through the first dangerous spot in this secret realm. We’ve ventured through this area previously. Although we succeeded in doing so, this area is capable of leading one’s soul into chaos. There are even illusions in this area that can affect a person’s soul and state of mind, causing those with a weak soul or state of mind to get lost. They might even become mad so you need to be extremely careful later.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly as he was quite confident about his soul and state of mind.

The six of them immediately made their move.

Six figures skimming into the void that was filled with hazy air current void in front of them. A strong wave of unique energy immediately came rushing towards them as they entered.

The power wave was directed to a person’s soul. However, Jian Wushuang had a layer of indestructible Exquisite Pagoda around his soul which had astonishing defensive capabilities toward soul attacks. The chaotic effects toward the soul in this void had no effects on him.

As for the illusions in the void, Jian Wushuang had completely ignored them!

In terms of the state of mind...his state of mind had always been lofty.

His state of mind was as though made of steel as it was trained after experiencing many tribulations and tortures.

Although the void’s illusion felt extremely authentic, it was almost impossible for it to affect him.

Jian Wushuang skimmed through the void and did not stop at all during the entire way. He only traveled forward and had directly crossed the area filled with hazy air current in a short moment.
