Chapter 1181: Disciple of the Star Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Gu King was sitting with Lord Spirit Sound somewhere in Star Island, a Mirror Image before them. Naturally, it was that of Jian Wushuang’s final test.

At the start, both Gu King and Lord Spirit Sound could still remain calm even as they exclaimed in admiration when they saw Jian Wushuang displaying many different types of swordsmanships as he subdued the burly man.

Suddenly, however, they saw Jian Wushuang strike with his sword again.

It was the Dawn Light.

Gu King and Lord Spirit Sound were stunned as they witnessed the move.

“That, that sword move…” Lord Spirit Sound said, looking extremely shocked.

“That kid…” Gu King said, his eyes brimming with radiance.

“If I didn’t notice wrongly, the sword move he just made should be a unique skill!” exclaimed Lord Spirit Sound in a low tone.

“It’s definitely a unique skill. Even though its power can only be considered as ordinary, it can already be classified as a unique piece of skill,” said Gu King as he nodded solemnly.

“How could a Dao Master possibly come up with a unique skill?” asked Lord Spirit Sound, as she wondered how incredible it was.

She was aware of how difficult it was to create a unique skill.

It took millennia before a unique skill would be created by a Celestial or even a Universe Master, much less a Dao Master.

“How long had Jian Wushuang been cultivating his skills only thus far?

“There are countless Universe Masters in the Eternal Chaotic World, and if any of them came up with a unique skill and is moderately capable, he or she could already be considered as peerless. Such Invincible Universe Masters are extremely rare, even in the vast Eternal Chaotic World.

“This kid, however, has come up with a unique skill of his own,”Gu King secretly thought in admiration.

“In the past, I felt that his gift in Sword Principle was not on the same level as his father, even though he possessed great potential. After all, his father had the Sword Spirit Body and was born to pursue the Sword Principle. Now it seems that his gift in Sword Principle is the same as his father, if not greater!

“His father spent exactly 100,000 years cultivating his skills in the Space-time Secret Land, and even so, he only managed to create the Dream-chasing Sword Principle by modifying parts of another piece of unique skill. That move was only borderline unique skill level and could not be considered as such. It’s not on the same level as the Dawn Light that Jian Wushuang has created now!

“He’s a true genius in the Sword Principle. I’ve thought too little of him in the past,”?Gu King thought.

He was also shell-shocked.

“Gu King, to think you even congratulated me previously. It now seems that you should be the one who should be congratulated instead. It seems that you’ve found a good master; the potential of Blood Mountain is limitless, and as long as he doesn’t die prematurely, there’s a chance that he could achieve the skill levels of your previous owner, King Luo Zhen. At that time, you will also have a chance of restoring your strength to your peak level,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

Gu King could not hold in his smile; he felt absolutely blissful.

“Let’s go. We should welcome him back,” Lord Spirit Sound added.

Jian Wushuang, who was still within the black tower, was already slowly sheathing the Blood Mountain Sword.

The burly man who had been challenging him bowed respectfully and then went off to the side to wait quietly on his own.

Shortly after, a wormhole began appearing within the surrounding black Void.

“Come, Blood Mountain,” Lord Spirit Sound’s voice traveled into the tower.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and stepped into the wormhole immediately.

He saw Lord Spirit Sound and Gu King in his form of a skinny elder in the dimly lit great hall.

“Gu King? You can transform into human form?” asked Jian Wushuang as he looked at the elder in surprise. It was the first time he had seen Gu King in such a form.

“Humph. All Exotic Beasts can transform into human form as long as they are capable enough; it’s only that most of them are unwilling to. As a Plenilune, of course I can do that as well. I just couldn’t be bothered to,” grunted Gu King coldly.

Jian Wushuang laughed controllably.

“Congratulations, Blood Mountain. From now on, you’re a disciple of the Star Palace,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Lord Spirit Sound, my real name is Jian Wushuang. Blood Mountain is just my alias,” said Jian Wushuang with a laugh.

“Alias? That’s unimportant. Anyway, it’s a fact that you’ve passed the final test of Star Island. According to rules set up by the creator of the Star Bloodline, I have to give you three things.” Lord Spirit Sound said.

She then drew out three items.

They were a gray light bead, a token, and a Secret Skill respectively.

Firstly, Lord Spirit Sound passed the bead to Jian Wushuang, saying, “This gray light bead is the core of the Stellar Fog Sea. All sorts of technique, such as Restrictions, within the Stellar Fog Sea, is controlled by it.?All you have to do is to allow it to recognize you as its owner. You’ll then be able to control the entire Stellar Fog Sea.”

“Oh?” exclaimed Jian Wushuang as his eyebrows arched in wonder.

Some time back, he had heard Lord Spirit Sound mention that anyone who passed the final test could gain control over the Stellar Fog Sea, and now, the lives of those people who were trapped on the island were in his hands.

Jian Wushuang immediately began cultivating his control over the sea. It went extremely smoothly, and it took only a while for him to master it.

He also came to understand everything about the Stellar Fog Sea, including some of its secrets, for example, what sort of Restrictions it could impose, what unique spots there were, and even what sort of treasures were in it.

“How can the Stellar Fog Sea benefit me?” Jian Wushuang asked as he frowned slightly.

“Our founder used it to pick his disciples, and it doesn’t serve many purposes aside from that. By giving you control over the Stellar Fog Sea, the founder wants to make it easier for you to get some of the treasures in the sea. Things such as the Star Jade Wall and the 12 Secret Skills can only be handled after you have control over it,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“From now onwards, how you handle the Stellar Fog Sea is entirely up to you. You can bring it along with you, and use it to imprison anyone that is not to your liking during your travels in the Eternal Chaotic World. If you don’t want to do that, you can also leave it in this world.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I have the Blood Mountain Sword, and it already grants me the ability to suppress. As such, I don’t need the Stellar Fog Sea. Let it remain here; the Star Island shall continue to exist. I will also not shift the opportunities in it away. Leave them to future practitioners,” said Jian Wushuang with a slight smile.

“Aside, I will also remove all fog and Restrictions from the island, allowing everyone to have a chance to benefit from the opportunities within it.”

“You’re the owner of Star Island now and can do as you see fit,” said Lord Spirit Sound with a laugh. She then brought the token before Jian Wushuang.
