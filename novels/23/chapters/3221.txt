Chapter 3222: Inviting People

——

“This Su Yi is actually quite strong,” said Qian Hongzi.

“He is indeed very strong. Conservatively speaking, he should be able to rank in the top 30 of the True Saint List. Compared to Su Xie, who was ranked 24th, there shouldn’t be much of a difference. Unfortunately, he picked the wrong opponent,” said Yue Yu with a smile.

“That’s right. With his strength, if he were to challenge those ranked at the bottom of the True Saint List, there would really be a competition. Who would win or lose would still be unknown? Even if he were to challenge those ranked at the top, even if he couldn’t win, he would at least be able to hold on for a period of time. However, he is challenging Di Hao…” Duan Lang also smiled faintly.

Di Hao was ranked eighth on the True Saint List. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But this was a ranking from a long time ago.

After entering the Blood Wave Realm, the few of them had seen with their own eyes that Di Hao had directly suppressed Thunder God, who was ranked sixth. His strength could definitely be ranked in the top five of the True Saint List. And once he used the strongest ax made of the two great principles…Di Hao even had the combat strength of the top three of the True Saint List!

Su Yi had no chance of struggling against Di Hao.

He was defeated with only three strikes.

“There are too many experts in the central area. Before the competition for the Blood Wave Token begins, there will be many challenges. If you see a suitable opponent nearby, you can also fight.” Qian Hongzi smiled.

Jian Wushuang and the others looked at each other with smiles on their faces.

In the following time, they quietly waited in the open space. As time passed, more and more experts rushed to the central area, so the central area became more and more lively, all kinds of challenges and competitions were more frequent.

But after all, it was just a challenge. Most people knew their limits and did not really kill.

Time passed. In the blink of an eye, another five days had passed.

At this time, it was already the twelfth day since the Blood Wave Realm opened. There was still some time before the Blood Wave Token appeared. However, those top Immortal Saints who were qualified to enter the Blood Wave Realm…had almost all gathered in the central area.

In the vast blood-colored world.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures quickly streaked through the air and arrived in front of a bald blood-colored mountain.

“We’re here.”

The leader of the three was a graceful and extremely charming woman wearing a silver robe. This woman’s face was extremely beautiful and could be said to be peerless in the world. Her every action was enough to cause one to dream about her, this was definitely a peerless beauty that could make many people go crazy over her.

“Not long after, there was news that someone saw that person rush into this mountain with his own eyes. With his temper, as long as he came to this central area, he shouldn’t wander around. It would be best if he chose a quiet place to wait for the Blood Wave Token to appear,” the silver-robed woman said with a smile.

“Is that guy in this mountain?” The two people beside him looked at the mountain in front of them with extremely solemn expressions.

“To be honest, your mission this time is just to deal with a person who isn’t even qualified to enter the True Saint List. It’s more than enough with the three of us. Are you sure you really want to enter this mountain and invite that person out?” The silver-robed charming woman said strangely.

“The two of us also think it’s more than enough, but this is an order personally given by the top existences behind us. We don’t dare to disobey,” a golden-haired muscular man said coldly.

“That’s right. Perhaps the person we are going to kill has some extremely special reason. That is why the top existences behind us pay so much attention to it. They are afraid that he might escape if they appear,” another man with the appearance of an elegant young master also spoke.

“Since that is the case, alright. The three of us will enter together.” The silver-robed enchanting woman spoke. After which, the three of them directly walked into the mountain.

The expression of the silver-robed lady changed the moment they approached the mountain.

“He is indeed here. I have already sensed him.” The silver-robed lady opened her mouth. However, she continued, “He is here.”

Swoosh!

A breeze blew over. Soon after, a human figure appeared in front of the three of them.

The person who had appeared was wearing a loose long robe. He carried a green-colored long rod on his back. His face was handsome. His two sword-like eyebrows made him appear mighty even though he was not angry.

“Nine Palace Saintess, Silver Wolf, and Gu Zhenzi, the three of you actually came to my place together? Do you want to have a big fight with me?” The long-robed man carrying Brother Beast’s long rod looked coldly at the three people in front of him.

Hearing the long-robed man’s words, the hearts of the three people who had come all went up.

The three of them were all extremely famous.

The silver-robed woman, the Nine Palace Saintess, was ranked third on the True Saint List. She was ranked in the top three, and she had even killed an Invincible Saint.

The man who looked like a young master was even the Silver Wolf who was ranked fifth on the True Saint List!

As for the golden-haired muscular man, Gu Zhenzi, he was ranked tenth on the True Saint List!

One was ranked third, one was ranked fifth, and one was ranked tenth. The three of them worked together, but they were still a little afraid of the long-robed man before them.

There was nothing they could do because the man in the long robe was…the Light King!

He was ranked first on the True Saint List, the most powerful person in this era, and the only Immortal Saint in this era who could combine the two principles.

Just thinking about how terrifying he was made people shudder.

Although the Nine Temples Saintess, ranked third, had also killed the Invincible Saint, she had spent a lot of effort to kill him. However, the Light King had killed the Invincible Saint…it was detailed on the True Saint List, the Light King had killed the Invincible Saint with only one stick!

Yes, with just one stick, the Invincible Saint’s divine body had been shattered, and he did not even have the chance to regenerate his divine body.

Because of this, even if the Nine Temples Saintess, Silver Wolf, and Gu Zhenzi joined hands, they did not have much confidence in fighting the Light King.

“Among the Immortal Saints of the Divine Beginning Realm, perhaps only the son of Saint Devil could fight this pervert in a head-on battle,” the Nine Temples Saintess thought.

She knew that she could not compete with the Light King.

However, although the son of Saint Devil, who ranked second on the True Saint List, did not fuse the two principles, the son of Saint Devil was a special life form with a huge innate advantage. With this advantage…perhaps he could have a face-to-face battle with the Light King.

“Light King, the three of us came here with no ill intentions. We’re here to ask for your help,” Silver Wolf said.

“Ask for my help?” The Light King’s lips curled up. “I’m all alone. I don’t have any dealings with you two saints.. You want my help? I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong person!”
