Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Chuu!

An incomparably terrifying sword light directly burst out.

Even the two purple-masked assassins could not help but shudder secretly when they sensed the frightening power embedded in the sword light.

Both of them were still retreating swiftly to escape the previous three sword moves from Jian Wushuang. The one who was targeted by the bursting sword light only had time to brandished his purple soft sword, trying to deflect the sword light.

Boom!

The terrifying sword light released an incredibly shocking power, knocking the purple soft sword away, and then using the undiminished remnant power of the sword light to strike the purple-masked assassin’s body.

In an instant, a big round bloody hole, with a diameter of more than one centimeter, appeared on the body of the purple-masked assassin.

The bloody hole pierced his body, shredding and smashing any organs and flesh it passed by.

The purple-masked assassin’s eyes widened while blood poured wildly from his mouth. Then his body fell down backwards.

The first purple-masked assassin was dead!

“What...?”

The other living purple-masked assassin was shocked by the scene. His heart suddenly thumped as Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes looked over towards him.

“Run!”

The imposing purple-masked assassin, a peak expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, did not hesitate to fly up into the sky. Not until he reached the void over ten meters above Jian Wushuang did he dare to stop and glance at him in terror.

“Terrifying! His sword skill is too Terrifying!”

“Fiery Wind Sword Essence. Yes, he has already combined the Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire into the Fiery Wind Sword Essence. His comprehension of the sword essence is much better than mine.”

“Two on one, old nine and I were still defeated by him, and old nine was even killed in one attack!”

“His strength is far beyond the common Initial Yin Void Realm. He might even be able to rival experts in the Profound Yin Void Realm!”

The purple-masked assassin murmured.

“Voidwalking?” Jian Wushuang frowned when the purple-masked assassin fled into the air.

Warriors in the Yin-Yang Void Realm were able to Voidwalk, so Jian Wushuang could not stop him if the former wanted to escape.

Though the purple-masked assassin was out of his reach, An Ying and the other gold-masked assassins, who were not able to Voidwalk, were still on the ground.

“He fought with two purple-masked assassins and even killed one of them! How...How could that be possible?”?An Ying felt it was unbelievable, as he looked at the dead body of that purple-masked assassin.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang looked over at him.

An Ying was frightened out of his senses.

“Quick, kill him, go and kill him!” An Ying roared.

The eight gold-masked assassins beside him froze for a moment, then immediately rushed out.

Assassins of Blood Feather Tower were all well-trained. Even if the order from their superiors was to get themselves killed, they would not hesitate to obey.

While the gold-masked assassins rushed forward, An Ying fled in another direction, yelling at the purple-masked assassin in the air, “Come! Come and save me!”

That purple-masked assassin began to approach once he heard him.

“You want to escape?”?Jian Wushuang shot a glance at An Ying and snorted.

All the other assassins in the Clearwater Stronghold didn’t have to die. He wouldn’t mind even if the two purple-masked assassins stayed alive. But he would not let An Ying escape, never.

“Get out of my way!”

Jian Wushuang cried out, followed by another flash of sword light. An utterly light and graceful sword move danced through the heavy rain and then swept across the throats of the eight gold-masked assassins.

The eight gold-masked assassins were all killed in an instant.

“Do you think you can escape?”

After killing the eight gold-masked assassins with just one move from the Formless Sword Art, Jian Wushuang dashed out immediately, and appeared behind An Ying in the blink of an eye.

“How could he be so fast?” An Ying turned pale with fright. Realizing that the purple-masked assassin couldn’t escape with him into the air before Jian Wushuang could catch him, his face became grim and madness arose in his eyes.

“Bastard! Go to hell!”

An Ying turned around with a rush, hurling a coldly glaring knife right toward the space between his eyebrows.

The knife was incredibly fast and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in a flash.

“Ridiculous.”

Jian Wushuang sneered as he slid past the knife with a ghost-like movement, then swung his sword across An Ying’s wrist. An Ying’s entire hand was chopped off.

“Ahhhhh!”

An Ying howled with great pain, while Jian Wushuang had already appeared in front of him. A brutal power was condensed in Jian Wushuang’s palm, which was then clenched into a fist and launched into An Ying’s abdomen.

“Puff!”

An Ying spewed a large mouthful of blood, and his complexion instantly became pale again, “My Gold Core, my Gold Core...”

Although An Ying was also an expert in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, he did not even have a chance of resisting when Jian Wushuang destroyed his Gold Core.

The Gold Core was the source of spiritual power for warriors. Since it was destroyed, the decades of earnest cultivation that An Ying endured instantly crumbled to dust.

“You’ll be dead soon. Why care about your Gold Core?”

Jian Wushuang laughed scornfully. He reached out with his hand and gripped An Ying’s neck, raising An Ying’s body up into the air as if gripping a chicken, and then slammed it down fiercely onto the ground.

BANG!

Even with the buffer of the gathered water from the rain, the blow cracked the ground below. An Ying once again madly squirted blood from the severe damage to his organs. Then, he passed out from the intense pain.

The next moment Jian Wushuang lifted An Ying’s body, looking up towards the purple-masked assassin in the air.

An unparalleled hint of fear emerged in the purple-masked assassin’s eyes, so he did not dare to come down and fight with Jian Wushuang, not even for An Ying.

“Purple-masked assassins? Just so-so.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ignoring the purple-masked assassin, Jian Wushuang grinned and quickly dragged An Ying out of the courtyard. Soon he disappeared from the purple-masked assassin’s sight.

The purple-masked assassin stood alone in the air, gazing at the sea of blood down on the ground. As the only survivor in the stronghold, he could not help being speechless.

This massacre brought a great loss to Blood Feather Tower.

More than a hundred copper-masked and silver-masked assassins in the entire Clearwater Stronghold were slain to the last man.

The twelve gold-masked assassins all died in the carnage, too.

Of course, these losses were nothing compared to the death of that purple-masked assassin and An Ying being caught.

“I had no idea that Jian Wushuang, who fell into the abyss two years ago, would still be alive and have improved his strength so much in such a short period!”The purple-masked assassin clasped his hands.

“Since he is alive, Blood Feather Tower will be in some real trouble!”
