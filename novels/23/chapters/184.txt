Chapter 185: The Rampant Bandit

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“There are four kinds of Kill Armlets, arranged according to the fugitive’s strength and the crimes they have committed. Black Iron, Silver, Purple Gold, and Blood Jade,” the Golden-armored General explained.

“Different armlets represent different points. For example, a Silver Armlet is worth several Black Iron Armlets.”

“As for how many points are needed, I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you that.”

“You can’t tell us?” Jian Wushuang and others were stunned.

“Yes,” the Golden-armored General said.

“The twelve dynasties do not want you to know the required amount. They wanted you to know nothing, that way you will try your best to get as many armlets as possible.”

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly with a serious expression.

“Besides that, there is one more thing you need to know.” The Golden-armored General continued, “The hunt is a personal fight, which means you have to act alone and are forbidden from joining together. Also... the armlets you get cannot be given to others.”

“From the very beginning of the Easternmost Hunt, the whole Easternmost Plain will be under strict surveillance by experts from the twelve dynasties. If anyone tries to give their armlets to someone else, both people will be eliminated.”

“That’s all. Am I understood? If you have any questions, ask me now.”

The Golden-armored General looked at them.

Jian Wushuang and other fourteen geniuses looked serious.

In the hunting phase, they had to act alone and their armlets couldn’t be given to others...

“Sir, will we come across other top geniuses of the twelve dynasties in these five days?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You shouldn’t.” The Golden-armored General shook his head and said, “The Easternmost Plain is vast and the warriors from the twelve dynasties set off from their own dynasties. It’s hard to come across them since they all came here from different directions.”

“Surely, we can’t exclude the possibility that some geniuses might purposely come looking for you.”

“And what about the Sky Valley Point Battle in stage two?” Mu Yingying asked.

“Sky Valley Point Battle... You will find out after you pass the first stage. It’s pointless to tell you now.” The Golden-armored General waved his hand, making it clear that he wasn’t going to explain.

All of them felt great pressure.

One hour passed quickly.

“Time is up.”

The Golden-armored General looked up into the air and then looked at Jian Wushuang and the others before saying, “the Easternmost Hunt starts now. Keep in mind, you are the top geniuses of Tianzong Dynasty. Put on a good show for yourselves as well as for Tianzong Dynasty.”

“Go!”

The fifteen griffins immediately flew out like fifteen streams of flowing light, rushing towards the endless plain.

“Second Brother, Fourth Sister, take care.”

“Guys, good luck.”

Jian Wushuang said.

“Good luck!”

Said the other geniuses, then they separated and started their own hunting trip.

...

In the vast plain, Jian Wushuang hopped off from the Griffin and landed on the ground. He raised his head and looked off into the distance.

“This is like the middle of nowhere in the Easternmost Plain. The bandits should all gather somewhere here.”?Jian Wushuang slightly smiled, “when will I meet you...”

Unlike the caravans, who prayed not to meet bandits when they passed through the Easternmost Plain, Jian Wushuang was hoping to meet them.

He walked alone in the plain with his long sword on his back.

At the same time, several figures gathered together and talked in a grassy area not far away.

“Wow, you know, the Second Leader’s wife is so beautiful, with her sparkling eyes and slim waist. I have been in the mountain stronghold for such a long time, but I have only seen her twice, and each time I could not help but drool.”

A fat, middle-aged, bare-armed?man, was chatting with several bandits.

Hearing what he said, the bandits around him could not help but swallow.

“And of course, beautiful as she is, she can not be compared to White Lady,” the fat middle-aged man said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“White Lady?”

“The greatest beauty recognized in the Easternmost Plain, White Lady?”

“I heard the White Lady was strong and that she was also the leader of a bandit gang.”

Other bandits sitting nearby were talking about the same thing.

“Right, that is her. I met her once and I fell in love with her at first sight. I swear I will not marry anyone but her,” the fat middle-aged man said.

“Really? You sure you are not exaggerating?”

“Is she such a beauty?”

“Haha, I also met her once. She really is a beauty, and I also want to marry her.”

“Go away! She is mine.” The fat middle-aged man was displeased.

At this time...

“Brother Tang,” a bandit rushed forward and told the fat middle-aged man, “Someone is coming.”

“Oh?” The fat middle-aged man changed his expression slightly, then immediately stood up and asked, “How many people? Is it a caravan?”

“No, it is only one person in the Profound Gold Core Realm,” The bandit answered.

“A single warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm?” The fat middle-aged man apparently lost interest, but he still said, “A small sparrow still has feathers that can be plucked. Hurry up, surround him and make sure he can’t escape.”

The bandits moved quickly and soon caught sight of Jian Wushuang walking alone in a casual manner.

“It’s really only one person.” The fat middle-aged man’s face showed an interesting smile, “a warrior in the Gold Core Realm dares to come to the Easternmost Plain alone. You truly are reckless and blind.”

“Guys, go, let’s teach him a lesson.”

The bandits who followed the middle-age man were excited.

“You, stop!” A shout was heard.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked toward him. When he saw the fat middle-aged man moving in his direction, he smiled to himself.

“The first group of bandits has come.”

“But they are too weak, and none of them are fugitives.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly, he had noticed that no one, among the almost ten bandits, wore an armlet.

Without armlets, it was pointless for Jian Wushuang to kill them.

“Maybe I could get an armlet for killing them, but I might gain some useful information if I let them talk.”

Thinking that, Jian Wushuang walked directly towards the fat middle-aged man and the others.
