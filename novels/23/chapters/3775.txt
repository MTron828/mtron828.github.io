Chapter 3776: Nine Levels of the Volcano

Jian Wushuang was no longer surprised to see the white-bearded white-robed elder take out tea.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang picked up a bowl of tea from the table and ate it.

Jian Wushuang frowned when he ate the tea.

Unlike the tea taken out by the black-robed man at the foot of the mountain, the black-robed man’s tea, although extremely bitter, had a great taste. It was warm and comfortable to drink, but the tea taken out by the white-bearded white-robed elder.., extremely unpleasant to drink.

“What? It’s very unpleasant to drink, isn’t it?” The white-bearded white-robed elder looked over. “I can’t help it. I’m not good at making tea, but the effect of this tea is the same. It will also bring you into a space of consciousness. You and I will fight in the space of consciousness.”

After saying that, the white-bearded white-robed elder also ate the bowl of tea in front of him.

Soon, the effect of the tea came into play. Jian Wushuang and the white-bearded white-robed Elder’s consciousness had entered a special space of consciousness.

This place was no longer the vast sea, but the center of a barren mountain range. There were bare mountains around and under their feet. The scorching sun baked the air, making it a little hot.

The white-bearded, white-robed elder stood in the void. Unlike the outside world, this white-bearded, white-robed elder seemed to have transformed into a different person after coming to this space of consciousness. His body was filled with a monstrous aura.

This aura was wild and violent. The heat was like a raging flame.

“Little fellow, take this.”

...

The white-bearded, white-robed elder did not say a single word. In this space of consciousness, he directly attacked.

He did not use any weapons. He was purely relying on his own palm. His palm was completely red, as if it had just been burned by a raging fire.

“Volcano, collapse!”

With a fierce shout, the white-bearded, white-robed elder fiercely slapped out with his palm.

In an instant, a large amount of red air waves rolled out. These red air waves gathered crazily, and in an instant, they actually gathered into a towering mountain that was 30,000 feet tall.

This mountain was surrounded by raging flames that burned everything in the world.

Boom!

The terrifying flaming mountain fell from the sky and pressed down on Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. A series of ear-piercing and shrill gusts of wind came. The wind was so strong that Jian Wushuang could hardly open his eyes. He could only raise his head and look at the endless mountain above him. The power of the mountain…it was earth-shaking.

“The power of an Advanced Ruler, and this move...is very powerful!”

Jian Wushuang had a rough idea of the strength of the white-bearded white-robed elder.

The black-robed man at the foot of the mountain was only an elementary Ruler, but his spear skills were superb and extremely powerful.

The power of the white-bearded white-robed elder was definitely at the Advanced Ruler level. The way he used the move, the towering mountains, and the terrifying air waves were enough to make one’s heart skip a beat, this technique was no less powerful than the black-robed man’s spear technique.

Sensing the power of the towering mountain, Jian Wushuang naturally did not hold back his strength.

The life divine power, Heaven-cleaving skill, and the power of the will given by the universe principles were unleashed at this moment. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Break!”

With a low roar, Jian Wushuang slashed out with the Netherworld Divine Sword in his hand.

Starfire Burning Sun!

Whoosh!

A fierce and direct sword light rushed out with an unprecedented violent and unstoppable momentum.

Using violence to counter violence!

The same extreme violence and the same majestic power.

In the blink of an eye, the fierce sword light collided with the towering mountain that fell from the sky.

Bang!

With a loud sound, the world rumbled.

The towering mountain that was hundreds of thousands of feet tall was actually directly cleaved apart by that ferocious sword light.

The sword cleaved apart the mountain, and it was even cleaving at the gigantic mountain of flames that was completely condensed by the white-bearded white-robed old man’s divine power!

Hualala! A large amount of power crazily charged out in all directions, and the entire world was in the midst of a large area of flames.

“Oh?”

When the white-bearded white-robed elder saw the majestic volcano being directly split open, his eyes lit up.

“To be able to directly split open the first layer of my volcano, you little fellow really have some ability. However, my volcano has a total of nine layers!”

“The nine layers of volcano secret art that I created. Although my strength is currently limited, and the power and profoundness that I can unleash is only one-thousandth, it isn’t something that an ordinary person can withstand.”

“Boy, let’s see how many layers of volcanoes you can block!”

As soon as he finished his words, the white-bearded white-robed Elder’s divine power surged crazily.

Red air billowed in the sky, and towering volcanoes that were even taller than before appeared one after another.

These volcanoes took shape, and each of them contained much more power and pressure than the previous one.

“Volcano, destroy!”

The white-bearded and white-robed elder roared.

The volcanoes that had already taken shape immediately rushed toward Jian Wushuang one after another.

The terrifying power suppressed everything in the world. At this moment, the Earth under Jian Wushuang’s feet, which was separated by the void, could no longer withstand the terrifying power of these volcanoes and exploded, the entire world was filled with an aura of destruction.

In the blink of an eye, the second volcano had arrived.

After the second volcano, there were the third and fourth volcanoes!

As for the fifth volcano, it was in the process of condensing.

“Nine volcanoes?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a trace of shock, but there was more excitement.

“Come on.”

Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. He released his divine power to the extreme. He knew that the volcanoes contained earth-shaking power, but he did not intend to retreat. Instead, he soared into the sky, he faced the volcanoes bravely.

Then, boom!

A terrifying sword light suddenly lit up.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of earth-shaking noises could be heard. The second volcano was directly smashed into pieces by the sword light.

Then the third and fourth volcanoes were formed.

Even the fifth and sixth volcanoes, which were more powerful, could not withstand the earth-shaking power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship and were destroyed one by one.

Bang!

Another loud sound was heard.

The seventh volcano was also split open by Jian Wushuang.

“What?”

The scene in front of him made the white-bearded, white-robed elder look surprised, but then he burst into laughter, “Haha, good boy. I have been guarding this Star Field for several chaos cycles. Three Principles Masters came to me. They were also hit by my nine-stage volcano secret skill, but the weakest one could not even survive the second volcano. Even the strongest one could only survive the fifth volcano and could not withstand the sixth volcano.”

“And you have survived the seventh volcano?”
