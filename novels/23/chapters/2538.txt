Chapter 2539: Dragon Phoenix Pavilion

The Shi clan was one of the top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Territory, hence naturally their residence was huge.

In a grand hall, the head of the Shi clan, Shi Qianhan was talking with two other people and the three were seemingly equal as none of them had acted haughtily.

Those two who could be with Shi Qianhan on equal footings were definitely not ordinary people. In fact, they were commanders of the army.

At that instance...

“Mmm?” Shi Qianhan’s expression changed with his brows knitted tightly as he received a message from the graceful woman.

“What’s the matter?” asked both commanders upon noticing the changes in Shi Qianhan’s complexion.

“Something happened at the Gladiatorial Arena. A Primary-Level Ultimate God who joined the Blood Gladiators Challenge had won four games in a row,” said Shi Qianhan.

“Blood Gladiators?” The two commanders were surprised.

One of the commanders wearing scarlet armor smiled and said, “It’s not easy to challenge the Blood Gladiators, especially the Ultimate Gods experts. He must be extremely powerful if this person can win four games in a row.”

“I haven’t seen a Blood Gladiator for a long time.” The other commander also smiled.

“I’m happy if there are new Blood Gladiators, but the current problem is Jian Yi’s very large bet. He bet five thousand Primordial Stones and upon success, the Shi clan will lose one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones at once. That’s not a small sum,” said Shi Qianhan.

“One hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones?” The two commanders were shocked.

The Shi clan was indeed unwilling to lose such a large amount of Primordial Stones.

“I hope both of you can help me this time since we have a great friendship,” said Shi Qianhan.

“Both of us are Peak Ultimate Gods. What can we do for you?” asked the scarlet-armored commander.

“There’s no need for both of you to take action in person. Are there any powerful Primary-Level Ultimate Gods in the army? It’s best if there’s someone who’s strong enough to face a High-Level Ultimate God,” explained Shi Qianhan.

“A powerful Primary-Level Ultimate God?” The two commanders exchanged looks between each other as they knew Shi Qianhan wanted to find a suitable expert from the army to face off Jian Yi.

It seemed impossible to get a Primary-Level Ultimate God from within the Shi clan to defeat Jian Yi, hence Shi Qianhan was hoping someone from the army could do it. The army had many geniuses and experts among them after all. Some of them were definitely great, powerful, and brave warriors.

This was not the only time the Shi clan received help from the army. There were many occasions when they had to win the Blood Gladiator Challenge’s final battle and their last resort was to get help from the army.

It was only possible for the Shi clan who had an excellent relationship with the powerful army leaders.

“It’s not difficult to find someone from the army. In fact, I have a candidate under my command who is a Primary-Level Ultimate God, yet is able to compete against High-Level Ultimate Gods and might even have a good chance of winning. He’s currently serving as an army captain which is a fitting position for a High-Level Ultimate God. However, it’s a pity I sent him on a mission not long ago. There’s no way that he could return in a short time,” said the scarlet-armored commander.

Shi Qianhan frowned.

It was no use even though he could defeat Jian Yi as he was going to be away for a while.

“I can recommend someone to you,” said the other white-robed commander.

“Who?” Shi Qianhan immediately looked over.

“Ancient Witch,” said the white-robed commander.

“Oh? It’s her!” The scarlet-armored commander was taken aback. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ancient Witch? Who’s she? Is she a Primary-Level Ultimate God in the army?” Shi Qianhan asked.

“No, she’s not from the army. Some members of our army accidentally provoked her not long ago. As a result, she taught those people a hard lesson. Those members later got their platoon consisting of a High-Level Ultimate God and four Primary-Level Ultimate Gods to avenge her, but they were miserably defeated,” said the white-robed commander.

“Really? Is she that powerful? Did you say she’s just a Primary-Level Ultimate God?” Shi Qianhan seemed hopeful.

“Of course she’s just a Primary-Level Ultimate God,” the white-robed commander smiled and continued, “The issue became worst such that the leaders were alarmed. We decided not to act rashly and we investigated her origin instead. We later discovered that she’s from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion!”

“Dragon Phoenix Pavilion!” Shi Qianhan was taken aback. “Is that the group which only accepts the cream of the crop as their members?”

The white-robed commander smiled and nodded. “Yes. After discovering her identity, the commanders were shocked and immediately ordered those members who provoked her to apologize, and the matter was finally put at rest.”

Shi Qianhan finally understood after the explanation.

He had also heard of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. If the Ancient Witch was part of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion, no one would dare to nettle with her. Even the Northern Darkstar Territory’s Territorial Lord would not dare to offend her.

“In terms of strength, Ancient Witch has defeated a High-Level Ultimate God before. She’s much more powerful than the army’s Primary-Level Ultimate Gods. If you can seek her help, you won’t have to worry about Jian Yi winning the Blood Gladiators Challenge.” The white-robed commander sneered.

“That’s true. However, the Shi Clan has no connections with her who had such a great background. Why will she help me?” Shi Qianhan frowned.

“You’ll have to try hard and offer her something great in return. I’ve heard the Ancient Witch is especially fond of competing with other genius experts. If you tell her there’s someone in the Gladiatorial Arena who’s in the same realm, but with similar if not better combat prowess than her, she might be tempted to fight. Provided there are some rewards added as well,” said the white-robed commander.

Shi Qianhan’s eyes immediately lit up. “Haha, thank you for telling me about her.”

Shi Qianhan did not delay any longer and set off to meet the Ancient Witch.

...

Jian Wushuang was waiting patiently on the huge and almost borderless Gladiatorial Arena with his eyes closed.

The more than a hundred thousand spectators around were also waiting. They knew the Shi clan must be looking for a strong expert to join the final battle.

The expert invited must be very powerful seeing how long they had to wait. This in turn would make for a more exciting Blood Gladiators Challenge finale.

Everyone waited for almost a day before an usher finally entered the Gladiatorial Arena while guiding a black-clothed lady with a somewhat menacing appearance.
