Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the battlefield, the battle was still raging like wildfire.

However, when God extinguisher clashed with the four heads of the Black Lightning Beast condensed on Palace Master Nan Wu’s body.

That terrifying might attracted the gazes of all the experts on the battlefield.

“That’s...”

“What a powerful power! !”

“It’s one thing for Palace Master Nan Wu to be able to display such power, but that sword one’s technique is actually so tyrannical?”

“What a fellow. With such an intense collision of power, I’m afraid that we advanced great divine paragons would be killed the moment we get close. Even the weaker peak great divine paragons would have no choice but to retreat under such a collision.”

The experts from both sides were secretly amazed.

All of them looked at the place where the two forces collided with horror in their eyes.

In the center of the battlefield, under the cover of endless golden divine power, a pitch-black thunderbolt suddenly swept out. It was like a black saber cutting through the golden divine power ocean. Then, Black Thunderbolts surged wildly in the sky.

Jian wushuang’s full-strength divine destruction move was actually blocked by palace master Nan Wu.

Judging from Palace Master Nan Wu’s current posture, she was only a little embarrassed, but her aura was not weak at all.

“Sword one, is this your strongest move?”Palace Master Nan Wu looked at Jian wushuang with lightning-like eyes.

“Strongest move? No, it’s not.”Jian wushuang shook his head lightly. “That move just now is far from enough.”

Palace master Nan Wu’s expression changed. In the next moment, as if he had sensed something, he immediately raised his head.

When he raised his head, his pupils suddenly shrank.

He saw that in the sky above him, in the scroll world that had always existed in the sky, a surge of supreme power had slowly descended.

A huge handprint slowly descended from the scroll world.

The mountain and river map was the nine-region seal and the thousand treasures great world.

He had perfectly displayed the power of the thousand treasures great world.

With the help of the sword principle world of the thousand treasures great world, his swordsmanship was so powerful that he was able to fight Palace Master Nan Wu.

What Jian Wushuang was displaying now was the power of the other secret skill, the nine-region seal.

The nine-region seal was the true power of the nine-region seal.

The hand seal that was slowly descending from the scroll world was the divine emperor seal that Jian Wushuang had mastered by combining the first three moves of the nine-region seal!

“This move...”palace master Nan Wu’s expression changed slightly.

He was under the giant hand seal, so he could clearly sense the destructive power contained in it.

The power was much more powerful than the two giant golden palms that Jian wushuang had slowly closed in on him and severely injured him!

It was really much more powerful.

He could easily resist the two golden palms that had slowly closed in on him.

But now, the giant handprint that fell from the sky made him feel a little apprehensive.

However, it was merely palpitating.

Palace Master Nan Wu had dominated the pill sun sacred world for so many years. He had always been known as the number one expert of the Pill Sun Sacred World. His true strength was not as simple as that.

After the enormous hand seal slowly descended, palace master Nan Wu’s expression suddenly sank. After which, a black lightning seal suddenly appeared between his brows. The moment this Black Lightning seal appeared.., swoosh! A large amount of black lightning energy crazily swept out from the mark. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This black lightning energy was stronger and darker than Palace Master Nan Wu’s God body.

Then, this Black Lightning energy formed a second layer of black lightning armor on his body.

“Thunder Beast, Kirin! !”

Palace master Nan Wu shouted, and the Black Lightning Energy in the sky swept up again. A huge ancient strange beast condensed around his body. This ancient strange beast was one of the top bloodlines of the absolute beginning divine realm, the Kirin Strange Beast.

At this moment, this Kirin Strange Beast, which was completely formed by the Black Lightning Energy, threw its head back and roared furiously, as if it was venting its unwillingness.

In the next moment, the Kirin Beast dashed out and fiercely collided with the huge palm print that descended from the void above.

Boom! Boom!

The world shook.

The violent power formed a turbulent wave that swept out in all directions.

The experts fighting on the surrounding battlefield were already quite far away from the place where Jian Wushuang and palace master Nan Wu were fighting. Logically, it should have been difficult for the battle between the two to spread to other battlefields.

However, as the Kirin Beast collided with the giant palm, the terrifying power swept in all directions. The battlefields that were closer to them were all swept away. These powerful great divine masters.., they were so weak under the power that they were blown to all directions. It took them a long time to stabilize themselves.

In the center of the battlefield.

“Pa!”

With a crisp sound, a crack appeared in the center of the Kirin-type exotic beast that was completely condensed from the Black Lightning Energy. Then, the entire body of the exotic beast collapsed, and the Black Lightning energy that filled the sky also dissipated into thin air.

Palace Head Nan Wu’s expression sank, and a mouthful of blood flowed out from the corner of her mouth. Her body also trembled slightly.

However, the giant palm that had descended from the sky had completely dissipated.

“Injured? You actually injured me?”

Palace Master Nan Wu felt that her divine body had suffered some damage, and endless fury immediately surged in her eyes.

A surge of shocking anger rushed to the sky and earth.

“Don’t worry, there’s more.”Jian wushuang smiled coldly.

“What?”Palace master Nan Wu’s expression changed and he raised his head again.

As expected, a strong power slowly spread out from the lifelike scroll world above.

Rumble

This power was obviously stronger than when Jian Wushuang had used the divine emperor seal.

Then, a huge palm appeared.

It was much bigger and more powerful than before.

Most importantly, when this huge palm descended from the scroll world, a huge figure appeared in the scroll world in the sky.

It was an emperor wearing a royal robe and a crown. He was extremely tall, more than one million feet tall and more than ten million feet tall.

His figure was blurry, and his appearance couldn’t be seen. However, the aura he carried seemed to attract people’s attention.

It was the aura of a true emperor!

Only the emperors of Heaven and earth, the rulers of the world, had the aura of a true emperor.

And that huge palm was the display of this emperor’s figure. It was the strongest two of the three seals of the nine regions seal of the mountain and river map... The True Emperor Seal!
