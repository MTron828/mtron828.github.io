Chapter 633: Xuan Yi’s Token!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Ancient Sect?”

“Master Xuan Yi?”

All the people were startled!

All the geniuses here had carefully read the information on the sects and clearly understood the Ancient Sect’s position among the sects in the Firmament Territory.

Although it was one of the top nine sects, the Ancient Sect was stronger than the three magnates in many ways.

Especially when it came to cultivating disciples, the Ancient Sect surpassed the three magnates. Otherwise, it could not have produced so many experts.

It could be said that the Ancient Sect’s appeal to these geniuses was no less than that of the three magnates.

Master Xuan Yi?

He was the strongest person in the Eternal Realm in the Firmament Territory, with an outstanding level of strength and identity.

This same person, Master Xuan Yi, not only personally watched this genius battle from the Skyward Pavilion, but even directly offered tokens. But he gave those six tokens to the six people from the Ancient World instead of the top geniuses from the Eternal World.

What was going on?

Even the six people, including Jian Wushuang, were a bit confused, not to mention the geniuses from the Eternal World.

Although they could hardly believe it, Jian Wushuang and others still accepted the tokens, at which point they heard a message.

“I am Xuan Yi, from the Ancient Sect!”

“The performance of the six of you in the genius battle is very good. The third round will be very important. After that, I will decide whether to accept you as a disciple of the Ancient Sect, so I hope that you will display your full strength in the third round.”

The message was simple and did not directly invite them to join the Ancient Sect. However, after receiving the message, the six geniuses, including Jian Wushuang, became greatly excited.

“The Ancient Sect!” Huo Ying clenched his hands with burning eyes.

“I thought it would be good enough if there was a top sect willing to accept me as an outer disciple.” Bing Shan, who wore a white robe and had a cold expression, stuck out his tongue and licked his lips.

“The Ancient Sect?” Feng raised his head as his eyes narrowed slightly.

The geniuses of the Eternal World looked over at Jian Wushuang and the other five with a little jealousy.

“It’s the Ancient Sect!”

“Even we are not eligible to be invited by the Ancient Sect, but these six people from the Ancient World actually got tokens from Master Xuan Yi.”

“When it comes to talent and strength, Feng is the strongest among the six people from the Ancient World, but he can only rank in the top 20 among us. And for Wu Huang, Jian Wushuang, Bing Shan, and Xuan Ying, they are at bottom among us. How could they also receive a token from Master Xuan Yi himself?”

“What exactly is going on in the mind of Master Xuan Yi and the Ancient Sect?”

This question not only bewildered these geniuses,?it also puzzled the experts from the sects.

“Mr Xuan Yi is interested in the six little guys from the Ancient World?” The evil girl from the Boundless Demon Sect asked telepathically with a bit of doubt.

“Ha ha.” Xuan Yi didn’t hide his thoughts and spoke directly, “We, the Ancient Sect, value geniuses, but there are two kinds of geniuses. the first type are the ones who possess excellent talent while the second are the ones whose minds are as firm as a demon. Personally, I prefer the second type.”

“Compared with those geniuses from the Ancient World, these geniuses who were born in the Eternal World have too many innate advantages. They’re endowed with unique advantages and can easily reach the Skyscraping Realm. It’s very seldom that they encounter obstacles or go through hardships, so they tend to have a bad temperament.”

“But those little guys from the Ancient World are different.”

“The cultivation condition in the Ancient World, which is a plane world, are pretty bad. There are numerous warriors in a plane world, but few people are able to reach Skyscraping Realm. Anyone who makes it had to face endless setbacks. Their wisdom has already matured and it’s not an exaggeration to say they’re quite clever.”

“The Eternal World is deadly and dangerous. If someone wants to survive in it, a good temperament is the most important asset to have.”

After Xuan Yi finished the sentence, quite a few of the sect experts in the Skyward Pavilion agreed with him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Temperament was indeed extraordinarily important for surviving in the Eternal World.

Of course, there were some people who were displeased with his words.

“Xuan Yi, we’re here to choose talents. The reason why we choose them is to make them experts who can support our sects. We aren’t choosing them to help them live a long life,” The black-haired elder from Cloud Sea Asgard sneered.

“That’s what Cloud Sea Asgard is doing. The disciples in our Ancient Sect only cultivate to live happily and leisurely. Whether we’re strong or weak, it’s enough if we can keep living happily,” said Xuan Yi.

“Hmph, that notion isn’t right. No wonder you can’t become the fourth magnate in the Firmament Territory,” the black-haired elder sneered and said. “In that case, it will be enough for you to take away those six little guys from the Ancient World.”

“If you don’t compete with us, then we’ll accept all six of them,” Xuan Yi immediately said.

“That’s fine then, you can have them. They’re merely six little guys from the Ancient World.” The black-haired elder was dismissive.

“Since Mr. Xuan Yi wants those six little guys, we, the Boundless Demon Sect, will definitely give you face.” The evil girl from the Boundless Demon Sect spoke directly.

“We, the Immortal Dynasty, aren’t interested in those six little guys at all. Since Mr. Xuan Yi wants them, I won’t compete with you, either.” The arrogant middle-aged man from the Immortal Dynasty also agreed.

“Well then, thank you, all of you.” Xuan Yi gave a faint and mysterious smile.

On the Drill Ground, the 124 talents who had passed the second round of the genius battle were quietly waiting for invitations from the sects.

There were indeed many white-robed people flying out of the Skyward Pavilion in a row at first, representing the sects and delivering invitations. But the invitations quieted down after half an hour.

After that, under the surprised gazes of these geniuses, a lot of experts flew out of the Skyward Pavilion and immediately left.

“Why did they all leave?”

The geniuses were all confused.

As this moment, the middle-aged man that was presiding over the conference spoke again.

“After the second round, it will be a month before the third round begins. I’ll take you to a place where you can rest for this month.”

Hearing this, the geniuses couldn’t help wondering.

The third round of the genius battle wouldn’t be on until a month from now?

“Take us to a place?”?Jian Wushuang cocked his eyebrows.?“Where will he take us?”
