Chapter 1536: Strength Oriented (Explosion Began!)

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Zi Dongwang had led by a wide margin at the beginning but later on, he had encountered hindrances one after another. He would meet an obstacle in every move. When the one hundred move time limit was up, Zi Dongwang had only solved five-hundred-and-forty-five moves.

Although the result was considered good amongst Universe Gods, it was not aligned with his ranking on Universe God ranking list.

After all, among all Universe Gods, there were many who had solved more moves than he had and there was a total of fifty-seven of them!

With such a result, Zi Dongwang was so embarrassed that he wished there was somewhere he could hide.

In the lofty hall.

“Lei Chao, congratulations.”

“There is really a great disciple in Lineage of Star.”

“Not only did Lineage of Star receive nine White Blaze Fruits, but you also receive a White Blaze Fruit Tree too. Hehe, all the benefits are taken by Lineage of Star.”

Real Gods from each force and sect, including the Almighties, were looking at Lei Chao.

The gazes were rather complicated.

There was envy, jealousy and even greed.

Being watched by the burning gazes, even Lei Chao’s facial expression grew strange, he didn’t reply to the people before him, nor could he reply to them. He immediately sent an update to Hall Master Yuan.

“Yuan, hurry up and inform Palace Master. Request him to stop his cultivation and rush here,” Lei Chao sounded in a hurry.

“You want Palace Master to stop his cultivation?” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows, “Although Jian Wushuang got nine White Blaze Fruit from Wu Bei’s cave, the Almighties won’t take action against him for the few pieces of White Blaze Fruit without concern for their reputations, right?”

“If it were only a few pieces of White Blaze Fruits, there’d be no need for Palace Master to come on his own. But the thing is that Jian Wushuang got a White Blaze Fruit too. It’s a White Blaze Fruit Tree. Its value is equal to a few hundred White Blaze Fruits. Such a precious treasure… I don’t think the Almighties can stand the temptation. If Palace Master were to not come personally, I reckon the Almighties will fight over it at the very moment Jian Wushuang exits the cave,” Lei Chao said.

“White Blaze Fruit Tree?” Hall Master Yuan was shocked at first then quickly grew excited. “Jian Wushuang got a White Blaze Fruit Tree?”

“Yes. There’s a total of three White Blaze Trees in Wu Bei’s cave and he got the first one,” Lei Chao said.

“That’s great. Let me inform the Palace Master now,” Hall Master Yuan’s voice was obviously delighted.

Very soon, Hall Master Yuan came before the most mysterious cave dwelling in the boundless Milky Way.

“Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan stood outside the cave dwelling as he bowed politely.

“What’s the matter?” There was an ancient and deep voice from the cave dwelling.

“This is what happened…” Hall Master Yuan immediately told the story.

“White Blaze Fruit Tree? The little guy from Lineage of Star got it?” A surprised voice traveled from the cave dwelling. In the next moment, the entrance of the cave dwelling was wide-open. A white-haired ancient figure slowly walked out.

“I never knew that Lineage of Star had such a chance.” The white-haired elderly muttered. “A White Blaze Fruit Tree is worth a trip.”

Just as he said that, the white-haired elderly moved and suddenly vanished from the universe.

Hall Master Yuan was surprised at the sight. He immediately sent Lei Chao a message, “Lei Chao, Palace Master has already departed personally. However, even with Palace Master’s power, he’ll require a few days to get to Wu Bei’s cave from Star land. Tell Jian Wushuang to not leave from Wu Bei’s cave before Palace Master gets there personally.”

“Mm,” Lei Chao nodded heavily and there was a great commotion in his heart but he looked rather composed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As for the jealous, greedy gazes from the surroundings, he didn’t worry.

He knew for sure that as long as Palace Master came personally, no matter how greedy the people were, no one would dare to cross the line.

In the cave.

“The first test has ended!”

The blurry image of Real God Wu Bei overlooked the Universe Gods. In the end, his gaze fixed onto Jian Wushuang, “A Universe God who is able to solve six hundred and seven moves in a hundred years’ time. You, are doing very well. You will definitely get one of the three chances in the end.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly to Real God Wu Bei.

“Then, let’s begin the second test,” Real God Wu Bei said and he waved. There were immediately a few space tunnels that appeared in the air in the void above the open ground.

“The second test is in the space tunnels. As for the context of the test,?it is much easier than the first test. You’ll see your opponent the moment you enter the space tunnel. What you need to do is to fight your opponent. The longer you last in the fight, the better.

“Actually, to be straightforward, the second test is to test your respective powers. Whoever is stronger will be able to get the second White Blaze Fruit.”

After hearing what Real God Wu Bei said, the faces of the Universe Gods on the open ground grew strange. They couldn’t help but look at one person.

The person was God Destroying King!

God Destroying King who everyone was looking at smiled too.

Strength?

Strength Oriented Test?

One should know that God Destroying King was widely recognized as the number one Universe God in Eternal Chaotic World.

His strength was no doubt the strongest.

The second test had yet to start but everyone already knew the final result.

“We don’t have to compete for this test!”

“A test relying entirely on strength. Who is capable enough to win against God Destroying King? Even Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang couldn’t be compared favorably with God Destroying King.”

Many Universe Gods sighed with emotion.

If Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were to team up, they could really win against God Destroying King. However, one-on-one, they were definitely not God Destroying King’s match.

Both of them had a thorough knowledge of themselves.

“It seems that we don’t stand a chance in the second test,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“We don’t, but I’d really like to compete with you in this test,” Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and immediately understood Duan Lingfeng’s plan.

“If so, let’s do it,” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily.

In the second test, he and Duan Lingfeng didn’t stand a chance. No one could fight against God Destroying King.

Not for the White Blaze Tree, but to compete with one another. They would try their best to get through the test.

In the void, Real God Wu Bei spoke, “In order to save time, there is no need for everyone to join this test. In the Eternal Chaotic World, isn’t there a Universe God ranking list? Whoever is on Universe God ranking list can try to challenge. The rest can skip this.”
