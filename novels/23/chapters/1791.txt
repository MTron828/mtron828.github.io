Chapter 1792: Shocking Change

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The courtyard was in total silence.

Before everyone’s gazes, a man and woman walked forward slowly.

Jian Nantian with silvery-white hair gave out a unique aura. He extended his hand to pat Jian Wushuang’s shoulder.

“It’s great to have you back,” Jian Nantian smiled.

Looking at his smile, Jian Wushuang felt his body and mind relax.

Then, Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng sat in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was surprised as he noticed his father’s aura.

The aura was the strongest out of everyone’s at the scene.

“Universe God in the Second Heaven?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

Forget about the fact that there were many Universe Gods in the First Heaven. His father had become a Universe God in the Second Heaven?!

“Father, everyone, what happened? How can all of your powers increase so tremendously? The spiritual energy in this battlefield, how did it become this intense?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Listening to Jian Wushuang’s questions, everyone exchanged a look and Wang Yuan laughed, “Old Three, we must give credit to your master for the battlefield’s transformation.”

“My Master?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and he instantly responded, “Could it be the formation that my Master created?”

“Yes, that formation,” Wang Yuan smiled, “Fifty thousand years ago, your mysterious master disappeared but he passed you a formation. Then, you and Palace Master Yun from Green Fire World, and also the higher-ups, set up the formation.”

“Then, the formation became the biggest defense for Green Fire World. Without Green Fire Palace’s permission, no one could barge into the battlefield. Scenes like the invasion of Jin Kingdom definitely won’t happen again. However, the power of the formation doesn’t just stop there.”

“After the formation was set up, which was after you left, the battlefield, including the spiritual energy in Green Fire World, slowly became more intense under the influence of the formation. In the beginning, the spiritual energy didn’t increase much but as time went by, the spiritual energy grew more and more intense. Now, the spiritual energy in the battlefield has increased by a thousandfold compared to before!”

“As for Green Fire World… The battlefield gave birth to Green Fire World and the transformation was even greater!”

“You don’t know. The spiritual energy in Green Fire World is three times more intense than the battlefield.”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He could feel that the intensity of spiritual energy in the battlefield could be compared favorably with the ten sanctuaries.

But Green Fire World was three times stronger than the battlefield?

How intense would it be?

“The cultivation environment in Green Fire World already overtook the ten sanctuaries?” Jian Wushuang muttered in disbelief.

“Besides, although the spiritual energy is much stronger than before, the battlefield, including Green Fire World, is in constant change. The intensity of the spiritual energy is constantly rising.”

“Such intense spiritual energy naturally raises the probability of experts. Hence, in the fifty thousand years that you were away, there was a big bunch of experts that flourished in Green Fire World. Fifty thousand years ago, Doctrine Masters were already considered as the top experts in Green Fire World. However, in Green Fire World now, there are Doctrine Masters all over. It was nothing.”

“Even Heaven Master is not considered as a top expert in Green Fire World. Those who were qualified to stand at the peak would be Universe Master and Universe Gods.”

“Now, Green Fire World has more than thirty Universe Gods. However, they are mostly Universe Gods in the First Heaven. Only your father alone is extremely talented and stepped into Universe God in the Second Heaven,” Wang Yuan said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jian Wushuang was amazed.

The cultivation environment determined the standard and quality of expert from a place. Then, the cultivation environment in Green Fire World was much stronger by a few hundred, even a few thousand times. Naturally, the experts born were many more.

Plus, there were many cultivators in Green Fire World but they didn’t have anyone to guide them?

Previously, the strongest in Green Fire World was only a Universe Master. As for anything above Universe Master, no one knew how to cultivate or improve.

They had merely depended on themselves to explore and comprehend. At most, they could receive some pointers from the surrounding ancient battlefields but the pointers weren’t complete.

Under such circumstances, Green Fire World could reach such a level in fifty thousand years. If they were to receive complete guidance from Universe Gods, Real Gods or even Almighties, and they continued to propagate in the next ten thousand or a hundred thousand years, just how great would it be?

Jian Wushuang was already amazed by the thought itself.

“Jian Wushuang, your hometown might stand a chance to become a new sanctuary, or even higher!” King of Venomous Worms’ solemn voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang took another deep breath and calmed himself down from the surprise.

“Oh yeah, it has been so long. I didn’t know you happen to visit too. Where’s Old Two? Also, Tang Emperor and Uncle Xiao? Why aren’t they here?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

However, the moment he brought up about Old Two, Wang Yuan and Su Rou’s faces stiffened.

The surrounding people’s faces changed.

“Why?”

Wang Yuan, Su Rou and the other people at the scene naturally couldn’t hide from Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “What happened?”

“Old Three,” Wang Yuan paused and then clenched his teeth as he said, “Old Two, he died.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

“Not just Old Two, but also Emperor Tang and Emperor Xiao. Both of them died too,” Wang Yuan continued.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t hold back anymore when he heard that.

“Died? Old Two, Emperor Tang and Uncle Xiao died? How is it possible?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bloodshot. His roar reverberated in the courtyard and he looked almost mad.

He couldn’t be blamed. The three people that had died were too important to him.

Old Two, Yang Zaixuan, was his brother!

The same had happened to Wang Yuan and Su Rou, they were sworn brothers and sisters. They had been through life and death situations and shared an intimate relationship.

Uncle Xiao, also Emperor Xiao!

When he was weak, Emperor Xiao had treated him with kindness. Besides, he had another identity. He was also Leng Rushuang’s father, his father-in-law!!!

As for Emperor Tang, he was the founder of Tang of the East, he was also one of the most ancient experts in Green Fire World.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had yet to rise up and there had only been five Universe Masters who were in commanding positions. Among the five of Universe Masters, there were four who had died? Only Emperor Tang was alive. He was the only survivor.

Then, even the last ancient existence had died too?

“Who was it?”

“Who killed them?”

Furious. Jian Wushuang was filled with rage.

Jian Wushuang was raging with anger.
