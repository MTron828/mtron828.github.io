“One is Real God Cheng Tian from Soaring Heaven King Palace. As for the other one…”

Jian Wushuang looked at the other cold-looking elder and squinted his eyes, “The resentment between Soaring Heaven King Palace and I have nothing to do with you, Real God Shi Gu.”

“Hehe, it really had nothing to do with me. However, Soaring Heaven King Palace paid a great price and I am really interested in you, an inverse cultivator,” the cold-looking Real God Shi Gu smiled maliciously.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “It seems that the fight between Soaring Heaven King Palace and I is inevitable regardless.”

“That’s funny. You killed two Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace. For that incident alone, you deserve to die!” The red-robed handsome man, Real God Cheng Tian roared.

“I deserve to die? I will wait then,” Jian Wushuang didn’t care. As he spoke, there was a fierce aura that soared from his body.

“Mm?” Real God Cheng Tian’s face changed, “Something’s not right.”

“Why?” Real God Shi Gu asked.

“His aura, it’s an aura that an Eternal Real God would have. Jian Wushuang already broke through and became an Eternal Real God!” Real God Cheng Tian exclaimed in surprise.

“What?” Real God Shi Gu was shocked too.

From what they knew, Jian Wushuang had only broken through and become a Void Real God not too long ago. Just how many years had it been since he had already reached the level of Eternal Real God?

“Previously, he was only a Void Real God and he could kill Real God Zi Ye. Now that he has broken through again, his power has definitely increased tremendously. He might be able to compare favorably with experts on Real God ranking list. With just the two of us, we can’t do anything about him. Let us retreat for now. When the other experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace arrive, hem him in and kill him together,” Real God Cheng Tian said.

Real God Shi Gu looked unhappy. Although he was upset, he nodded heavily.

He wasn’t stupid either and he wouldn’t make fun of his own life.

“Retreat!”

The two top Chaotic Real God immediately retreated and they obviously wanted to give up the idea to fight Jian Wushuang.

But, just as they turned and wanted to leave…

“The two of you don’t need to run!” A cold voice suddenly resounded in their heads.

Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu looked at everything in front of them in shock. They saw that Jian Wushuang, who was originally far away from them, had taken one leap and appeared in front of them like a bolt of lightning, leaving countless shadows behind him.

“This speed…” Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu were astonished.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang lifted his hand. He didn’t draw his sword but merely punched them.

“Rumble.”

It was a simple punch but it contained an extremely terrifying diving power and it continued to magnify itself in front of them.

The divine power alone made the two top Chaotic Real Gods quiver in fear. There was an unprecedented terror in their eyes and they tried their best to withstand it.

Then, they made a final struggle and performed their attacks but they were still suppressed by the punch. In the end, they could only watch as Jian Wushuang’s fist swung at them.

“Hall Master, Jian Wushuang…” Real God Cheng Tian didn’t even send one a complete message in time.

“Bang! Bang!”

The fist was magnified by a few folds. Then, it landed on both Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu’s heads at the same time. Instantly, both of their heads popped.

The two top Chaotic Real God instantly died.

“Divine power comparable favorably with an Almighty. It’s pretty easy to kill an ordinary Chaotic Real God,” Jian Wushuang looked at the two cold dead bodies that fell as a smile spread across his face.

He didn’t use any skill on purpose with the earlier punch, merely his own divine power.

He had merely suppressed them using his divine power and the two top Chaotic Real Gods had been eliminated.

That was the huge difference in power between an Almighty and a Chaotic Real God.

“As the two Real Gods saw me, I was definite that they sent my location to Soaring Heaven King Palace. It seems that, in no time, they’ll be other experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace here soon,” Jian Wushuang smiled as he took all the treasures from the two Real Gods into his own Qian Kun ring.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, come on!”

…

Soaring Heaven King Palace, in a lofty palace.

“Real God Cheng Tian sent a message. They saw Jian Wushuang!” Soaring Heaven King Palace Master

“That’s great!”

“I finally found that son of a b*tch!”

“They found Jian Wushuang. How about Zi Ye?”

The higher ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace in the hall became anxious.

“Real God Cheng Tian only saw Jian Wushuang but didn’t see Zi Ye around. If I’m not mistaken, Zi Ye should have passed.”

A golden-robed man who looked cold raged furiously, “Jian Wushuang killed two Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace. Regardless, he has to die! Send down my command, all experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace must immediately rush to where Real God Cheng Tian is.”

“Yes!” There was someone who took the order immediately to send down his command.

“Hold on!” The golden-robed man suddenly waved and there was anger in his eyes. He had received the incomplete message that Real God Cheng Tian had sent before he had died.

“Real God Cheng Tian has already died. Besides, Real God Shi Gu, who was with him in the Eight Lair, should be dead too,” the golden-robed man said in a low voice.

“What?” The higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace who were standing at a lower platform were angry.

“Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu were both top Chaotic Real Gods. With the two of them joining forces, unless one was an expert that possess fighting power of an expert on Real God ranking list, it would definitely be impossible for him to kill two of them in such a short period of time. Jian Wushuang possibly already possesses the fighting power of one on the Real God ranking list. Maybe he has other experts around him who have the fighting power of one on the Real God ranking list,” the golden-robed man said coldly.

“Send my command down. Tell all experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace to not take action recklessly before gathering enough power. Do not fight with Jian Wushuang. Even if Jian Wushuang takes the initiative to find them, try to avoid him. Wait until we gather a formation that is sufficient to kill him, then we will hem him in. Also, tell Han Quan to return from the Sixth Lair and head over to the Eighth Lair together to kill Jian Wushuang!”

“And, tell them that from Real God Gu Ying to Real God Zi Ye, and now Real God Cheng Tian, we Soaring Heaven King Palace has three Chaotic Real Gods that died in Jian Wushuang’s hands. It is a great humiliation to Soaring Heaven King Palace. If Jian Wushuang doesn’t die, where will Soaring Heaven King Palace’s dignity be?”

“Hence, in the next fight, not only should we kill Jian Wushuang, we also have to show our dignity. We have to let Sanctuary Alliance and all forces in Eternal Chaotic World know what is the outcome of offending Soaring Heaven King Palace. In the fight, no matter what kind of obstacle we run into, with the involvement of experts from Lineage of Star, we should hold no scruples and kill everyone!!!”
