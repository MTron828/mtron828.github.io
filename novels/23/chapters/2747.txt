Chapter 2748: A Windfall

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang calmed down and looked at the second treasure—the baby-sized Black Beast Statue.

“This statue...”

Jian Wushuang looked at the statue, but could not understand it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He felt an extremely powerful destructive force from the statue.

The destructive force was astounding.

The baby-sized Black Beast Statue seemed to come alive under Jian Wushuang’s gaze as though it was sleeping quietly.

“This is such an unusual Beast Statue... Although I can’t figure it out, it should be a Destruction Law-based Premier Treasure. It must be extraordinary for it to be placed in the same Interspatial Ring as a Holy Treasure defensive armor,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang moved on from the statue to the third treasure—the dark gray jade slip.

Jian Wushuang instantly understood the function of the jade slip with the influx of his soul power.

“Teleportation! It’s teleportation!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The jade slip was imbued with a technique—a teleportation technique!

Teleportation—instantaneously moving from one space-time to another.

An expert could execute such means once their perception of Space-time Law had reached an extremely high level.

Many Undying Saints who were good at Space-time Law including those Undying Saint experts were not qualified to utilize such methods.

It was a highly sophisticated method with an extremely high requirement on Space-time Law understanding. In the Ancient God Domain, few Undying Saints could perform the method. They were the best of the best Undying Saints who were truly invincible!

Whoever could perform a teleportation method was no doubt a peak expert.

It was no doubt an excellent life-saving method.

An Undying Saint who could perform a teleportation method could easily run away from a Law Lord not well-versed in Space-time Law under normal circumstances and the Law Lord would not be able to catch up.

Even when used for normal transportation purposes, simply relying on one’s feet to move around was completely different from using a teleportation method.

It was why countless experts were envious of those who could perform teleportation methods. Unfortunately, it was a method mastered by exceptional experts who were good at Space-time Law.

Jian Wushuang’s understanding of Space-time Law was far from being able to perform a teleportation method. However, the jade slip in his hand was imbued with a teleportation method. As soon as he smashed the jade slip, the teleportation method would kick into effect and immediately teleport him to another place.

In other words, the jade slip was an excellent life-saving method.

“Three treasures—Holy Treasure Moire Battle Armor, the Destructive Law-embedded baby-sized Black Beast Statue, and life-saving jade slip containing a teleportation method...” Jian Wushuang shuddered.

The value of those three treasures was amazing.

Among those three treasures, the Moire Battle Armor and Beast Statue were of no use to him.

Although the jade slip was equivalent to an additional life-saving trump card for Jian Wushuang, it could only be used once.

In the future, he could crush the jade slip and escape if he was in a desperate situation—a life and death crisis that he could not resolve.

However, it did not guarantee absolute success.

Saber Master who was driven to desperation by Jian Wushuang did not crush the jade slip in the end.

It was useless to crush the jade slip in the first place because he was in a different space-time.

He was in a secret realm under the influence of a unique space-time method that nullifies the jade slip’s teleportation method.

If he similarly met a top expert who was good at Space-time Law outside the secret realm, the jade slip’s teleportation method might not be able to help him escape.

Nonetheless, those three treasures were pleasant surprises for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had gotten too many treasures in one go in addition to the Golden Feather Phantom Mirror, Purple Imperial Bell, and Holy Treasure Battle Saber.

In addition, Saber Master, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Devilish Wind King were Grand Ultimate God experts and wealthy—especially Saber Master, who was the leader of a faction within the Crimson Stone Fort. The numerous resources those people once possessed fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

There were also a couple of corpse puppets...

Devilish Wind King had previously obtained a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. Hong Chen received four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets where Jian Wushuang had killed two of them while the other two were still in great shape. Those corpse puppets had now fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After he properly refined those corpse puppets, they would be controlled by him.

Those corpse puppets had the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God, a powerful High-level Grand Ultimate God, and two ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods after all!

Not forgetting, Jian Wushuang had received five Golden Huangji Pills at the beginning that were of equally extraordinary value.

After adding all those treasures... Jian Wushuang had made a windfall fortune!

“It’s indeed a fortune—a windfall fortune!”

Jian Wushuang was over the moon over the surprises.

Soon, he managed to recover from feeling surprised before starting to refine those corpse puppets in the cave.

Although no one was controlling those corpse puppets, it would still take a while for Jian Wushuang to refine them.

It was not too bad since had Jian Wushuang tried to refine the Moire Battle Armor or the Holy Treasure defensive armor, it would have taken a much longer time and he had no idea when it would be completed.

Therefore, it explained the reason Saber Master was unable to use the Moire Battle Armor in the duel against Jian Wushuang as he did not have time to refine it.

A month soon passed.

The four corpse puppets were finally refined and completely under Jian Wushuang’s control.

“I have strong combat power on hand from today onward.

“A Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets, Old Snake, and myself... My Sword Alliance combat power should be comparable to Danyang Continent’s top forces when based purely on the highest Grand Ultimate Gods’ combat power, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He knew that there were a lot of activities occurring in the Danyang Continent under the radar which placed Yin Su’er in a very difficult situation.
