4199 The Undercurrent Surges

“Yes.”

Ruler Whitefloat nodded his head. He did not use any divine power and instead walked up the stone stairs step by step.

A moment later, Ruler Whitefloat walked to the top of the stone stairs. There was a strange pavilion that was completely red.

He pushed open the door of the pavilion. Inside the spacious pavilion, there was no light. A thin old man was sitting cross-legged on the head seat of the pavilion, half of his face hidden in the darkness.

!!

“Hall Master.” Ruler Whitefloat respectfully bowed.

“Eh? Whitefloat, what’s wrong with your face?” A hoarse voice came from the skinny old man.

When Ruler Whitefloat heard this, a look of humiliation flashed across his eyes. Gritting his teeth, he replied, “Palace Master, this is all thanks to Ruler Blood Wave of the Divine Life Palace.”

“Blood Wave?” The scrawny old man was surprised and asked, “I know Blood Wave. He’s an easy person to get along with among the Supreme martial artists. Why would he attack you? Are you the one who offended him?”

Upon hearing these words, a venomous look appeared on Ruler Whitefloat’s face as he said, “Hall Master, you don’t know this. The people from the Divine Life Palace are really arrogant. They don’t even respect the Great Void Temple…”

Ruler Whitefloat immediately recounted his experience in the Divine Life Palace, adding a lot of details to the story.

The Divine Life Palace that he had talked about was arrogant and domineering, taking advantage of the situation to bully others. However, it was completely different from his actual experience.

The scrawny old man listened silently and did not reply. After Ruler Whitefloat finished speaking, he shook his head and said, “Alright, I understand. You may leave.”

Ruler Whitefloat’s face turned anxious as he hurriedly asked, “Hall Master, are we just going to let it go like this…?”

Without waiting for him to finish, the skinny old man squinted his eyes and interrupted, “I said I got it, did you not hear me clearly?”

“…”

Ruler Whitefloat fell silent for a moment before cupping his hands and replying, “Then, Whitefloat will take his leave first.”

After saying that, Ruler Whitefloat turned around and walked out of the hall.

However, after he turned around, his expression suddenly became even gloomier and more ruthless.

After a while, the pavilion fell into silence.

The skinny old man raised his head and suddenly looked at the pitch-black void and sighed, “Palace Master Bing Ye, what should we do next?”

Chi chi chi.

The air twisted and a silver-haired child around seven or eight years old appeared.

The child was about seven or eight years old. He had red lips and white teeth. However, he had silver hair and silver eyebrows. His eyes revealed a maturity that did not match his age.

No one would have thought that this handsome and adorable child was the first Hall Master of the Great Void Temple, Supreme Bing Ye!

“Hmph, let’s not talk about the exaggeration in Whitefloat’s words for now. Supreme Gai Fu of the Divine Life Palace is an ancient figure from the same era as the divine Emperor. Even I have to treat him with the respect of a junior when I see him. He’s already very lucky to be able to come back alive!” The silver-haired child sneered and shook his head. His gaze then fell on the skinny old man’s face and he said, “Jiu Kun, I heard that you were the one who chose this Deputy Hall Master? You have bad taste this time.”

The scrawny old man sighed and replied, “Whitefloat is actually a good person, except for his love of adding oil and vinegar.”

After a pause, the skinny old man changed the topic and continued to ask, “Palace Master Bing Ye, there’s one thing that Whitefloat was right about. Are we just going to let the matter of the Divine Son go like this?”

“What else do you want to do?” Supreme Bing Ye shook his head and said, “The Grand Tribe Ceremony is about to begin. I heard that during this grand ceremony, that lord will distribute 10 seats in the universe and choose 10 people to listen to his lecture. Our top priority now is to fight for a place for our Great Void Temple among these 10 seats. Other matters are not as important as this.”

“What? Ten seats?” The scrawny old man was shocked and said, “In the last Grand Tribe Ceremony, didn’t that lord only distribute seven seats? Why are there so many of them this time?”

Supreme Bing Ye pondered for a moment before saying, “When I was on the ancient path of stars, I heard someone say that his lordship is going to choose three of the most talented of the universe’s Ultimate Rulers to sit on his seat. That’s why there are three extra seats for him to listen to the Dao.”

“Palace Master Bing Ye, now that the Divine Son is dead, does that mean that our Great Void Temple has no chance of winning the three seats of the Ultimate Ruler?” The scrawny old man pondered for a while and said with a frown.

Upon hearing this, Supreme Bing Ye smiled faintly and said, “Don’t worry. Our Divine Emperor has already made arrangements for the candidates for the Ultimate Ruler’s seat. The Divine Son is just a substitute.”

“Oh?” The scrawny old man seemed to have thought of something when he heard this. He suddenly raised his eyes, and the divine light in his eyes grew three inches.

“Could it be…Sir Divine Emperor is planning to release Qiu Long?”

Supreme Bing Ye smiled mysteriously and did not reply.

….

At the same time, it was not just the Great Void Temple. Top powers like the Great Sun Divine Kingdom and the Da Feng Divine Kingdom also received news of the deaths of the heaven’s favorites who were sent to the Tarot Ruins.

After some investigation, a name ‘Jian Wushuang’ came into their sight.

Within the first Prince’s residence in the Da Feng Divine Kingdom.

An extremely handsome young man wearing a violet-golden void python robe was standing in front of a railing with his hands behind his back.

In his hand, he held a black light mirror. The image reflected in the mirror was the moment when Jian Wushuang had killed the Third Prince.

His face was full of pain as he muttered to himself, “My dear third brother, I told you not to go to the Tarot Ruins, but you insisted on going. Look at you now, you’ve died in someone else’s hands. Why don’t you listen to my advice…?

“Why? Why did you do that?”

“You should have died in my hands!!!”

As the young man spoke, he suddenly laughed in a low voice.

His handsome face was filled with joy. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After a while, he calmed down and looked down at the scene of Jian Wushuang killing the Third Prince in the dark light mirror. He laughed evilly and said, “Jian Wushuang? Very good. To thank you for helping me get rid of my third brother, I’ve decided to kill you.”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, the mystic light mirror shattered into pieces.

The young man released his hand and looked into the distance with a cold smile.

…

The Divine Life Palace, the fourth mountain range, the river of enlightenment…

‘Jian Wushuang, you deserve to be killed!’

‘Damn Jian Wushuang!’

“Release me! I’m going to fight you to the death!”

“Argh! Jian Wushuang, try to kill me again if you have the ability.”

Bang!

A sword light flashed, and the river of enlightenment quieted down.
