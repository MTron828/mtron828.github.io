Chapter 1565: Powerless

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Where did this old bastard come from? Eat my hammer attack!”

A fierce shout could be heard. It was from the leader of the mountain bandits and he was swinging a giant iron hammer around. He then jumped off from the horse and immediately headed toward Jian Wushuang violently.

The leader of the mountain bandits was a true martial artist with remarkable abilities.

Jian Wushuang could not dodge in time and he could only use his sword to defend himself. In the end…

Bam!

A loud clashing sound could be heard and the longsword in Jian Wushuang’s hands was sent flying. At the same time, he felt that the skeleton of his body was about to break into pieces from the impact. In addition, he also spit out a big mouthful of blood and his body retreated continuously. It was only after retreating a total of ten steps that he managed to regain his posture. However, what followed after that was a tired feeling and his body fell backwards involuntarily.

In the instant he fell down, he saw that some mountain bandits had charged into the bamboo house that Chen Hu and his family were in.

“No!”

Jian Wushuang roared madly in his mind. It was a furious roar as he felt a dissatisfaction that he had never felt before.

However, he could not do anything as his body could no longer take it at that moment.

Even his consciousness went into a deep sleep slowly.

…

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness finally woke up after an unknown period of time.

As soon as he woke up, he felt the extreme pain from his body. After that, he saw everything in the surrounding area and it was too tragic to look.

The whole Chen family village had become a pool of blood.

Jian Wushuang stood up slowly. Everywhere he looked there were pools of blood and a great amount of bodies strewn around randomly. These bodies were the clansmen of the Chen family village.

The Chen family village was gone.

The whole village had been massacred.

“Why did this happen?” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and his old face started to become distorted.

What a great village it had been that many people had yearned for. What honest clansmen there had been.

The day before, it was still a peaceful village. In the blink of an eye, it had become a sea of blood.

Moreover, everything happened in front of Jian Wushuang. However, he was unable to stop it.

Powerless!

It was the first time that Jian Wushuang felt so powerless.

From the start of his training until that very moment, he had also experienced numerous thresholds and hardships. However, he had never felt as powerless as he was at the very moment.

Without any abilities, he was just a normal person!

He could only look on as the villagers were completely massacred by the mountain bandits.

At the very moment, Jian Wushuang’s heart was filled with rage and even his body was trembling madly.

However, his expression changed abruptly, “Hu Zi.”

Jian Wushuang headed to Chen Hu’s house, the bamboo house, immediately.

After entering the bamboo house and witnessing the scene inside, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Within the bamboo house, Chen Hu, Chen Qiu and Chen Hu’s mother were all lying in a pool of blood.

In particular, Chen Hu’s mother was still hugging both Chen Hu and Chen Qiu tightly.

Jian Wushuang squatted down slowly and loosened Chen Hu’s mother’s hands while suppressing the shaking in his heart.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes moved. He could feel Chen Hu’s breath. He was still breathing slightly.

“There’s still hope!”

Jian Wushuang took out an elixir from his Qian Kun Ring immediately.

Although he had lost all his abilities, his treasures were still with him. He did not have any treasures to bring the dead back to life with. However, as long as there was still breath, he could bring Chen Hu back to life.

After the elixir had entered Chen Hu’s body, he recovered from his condition immediately. In just a short amount of time, he opened his eyes.

However, when he opened his eyes and saw the scene in front of him, he became stupefied.

Straight away after that…

“Mother!! Xiao Qiu!!”

“No, no!!”

Chen Hu shouted continuously and tears came out of his eyes immediately.

Jian Wushuang frowned as he saw this. After that, he took a deep breath and said seriously: “Hu Zi, let me ask you. Do you wish to take revenge?”

“Take revenge?” Chen Hu was stunned but he clenched both his fists tightly, “I wish to. Of course I wish to take revenge. I wish to kill that group of bandits completely and not leave even a single one of them alive!”

“If you wish to take revenge, wipe away your tears. From today on, you shall follow me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” Chen Hu nodded his head without thinking. At the same time, he used both his hands to wipe his tears.

“Let’s go. We should bury your mother and little sister.”

Together, Jian Wushuang and Chen Hu brought the bodies of Chen Hu’s mother and Chen Qiu to the back of the mountain, which was the forest in which Chen Hu had seen Jian Wushuang for the first time.

“Now, wait for me for a while.”

After Jian Wushuang had finished talking, he returned back to the Chen family village.

As he stood in the pool of blood at the Chen family village, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked toward the empty sky, “I know that there should be an expert of the Green Feather Pavilion nearby. Although I don’t know whether you are a Universe God or Real God…”

Jian Wushuang took out a Qian Kun Ring with a wave of his hand, “Inside this Qian Kun Ring, there are ten million Chaos Gems. I hope that you can help me to bury the villagers of the Chen family village properly.”

Jian Wushuang placed the Qian Kun Ring above a stone and left after that.

Not long after Jian Wushuang had left…

Swoosh!

A shadow descended abruptly, appeared beside the Qian Kun Ring and took it.

This person was naturally Elder Ming Ba of the Green Feather Pavilion.

Elder Ming Ba had remained hidden all the while. His duty was to not allow Jian Wushuang to die in the Sky Blue mystery land. As for what Jian Wushuang had experienced within the mystery land, he did not care about it. For example, Ming Ba was not concerned about the massacre that the Chen family village had experienced in the slightest.

A group of commoners was only a group of ants. Therefore, they were not worthy enough for him to take action. Moreover, he would not participate in the fight between the commoners.

Although Jian Wushuang was seriously injured, as long as he was not dead, Elder Ming Ba would not take action.

Jian Wushuang had paid the price of ten million Chaos Gems to get him to give the village a proper burial. Thus, he appeared at that very moment.

Then, in accordance to Jian Wushuang’s request, he buried the villagers of the Chen family village.

At the back of the mountain, inside the forest.

Even though Jian Wushuang and Chen Hu had teamed up, they still spent many hours burying Chen Hu’s mother and Chen Qiu properly.

“Hu Zi, from today on, you shall follow me and I will teach you spear skills!” Jian Wushuang looked at Chen Hu.

Chen Hu was extremely emotional. In the next moment, he knelt down immediately and kowtowed to Jian Wushuang respectfully, “Greetings to Master.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Master?” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “I did not say that I would take you on as my disciple. However, if you wish to call me Master, by all means do so.”

“Follow me.”

Jian Wushuang brought eight-year-old Chen Hu with him and headed to the deepest part of the forest.

From that day on, Jian Wushuang started to teach Chen Hu wholeheartedly.

Although he had lost his abilities, he had knowledge and experience that no one in the mystery land had. Not to mention that Chen Hu, who he was currently teaching, was only an eight-year-old child. Even if it were those martial artists who stood at the top in this world and were equal to the Eternal Chaotic World’s Doctrine Masters and Heaven Masters, Jian Wushuang could still teach them effectively.

Time passed by and ten years passed in a flash.
