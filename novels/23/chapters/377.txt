Chapter 378: Accepting a Disciple

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?” Lin Lan looked at Jian Wushuang in a surprise.

“I only said it was possible, but I am not sure,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had confidence in the Heavenly Creation Skill, but there were exceptions in everything, so he was not sure.

Lin Lan took a deep breath, then she looked at Jian Wushuang again.

Plop!

Lin Lan was kneeling directly in front of Jian Wushuang.

“I beg you, Mr. Swordsman, please remove the Witch Poison. I, Lin Lan, am willing to be your follower for the rest of my life!” Lin Lan said in a serious manner.

“Follower?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew what being a follower meant. It was equivalent to master and servant.

In the vast Divine Land, some top experts occasionally had one or two followers around them.

Lin Lan, in order to get rid of the Witch Poison, was even willing to become Jian Wushuang’s follower. It could be imagined how much the Witch Poison had tortured her.

“Forget about being my follower.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and continued, “From the time I started practicing swordsmanship, until now, I have never had a disciple. If you are willing, you can become my first personal disciple starting today.”

“Personal disciple?” Lin Lan immediately became pleased by hearing this. Then, she respectfully kowtowed to Jian Wushuang.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

Having kowtowed consecutively three times, Lin Lan got up and said, “Disciple Lin Lan pays her respects to Master!?”

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

He had been alone since the beginning of his cultivation. Now, he finally had a disciple.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was very fond of this disciple.

It was not only because Lin Lan was very much like him and had similar experiences as him. The most important part was Lin Lan’s temperament.

I’d rather die than surrender!

In addition, Lin Lan had excellent talent in both cultivation and Sword Principle. Moreover, the Origin she comprehended was the World Origin. He was satisfied with Lin Lan in all aspects. Naturally, he could accept her as a disciple.

“Get up.” Jian Wushang waved his hand. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yes.” Lin Lan got up, with a very humble attitude.

Lin Lan also felt quite blessed to be Jian Wushuang’s personal disciple.

Although she did not know how powerful Jian Wushuang’s strength was, she had just competed with him and he had defeated her in a single strike, without using any Spiritual Power.

This level of ability alone was enough to make Lin Lan completely admire him.

Jian Wushuang sat down on the rock bench beside him, while Lin Lan also sat in front of him and stretched out her arms.

Jian Wushuang held out his hands and placed them on Lin Lan’s wrists. A stream of Spiritual Power entered Lin Lan’s body through the pores on her wrists and began exploring her body.

It only took a moment for him to find the Witch Poison that was hidden in Lin Lan’s body.

“Oh my god!”

He was looking at the dark black Witch Poison that was hiding in Lin Lan’s lower abdomen, which had a parasitic relationship with her Dantian. Jian Wushuang could not help admiring it.?“It’s like a Parasite that feeds on the Spiritual Power within her Dantian, and it can be said that it has integrated with her Dantian. It is impossible to completely dispel the Witch Poison unless breaking her Dantian. It’s no wonder so many experts and alchemists could do nothing about this Witch Poison.”

“Master, is there a way?” Lin Lan was nervously looking at Jian Wushuang, with some expectation.

“Be patient,” Jian Wushuang said while smiling slightly.

“Don’t resist,” Jian Wushuang ordered. Then a steady stream of Spiritual Power directly poured from Jian Wushuang’s hands, into Lin Lan’s body, and gathered at her Dantian. Once it had accumulated to a certain level, the Spiritual Power immediately headed towards the dark black Witch Poison.

The Witch Poison could not be separated from Lin Lan’s Dantian, nor could it be forcibly removed. Therefore, Jian Wushuang’s only choice was to try to refine it while it was still in Lin Lan’s body.

However, the refinement went much smoother than that of the Icy Heart Poison.

“Although the Witch Poison’s parasitic method is a somewhat special, its toxicity is vastly inferior to Leng Rushuang’s Icy Heart Poison.”?Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. In only a moment, most of the Witch Poison in Lin Lan’s Dantian had been refined by him.

Half an hour later, the Witch Poison had been completely refined by him, at which point he suddenly stopped wielding his Spiritual Power.

Puff!

Lin Lan directly spat out a mouthful?of black blood, which was all that remained after the Witch Poison had been refined.

“Your Witch Poison is gone,” Jian Wushuang said in a cool way.

Hearing this, Lin Lan was stunned for a moment.

“Here, this is an elixir that is originally used to restore strength. Take it and try circulating your Spiritual Power.” Jian Wushuang passed Lin Lan a brown elixir.

Without any doubts, Lin Lan accepted the brown elixir and immediately took it, then she sat down beside him.

A moment later, a great aura of Spiritual Power began to spread from Lin Lan’s body, increasing at an amazing speed.

Lin Lan’s Cultivation, which had fallen to the level of the Profound Yin Void Realm today, had begun to improve. From the Profound Yin Void Realm, to the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, then the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, after which she started trying to enter the Initial Yang Void Realm.

Two hours later, Lin Lan’s breath slowly calmed down. At this moment, her Spiritual Power had recovered to the Profound Yang Void Realm!

She was now one level higher than she was earlier today when her cultivation began to regress.

“Sure enough, my Witch Poison has been completely removed.” Lin Lan opened her eyes, which now contained a flash of ecstasy.

Lin Lan looked at Jian Wushuang, then she knelt on the ground once again and solemnly said, “Thank you for giving me this second chance, Master!?”

“Get up.” Jian Wushang waved his hand.

Lin Lan stood up, and her state of mind slowly regained its calm, but there was still a faint trace of joy in her eyes.

“Your cultivation had already reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm before. It was only because of the Witch Poison that you regressed, so It should not be difficult to completely recover. Here are three pills that are useful for restoring your cultivation. For the next three days, you should swallow one pill every day. In three days, your strength should be completely restored,” Jian Wushuang said.

In the past, he had destroyed the Holy Emperor Palace and killed the four Holy Masters by himself. Hence, the countless treasures accumulated in the Holy Emperor Palace over the thousands of years had fallen into his hands, among which there were various elixirs and pills. The pills given to Lin Lan were all second-grade and of great value.

“Thank you so much, Master.” Lin Lan pleasantly accepted the pills.

“I heard that your Lin family will have a hunt in three days?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Yes,” Lin Lan solemnly nodded and said, “Our Lin family holds a hunt every year. Not long ago, the senior family members decided to marry me to Luo Hai of the Luo family. This matter should be announced at the hunt.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows, then he stood up and walked slowly towards his courtyard.

Lin Lan looked closely at Jian Wushang’s back. Only when Jian Wushuang was about to disappear completely from her sight, did a cold voice reach her ears.

“Just do whatever you want to do!”

“Your Master will take care of everything, even if the sky begins to fall!”

Hearing this, Lin Lan’s eyes gleamed and she immediately clenched her fists.
