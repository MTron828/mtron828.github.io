Chapter 524: East Camp

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Monster Continent, there were the north, south, east and west borders in the human group’s territory. Each border had one military camp, with the camps respectively named the North, South, East and West Camps.

These four camps were like huge stones that shielded the human group from harm.?For a long time, numerous Demonic Beasts had tried to invade the Human Territory but had been defeated by warriors and experts from the four camps.

The East Camp was one of the four camps!

There were thousands of experts in the East Camp. Here, a Six-cloud Realm (superior lord) was only an ordinary warrior. A Divine General could be a leader of a 10-soldier squad, while only a Second-grade Divine General was qualified to be in charge of a 100-soldier squad.

Ten 100-soldier squads formed one army, which was led by an advanced Second-grade Divine General.

Beyond that, there were the generals (Divine Emperors) and the Temple Masters who were at the top of the hierarchy.

It was said that there were more than three Temple Masters and about ten generals in the East Camp.

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo were both assigned to be in the East Camp and in the same army.

As Jian Wushuang was a Second-grade Divine General, he was designated the leader of a 100-soldier squad. Qing Huo was a First-grade Divine General, so he led a 10-soldier squad. Qing Huo’s position was one level lower than Jian Wushuang’s.

At the present moment, both of them were in one of the camps.

“Fang Han commander, I hope I can count on you.” A red-haired man with a saber strapped to his back sat on a long narrow table holding a wine bowl.

Opposite the red-haired man, a plump middle-aged man smiled and said, “Jin Ling brother, you’re too humble. I don’t think anyone in the East Camp would dare to provoke you. After all, your father is the Emperor Golden Snake and is one of the generals in our camp.”

“Don’t worry about that. From now on, as long as I get some good news in the Seventh Army, I will share with you.”

“Thanks, Fang Han commander. I would like to propose a toast to you,” the red-haired man said with a smile.

If Jian Wushuang had been present, he would have immediately recognized Jin Ling, with whom he had previously had conflicts with in the Heaven Wing City.

After Jin Ling became a Divine General, he had applied from the Monster-exterminating League to join the Military Camp. Since his father was in the East Camp, he had been assigned to the same camp became a leader of one 100-soldier squad in the Seventh Army.

The plump middle-aged man, Fang Han, was the commander of the Seventh Army. Technically, he was Jin Ling’s boss. However, since the Emperor Golden Snake was Jin Ling’s father, Fang Han was very humble to him.

In the camp, Jin Ling and Fang Han were enjoying their conversation while drinking. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, a sergeant walked into the camp and said respectfully. “Commander, the leaders of a 100-soldier squad and a 10-soldier squad are here.”

“Who are they?” Fang Han asked.

“The leader of the 10-soldier squad is called Qing Huo. He stayed in the East Camp before, but was not in our army. As for the leader of the 100-soldier squad, his name is Jian Wushuang. He was only recently designated a Second-grade Divine General,” the sergeant answered.

“Oh?” Fang Han raised his eyebrows.

“Jian Wushuang?” Jin Ling’s expression changed abruptly.?His face filled with hatred as he mumbled to himself. “It’s him!”

“What’s the matter, Jin Ling brother, do you know him?” Fang Han looked at Jin Ling.

“He’s been in my thoughts. It’s such a coincidence that he has been assigned to the East Camp and also to the same army as me,” Jin Ling’s expression was glacial as he gave a forced smile.

The smile was as sharp as a blade.

“Jin Ling brother, it seems you have an axe to grind with Jian Wushuang?” Fang Han smiled slightly as he looked at the sergeant. “You can leave but tell Jian Wushuang that I am busy now, ask him to wait for me outside.”

“Yes,” the sergeant departed to convey his order.

Fang Han and Jin Ling were left alone in the camp again.

“Fang Han commander, about Jian Wushuang... I might need your help,” Jin Ling said.

“Jin Ling brother, there’s just us here. Please speak plainly.” Fang Han squinted at Jin Ling.

“Hum, I would love him to die!” Jin Ling answered with a cold voice.

“Oh?” Fang Han raised his eyebrows, hesitated for a moment and said, “The sergeants in the Human Territory are already in danger. Any careless mistake will result in their deaths. It will be easy to get rid of Jian Wushuang.”

“How about this, since he is in my army, I’ll assign some dangerous and deadly tasks for him to handle. What do you think?”

“No,” Jin Ling shook his head. “Dangerous tasks are always accompanied by good rewards. It’d be nice if he is killed while carrying out the task. But if he isn’t, he will benefit from the rewards.”

“So, what is your plan?” Fang Han frowned and looked at him.

“Hum, Jian Wushuang is here is to kill the Demonic Beasts and get the Monster Cores, but I am not going to let it happen. Fang Han commander, don’t we need someone to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains?” Jin Ling asked.

“The Sky Solitude Mountains?”

Fang Han narrowed his eyes. He knew what Jin Ling meant, so he smiled and said, “The Sky Solitude Mountains is behind the East Camp. The Demonic Beasts will need to get past the defense of the East Camp before they can reach the Sky Solitude Mountains. Usually, only monster spies are able to get there.”

“Even if the monster spies get there, the Sky Solitude Mountains is vast. Besides, there is only a 100-soldier squad standing guard there, so it is hard to detect any spies. It’s also a desolate landscape so it’d be hard to get any Monster Cores there.”

“OK, then let’s follow this plan. I would love Jian Wushuang to get not even one Monster Core while he is in the East Camp!”

“Sure,” Jin Ling sneered.

“Fang Han commander, thanks for following the plan. I’m leaving now,” Jin Ling said.

“No problem. Your enemy is my enemy, I know how to make him suffer,” Fang Han smiled.

Jin Ling nodded and then left the camp.

Outside the camp, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo stood in silence as they waited.

“Fang Han commander should be talking to someone, so let’s wait for a while here.” Qing Huo said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded patiently.

Soon, they saw a figure emerge from the camp.

When they saw who that person was, their expressions both changed.
