Chapter 526: Give an inch but take a mile

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Sky Solitude Mountains stretched for hundreds of thousands of miles. It was almost as huge as the eight million-mile-long Flaming Battlefield where Jian Wushuang had been to before.

A 100-soldier squad guarding such a vast territory played a negligible role.

For the next few days, Jian Wushuang and his squad did not spot any Demonic Beasts or monster spies during their patrols.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t do anything about his situation. As he didn’t expect to get any Monster Cores in the Sky Solitude Mountains, he started to improve his strength.

“I have already reached the bottleneck of comprehending the World Origin and the Slaughter Origin, so it might be impossible to break through them and condense the Ninth Origin Mark in a short duration of time. However, I could still try to improve my Sword Principle!”?Jian Wushuang considered his options.

From then on, in addition to patrolling the Sky Solitude Mountains, Jian Wushuang also spent time cultivating his swordsmanship and Sword Skills.

Like the Heart-killing Sword Technique and the Multifold Realm, there was still plenty of room for him to improve.

It was quiet in the Sky Solitude Mountains and the experts in Jian Wushuang’s squad were also a bit idle. Compared to the 100-soldier squads in the East Camp who were constantly fighting Demonic Beasts, there was a huge difference.

In a flash, one month had passed.

“It is already one month, finally we can leave this desolate place,” Qing Huo and Jian Wushuang were excited.

This month had been very boring for Qing Huo and the sergeants in the 100-soldier squad.

They had been guarding the mountains for a month and finally the month had passed.

“If everything goes well, there should be another 100-soldier squad coming to take our place soon,” Jian Wushuang said. Qing Huo stood and waited in silence.

Half a day passed and yet there was still no sight of a new 100-soldier squad. Finally, an ordinary sergeant appeared and passed a message to them.

“The commander said that they had a fight with the Demonic Beasts a few days ago. Many squads suffered losses, so now we have a lack of manpower. This month, we can’t arrange for a new squad to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains. The tenth 100-soldier squad will continue to stand guard here.”

Without waiting for their reactions, the sergeant turned and left.

“How could that be?”

The sergeants from the tenth squad were furious.

“Not going to replace us? How is that possible?” Qing Huo frowned and looked angry, “This is the East Camp’s rule. Every month, a new 100-soldier squad is supposed to stand guard here. Why are they not making the change this time?”

“Manpower shortage?”

“Hum, that’s nonsense. It would be good for those squads suffering manpower shortages to stay in this desolate place. They wouldn’t even need to fight with any Demonic Beasts.”

Qing Huo growled, “I am pretty sure that Fang Han is doing this intentionally to make us suffer. It’s also very likely that Jin Ling is involved in this.”

“Otherwise, why did the commander ask us to stay in the Sky Solitude Mountains when we had just arrived at the East Camp? Besides, the previous squad had been here for less than ten days.”

“Jin Ling?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and said, “That’s very possible.”

After a month in the East Camp, he had learnt that Emperor Golden Snake, one of the East Camp’s generals, was Jin Ling’s father.

As a general, he had lots of power. Jin Ling was Emperor Golden Snake’s only child, and so was held in esteem by the commanders in the East Camp. Of course everyone would support him.

“Brother Wushuang, what’s your plan?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang.

During the month spent on the mountains, he had built a good relationship with Jian Wushuang. Before, he had called him Friend Wushuang, but now, he called him Brother Wushuang.

“Let’s wait for one more month,” Jian Wushuang answered in a low voice.

“We still can’t be sure that Fang Han is making us suffer, so let’s tolerate this for one more month. If they still don’t follow the rule next month...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were flinty.

He did not want to cause trouble but was unafraid of doing so.

Fang Han was the commander and also his boss. Jian Wushuang could accept it if Fang Han merely wanted to challenge him. However, if the commander was intentionally making things difficult for him, he would not suffer in silence.

“Fine, then let’s wait one more month,” Qing Huo nodded solemnly.

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo spent lots of time pacifying the sergeants. Finally, the tenth 100-soldier squad resigned themselves to stay in the Sky Solitude Mountains for one more month.

In a flash, another month had passed. It was time for the squad rotation.

However, no one showed up.

At sunset, all the sergeants in the tenth 100-soldier squad were in a dark mood.

“It’s been two months and there’s still no squad coming to replace us. Not even a messenger showed up. What’s wrong with this picture?”

“I would be bored to death if things keep going like this. I would rather be a guard in the Eight Cities, or in the Holy Place, or even be a messenger than stay in this desolate place. It’s already two months. It’s deserted here.”

“I heard that our leader has upset someone in the East Camp, that’s why the commander assigned him to stay in the Sky Solitude Mountains. It’s obvious that the commander wants him to suffer.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Really? Who did he upset?”

“I heard that he is the son of a general in the East Camp.”

“What a bunch of bastards, using their power to exact revenge.”

All the sergeants were angry.

Jian Wushuang had his hands crossed behind his back as he stood on a hill watching the sunset.

“At least they sent a messenger last month. This month, not even one appeared,” Jian Wushuang’s face was clouded over.

“Brother Wushuang.” Qing Huo approached him and said, “It’s already the second month, the sergeants are all frustrated. Several squad leaders and I are trying to pacify them, but it’s not really working.”

“I can understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and said, “Qing Huo, please tell the sergeants to stay here for one more night. Tomorrow I will talk to Fang Han.”

“Are you going there by yourself?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Don’t worry, I will be fine,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled coldly.

“All right, then I will leave,” Qing Huo left to console the sergeants.

Jian Wushuang stood on the hill and murmured, “Fang Han and Jin Ling... I have tolerated you for a month. I made concessions but you took advantage. You really think I am a coward.”
