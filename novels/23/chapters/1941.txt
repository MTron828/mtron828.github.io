1942 The Seventh Palace Master!

Hong!

On the battlefield, Duan Lingfeng was already fighting with the cold-looking elder.

Although the cold-looking elder was a Sir God, Duan Lingfeng was number one on Real God ranking list. He was powerful enough to fight with him. He would definitely not be defeated in a short period of time.

“Mister, you said that Mister Duan is the number one Real God in Eternal World. The person that is fighting with him now seems to be slightly stronger than him. Could he be the legendary Almighty?” Luo Tianhong couldn’t help but ask. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Yes, an Almighty,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“He really is,” Luo Tianhong gasped.

To cultivators who stayed in their Holy Kingdoms all year round, an Almighty was definitely like a figure from the legend.

“Mister Duan who is only a Real God can fight with a legendary Almighty like that. He lives up to his reputation as the number one Real God in Eternal World,” Luo Tianhong complimented.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s fight. Otherwise, your best friend might not be able to endure for long,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

King of Venomous Worms immediately moved and returned to Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Qiu Yue, stay on the spaceship with this young man,” Jian Wushuang exhorted.

“Yes,” Qiu Yue nodded.

Then, Jian Wushuang and Jian Yi flew to the huge floating land.

Just as they landed on the land… Rumble. A terrifying divine might flowed out of Jian Wushuang’s body.

The power of the divine might was stronger by tens of folds than the full divine might shown by the cold-looking elder.

The divine might was like a prison as it engulfed the entire land.

The cultivators on the land, including the men from Soul Snatching Palace, were terrified.

With such terrifying divine might, it finally startled the expert who was hidden in the deepest place of the land.

Then, there were fierce auras that burst out from the depth of the land, also known as the old lair of Soul Snatching Palace. A few figures appeared one after another.

They gathered with the cold-looking elder. There was a total of seven figures floating in the air.

Just like seven Gods.

“So many of them?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

He knew that there were experts from Holocaust Sect within Soul Snatching Palace and there might even be Almighties. However, he had never expected that in Soul Snatching Palace itself, they hid a total of seven Almighties!

Most importantly, among the seven Almighties, there were not only Sir Gods. There were only four Sir Gods and the other three were Emperor Gods!!

Three Emperor Gods and four Sir Gods, that was the powerful team formation in front of Jian Wushuang.

Among the three Emperor Gods, the one leading was a golden-robed man with a crimson monstrous mask. The golden-robed masked man stood there and pressed down on Jian Wushuang with pressure. Without a doubt, the golden-robed masked man was a true peak Emperor God!!!

“Interesting. Such a minor force like Soul Snatching Palace is impressive enough to contain seven Gods. There’s even a peak Emperor Gods,” Jian Wushuang smiled. His smile was cold like a blade.

The seven Almighties stared at Jian Wushuang.

The pair of eerie golden eyes that were revealed by the golden-robed masked men were looking at Jian Wushuang as he let out boundless resentment.

“You are… Jian Wushuang!!!” The golden-robed man sounded cold and the air froze in an instant.

“You know me? It seems that I am quite famous in Holocaust Sect,” Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose.

“I am the seventh Palace Master of Holocaust Sect!” The golden-robed masked man stared at Jian Wushuang as murderous intention swept out, “Jian Wushuang, I finally found you. Give me my son back!!”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Your son? Could it be His Highness Mu Hong?”

Although Jian Wushuang had crossed paths with Holocaust Sect multiple times, the only expert from Holocaust Sect that died had at his hand was His Highness Mu Hong.

Plus, Jian Wushuang had always thought that His Highness Mu Hong had a background. From what it seemed, he should be his father, the golden-robed masked man before him.

“With a peak Emperor God as his father, no wonder His Highness Mu Hong would be so arrogant,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Save your nonsense. I will take revenge on my son’s behalf today!”

“Die!”

The golden-robed masked man bellowed and his peak Emperor God aura instantly locked onto Jian Wushuang as his target. His body immediately increased tremendously in size to ten zhang tall. His golden robe turned into boundless golden clouds.

Rumble. A huge golden mountain appeared in the sky above.

The golden mountain continuously magnified and pressed down on everything in the universe. That very moment, it pressed down on Jian Wushuang.

Looking at the golden mountain above him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

As the golden mountain pressed on him, he could clearly feel a suppressing power.

If not mistaken, the golden mountain should be a suppressing treasure that was rare. Plus, the power had reached the level of Chaotic Divine Treasure.

“Chaotic Divine Treasure is rare to begin with. A suppressing Chaotic Divine Treasure is even harder to come by,” Jian Wushuang muttered. Even he felt danger approaching when he was under the golden mountain.

“My seven stars are all broken. My power of ancient tribe bloodline has just recovered by a slight bit and my power isn’t at its peak. I am at a disadvantage when I am fighting with the seventh Palace Master who has suppressing Chaotic Divine Treasure.”

Jian Wushuang thought and immediately looked at Jian Yi next to him.

“Take care of this person. Kill him!” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“Yes,” Jian Yi nodded politely and there was immediately a crimson cloud churning on his body.

There was crimson fog that gathered in the sky and instantly formed a crimson ocean to engulf the entire huge golden mountain.

The golden mountain displayed its power that was fierce. However, when it hit the crimson ocean, it as though it had hit a ball of cotton.

“What?” The golden masked man, also the seventh Palace Master couldn’t help but steal a glance at Jian Yi.

However, Jian Yi didn’t stop and his figure grew illusionary and charged towards the seventh Palace Master.

“Humph!”

The seventh Palace Master humphed coldly. When Jian Yi got closer, he took out a huge seal with a flip of his wrist.

On the huge seal, there was a golden dragon that carried a powerful aura. It was an extremely unique Chaotic Divine Treasure.

As the seventh Palace Master patted the seal, the seal let out an intense golden glow. The golden dragon on the seal instantly became alive.

“Roar!!!”

A terrifying dragon roar reverberated in the universe.

The golden dragon suddenly became tens of thousands of zhang in length. It contained boundless imposing power as it charged at Jian Yi.

The golden dragon gave Jian Wushuang a feeling that it could match evenly with an ordinary Peak Emperor God.

“This seventh Palace Master has so many treasures on hand?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.
