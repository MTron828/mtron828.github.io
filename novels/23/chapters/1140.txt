“I knew I’d cause a commotion when I break through but I didn’t expect it to be so great!”

Shocked, Jian Wushuang watched the aftermath of his breakthrough unfold from the palace atop the mountain.

It was common for a person making a breakthrough to cause a commotion but Jian Wushuang’s was on another scale.

His majestic aura could cause even Celestial Masters to shudder, not to mention mere Dao Masters.

“Such an impact when I’m just a Dao Master. Wonder what will happen when I become a Celestial Master or something more powerful…” Jian Wushuang began to look forward to seeing such a scene in the future.

He could also sense great changes taking place in his body as his aura completely transformed.

The change was a kind of metamorphosis.

His body—his bones, muscles, cells, and even breaths—had undergone an innate metamorphosis.

“It feels so good.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in admiration.

It was such a comfortable and relaxing process that he could not help submerging himself in.

The metamorphosis lasted for nearly half a day until everything finally calmed down.

His magnificent and valiant aura also gradually calmed down and the whole world was quiet again.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and slowly stood up.

Just then, a cracking sound came from his body. He had obviously sat here for less than a day but he felt as if he had stayed here for thousands of years or even longer.

“So, this is how it feels to be a Dao Master.”

Jian Wushuang subconsciously looked down at his palm. He spread his fingers and made a fist.

“Crack!” He crushed the space near his hand into smithereens and caused an explosion in the air. He could clearly feel how explosive his power was.

“I already have the sturdy body of a Three-star Ancient God of Imperial Kinsmen but my body feels several times stronger now. In terms of Spiritual Power, I think I’m more than ten times stronger!” His eyes glinted with golden light.

Undoubtedly, there was a large gap between an Eternal Realm expert and a Dao Master.

He was dozens of time stronger in terms of Spiritual Power alone. Being an Inverse Cultivator, it was natural for him to burst with Spiritual Power after becoming a Dao Master.

More importantly, he now commanded better control over his Daos and their power would naturally be stronger as well.

This was particularly true for Jian Wushuang who became a Dao Master with the help of the strongest Sword Principle. If he unleashed the might of his Dao, he would be very formidable.

“Powerful. I feel so powerful!” His eyes gleamed with delight.

He had never felt this powerful in his entire life.

He felt fearless enough to confront even a Universe Master.

“Hurry and check how you’ve changed after becoming a Dao Master.” Gu King urged.

“Right.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Being both a practitioner of the Heavenly Creation Skill and an Inverse Cultivator, his every step was in defiance of the natural order. Naturally, the outcome would be extraordinary as well.

He would, of course, be different from ordinary warriors.

When he was still in the External Realm, he was equipped with the ability of an Everlasting Realm expert. He was strong enough to defy heavens.

Now that he was a Dao Master—the fourth step in defying the natural order of the Heavenly Creation Skill, dubbed Eternal Supremo—there ought to be changes in him.

Jian Wushuang began to carefully examine himself.

“Oh, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He detected a strange black flame in his sea of consciousness out of nowhere.

It was faint as if it might be snuffed at any minute. However, he could feel a special power coming from this flame. It was greatly similar to his consciousness.

“Is that… Soul Fire?” Gu King cried in a weird voice.

“Soul Fire?” Jian Wushuang asked in confusion.

“Impossible! That’s impossible!” Gu King’s voice was frantic. “You’re a mere Dao Master! How can you have Soul Fire?”

“Impossible! That’s absolutely impossible!”

“When King Luo Zhen almost reached the topmost level of the Eternal Chaotic World, he finally managed to light his Soul Fire after making great efforts and paying a great cost. You… You’re just a Dao Master. You’re far from being as powerful as King Luo Zhen. Why… Why can you light your Soul Fire?”

Jian Wushuang became speechless from amazement.

He knew little about Fire of Soul but judging from Gu King’s reaction, it must be something extraordinary.

“Inverse Cultivation is truly a monstrosity!”

“Considering how monstrous it is, no wonder Heavenly Laws disallow it!”

Gu King continued to be in shock for a long time before he finally calmed down. However, his emotions remained complicated.

“Gu King, what’s going on? What’s Soul Fire?” Jian Wushuang asked, finding it to be strange.

Gu King was momentarily silent before he answered in a cold voice, “Kid, you got lucky!”

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Well, Soul Fire is evolved from your consciousness. I’m sure you’re able to sense how the strange power in your Soul Fire is in complete harmony with your consciousness.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang gave a small nod.

“That’s the Soul Power evolved from your consciousness,” Gu King explained.

“You should be clear how strange and wondrous a person’s consciousness can be. You can even call it illusory for it can’t take tangible form despite existing in one’s mind. For example, your consciousness attack is immaterial. Basically, your consciousness isn’t tangible.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded. One’s consciousness, without a shape or size, could not be substantial.

“However, when a person becomes strong enough to a certain level, his consciousness will gradually get take shape and finally evolve into a complete soul. Meanwhile, the power of consciousness will metamorphize into Soul Power.”

“Soul Power is far stronger than consciousness. It can be materialized into anything. Some top experts in the Eternal Chaotic World can turn their Soul Power into magic weapons for battles, form doppelgangers, or more. But that’s an incredibly difficult skill!”

“Is it that powerful?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.
