Chapter 1225: The Fire Puppet!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was in a dark, vast expanse.

This was the Oblivion Palace; the site where Jian Wushuang had fought against the Celestial Master Malignity in a fierce and furious duel.

It was in the dark hemlock of the huge darkness in the Oblivion Palace that Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies, Jian Nantian and the Sunrise Sword Emperor were standing together.

A token hung in mid-air before them. In it was the instructions to operate the Quadruple Supreme Sword Formation.

“This is the Quadruple Supreme Sword Formation? A formation that combines our attacks into one?” Jian Nantian asked as studying it curiously.

“Indeed, It combines our powers and amplifies it greatly if we are able to bring out its greatest potential. With the powers of this sword formation, we will be able to unleash a force that will even surpass that of the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom and destroy the Grand Formation by striking at its pressure point.” Jian Wushuang explained.

“I see. Let us hasten then. We must master the skills of using this Sword Formation as fast as we can.” The Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

“Indeed, Time is of the essence.” Jian Nantian nodded sombrely.

Immediately, the four began their rehearsals in the midst of the shrouding darkness.

In this dimension, the four could practice freely without fear of being disturbed.

Knowing that Time was a luxury for them, they trained and rehearsed for night and day without rest.

Time fleeted by swiftly…

With a blink of an eye, so passed a year.

An uneasy peace had endured quietly in the past year between the Jin Kingdom and the Green Fire World.

There had not been any clashes or disputes between both factions, not even the most insignificant conflict.

The only jot of unrest, lied only with the black and white swirling mass of energy that has been ceaselessly spinning thousands of miles away from the Battle Fortress.

One could hardly remember its feebleness when it was first conjured a year ago. But the vortex had outgrown its original size in leaps and bounds in merely twelve months that it was now a gargantuan monstrosity!

Within the fastness of the Oblivion Palace.

“Attack!”

Thunderous cries came from four corners of the Sword Formation in unison as the figures brandished their blades as one.

Four jets of Sword Essences shot into the air.

The four geysers of energies poured with incredible strength, shuddering with terrifying force.

The bolts of energies tore through the air and came down together and bombarded the empty space at the center of the four.

“Boom!”

The fabric of Space at the center tore asunder by the huge force, forming a void that threatened to engulf all mass and matter around it.

Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies, Jian Nantian and the Sunrise Sword Emperor regarded with cold indifference at their handiwork.

“Almost there.” Jian Wushuang could not help a smile of satisfaction.

“The magic of this Sword Formation is really complex that it has taken a year and countless hourless of practice for us to fully grasp the subtle finesse needed to properly operate this formation.” Jian Nantian smiled.

“We can hardly wait no longer. We have expended a years time. Despite not having a perfect mastery of the formation, the formation has been able to produce a peak yield of energy with our current skills. That should be enough.” The Sword Emperor remarked.

“I concur.” Jian Nantian nodded.

“Let us prepare ourselves then. We strike tomorrow!” Jian Wushuang proclaimed.

“Very well.” The Sword Emperor and Jian Nantian both agreed.

The next day, the forces of the Green Fire World assembled at the edges of the Fortress.

Shielded by the magical barriers of the Battle Fortress, they looked over and saw the gargantuan vortex swirling menacingly before them.

The vortex now spanned thousands of kilometers wide like a terrifying and monstrous abomination. Yet despite its size, the black and white spinning vortex was still growing at blinding pace.

“In only a year, it has grown to such horrifying bulk, reaching for thousands of kilometers and yet it still grows. If given another year to grow, I wager it will enlarge into a terrible mammoth in hundreds of millions of kilometers wide!” Palace Master Yun moned gravely.

“Hundreds of millions of kilometers wide?”

The warriors of the Green Fire World were all shocked with the ominous premonition.

It was understandable for even Universe Master need some time to travel across such vast distances.

Yet, the Grand Formation before them would grow into such egregious hugeness in only a year.

“Despite its size, the vortex’s drawing force is still yet to fully mature. Universe Masters are able to withstand its pull. We are hardly affected by its force the Battle Fortress’s protective barriers.”

“But if it were to grow again for another year. The drawing force would increase at least a hundredfold. By then, even a Universe Master will not be able to resist its pull and even be instantly obliterated. This Battle Fortress will also be engulfed by the vortex in ten years.” Palace Master Yun explained with detail.

“We strike now. We must now lose any more time.” Jian Wushuang spoke pensively. “Samsara Temple Master, is the Puppet Fighter ready?”

“It is.” The Samsara Temple Master nodding as he waved his hand and summoned a silvery figure that appeared before him.

It was a Puppet Fighter clad in silver armor, armed with a long, silver spear. The Puppet Fighter bore the appearance of a man of stern demeanor.

His eyes showed no emotions, gleaming with a cold silvery blush.

“Is that the Puppet Fighter that could fight against the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Puppet in silver armor and felt a cold shiver.

This Puppet Fighter was the trump card of the Green Fire World aside from battle formations and the Battle Fortress.

A Puppet Fighter that could best even the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom himself!

“The Flame Deity Puppet? Moreover, one of the level of Silver Armor?” The Gu King’s voice rose with amazement from within Jian Wushuang.

“Do you know what this Puppet, Gu King?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Of course I do.” The Gu King smiled thinly with pride. “The Fire Deity Puppet is well-renowned in the Eternal Chaotic World. It has three different classes: Copper Armor, Silver Armor, and Gold Armor. The Copper Armor counterpart of this Puppet possesses strength equal to that of the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom. Hence, it is likely that this Silver Armor Puppet would be more powerful than the Monarch!”

“But sadly, this Puppet has been damaged. With the Green Fire World lacking Fire Crystals, this Puppet might not be able to relive its former glory.”

“But still, it should be able to hold off the Monarch for some time. That alone, the Puppet is capable of.”

“Of course. As long as it is able to buy us time!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

With the possibility that the Monarch could be lurking nearby, they need someone to hold him off while Jian Wushuang and his comrades conjure the Sword Formation to destroy the Enduring Samsara Formation.

But with no one in the Green Fire World being able to pit evenly against the Monarch, they could only rely on the Fire Deity Puppet.
