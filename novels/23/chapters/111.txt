Chapter 112: End of the Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Ha-ha, watch out.”

Xiao Mang roared and brought his leg crashing down. The huge rock underneath him instantly scattered into pieces. He crossed over the huge rocks at lightning speed like a ghost and showed up in front of Jian Wushuang in a blink of an eye.

Then he quickly unsheathed his saber.

The untouchable astonishing knife essence fiercely gushed out, leaving Jian Wushuang almost breathless. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

And then, swoosh!

A shining stroke covered the bright sky suddenly, slashing toward Jian Wushuang immediately.

The air was cut apart.

The blade flash hadn’t even arrived, yet a lethal wind overwhelmed him.

Jian Wushuang turned solemn as he realized that the essence in that single stroke of Xiao Mang was already at the 10th level of the Dragon Gate.

“Just come on!”

Jian Wushuang shouted, brandishing the Triple-kill Sword from his hand. In a moment the Earth Sword Essence reached its extreme and the 10th move of formless sword wave burst out.

Meanwhile, his power of the Supreme Golden Pill Realm climbed to the peak too.

Bang!

After a tremendous sound, Jian Wushuang felt that his arm was pushed down and his hand was numb. The huge rock under him had cracked because of the impact of the two terrible forces.

“If I battle him head on, I will lose.” Jian Wushuang suddenly became clearly aware of this.

“Haha, as an Initial Completion of the Golden Pill Realm you’re actually weaker than me.” Xiao Mang sneered at him.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

“Despite my Supreme Golden Pill Realm being in defiance of the natural order, which is even stronger than the normal Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm, Xiao Mang is at the level of top Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm and his Force of Spiritual Power is at the peak of Golden Pill Realm. Based on power, he’s stronger than me.

A newly broken through Initial Completion of the Golden Pill Realm, whose power was stronger than the normal Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm. This was already incredible and would frighten many people. Jian Wushuang was well aware of this.

After all, Xiao Mang had reached the peak of Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm, Jian Wushuang needed to reach at least the top Initial Completion of the Golden Pill Realm to compete him with power.

“It’s tough to fight against him directly, but I can defeat him with my swordsmanship and sword essence.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes became colder and he lifted his Long Sword. Turning into a viper suddenly, the sword circumvented Xiao Mang’s saber and weirdly stabbed towards Xiao Mang’s chest.

“Gale Essence Realm?” Xiao Mang felt surprised. His left hand gathered his mighty spiritual power and slapped quickly at the approaching sword shadow. It didn’t entirely stop the attack of Jian Wushuang, but deflected his sword essence.

The sword shadow passed beside Xiao Mang and failed to connect.

“Take my stroke.” Xiao Mang growled, his hand clenched the saber and chopped it down with anger in an unbelievably domineering fashion.

Jian Wushuang used a backhand stroke to withstand it.

Bang!

The huge rock under Jian Wushuang thoroughly scattered into pieces, as if concealed weapons had bombarded the surrounding rock. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was pushed back by this stroke.

Without thinking Jian Wushuang charged forward and there was a raspy sound of wind and the temperature rapidly rose.

Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, sixth move!

Swoosh!

The sharp and rapid sword light cleaved down and seemed to tear the world apart.

“Before it was the Earth Sword Essence, just now it was the Sword Essence of Gale, and now it’s the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. All with deep comprehension?”

Even Xiao Mang couldn’t help being frightened after watching Jian Wushuang use these move including his Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

“I’ve known that the Disciples of Dragon Palace are the eccentric geniuses, but never realized that they’re such geniuses to comprehend three sword essences at the same time and all to this high level?” Xiao Mang was in shock. However, he parried with his saber and easily resisted the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire.

“Any of the three sword essences I’ve comprehended can’t compare with your Gusty Wind Essence Realm, but it’s enough to overcome you if I use them well.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, then just give a try.” Xiao Mang laughed looking amused.

Boom!

The terrifying roar continued and the battle arrived at a key moment.

…

At the same time while Jian Wushuang was fighting with Xiao Mang, the battle for the Black Water Lotus Seeds at the Quiet Moon Lake was approaching the end as well.

The warriors stood on the lake and there were the dead bodies floating all around, at least more than 100.

The blood dyed the Quiet Moon Lake red, which made it look like a scene of Demonic Hell.

Seeing this, most of the surviving Warriors of the Golden Pill Realm were terrified. Their desire for Black Water Lotus Seeds was reduced.

How tragic!

This bloody battle couldn’t be more violent.

The majority of Warriors of the Golden Pill Realm were dead, even two members on the Earth Dragon List were killed.

The two dead warriors on the List turned out to be Ling Mubai and Fire Lion.

Fire Lion was undoubtedly killed by Gu Tao, while, it was Su Rou who killed Ling Mubai!

“This girl…” Gu Tao stood on the lake, looking at the black-robed girl in front of him with fear.

The black-robed girl looked quite young, just about 15 or 16 years old, and her Cultivation of Spiritual Power only reached the Profound Gold Core Realm. But this young girl suddenly erupted with an amazing power, killing Ling Mubai in a flash and grabbing a Blackwater Lotus Seed.

At this moment, the Quiet Moon Lake returned to peace.

The other warriors all escaped as soon as they carried off the Black Water Lotus Seeds, except Gu Tao and Su Rou, who rather stayed behind. Aware that the seeds were held by Gu Tao and Su Rou, none of the Warriors of the Golden Pill Realm around would dare to take any action.

Without doubt Gu Tao’s strength was the best amongst them. The fact that he had killed Fire Lion clearly proved his strength, ranking 39 on the Earth Dragon List. It was only a fantasy to be able to seize the Black Water Lotus Seed from him.

Even if the Warriors of the Golden Pill Realm fought together, Gu Tao could just run away if he was losing.

But Su Rou, although she looked quite weak, had killed Ling Mubai, which is extremely frightening.

Even Gu Tao didn’t dare to fight against Su Rou.

Seven Black Water Lotus Seeds and I only attained two… this girl kept the left one but I can’t look down on her.

Gu Tao shook his head and gave up thoughts of grabbing the Black Water Lotus Seed from Su Rou.

The Warriors of the Golden Pill Realm around didn’t have the courage to start a battle with her, either.

Therefore this severe battle finally came to an end.
