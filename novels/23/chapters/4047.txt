“I am Gui Yun, the guardian of the Principle Sea,” the brown-haired elder said.

“Guardian?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Ruler, every Principle Sea in the universe has a guardian. As for the purpose of this Guardian’s existence, I don’t know. However, it should be related to the top force behind the creation of the Principle Sea,” Devil Flame said softly.

Jian Wushuang understood that the top force in the depths of the universe created the Principle Sea and spread it throughout the universe. It was impossible for the geniuses of the universe to enter it without a purpose.

“If you want to enter the Principle Sea, you must first show whether you have really comprehended a trace of the universe’s principles. After all…seeing is believing,” said the Guardian, Gui Yun.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then waved his hand. A trace of the power of the universe principle instantly condensed in his palm.

Gui Yun’s eyes immediately lit up. “It really is the universe principle. It’s amazing that a second-level Ruler can comprehend a trace of the universe principle. Although the Bone Pupil Star Field is a large starfield and there are many Rulers, only one has really comprehended a trace of the universe principle. Moreover, that one has only comprehended a trace of the universe principle at the fourth-level Ruler level.”

Jian Wushuang listened calmly, but he found it funny.

After all, he had comprehended a trace of universe principle at the level of Principle Ruler, not the second-level Ruler.

“Well, it proves that you have comprehended a trace of universe principle, so you can go to the Principle Sea.” Gui Yun smiled and waved at the endless sea in front of him.

“Splash!” The endless sea rolled crazily, and the power of the formation rose in the sea. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Go,” Gui Yun said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and rushed to the Principle Sea without hesitation.

As soon as he entered the Principle Sea, Jian Wushuang disappeared in front of Leng Rushuang and the others. Apparently, Jian Wushuang had begun the test of the first level of the Principle Sea.

“Devil Flame, you know more about the Principle Sea. How many levels do you think you can pass with your husband’s comprehension of the universe principles?” Leng Rushuang asked.

“Madam, although I used to be an Ultimate Ruler, I haven’t comprehended any of the universe principles. I haven’t really tried the Principle Sea, but I’ve heard that there are 33 levels in the Principle Sea, and each level has a step. Ruler’s comprehension of the universe principles has improved greatly over the years, so it shouldn’t be difficult to pass the first three levels. As for whether I can pass the fourth level, I don’t know,” Devil Flame said.

“Passing the first three levels isn’t difficult?”

When Gui Yun Heard Devil Flame’s words, he started laughing, “You’re underestimating this Principle Sea a little too much. Although the Principle Sea has 33 levels, and indeed every three levels has a step, the gap between each level is still very big. Under normal circumstances, as long as one grasps a trace of the universe principles, they can pass the first level. However, the second level requires a certain level of comprehension toward the universe principles, and the third level requires one to truly step into the threshold of the universe principles.”

“Your Ruler is only a second-level Ruler, so he must have just been exposed to the universe principles. It’s no problem for him to pass the first level, but I’m afraid the second level will be difficult. I think he can only pass the second level.”

“Not necessarily.” Devil Flame glanced at Gui Yun.

Leng Rushuang just smiled faintly.

Gui Yun did not know Jian Wushuang very well.

Moreover, when Jian Wushuang displayed the universal principle, he did only show a trace of the universal principle. This made Gui Yun think that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the universal principle was not high, so he said so.

However, Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame had a certain understanding of Jian Wushuang. They knew that Jian Wushuang had already grasped a trace of the universal principle at the level of Principle Ruler, and because he had mastered the divine will of the Divine Beginning Realm over the years, his progress in the universe principle was even more rapid.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang had entered the threshold of the universe principle a long time ago.

“Eh?” Gui Yun’s expression changed. “He has passed the first level and is heading to the second level.”

Gui Yun was not surprised that Jian Wushuang had passed the first level.

However, not long after Jian Wushuang passed the first level, Gui Yun sensed that Jian Wushuang had passed the second level again.

“He passed the second level?” Gui Yun was surprised.

“My Ruler is much more powerful than I thought.” Devil Flame glanced at Gui Yun and said with a faint smile.

“Maybe, but he shouldn’t be able to pass the third level.” Gui Yun still insisted on his judgment.

The power of the magic formation surged crazily in the Principle Sea. Unfortunately, they could not see Jian Wushuang pass the Principle Sea.

After Jian Wushuang passed the second level, Gui Yun knew that Jian Wushuang had passed the third level.

“He really passed the third level?” Gui Yun was really shocked.

One had to know that the third level required the comprehension of the universe principles to truly cross the threshold. It was extremely difficult to reach this step.

Many Rulers who had just broken through would take an extremely long period of time to truly reach the threshold of the principles of the universe.

For a second-tier Ruler to be able to pass the third level of the Principle Sea meant that he had to be one of the most supreme geniuses in the entire universe.

“Tsk, tsk. This is going to be interesting. A second-tier Ruler who is able to pass the first three levels of the Principle Sea…those two should be very interested, right?” A strange smile appeared on Gui Yun’s face, following that, he took out two command talismans and sent two messages over.

The Bone Pupil Star Field had two first level starfields, the Golden Feather Starfield and the Blue Flame Starfield. The Star Lords of these two first level Starfields were both final level Rulers, and they were both extremely powerful.

As the saying goes, one mountain can not contain two tigers. There were two first level Starfields in a starfield, and they were the only two final Rulers. Naturally, the battles between these two starfields were very intense.

But today, both Golden Feather Star Lord and Green Flame Star Lord received a message from Gui Yun, the protector of the Principle Sea.

“A second-class Ruler is challenging the Principle Sea, and he has already passed the first three levels.”

Upon receiving this message, the two Star Lords were immediately alarmed.

“The third level of the Principle Sea?”

“That is the threshold of the principles of the universe. Many Rulers who have just broken through are only at this level of comprehension of the principles of the universe, right?”

“If such a super genius can become a disciple of my Golden Feather star sector, then why should I be afraid of that disciple of Green Flame?”

Golden Feather Star Lord’s eyes shone with an unprecedented brilliance. The next moment, he rode the universe passageway within Golden Feather star sector and rushed toward the island where Principle Sea was located at the fastest speed possible.
