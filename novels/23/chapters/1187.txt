Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Within the base of the Gold Kingdom, in the palace that was the deepest inside, the red-headed, cold-looking and young Red Snow King had gathered with a few Universe Masters. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Red Snow King, have you recovered from our injury?” asked the Golden Rock King.

“Right,” replied the Red Snow King with a slight nod. His eyes, however, shone brightly. “That Jian Wushuang is indeed vicious!”

Previously, the four Kings of the Gold Kingdom had tried to assassinate Jian Wushuang, and he led them into Chillywind Valley knowing that he would die one way or the other. The Blood Coldwind then erupted, and the Red Snow King managed to escape with his life, but he was seriously injured.

Over the years, he had remained in seclusion as he healed. It was only recently that he had completely recovered from his injuries.

“It just so happens that the arrival of the main body of our army coincides with my recovery,” he said.

He licked his lips, a vicious look flashing across his eyes.

The Universe Masters beside him were also stirred.

They had waited far too long for this day.

“Five million years!”

“I’ve waited on this battlefield for five million years, and now, I’ll finally get to see His Majesty in person!”

“Haha! When he arrives with the main body of our army, they’ll surely be able to wipe out the Green Fire Palace and the entire Green Fire World completely. This huge battlefield will then fall into the hands of our Gold Kingdom!”

“This day has finally come!”

All of the Universe Masters all glowed with excitement and they growled continuously.

They had been wandering in this battlefield for five million years and were extremely aware of how precious this battlefield could be. Unluckily, the presence of the Green Fire Palace severely restricted their movements. As such, they had long wanted to wipe their enemies completely out.

That said, they did not have the capability to do so.

They tried once five million years before and failed.

After that failure, the Gold Kingdom had not given up trying to take over the battlefield. Their monarch had led the main body of their army toward this place exactly five million years ago.

The location of the battlefield was far too unique, and the monarch of the Gold Kingdom expended much effort to lock in on it. He then spent many long years and sacrificed a lot before finally opening a portal to the battlefield with the inside help of the Red Snow King and gang.

If it were not for the unique geography of the battlefield, he would have arrived long ago.

“All these years, I’ve been waiting on this battlefield and laid the foundations for His Majesty to lead our army here. This battle will be very different from the previous hastily planned one. This time, we are adequately prepared and with these foundations along with the arrival of our monarch and more experts, the Green Fire Palace won’t stand a chance.”

“Our Gold Kingdom will definitely win this battle!”

The Red Snow King roared emotionally.

The Universe Masters were also prepared and were waiting for the main body of their army to arrive.

But at this moment…

Boom!

Then came the sound of a terrible explosion.

Instantly afterward, the entire base of the Jin Kingdom began shaking, and the Red Snow King and the other Universe Masters immediately noticed the tremors.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Multiple figures rose into the sky and appeared in the Void above the base.

The Red Snow King stood in their center, his expression turning extremely chilly as he surveyed the scene in front of them.

“How could the surrounding Restrictive Formations be broken?” he asked as his pupils shrank suddenly.

The main body of their army was about to arrive, but at this moment, the Restrictive Formations surrounding their base in the battlefield were broken?

“It’s the Green Fire Palace. They are going all in and want to destroy our foundations in this battlefield,” the Red Snow King was immediately enlightened.

As expected, after the Restrictions were removed, exposing the Jin Kingdom’s base, many figures with strong aura appeared in the Void before them. The figures could be seen charging toward the Red Snow King and the other experts of the Jin Kingdom.

The figures consisted of the Samsara and Void Temple Masters, the Tang and Sunrise Sword Emperors, as well as the five Universe Master-level Puppet Fighters.

Exactly nine enemies at Universe Master-level were charging directly toward the Red Snow King and gang.

“Are you guys staking the survival of your world on this attack? Do you think it’ll be so easy? Stop them!” he roared.

A scarlet long spear appeared in his hand, a terrible aura emanating from it. He was the first from the Jin Kingdom’s camp to move.

The other seven great Universe Masters, including the Golden Rock and Heaven Illusion Kings, followed closely behind.

A huge battle broke out instantly.

The Samsara Temple Master wore a jet black set of armor. It covered his entire body and even his face, except for a slit which allowed him to see. A murderous aura was emanating from it.

He had transformed into an exceptionally fearsome beast, and he even had a jet black tail that was as sharp as a knife.

Black flames covered his body and he clashed with the Red Snow King in an instant.

“Smash him!” the Red Snow King shouted.

His eyes gleamed as he flicked his wrist, the long spear in his hand flying out toward his enemy.

Snowflakes started falling in the Void surrounding them, but they were strangely blood red in color.

The entire district turned bone-chillingly cold.

“Humph!”

The Samsara Temple Master grunted coldly, as his body expanded suddenly. He charged fiercely directly toward the long spear like a fearsome beast with complete disregard for his own safety.

Bam!

The collision caused the Red Snow King’s weapon to bend into a weird shape. The momentum of the Samsara Temple Master only slowed down partially, and he continued to smash into the Red Snow King.

The Red Snow King grunted.

During this time, the Samsara Temple Master had already lifted his palm.

Swish! He clawed with a frightening speed at his opponent, and it easily sliced the Void surrounding them apart.

The Red Snow King shook and his scarlet spear shot out into the Void like a venomous coiled snake, appearing before his opponent’s claw.

Clang!

The weapon collided with the Temple Master’s palm.

“Get lost!” the Samsara Temple Master exclaimed angrily.

His razor sharp black tail swung forth and slashed at the Red Snow King’s face.

The Red Snow King was caught surprised and could try to fend off the blow but placing his long spear before his chest.

Bang!

The Red Snow King trembled and transformed into Flowing Light, shooting backward.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye.

In a short period of time, the Red Snow King, who had charged fiercely toward his opponents earlier on, was already forced to retreat.

Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised as he observed the fight in the shadows.

“As expected, the Red Snow King’s still alive?, and it looks like he has returned to peak strength.

“Even so, he is still obviously much weaker than the Samsara Temple Master!”
