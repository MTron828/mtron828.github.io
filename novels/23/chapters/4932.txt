4933 Ranch of the Exiled (3)

Even if Jian Wushuang could cross realms and fight, more than three Grand Evolution Immortals had fallen at his hands.

However, facing such a vicious Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he was still unable to fight him.

Above Grand Yan Immortal, every Three Revolutions was a complete transformation, from Three Revolutions to Six Revolutions was a huge change.

The giant beast could easily break Jian Wushuang’s Ancestral Skill or even Immortal Style, which made it extremely difficult for him.

If it was not for the fact that Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens had taken most of the damage, Jian Wushuang would not have been able to fight.

The thick and all-pervasive Yan power made him suffer greatly. It gave Jian Wushuang the illusion that the beast in front of him was not a beast but a Great Yan Immortal who had experienced hundreds of battles.

If they continued to fight, he would only be exhausted by the giant beast.

After Jian Wushuang figured out the problem, he used the Wushuang Sword Dao to force him to retreat and then fled quickly!

“You want to leave?”

The giant beast’s eyes narrowed. It was clear that it was also determined to kill. Its nine huge mouths spat out pitch-black pillars of light at the same time.

The nine pillars merged into one and shot up into the sky, directly hitting Jian Wushuang’s back.

Boom!

The unparalleled power exploded. He had no way to dodge and had completely taken the blow!

At this moment, the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens burst out with the most magnificent blue color and protected Jian Wushuang’s Immortal body.

But even so, the vast Yan power still knocked him out in an instant, and he fell headfirst into the sea that was as thick as ink.

“I seem to have used too much strength…”

The giant beast shook its head and said. Then, it looked at the figure that had fallen into the sea and pounced over.

When his Immortal body entered the water, an unimaginable coldness invaded his body and he fainted.

The giant beast flew over and was about to open its mouth to swallow Jian Wushuang. However, dark chains as thick as arms stretched out from the sea and quickly wrapped around Jian Wushuang’s limbs, dragging him away.

Seeing these chains, the giant beast seemed to be facing a great enemy. Fear flashed in its eyes.

However, this fear only lasted for a moment. Then, it opened its huge mouth and bit at Jian Wushuang, who had fainted.

However, the chains were so fast that the beast missed.

The chain wrapped around Jian Wushuang and he went directly to the bottom of the sea. Soon, he disappeared without a trace.

The giant beast roared in anger, but in the end, there was nothing it could do.

…

The coldness, deathly stillness, and all kinds of unpredictable negative effects invaded Jian Wushuang’s Immortal body.

He barely had some consciousness, but he could not use a trace of Yan power. He could only let the chains drag him into the endless abyss.

He forced his eyes open and soon fainted again.

Clank…

The sound of the iron chains rubbing against the rocks was so loud that it made one’s teeth ache. It was mixed with the whistling sound of the water and echoed in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

He only felt the seawater slapping against his back. Beneath him was solid land.

After an unknown period of time, Jian Wushuang finally woke up when there was a flow of Yan power in his meridians.

He used his hands to prop up his immortal body that was about to fall apart and barely sat on the ground.

At this moment, he realized that he was on solid land.

“So there’s actually and in this Endless Sea area.”

He was a little surprised, but he quickly regained his composure.

Under the last attack of the giant beast, even though Jian Wushuang had the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens, he still received the most serious injury.

Even though his Immortal body was not broken, his meridians were almost broken. It was difficult for him to even circulate his Yan power.

Beneath him was a grayish-white land, and there were no abnormal fluctuations.

Jian Wushuang seized every second to sit up.

In this strange Endless Sea, he had to maintain his peak condition in order to leave this place alive.

It was only at this moment that Jian Wushuang realized that the one who was swallowed by the giant beast was not Di Qing.

That figure seemed to have used some kind of secret technique to change his face into Di Qing’s appearance to confuse him.

Moreover, the way the figure acted also confirmed Jian Wushuang’s thoughts.

Di Qing was so proud that he could even remain calm in front of Zhen Wuyang. How could he lose his composure in such a situation?

At the same time, it was impossible for him to be swallowed by the giant beast without any struggle.

After thinking it through, Jian Wushuang swallowed another Emperor-grade pill and recovered with all his might.

With the nourishment of the pills, the recovery speed of the Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body was extremely fast. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In less than half a day, Jian Wushuang had recovered more than 90 percent.

He slowly opened his eyes, and divine patterns flowed around his body. Then, he lowered his head to look at the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens that was emitting a faint blue light.

“What material is this thing made of? It’s actually so heaven-defying?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens that could block a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal’s full-force attack did not even leave a mark, it might really be able to block an Emperor’s full-force attack.

Jian Wushuang collected his thoughts and began to size up the continent.

Rather than calling this place a continent, it would be more appropriate to call it an isolated island.

The grayish-white rocks under their feet were full of potholes, and there was not a single weed growing. It was extremely desolate and lonely.

After pondering for a moment, Jian Wushuang walked into the depths of the isolated island.

“Hehehe, another reckless fellow has come.”

An ethereal voice suddenly sounded in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

He was shocked and looked directly at a protruding boulder beside him.

Then, a short old man in a thick fur coat walked out from behind the boulder.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed as he saw the thick chain around the elder’s neck.

“That kid, you were also exiled here?” The elder in thick fur coat sized up Jian Wushuang as if he was looking at a treasure.

Even though he was trying to hold it in, Jian Wushuang could still tell that something was wrong with him.

“Yes, I was exiled here,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

The old man nodded. “Then do you know where this is?”

“Where am I?”

A strange smile appeared on his face, revealing his blood-red gums. “Then let me tell you that this is a fallen paradise. Every guy who comes here only has two paths.”

“Be killed or survive!”

“This is a free-for-all, Ranch of the Exiled!”

The old man slowly raised his arms and said with a strange smile.

As his voice fell, a terrifying energy belonging to a Grand Yan Immortal spread out.

“Even though you’re just a puny little Yan Immortal, to me, it’s enough,” the old man said greedily.

In the next moment, he dashed toward Jian Wushuang and slapped down with his palm.
