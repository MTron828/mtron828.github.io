“You’re acting mysterious!”

Lord Zhennan’s face turned ugly as he coldly snorted and shouted, “Divine Sun Wheel, break for this king!!!”

Whoosh!

The two sun-like Divine Wheels behind him suddenly shot up like two balls of fire and smashed into the darkness!

!!

However, this Divine Sun Wheel, which was usually majestic, was like a tiny spark that fell into the vast ocean. It did not even cause a wave before it was gradually extinguished.

An invisible force deprived the divine sun wheel of its power. Then, under Lord Zhennan’s furious gaze, the two Divine Wheels, which were top grade Supreme treasures of laws, began to decline in grade.

High grade…middle-grade…low-grade…

In just a few seconds, the two Divine Wheels turned from high-grade nomological supreme treasures to dull ordinary weapons. in the end, they broke down and turned into nothingness.

“This!”

The Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince looked at each other, their eyes filled with disbelief!

They had never heard of such a strange power that could make a nomological Supreme treasure fall into an ordinary weapon without a sound!

Before they could think further, what happened next made them cry out in horror!

The surging divine power in their bodies disappeared at an extremely fast speed!

It was as if a pair of invisible hands were taking away everything from them!

“No!”

The Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince’s expressions changed drastically, and they no longer dared to hide their trump cards.

“Forbidden technique, Blood Sun!”

Great bestowment secret technique, Emperor’s seal!

A huge scarlet fireball, like the sun, exuded a terrifyingly hot aura as it rose up from the void.

In the void, a huge throne that could suppress the starry sky appeared. On the huge throne, there was a blurry figure wearing a nine-clawed golden dragon king robe and a dragon crown on his head. His face could not be seen clearly, and he was extremely majestic.

This was the Prince of the South and the Third Prince’s strongest trump card!

However, it was all useless.

In this absolute darkness, all light would be lost.

The blood-red sun only lasted for less than ten breaths before its flames were extinguished. It turned into the purest divine power energy and was devoured by the darkness.

The tall and majestic emperor’s figure was even more vulnerable. After the darkness attached itself to it, it silently crumbled and disappeared.

Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince’s divine power gradually dried up. Their tall and burly bodies quickly shriveled up as if their flesh and blood had been sucked dry.

From the outside, one would see a huge black ball in the sky. The black sword qi, which was as black as ink, interwove together like a big net and wrapped Jian Wushuang, Lord Zhennan, and the Third Prince in it.

…

Time passed slowly. On the Ninth Kalpa King’s side, as the Third Prince and Lord Zhennan were lured away by Jian Wushuang, the pressure on the Ninth Kalpa King suddenly disappeared. Not only did he not show any signs of being suppressed, but he was also like a world-destroying mad dragon. After activating his innate divine ability ‘Demon God evolution’, his battle strength increased tenfold. He struck out his palms like a storm and suppressed the nine blood underworld messengers and the Ruler Silver Roc with his own power.

“Lord Zhennan, the Third Prince, and the divine armor guards, what the hell are they doing?!” The Ruler Silver Roc’s face turned extremely pale. He had expected that they would be responsible for holding back the Ninth Kalpa King. After the divine armor guards had finished dealing with the forces under the Ninth Kalpa King, they would turn around and kill him together!

But now, there was no news from the divine armor guards, the Third Prince, who was fighting against Jian Wushuang, and Lord Zhennan, who had gone to help the Third Prince.

The Ruler Silver Roc’s eyes flickered. He looked at Lord Zhennan, the Third Prince, and Jian Wushuang as he fought against the Ninth Kalpa King with the nine blood messengers.

In the void, Lord Zhennan, the Third Prince, and Jian Wushuang had all disappeared. What was left was a huge round black ball.

The three of them were inside the black ball, but there was no aura coming from them.

“The situation has changed. I might have to leave first again…” The Ruler Silver Roc’s thoughts raced. He had always been a cautious person. Otherwise, he would not have been the only one in his clan who had escaped from the Ninth Kalpa King.

The situation in front of him had completely deviated from his expected trajectory, so he had a hint of retreat in his heart.

As for the Ninth Kalpa King, he was also paying attention to Jian Wushuang’s movements. He turned his head to look at the huge black ball that was like a spider web where Jian Wushuang was. He could not help but raise his eyebrows.

“This…could this be a divine Kingdom of one thought?” The Ninth Kalpa King muttered to himself in confusion.

Others might not be able to see anything, but as someone who was half a step into the Supreme-being realm, he could naturally see that Jian Wushuang’s black ball had clearly created a world that belonged to Jian Wushuang.

“That’s not right. Although it’s similar to One Thought Divine Kingdom, it’s not One Thought Divine Kingdom. The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head. As the one who comprehended the One Thought Divine Kingdom, he naturally had a deep understanding of it. The One Thought Divine Kingdom was an independent world with heaven, earth, mountains, rivers, and mountains. however, Jian Wushuang’s black ball space was filled with cold, dead, and lifeless aura.”

This aura made even him feel a little apprehensive.

“In a short thousand years, this guy has grown to this extent.” The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head, and a smile appeared on his face, “I…how can we let him win?”

The next moment!

“One Thought Divine Kingdom!”

“Rise!”

“Rumble!”

All of a sudden, heaven and earth lost their color. An unprecedented powerful aura suddenly exploded with the Ninth Kalpa King as the center!

This aura was completely different from the aura of the Ninth Kalpa King. It was filled with a feeling of the mysterious great dao. The void in the Tarot Ruins seemed to be unable to withstand this aura, and it made a ‘ka ka’ sound similar to glass breaking!

Immediately, the surrounding space of the trial arena began to change.

With the Ninth Kalpa King as the center, a huge and magnificent power directly extended out.

This power was enough to suffocate any resident and make them tremble in fear!

This…this is the One Thought Divine Kingdom that only Supreme martial artists can comprehend?!

“Not good! Quickly run!”

Ruler Silver Roc’s face instantly fell.

At this moment, even the emissaries, who had been expressionless the whole time, were shocked. they said in a deep voice, “Ninth Kalpa King, let us go, and Blood Sky Palace will not look for you again. We will not pursue the past anymore.”

They could already see that it was absolutely impossible to take down the Ninth Kalpa King today, unless the Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince could kill Jian Wushuang to help.
