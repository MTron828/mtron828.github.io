Chapter 5462 ¬†Out of Seclusion

Jian Wushuang closed himself off for tens of millions of years, a duration that held no sense of passing for him in his current state.

His divine body was growing.

His avatars, on the other hand, delved into the comprehension of the Sword Dao and the Extreme Dao. The avatar on the Heavenly Chessboard was constantly imitating the various Origin Source Daos that could be possessed.

Soon, billions of years passed in the blink of an eye.

During this time, Gong Miaoyi went out a few times, visiting the Elder Palace to exchange for treasures needed for cultivation.

Her gains in the Western Sea were substantial, possessing top-quality Eternal Treasures. She also exchanged for some special Origin treasures from the Elder Palace. Her strength progressed rapidly, almost keeping pace with an Inheritor. Although she was a peak-level tier 5 Emperor, she could contend with a tier 6.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang's cultivation of the Origin Source was progressing slowly. After billions of years, he finally expanded the Extreme Dao to the eight level. However, reaching the ninth level or even achieving perfection in the ninth level required the Spatial Origin Source to reach the level of a black hole.

Currently, he only had 70 percent of the power of a black hole, still lacking quite a bit.

Fortunately, the Sword Dao provided him with a clear direction.

The embryonic form of the Ultimate Sword Dao's ninth level was a Formless Sword. By comprehending the Origin Source within the Jueyun Sword, he reached the eight level.

Jueyun suppresses evil!

The Formless Sword was entirely oriented towards slaughter, annihilating everything.

He was getting close to the ninth level.

Merely relying on seclusion was no longer sufficient to meet his current needs.

Moreover, his divine body had reached 49,000-fold, and when he wielded the Beast God Weapon, it easily reached 50,000-fold.

His current combat power was not weaker than an ordinary tier 6 Emperor.

It was time to go out and explore the various treasures of the Elder Palace.

In a slow exhale, Jian Wushuang rose from his position, stretched his body, and leaped into a spring within the grand hall.

The spring had the ability to quickly pull one's consciousness out of immersion. Jian Wushuang soaked for about the time it takes an incense stick to burn, then emerged.

Changing into a soft black robe, he noticed Gong Miaoyi still in cultivation. Her subordinates had set up a barrier around her, so as not to disturb her, he silently left alone.

Exiting the cave, an endless expanse of emerald green lakes stretched before him. The intense sunlight bathed everything in its glow.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang erupted from his spot and headed towards the southern islands.

His first destination was the Demon Sound Mountain. He wanted to revisit this old place, uncertain if the Demon-Sealing Space was still intact.

Back then, he had cultivated there for tens of thousands of years. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Now, the mountain remained, but the familiar faces were gone.

Along the way, Jian Wushuang encountered numerous Emperors, mostly youthful faces, likely the later Inheritors.

As he expected, over the years, inheritors had sprouted like mushrooms throughout the Elder Palace.

He had some understanding of the Inheritors on Grave God Mountain. Although he hadn't been there, he had heard a lot.

On Grave God Mountain, after becoming an Emperor, there were also different ranks. Ordinary Emperors, like Emperor Si Tian, would generally leave the mountain to undertake missions in the Four Great Secret Realms.

Extraordinary ones, like Hu Qing and the Ultimate Light Dao Lord, were exempt from such requirements. They could freely cultivate on Grave God Mountain after becoming Emperors.

Most of those who had recently broken through to become Emperors were second-rank Origin Source Dao experts.

Many special Origin Sources or Dao Lords of the Ultimate Dao had yet to mature, still a long way from breaking through to Emperor.

After all, not everyone had accumulated to the peak before entering the Qishen Temple.

For individuals like Jiu Yu and Wan Xing, who were already Dao Lord powerhouses before entering the Qishen Temple, with the temple's substantial cultivation, they quickly achieved Dao Merge and became Emperors.

Swish!

Outside the Demon Sound Mountain.

Jian Wushuang was a million miles away from the Demon Sound Mountain.

From a distance, he could see the Demon Sound Mountain shrouded in clouds, emanating the former demonic sound and vast Origin Source aura.

That Origin Source came from the Universe Master.

Moreover, the Universe Master who left behind the Origin Source in this place was no ordinary being.

Currently, there were many Emperors cultivating on the Demon Sound Mountain, easily tens of thousands.

Among them, in addition to the elders from the Elders Palace, there were also Inheritors and core members recruited from the Heavenly Realm by the Elders Palace. The weakest among them were at the peak-level tier 4.

Jian Wushuang took a step, directly arriving at the Demon Sound Mountain.

At the foot of the mountain, there were special guardians from the Elders Palace. It wasn't easy to enter the Demon Sound Mountain for cultivation; it required a significant contribution or godstones.

Although the price was high, having money didn't guarantee entry from the outside.

Inheritors generally paid with godstones, while the Elders Palace's strong individuals exchanged contributions for a rare opportunity.

"To enter the Demon Sound Mountain, you need to pay 100 million godstones!" The old guardian sat on the throne, expressionless, exuding unparalleled majesty.

Several tier 4 Emperors in front of Jian Wushuang hesitated.

"Senior Brother, we're still lacking 50 million godstones!" spoke a peak-level tier 4 Emperor.

This group of people, except for the leader, were all tier 5 Emperors. Even though they came from prestigious backgrounds, it wasn't easy for them to come up with 100 million godstones.

In the standard of the Earth Realm, the Heavenly Realm remained influential.

A tier 4 Emperor in the Heavenly Realm often had a net worth ranging from several million to tens of millions of divine stones. Accumulating over a billion divine stones was a formidable task unless one had a tremendous stroke of luck or possessed treasures bestowed by sects or clans that could be used as collateral.

The amount of godstones one could present wasn't as crucial as their intrinsic value.

Some tier 5 Emperors found themselves penniless at times, but the treasures on their bodies and the profound martial arts they inherited held substantial value, easily exchanging for millions or even billions of divine stones.

The leader of a group of tier 5 Emperors faced such a predicament. Hailing from the frigid northern regions, they were all distinguished individuals with powerful backgrounds. However, they were currently stumped by the requirement of 50 million godstones.

"Esteemed Senior, may I offer this divine sword as collateral?" The leading tier 5 Emperor felt a bit embarrassed. 50 million godstones weren't much to him, but due to financial constraints, he could only produce a valuable item as collateral.

The elderly man seated on the throne furrowed his brow, showing little surprise. He couldn't help but hold some disdain for this tier 5 Emperor, thinking him rather destitute for offering a mere broken sword as collateral.

In the background, Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow and stepped forward, finding the broken sword increasingly familiar.

"Wait a moment!" he approached, casually taking out 100 million godstones, and declared, "I'll take this sword. Here's 100 million divine stones!"

The tier 5 Emperor recognized Jian Wushuang's extraordinary aura and promptly expressed gratitude, "Many thanks, Your Highness!"

The elderly man on the throne was somewhat surprised. A broken sword was bought for 100 million godstones. While unusual, he didn't pay it much mind. Over the years, there had been many Inheritors, and he had grown accustomed to their ways. According to the internal information of the Elder Palace, they knew these Inheritors came from outer universes, inexperienced and naturally endowed with Origin Sources, surpassing the Four Great Secret Realms. Despite being stronger individually, they were rare in number. In the outer realms, there wasn't even a single tier 6 Emperor among them, a fact that often drew ridicule.
