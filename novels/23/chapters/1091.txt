Chapter 1092: Sudden Changes!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Time flew. Before he knew it, an entire year had passed.

The Soul-luring Incense inside the hall, massive as it was, was beginning to reach its end.

The moment the incense was extinguished, the special fragrance that filled the hall vanished in an instant. The door was once again unlocked.

Jian Wushuang, who was seated cross-legged, opened his eyes and rose to his feet.

He wore a smile on his face as he made a small wave with his hand.

Out of the blue, a sword light appeared.

The dazzling sword light flew forward, moving so miserably slow that it seemed any Dao Master could easily dodge it by using a body technique.

However, never mind a Dao Master, even a Celestial Master would be forced to confront the light with all his might without being able to dodge it. That was how fast the sword light was.

“The real Speed Sword Principle is the combination of both ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ motions.”

“The swordsmanship that my father manifested when he killed Celestial Master Lei Yi with a single strike might share a similar Dao with my Speed Sword Principle.”

He smiled even wider after watching his sword light disappear into the Void.

He had finally made a breakthrough in his Sword Principles after meditating for a year under the guidance of the Soul-luring Incense. Now he had a second Sword Principle of the Creation Level under his belt.

It was based on the Aurora Sword Principle and included two conceptions of fast and slow motions. It was called the Speed Sword Principle.

With the completion of the Speed Sword Principle, Jian Wushuang now had two Sword Principles of the Creation Level. Naturally, his strength also skyrocketed.

“What a pity that the incense burns only for a year. If it lasts for another two or three months, I could finish the Yin-Yang Sword Principle.”?Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

In the past year, he had perfected the Speed Sword Principle as well as created the Scarlet Yin Sword Principle, which now coexisted with the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle. Both were close to a perfect combination. Once that happened, he would be able to create the Yin-Yang Sword Principle of the Creation Level. Then, he would have a total of three Sword Principles of the Creation Level.

“It’s just a matter of time before that happens now that I’ve found a way. It doesn’t matter even if I don’t have the Soul-luring Incense anymore.”?Jian Wushuang was delighted.

He had benefited a lot in the past year.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Celestial Master Yu Ding’s gentle voice drifted in as he walked into the hall.

He came up to Jian Wushuang and asked, “How are things?”

“Not bad,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“I’m sure you’ve gained a lot after cultivating a year under the guidance of the Soul-luring Incense,” Yu Ding said with a sigh. “Since the rules of Green Fire Palace stipulate that we’re only eligible for a Soul-leading Incense each, there’s no reason for you to stay in Tai Qing Palace anymore. Let’s return to Green Fire Palace.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He was content with all that he had gained in the past year.

He set off for the wormhole with Yu Ding at once and traveled using the same path as they had come in.

Just as they walked out of the hall and were still in the corridor of the palace… “Boom!”

There was a loud explosion accompanied by a strong aura of Spiritual Power.

“Hm?” Yu Ding’s expression immediately changed.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Both of them sensed that the explosion and the aura of Spiritual Power originating from outside of the palace. It was not far from them.

“Is someone fighting outside?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Tai Qing Palace was located on the huge battlefield. Experts from both Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom could be found on the battlefield all year round, searching for opportunities.

Considering their intense hatred for each other, it was normal for experts of both sides to fight when they met on the battlefield.

“Come with me.”

With a serious expression, Yu Ding quickened his pace and brought Jian Wushuang to the gate of the palace right away.

They hovered above the hall as they looked at the source of the explosion.

Soon, several figures appeared in their vision.

Hundreds ofthousands of miles away, three golden-armored men besieged a silver-haired old lady equipped with a long stick. The old lady was bleeding all over and her aura was weakened as well. She was obviously severely injured.

The golden-armored men emanated strong auras. Two of them were medium Celestial Masters while the other was an advanced Celestial Master.

The old lady was merely a medium Celestial Master.

It would be strenuous for the injured old lady to cope with even one of them, but there was now three of them.

“Oh no! It’s Celestial Master Silver Moon!”

Yu Ding’s expression darkened when he saw who it was.

“Celestial Master Silver Moon? Is she one of us?” Jian Wushuang looked serious.

“Yes.” Yu Ding nodded solemnly. “She has been adventuring on the battlefield. She’s quite good at fending for herself and hasn’t encountered major troubles for millions of years. But she’s now facing grave danger!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“So what are we waiting for? Let’s hurry and help her!” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice. His Blood Mountain Sword was already in hand as he was about to rush out.

However, just as he moved, a transparent layer of Restriction appeared in front of him.

“What?” His expression changed.

“It’s useless. Tai Qing Palace is quite unique. Though Temple Master Void has already tamed it, he can’t take it away so it has been left here on the battlefield. He keeps the Restriction of Tai Qing Palace activated to prevent Jin Kingdom experts from breaking in. But that also means we can’t get out of it,” Yu Ding muttered.

“There’s no way out?” Jian Wushuang looked displeased. “So are we just going to sit here and watch?”

“I’ve reported this to Temple Master Void. He’ll turn off the Restriction as soon as he hears of it and we can rescue her then. But it’ll take two breaths,” Yu Ding said in a cold voice, with a tint of killing intent on his face.

Two breaths were merely the span of several seconds. This process was already very efficient.

However, the passing of two breaths was more than enough time for Celestial Masters to launch a series of attacks. Could Celestial Master Silver Moon hold on during this time?
