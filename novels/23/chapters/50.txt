Chapter 51: The First Interspatial Ring

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Tianhuan Sect.

“Chi!”

A long spear stabbed through the throat of a Tianhuan Sect disciple without making a sound. Then, with an abrupt sweep, it heavily hacked towards two more disciples, making them step back.

“If you don’t want to be killed, then leave.”

Yin Min, a nifty girl with a long spear in her hands, wore a cold expression while criticizing them. However, several Tianhuan Sect disciples ignored her words and lunged at her, immediately attacking with their knives and swords.

“Kill them,” Yin Min said in a cold voice.

A flash of coldness appeared in the eyes of Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao, but suddenly…

“Hum!”

A cold voice and three auras rushed into the battle. These cultivators were stronger than previous Tianhuan Sect disciples.

“Three people at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea?”

The arrival of these three caused Jian Wushuang’s expression to change.

Since they came to the Tianhuan Sect, they had encountered three groups of Tianhuan Sect disciples who just reached the level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and the Initial Realm. They had yet to encounter a single disciple at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, not to mention encountering three of them at the same time.

“You two, protect yourselves,” Yin Min said in a low voice. Then, the long spear in her hands danced through the air like flashing stars and drifting snow as it struck towards two of the disciples at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.

“Haozi (Mouse), leave the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciple to me. As for the others, it’s up to you to handle them,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Yes,” Ling Tianhao said and nodded.

Although he had to fight against several Tianhuan Sect disciples at the same time, these disciples were only at the level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm or Initial Spiritual Sea Realm and were no threat to him. Those three at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, that could threaten him, had been blocked by Yin Min and Jian Wushuang.

“How dare you two guys blocked me?”

Yin Min laughed loudly and then she furiously hacked towards the two people at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm with the long red spear, blasting them with hazy spear shadows. Both of them realized how ruthless and tyrannical Yin Min was as they fended her off with all their strength. However, they were no match for Yin Min’s spear skills.

Though fighting against two enemies, Yin Min still gained the upper hand.

“Be careful, she is strong,” said a person at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, seriously.

“Hum, she is only at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. Why should we be afraid of her when we have a two-to-one advantage? Let’s kill her.” The other one sniffed and then they lunged at Yin Min again.

A giant axe was shown in front of Yin Min and hacked towards her.

Meanwhile, a flash of dark gold sword light appeared in front of Yin Min, traveling ten meters in an instant.

“How ridiculous.” Yin Min laughed as the look in her eyes abruptly turned cold.

“Divine Spear of Dripping Blood!”

Clang!Clang!Clang!

Two flashes of spear shadow struck out successively, faster than those two people expected. And then, those two flashes of spear shadow stabbed into the area between the eyebrows of both disciples, immediately killing them.

“Good girl, Yin Min has a good command of her spearmanship.”

Jian Wushuang was still fighting with the other disciple at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. But he saw everything that happened, especially when Yin Min killed other two disciples at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on her own.

“It seems that I should also show a little bit of my ability.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while looking at his enemy.

“Die!”

Only Jian Wushuang could hear his light voice. The disciple at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm saw a flash of cold sword light in front of him, rapidly approaching his eyes.

It was too fast for him to resist, quickly piercing through his throat.

Meanwhile, Ling Tianhao also defeated his enemies.

“Swordsman, not bad. How did you kill someone at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on your own?” Yin Min asked while looking at Jian Wushuang with startled eyes.

“Haha. I just have a good luck,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Really?” Yin Min raised her eyebrow but didn’t continue asking.

“Go and see if any of them have an Interspatial Ring,” said Yin Min.

It only took a moment for Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao to check them.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Nothing here either.” Ling Tianhao also shook his head.

“It seems that we really have bad luck. We have killed so many Tianhuan Sect’s disciples, even three people at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm but we still didn’t find an Interspatial Ring,” Yin Min said with a wry smile.

Peng!

Suddenly, a wall on the perimeter of the courtyard shattered as a pitiful figure heavily landed on the ground. It was a white-hair old man, who vomited a mouthful of blood after falling on the ground. Then, he stood up and immediately tried to escape.

“Where are you trying to escape to?”

Four figures appeared behind the white-hair old man, chasing after him.

Jian Wushuang had seen these four people receive the Golden-dragon Guard task together with him.

Jian Wushuang’s group of three felt surprised when they saw these four people chasing the white-hair old man who wore a lilac ring on his right ring finger.

“That’s an Interspatial Ring!”

“He has an Interspatial Ring!”

“Let’s do it!”

Without any hesitation, all three rushed in front of the white-hair old man, among whom Yin Min arrived first. She ruthlessly struck out with the long spear as if trying to pierce through everything in the world.

“What?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The white-hair old man had already encountered a major battle that left him seriously injured, but now he was being chased by four people. He was already in a desperate situation and he didn’t expect to encounter even more people from the Golden-dragon Palace. The white-hair old man felt hopeless when he saw the ruthless spear stabbing towards him.

“Chi!”

The spear stabbed through the white-hair old man. Then the spear cut off his right ring finger and made it fly up. Yin Min reached out to grasp the amputated finger and the lilac ring on it as it fell directly into her hand.

“The first Interspatial Ring!”

Seeing this, both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao smiled.

However, on the other side, the expressions of the four people who had chased the white-hair old man before suddenly turned dark.

“Hand over the ring!”

“That Interspatial Ring belongs to us.”

“Don’t speak nonsense, kill her immediately!”

Boom!

Four figures tried to kill Yin Min at the same time.

“Sh*t.”

The complexions of both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao changed. Although they had known that they might need to kill people from their own side during the task, they didn’t expect these people to attack without any hesitation.
