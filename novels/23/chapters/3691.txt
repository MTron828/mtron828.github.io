Chapter 3693: Giant Green Hand

This cold shout contained an unquestionable will that exploded in the world.

At the moment the voice sounded, the world suddenly shook.

From the void at the highest point, a giant dark green hand suddenly extended out and grabbed toward the Black Divine Spear.

The attack of this huge green hand caused the pupils of everyone present to shrink.

No matter who it was, they could feel that supreme power from this huge green hand.

That power did not originate from the cultivators, but from the Heavenly Dao!

“The power of the Heavenly Dao’s will!”

“The will of the Heavenly Dao has descended?”

“That’s not right, the will of the Heavenly Dao is only a will. The power of the Heavenly Dao that can be mobilized is extremely limited. At most, it can threaten some masters of laws. However, why does this huge hand formed by the will of the Heavenly Dao feel so powerful?”

Looking at the giant green hand that suddenly appeared, many people present were terrified, including some Principles Masters who were extremely powerful.

The power contained in the giant green hand was indeed too powerful.

At least, it was much stronger than the Principles Masters. Unsurprisingly, the power contained in the giant hand had reached the Ruler Realm.

However, when could the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Divine Beginning Realm mobilize the power of the will of the Ruler Realm?

Unless...boom!

The earth began to shake violently. Jian Wushuang could vaguely feel that the moment the giant green hand extended out, the void of the Divine Beginning Realm also had some influence.

“It seems that he’s desperate.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He knew that under normal circumstances, in order to maintain the normal operation and evolution of the Divine Beginning Realm, the divine will could not use too much power. At most, it would be like before, he chose three Principles Masters who were not weak as his spokespersons. Then, because of the blessing of the heavenly will, these three people could burst out with power far stronger than that of the Principles Masters.

These were the Three Saint Realm Masters.

But this was only under normal circumstances.

But now, it was obviously not under normal circumstances.

The Three Saint Realm Masters were dead, and the Black Spear was about to fall into Jian Wushuang’s hands. How could Devil Cloud Star Master not be anxious? Thus, Devil Cloud Star Master recklessly mobilized the power of the heavenly will of the Divine Beginning Realm, that was why the giant green hand had descended.

Although the giant green hand had descended, it had a huge impact on the Divine Beginning Realm at that moment. The price for it was also very high for Devil Cloud Star Master.

“Do you think you can get the spear back just like that?”

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. Just as the giant green hand was about to grab the black spear, he moved and took a step forward.

When he took a step forward, a shocking power burst out from his body.

He used his life divine power and heaven-cleaving skill at the same time.

At the same time, because he had refined the Eternal Chaotic World, he was favored by the universal laws, which gave him a lot of benefits.

Among them, there was an extremely powerful will power.

Jian Wushuang had not used this will power since he got it.

But now...buzz!

The power of the will was directly integrated into Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

“The most powerful skill, Starfire Burning Sun!”

Jian Wushuang attacked with all his strength. A sword light containing explosive power suddenly swept out.

The sword light was so huge that it covered half of the world. It immediately went to meet the giant green hand.

The sound of a blade passing through a person’s divine body rang out. The giant green hand was cut in half by the sword light.

The giant hand was cut in half, and a large amount of majestic power of the Heavenly Dao spread out in all directions.

“The power of the universe principles? How is this possible?!”

An unbelievable voice echoed in the deepest part of the Heaven and Earth.

Devil Cloud Star Master knew very well that the power of the will of Heavenly Dao that he mobilized at all costs was extremely powerful. Even though Jian Wushuang was strong enough now, he was confident that he could still resist or even suppress him, but in the end, his giant hand formed by the power of Heavenly Dao was cut open?

The power contained in that sword and the special power contained in it completely shocked Devil Cloud Star Master.

He knew that the power had already surpassed that of most advanced Rulers.

The extremely special but supreme power contained in the sword was even the power of the universe principles!

Even if Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship only contained a trace of the universe principles, it could still make his swordsmanship extremely terrifying.

“It seems that the arrival of the universe principles really gave you a lot of good things.” The mighty voice sounded again.

Jian Wushuang sneered.

But at this moment…

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank because he had noticed that at the same time when he used his swordsmanship to cut the giant green hand into two, a strange figure had appeared beside the black spear, he put the black spear into his interspatial ring.

After doing all this, the figure did not leave immediately. Instead, she stood there and looked at him calmly.

“This person...”

Jian Wushuang looked at the person.

She was an extremely beautiful woman. Her temperament was cold and without any emotion. She looked at him with a strange smile in her eyes. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“It’s you, Ruler Star Luo!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice turned cold. He had already recognized her.

In his previous life, he had interacted with Ruler Star Luo in the Eternal Chaotic World, so he knew her appearance very well.

The person in front of him was obviously Ruler Star Luo. She looked exactly the same and her aura was exactly the same.

The only difference was that Ruler Star Luo had only sent a consciousness clone to the Eternal Chaotic World, but now it was her original body.

She also possessed the strength of a real Ruler.

“Jian Wushuang...I really didn’t expect that you could reach such a level in such a short time. Not only the three masters of the Saint Realm in the Divine Beginning Realm, but even the three masters from the Devil Cloud Star died at your hands?” Ruler Star Luo stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Since you know that the three masters of the Saint Realm and the three Rulers from the Devil Cloud Star have died at my hands, how dare you show up in front of me?

“You even dare to steal my things. You have guts.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, you underestimate me. Although we are both Rulers, I’m not as useless as that trash. In the Divine Beginning Realm, I can’t do anything to you, but if I want to leave, you can’t stop me.”

With that, Ruler Star Luo disappeared in front of Jian Wushuang.
