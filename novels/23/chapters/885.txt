Chapter 886: The Number One King, Zi Dong!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Xuefeng, come fight me!”

Chaos broke out immediately with Zi Dong’s challenge among the whole Drill Ground.

“Challenge?”

“Is Zi Dong challenging Xuefeng?”

“Haha, Zi Dong finally found an opponent!”

“We haven’t seen Zi Dong fight in so long! The last time he fought, he hadn’t even passed Level Two!”

“Zi Dong and Xuefeng? Who will win this fight?”

One by one, the gazes of the crowd all brightened up.

Jian Wushuang also noticed the burning passion in Zi Dong’s eyes. He laughed and nodded, “I also want to know how strong the number one King of Star Island is.”

Jian Wushuang had really high expectations.

He would never turn down this fight.

It was always lonely being on top of everyone else.

Now, the two strongest people in the Eternal Realm of Star Island were him and Zi Dong. Naturally, they would have to treat each other as honorable opponents.

“Make a move, I hope that you won’t disappoint me.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang take up the fight, the corners of Zi Dong’s mouth went up.

“I will try my best.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Following which, he took out his 36 Blood-sky Swords and they instantly formed a two-feet long scarlet long sword.

A black thunderbolt traveled from Jian Wushuang’s body into the sword formation once again.

“Oh, Divine Yin Thunder?”

Zi Dong took notice of Jian Wushuang’s move. When he saw him using the Divine Yin Thunder, his eyes lit up. He laughed, “Haha, what a coincidence! That’s what I’m cultivating too!”

“You too?” Jian Wushuang was flustered. “Then let’s see whose is stronger!”

After speaking, Jian Wushuang controlled his scarlet longsword such that it shot out like an explosion.

It was as fast as lightning, the crowd was unable to see it flash past the Void.

On the other hand, the longsword’s target, Zi Dong, laughed coldly. When the sword was approaching him, he suddenly moved his body.

Whoosh! A purple shadow flashed past the Void.

It was as quick as a ghost.

Jian Wushuang’s longsword had fixed its target. It was already so close to touching Zi Dong, but he moved away so quickly.

In that instant, he literally moved past the edges of the sword.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was greatly taken aback.

The first launch of his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was the Traceless Sword Formation. Its strength was its fast speed, followed by its also remarkable power.

With the support of the Divine Yin Thunder, the sword formation’s shooting rate became even faster. Usually, it was difficult for even the Eternal Realm to capture the Shadow of the longsword. However, Zi Dong actually managed to just pass arond it.

Dodge the sword formation?

What kind of a speed was that?

“Xuefeng, take this spear!”

After going around the sword formation, Zi Dong appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. The two long spears on his back had already formed together. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a grin and threw the spears in his hands.

It all happened as fast as lightning.

Jian Wushuang had already turned into the Gold-armored Ancient God state. However, the armor was too big. He was unable to avoid Zi Dong’s attack. He could only take out his Blood Mountain Sword and perform swordsmanship as he launched it against his opponent.

Clang!

Once the tip of the long spear landed on the blood-colored Blood Mountain Sword, it caused a strong spiral effect. The force seemed like it was going to grind Jian Wushuang’s hand. Luckily, the physical strength of Jian Wushuang’s Gold-armored Ancient God was incredibly strong. With the addition of his Xue Ying armor, he was well-protected.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly. He dismissed the spiral force easily, although he was forced to take a few steps back while doing so.

While he was back-tracking, Jian Wushuang’s gaze was full of glistening flashes of light. He controlled his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation and immediately launched an attack back to Zi Dong.

“Your sword formation may be quick and your power may be strong enough, but it’s such a pity that you’re obviously not too familiarised with using it yet. Your actions are clumsy and not flexible. Against me, a sword formation like this is basically useless.” Zi Dong smiled lightly and just stood where he was, allowing the scarlet long sword to aim directly for him.

Right before the long sword was about to hit him, Zi Dong suddenly moved his body and bypassed it once again.

“Again?” Jian Wushuang’s face was sullen.

The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation that he was controlling was super fast. It had met many opponents before and none of them had managed to surpass it. Zi Dong was the only one.

“Not flexible enough?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his eyebrows and sighed to himself.

After all, he had just gotten control of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation recently, which was the reason he was at the Initial Realm of understanding towards the first attack of this skill. This led to the flaws in his activation of the skill.

Jian Wushuang was on the Drill Ground, focusing on controlling the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. He shot them at Zi Dong at a crazy speed, but the target just stood there and moved his body just when strictly required. He managed to avoid 10 consecutive attacks easily. Jian Wushuang’s swings did not even touch the corners of Zi Dong’s sleeves.

“I’ve already said, your sword formation has no effects on me at all!”

Once again, he avoided the sword formation’s attack. Zi Dong shooked his head and snorted, and then his body flashed past violently.

He was too quick for the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation that Jian Wushuang was controlling. It proved that he was too inflexible.

The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was actually capable of being speedy and powerful, but Jian Wushuang only knew how to control it to launch an attack straight forward. The formation’s speed would slow down if it was to turn or change direction in the Void.

“Fail!”

Zi Dong laughed faintly and launched the long sword he was holding onto again.

This attack was faster and scarier than the previous one.

The dangerous attack made the part of the Void in front of him blow up violently.

Although Jian Wushuang’s sword formation tried its best to protect him, his arm was still numb from the shock and fresh blood was dripping from the corners of his mouth. Afterward, Zi Dong’s spear skills went completely insane.

One by one, the spear shadows flew towards Jian Wushuang. They were strangely fast and traveled at unexpected angles, which suffocated Jian Wushuang.

He set up an all-body protection and managed to withstand a few spear attacks. However, the projectiles soon pierced through the protection.

Jian Wushuang had lost the fight.

Jian Wushuang’s body had recovered completely as he laid on the Drill Ground. The two-feet long scarlet longsword was floating silently beside him.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation beside him and shook his head in shame.

“I relied on the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation the most. If Zi Dong had not dodged its attacks, I could have battled with him. But in the end, my sword formation was nothing to him.”

“Without the sword formation, once he comes near me, I would be left with limited ways to attack back.”

“I fail with dignity in this duel.”
