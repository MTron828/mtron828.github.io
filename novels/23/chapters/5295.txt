Chapter 5294 - 5294: Imprison

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This sword strike!

Descending from the heavens, it transformed into a spherical cage, enveloping the entire world.

This sword strike was called ‘Imprison’.

A single sword strike could confine the heavens and also annihilate everything.

This is the ultimate seventh level of the Ultimate Sword Dao!

Jian Wushuang felt a profound sense of clarity throughout his being.

A breakthrough from all directions made him almost disbelieve what was happening.

Here was the immense power of the universe’s origin source.

Although just a tiny strand, it brought him immeasurable benefits.

It could even be said as endless.

Within the Extreme origin source, there appeared a colorful origin source, continuously spreading and gradually harmonizing with the Extreme origin source.

This breakthrough was not merely in swordsmanship; it was primarily due to that scene.

What truly benefited him immensely was the Extreme origin source.

The Extreme origin source was already lagging behind, and now it seemed he could digest it slowly, and continuous breakthroughs were not a problem.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in the depths of space, dedicating himself to cultivation.

Physical trials were long forgotten.

Now, the crucial thing was to digest this tremendous opportunity.

Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, mastering the spatial origin source, the seventh level of the Ultimate Dao.

The former was the origin only Emperor-level experts could grasp, while the latter had just met the standard of merging Daos.

His current strength was too unbalanced; his strengths were too strong, and his weaknesses were too weak.

Qishen Temple!

Inside the sea of the universe.

At this moment, Zhen Ling was worrying about the news brought by Xuan One. He had just appeared and now needed to withdraw again; this was not what he wanted.

But if he didn’t leave, he wouldn’t be able to withstand that great calamity, the same calamity that even the Qishen Temple couldn’t bear back in the day. What could he use to confront it?

Heh heh…

Zhen Ling, with eyes resembling emerald- green beans, blinked a few times before swiftly scanning the celestial curtains. Amongst the numerous curtains, he spotted Jian Wushuang and his face darkened.

Especially upon seeing the multicolored cosmic origin source on Jian Wushuangs body, his anger surged, almost making him stomp his feet and curse in fury.

n zhu Yi!”

Zhen Ling roared in anger.

Although Zhu Yi was the foundation of the Original Realm, he was the one controlling the entire Qishen Temple. A strand of cosmic origin source was incredibly precious, yet it was devoured by a Grand Yan Immortal.

If it were someone else, he might not have minded much, especially if the little monk he had his eyes on had absorbed it. But now, this ability to devour was possessed by Jian Wushuang, a mere youngster, which was a direct challenge to his authority.

His roar shook the entire Sea of Origin Source. Compared to the origin sources here, that strand of cosmic origin source was like a bowl of water in the vast ocean.

Whoosh!

Zhu Yi tore through space and instantly arrived at the Sea of Origin Source.

With her clear and cold eyes, she observed Zhen Lings fierce and sinister demeanor, furrowing her brow.

“My Lord! ”

Zhu Yi stood tall, exuding an air of confidence and valor.

Zhen Ling, perched in the pavilion, saw Zhu Yi’s composed demeanor. Just as he was about to explode in anger, he had a change of heart.

He had just weakened the authority of the Four Great Temples; stirring up trouble with Zhu Yi over the universe origin source at this moment might lead to unforeseen consequences.

His expression softened slightly, and Zhen Ling cleared his throat, saying lightly, “Temple Master Zhu Yi, it seems that something has changed in the Original Realm. It appears that something is missing, don’t you think?”

The words of Zhen Ling were eloquent. If it weren’t for the establishment of the Elder Palace this time, he would have scolded Zhu Yi severely.

Now, the Qishen Temple faced relocation, and everything had to be done cautiously.

After all, the core of the Qishen Temple was still the Four Temples.

Although he had a say, these puppets were not simple-minded. If they decided to establish their own faction, he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. He could only suppress them. In the end, he would be the one to suffer losses.

The Black Tortoise Temple had gradually distanced itself from the Qishen Temple. Its main camp was in the Outer Hall, ready to detach at any time, So, he dared not offend Xuan One. He had to deal with these people slowly, without haste.

“Somethings missing?”

Zhu Yi e s face darkened. The intricate thoughts of Seven Orifices LinglongAlll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Heart immediately struck her. She instantly figured out what was happening.

However, her thoughts didn’t align perfectly with those of Zhen Ling.

He cursed inwardly, regretting sending Zhu Qi to Demon Sound Mountain. There must be a problem on Demon Sound Mountain.

Zhu Qi still had a connection with Shan Jun. But now, she couldn’t afford to reveal any flaws in front of Zhen Ling. She could only feign composure.

“l don’t know, please enlighten me, my lord!”

Zhen Ling raised an eyebrow. If there was a problem in his territory and he had to clarify it, someone would be punished!

However, a sudden inspiration struck him, and he came up with a solution.

“It’s my negligence. The Original Realm is undergoing a trial, and you, as a busy person, might have forgotten. There’s a problem on Demon Sound

Mountain.”

Zhen Ling sighed, then continued, “It’s my fault. There are too many things in the Original Realm, including some miscellaneous items that need to be moved to the Four Great Secret Realms. Fortunately, those places have been cleared out. I think we should move Demon Sound Mountain there!”

“Move it there?”

Zhu Yi cursed silently. Wasn’t this just a blatant robbery?

“My lord, I don’t think it’s necessary. Moving Demon Sound Mountain, a small mountain, might cause some inconvenience,” Zhu Yi tried to advise.

Zhen Ling waved his hand, smiling faintly. “l think we should move it. If we don’t, certain individuals might consider it their private property and give it away.”

He was right. Shan Jun had given the essence from the Universe Bronze Furnace to Jian Wushuang this time. Next time, he might even give away the entire Universe Bronze Furnace.

That was unacceptable.

Zhen Ling waved his hand, and a bubble enveloped Zhu Yi. The two of them left side by side.

“Zhu Yi, if I recall correctly, it was you who placed Shan Jun on Demon Sound Mountain, right?” Zhen Ling asked casually.

He hadn’t fully awakened back then, but he knew some things.

Shan Jun was suppressed by Vermilion Phoenix Temple, and Zhu Yi threw him into the Demon Sound Mountain.

Officially, it was suppression, but in reality, Shan Jun was quite free on the mountaintop.

His clone could roam freely on the mountain, and due to Zhu Qi’s influence, Shan Jun also managed the backyard of the Demon Sound Mountain, the Demon- Sealing Space.

According to the normal procedure, Demon Lords who hadn’t surrendered would be thrown into prison. But Shan Jun hadn’t surrendered and didn’t stay in the Third Prison for long before being released.

The reason given back then was even more absurd – they claimed they were afraid Shan Jun would perish in the Third Prison, so they suppressed him in the Demon Sound Mountain. This reason was simply outrageous.

A top tier 6 Demon Lord, and they were afraid he would perish in the Third Prison. Were they suggesting he should enjoy a comfortable life in the Fourth Prison?

Now that they had a hold on him, they had to send him to prison without fail.

If the Third Prison didn’t work, then the Second Prison it would be.

Let him experience what a real prison was, what true purgatory meant.

The Third Prison housed tier 6 Emperors.

The Second Prison was where tier 6 Emperors were sent to die.

Moreover, there was no historical record of imprisoning Demon Lords below tier 6 in the Second Prison. Some criminals, like those who mistakenly fought tier 5 Emperors, were generally sent to the Fourth Prison.

Those who wanted to kill those tier 5 Emperors would be sent to the Third

Prison. Back in the day, the old man with goat horns was almost sent to the

Third Prison due to someone’s plot, but fortunately, Shan Jun helped him, saving his life..
