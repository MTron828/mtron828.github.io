“It failed.”Looking at the perfectly running formation, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World fell silent.

Jian Wushuang also knitted his eyebrows and did not want to believe what he was seeing.

Right then…

“Jian Wushuang!”A loud yell came from the surrounding space. It was Demon King Chen Yu, who had managed to break free from the soul attack and appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

Demon King Chen Yu’s eyes were burning with anger as he roared at Jian Wushuang. “Brat, if it weren’t for the restrictions this heaven and earth has on my soul power, do you think your soul attack could affect me?”

He was one of the remaining experts from the Ancient Past.

His realm was far above the Chaotic Realm. However, due to the restrictions the heaven and earth had, his power had been restricted to that of an ordinary peak great emperor.

The restrictions this heaven and earth had was not just on power. It also had restrictions on the soul power and holy body.

This was why Emperor Bai could hurt him and Jian Wushuang could affect him with his soul attack.

If he had been at his prime, Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang could not have done any harm to him even if he just stood there.

Demon King Chen Yu stared at Jian Wushuang angrily, while the latter did not even bother to look at him.

Jian Wushuang was still staring at the Opposing Blood Formation.

“Even the attack from Emperor Bai himself could not affect this Opposing Blood Formation. The only way possible to destroy this formation was to allow Emperor Bai to attack this formation with full force without any distractions.”

“However, Emperor Bai was preoccupied by Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen. He cannot focus on the formation.”

“If I use that move, I might be able to destroy the formation. But that move…” Jian Wushuang thought grimly.

He had several trump cards. One of the trump cards was the Secret Skills of Star Palace.

He had managed to cultivate the third scroll of Secret Skills of Star Palace. He could make his attacks a thousand times stronger.

With his current power level, he could destroy the formation if he used the Secret Skills of Star Palace and Emperor Sword Principle as this would enable his attacks to be even more powerful than those of Emperor Bai.

However… he had just used Secret Skills of Star Palace not too long ago!

He had used the secret skill back at the Imperial City within the Three Emperors World. That was about a hundred years ago.

It was not easy to cast Secret Skills of Star Palace, especially the third scroll. He needed a thousand years before he could cast the same secret skill again.

WIthin the short hundred years, he had yet to recover much star power, hence was unable to use this secret skill.

Hence, this was not a possibility anymore.

On the other side of the battlefield, Emperor Bai, Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen stopped fighting.

Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen were not in good condition. On the other hand, Emperor Bai was still ready to go.

“Jian Wushuang? This brat really has many trump cards. He has already displayed many techniques and skills. I never thought he would still have the soul attack trick up his sleeve. Even Demon King Chen Yu could not fend it off in a short amount of time.” Kaiser Blood turned and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Luckily, the Opposing Blood Formation absorbed so much blood qi from the experts that it became very sturdy. He does not possess the ability and power to destroy the formation. He almost ruined my plan.”

Emperor Bai looked dark.

He kept everything Jian Wushuang did in mind.

Jian Wushuang had done everything almost perfectly: he had cast soul attack at the right time and created a chance for him to attack the Opposing Blood Formation.

However, when he saw that the attack from the emperor token he had created causing no damage to the formation, his heart sank.

“Kaiser Blood, what are you trying to do?” Emperor Bai yelled.

“Do you want to know? Very well, I shall let you see.”

“The formation is about ready. Time to start.” Kaiser Blood laughed coldly.

“It’s starting?” Lord Leng and Demon King Chen Yu looked excited.

“Haha. Opposing Blood Formation, start!” Kaiser Blood laughed as his voice reverberated through the battlefield.

Under his guidance, the formation started to rise and float towards the sky above.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank as he felt even more uncertain of what was about to happen. Sadly, he could not do anything about it.

There was no way he could stop the Opposing Blood Formation.

Even Emperor Bai was helpless in this situation.

Emperor Bai had already attacked, but Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen stopped him together.

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were all weak and had almost no fighting power in them.

All they could do was watch the Opposing Blood Formation rise up into the sky.

Finally, the Opposing Blood Formation reached the top of the sky. Within moments, it fused with the sky.

“This formation fused with heaven and earth?” The experts were all confused.

Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows tightly.

When he used his Mountain River Map, it was too fused with heaven and earth.

However, this formation was completely different from the Mountain River Map.

After this Opposing Blood Formation fused into the heaven and earth, it completely disappeared, only leaving a small, blood-red vortex in the middle of the sky.

Just when everyone was confused…

From the small vortex, a surging blood-red light swept out in all directions.

This blood-red light was like an endless river as it spread out in all directions.

WIthin moments, the entire sky of the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds was completely covered, but the spreading did not stop.

This was not the end. In fact, this was just the beginning.

The blood-red river did not face any obstructions as it spread to all the territories and regions outside of the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Ground.

Three Emperors World, twelve states, eighty four god mansion and three thousand three hundred territories. How far and wide could it spread?

As the river spread, every single territory, region and state was covered by it.

Within moments, this river filled every corner of the Three Emperors World.

The entire Three Emperors World turned blood-red!
