Chapter 2548: Ye Clan Leader

Ye Dingshan’s face sank as his divine power breath erupted and made his move.

Rumbling... The sky shook as the overwhelming divine power came down on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly. Ye Dingshan was a genuine Peak Ultimate God after all unlike the others, hence his capabilities and powers should not be taken lightly.

Jian Wushuang decided to use the Seven Stars Secret Technique. Infinite golden divine power converged behind Jian Wushuang and formed a Golden God Shadow in the blink of an eye.

It was majestic, huge, and towered over everything.

As Jian Wushuang dived down from the void, his terrifying divine power which erupted shook the earth revealing strengths no weaker than Ye Dingshan.

“Holy moly, he’s just a High-Level Ultimate God, but his powers are no less than that of an average Peak Ultimate God.” The Ye Clan members were impressed.

The two figures were dueling in the void above.

Boom!

There was a loud noise as space and time seemed to have momentarily shied away.

Jian Wushuang’s figure dispersed into eleven apparitions.

“Space-time Apparitions?” Ye Dingshan grinned as he also made the same move.

Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum!

He made thirteen apparitions—two more apparitions than Jian Wushuang.

“He’s also good with Space-time Law and is even better than me.” Jian Wushuang was surprised but a gush of Samsara Strength started sweeping through his body.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with hatred.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

The feeling of hatred came wave after wave!

A hazy sword-light carved a Hateful Path Toward Heaven in the void.

“Humph!”

Ye Dingshan scoffed and suddenly flung out his right hand which had condensed endless divine powers.

Pop! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A clear explosive sound rang.

There were visible cracks in the void like glass about to break apart.

His divine powers had covered up Jian Wushuang’s Hateful Path Toward Heaven.

Ye Dingshan did not stop and had both hands out.

Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

An incessant crisp explosive noise echoed in the void.

Every explosion was accompanied by extremely terrifying strong powers aimed at Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang swung his long sword and swept across multiple times with his sword intent, but were parried off by those terrifying powers.

Jian Wushuang’s face sank and abruptly took a step back.

“That’s enough.” Jian Wushuang gave an enigmatic smile and immediately sent out a palm strike.

Rumbling... The boundless golden divine power ocean instantly erupted.

The golden divine power ocean covered everything and had completely enveloped the void where Ye Dingshan was within a short time, forming an indestructible Golden Prison.

The Golden Prison had trapped both Jian Wushuang and Ye Dingshan within it while Ye Clan’s experts along with everyone else were excluded.

Everyone in the Ye Clan was startled to see the Golden Prison’s emergence.

“Oh no! The Clan Leader is trapped within the prison.”

“This prison is so strong and sturdy, I’m afraid that even a Peak Ultimate God is unable to break out of it.”

“Damn it! It’s impermeable. There’s no way for me to use soul powers. I don’t even know what’s happening inside. Will the Clan Leader be in danger?”

“Don’t worry too much. The Clan Leader is a Peak Ultimate God after all. Jian Yi is still not his match even with this prison in place.”

The Ye Clan members had confidence in their leader, Ye Dingshan.

Jian Wushuang was only a High-Level Ultimate God after all. Perhaps the Clan Leader was unable to threaten Jian Yi, but it was also absolutely impossible for Jian Yi to defeat or kill the Clan Leader.

The Ye Clan members along with those many experts from the surrounding area who had been alerted of the incident waited quietly outside the Golden Prison.

Their wait only lasted for a brief moment.

Boom!

A thunderous roar sounded as the Golden Prison opened up and receded.

Two figures appeared at the opposite ends of the void after the Golden Prison melted away. They were none other than Jian Wushuang and Ye Dingshan.

“A Peak Ultimate God’s strength is indeed powerful. I apologize for my arrogance.” Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter reverberated between Heaven and Earth.

The Ye Clan members and those many cultivators in the surrounding void immediately knew what that meant.

Jian Yi was probably disadvantaged or suffered a small defeat. Otherwise, why would he admit being arrogant?

He must have known he was no match for Ye Dingshan.

The Ye Clan members were overjoyed.

“The Clan Leader is great!”

“Nonsense, Jian Yi is merely a High-Level Ultimate God. How could he be compared with the Clan Leader.”

“He’s smart to have acknowledged he was being arrogant.”

The Ye Clan’s experts commented.

They did not notice Ye Dingshan looked extremely solemn and took a deep look toward Jian Wushuang for some time before saying, “The Ye Clan had indeed offended you and it’s normal for one’s master to seek justice for his disciple, but one hundred thousand Primordial Stones are too much. What about fifty thousand Primordial Stones?”

“Fifty thousand Primordial Stone?” The Ye Clan’s members were shocked.

Most people did not understand why Ye Dingshan had taken out fifty thousand Primordial Stones as compensation despite winning.

Only a few people along with the purple-haired old man knew that he was just waiting.

“Haha, I’m just here to seek justice for my disciple and don’t intend to make Ye Clan my enemy. The Primordial Stones are a small matter. If you don’t mind, we can go to some other place and talk,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Yes, please come into the Ye Clan mansion, Mr. Jian Yi,” said Ye Dingshan.

“I won’t be courteous.”

Jian Wushuang grinned and went towards the Ye Clan’s Mansion with Ye Dingshan’s guidance.

Everyone present was at a loss.

They wondered what had happened. Why were the two opponents so polite to each other?

The Clan Leader Leader was an arrogant man and yet he invited Jian Yi into the Ye Clan’s Mansion.

Jian Wushuang came out of the mansion half an hour later.

“You can stop escorting me here. I’m leaving.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Safe journeys, Mr. Jian Yi. Do come by and visit us if you have the time. Our Ye Clan members will treat you well.” Ye Dingshan was being rather humbled and gentle

.

“Haha, sure.” Jian Wushuang cupped up his hands as everyone in the Ye Clan watched him depart and soon disappeared out of sight.
