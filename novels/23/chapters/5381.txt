Chapter 5380 - 5380: Ancestral Temple

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, in the end, they were all Emperors. Patriarch Xia Mang had set down a rule that only Imperial Emperors could enter the clan’s memorial tablets.

Earth immortals could be recorded in the ancestral temple family records.

This was the reason why the Xia Mang clan had persisted until now and produced countless powerful individuals.

If one couldn’t become an Emperor, they would die without the honor of meeting their Patriachs in the afterlife.

At the very least, after they died, their descendants could still burn incense for them in the ancestral temple.

After this group of people paid their respects, hundreds more, including family elders, came following them.

Within the imperial city’s ancestral clans, there were 100,000 clan members, surpassing the number of Yan Immortals by a full 10,000.

This extended the ceremony well into the night.

Outside the ancestral temple was a small river.

On the other side of the river lay an ancient village, the place where the Patriach had lived.

Inside the village, paths crisscrossed in a chaotic manner.

After traversing the village, they arrived at a small courtyard halfway up the mountain, where everyone stopped.

“The 74th generation eldest son, Xia Mang Yunxing, pays respects to the Patriach!”

Xia Mang Yunxing led the way in kneeling and bowing.

Only the old eunuch remained standing, quietly observing everything.

The surroundings made Jian Wushuang curious.

The ancestral founder of Great Xia, who had established the chaotic ancient country and was once a prince in the mortal world, why would he live here?

After the ceremony, as Jian Wushuang looked back from this vantage point towards the ancestral temple, the view was remarkably broad.

Looking at the ancestral temple from this position, the view was very wide.

Above the ancestral temple, there was a small mountain, positioned halfway up with a fenced courtyard.

Certainly, this place held extraordinary significance for Patriarch Xia Mang.

Whether it was due to the acquisition or some childhood emotional experiences!

The local customs here were evidently mundane, different from the environment within the Great Xia Empire. It was estimated that Patriarch Xia Mang had traveled to other countries during his wanderings in the southern regions.

Although it was said to be a visit, they didn’t actually meet face-to-face.

Xia Mang Yunsu turned around, preparing to leave with the others. At this moment, the old eunuch said a few words to Xia Mang Yunxing. No one could hear them, only seeing his lips slightly moving.

After listening to the old eunuch’s words, Xia Mang Yunxing first showed confusion, then a hint of shock!

Finally, he turned to Xia Mang Guanyu, his gaze gentle.

“Yu’er, Patriach said he wants to see you, and he holds you in high regard. You must seize this opportunity; he is the Patriach of our Xia Mang clan!” Xia Mang Yunsu attached great importance to this meeting and gave many instructions.

Jian Wushuang was stunned for a moment, suddenly thinking of something. But since he was addressed as a junior, how could he refuse? He quickly transmitted his voice, “Imperial Father, rest assured, I know what to do!”

Watching these people leave.

Jian Wushuang revealed a look of despair.

He must have been exposed!

When Xia Mang Yunxing transmitted his voice, Bai Junwang had already informed Jian Wushuang that the tier 6 Emperor had communicated with him. asking them to gather for a discussion indoors.

“Don’t be afraid. I’ve already informed Xia Mang of your identity; he won’t dare to do anything!” Bai Junwang was surprisingly calm.

If they were to really make a move, Jian Wushuang would be finished, and Bai Junwang would be in trouble as well.

He had already passed this matter on to the divine spirit.

The transcendent elder who presided over Tiannan would personally come!

It wasn’t very far from here; the location of the Great Xia Empire in Tiannan was considered central.

It would take about an hour to arrive; the teleportation arrays established by the Kui Organization spread throughout half the region, designed for convenient escape.

This was the first time it had saved someone.

Without this unwritten rule, in the face of mortal danger, one’s own abilities wouldn’t suffice, and no one would come to help.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, this time was different. Bai Junwang was the lifeblood of the divine spirit. The entire plan for the future depended on Bai Junwang restoring his peak strength; he couldn’t afford to fall now.

Moreover, Jian Wushuangs life was quite valuable too; it couldn’t be easily given up.

A Grand Xia Patriarch, a top tier 6 Emperor, didn’t qualify as a strong opponent. However, if it were the head of the Nalan family, that would be a different story.

After all, he was a peak expert, and the other party might not necessarily give face.

It wasn’t realistic to mobilize more forces either. If the people from the White Tiger Temple were wiped out, the losses would be substantial.

Jian Wushuangs palms were sweaty. He could only steel himself and walk in.

Trying to calm his own breath, his appearance changed.

In front of such strong individuals, continuing to conceal his true face would be disrespectful.

After the change in appearance, his aura also surged. The powerful force of All Things surged up, surpassing the might of a tier 3 Emperor and reaching the power of a tier 4 Emperor.

Letting the other party understand how strong he was.

A Dao Lord like him, who defied the heavens, was not someone that could be casually killed.

In the previous encounter, Long Yi had been quite polite to Hu Qing in front of so many people. Over these days, many strong individuals had personally gone to pay their respects to Hu Qing.

The royal family was also desperately trying to win him over, and the Crown Prince’s status was rising.

Wuliangs identity was exposed, but Long Yi’s attitude towards him was average, and because of his arrogant personality, even if someone went to visit, he wouldn’t meet them.

Hu Qing treated everyone equally.

“I am Junior Jian Wushuang, I’m here to greet Senior Xia Mang!” Jian Wushuang was extremely respectful, not even daring to mention Grave God Mountain, fearing that the other party would be unhappy.

Mentioning Grave God Mountain would be asserting dominance.

If there was a Yan Immortal who killed his descendants and acted arrogantly before him, no matter how influential the background, they had to be taught a lesson.

A long and cold voice sounded, shaking Jian Wushuang repeatedly backward.

His chest felt heavy, a mouthful of scalding hot blood just reached his mouth, only to be swallowed back.

He tightly clenched his fists, enduring the invasion of subsequent breaths.

His face instantly turned deathly pale, devoid of any trace of color.

“Come in!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang dared to move slowly, intending to transmit a message to Bai Junwang within, but was interrupted.

Inside him, on the fragment of the origin source, Bai Junwang hastily waved his hand, interrupting Jian Wushuang.

Since they could detect Bai Junwang within him, they couldn’t be underestimated.

Transmitting sound at such close range might be noticed by Xia Mang.

However, sending a message to the divine spirit by Bai Junwang was extremely discreet; even peak experts might not detect it.

After passing through the golden fence and the small courtyard, Xia Mang, dressed in simple attire, emerged from the thatched house like an old farmer, trembling as he walked.

Jian Wushuang dared not look directly and bowed again.

Xia Mang walked slowly, his voice hoarse and low, “Do you know the arrangement here?”

Jian Wushuang slowly straightened up, silently shaking his head.

Although he searched through some memories of Xia Mang Guanyu, his understanding of the Great Xia was not thorough. After all, he was just a prince. If the Emperor had probed his soul, he might have known more.

“This is the home I established when founding the Great Xia!” Xia Niang’s voice became calm, and there was a hint of reminiscence in his eyes. His home at that time was indeed not the magnificent palace of an ordinary dynasty.

Jian Wushuang felt helpless; he disliked it when powerful beings reminisced in front of him.

Then, in the midst of reminiscence, they subtly conveyed some of their actions to him.

Not a bit enjoyable.

Xia Mang walked to the stone table, sat down alone, poured himself a cup of tea, and then turned his head to glare at Jian Wushuang angrily. “Family is the only obsession after obtaining the Dao.. Killing my descendants, infiltrating the Great Xia internally, your crime deserves death!”
