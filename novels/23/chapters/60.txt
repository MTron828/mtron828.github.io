“Gold-Dragon Ambassador, what do you think about this little guy?” Huo Man asked.

“His comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale is good.” Ye Rufeng smiled slightly and looked at Jian Wushuang, then continued, “Little guy, how old are you?”

“17,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Only 17?” Ye Rufeng and Huo Man both had a surprised expression, then Ye Rufeng laughed and said, “You are excellent considering your high comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale. Little guy, you should prepare yourself to go to the Dragon Palace with me in two days.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up because he understood that Ye Rufeng recognized his talent and was going to recommend him.

“Thank you so much, Gold-Dragon Ambassador,” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

“You are welcome. It will also benefit me if you really become a disciple of Dragon Palace.” Ye Rufeng gave a wave.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then he left.

Qingdong City, Celestial Immortal Residence.

“Brother Swordsman.”

“Swordsman, how did it go?”

Yin Min and Ling Tianhao had been waiting for him since earlier.

“The Gold-Dragon Ambassador promised to recommend me. But it’s not guaranteed that I can join Dragon Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, based on your strength, you should definitely be able to. Come on. Cheers,” Ling Tianhao said and smiled.

Jian Wushuang grabbed the wine cup and had a toast with Ling Tianhao.

Although the time that he had been acquainted with Yin Min and Ling Tianhao was not long, he found that they were a spontaneous and merited group after getting along with them.

“The status of a Gold-Dragon Ambassador is high and he knows a lot regarding Dragon Palace. Also, a Gold-Dragon Ambassador has a limited number of recommendations, so each recommendation is important. Since the Gold-Dragon Ambassador recommended you, it means that he thinks you have the ability to make it through the test to join Dragon Palace,” Yin Min said.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Indeed, Ye Rufeng was well informed on the situation inside the Dragon Palace. Since he was willing to recommend him, it meant that he was confident in Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, based on that, you will definitely be able to join and cultivate in the Dragon Palace. Come on. Cheers! Cheers! Congratulations!” Ling Tianhao said instantly.

Jian Wushuang and Yin Min also lift their cups. The three of them were drinking with passion.

Two days later, at the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

“Little guy, are you ready? Let’s go,” Ye Rufeng said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then he left the city with Ye Rufeng. Now, they were outside of the city.

“Grasp my hand,” Ye Rufeng said.

After grasping Ye Rufeng’s hand without hesitance, Jian Wushuang felt a special power gathering beneath Ye Rufeng’s feet. Subsequently, the figure of Ye Rufeng was floating and then Jian Wushuang also began floating.

Then… Hoom!

They left at an incredible speed.

“Is this Voidwalk?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and became even more eager to reach the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

The distance between the Dragon Palace and Qingdong City was equal to the most remote provinces. It would take one or two months to rush to the Dragon Palace if Jian Wushuang walked there on his own. But now it would only take one day to rush to the Dragon Palace under Ye Rufeng’s lead. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Is this the Dragon Palace?”

Jian Wushuang was still floating in the air, overlooking the boundless ground in astonishment. Below him, he saw an area between two giant mountains, full of magnificent palaces and pavilions that towered above the ground.

In the center, a statue of a gold dragon was coiled up, appearing as if it was flying to the Ninth Heaven.

“Let’s go down.”

Ye Rufeng dived down along with Jian Wushuang. Upon reaching the ground, many figures appeared in front of them.

These people all wore the same golden armors and helmets, holding golden long spears. When they saw Ye Rufeng, they paid their respects instantly and said, “Your Excellency!”

“Where are the two Palace Masters?” Ye Rufeng asked directly.

“They are both staying at the Dragon Gate,” A Golden-armored Sergeant, a leader among them, said,

“Oh. The Dragon Gate? Is there an exceptional genius going through the Dragon Gate Pass? He should be fascinating if he drew the attention of the two Palace Masters!” replied Ye Rufeng.

“Yes. He is new, but his talent is unbelievable. It’s said that he has made it through the sixth layer,” said the Golden-armored Sergeant.

“What? The sixth layer?” Ye Rufeng was shocked and then waved his hand, saying, “Carry on with your duties. I’ll go meet the two Palace Masters on my own.”

“Okay.” Those Golden-armored Sergeants went back to work immediately. However, they could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang as they left.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was serious. Once those Golden-armored Sergeants were gone, he could not help asking, “Your Excellency, those Sergeants are all experts in the Gold Core Realm?”

“Yes. And their strength is at the peak of the Gold Core Realm.” Ye Rufeng smiled casually and continued saying, “those Golden-armored Sergeants are the Emperor-guarding Army that is well known in the Tianzong Dynasty. They specifically guard the imperial palace and some other important areas. They are the most elite and violent force in the Tianzong Dynasty. The battle strength of the army is astonishing. The minimum strength required to become a Sergeant in the Emperor-guarding Army the Peak of the Golden Core Realm!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

The minimum strength required for normal Sergeants was the peak of the Gold Core Realm?

“Little guy, I have heard from Huo Man that you have a great enmity with the Blood Feather Tower, and that it’s irreconcilable. Is that right?” Ye Rufeng asked while looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded.

“Don’t worry about the Blood Feather Tower. As long as you can make it through the Dragon Palace’s test and become a disciple of Dragon Palace, you will be protected. The Dragon Palace is located at the campsite of the Emperor-guarding Army. There are many experts. The Blood Feather Tower has no way to kill you in the Dragon Palace, even if they sent all of their experts here,” said Ye Rufeng.

Jian Wushuang believed him.

“Your Excellency. Is the Dragon Gate that the Sergeant mentioned also the testing area for joining the Dragon Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You are clever. Yes, a carp jumping into the Dragon Gate means that you are successful. Every disciple who joins and cultivates in the Dragon Palace has to make it through the Dragon Gate Pass. That is the test you must pass,” Ye Rufeng narrated.

“The test in the Dragon Gate is special. It doesn’t test your Cultivation, Spiritual Power, or your Martial Arts Technique. It tests your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.”

“The Dragon Gate has total 13 layers. The first layer requires comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. The higher your comprehension, the more layers you go through. Under normal circumstances, the minimum for joining the Dragon Palace is to make it through the third layer.”

“Because your swordsmanship was executed using your comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale, I think that you are very likely to make it through the third layer. That is why I recommended you,” Ye Rufeng said.

“Based on my comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale, it is very likely that I can make it through the third layer?” Jian Wushuang’s expression became strange.

From what the Golden-armored Sergent said earlier, a new person, like him, that just arrived, was currently going through the Dragon Gate and had already passed through the sixth layer.
