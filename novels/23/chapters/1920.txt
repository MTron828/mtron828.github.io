Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Abysmal Saint Master is determined to kill me. He didn’t even care about the rules of Sanctuary Alliance. He even extinguished Purple Moon Emperor’s consciousness embodiment!!” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

At the same time, Qian Mingzi immediately sent him a message, “Jian Wushuang, master sent me a message. He told you to hold on for a while and that he will arrive personally in his original body soon.”

Jian Wushuang felt extremely solemn.

He wanted Jian Wushuang to withstand for a while in Abysmal Saint Master’s hands?

“Jian Wushuang, as I want to kill you, there is no one in this world who can save you!”

“Die!”

Abysmal Saint Master let his murderous intention soar. He continued to stand on the spot and there wasn’t any obvious movement of his body but the surrounding boundless darkness started churning in madness.

Vroom!!

The boundless darkness substantiated and formed a black spear in front of Jian Wushuang. The black spear could destroy everything.

At the very moment it took shape, every expert revealed a hopeless expression.

A Great Emperor descended and took action personally.

As a Great Emperor, even if it was a casual hit, it’s power wouldn’t be defendable by an ordinary Emperor God.

Then, Abysmal Saint Master took action personally.

Swoosh!

A black spear pierced the void and flew at Jian Wushuang.

As the spear flew at him, Jian Wushuang could only feel the surrounding darkness pressing on him and his power couldn’t be performed under the pressure of the darkness.

He didn’t even have the ability to flee.

Difference!

Jian Wushuang then felt an unprecedented difference in power.

Emperor God and Great Emperor was merely one step apart. However, the one step was vastly different.

“If I didn’t perform my strongest trump card, increasing my power by a thousand times via the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace should be sufficient, or even breaking the spear before me. But now…” Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to block Abysmal Saint Master.

“Jian Yi!”

At the crucial moment, Jian Wushuang roared.

Swoosh!

There was a figure that appeared before Jian Wushuang and it was Jian Wushuang’s servant… Jian Yi.

As his servant, he was absolutely loyal to Jian Wushuang. With Jian Wushuang’s command, even if he was going to die, he would never hesitate.

Then, under Jian Wushuang’s command, Jian Yi immediately pointed with his finger.

With one point, heaven and earth could be destroyed!

There was a ray of black light that burst out. The black light constantly magnified.

It clashed with the black spear directly.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and even spacetime seemed to be unable to endure the power of both parties attacks.

After it clashed, swoosh!

Jian Yi’s figure turned into flowing light and retreated for tens of thousands of miles. Then, he stopped. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Oh?”

Abysmal Saint Master looked Jian Yi in shock, “To be able to block my hit, that’s not too shabby. Maybe you stand a chance to fight against Underworld God. You might even be able to fight with a Great Emperor. It’s a pity that I wasn’t an ordinary Great Emperor like Purple Moon!”

“I am in the top three of Heaven and Earth Supreme Ranking List. All over the world, besides Emperor Bai, who else is my match?”

“How dare you stop me. Now, go to hell together!”

Rumble. Heaven and earth shook.

Abysmal Saint Master, who was at the core of the boundless darkness, attacked straight away.

He was originally standing on the ground and randomly manipulated his divine power as a black spear to attack. But then, he instantly attacked…

“Jian Yi, use that skill!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were like lightning and he let out a scream.

Jian Yi, who stood in front of Jian Wushuang, had blood fog churning on his body. At the same time, there was a golden light that burst out from his eyes.

Simultaneously, his body quivered and a strange bolt of power swept across.

All core experts from Lineage of Star would be familiar with the bolt of power, it was the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Yes, Jian Yi had cultivated Secret Skill of Star Palace as well.

When he was recovering his power in Lineage of Star, he was also preparing for the century war. Jian Wushuang had intentionally sent Jian Yi to Scripture Depository of Lineage of Star so that Jian Yi could receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace.

However, it was a pity that Jian Yi was similar to most of the experts from Lineage of Star, he had only managed to cultivate the first volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace. As for the second volume, although he put in a lot of effort, he hadn’t succeeded.

One should know that Jian Yi’s fighting power could match evenly with an Underworld God’s. When he came across an ordinary Great Emperor like Purple Moon Emperor, who was at the bottom of the rank, he could fight a match.

With such power, if he were to perform the first volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace… He could instantly increase his power by tenfold!

It enabled Jian Yi to possess the fighting power of a Great Emperor in an instant!

The move was also one of the trump cards that Jian Wushuang had prepared in order to prevent the unpredictable.

However, the unpredictable had happened then.

“Jian Yi, block him!” Jian Wushuang roared.

“Roar!”

Jian Yi roared and his aura instantly rose to a brand new level with the support of the power of Star. His body turned illusory and blocked the Abysmal Saint Master.

“The Secret Skill of Star Palace?” Abysmal Saint Master squinted his eyes, “It’s a pity that it was only the first volume and the lasting period is only ten breaths at most. Even if you could hold me back for ten breaths, what happens after the ten breaths?”

Abysmal Saint Master sneered.

His understanding about the secret skill of Star Palace obviously was much higher than the others’.

He even knew the lasting period of the first volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Just as Jian Yi was holding Abysmal Saint Master back, Jian Wushuang thought to himself, “Ten breaths, Jian Yi could only hold him back for ten breaths at most. Within this ten breaths, I have to run with all my strength!”

“Run! Run! Run!”

Jian Wushuang was decisive and he didn’t hesitate at all.

At that very moment, he turned and ran at his fastest speed to the void far away.

He knew that Abysmal Saint Master’s main target was him.

As for Lineage of Star, they shouldn’t be involved. The worst possible scenario would be passing him the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace.

As for the other two alliances, they were heavily defeated and it was impossible for them to pose any threat to Lineage of Star. Even if he ran away, Lineage of Star should be able to stay alive.

However, just as he turned to run, Abysmal Saint Master, who stood by Jian Yi, already saw through his thoughts.

“Want to run?”

“Hehe, unless you’re a Great Emperor, you can’t run away from me in this universe!”

Abysmal Saint Master’s confident laugh reverberated in the universe.

Just as he spoke, the surrounding darkness suddenly came alive like an exotic beast.

The boundless, dark magical clouds formed terrifyingly huge beasts and these beasts were holding metal chains in their mouths.

The darkness covered everything. Rumble. A huge darkness prison appeared out of nowhere.

The entire universe, the entire spacetime was instantly locked.

Jian Wushuang and everyone on the spot were engulfed in the darkness. It was impossible for any of them to run away.
