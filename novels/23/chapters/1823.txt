Chapter 1824: Spare My Life

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The entire Universe became quiet.

Sir God Cang Yu, who was still bathing in the sunlight, originally wore a gentle smile, but then, he couldn’t smile anymore.

The three top Sir Gods had joined forces… but in the end, in the blink of an eye, Sir God Xing Xiang and Sir God Qi Sha were instantly killed.

“Too strong, he was too strong,” Sir God Cang Yu stared at Jian Wushuang, “The two of them are top Sir Gods. Even if a true Emperor God came, it would require some time before they killed them. But Jian Wushuang did an instant kill. A top Sir God couldn’t even struggle in his hands.”

“With such power, I’m afraid he is extremely close to Peak Emperor God level.”

Previously, Sir God Cang Yu, Sir God Qi Sha and Sir God Xing Xiang had thought Jian Wushuang was still only the expert in the sixty-first place in Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list who could evenly match Emperor God Tian Xiao.

They didn’t know how greatly Jian Wushuang had improved in the past six thousand years.

Forget about the rest, his possession of ancient tribe bloodline by bloodline inheritance from Wu Hun, and with his power of bloodline in combination with his divine power, Jian Wushuang was two times stronger than an Emperor God in terms of power and strength. With such ferocious power and strength, any casual Reincarnation Palm could exterminate Sir God Xing Xiang, like slaughtering a chicken.

It was true. To Jian Wushuang, killing a top Sir God was too easy. There was no difference to killing a chicken.

Sir God Cang Yu took a deep breath and flashed a smile. At the same time, he bowed politely to Jian Wushuang. “Thank you for your mercy, Sword Emperor!”

Sir God Cang Yu knew that Jian Wushuang could easily kill him in an instant if he wanted to. Although he had once survived a fight with an Emperor God, the Emperor God was just the weakest of his level. He couldn’t be compared favorably with Jian Wushuang.

But the fact Jian Wushuang didn’t attack meant that Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to kill him.

“It is because of Purple Sky Palace and Emperor God Zi Cang that I spare you. I hope that there won’t be a repeat of what happened today,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes,” Sir God Cang Yu nodded continuously.

Jian Wushuang waved and took Sir God Xing Xiang and Sir God Qi Sha’s dead bodies and their treasures. Then, he left.

Sir God Cang Yu then let out a sigh of relief after he watched Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared from his sight.

“Gate of hell. I, Cang Yu, just took a trip to the gate of hell!”

“Luckily, I am fortunate enough. It seems that Sword Emperor wasn’t as aggressive and lawless as he was pictured in the rumors. He had scruples with Purple Sky Palace and Emperor God Zi Cang,” Sir God Cang Yu muttered.

The three top Sir Gods, Sir God Xing Xiang was Jian Wushuang’s target so he had to be killed.

Sir God Qi Sha was merely a solo expert and he had no background. Hence, Jian Wushuang could kill him with no scruples.

But, the two Sir Gods were different to him. They had a backer so Jian Wushuang let them off the hook.

“However, with Jian Wushuang’s power and Lineage of Star behind him, even if he killed me, Purple Sky Palace couldn’t do anything about him even if they were furious. What is his concern?” Sir God Cang Yu was confused but he immediately reported what had happened to Emperor God Zi Cang behind him.

“Cang Yu, you teamed up with Sir God Qi Sha and Sir God Xing Xiang but Jian Wushuang instantly killed the other two?” Emperor God Zi Cang was surprised at the news.

“Yes, Jian Wushuang is terrifyingly powerful, far stronger than when he fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace six thousand years ago,” Sir God Cang Yu said.

“Tsk tsk. He is truly an expert. In just a short timespan, his power increased to another level. Maybe to us, six thousand years is only a snap of our fingers. But to Jian Wushuang, six thousand years is enough for him to improve tremendously,” Emperor Zi Cang sighed. “According to the power that he displayed, he should be listed in the top fifty or forty on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Such a figure shouldn’t be provoked!”

“Luckily, he left you some leeway and didn’t kill you. Otherwise, Purple Sky Palace really couldn’t do anything about him.”

“Palace Master, isn’t Jian Wushuang devoid of scruples all this while and willing to fight over the smallest trifles? I took the initiative to provoke him but he spared my life. Why? Did he really hesitate because of Purple Sky Palace?” Sir God Cang Yu asked in confusion. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Who knows? As he showed mercy, Purple Sky Palace shall accept it. From today, do not become hostile towards Lineage of Star. Even if Lineage of Star’s disciples were to be in our hands, we shall let them off the hook,” Emperor God Zi Cang said.

“I understand,” Sir God Cang Yu nodded.

Just as Sir God Cang Yu was talking to Sir God Zi Cang, Jian Wushuang had already left Red Dragon Sanctuary via a wormhole and departed to his next destination.

As for the reason he had showed mercy to Sir God Cang Yu, it wasn’t because Jian Wushuang had a good temper and was easy to talk to but because Lineage of Star was in a different situation.

When the Master of Star Palace was still around, all forces had scruples. Jian Wushuang could just kill Sir God Cang Yu.

But then, the Master of Star Palace had passed away. Even a slight bit of the news spreading would attract many forces and experts to attack instantly. At such a crucial moment, Jian Wushuang naturally tried not to offend any major forces.

For instance, Purple Sky Palace was considered a major force and there was an Emperor God who was in commanding position. Although Emperor God Zi Cang’s power was ordinary, Jian Wushuang didn’t want to offend him unless necessary.

“The next target, East Royal Sanctuary, Sir God Ling Gu!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes filled with murderous intention.

Very soon, a God killer descended in East Royal Sanctuary.

In the vast void.

“Sword Emperor, spare me and I guarantee that I wouldn’t be hostile towards Lineage of Star!” A grey-robed, cold-looking woman fled ahead. As she ran, she shouted.

“I’m sorry. Since you slaughtered countless cultivators in a city of Star Land to take revenge, the resentment between Lineage of Star and you can’t be resolved. You, have to die!” Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate. He performed Secret Skill of Dragon Blood and caught up to Sir God Ling Gu. He then killed her straight away with a thunderous method.

When Jian Wushuang had killed Sir God Xing Xiang and Sir God Qi Sha previously, he had been so quick that the two Sir Gods didn’t even have a chance to send any messages. Plus, Sir God Cang Yu had appreciated Jian Wushuang’s mercy and hadn’t spread the news.

But then, Jian Wushuang had killed Sir God Ling Gu before everyone’s eyes. The news naturally spread.

In an instant, the entire Sanctuary Alliance shook because of the name Sword Emperor once again.
