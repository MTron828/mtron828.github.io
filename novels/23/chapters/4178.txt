“Let’s go, Jian Wushuang. Tell us where you’ve been for the past thousand years. Even I can’t see through you now.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng pulled Jian Wushuang and prepared to enter the palace.

For the past 1000 years, Divine Marquis Qingfeng had been filled with guilt over Jian Wushuang’s finger. He thought that it was him who had dragged Jian Wushuang down and caused him to be unable to escape Qing Xuzi’s pursuit.

Even though the Ruler Blood Wave had sent them a message later to inform them that Jian Wushuang was not dead, the guilt in his heart had not lessened at all.

Now, he finally saw that Jian Wushuang had returned safely and seemed to be stronger than before. The guilt in his heart that was hanging in his throat finally settled.

“Aren’t you going to continue to select experts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Divine Marquis Qingfeng did not reply, but Ninth Kalpa King shook his head and snorted in disdain. “If they have the strength to take my palm, they would have come out long ago. Those who are still here and don’t dare to try are just some stinky fish and rotten shrimp. Even if there are people who can take my palm, they are just cowards. What’s the use of them?”

“You’re quite clear on this.” Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

Soon, the three of them entered the palace.

Ruler Spear River and the others who had passed the Ninth Kalpa King’s test followed closely behind in awe.

The palace gate slowly closed.

“What?” The many Ultimate Rulers present could not help but look at each other in shock.

“What is this? Aren’t we competing?”

“From the looks of it, we probably won’t be able to enter the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp.”

The Ultimate Rulers who had not tried shook their heads with bitter smiles.

However, they had already expected this outcome, and it was their own choice. Therefore, they were not too depressed.

Compared to this, they were more concerned about the identity of the fourth-level Ruler who had appeared last and cut through the Ninth Kalpa King’s giant palm with one sword.

“Everyone, from what I saw just now, this fourth-level Ruler with extremely terrifying strength seems to know the Ninth Kalpa King and the others?”

“You’re talking nonsense. When did you see the expressions of the Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Marquis Qingfeng? When have they ever been so friendly to us?”

“Given his power as a fourth-level chief Ruler, he should be extremely famous throughout the universe. How come I’ve never heard of someone like him before?”

Just as everyone was in doubt and whispering to each other, an Ultimate Ruler suddenly thought of something and exclaimed, “I know who that person was!”

“Eh? Who is he?”

Everyone turned to look at the Ultimate Ruler.

The Ultimate Ruler took a deep breath, then said in a low voice, “I’m sure you’re all familiar with the battle in Fengyang Canyon 1000 years ago?”

Everyone nodded. A thousand years ago, in the Fengyang Canyon, all the top forces had fought each other for a divine medicine that could increase the chance of breaking through to the Supreme level. Naturally, they were familiar with that. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Do you still remember that there was a fourth-level Ruler in the Ninth Kalpa King’s team?” The final Ruler continued.

“Hmm…I remember, there was such a person back then.”

“That’s right. I remember that he fought with Qing Xuzi for a while and was not at a disadvantage at all. I was there at the time, and I was surprised for a while.”

“The black-robed swordsman was the one who fought with Qing Xuzi a thousand years ago?”

1,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang had fought with Qing Xuzi head-on as a fourth stage Ruler. The battle was dazzling and the news had spread. Now that it was pointed out, everyone immediately remembered it.

At the same time, everyone remembered that after the battle in Fengyang Canyon, Qing Xuzi had gone after this man at all costs.

“Then this person is in big trouble. A thousand years ago, Son of God Qing Xu chased after this person, but his whereabouts were unknown. The people of the Great Void Temple have been searching for Son of God Qing Xu all this time.”

“That’s right. Back then, Son of God Qing Xu disappeared because he was chasing after this person. Now that this person has returned safely, the people from the Great Void Temple will definitely come to find him.”

“Tsk, tsk. That Qing Xuzi is the current divine son of the Great Void Temple. he can be said to be the most outstanding genius in the past hundreds, if not thousands of chaos cycles. In the end, he disappeared in the Tarot Ruins because he was chasing after this person. That’s not all. however, this person has returned safely. It’s obvious that the people of the Great Void Temple will be furious and vent all their anger on this person.”

“Let’s wait and see. Once the people from the Great Void Temple hear about this, they will come to find this person soon.”

Many Ultimate Rulers shook their heads and discussed. They did not think Jian Wushuang’s future would be promising.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s performance just now was very strong, one must know that the Great Void Temple was a great undying force that shook the entire universe!

…

In the hall, Jian Wushuang, Ninth Kalpa King, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng sat cross-legged. In front of them were three low tea tables with a few pots of spirit wine on them.

“Jian Wushuang, can you tell me where you have been for the past thousand years?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng asked with a smile.

The Ninth Kalpa King remained silent at the side, but his eyes inadvertently glanced at Jian Wushuang. It could be seen that he was also very curious about where Jian Wushuang had been in the past one thousand years and why his aura had changed so much after he returned.

Jian Wushuang picked up his wine cup and took a sip. Then he said, “It’s a long story. When Qing Xuzi was chasing me, I had no choice but to keep running. In the end, I ran to a special place at the edge of the Tarot Ruins. There, I got rid of Qing Xuzi and obtained some special opportunities, which improved my strength. As for my aura, I just concealed it with some means.”

Jian Wushuang only gave a simple explanation.

He did not plan to tell anyone about the second level of the Tarot Ruins. After all, it was a matter of great importance. The things inside were enough to make a Supreme Master jealous. Speaking of which, Divine Marquis Qingfeng and Ninth Kalpa King had gone through life and death with him. However, it was hard to predict a person’s heart. No one knew if the two of them would have any evil intentions after knowing that Jian Wushuang had obtained the greatest opportunity in the second level of the Tarot Ruins.

Even if the two of them did not do anything, once the news was leaked, Jian Wushuang knew without a doubt that the entire universe would come after him. Even the divine Palace of life would not be able to protect him.

After all, it was the inheritance of Ruler Tarot!

Just the various treasures and universe origin stones inside were enough to make many experts in the universe boil, not to mention the Tarot sword manual, which was an unrivaled super power that shocked the ancient times, as well as the famous Tarot Divine Sword.
