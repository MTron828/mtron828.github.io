2034 Escape!

Jian Wushuang fought as he retreated and he left the parameter of the golden whirlpool. He moved in the direction of Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

Just as the golden whirlpool was experiencing a drastic change, in Doctrine Propagation Palace.

Ninety-nine percent of the cultivators in Imperial Peak were gathered there. They were originally waiting for the leaders of the Peak Chaotic to arrive.

But then…

“What’s going on? Why are the leaders leaving?”

“The Doctrine Propagation Ceremony just began and the leaders have yet to start sharing doctrines, but they left?”

“Did something happen?”

The cultivators were confused.

Even the deacons of the Imperial Cabinet were confused.

No one knew what had happened.

Suddenly,

Hong!

There was a vigorous bang that resounded in Imperial Peak. All the cultivators in Doctrine Propagation Palace naturally heard it at the first instant.

Simultaneously, they detected the intense divine power that burst out from afar.

“What’s going on?”

“This... what happened?”

The cultivators couldn’t stay calm anymore. They departed to the void above Doctrine Propagation Palace one after another.

When they arrived in the void, they could faintly see the huge movement that had taken place in the golden whirlpool at the end of their vision.

The cultivators who were at an early stage and middle stage Chaotic Realm were astonished.

“Someone is fighting in the golden whirlpool?”

“Who is it? How dare he!”

“No wonder the five leaders left instantly.”

As they gasped and exclaimed in shock, there was someone who plunged out of the golden whirlpool.

The first two that appeared were naturally Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao. As the two of them plunged out, they flew in the direction of Great Emperor Zhi Luo with their all.

Not long after the two of them left, Jian Wushuang and the other twelve Great Emperors who were attacking him left the golden whirlpool as well.

They were fighting in madness all the while.

The cultivators in Doctrine Propagation Palace were shocked when they saw the sight.

“Twelve, twelve leaders?”

“Twelve leaders joined forces to besiege one person? Oh goodness! Am I seeing this wrongly? And the person seems to be in early stage Chaotic Realm!”

“How is it possible? He is only in early stage Chaotic Realm. It would be impossible for him to block one leader. How could he block twelve at the same time?”

Everyone exclaimed in surprise and disbelief.

However, no matter whether they believed it or not, the truth was as such.

After they exited the golden whirlpool, Jian Wushuang continued to fight as he retreated. His divine body was extremely huge. He relied on Sword Principle Xuan Luo along with Nine Heads and Eighteen Arms to block all the attacks from the twelve Great Emperors. The twelve Great Emperors were fighting with their all.

Although the twelve Great Emperors gave their all and their attacks hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body over and over again, Jian?Wushuang was unbeatable. His aura was maintained at his peak.

He had truly blocked twelve Great Emperors alone.

“That, that person…”

Among the crowd in Doctrine Propagation Palace, Lin Tianhao was staring at the figure who was besieged by twelve Great Emperors with his eyes wide open.

Although Jian Wushuang’s divine body increased in size, he had yet to remove his disguise. He maintained his appearance as a brawny man. Lin Tianhao naturally recognized him at first glance.

“Ah Shou, he’s Ah Shou!!!”

“How is it possible? How could it be him?”

Lin Tianhao looked on in disbelief and he roared.

“Ah Shou, it’s him?”

There were people who exclaimed in surprise by the side too.

Jian Wushuang had stayed in Imperial Peak for twenty years and he knew some people. These people recognized Jian Wushuang then.

They found it unbelievable because they recognized him.

From what they remembered, although Ah Shou was brawny, fierce and unreasonable, his power was truly of a cultivator in early stage Chaotic Realm, just like them.

Especially Lin Tianhao, he had even defeated him once when he’d fought with Ah Shou.

No one had ever been in doubt of Ah Shou’s power. They’d thought his power was normal.

Maybe, Jian Wushuang disguised it too well. Regardless of if it was his power or his character, he had played it flawlessly well.

But now… he was fighting against twelve Great Emperors alone. Even the twelve Great Emperors couldn’t do anything about him. That’s just how powerful he was.

“This guy!!!” Lin Tianhao clenched his fists as he was shocked.

“Tianhao, he is the person that we ran into at the border of the great formation, right?” The handsome man next to Lin Tianhao muttered with shock on his face.

Before everyone’s astonished gazes, Jian Wushuang and his troops moved to the border of Imperial Peak, where the great formation was.

At the border of the great formation, Great Emperor Zhi Luo had been concealing her aura and hiding in a corner. There was a slight spacetime gap next to her. The gap was very small but it was made with the price of the ancient treasure.

While Jian Wushuang and the other two Great Emperors took action, Great Emperor Zhi Luo had been waiting.

But then, Great Emperor Zhi Luo looked distressed.

“Failed?”

“It’s a trap?”

“How could it be?”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo clenched her teeth and her body was quivering.

Then, there were two figures charging at her from the void in front of her.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao, hurry up. Hurry up…” Great Emperor Zhi Luo obviously had yet to finish her sentence but she suddenly stopped. Her eyes dilated in shock at that very moment.

Vroom. Suddenly, there was a fierce aura soaring up behind her. Then, a figure slowly substantiated.

The figure was a tall and sturdy middle-aged man who was faintly discernible.

The tall and sturdy middle-aged man appeared behind Great Emperor Zhi Luo without any sign.

“Oh, I see. The last fish is here. She even made a spacetime tunnel to connect to the outside world. Quite capable I see,” the tall and sturdy middle-aged man muttered. Then, his palm slammed the back of Great Emperor Zhi Luo at lightning speed.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo felt a tug in her heart. She wanted to dodge but she realized that the palm was locked onto her.

She had no choice but to take the palm forcibly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As she greeted the palm… Bang!

There was a loud bang and Great Emperor’s body quivered. She tasted a faint sweetness in her throat and blood flowed out of the corner of her lips.

“This person is so strong!!” Great Emperor Zhi Luo was shocked.

Although she was only considered an ordinary Great Emperor in Eternal Chaotic World, she was a Great Emperor after all, but the other party had injured her so easily with just one palm. Even Abysmal Saint Master couldn’t do that. There was no doubt that the person in front of her was a super expert who was no weaker than Ling Zong.
