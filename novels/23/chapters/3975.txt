Chapter 3977: Soul Extraction

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is this the reason why you controlled the Sorcerer God sect and captured special life forms and cultivators from special races?” Jian Wushuang stared at Star Demon Ancestor, then he asked, “I’m curious. Since it’s so difficult for you to recover your soul in this Star Field, why didn’t you choose to go to other Star Fields?”

“Haha, other Star Fields?” Star Demon Ancestor laughed, “First of all, the void of the universe is filled with endless dangers. Not to mention other things, just the large number of space pirates who roam the void of the universe all year round is a big problem. If my strength was at its peak, it wouldn’t be a problem for me to go to other Star Fields. However, the key point is that my soul is severely injured and I don’t have much strength left. Under such circumstances, if I go to other Star Fields alone, I might die if I’m not careful. The risk is too great.”

“Of course, the most important point is that I know about the existence of the Divine Beginning Realm. I also know that Devil Cloud Star Master has already taken over the Divine Beginning Realm. From that moment on, I’ve already started to plot against this Devil Cloud Star Master.”

“I first took the initiative to find this Devil Cloud Star Master and told him how to use the Divine Beginning Realm’s value to the extreme at the fastest speed. After Devil Cloud Star Master heard this, he was indeed moved. After all, he also hopes that his power can increase at the fastest speed.”

“Thus, I came to the Divine Beginning Realm and joined hands with the three great holy realms to start setting up. However, Devil Cloud Star Master didn’t know that the method I proposed could indeed squeeze out the potential of the Divine Beginning Realm in the shortest time. However, the one who benefited in the end wasn’t him, but me.”

“If everything goes according to the plan, after the plan is completed, I can borrow the power of the Divine Beginning Realm to recover my soul power completely. In fact, it will be even stronger than before. Unfortunately, because of your appearance, the three holy realms were destroyed. Even I can’t stay in the Divine Beginning Realm anymore. Thus, Devil Cloud Star Master had to come personally. As for my previous plan, I can only change it.”

“However, I never expected that you would seriously injure Devil Cloud Star Master in this battle. You even forced him into a desperate situation, forcing him to burn more than half of his soul. This simply created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.”

“I knew that I couldn’t wait any longer, so i directly attacked and devoured Devil Cloud Star Master’s soul until now…”

“Jian Wushuang, I really have to thank you. If you hadn’t forced the Star Master into such a miserable state, I don’t know when my plan would have been realized. But now, there’s no need. There’s no need for anything. After devouring the soul of the Star Master, my soul has already recovered by more than half. It’s much easier to recover the rest.” Star Demon Ancestor laughed heartily.

After hearing Star Demon’s words, Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened.

He completely understood in his heart that Star Demon progenitor had actually started plotting against Devil Cloud Star Master a long time ago, what was laughable was that the Star Master actually thought that the plan put forward by the Star Demon Ancestor was to make him better display the value of the Divine Beginning Realm.

What he did not know was that all the efforts of the Star Devil Cloud Star Master had been in vain for Star Demon progenitor. Up until now, even his soul, his divine body, and everything he had…it’s all been taken from us by this Star Demon.

“Star Demon Ancestor, you’ve calculated for a long time and have successfully occupied everything of the Star Master. But there’s one thing you’ve forgotten,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Forgot what?” Star Demon Elder ancestor looked over.

“Have you forgotten the condition of the Star Master? He was severely injured before you devoured his soul. I’m afraid he won’t be able to use 10% of his strength. Although you’ve taken over his divine body again, how much of his strength can you use at his peak?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. “I don’t care if you’re the Sorcerer God, Star Demon Ancestor, or Devil Cloud Star Master. As long as I kill you here, everything will be over.”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent surged, and the Wuqi divine sword in his hand trembled slightly. A shocking murderous aura swept out.

“Keke, you want to kill me?” Star Demon Ancestor looked at Jian Wushuang with interest. “Jian Wushuang, in the Eternal Dark Prison, what you saw was just a divine body controlled by my soul. At that time, you had the token of the Red Cloud Lineage, so you were invincible. No matter how powerful I am, it’s useless. But today, I’ll show you my real skills.”

As soon as Star Demon Ancestor finished his words, he moved.

Without any warning, Star Demon Ancestor appeared in a cosmic void outside the array formation. He was not far behind Shi Hua Divine Emperor. His speed was so fast that it was as though he had teleported.

Star Demon Ancestor stared at Shi Hua Divine Emperor in front of him as a hint of fanaticism flashed in his eyes. Following that, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Chains that were transparent and emitted a special aura burst out from Star Demon Ancestor’s body. These chains were soul chains. There were nine of them, and each of them contained a rich soul aura.

The nine chains covered Shi Hua Divine Emperor at the fastest speed.

“What?” Shi Hua Divine Emperor was shocked.

He did not expect that Star Demon Ancestor would not only attack suddenly, but also target him.

It was Jian Wushuang who wanted to kill him, but Star Demon Ancestor attacked him at the first moment?

“Humph!” Shi Hua Divine Emperor snorted. After all, he was a fourth-level Ruler and was not weak. He wanted to destroy the nine souls at the first moment.

Then, the nine soul chains that burst out from Star Demon Ancestor’s body were not affected by the material attacks. They even passed through the material attacks and covered Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s divine body in the blink of an eye.

Shi Hua Divine Emperor wanted to struggle, but the moment the nine soul chains touched his divine body, his body trembled and a hint of horror appeared in his eyes.

Immediately following that, many experts in the surrounding battlefield could see that Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul body had been forcefully pulled out of his divine body by the nine soul chains.

The nine soul chains completely bound Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul body before rushing in the direction of Star Demon Ancestor.

As for Star Demon Ancestor, he opened his mouth and a gigantic black vortex appeared instantly.

“No!”

Shi Hua Divine Emperor let out a hysterical roar. However, under the restraints of the nine soul chains, he did not have any room to struggle. In the blink of an eye, he had already fallen into the black vortex, he was mercilessly devoured by the black vortex.

Furthermore, after devouring Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul, Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s divine body rushed toward the black vortex. Similarly, he was devoured by the black vortex.
