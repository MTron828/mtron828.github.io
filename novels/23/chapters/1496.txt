Chapter 1497: Wu Bei’s Cave

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“After acquiring the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit tree, Real God Wu Bei went into hiding and no one knew where he was. Naturally, no one knew what had happened to the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit tree either. It wasn’t until later on that a great battle broke out and it lasted for a long period of time. Real God Wu Bei lost his life in this great battle and the information regarding the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit tree was gone.”

“Up until now, when millions of years have passed, no one knew where that sapling of the White Blaze Fruit was.”

“However, a month ago, the Vientiane Tower obtained a White Blaze Fruit. At the same time, they found out that the White Blaze Fruit was found in a cave that was concealed cleverly. There is a high possibility that that cave was left behind by Real God Wu Bei. As soon as the news got out, many Almighties in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries were astounded,” Hall Master Yuan said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang could imagine the situation.

The White Blaze Fruit was already so precious. Hence, the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit tree was more than enough to cause many Almighties to fight for it crazily.

Since the cave left behind by Real God Wu Bei had been discovered and the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit might be inside, it would be strange if the Almighties were not shaken up.

“Since so many Almighties had been shaken up, the fight for the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit tree would definitely be between them. Hence, how is this related to us?” Jian Wushuang said doubtfully.

So many Almighties were participating in the fight for the sapling and he was merely a Universe God. Hence, why would he head to the cave and fight with the Almighties?

“This matter is not as easy as you think,” Hall Master Yuan laughed and said: “I have just said that Real God Wu Bei’s abilities are extraordinary and he has many tricks up his sleeve. Now, it has been confirmed that the cave was left behind by him. However, he set up a very special seal. The seal is extremely high-class and it is not known where it came from. Moreover, the Almighties in the Eternal Chaotic World are completely helpless against the seal as they cannot break it!”

“Due to the presence of the seal, Almighties and Real Gods are unable to enter the cave. Only Real Gods and below, meaning Universe Gods like you, are permitted to enter.”

“Only Universe Gods are permitted to enter?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “Why did Real God Wu Bei leave behind this kind of seal?”

“Who knows? Since the Almighties are blocked off from the cave, they have no choice but to allow Universe Gods like you to enter the cave and fight for the White Blaze Fruit. The most important thing is to fight for the White Blaze Fruit tree,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood. Hall Master Yuan, you looked for me this round as you wanted me to enter Real God Wu Bei’s cave and fight for the White Blaze Fruit,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s right. White Blaze Fruit is very useful to Almighties. My family’s Palace Master has some use for it as well. Since there is an opportunity to obtain it, we would naturally not miss it,” Hall Master Yuan chuckled, “Also, even if there were no White Blaze Fruits in the cave that Real God Wu Bei left behind, you would still have to make a trip there.”

“You’re right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Real God Wu Bei was an Inverse Cultivator. By relying on the Inverse Cultivation Methods, he had achieved the peak of a Real God and could even compete with the Almighties.

As for Jian Wushuang, the Inverse Cultivation Method Heavenly Creation Skill that he possessed could only be honed to the level of the Universe Gods!

He had never possessed training methods higher than that of the level of Universe Gods.

Without the method, even if his abilities were enough, he would forever be unable to make a breakthrough and become a Real God.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had already made plans. After making it through the Third Heaven’s Inverse Cultivation Test, he would depend on the Lineage of Star and the Vientiane Tower to find the cultivation method for the Heavenly Creation Skill of the Real God’s level.

At that very moment, Real God Wu Bei’s cave was in sight. Inside the cave, Jian Wushuang might have a chance to obtain what he wanted.

“All right, if there is nothing else, you should make a move immediately,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. Without any delay, he made a move and headed toward Wu Bei’s cave.

…

The Wind Fire Sea of the Red Dragon Sanctuary. The cave which was originally unheard of was filled with people at that moment.

Many experts gathered in the island.

Those experts include a great number of Real Gods and a decent number of Almighties.

However, it was a pity that Wu Bei’s cave had only allowed Universe Gods to enter. Hence, even though the Real Gods and Almighties possessed exceptional abilities, they could only stay outside the cave and watch. The most they could do was send some Universe Gods into the cave and help them fight for the White Blaze Fruit.

Rustle!

When Jian Wushuang arrived at the island, he was surprised by the situation on the island.

“So many experts.”

Jian Wushuang spread his Soul Power and he could feel that in the island, hundreds of Real Gods had gathered. In addition, most of the Real Gods were extremely strong.

As for the Almighties… Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power was still unable to sense the existence of the Almighties.

Aside from being filled with admiration, Jian Wushuang focused his attention on a space passage in the deepest part of the island.

“That is the entrance to enter Wu Bei’s cave?”

After mumbling to himself, Jian Wushuang flew up and plunged toward the entrance.

Quite a number of people on the island had noticed the arrival of Jian Wushuang.

“Another Universe God has come!”

“By the looks of this Universe God, it seems to be Jian Wushuang who is ranked twenty on the Universe God ranking list!”

“Yes, it’s Jian Wushuang, a Star Palace disciple of the Lineage of Star.”

“Hehe. The Lineage of Star is far away at the Purple Moon Sanctuary. However, they are also interested in Wu Bei’s cave. Previously, they sent Long Ya and Xuan Yi, the two disciples who have made it onto the Universe God ranking list. At the very moment, they have also sent Jian Wushuang over. Could it be that they are not scared that the three of them will die in this fight?”

Some of the experts on the island were sighing. However, they were not too concerned.

This fight for the White Blaze Fruit involved many Almighties. With these Almighties taking action, many experts on the Universe God ranking list were invited.

Although Jian Wushuang was ranked in the top twenty on the Universe God ranking list, among the experts of the Universe God ranking list who were participating in this fight, there were a few of them with rankings higher than his.

Buzz!

After passing through the entrance in the deepest part of the island, Jian Wushuang arrived in a vast and independent space.

The independent space was similar to the outside world. There was a sun in the sky. Mountains, forests and water were present as well.

“Jian Wushuang, Long Ya and Xuan Yi entered Wu Bei’s cave a month ago. I have also tidied up some information and sent it to you. Please take a look. This information contains what happened to Long Ya and Xuan Yi in Wu Bei’s cave over the month, as well as the basic situation of this cave,” Hall Master Yuan messaged.

“Also, Lei Chao is about to go to the island personally. At that time, he will pay attention to what is happening outside from time to time. This includes which experts of the Universe God has come as well as the changes in the cave. He will also send all this information to you immediately.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and cut off the transmission.

“Although a special seal exists in Wu Bei’s cave, communication with the outside world is not completely cut off. Within this cave, we are still able to communicate with the people in the outside world,” Jian Wushuang muttered.
