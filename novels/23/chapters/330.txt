“Fourth Sister.”

Jian Wushuang took a solemn look at Su Rou before speaking in a low and deep voice, “All along, you have seen this Ye Chen fella as your benefactor because he saved you and helped you take revenge. But do you know who ordered Blissful Island to annihilate your tribe in the first place?”

“Huh?” Su Rou turned her attention toward Jian Wushuang involuntarily.

“I’m telling you, this Ye Chen fella was the person who ordered the annihilation of your tribe and also the ringleader behind the massacre of your kin,” Jian Wushuang stated piercingly.

“What?” Su Rou was stunned for a moment before she began to shake her head repeatedly. “Impossible!”

“You think so?” Jian Wushuang laughed derisively. “Your tribe was situated within a middle-sized empire. Have you never asked yourself what kind of business brought someone like Master Ye Chen there, and how he rescued you by coincidence?”

“What’s more, why do you think the only survivor among your clan happened to be you?”

Su Rou was slightly stumped.

These questions had popped up in her head before, but she never thought too much about them.

“That is impossible. Why would Master do that?” Su Rou shook her head frantically while turning her eyes toward Ye Chen. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph, baseless accusations,” Ye Chen responded dismissively.

“Baseless?” Jian Wushuang sneered, but a heavy Force of Gale and Thunderbolt gradually began to build up in his body.

Swish!

His body suddenly transformed into a streak of thundering light which burst forth.

Because of the close distance and the unexpectedness of Jian Wushuang’s offensive, even the experts of Ice Nether Valley could not react promptly. By the time they did, Jian Wushuang was already right in front of one of them.

This person was none other than the black-clothed elder who had been following behind Ye Chen like a slave.

In fact, he had been doing so for more than a decade, and was a half-saint.

He was startled by Jian Wushuang’s sudden appearance in front of him. Subsequently, he saw the latter reach a palm out directly toward his face.

His complexion changed drastically as he forcibly shifted his body to one side, evading the fatal palm. Despite missing, Jian Wushuang sniggered nevertheless. A unique Spiritual Power emanated from the center of his palm and swept out towards the elder’s face.

Having accomplished what he wanted, Jian Wushuang reappeared at his original spot in a flash of lightning.

“Fourth Sister, take a look at that person once more and see if you recognize him,” he muttered while pointing at the black-clothed elder.

Su Rou looked frowningly toward the elder, but she quickly noticed that his features had changed.

“Disguise Skill?”

Many of the experts standing around were equally astounded.

None of them had ever imagined that the black-clothed elder who followed beside Ye Chen persistingly had all along been hiding his true face by using the Disguise Skill. It lost its effect because Jian Wushuang had smeared something special on the center of his palm which caused a reaction when the Spiritual Power from the attack swept past the elder’s face.

After seeing the elder’s true appearance, Su Rou’s expression turned from shock to disbelief, and then eventually to immense rage.

“It’s you!” her voice became ice-cold and piercing to the extreme.

It was a face she had committed to memory since that day, more than ten years ago, when she was still a young child. It was a face she would never forget.

After all, this was the face of the Master who led Blissful Island in the massacre of her tribe and kin.

She had thought that this person was long dead. Instead, not only was he standing in front of her right now, but he had also been following beside Ye Chen all this time and even had frequent contact with her.

“Lord of Blissful Island, Fan Hong!”

“Do you believe me now?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

The reason he was sure that there was incontrovertible evidence, was because among the information found by the Alchemy School, was the discovery that the servant who persistently followed Ye Chen was none other than Fan Hong, the Lord of Blissful Island who annihilated Su Rou’s tribe all those years ago.

This proof was as solid as a mountain.

So much so that Su Rou was compelled to believe it.

She raised her head and peered toward Ye Chen once more, albeit this time with a wholly different look.

“Master, I need an explanation from you!” Su Rou’s figure was visibly quivering.

Ye Chen’s complexion became unsightly at once.

An uproar erupted in the Drill Ground.

Having understood the truth of the matter, nearly everyone became doubtful of the so-called Master Saint.

“Master Saint? How can someone who conducts himself like this have the right to be called such?”

“I always saw this Ye Chen fella as an honorable and forthright person. I never expected him to be such a fraud.”

“Shameless hypocrite!”

Contemptuous remarks rang out across the Drill Ground.

Consequently, the complexions of many of the experts of Ice Nether Valley became somewhat unpleasant. The Valley Master began to holler, “Little one, you not only ordered people to destroy the foundations of my sect’s formation, you also shamelessly spread nonsense here. Could it be that you think my Ice Nether Valley is easy to bully?”

“If a tiger doesn’t show its might, it will indeed be mistaken as a sick cat!”

“You and your friends can forget about leaving here today!”

“Elders, come out!”

The Valley Master’s loud and emphatic voice reverberated throughout the area.

In the blink of an eye, a massive and thick aura shot up into the sky. Many experts of Ice Nether Valley, including several Saint Realm Elders who had achieved Divine Transcendence, appeared in quick succession near Jian Wushuang and co.

“Heh, you want a fight?” Jian Wushuang said and sneered while slowly reaching behind his back to grasp his long sword.

A cool breeze whooshed past just as his palm made contact with the hilt of his long sword. Five figures appeared, near-simultaneously, behind his back.

Including Old Weirdo Yunyang, who had already revealed himself previously, there were now six people behind him.

Among the six was Wine Master, whose white robes, hair, and beard flapped around, even though there was no wind.

The hoary-looking Lady Black, dressed in black, with her indifferent countenance.

Known for being carefree, the two Wind and Rain Immortals, who were jointly called the “Immortal Couple”, stood there, nonchalantly, with a smile on the corners of their mouths.

Old Weirdo Yunyang interlocked his hands, with a hint of mischief in his eyes.

Conversely, Chi Mei stood stiffly where he was with a glum expression on his face.

Aside from the six of them, there was Jian Wushuang, who was gradually pulling his long sword out, as well as Yang Zaixuan, whose body emitted a loftier-than-thou aura.

Right here on the Drill Ground, in Ice Nether Valley, eight horrifying and earthshaking auras burst out violently.

In the blink of an eye, the sky and earth were torn apart.

The suppressive forces formed by the auras alone caused the entire Drill Ground to fall into a grave silence.

The entire surface of the Drill Ground even seemed to cave in completely.

At the forefront of these eight people was Jian Wushuang, who was clearly the leader. Clutching his green-tipped sword, his peerless Sword Essence rose into the sky, making him appear as if he was a peerless master who had arrived from ancient times. His eyes, which carried a faint trace of arrogance, looked around as hostile words poured out of his mouth.

“Whether I can be kept back will depend on your capability, Ice Nether Valley!”
