Chapter 5510 ¬†The Power of Life

No one could be relied upon.

It was always Jian Wushuang that one had to rely on.

When Jian Wushuang rose, everything improved.

Zhen Ling was always Zhen Ling; there would inevitably come a day when the old would give way. Once a suitable successor appeared, Zhen Ling would have to step down.

At that time, Jian Wushuang would be the one in charge, doing whatever he pleased!

The Elder Palace, the Four Great Temples‚Äîthey all belonged to him.

Wu Zuo was having grand dreams, directly reaching the Origin Source Sea of the Qishen Temple.

"Lord Zhen Ling, Jian Wushuang has broken through again; he now has the battle power of a tier 6 Emperor!" Wu Zuo came specifically this time to sing praises of Jian Wushuang.

Zhen Ling blinked, understanding Wu Zuo's little scheme.

With a hint of wickedness in his smile, Zhen Ling said, "Since that's the case, he deserves a reward!"

"But recently, as you know, all the treasures are with Zhu Yi. It's not easy to mobilize them. So, this time, you can go on my behalf and give something to Jian Wushuang. Say it's from you. I'll make it up to you later. Whether it's more or less, it's the thought that counts. Anyway, there's a 90 percent chance that the future of the Qishen Temple belongs to him!"

Zhen Ling dug another big hole for Wu Zuo.

As for whether Jian Wushuang was the successor, he had long had the answer in his heart.

The Universe Master was most suitable for Jian Wushuang. The positions of the three major godheads could be determined. As for the successor of the Qishen Temple, in the chaos before creation, anything was possible.

But it would never be Jian Wushuang.

Originally, according to his intention, not to mention the position of a Divine Master, he wouldn't even give the inheritance of the Universe Master to Jian Wushuang. However, now it seemed that with the dissipation of the evil aura around Jian Wushuang, a position as a Divine Master could be arranged.

This also justified Jian Wushuang's potential.

As for the position of Qishen, he had other plans.

At the moment, whether it was the outstanding Inheritors like Shang, Hu Qing, or Jian Wushuang among the extraordinary heirs, or the Inheritors of special Origin Sources, they were not within his considerations.

The one inheriting the position of Qishen must have a clean foundation.

He feared that the predicted person who inherited the position of Qishen would lead Qishen Temple to its demise.

Jian Wushuang was very likely that person. Despite having hope in Hu Qing initially, he refrained from placing bets on her after noticing changes in her timeline and future, fearing the uncertainties.

In the Grave God Mountain, there were several practitioners who had achieved perfection in the Ultimate Dao, each concealing their strength, yet all extremely powerful. They could rival even the tier 5 Emperors.

He could freely examine the timelines of these individuals and held high expectations for them.

In the future, if any unforeseen events occurred, these individuals would be reliable.

Behind Jian Wushuang, there were people who nurtured him as an Inheritor, only to be eventually used as pawns by others.

Zhen Ling was not foolish!

Only Wu Zuo remained consistently straightforward. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

"Umm..." Wu Zuo hesitated. Most of his treasures had been given to Jian Wushuang, and the remaining ones, mostly the ones he used, were insufficient to provide more. If he invested further, he would have to sell his own treasures.

However, as Zhen Ling had stated, the future belonged to Jian Wushuang, with a 90 percent probability, which was 20 higher than the last time he was informed.

He gritted his teeth and reluctantly agreed.

If necessary, he would make a fortune while Jian Wushuang was at the Beiwang Tower.

It was chaotic there, and even the temple itself was too busy to notice him.

But he couldn't be too stingy. Since Jian Wushuang had not yet achieved integration with the Dao, he would need treasures for that. Wu Zuo decided to find treasures based on this criterion.

If there were none in the mortal realm, he would use treasures to exchange with Zhu Yi.

Thinking this, Wu Zuo didn't dare to delay any longer. He quickly withdrew and had Zhen Ling teleport him to the mortal realm.

The crucial point was that no matter how many treasures he spent, Zhen Ling would ultimately compensate him. He would gain both fame and fortune. Even if he sold his own Innate Treasures, he could later ask Zhen Ling for even more powerful ones."

No matter how you calculate it, he never suffered a loss.

...

Watching Wu Zuo leave, he muttered to himself, "Why did I take such a foolish disciple in the first place!"

Zhen Ling shook his head, choosing not to dwell on that.

The inheritances of the three Divine Masters, Chaos, and All Things, all had their fates decided. There was also one originally intended for Hu Qing, but since Hu Qing went to the Earth Realm, he became increasingly unreadable, leading to the abandonment of that plan.

On Jian Wushuang's side, he at least knew some details. However, with Hu Qing's timeline becoming blurred, he could no longer see clearly. Moreover, even before Fuego's resurrection, he felt a threat emanating from Hu Qing, something that seemed off.

Now, he increasingly felt the severity of that feeling, surpassing the threat Fuego posed to him.

With the success of this plan, after eliminating Fuego, he would have to rethink his approach to Hu Qing.

Eliminate him?

It was a bit regrettable, but without getting rid of Hu Qing, he wouldn't find peace for a day.

What was originally within his control now turned into a mess.

Within a small universe, unexpectedly, so many extraordinary individuals were born.

Previously, it was thought that the Original Universe created numerous powerful cultivators because it feared the True Master, willing to exhaust its own Origin Source to create such formidable practitioners.

Now, this reasoning seemed less convincing.

Ultimately, everything could be blamed on Hu Qing.

When opening the Three Kings Court, one significant benefit was to ensure Hu Qing's successful integration with the Dao.

This ensured the appearance of an Emperor who had perfected the Ultimate Dao.

But now, after cultivation, it only intensified his fear.

Instead, he had to be eliminated.

Originally, he thought he had gained, but in the end, he was the one who suffered the most.

Zhen Ling continued to contemplate, holding onto the chess pieces.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted in the land. While there was already the madman Broly, recently, a shameless supreme-peak expert appeared, specifically robbing tier 6 emperors.

Even tier 5 emperors were not spared later.

This led many forces to quickly seek refuge in the Qishen Temple, receiving its protection.

This time, Wu Zuo had unintentionally done a good deed for the temple.

The temple naturally did not care, but Wu Zuo's name and image were publicized.

This led all the emperors in the land to curse Wu Zuo for his shamelessness.

Even tier 5 emperors were not exempt.

Wu Zuo, however, paid no attention to this.

After all, he gained a lot.

At the same time, he received good news from Jian Wushuang.

Now, he had achieved a breakthrough to the 43rd level.

In the Beiwang Tower.

This time, Jian Wushuang did not easily suppress the Envoy of All Things and could only fight with all his might.

"Senior, give me a chance. I don't want to torture you forever, but I have my own difficulties!" Jian Wushuang stood there, explaining.

However, the Envoy of All Things did not listen at all. With tier 6 top-tier strength, Jian Wushuang was no match.

"Give you a chance? Have you given me a chance to speak?" the Envoy of All Things sneered.

Jian Wushuang sighed and said, "Then, I have to offend you!"
