4711 Sealing With the Array

With another finger, a Yan Immortal’s divine body and immortal source were destroyed in the same way.

Out of the 12 Yan Immortals, only 10 were left. At the same time, there were over 800 Ancestor-level cultivators left.

Seeing him kill a Yan Immortal so easily, even Jian Wushuang was shocked. One must know that even he himself could not do it so easily.

Standing in his own domain, the Young Emperor was like an unquestionable ruler. With every wave of his hand, he took away dozens of black-robed Ancestors.

The skinny purple-robed man, Cheng Qing, and the others also reacted and began to counterattack.

Jian Wushuang looked back and continued to break through the encirclement.

After being killed, there were only eight Yan Immortals left!

Finally, a black-robed Yan Immortal reacted. He took out an item from his chest pocket with great difficulty and nailed it to the ground.

It was a palm-sized flag. As the first flag fell, all the black-robed top cultivators took out the same flag and threw it.

There were nearly a hundred flags enshrouded in a strange energy. As soon as they fell into the air, they immediately linked with each other and formed a large array that directly suppressed them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The skinny purple-robed man’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to grab the flag, but he was too late.

The flag was like the eye of the formation. As soon as it landed, the vast sealing force broke the Young Emperor’s Domain in an instant and trapped him firmly like a big bell.

As if he had suffered a backlash, the Young Emperor suddenly oozed out a wisp of red divine blood, and his terrifying Yan power weakened at a rapid pace.

Chen Qing was shocked. He raised the long sword in his hand, which was surrounded by Immortal energy, and stabbed at the array.

However, the invincible blade had lost its former effect this time, and it did not even shake the array.

“Young Master!” The skinny purple-robed man rushed forward, but due to his anxiety, he immediately vomited another mouthful of divine blood.

The black-robed Yan Immortals who were gradually surrounding them stopped and looked at them with mocking expressions.

This formation was specially made for the Young Emperor. Once he was trapped, his divine body and Immortal Source would be destroyed and he would have no chance of survival.

With just him and Chen Qing, it was impossible to break this great formation that was as deep as the abyss. The thin purple-robed man’s eyes were slightly red, and he had already crazily urged his Yan power to destroy this formation without caring about anything.

As for the Young Emperor, he seemed to have anticipated his fate. He sat on the ground calmly and wiped the divine blood from the corner of his mouth. He looked at the skinny purple-robed man and chuckled, “My companion, leave now. The further the better. If Jian Wushuang is willing to take you with him, you can follow him.”

The skinny purple-robed man shook his head. He seemed to have realized something and suddenly turned back to look at Jian Wushuang, who was not far away. Then, he knelt down on one knee and said, “Please save the Young Emperor.”

Hearing this, all the Yan Immortals’ expressions changed slightly. After glancing at Jian Wushuang, they attacked again to prevent any unexpected changes!

He flew into the formation, and nearly ten terrifying forces intertwined, trying to take the Young Emperor’s life in one blow.

Sighing in his heart, Jian Wushuang finally took a step forward. A thick and unparalleled Yan power surged out and cleared the ground around him.

One of the black-robed Ancestors wanted to step forward to stop them, but to their surprise, they found that they could not even take a single step forward!

Chun Qiu followed behind him, controlling the eight-armed Arhat to block some of the attacks.

A magnificent river completely constructed by Sword Intent swept forward with Jian Wushuang’s finger, like a Reverse Heavenly River!

Chen Qing’s eyes widened to their maximum. He had also entered the Dao with the sword, so how could he not understand how terrifying this ocean-like Sword Dao was!

Even if he had cultivated the way of the sword to a point where even Yan Immortal could not catch up, after seeing this magnificent Sword Intent, he knew directly and clearly that there was no way to stop it.

Who was this mysterious young man?

Everything seemed to have frozen. The eight Yan Immortals were still in mid-air, and only the Sword Dao was rushing forward.

The sealing array formed by hundreds of flags only existed for an instant under the impact of this vast river of Sword Intents before it shattered.

The terrifying Yan power that was supposed to be aimed at the Young Emperor was also destroyed in the river.

The divine bodies of those who were close to the Sword Dao were cut in half!

“Whoever takes another step forward will die,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently, but he did not look at the Yan Immortals from the beginning to the end, as if they were insignificant to him.

The formation was broken. The Young Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled.

The skinny purple-robed man, Cheng Qing, and the others immediately stood by his side to protect him.

Jian Wushuang looked at him indifferently and then turned his head slightly, “Let’s go.”

The eight Yan Immortals surrounded him. The oldest Yan Immortal in a black robe stepped forward and gritted his teeth. “You are not his subordinate. Do you know that letting him go means you are making an enemy out of us?”

Jian Wushuang glanced at him and said calmly, “Nothing more, nothing less. If you leave now, I’ll let you go. If you insist on stopping me, you can all stay here forever.”

As soon as he said that, all the top cultivators in black robes were stunned. Then, they looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange expression.

This young man, who was dressed like a Ranger and had no identity or cultivation base, although his control of Yan power was extremely terrifying, he was not invincible. In the face of nearly a thousand black-robed top cultivators, not only was he not afraid, but he was also arrogant?

Did he really have the ability or a trump card, or was he just acting out of courage?

The group of Yan Immortals was the first to react. The older man in the lead sneered, “It’s not us who should stay, it’s you!”

With that, a majestic Yan power light pillar poured out and went straight to Jian Wushuang’s face.

Without even looking at him, Jian Wushuang struck his palm to the side and a wave of Yan power with a strong killing intent attacked him.

The sinister smile of victory was still on his face, but in the next moment, that elderly Yan Immortal was sent flying.

This attack was enough to make even Whirling Patriarch, who had surpassed the Yan Immortal stage, be on guard. It was clearly enough to make this Yan Immortal elder suffer.

Jian Wushuang, who had completely let go, was now free of the burden in his heart. He walked calmly in the encirclement as if he had entered a no-man’s land.

If he really could not deal with it, he could simply summon the True Shadows of the three Emperors and wipe out the place.

If the Young Emperor pursued the matter in the later stages, he might not even find much.

“Don’t dawdle. You guys leave first. I’ll cover you,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

The skinny purple-robed man solemnly thanked him and then led the way with Cheng Qing and the others!

The Young Emperor looked back at Jian Wushuang and said, “Thank you. I owe you one.”

“Let’s save our lives first,” Jian Wushuang said. He still did not show any expression.
