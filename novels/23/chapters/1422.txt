Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The news about Jian Wushuang returning to Lineage of Star stirred a commotion in Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang had suddenly came across a thunder test during the battle.

Many disciples made guesses that Jian Wushuang should be going through his God’s Test in the Third Heaven.

Then, when Jian Wushuang had returned to Lineage of Star, his aura obviously went through a drastic change.

Because of the treasure that the founder of Lineage of Star had bestowed on him, Jian Wushuang was obviously giving out an aura of a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

Hence, the news of Jian Wushuang had passed through God’s Test in the Third Heaven and the news that he had become a Universe God in the Third Heaven spread across the entire Lineage of Star like wildfire.

There weren’t many Universe God in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star. Universe God in the Third Heaven who were disciples of Star Palace were even rarer.

…

Jian Wushuang passed through the buildings and arrived before a golden palace with an imposing aura.

At the entrance of the golden palace, there was an engraving of a Real God Pavilion.

“Real God Pavilion.”

Looking at the golden palace with its imposing aura, Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his mouth and walked forward.

There was a white-haired elderly who sat at the entrance of the golden palace. The white-haired elderly had his eyes closed like an old monk in meditation.

“Elderly.”

Jian Wushuang bowed slightly at the white-haired elderly.

The white-haired elderly slowly opened his eyes and took a glance at Jian Wushuang with his murky eyes, “Jian Wushuang?”

The white-haired elderly had gone to watch the battle previously and he had seen Jian Wushuang’s magnificent performance.

“Oh, you became a Universe God in the Third Heaven?” The white-haired elderly fixed his gaze on him.

“Elderly, I’d like to go into Real God Hall,” Jian Wushuang said straightforwardly.

“You are a Universe God in the Third Heaven and also a disciple of Star Palace, you are qualified to enter. However, I have to remind you that it isn’t easy to open the Real God Hall every time. The price to pay is terrifyingly high too. Even a disciple of Star Palace only has one chance to enter for free. To enter for a second time, one would be required to complete a training task and receive an additional grant,” the white-haired elderly said.

“I see?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. He never knew about this before.

“You can give further thought as to whether you want to enter now,” the white-haired elderly said with a smile as he waited for Jian Wushuang’s answer.

Jian Wushuang hesitated for a short while before he came to a conclusion.

“My ultimate disciple task will come in another hundred years. Once I have completed my ultimate disciple task, I will receive an additional grant. By then, I will have a chance to enter the Real God Pavilion again,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Elderly, I shall enter now.”

“Alright, I will open it for you. You can enter directly. Remember, you can only stay in Real God Hall for one month during each visit. In that month, you should appreciate your time and not waste the opportunity,” the white-haired elderly exhorted.

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. After the white-haired elderly opened the door to enter Real God Hall, he took a huge stride into Real God Hall.

It was a vast starry sky.

Jian Wushuang stood right in the middle of the starry sky and looked around suspiciously.

“Real God Hall, the most precious land of opportunities on Lineage of Star. What kind of opportunities are there here?”

Jian Wushuang was curious.

Just then… Wah! There was a huge, tempestuous river that appeared at the end of the starry sky, and it was soaring towards him at a terrifying speed.

The river flowed so swiftly that Jian Wushuang didn’t manage to respond in time but was swallowed entirely.

In the depths of the river, Jian Wushuang couldn’t feel any impact and could only feel a unique strength from all direction.

“This… this is…?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He could tell that the huge river was formed by these unique strengths.

The unique strengths, Jian Wushuang couldn’t determine what they were.

“Such incredible strength.”

Jian Wushuang extended his hand and touched the river water that was formed by the unique strengths.

He couldn’t see or touch the strengths, he could only feel them.

“These strengths, some I am familiar with but most of them are very new to me. What are they?” Jian Wushuang creased their eyebrows.

Just then, King of Venomous Worms suddenly spoke, “Jian Wushuang, the strength that you can feel now is the purest and also the strongest power in Eternal Chaotic World. Its births and heaven ways exist in the cycle of heaven ways. It is… Power of Heaven Way!”

“Heaven Way?” Jian Wushuang stared.

“Heaven Way is the beginning of all living things in the universe. Eternal Chaotic World that we are in, the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, to the next Eternal World or even Aeons World, they are all nurtured by Heaven Way. The cycle of Heaven Way was formed by thirteen types of strengths in total!” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“These Power of Heaven Way are shrouded in mystery. They are extremely fierce. Many cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World are dying to get the fierce Power of Heaven Way.”

“Hence, there are cultivators who have tried to comprehend the Power of Heaven Way, which then derived the process of the Four Supreme Doctrine, Nine Divine God Doctrine.”

“The cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World, through comprehension of the Four Supreme Doctrine, Nine Divine God Doctrine, with the aid of Power of Heaven Way, could release even stronger and more impressive power. However, because the Power of Heaven Way is too mysterious, only experts above the level of Real God are qualified to comprehend under normal circumstance. As for Universe God…”

“Any ordinary Universe God isn’t qualified to comprehend such strength. Only some true geniuses or incredible existences could try to comprehend one of the doctrines after they become Universe God in the Third Heaven. It is extremely rare. I reckon that there shouldn’t be many in the entire Eternal Chaotic World.”

“Jian Wushuang, do you still remember the genius, Duan Lingfeng, that you met on Ancient Star Sea back then? I told you that you met the real genius then. The reason why I said so was that I could tell that he already understood Massacre Doctrine in the Nine Heaven God Doctrine!”

“Duan Lingfeng?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but think of the genius that he was friends with in Ancient Star Sea.

Back then, King of Venomous Worms had said that Duan Lingfeng took the step.

Jian Wushuang didn’t understand the ‘step’ that King of Venomous Worms was talking about. But, then, he understood. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It turned out that Duan Lingfeng was a super genius who comprehended the Power of Heaven Way when he was just a Universe God.

“Back when we saw Duan Lingfeng, he had just passed his God’s Test in the Third Heaven. But his comprehension of Massacre Doctrine was extremely high. In other words, he had already understood a slight bit of massacre doctrine when he was a Universe God in the Second Heaven. A genius like him was hard to find, even in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries,” King of Venomous Worms continued.
