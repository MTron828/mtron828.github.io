Chapter 491: Finally Unbearable

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

The 18 foot tall Golden Sword Soul Phantom was like a matchless fiend beneath the heavens. As Jian Wushuang began marching forward, this Golden Sword Soul Phantom also suddenly stepped forward and swung its longsword. Power instantly erupted from the Sword Soul and fought with Marquis Zizhong head-on.

Then, the boundless Blood River gushed out toward Marquis Zizhong to restrain him.

Previously, Jian Wushuang almost had to use his full strength to seriously injure Marquis Nanyu while he was using a normal sword, but the battle strength of Marquis Zizhong was obviously superior to that of Marquis Nanyu. With the power of the Dao Weapon in hand, Marquis Zizhong and Jian Wushuang were evenly matched in one-on-one close combat, both in speed and skill.

But now Marquis Zizhong could only grapple with Jian Wushuang. As for what he said earlier about slaying Jian Wushuang, it was obviously impossible. In this regard, Marquis Zizhong was helplessly reaching his limit.

“His Excellency, Su Ming wanted me to slay Jian Wushuang and bring back the Heart-killing Sword, but who would have thought that this boy was only in the Saint Realm. How is his battle strength this incredible?”?Marquis Zizhong thought, from the bottom of his heart.

Before Jian Wushuang and Marquis Nanyu’s one-on-one fight, Marquis Zizhong also thought he knew what the outcome would be, but after seeing Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship severely injure Marquis Nanyu, he knew that he would not be able to kill Jian Wushuang alone.

“We can only wait for His Excellency, Su Ming, to handle this.”

Marquis Zizhong seemed to have intentionally or unintentionally been searching the surrounding area.

He knew that His Excellency, Su Ming, must be hiding somewhere close, but he just hadn’t appeared. It was because of this that he knew he couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang. Yet, he was fighting like crazy with Jian Wushuang, trying to kill him.

He just wanted Su Ming to see that he had tried his best, and that the opponent was too strong for him to kill.

On the battlefield, the fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Marquis Zizhong had reached the white-hot stage. The two men were colliding head-on and turning into residual shadows from time to time, then chasing and dodging each other at an alarming speed within the battlefield. But no matter how hard they fought, it was difficult to tell who would win or lose.

“Marquis Zizhong is worthy of the title “Marquis”. I’m afraid that even 10 ‘Marquis Nanyus’ combined couldn’t be compared to him,”?thought Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang, who was in the middle of the fight, suddenly looked at Marquis Zizhong and said, “Your strength demands that I use the Heart-killing Sword .”

Jian Wushuang’s voice instantly lowered and his wrist moved. The Triple-kill Sword disappeared, replaced by a wicked longsword that exuded an unusually bloodthirsty sensation.

“This is the first time I?have used this sword. I wonder how powerful it is?”?Jian Wushuang thought and then smirked. However, this smirk caused the facial expression of Marquis Zizhong to change greatly.

“Damn it!”

When Marquis Zizhong saw the wicked longsword in Jian Wushuang’s hand, his pupils suddenly contracted. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The Heart-killing Sword was the number one killing sword in the vast Divine Land. Marquis Zizhong didn’t know how powerful it was. He only knew that Jian Wushuang fought to a draw with him while using the Triple-kill Sword, which was merely a first-grade magic weapon. Now, if he used the Heart-killing Sword...

“After all, the Heart-killing Sword is the best weapon for someone who practices Sword Principle. With Jian Wushuang’s strength, he only needs to show a little bit of its power and he will be able to completely suppress me,”?Marquis Zizhong thought fearfully.

When he saw Jian Wushuang preparing to use the Heart-killing Sword, a sense of unrest began to grow in Marquis Zizhong’s heart.

However, even though he wanted to leave, he was already being suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s Blood River Realm, which prevented him from leaving without Jian Wushuang’s permission.

Jian Wushuang’s residual shadow gradually disappeared from where he had just been, and a vibrating Ghost-like figure instantly moved through the Blood River, appearing in front of Marquis Zizhong. A sword slash immediately swept out, accompanied by a slicing sound.

This sword, carrying a decisive and unwavering intent, was the second move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Desperation!

As if acknowledging Jian Wushuang as its master, the Heart-killing Sword shook crazily at that moment and exploded with power that soared to the heavens. Jian Wushuan’s attack seemed to have reached the pinnacle of terror.

Perhaps another person could display similar swordsmanship, but Jian Wushuang had performed a secret technique of the Heart-killing Sword, Desperation! If it was compared to the power released when he used the Triple-kill Sword, this time the technique was several times more powerful.

“I can’t stop this sword strike!”

Seeing this attack in action, and feeling the immense power it emanated, Marquis Zizhong wore a terrified look on his face.

However, the sword did not land on Marquis Zizhong’s body. Instead, it struck the space in front of him. The empty space was torn apart, and a white-robed human figure immediately emerged from it.

As soon as the white-robed man appeared, he countered with a strong Sword Essence.

This Sword Essence, with just its first counterattack, pushed almost everything back towards Jian Wushuang, causing Jian Wushuang to become unsettled and the sword in his hand to become still.

After regaining his stance and composure, Jian Wushuang squinted to get a better look at this newcomer.

The large number of Sword Principle experts in the area, who were watching the fight, all focused their attention on the white-robed man who suddenly appeared.

“Has he really come?”?They wondered.

None of the Sword Principle experts were surprised by the unexpected appearance of the white-robed man.

Everyone knew that he would never give up on the Heart-killing Sword so easily.

Jian Wushuang also gazed at the newcomer. The corners of the white-robed man’s mouth were smeared with a peculiar curve-like paint, “It’s finally unbearable!” Spoke the white-robed man.

The white-robed man, with a handsome demon-like face, was one of the Nine Sovereigns in the vast Divine Land and also the owner of Sword-suppression Valley… Sword Demon, Su Ming!

Su Ming had suppressed the Heart-killing Sword in Sword-suppression Valley for thousands of years. He already regarded the Heart-killing Sword as his own. At the Sword Principle Meeting in Sword-suppression Valley, the Heart-killing Sword had been acknowledged as one of the most powerful weapons. Would Su Ming willingly let it go?

While they were inside the Sword-suppression Valley, Su Ming was afraid of losing his prestige and reputation since it was inappropriate for him to handle this matter in the presence of guests.

Even outside of the Sword-suppression Valley, Su Ming allowed Marquis Zizhong to try settling matters first while he stayed in the dark. He still could not come forward, so he naturally did not come forward. But when he realized Marquis Zizhong also could not deal with Jian Wushuang, he had no alternative but to do it himself.

“His Excellency, Su Ming...” said Marquis Zizhong while bowing respectfully “...I have tried my best,” Marquis Zizhong finished what he wanted to say.

“I noticed,” Su Ming answered, then he nodded and gestured a dismissive wave towards Marquis Zizhong.

It was appropriate for Marquis Zizhong to step aside, he knew that the arrival of Su Ming meant he was no longer needed.

Su Ming still possessed his arrogant posture while looking at Jian Wushuang who stood directly in front of him. When he saw the Heart-killing Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand, his pupils secretly narrowed in on it. He immediately revealed a cold smile. “The sword is good, but the one who is using it is too weak,” remarked Su Ming.

“Ha ha! Your Excellency, Su Ming is right. I am weak. I cannot even use ten percent of the Heart-killing Sword’s power. However, it doesn’t matter how much of its power I can use, because I’m still better off than the people who don’t even have enough ability to be recognized by the Heart-killing Sword. All they can do is look on in despair, right?” Jian Wushuang responded while smiling.
