Chapter 1014: A Move?

In a hall in the deepest part of the territory of the Rock Demon Clan.

“Third Elder, how is the preparation going?” God Hong asked, sitting on a throne. He looked very pale, and his eyes were bloodshot.

The elder experts of the Rock Demon Clan were gathering at the bottom of the hall.

“One hundred talented young clansmen have assembled. They can set off at any moment.” The third Elder of the Rock Demon Clan, the only Dao Master expert in the hall besides God Hong, said with a trace of misery.

The Rock Demon Clan ran into an unprecedented crisis. Except for God Hong and him, the other Dao Masters were struggling to resist the attack of the Black Python Clan. Meanwhile, they gathered in the hall, trying to leave a batch of descendants for the Rock Demon Clan.

“God Hong, our Rock Demon Clan was really in such a plight?” An old lady with a dragon staff in hand asked in a deep voice.

With a shudder of his huge body, God Hong said seriously, “We are trapped by the Black Python Clan and suffered a great loss of the high-level battle strength. Even I’m seriously injured. There is less than thirty percent of our battle strength left. What’s worse, the Black Python Clan has called in a Dao Master expert at the Peak level of Rank Three to help them…”

“Although the overall strength of our clan is almost equal to that of the Black Python Clan, we are unable to resist them with the huge gap between the battle strength of our high-level leaders and that of theirs. It’s impossible that the Black Python Clan will spare our clan. We are almost doomed.”

God Hong gripped his hands tightly and said while trembling physically and mentally.

Doomed!

It was such a simple word, but enough to drive the Rock Demon Clan mad.

God Hong raised his head again, and his eyes reddened. He said, “Our Rock Demon Clan can be destructed and completely vanish in Samsara Continent. Nevertheless, the bloodline of our Rock Demon Clan that has been passed on for long years can’t be cut off today!”

“Third Elder, later other Elders and I will think of a way to distract those experts of the Black Python Clan. Then you should seek an opportunity to lead the one hundred talented young clansmen to leave this territory. From now on, all of you should conceal your identities and never revealed you’re from the Rock Demon Clan to anyone!”

“Besides, later other Elders and I will fight to the death, but numerous clansmen don’t need to do so. Tell them to get away as much as possible. The more of them get away, the more descendants of our Rock Demon Clan can survive. Got it?”

God Hong’s voice reverberated around the entire hall.

In the hall, all experts of the Rock Demon Clan took death calmly with a resolute expression. Quite a few of them even looked insane!

It was the genocide battle of the Rock Demon Clan. They were high-level experts of the Rock Demon Clan. Besides Third Elder got his necessary task, the rest of them would definitely fight to the death and stay with their population.

However, just at this moment… ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Big Brother Hong, Big Brother Hong!”

With an anxious voice, someone rushed into the hall in haste. It was Qing Bin.

“What’s the matter? They failed to block the enemies?” God Hong asked, suddenly gripping his hands.

“No, it’s not about it. It’s Wushuang, Master Wushuang…” Qing Bin apparently came here in great haste, so he failed to say it clearly due to shortness of breath.

“Jian Wushuang? Didn’t I tell you to lead him away at once?” God Hong said in a deep voice.

“No, Master Wushuang didn’t leave. Instead, he joined the fight and directly killed the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan.” Qing Bin finally calmed down and said.

“What?” All the people in the hall including God Hong were dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe their ears at first.

Jian Wushuang killed the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan?

“Qing Bin, what did you just say?” God Hong repeated anxiously.

“Master Wushuang joined the fight and directly killed the eight Dao Masters who intruded the residence of our Rock Demon Clan. What’s more, Master Wushuang did it with just a move.” Qing Bin said seriously.

This time everyone heard him clearly.

But after hearing it clearly, they were panic-stricken and sick at heart.

Jian Wushuang was the young man who had been a guest in the city of the Rock Demon Clan and meditated upon the nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor in the rift during the past years.

Did he kill the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan?

What was more, he did it with just a move?

“Are you kidding me!” Third Elder was the first to exclaim.

We shouldn’t blame him. After all, it was unusual in every respect.

They were Dao Master experts, not just some cabbages on the street. They couldn’t be killed so easily.

After all, as a top expert, each Dao Master had his own trump card. They couldn’t be killed easily.

Even if all of the eight Dao Master of the Black Python Clan were the most common Rank One Dao Masters, it still needed extraordinary skill and strength to kill them with just a move. At least, no one from their Rock Demon Clan possessed this strength.

Furthermore, the Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan were generally at a high level. Among the eight Dao Masters who had been killed, there were five Rank Two Dao Masters and only three Rank One Dao Masters. It would be even harder to kill eight Dao Masters like them at the same time with just a move.

But now Qing Bin told them that Jian Wushuang who was just at Eternal Realm Level killed the eight Dao Masters with just a move?

Could it be possible?

“Qing Bin, are you sure that he killed them with just one strike?” God Hong asked in astonishment.

“I’m positive. Many of our clansmen witnessed that. The bodies of the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan still lie under Master Wushuang’s feet. Brother Hong, we can go there and have a look if you’d like to.” Qing Bin quickly replied.

“Let’s go there and have a look.”

Without thinking about something else, God Hong instantly rushed out of the hall and directly headed for the battlefield at the forefront. The high-level experts of the Rock Demon Clan naturally followed him.

Soon, they showed up around the battlefield and saw what was happening in front of them.

In the vast Void, more than one million clansmen of the Rock Demon Clan and the Black Python Clan gathered there. With so many people around, it should be extremely noisy. However, at this moment, they were horribly quiet in this Void.

There was total silence without any noise.

It was like the entire space and time were frozen.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the scarlet-robed man with a longsword on his back in the very center of the Void.

The scarlet-robed man had a faint smile on his face. Under his feet, there were eight bodies.

Although they were dead, they still wore terrified expressions and auras of Dao Masters.

There was an extremely clear sword scar respectively at every corpse’s neck. Both the shape and the cut of the sword scar looked exactly the same. Obviously, someone killed the eight people at the same time with just a move.

Just a move!
