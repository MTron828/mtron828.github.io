Chapter 1883: Boatman In Black

The void was filled with blurry fog. The huge, ancient silver spaceship vanished into thin air while Jian Wushuang stood arrogantly alone.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was like lightning. He stared forward with a tinge of coldness.

In the void that Jian Wushuang was staring at, there were ripples spreading in the water.

In the thick grey fog, there was a simple wooden boat.

On the boat, there was an elderly paddling.

The elderly was scrawny and tan-skinned. He was shabbily dressed in black with a bamboo hat. Judging by his looks, he was no different from an ordinary boatman.

However, after the boatman in black appeared, Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat and his face grew solemn.

The wooden boat emerged from the grey fog and continued to travel forward until it was a hundred miles away from Jian Wushuang before it stopped.

“I wonder who you are. Why do you block my route?” Jian Wushuang remained at the same spot as his voice spread.

“Hehe, I am a nobody. My name, Sword Emperor doesn’t have to bother. I came here today for only one matter…” the boatman in black smiled and said in a gentle voice.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sword Emperor, what do you think about this fish?” The boatman in black suddenly pointed in one direction of the void.

Jian Wushuang suddenly looked and realized that the void filled with ripples while in the water, there was a huge carp that weighed about three jin that jumped out. It was so vivid, as though it was real. The moment the carp jumped out, Jian Wushuang became heavily guarded.

Vroom vroom. Jian Wushuang’s consciousness was heavily affected.

As the imaged turned, Jian Wushuang came to an ordinary courtyard.

In the courtyard, there was a young maiden in snow-white blouse. She was practicing her Sword Principle while a young man sat by the side and gave pointers casually. He pointed out the young maiden’s flaw in her Sword Principle.

The courtyard wasn’t huge but it was a great place to practice swordsmanship.

Although it had been years, Jian Wushuang could determine with a glance that the courtyard was where he used to practice swordsmanship when he was young.

It was Sword Marquis Mansion!

The young maiden in the snow white blouse was Jian Menger, who had once been entangled with him.

The young man who was sitting by the side and giving pointers was him in his younger times!

The familiar sight was replayed perfectly.

“Sword Marquis Mansion, Jian Menger… it has been a while,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly turned sharp.

“Only dreamland, how could it affect me?”

Jian Wushuang thought and he instantly plunged towards his true will with unprecedented determination.

The image of younger times that he had missed immediately shattered with shockingly fast speed.

Finally, the image shattered completely. Jian Wushuang continued to stand arrogantly into the void that was filled with grey fog while the wooden boat in front of him remained at the same spot. However, the boatman in black who was originally on the wooden boat disappeared.

Psst!

Extremely soft. If it was any other ordinary Almighty, he wouldn’t be able to hear the sound but there was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Go!”

A low roar and Blood Mountain Sword was out of its scabbard.

Jian Wushuan wielded his sword and brought about boundless sword intention. Simultaneously, it shook off the spacetime. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The stroke was Spacetime Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang created through the combination of his studies about Spacetime Doctrine and Sword Principle.

In Spacetime Sword Principle, Jian Wushuang had already created the seventh move and he was merely performing until the fifth move.

Dang!

Along with a loud clash, the boatman in black’s figure few backward.

There was murderous intention soaring from Jian Wushuang’s body. With his willpower, the four Hong Jun Golden Swords ascended and turned into four rays of resplendent golden light. They chased after the boatman in black at lightning speed.

“Hehe,” the boatman in black smiled maliciously. As he retreated, his figure instantly blended into the surrounding grey fog and vanished.

Jian Wushuang grew distressed while the four Hong Jun Golden Swords immediately stopped.

He glanced around and swept out his soul power over the widest range. However, his soul power couldn’t see through the surrounding grew fog.

He knew that that boatman in black should be around but he couldn’t determine the boatman in black’s exact location.

“King of Venomous Worms, would your secret skill be able to locate him?” Jian Wushuang asked.

His current power had already reached the top of Emperor God level. Although King of Venomous Worms had already transformed into Full-Foot Plenilune, his scariest power was actually recovery power. In ferocious fights, it was difficult for him to assist Jian Wushuang. However, he had many auxiliary skills.

For example, King of Venomous Worms knew a secret skill whereby whenever someone got close to Jian Wushuang, King of Venomous Worms would instantly be alerted and he would remind Jian Wushuang.

King of Venomous Worms shook his head when he heard Jian Wushuang, “I can’t. Maybe due to the surrounding grey fog, my secret skill wasn’t working when I performed it.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze fixed.

He could tell that his opponent was well-prepared. For instance, the surrounding thick grey fog should be a formation.

“Who are you exactly?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold as it spread in the surrounding void.

Ever since he had started cultivating, he had offended countless enemies. There were quite a number of them who wanted him dead.

However, his power was on display. There shouldn’t be many who had the guts to scheme against him.

However, the boatman in black that he had come across… He had never heard of him, nor seen him before, but he posed a great threat.

One should know that the magic skill earlier… In Jian Wushuang’s view, it was definitely the most realistic and scariest magic skill.

If it wasn’t because he was an inverse cultivator and his mental state had been in training to the point that he had already reached the peak of the third level of mental state, he wouldn’t be able to shake off that dreamland forcefully.

Plus, the boatman in black’s assassination skill was really scary.

He could say that the boatman in black was definitely one of the strongest assassins he had seen so far.

“Hehe, Sword Emperor, I said that I only have one purpose for this trip. The purpose is naturally to kill you!”

His gentle voice spread from all directions and Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure in which direction the voice came from.

Nor did he know the location of the boatman in black.

Just then… Vroom!

A strange bolt of power charged to Jian Wushuang without any signs before.

“Soul attack?”

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.
