Chapter 3533: Was Born

The other eight experts were divided into four camps.

Jian Wushuang first looked at the burly man who had put a lot of pressure on them.

The burly man was wearing red armor and carrying a huge axe on his back. He stood there with his arms folded like a statue, but he did not bother to look at anyone around him.

“He is the Eight Axe Master, right?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

The Eight Axe Master was a solitary expert who had been wandering around Devil Smoke Valley all year round. He was extremely powerful and had reached the peak of the fifth void realm. Moreover, his axe skills were extremely violent and he had created a sixth-level absolute art.

He was only one person, but the pressure he brought was much stronger than the other camps.

Therefore, there was no other expert who had reached the peak of the fifth void realm.

Among the other three camps, one had two experts of the fifth void realm working together, one had one expert of the fifth void realm and one expert of the peak of the fourth void realm. The remaining three experts of the fourth void realm were all in the same camp, including Jian Wushuang and the others, there were a total of 12 experts present.

“Fortunately, the strongest among these people is only the expert of the peak of the fifth void realm, Eight Axe Master. There are no experts of the sixth void realm here. If the four of us work together, we can still have a chance,” the Heavy Master said.

“This is the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley after all. It’s already good enough to have experts of the peak of the fifth void realm. As for experts of the sixth void realm...almost all of them have gone to the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. Who would come to this outer area?” The Saber Python Master said.

“You don’t say. Not long ago, we ran into one. It was the infamous God Fei Master,” Heavy Master said.

“What? God Fei Master came to this outer region?” Saber Python Master was shocked.

“That is indeed the case. Heavy Master and I were pursued by him. Fortunately, Blood Sword Master helped us to get out of the situation. Moreover, the place where he was pursuing us was nearby. We don’t know if the appearance of this broken Poluo God part will attract him here,” Purple Sound Master said.

“It shouldn’t be.” Heavy Master shook his head. “Has the appearance of this Poluo God component caused too much of a commotion? The only ones who can discover it are the experts who just happened to pass by the Black Thunder Earth Pool. After these experts discover it, they will at most pass on the news to their own forces, but they will definitely not make this matter completely public. After all, they also want to snatch this Poluo God component. Naturally, they do not want too many people to know that this Poluo God component was born here.”

“As for that God Fei Master...although it is true that he is extremely powerful, he is an expert who travels alone. Who would tell him the news of the appearance of the Poluo God parts here?

“As long as he doesn’t happen to pass by this Black Thunder Pool, then he won’t be able to participate in this battle.”

“Mm, that makes sense.” Purple Sound Master and Saber Python Master both nodded.

At this moment, in the void beneath their feet, Poluo God trembled slightly. He was about to break free from the Black Thunder Pool.

“Poluo God’s component is about to be born.” Saber Python Master’s eyes lit up.

“Everyone, be prepared to fight for it at any time,” Heavy Master said.

“Once something happens to Poluo God’s component, I’ll immediately use my spacetime domain to suppress them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“With your space-time domain, Blood Sword Master, their speed will be greatly restricted. This will increase our chances,” Heavy Master said.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang did not want to expose his name, so Heavy Master now called Jian Wushuang Blood Sword Master.

Buzz!

With a shrill cry, the Poluo God component, which was trapped in the Thunder Pool, finally broke free from the Thunder Pool.

The aura of a universe true treasure instantly spread out.

“It’s born!”

The eyes of the twelve Great Beings who had been waiting around all lit up.

“Attack!”

“Snatch it!”

In an instant, each great being emitted a terrifying aura as they directly rushed toward the Poluo God part.

Eight Axe Master, who was standing alone in the void realm like a statue, had already taken out his huge axe. In an instant, he turned into an ancient fierce beast and dashed out.

The two experts of the five void realms who were standing together also rushed out at the same time.

As for Jian Wushuang and the other three, Saber Python Master, Heavy Master, and Purple Sound Master all rushed out at once. Jian Wushuang was the only one who did not rush out. Instead, he took out the golden sky-painting banner and used the spacetime domain.

Buzz! The enormous spacetime domain covered the area around the Poluo God component. In addition to Saber Python Master, Heavy Master, and Purple Sound Master, the other experts in the area were also affected, they were all slowed down by the enormous speed.

“A domain type true treasure?”

“No, this feeling should be a space-time true treasure.”

The Great Beings who were trapped in the space-time domain had a change of expression.

However, at this moment, without any warning, a large amount of golden light suddenly shone.

With Eight Axe Master as the core, the crimson-gold flowing light surged like a raging ocean. In the next moment, it filled the entire battlefield.

Within the crimson-gold flowing light, Eight Axe Master seemed to have become the ruler. Even Jian Wushuang’s space-time domain was greatly impacted by the crimson-gold flowing light.

“A domain type true treasure. This is a domain type universe true treasure!”

“It’s Eight Axe Master!”

“Damn it! We’re both trapped in the space-time domain at the same time, so we’re much slower than the golden light. But Eight Axe Master used the golden light to block the space-time domain, so his speed isn’t affected at all!”

“Quick! Block Eight Axe Master!”

The Great Beings who were eager to get the Poluo God parts started to get anxious.

Eight Axe Master was originally the strongest among them, and his speed was also the fastest.

Now that Eight Axe Master’s speed was not being suppressed, he could be the first to appear in front of the Poluo god parts and take them away. Once the Poluo God parts fell into Eight Axe Master’s hands…if they wanted to fight for them again, there would be no chance at all.

After all, if they wanted to fight for the treasure from Eight Axe Master, they would definitely have to think of a way to kill Eight Axe Master. But who here had the strength to do so?

Even if everyone joined hands, they probably would not be able to do anything to Eight Axe Master, right?

Thus, everyone understood that they absolutely could not let the Poluo God component fall into Eight Axe Master’s hands.

Immediately, the Principles Masters who were still some distance away from the Poluo God component all made their moves. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

All of them made their moves almost at the same time. Even though they were some distance away, the Eight Axe Masters did not dare to ignore their attacks.
