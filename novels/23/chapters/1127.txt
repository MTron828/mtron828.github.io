“Celestial Master Yi, Celestial Master Meng Long.” Jian Wushuang smiled and greeted them. “Well, where is Celestial Master Jin Qu?”

“Jin Qu… died.” Celestial Master Yi sighed.

Jian Wushuang froze but soon shook his head.

He had even nearly been killed by Heaven Shadow King in that fierce battle, therefore, as a medium Celestial Master, Jin Qu was very likely to die.

“Dan Xin that old bastard is clearly making fun of us.” Celestial Master Yi swore in a low voice.

“All right, stop complaining.” Celestial Master Meng Long glanced at Celestial Master Yi and then asked, “Jian Wushuang, will you mine the Black Iron?”

“No.” Jian Wushuang directly shook his head. “What about you?”

“Celestial Master Meng Long and I plan to take our chance. It’s no big deal but merely to mine five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron and it’s nothing serious even if the Dan Xin Palace doesn’t recognize one of us as its master after that. But once we succeed in doing that, it will be beneficial to both us and the Green Fire Palace.” Celestial Master Yi said.

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows and nodded.

Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long quickly set off.

Apart from them, the better part of the other Celestial Masters from the Green Fire Palace chose to mine the Black Iron. Only a few people were unwilling to contend for that.

Jian Wushuang was one of them.

Of course, instead of cherishing his dignity, he did do that because he was not interested in the Dan Xin Palace.

“Be it the Life Elixirs or the Nirvana Elixirs, they don’t do me much good. I fought for them for the sake of the Green Fire Palace. I have had enough Life Elixirs and even three Nirvana Elixirs, so I have done my best for the Green Fire Palace. As for making the Dan Xin Palace recognize me as its master…”?Jian Wushuang glanced at the Dan Xin Palace that was still located in the Restriction and shook his head.

He was well aware that Dan Xin would never allow others to become the master of the Dan Xin Palace so easily.

And even if it finally had a master, that would never be him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Since the Dan Xin Palace is a place to store elixirs, his master must be the one who has gained great attainments on refining elixirs or can recognize all the elixirs. Jian Wushuang, you don’t know anything about refining elixirs and the categories of elixirs. It’s impossible for the Dan Xin Palace to recognize you as its master.” This was what Gu King said to him.

Jian Wushuang also knew this, so he had no intention to get himself involved in the following dealings.

Ignored the present experts, Jian Wushuang walked to Sunrise Sword Emperor.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor.” Jian Wushuang saluted.

“Oh, Jian Wushuang?” Sunrise Sword Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang. Although he still looked deadpan, there was a hint of kindness in his eyes.

“Thank you for saving me just now, Sword Emperor.” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You are a member of my Green Fire Palace and you were risking for the Green Fire Palace. Since I arrived here, I was obliged to save you. Any other Palace Masters will rescue you without hesitation.” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

Although Sunrise Sword Emperor said so, Jian Wushuang still appreciated him a lot.

After all, without him, his World Body would have been exterminated. Even though he would not die, the treasures on him might be seized by others. Furthermore, some of his secrets would be exposed.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor, these are three Nirvana Elixirs and all the Life Elixirs I have just acquired.” Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring and handed it to Sunrise Sword Emperor.

As soon as Sunrise Sword Emperor glanced over that, he looked quite surprised. ” Why don’t you leave one Nirvana Elixir for yourself? It will be of great use for you in the future.”

Jian Wushuang obtained the three Nirvana Elixirs through a near escape and he himself needed them too. No one would have any objection if he wanted to keep one.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I’m not even a Dao Master currently and there’s still a long way to go if I want to reach that stage. Therefore, this elixir doesn’t do much good to me. It would be better to give them to other experts in the Green Fire Palace. Perhaps this will enable the Green Fire Palace to possess one more Palace Master.”

Sunrise Sword Emperor raised his eyebrows and looked at those Life Elixirs. “29 Life Elixirs? It’s quite a lot!”

Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly.

He did obtain quite a few Life Elixirs.

He had ventured this area for 17 years and attained 11 Life Elixirs. Moreover, he killed nearly 20 Celestial Masters from the Jin Kingdom in the fierce battle just now and obtained quite a few Life Elixirs as well. Thus, he had 29 Life Elixirs in total!

“You don’t have to give these Life Elixirs to me. When you return to the Green Fire Palace, exchange them for Fire Points directly in the Fire Point Exchange Office.” Sunrise Sword Emperor smiled.

“I exchange them in the Fire Point Exchange Office?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

Void Temple Master had announced that a Life Elixir could exchange for 10,000 Fire Points.

29 Life Elixirs naturally could exchange for 290,000 Fire Points. This was definitely an astronomical figure.

“Jian Wushuang, if you don’t have anything important to do on this battlefield, why don’t you return to the Green Fire Palace as soon as possible?” Sunrise Sword Emperor suddenly said.

“Return to the Green Fire Palace as soon as possible? Why?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You should know that our palace has controlled many places of opportunities on this battlefield. The most important ones should be the three Secret Lands. Among them, the Sword World will open again before long.” Sunrise Sword Emperor explained.

“The Sword World is about to open?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

The most important one among the three Secret Lands was the Space-time Secret Land. It only opened every million years. The second important one was the Sword World.

The Sword World only opened every hundred thousand years. Jian Wushuang was very curious about it when he heard about it for the first time. He didn’t expect he would be able to enter the Sword World in a short period, but now…

“You have performed exceptionally meritorious services for our Green Fire Palace by acquiring three Nirvana Elixirs, 29 Life Elixirs, and killing so many experts from the Jin Kingdom. Our palace always put the shoe on the right foot. We cannot offer you treasures whose value matches that of the three Nirvana Elixirs, so after I return to the Green Fire Palace, I will discuss with other Palace Masters about offering you the opportunity to enter the Sword World!”

“The Sword World means a great opportunity for Warriors who major in Sword Principles. I’ve been there before, and I have gained a lot. Your talent on Sword Principles is even better than mine and I believe you can obtain more benefits.” Sunrise Sword Emperor smiled.
