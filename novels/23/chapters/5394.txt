Originally following the changes to become a personal guard, hoping to get close to the eldest prince, Jian Wushuang never saw him once from beginning to end. Later, upon slight inquiry, he found out that the eldest prince had gone to the western front.

He also changed his identity and arrived at the Western Sea.

This was the border of Tiannan, no longer belonging to Tiannan in the vast sea area.

Now, Jian Wushuang, transformed into a Dao Lord on a journey across the sea, sat on a massive treasure ship, sailing alongside tens of thousands of Dao Lords and some Emperors.

They slaughtered sea monsters, extracting origin sources.

This practice was quite popular in this region, and a single trip across the sea could yield tens of thousands of godstones.

And that was just for Dao Lords, tier 3 Emperors could gain hundreds of thousands in one voyage.

Jian Wushuang shook his head; no wonder many Emperors came from elsewhere, while Dao Lords were all from local sects.

He traveled far into the Western Sea, already beyond the borders of the MO Luo Kingdom.

Here, there were no nations, just some tribes and sects governing, relatively stable.

However, given the expansion speed of the MO Luo Kingdom, it wouldn’t be long before this place would be engulfed in the flames of war. Jian Wushuang arrived on the deck, feeling the sea breeze.

His gaze was somewhat vacant.

He still had a clone that entered the black hole, continuously shuttling through it. It had been countless years by now.

The colorful space kept changing, and he could sense that the distance from his main body was no longer within the scope of a universe.

It was truly too distant. Initially, he only intended to take a look inside, but he didn’t expect the black hole to carry him so far.

The immense energy from the black hole made it impossible for him to control his physical body.

Even though his consciousness had reached deep inside, his body was still slowly flying.

The two had separated.

This black hole was somewhat different from what he had imagined. From the outside, it didn’t appear very large. According to his understanding, some mature black holes were as big as entire worlds.

The black hole he entered was clearly not mature, but its interior surpassed his cognition.

“Interesting. Since it’s just a clone, I might as well see where the source is!”

Jian Wushuangs clone continued forward, while the main body floated in the midst of the boundless sea.

Western Sea.

It is a special place in the Earth Realm.

Within the Earth Vein, only the north, south, and central regions are suitable for survival.

Few cultivators venture into the Western Sea, as it serves as the territory of sea monsters. Typically, they only hunt sea monsters on the outskirts and rarely enter the inner Western Sea.

Jian Wushuang came here not only to search for the Crown Prince of the MO Luo Kingdom but also to slay sea monsters to refine the origin source for Bai Junwang.

Originally planning to sit back and reap the benefits between Great Xia and MO Luo, he now found himself transformed into a destitute Dao Lord.

Indeed, plans couldn’t keep up with changes.

Initially, the situation was favorable; regardless of the outcome between the two sides, he would gain something.

If he lost, he could simply give up the Beast God Weapon components and find another opportunity later.

At least, he could freely kill and assist Bai Junwang in refining the origin source during the war.

Now, things were different. He was massacring unilaterally, unable to escape, let alone conduct blood sacrifices.

Of course, winning would be the best outcome. He could not only perform a blood sacrifice but also obtain components for the Beast Gods weapon.

By helping Bai Junwang reach his peak and parting ways, he could also seek refuge with the old man with goat horns, making the entire Great Xia his own. He could utilize the resources of the entire Great Xia to aid his cultivation.

Directly stacking the divine body to fifty thousand times was not a problem, refining the Heavenly Demon Art to its peak, and then advancing both the Extreme Dao and Sword Dao, allowing him to quickly reach perfection.

That’s the advantage of having resources.

However, things took a turn for the worse. He gained nothing and attracted trouble.

He had no choice but to flee to the Western Sea.

Relying on slaying sea monsters to obtain Origin Source for Bai Junwangs blood sacrifice.

The swaying ship moved swiftly.

To enter the sea, one had to travel by boat, and flying alone required the strength of a Peak Fourth-Rank Emperor. Although this was just the outer sea with few powerful demonic beasts, there were still some Fourth-Rank Emperor-level demonic beasts lurking around, posing a great danger.

Jian Wushuangs current strength was more than enough to deal with those demonic beasts, but to maintain a low profile and conceal his identity, he chose to take the boat.

He had spent a considerable amount of godstones for this.

“Brother Jian Yi!” On the deck, a slender Daoist, seeing Jian Wushuang standing alone, revealed a smile and walked over.

Jian Wushuang was currently using the name ‘Jian Yi’  and his strength was only at the ordinary Dao Lord level.

Seeing the approaching figure, Jian Wushuang felt a bit annoyed, but for the sake of concealing his identity, he endured it and smiled, saying, “Brother Li Hai!”

“Jian Yi, how about considering our Iron Sea Sect? We are a powerful force on Redwood Island If you join us, I can recommend you internally. We can hunt demonic beasts at sea together—safe and enjoyable.” Li Hai strongly recommended, but Jian Wushuang maintained a smiling refusal.

Since he boarded the ship, this person had been pestering him with recommendations for the Iron Sea Sect, boasting about the powerful

Emperors in the sect and how formidable it was. It was getting on Jian Wushuangs nerves.

Jian Wushuang, despite continuous polite refusals, managed to escape into the cabin’s room.

Not fearing confrontation with strong individuals, he dreaded getting entangled with such people.

Internal recommendations were nothing more than a set of excuses.

He had some understanding of Redwood Island. It was populated by various small forces, with hardly any tier 4 Emperors. All of them were expanding and recruiting.

Those who could recommend others would receive valuable treasures.

For the sake of these treasures, Li Hai spared no effort.

Inside the cabin, several Dao Lord experts were drinking and discussing matters related to Redwood Island.

Li Hai entered the cabin with Jian Wushuang, initially considering trying his luck. However, upon seeing the people drinking, he abandoned the idea and walked over.

Some of these people had just been recruited by him, while a sturdy and muscular man was a leader from the Iron Sea Sect. He looked down on recruiting people for such meager treasures because his brother-in-law was an Emperor-level powerhouse.

“Li Hai, haven’t you settled that kid yet?” The robust man sneered, glancing at Jian Wushuang.

Li Hai, appearing as an amiable person, spread his hands and said, “No way, it seems to be his first time at sea, not familiar with Redwood Island. He’ll understand once he gets there.”

“I’ll go talk to him!”

Hauling his wine bottle, the robust man walked towards the window where Jian Wushuang was.

In a domineering manner, he hung his arm around Jian Wushuangs shoulder, reeking of alcohol as he spoke. However, Jian Wushuang promptly pushed him several steps away.

The burly man sneered, frustrated. “Hmph, ignorant fool. You’ll regret going to Redwood Island. When the time comes, you won’t even know how you died.”

He felt that Jian Wushuang was not giving him any face and openly mocked him in front of everyone.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, thankful that they were about to arrive. He had no interest in getting into a conflict with these people.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If it came to a fight, the strongest person on this ship was only a tier 3 Emperor. Jian Wushuang could easily tear him apart.

Looking through the massive crystal window, he gazed at Redwood Island. True to its name, the entire island was bathed in shades of red.

Gigantic coral formations stood like small mountains, towering over the surroundings..
