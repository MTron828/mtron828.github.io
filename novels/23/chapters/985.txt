Chapter 986: Out

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Outside the imperial palace, there laid a mountain which no one ever spoke of.

In the mountain, Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, Xue Lingtian, along with Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan, the two sworn brothers of Jian Wushuang, were all waiting.

Not long after, a figure in white flew over from the distant sky and landed.

It was Leng Rushuang. Her expressionless face, as pale as a piece of white paper, matched her usual icy cool demeanour.

“Shuang’er.” Emperor Xiao called out to his daughter. He was shaking and looking at her with complicated feelings.

“It’s all the wrench’s fault!” Emperor Xiao growled repeatedly.

“Father.” Leng Rushuang looked at Emperor Xiao and said, “It’s all in the past. There is no use in blaming Mother. Just let her stay in Thunder Hell and live the rest of her life in peace.”

Emperor Xiao could not let it go simply.

“Girl, come here.” Tang Emperor beckoned Leng Rushuang over.

“Grandmaster.” Leng Rushuang greeted him politely, walking over to his side.

With a raise of his hand, Tang Emperor left a mark on Leng Rushuang’s body.

“Grandmaster, what’s this?” Leng Rushuang asked, confused.

“All of us went behind Jian Wushuang’s back to make this one-day marriage possible. After you leave, he will definitely lose his sanity and may even end up mentally deranged, this would impede his growth from then on. This mark here represents his last hope.”

“The young man has a good heart. As long as he has a little hope, he will not give up, and will instead be motivated. This will be good for both you and him in the future.” Tang Emperor said.

“I understand.” Leng Rushuang nodded slightly. All of a sudden, her body shook violently, letting out a horrible and cold aura.

“Time is running out.” Leng Rushuang said with an agonized expression. She let out a low cry, “Father, grandmaster, farewell!”

“Everybody, farewell!”

“Jian Wushuang… I’ll see you in the next life.”

With her last words, Leng Rushuang fell into silence and calmness.

Everything surrounding her was in a state of complete stillness as well.

Wearing faces of discomfort, Emperor Xiao, Tang Emperor and Emperor Yun fixed their stares on Leng Rushuang.

Leng Rushuang stood motionlessly, still wrapped by the icy aura.

All of a sudden, Leng Rushuang raised her head harshly. At the same time, the horrible icy aura spread and covered the whole surroundings.

Everywhere sank into coldness, and time seemed to be frozen.

An evil and crazy expression began to creep its way onto Leng Rushuang’s beautiful face.

“Ha ha!” Leng Rushuang laughed in an insane manner, sending echoes everywhere.

“I’m out!”

“After being sealed for so many years, I am finally out!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Now this body is finally under my control.” The laughter continued.

The horrible laughter placed Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao and the other people on the mountain on edge. Emperor Xiao clenched his fists.

He knew that this “thing” in front of him was what his daughter had been tortured by for years.

“Well?”

The laughter stopped abruptly, and wicked eyes landed on Tang Emperor and the others. With a eerie smile, ‘Leng Rushuang’ said, “Hey, Tang Emperor, did you just leave a mark on this body? Why, do you really want Jian Wushuang to find me?”

“Why not?” Tang Emperor replied coldly.

“Xue’er, how dare you be so disrespectful to your grandmaster?” Emperor Xiao reprimanded.

“Shut up!”

‘Leng Rushuang’ glowered at Emperor Xiao, and sent a blast of the cold aura at him.?Emperor Xiao’s body gave a tremble and a muffled groan, and a trail of blood came out from the corner of his mouth.

“Xue’er is not for you to call.”

“Do you really think I would take you as my father? It was because I was sealed, I had no other choice!” ‘Leng Rushuang’ said coldly.

Emperor Xiao’s face turned gloomy.

“Though I should thank Jian Wushuang. Without his help, this stupid woman would never have broken the seal, and I would not have been released so easily. She was stupid enough to sacrifice her life for a man.”

“Shut up!” Emperor Xiao shouted furiously.

“You have complete control over the body now, you can go now. If you have any other concerns, feel free to voice them out, I will settle them all!” Tang Emperor scorned.

“Resolve them all?” Leng Rushuang glanced at Tang Emperor with a cold smile, “Old man, I have just gotten control over this body and I need more time to gain my strength. I am not a match for you, so I’ll have to reject your offer.”

“Be assured, I had made promises to this foolish woman. She had made some ridiculous demands, but I accepted them since she had been quite nice to me over the years. Alright, this world is too small, I am not intending to stay here any longer, I will leave now!”

“Ha ha…”

With a crazed smile, Leng Rushuang’s figure rose into the air and within the next moment, disappeared from the world.

As Leng Rushuang left, Tang Emperor and the others were helpless.

“Damn it!” Emperor Xiao punched the ground, leaving a wide and deep pit behind. His body was shaking wildly, his face was veiny with anger and his eyes were blood-shot. He was unwilling to accept all of this.

“Master, can’t you do anything at all?” Emperor Xiao looked at Tang Emperor with grieving eyes.

Tang Emperor shook his head and sighed.

“Primordial Great Sin!”

“Every Primordial Great Sinner is both a tragedy and a disaster. I would keep her here if I can, even if Shuang’er has to die.”

“But alas, with her advancement to this current stage, I don’t have confidence to make her stay.”

“Fortunately, instead of choosing to stay, she decided to leave this world. There are countless powerful experts in the Eternal Chaotic World. I hope someone there can kill her before she brings disaster.”

Tang Emperor could do nothing but sigh. Tang Huan turned to look at the others behind him.

“Now we need to think of an explanation for Jian Wushuang.”
