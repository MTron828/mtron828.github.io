Chapter 1198: The Sixth Palace Master!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It hasn’t even been five thousand years since Jian Wushuang began his cultivation!”

“But when he found out that war is imminent and that our Green Fire World is in danger, what did he do?”

“He teamed up with us to attack the former capital of the Jin Kingdom, slaughter the enemies, and destroy the remnants of the kingdom’s foundation on this battlefield, all to eke out a tiny hope of survival for us!”

“But this means that the Jin Kingdom will know he’s still alive and will most certainly target him. We can say that he’s already cornered himself to the edge of the cliff for the sake of our Green Fire World! If the army of Jin Kingdom truly descends upon us, he would be the first one they wish to kill!”

“But look at all of you.”

“Did you spend so many years living only to become a coward?”

The Master of Samsara Temple scolded the Holy Masters.

The Holy Masters gathered around were all ashamed of themselves.

It was true that Jian Wushuang had pushed himself to the brink of death when he attacked the Monarch of Jin Kingdom. He had done it for the sake of the Green Fire World.

They, who were many years older than Jian Wushuang, appeared to be so much inferior in contrast.

This inferiority was not only in terms of strength but courage as well.

“If we’re talking about strength, I know I’m no match for Jian Wushuang. But when it comes to passion, I’m not any weaker!”

“I’ve long found my long life to be sufficient. If a youngster like Jian Wushuang isn’t afraid of the forces of the Jin Kingdom, what do I have to fear?”

“Come at me, Jin Kingdom! If worse comes to worst, I’ll just die!”

“Let’s have an all-out war against the Jin Kingdom! Even if we die in the end, we must still unfang the Jin Kingdom before that!”

Booming voices resounded on the empty ground as these Holy Masters began to get fired up.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple wore satisfied smiles on their faces when they saw this scene.

They tried to use Jian Wushuang’s bravery to provoke these Holy Masters and from the looks of it, their plan worked rather effectively.

The passion in these Holy Masters had been thoroughly invoked. Their morale was largely boosted as well.

“Swoosh!” Just then, Jian Wushuang appeared next to the Master of Samsara Temple.

“Boom!” A majestic and boundless air surged from within him and pervaded every corner of the empty ground. Silence once again fell over the Holy Masters.

“Listen well. From today onward, Jian Wushuang is the sixth Palace Master of our Green Fire Palace. His position is equivalent to mine!” the Master of Samsara Temple announced in a booming voice.

“Greetings, Palace Master!”

“Greetings, Palace Master!”

The Holy Masters underneath them all paid their respects to Jian Wushuang, fervent energy burning in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood there, overlooking everything underneath. His expression was rather strange.

“Master of Samsara Temple, isn’t this a little too much?” he asked via telepathy. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He noticed that the determined look on the Holy Masters. Evidently, they had prepared themselves for certain death.

“Too much?” The Master of Samsara Temple shook his head. “There’s only a shred of hope for our Green Fire World and this shred of hope is only possible if we all carry the determination to die. It’s only when we’re prepared to pay any price that we can hold onto the hope!”

“This includes even me and all those who will participate in the war. Everyone must carry the determination to die!”

“Jian Wushuang, you must also mentally prepare yourself!”

Jian Wushuang was stunned but promptly recovered and nodded seriously.

“There are 80 years before the army of Jin Kingdom will arrive!”

“Even though 80 years aren’t a long time, it’s also a rare chance for us to make our preparations!”

“Go and prepare for the war!”

The Master of Samsara Temple’s voice rang in their ears.

The Holy Masters of the Green Fire Palace immediately set out to do as ordered.

…

Jian Wushuang, the Master of Samsara Temple, and the Master of Void Temple were seated inside a towering palace.

“Jian Wushuang, we’ll typically hold a three-day banquet to celebrate the appointment of a new Palace Master but we couldn’t do so due to the urgency of the situation,” the Master of Samsara Temple said.

“No matter. It’s not too late to hold a banquet when we claim victory 80 years later,” Jian Wushuang said with a chuckle.

“You’re right.” The Master of Samsara Temple laughed. “The war this time will be more perilous than the one five million years ago but our Green Fire World isn’t completely helpless. If we unite and do whatever necessary, we stand at least a 10 percent chance of victory!”

“10 percent chance of victory?” Jian Wushuang’s heart thumped.

He found the estimation to be too optimistic.

There will be countless experts in the army of Jin Kingdom this time, including the Monarch himself. Their collective strength was at least ten times stronger than that of the Green Fire World.

It was already a miracle that they have any hope of winning considering how disparate their forces were.

The Master of Samsara Temple looked at Jian Wushuang. “Why? Do you find it unbelievable?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang gave a small nod.

The Master of Samsara Temple burst out laughing. Beside him, the Master of Void Temple was also smiling. The former then continued, “Jian Wushuang, you’ve only become an official Palace Master today and don’t know many of the true secrets of our palace. I’ll inform you now.”

“Secrets?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“You should be very well aware that the battlefield that we are on contains countless opportunities and treasures. The battlefield itself is such a priceless treasure that even the Jin Kingdom, that originates from the Ancient World, desperately covets it. And yet our Green Fire Palace has existed in this place for more than 40 million years!”

“How can our palace be underestimated when we have accumulated resources over a whopping 40 million years?” The Master of Samsara Temple laughed.

“You’ve seen the Puppet Fighter on the Universe Master level. Even though it’s one of our treasures, but it can’t be considered as our true trump card.”

“There are three true trump cards in the Green Fire Palace!”

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow.?“Three trump cards?”

He had previously guessed that the Green Fire Palace would certainly have trump cards in hand after so many years on the battlefield. Today, he was proven correct.

However, he did not know what those trump cards were.

“Our first trump card is our tactical formation!” the Master of Samsara Temple said.

“Tactical formation?” Surprise flitted across Jian Wushuang’s expression.

He was familiar with formations but he had never heard of a tactical formation.

“Jian Wushuang, do you remember how you and your father killed the Ancient Demon Clan back in the Samsara Continent when rescuing your mother?” the Master of Samsara Temple asked.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Then you must also remember that the Ancient Demon Clan dispatched their Nine Divine Guards who made up an Ancient God Tactical Formation,” he continued asking with a smile.

“Ancient God Tactical Formation?” Jian Wushuang’s heart jolted.

Naturally, he remembered that Ancient God Tactical Formation.

The Nine Divine Guards had been mere Dao Masters of varying strengths but when they paired with the Ancient God lineage and teamed up to constitute the Ancient God Tactical Formation, their collective might was incredible. In fact, they were strong enough to rival a Holy Master!
