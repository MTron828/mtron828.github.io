Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

The three rays of purple light quivered, then the energy concentrated and suddenly substantiated into three purple spears. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The three purple spears flew out at terrifying speed.

Instantly, they appeared behind the three Sir Gods of Star Extermination Alliance.

The three Sir Gods were in a ferocious fight with their opponents and two out of three of them were suppressed. Dealing with the purple spears that attacked out of nowhere without any symptoms.

The three Sir Gods’ faces grew grave.

“Sh*t!”

“D*mn!!”

“No!!”

Bang! Bang! Psst!

There were three continuous thuds. The three Sir Gods were hit by the purple spears directly.

Among them, there were two that got severely injured and fell back under the attack of the purple spear. The last one was weaker in defense and he died on the spot after the purple spear pierced his body.

“Not bad.”

In the depth of the galaxy, Hall Master Yuan saw the effects that the three purple spears had brought about and he was satisfied.

“After ten breaths, I can carry out the second attack!”

“One breath… Two breaths…”

Hall Master Yuan had already started to count.

Universe Galaxy was from ancient times and its power was far beyond a simple defense formation. In terms of attack and auxiliary power, it was shockingly powerful.

Since the four one-eyed giants at the beginning until the three purple spears, they were all techniques that Universe Galaxy possessed.

Plus, Universe Galaxy had been severely damaged and it could only perform simple techniques. If Universe Galaxy were to receive abundant heaven and earth spiritual energy to recover the galaxy completely, with the guardian of Universe Galaxy, even if there were to be a Great Emperor expert that barged in personally, he could only enter, not leave!!

On the battlefield…

“How could it be?”

“This is impossible.”

The higher-ups of Star Extermination Alliance, also the three Peak Emperor Gods who were fighting with Jian Wushuang, had been keeping watch of the surrounding battlefield.

They could see the scenery on the battlefield clearly.

Star Extermination Alliance was already under control.

They were completely suppressed.

In terms of overall fighting power, they were weaker than Lineage of Star by a slight bit. On top of that, Lineage of Star had the aid of the formation. Hence, their difference in power became even greater.

From the start of the war until then, it was merely a short while. But Star Extermination Alliance was under their full control. If they were to continue the war, Lineage of Star would gain the upper hand bit by bit and finally defeat Star Extermination Alliance completely.

“I have to figure out a way immediately. Otherwise, we of Star Extermination Alliance will be defeated!!” Palace Master Wu Luo roared.

“Go all out. Give full play to whatever trump card you have. Hurry up and kill Jian Wushuang. Only when the three of us have the bandwidth to fight the others, there would be a turning for this unfavorable situation,” the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church said.

“What are we waiting for then? Let’s go all out!” Number One Divine King bellowed.

Jian Wushuang killed his second brother. His intention to kill Jian Wushuang was much stronger than anyone else.

The moment Jian Wushuang heard the conversation between the three of them, he scoffed, “All out? I’d like to see whose techniques are more powerful!”

Jian Wushuang said, then he flipped his palm. There was a scroll painting that he threw in the void above.

Instantly, the void above the galaxy started to take a drastic change.

The originally resplendent galaxy suddenly replaced by a huge and beautiful world with mountains and rivers.

“What is this?”

Many experts on the battlefield couldn’t help but lift their heads up to look.

Simultaneously, they were astonished by the huge world above.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold but his body was churning with divine power. The divine power blended with the world of mountains and rivers completely.

“Nine-province of the Universe, Qing province as the seal!”

“The first move, split the heavens!”

Hong!

Along with Jian Wushuang’s handprint, a complete continent descended from the world of mountains and rivers directly.

The continent pressed down at the entire battlefield but was diminished forcibly under Jian Wushuang’s control. In the end, it only covered the region that the three Peak Emperor Gods were in.

Feeling the boundless power contained in the seal, the three Emperor Gods’ faces grew extremely solemn.

“Let’s take action together to shatter the continent,” Palace Master Wu Luo said.

“Alright,” Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church nodded heavily.

Instantly, the three Peak Emperor Gods let their strongest fighting powers run wild.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The three attacks were like huge meteorites. They hit the descended lofty continent like lightning.

Along with the loud noises, the lofty continent shattered into pieces under the attack of the three meteorites.

There was no change in Jian Wushuang’s expression when he saw the scene.

In his hand, there was still billowing divine power concentrating.

“Nine-province of the Universe, Yu Province as the seal!”

“The second move, Hack the Earth!”

Hong!

The second lofty continent descended.

The power contained by the continent was obviously much stronger than the first continent.

The terrifying power suppressed the entire universe and the corners of the three Emperor Gods’ lips were twitching.

They knew clearly that it was definitely impossible to withstand such a terrifying attack if they were to be alone.

Then, there were three Peak Emperor Gods joining forces after all.

“Go!”

Palace Master Wu Luo roared and instantly performed his strongest skills.

The ancient hammer in his hand immediately increased tenfold under his control.

The soaring rage swept out.

The hammer was like a real star. As Palace Master Wu Luo waved, the star suddenly burst out.

Number One Divine King looked cold as boundless crimson fog flowed out of his body as though he was covered in a crimson armor.

His eyes were like crimson suns and the crimson saber in his hands was increasing in size tremendously as well.

The towering saber shadows concentrated in the void and the saber shadows superposed onto one another intended to split the heaven into half.

Wow!

The blade light swung out and it was whistling as it flew at the descending lofty continent.

As for the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church, he used both his hands.

The two palms were covered in boundless golden lights and they flipped out two palms of Real Martial Arts.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were terrifying noises again and the second continent collapsed once again.

“It collapsed?”

Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Arts just let out a breath of relief but they had yet to reveal a smile.

Jian Wushuang’s hand, that contained boundless divine power, waved again.

“The third move, Overwhelm the Rain!”

Rumble.

There was another continent that descended.

The continent was much stronger than the first and second seal.

Nine-province seal, the third move, Overwhelm The Rain, also the strongest seal that Jian Wushuang could perform with the assistance of Mountain River Map!

Under the full explosion of his fierce divine power and ancient tribe bloodline, the power of the seal was given full play completely.

“There’s more?!”

The three Peak Emperor Gods were shocked.
