Chapter 1135: Gain the Upper Hand?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Boom!”

The sandstorm burst open and Celestial Master Malignity reappeared.

Jian Wushuang grinned. “Celestial Master Malignity, your speed is indeed incredible but you’re much weaker than mine strength-wise.”

It was true that in terms of speed, Celestial Master Malignity was the fastest among all Celestial Masters that he had ever met. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, speaking of offensive power, Celestial Master Malignity was just a little better than an advanced Celestial Master. He was still way below any other Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm. When he unleashed Heaven’s Bane, Celestial Master Malignity was immediately rendered to a distinct disadvantage since it was a competition of power.

“Bastard!”

Celestial Master Malignity looked gloomy. He looked at the Blaze Quicksand that had engulfed the entire Oblivion Palace.

He could feel the terrifying power surging from it. His heart raced as his eyes tracked the Blaze Quicksand.

“Celestial Master Malignity, let’s see who the loser will be.” Jian Wushuang chuckled as he sprang into motion.

Celestial Master Malignity moved at the same time. The sandstorm appeared in front of him the moment he moved, blasting him with ferocious power.

“Damn it!” Celestial Master Malignity cursed. He had to stop moving to fend off the sandstorm.

However, after being fended off for one time, the sandstorm came blasting again…

It came one after another, seemingly without an end.

Under the impact of the sandstorm, he could hardly exert his speed. On the contrary, Jian Wushuang could attack as he wished. They were no longer competing in terms of speed, but power instead.

If he was not threatened by the Blaze Quicksand, he could easily dodge Jian Wushuang’s attack. But now… he could not do anything. He could only withstand with all his might. When they were fighting head-on, the sword power of Jian Wushuang was way stronger than him.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Rumbling sounds continued to reverberate in Oblivion Palace. Several breaths later…

“Swoosh!”

Celestial Master Malignity was sent tumbling backward once again. He looked absolutely miserable with his face ashen and blood oozing out of the corners of his mouth. He was evidently badly injured.

Jian Wushuang continued to emanate a vigorous aura and his battle prowess was still in peak condition.

“Celestial Master Malignity, are you convinced now?” Jian Wushuang stood before Celestial Master Malignity with a smug smile on his face.

“Damn!” Celestial Master Malignity fixed his gaze at Jian Wushuang. His resentment was rapidly building.

He was not convinced at all.

He was angry with the fact that the spot to enter the World of Swords was given to Jian Wushuang. To make things worse, he could not hurt Jian Wushuang even for a bit. Instead, Jian Wushuang even defeated him.

Ever since Jian Wushuang utilized the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, it posed a big obstacle in Celestial Master Malignity’s attempt to make use of his speed. Under such circumstance, the strength of Celestial Master Malignity could only be considered slightly better than that of an advanced Celestial Master. Without his speed, he could do nothing but get defeated.

“When Sunrise Sword Emperor said he’d give me the spot to enter the World of Swords to me, I didn’t know that you were one of the candidates. I didn’t mean to take your place. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Sunrise Sword Emperor about it,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“I know that you’re angry, but things happen. Either way, I won’t hand you the spot as you wish. If you’re still unconvinced, you can pick another fight with me. But let me remind you that you’re definitely not powerful enough to defeat me now!”

He then returned the Blaze Quicksand to the golden gourd and left without sparing Celestial Master Malignity another glance.

Celestial Master Malignity stood there quivering as he watched Jian Wushuang leave. His heart was filled with frustrations.

The five Palace Masters commanded the utmost authority in Green Fire Palace. There was nothing he could do if they had decided to let Jian Wushuang enter the World of Swords. He just wanted to mess with Jian Wushuang to vent his rage and frustration. But in the end, he did not even get teach Jian Wushuang a lesson and suffered defeat instead.

Meanwhile, numerous Celestial Masters had gathered outside Oblivion Palace to wait for the result.

“It has been quite some time. Don’t you think the battle between Jian Wushuang and Celestial Master Malignity should have ended by now?”

“Who do you think will be the winner?”

“Do you still have to ask? Of course it’d be Celestial Master Malignity.”

“I agree. His speed gives him an absolute advantage from the beginning.”

The Celestial Masters chatted among themselves, most of them believing that the winner of the battle would be Celestial Master Malignity.

After all, Celestial Master Malignity had made a name for himself a long time ago. His incredible display of speed was also well-known.

After a while, Jian Wushuang stepped out of Oblivion Palace.

The Green Fire Palace experts immediately turned to look in his direction.

“Jian Wushuang is out! Why is he the one to come out first?”

“What about Celestial Master Malignity?”

“Jian Wushuang looks calm and his aura is steady. It seems like he isn’t injured!”

They all wore strange expressions.

Celestial Master Yu Ding came to Jian Wushuang and asked with a smile, “What’s the outcome?”

“The result?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “You can ask Celestial Master Malignity when he comes out. I’ll be leaving first.”

He ignored the other Celestial Masters and headed for his residence.

Those Celestial Masters continued to wait around. Soon, Celestial Master Malignity walked out.

They noticed that Celestial Master Malignity had a bitter expression on his face.

“Celestial Master Malignity, what’s the outcome?”

“Celestial Master Malignity, didn’t you tell us that you would record the battle with the mirror token? Where is it?”

A Celestial Master came to ask him.

“The mirror token?” Celestial Master Malignity’s face darkened. “I didn’t use the mirror token.”

“What?” the Celestial Masters asked in disbelief.

When they received the message, Celestial Master Malignity had clearly said that he would use the mirror token to record the battle.

“Jian Wushuang is indeed powerful. He gained the upper hand in this battle.”

That was all Celestial Master Malignity had to say. He ignored the rest of the questions and left immediately.

A commotion broke out outside Oblivion Palace.

“The upper hand? Did Celestial Master Malignity say that Jian Wushuang gained the upper hand?”

“Did he really admit it?”

“How could it be possible? Not losing the battle would be the best result that Jian Wushuang could hope for! How could it be possible that he even gained the upper hand?”

“He didn’t even show us the mirror token. Is it true that Jian Wushuang only gained the upper hand? Is there more to the story?”

These Celestial Masters could not stop thinking about it.

Nearly all of them thought that Jian Wushuang would lose the battle but the result had turned out so differently.
