Chapter 3195: Challenge

——

“Palace Master Bai Xing is unfair? You really dare to say it.” The black-robed old man revealed a half-smile.

Duan Lang’s body trembled. Although he still gritted his teeth, he did not dare to continue.

Palace Master Bai Xing’s status in the temporal temple was only below that palace master. It could be said that in the entire Divine Beginning Realm, Palace Master Bai Xing was one of the few people who stood at the peak, how could a little saint like him say such a supreme existence?

Fortunately, Palace Master Bai Xing did not hear this. Otherwise.

“Duan Lang, listen. Palace Master Bai Xing has always done things fairly. Before he gave this spot to Heavenly Sword Marquis, he specially arranged a training mission for Heavenly Sword Marquis. That training mission is extraordinary. It can be said to be extremely harsh. Even an ordinary Invincible Saint might not be able to complete it, but Heavenly Sword Marquis did,” said the black-clothed old man.

What he said was the truth.

Temple Master Bai Xing had arranged for him to kill all 13 axes.

One or two of the 13 axes might look easy to kill, but to kill all 13 of them, the 13 axes had a monster-slaughtering formation. In a head-on fight, even the Invincible Saint would be defeated.

Jian Wushuang was able to kill all 13 axes because he had mastered the shadowless escape art. If it were anyone else, Duan Lang would not have been able to kill all 13 axes.

“Let me put it this way. Since Temple Master Bai Xing gave the quota to Heavenly Sword Marquis and did not give it to you, he must think that Heavenly Sword Marquis is stronger than you,” the black-clothed elder added.

“Impossible!”

Duan Lang immediately shouted, “Three hundred years ago, Heavenly Sword Marquis was only a rank four True Saint. He could only kill a rank seven early-stage True Saint with average strength. Now, only three hundred years have passed. Even if his strength has improved greatly, he is only slightly stronger than an ordinary peak rank seven True Saint. Compared to those experts who are close to Invincible True Saint, he is definitely much weaker. How can he compare to me?”

“I don’t believe it. I absolutely don’t believe that his strength has already surpassed mine. I refuse to accept it!”

The black-clothed elder frowned slightly.

“Lord Hunyuan, I wish to seek an audience with Hall Master White Star. Or, I would like you to pass a message to Hall Master White Star saying that I want to challenge Heavenly Sword Marquis. I want to defeat him in front of everyone. And if Heavenly Sword Marquis really has the strength, as long as he can defeat me, then I will naturally accept it wholeheartedly,” Duan Lang said in a deep voice.

“Challenge?” The black-clothed elder raised his eyebrows, and a playful smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. “Sure, I’ll send a message to Hall Master Bai Xing right now.”

“Thank you, Lord Hunyuan,” Duan Lang said immediately.

The black-clothed elder immediately sent a message to Hall Master Bai Xing, and the result was quickly obtained.

“Duan Lang, Hall Master Bai Xing already guessed that you might be unconvinced. She wanted me to tell you that you want to challenge Heavenly Sword Marquis. This is fine. As long as Heavenly Sword Marquis agrees, you can naturally fight. However, since her order has already been given, it will not be changed. In other words, Heavenly Sword Marquis will still be on the list of five people who will enter the Blood Wave Realm. Do you understand this?” The black-clothed elder looked at Duan Lang.

“Is there no way to change it?” Duan Lang clenched his hands tightly. His fingertips had already pinched into his flesh. “Alright, even if I can’t enter the Blood Wave Realm, I will fight for this honor for myself.”

“Alright, wait here. I will inform you when the Heavenly Sword Marquis agrees.”

The black-clothed old man said this before turning around and leaving.

“Sword Marquis.”

Duan Lang’s eyes were filled with an unprecedented fierce light.

…

In the courtyard where Jian Wushuang lived.

“Challenge? Duan Lang wants to challenge me?” Jian Wushuang’s expression immediately became strange when he received the news.

However, after thinking for a moment, he could understand.

Because if he did not appear, the spot would belong to Duan Lang. Duan Lang even thought that he was almost certain, but because of his appearance, he snatched the spot for Duan Lang to enter the Blood Wave Realm, how could Duan Lang be satisfied?

“Temple Master Bai Xing has given the order and will not change it. This spot is definitely yours, so you don’t have to accept the challenge. There’s no need to pay attention to Duan Lang.” The black-clothed elder stood in front of Jian Wushuang and smiled. “But Temple Master Bai Xing wants you to fight and defeat Duan Lang head-on. That would be better.”

“Yes, I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He understood Temple Master Bai Xing’s intention.

After all, the quota to enter the blood wave world was decided by Temple Master Bai Xing alone. If he did not show his strength or refuse Duan Lang’s challenge, many people might think that he was not strong enough, this would also affect Temple Master Bai Xing and make people feel that Temple Master Bai Xing was unfair.

Therefore, he had to directly defeat Duan Lang with his strength. Only then could he shut everyone’s mouth and make them be convinced.

Just like when Jian Wushuang got the quota to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, the genius disciples of the three palaces were also unconvinced. Moreover, when Jian Wushuang appeared on the Heaven-cleaving Star, the most dazzling genius immediately came to challenge him, however, after Jian Wushuang defeated that genius cleanly, no one dared to say another word.

In this world, strength was the only way to speak.

If you did not show your strength, no one would take you seriously. However, as long as you showed your strength and your fists were very hard, it would naturally be frightening. No one dared to doubt it.

“Please tell Duan Lang that I agree to fight with him,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Good.” The black-robed elder nodded and left.

Soon, the news of the fight between Jian Wushuang and Duan Lang spread throughout the time-space island.

…

A slender white-robed youth sat quietly under the giant time-space beast God with his eyes closed.

This white-robed youth carried a blood-colored battle saber on his back. It was as though his entire being had become one with the surrounding spacetime.

And at this moment, sou!

A human figure suddenly swept over from the void beside him.

The person who arrived was a beautiful red-haired girl with a bit of mischievousness.

“Qian Hongzi, I heard that you’ve already returned to the temporal island. I guessed that you’re here.”The red-haired mischievous girl came to the side of the white-robed youth.

“Flying snow, is something the matter?” The white-robed young man still had his eyes closed.

“Of course, there’s something the matter. I’m afraid that you still don’t know. That Duan Lang is about to have a head-on battle with Heavenly Sword Marquis.” The red-haired mischievous girl said.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The white-robed young man’s expression moved, and his eyes slightly opened. “Is that the Heavenly Sword Marquis who used a fourth level True Saint to kill a seventh level True Saint?”

“Yes, that’s him. He also came to the time-space island 300 years ago,” the red-haired girl said.
