Chapter 2338: 1 vs 3

“Are you alright?” Xiang Zong asked the blue-haired lady.

“Not a big issue. Fortunately, you guys are around. Otherwise, even if hadn’t died from that strike, I’d be severely injured.” Now, fear was in her eyes as she looked at Jian Wushuang. The earlier strike had indeed been dangerous.

“You killed Zhuge Yun first and almost killed a Divine Demon Realm expert from our Xiang Family. Brat, although I know nothing about your background, you will definitely still die today.” Xiang Zong was solemn and intense killing intent gleamed in his eyes.

“Definitely die? By your hand?” Jian Wushuang said with contempt.

“I alone would naturally not be enough. However, what if three Divine Demon Realm experts were to team up?” Xiang Zong shouted.

“Team up? Three against one.” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows.

Xiang Zong took a glance at the two people next to him and said, “This brat is the greatest uncertainty on the battlefield. Only by finishing him off can we achieve the outcome we desire. Let’s team up against him!”

“Alright!”

The two Divine Demon Realm experts from Xiang Family nodded.

The next instant, the trio struck at the same time.

The three Divine Demon Realm experts turned into three bolts of lightning as they charged towards Jian Wushuang.

“Scumbags!!”

A short distance away, Zhuo Yunfeng was infuriated when he witnessed what was happening. “Three Divine Demon Realm experts teaming up against a junior that isn’t even twenty years old? The Xiang Family is truly embarrassing!!”

“Shameless! Shameless!!”

Some experts in the Lin Mansion berated.

However, the three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family were unmoved.

What a joke! Jian Wushuang had killed Zhuge Yun in a direct clash.

Zhuge Yun was widely regarded as the number one sword cultivator in Anjiu Prefecture previously. Although he had not reached the peak of Third Grade Divine Demon, he wasn’t weak at all. Lin Tiefeng and Elder Chen, who were both elite Third Grade Divine Demons, wouldn’t be confident about killing him even if they were confident of suppressing or defeating him.

Yet, he had still been killed by Jian Wushuang.

This was a testament that Jian Wushuang wasn’t any weaker than Lin Tiefeng or Elder Chen.

If they were to deal with an expert of this level, they would likely not end up any better than Zhuge Yun. Teaming up was the wisest decision. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, even though the three Divine Demon Realm experts from Xiang Family had teamed up, Jian Wushuang didn’t feel any fear.

When the three Divine Demon Realm experts from Xiang Family struck, Jian Wushuang made his move as well.

He was like a spectre and he utilized his understanding of Spacetime Rules of Order to the limits. In the blink of an eye, he clashed with the three Divine Demon Realm experts.

The family head of Xiang Family used a long purple staff. It was filled with overwhelming strength and smashed towards Jian Wushuang.

The blue-haired lady was using a long black spear. She was just like a silent venomous snake, constantly going for Jian Wushuang’s openings.

The last expert was a burly old man with long hair. He was using a pair of red gloves. When clashing with Jian Wushuang directly, he was like two volcanoes that were constantly erupting against Jian Wushuang.

Even when facing the powerful and daunting attacks of these experts, Jian Wushuang still appeared exceptionally composed.

He put on a perfect display of swordsmanship.

Each move looked casual and simple but was fluid and consistent.

It was especially so for the unique essence of his sword techniques. Sometimes, he was fast and violent, while at other times he appeared soft and flimsy. This often threw his opponents off their tempo.

His movements were even more creepy. With his Spacetime Rules of Order, the three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family couldn’t keep up with him at all.

When Jian Wushuang had fought Zhuge Yun moments ago, he had not shown his Sword Principle at all. He had been just casually swinging his sword and yet was evenly matched against Zhuge Yun. In fact, some considered him to have an edge against Zhuge Yun. Now that he was using his full strength, he wasn’t in a disadvantageous stage despite facing three opponents at the same time.

The fighting raged on the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang’s battle with the three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family was equally intense. The three Divine Demon Realm experts used all their strength but still couldn’t gain an upper hand against Jian Wushuang.

“One against three and they are evenly matched?”

“This...This... Is this a joke?”

“Those are three Divine Demon Realm experts?”

When the surrounding people witnessed the battle, they were completely stupefied.

The three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family weren’t elites among Third Grade Divine Demons. The family head of Xiang Family, Xiang Zong, was only nearing the top-tier Divine Demons and was still a little inferior to Lin Tiefeng and Elder Chen.

However, this was three Divine Demon Realm experts teaming up!

Even Lin Tiefeng and Elder Chen would have been suppressed against their coalition. Perhaps only a Second Grade Divine Demon could deal with three of them with ease.

And now, the strength displayed by Jian Wushuang...

“Could he possess the battle strength of a Second Grade Divine Demon?”

“But he’s only at the Chaotic Realm!”

No one could believe what they were seeing.

Indeed, if they had not seen with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed an Early Stage Chaotic Realm could go against three Chaotic Divine Demons at the same time. This wasn’t possible.

However, reality had proven otherwise.

“There’s hope. My Lin Family has hope!!!”

While Jian Wushuang was clashing with the three Divine Demon Realm experts, those from the Lin Mansion were feeling overjoyed. Lin Tiefeng was especially so.

Previously, he had been in despair. He had thought that the annihilation of Lin Mansion was inevitable. But now, although Lin Mansion was still in grave danger, the appearance of Jian Wushuang had given him a glimmer of hope.

Disregarding all others, Jian Wushuang had killed a Divine Demon Realm expert from the Zhuge Family. Now, he was able to hold back three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family. This was the same as the other party losing the battle strength of four Divine Demons.

Only three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Zhuge Family and Xiang Family were free. This was one fewer than in the Lin Mansion.

The pressure that the Lin Mansion had to face had decreased substantially.

“Quick! Stop them! Stop the attacks of the Zhuge Family and Xiang Family!”

“Stop them and our Lin Mansion will have hope!”

Lin Tiefeng growled like a lunatic.

Some experts from the Lin Mansion had become extremely excited as well.

Initially, the majority of them had seen this as a hopeless situation. Some even thought of fleeing. However, strong battle desires had risen within them once again.

They could see hope now!

With the Divine Demon Realm experts holding back, they just had to stop experts below the Divine Demon Realm from Zhuge Family and Xiang Family. This made it a lot more possible for Lin Mansion to survive.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

An earth-shattering roar reverberated through the air as the men from Lin Mansion started their frantic counterattacks.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yuanchong found it hilarious. “A last-ditch struggle?

How foolish!”

“Kill everyone in the Lin Family. Exterminate them!”
