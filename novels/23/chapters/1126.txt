Chapter 1127: Lunatic!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Bastard, you amused yourself by watching us fighting and killing each other?”

“You treated us as playthings?”

“Damn it!”

Curses could be faintly heard among the crowd.

However, Dan Xin did not care. He added, “When I saw so many people come to this area, I knew it was time for me to come out again.”

“Since then, humans gathered here. Just as what you have seen, I threw out the elixirs one after another. You killed each other madly in order to contend for them and I had some fun. That was good for both sides.”

“Good for both sides?” The experts present gnashed their teeth and glared at Dan Xin.

Dan Xin said all this easily, but they risked their lives in order to attain those elixirs.

“Boy, you are Jian Wushuang, right?” Dan Xin’s evil voice sounded again.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang looked up at Dan Xin.

“You should be thankful to me. Without me, you couldn’t have obtained three Nirvana Elixirs at once.” Dan Xin grinned and said.

Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

He knew that he would not be so lucky. The last three Nirvana Elixirs that Dan Xin threw out moved directly toward him…

As he expected, Dan Xin did this on purpose.

“I’ve noticed you when you were scrambling for Life Medicines. You are merely an Eternal Realm rookie, but your battle strength is awesome. Even in the Eternal Chaotic World, you are like a Monster. I’m naturally more interested in you… ” Dan Xin smiled.

“Really? I really appreciate it.” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

It seemed that Dan Xin offered him benefits, in fact, Dan Xin amused himself by doing so. Although he had acquired three Nirvana Elixirs, he experienced a near escape.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s expression, Dan Xin was not annoyed. He looked around and said, “Fine, I’m not gonna talk nonsense to you guys anymore. Now that I appeared, I definitely will find a master. I’m wondering who is interested in my Dan Xin Palace?”

Upon hearing that, the experts from the two camps suddenly looked up and were burning with greed.

Their desire was stronger than ever.

They knew that there were a lot of precious elixirs in the Dan Xin Palace. Perhaps the Nirvana Elixirs and Life Elixirs were not the best elixirs there.

After all, they just saw Dan Xin crush two Nirvana Elixis causally and threw them away like rubbish with their own eyes.

Whoever was able to become the master of the Dan Xin Palace and obtain a large number of elixirs from it was bound to receive great opportunities. With these elixirs, be it the Jin Kindom or the Green Fire Palace, their strength would usher in an unprecedented leap.

“Dan Xin, tell me what conditions are required if I want to be the master of the Dan Xin Palace?” Sunrise Sword Emperor said indifferently.

“Hehe~~~” Dan Xin laughed weirdly and said, “Now I’m in charge of the Dan Xin Palace. It’s easy to become its master. You just need to find a way to please me.”

“To please you?” The experts from the two camps froze.

“How about this; there is a piece of iron in my hand and I believe you all know that, right?” Dan Xin stretched his hand so that everyone could see that piece of pitch-black iron clearly.

“This is… Black Iron?”

Everyone present could recognize it.

The Black Iron was the most common and abundant metal in the whole world.

Not to mention the Green Fire World, even in the Ancient World, it was very common.

“Dan Xin, what do you do with a piece of Black Iron?” The experts present were very puzzled.

“Listen, if you want to make me happy, you have to find a way to attain more Black Iron. I don’t need too much, five hundred thousand kilograms are sufficient.” Dan Xin said.

“Five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron?” The expressions of the experts here turned more eccentric.

There were plenty of ordinary metals such as the Black Iron in the Green Fire World. Not to mention five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron, they could easily collect even fifty million kilograms of such things. The problem was that as powerful Celestial Masters, they would not put such common things in their Interspatial Rings.

Which Celestial Master would pile up so much ordinary Black Iron in his Interspatial Ring?

“Haha, I know that you don’t have Black Iron at hand, but it exists in the area where you are right now. There are innumerable Black Iron veins under the mountains that look like a human face. You can acquire as much Black Iron as you want so long as you are willing to work hard.” Dan Xin smiled.

Hearing his words, the experts from the two camps were black in the face.

“How dare this bastard ask us to mine Black Iron?”

“He doesn’t want a master but makes fun of us!”

“Mining Black Iron? I have never done such a thing since I was born.”

Roars of low-pitched growls sounded among the crowd and the experts from the two camps glared at Dan Xin.

But no matter how wrathful they were, Dan Xin never paid any attention to that.

“The opportunity is right here. If you want to own the Dan Xin Palace, just give it a try. If you are not willing to do that, I won’t force you.” Dan Xin smiled. “In addition, the opportunities are limited. Whoever attains five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron can try first. You have to treasure the opportunity.”

After that, Dan Xin directly slept on the ground, ignoring the experts from the two camps.

Seeing this scene, though furious, the Celestial Masters from the two camps had no other choice.

After all, Dan Xin never forced them to do that.

Did it or not, that was their choice.

“What should we do?”

“Are we really going to mine Black Iron?”

“Let us mine Black Iron? How dare he dream up that, bastard!”

Complaints were heard everywhere in the camp of the Green Fire Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, am I not wrong? Dan Xin’s heart has been distorted over the years. He is crazy, a complete lunatic.”?Gu King’s voice rang out.?“I believe even if you really follow his instructions and obtain five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron, I am afraid you cannot get a chance to own the Dan Xin Palace either.”

“Yeah, I can figure out that.”?Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

From Dan Xin’s behaviors, he could tell that he was a lunatic.

When he heard the voice, he saw Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long, who were on good terms with him, walked toward him.
