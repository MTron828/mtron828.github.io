Chapter 1483: Receiving His Awards

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain had left the cave, Jian Wushuang did not stay on and he left the Sky Sword Mountain straight away.

“I have finally left the Sky Sword Mountain.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the giant Sky Sword Mountain behind him and he felt reluctant.

It should be known that he had been imprisoned in the Sky Sword prison for four thousand and four hundred years.

During Jian Wushuang’s training to date, this was the place that he had stayed for the longest period of time.

“I should send a message to Hall Master Yuan first,” Jian Wushuang took out Hall Master Yuan’s transmitting token.

However, when he looked at the token, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned strange.

From his point of view, he was a disciple of the Star Palace. In order to fulfill the Ultimate Disciple Task, he killed someone in the Sky Sword Mountain. Hence, he had broken the rules of the Sky Sword Mountain and was imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison by the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain himself. Such a matter must have reached the ears of the Lineage of Star by now.

Under normal circumstances, Hall Master Yuan would have shown himself and thought of ways to get Jian Wushuang out.

However, even though a total of four thousand years had passed, Jian Wushuang continued to remain in the Sky Sword Prison and, in the end, he had depended on his own abilities to get out.

Moreover, when he met the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain previously, he did not mention anything about it.

“Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang sent a message and he got a reply promptly.

“Jian Wushuang, you got out of the Sky Sword Prison so quickly?” Hall Master Yuan’s voice was filled with a bit of surprise, “Previously, I had thought that you would be able to get out within fifty thousand years. Looking at it now, I was too conservative. In less than five thousand years, you left the Sky Sword Prison with your own hard work.”

“The Sky Sword Prison is extremely dangerous. My luck must have been good as well. Otherwise, I might not have a chance to send a message to you again, Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha. It is obvious that you are trying to blame it on me. However, you must understand that the Sky Sword Mountain is not a small force. Moreover, you were imprisoned by the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain himself. In my Lineage of Star, the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain might only be willing to give some face if the Palace Master showed himself. However, the Palace Master is always meditating in seclusion throughout the year. You know this,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“All right, since you have come out, return back here and meet me so that you can receive the additional rewards for completing the Ultimate Disciple Task,” after finishing speaking, Hall Master Yuan cut off the transmission.

Jian Wushuang kept his token. However, his gaze was abnormal.

“Jian Wushuang, if my guess is not wrong, when Hall Master Yuan arranged the third part of your task, he had already guessed that you would be imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison. In other words, you could also say that he arranged for you to be imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“I have also thought of this point,” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

In actual fact, when he was just imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison, he had already had suspicions.

After all, back then when he was about to face Universe God Mo Yan, he had made ample preparations and the process had been executed perfectly.

Although those Real Gods near Universe God Mo Yan did not realize it, the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain, who was in a distant cave, had actually realized it and took action personally.

For this to happen, the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain must really possess remarkable powers. Even though he was meditating in seclusion, he still had everything that was going on in the Sky Sword Mountain in his eyes.

However, there was another possibility. And that was that the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain had had his eyes on the Sky Sword Mountain for that period of time. More accurately, he had his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“As long as I make a move, the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain will show up immediately and imprison me in the Sky Sword Prison,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and giggled.

Of course, he knew that Hall Master Yuan had done this to train him and it was out of good will.

Moreover, although he was imprisoned for over four thousand years in the Sky Sword Prison, in terms of abilities, he had improved greatly.

“Let’s return to the Lineage of Star.”

Jian Wushuang headed for the Purple Moon Sanctuary immediately.

…

Within the dazzling galaxy of the Star Land in the Purple Moon Sanctuary.

“I have returned.”

Jian Wushuang appeared in the vast galaxy. As he looked at the neighboring galaxies, he could also faintly see a Meta Beast playing in the galaxy from the corners of his eyes. Hence, he could not help but wear a smile.

In no time, Jian Wushuang returned to within the Lineage of Star. As soon as he had returned, he went to see Hall Master Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, after not seeing you for over four thousand years, your abilities must have risen considerably, right?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“About there,” Jian Wushuang said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I also know a bit about the rules of the Sky Sword Prison. Since you left the Sky Sword Prison with your own abilities, you must have killed a sufficient number of experts. Tell me, how many experts have you killed? Are they Universe Gods or Real Gods?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“I killed ten Real Gods,” Jian Wushuang did not hide the truth.

“Real Gods?” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes brightened. “Although the Real Gods in the Sky Sword Prison have their Divine Power restricted to some extent, their bodies and unique skills did not weaken. For you to be able to kill ten such Real Gods, haha, seems like you must possess the power to rank in the top thirty of the Universe God ranking list.”

“Should be,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

In actual fact, Hall Master Yuan only knew that he had killed ten Real Gods. However, he did not know that it was done in a very short period of time.

Moreover, among the ten Real Gods, some of them had already comprehended a small portion of the Power of Heaven Way and belonged to the second stage of Real Gods. In addition, Jian Wushuang’s power might even be able to rival that of the four Kings in the Sky Sword Prison.

For him to be able to do this much, Jian Wushuang’s abilities could totally earn him a place in the top twenty, or even higher, on the Universe God ranking list!

“All right. There is no need for unnecessary words. Now, I shall give you the additional rewards for completing the Ultimate Disciple Task,” Hall Master Yuan became stern.

“Firstly, the additional reward for the first part of the task, a hundred million Chaos Gems.”

“For these one hundred million Chaos Gems, due to the fact that you owe the Star Pavilion forty-seven million Chaos Gems, you will only receive fifty-three million Chaos Gems.”

Hall Master Yuan took out a Qian Kun Ring and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang received the ring, he swept his eyes past it normally and kept it after that.

Although fifty-three million Chaos Gems was not a small sum, to Jian Wushuang just then, it was not a lot.

It should be known that within the Sky Sword Prison, he had killed ten Real Gods. Among the ten Real Gods, there were weak ones as well as strong ones. By killing the Real Gods, all their valuables and family keepsakes had fallen into his hands. By adding all of them up, the Chaos Gems that he possessed had already exceeded a thousand million.

“For the second and third parts of the task, you have acquired the opportunity to enter the Real God Hall.”

“For the second part of the task, you are allowed to enter for a month. For the third part of the task, you are allowed to enter for two months. By adding them up, you are allowed to enter for a total of three months.”

“I have already sent a message to inform the deacon who is in charge of guarding the Real God Hall. You can go there directly,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Lastly, there is another additional reward… Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure!”
