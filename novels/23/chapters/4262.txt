4263 Closed-Door Cultivation for 60 Years

After Jian Wushuang’s finger touched the place between Divine Lord Xue Peng’s eyebrows, Divine Lord Xue Peng felt a huge pressure from Jian Wushuang’s finger. His legs went soft and he knelt down in front of Jian Wushuang with a plop.

“No…no, Lord Commander, I know I was wrong.” His throat kept rolling, and bean-sized beads of sweat dripped down his forehead.

“It’s too late.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head when he heard that. From his fingertips, sharp sword essence shot into Divine Lord Xue Peng’s divine body.

Bang!

An earth-shattering explosion rang out!

Immediately, Divine Lord Xue Peng’s body was crushed and there was no breath of life!

Apart from the people brought by Commander Mountain Shaker, the remaining dozens of Ultimate Rulers were all shocked as if they had seen a ghost, and their bodies trembled.

“This…what kind of heaven-defying combat strength is this?”

Everyone was terrified. Those who had provoked Jian Wushuang earlier were so frightened that they almost fell to the ground.

Naturally, no one who could make it to the last eight cities on the ancient path of starry sky was weak. In the outside world, they would be the proud sons of heaven in their respective sects and Holy Lands. As for Divine Lord Xue Peng, he dared to take the lead to stir up trouble because he was confident in his own strength. Among the dozens of Ultimate Rulers, he was considered one of the top experts.

In the end, such an expert had been killed by Jian Wushuang with just one finger?

Just how powerful was this Blood Sword?

Everyone did not dare to continue thinking.

As for the ten Ultimate Rulers that Commander Mountain Shaker had brought with him, they looked at each other and smiled. There was no surprise on their faces. Even Cang Feng, who was almost an unrivaled Ruler, had been killed by Jian Wushuang with three sword moves. Xue Peng was only a top expert among the Ultimate Rulers. How could he still be alive?

However, they had never expected that Jian Wushuang would kill Divine Lord Xue Peng with just one finger without even using his sword.

This raised Jian Wushuang’s status in their hearts to another level.

“Do you have any objections to me being the seventh commander?” Jian Wushuang stood with his hands behind his back. He glanced at the dozens of Rulers and said with a faint smile.

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare.”

The Rulers immediately shook their heads like rattle-drums.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang ignored them and slowly walked toward a wing room.

“Without my order, no one is allowed to come within thirty meters of this room.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the two wooden doors of the room opened automatically. Jian Wushuang stepped in and then closed the door tightly with a muffled bang.

…

…

Time passed and spring and autumn changed.

Sixty years passed.

Sixty years was already more than half of a mortal’s life, but to cultivators, it was just a snap of the fingers.

In the depths of the seventh commander’s manor, a muffled sound suddenly came from a side room that had been sealed for sixty years.

A black-robed, black-haired, cold-looking young man was sitting cross-legged in the room. His eyes were closed, and an ancient sword manual was placed in front of him.

The word ‘Tarot’ was carved into the sword manual. This was the famous Tarot sword manual from 300 chaos cycles ago! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, the black-haired young man slowly opened his eyes, which were filled with joy.

Although the sixty-year-long closed-door cultivation was not long, or rather, extremely short, it had helped Jian Wushuang improve greatly.

In the past sixty years, Jian Wushuang had not only repaired the Wuqi Divine Sword, but also refined the two venomous fangs into three drops of Supreme venom that could kill an unparalleled Ruler.

This meant that Jian Wushuang had one more trump card.

Once the three drops of venom were used at the right time, they could easily kill low-level invincible Rulers such as Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince. Jian Wushuang would then be able to get rid of the awkward situation where he could only kill invincible Rulers by relying on the sword technique ‘eternal night’.

Even the nine great overlords in the depths of the Ancient Path of Stars, the Rulers of the universe, would die to these three drops of poison if they were careless.

However, this was nothing to Jian Wushuang’s improvement.

Jian Wushuang’s greatest improvement in the sixty years was his sword principle!

After breaking through to the fourth level of sword principle origin, Jian Wushuang had not had the time to sort out his own sword principle origin.

In the past sixty years, Jian Wushuang had relied on the fourth level of the universe sword principle origin to not only sort out and deduce all the sword principle super powers he had learned along the way, but also to make up for the gaps and make the ‘star slashing’ sword move advance from the great completion to the completion!

Furthermore, he continued to study ‘eternal night’ and truly mastered it.

Jian Wushuang believed that once he used the ‘eternal night’, his power would increase by leaps and bounds!

Even the Ninth Kalpa King, who had been the number one master at the Ultimate Ruler of the universe, would have to avoid facing the current ‘eternal night’.

“It’s a pity that I still can’t comprehend the second move of the Tarot sword manual, daybreak.”

Jian Wushuang sighed. However, he also understood that the five super powers recorded in the Tarot sword canon were all Supreme unique skills. He was already very lucky to be able to comprehend ‘eternal night’. If he wanted to comprehend the other sword moves, he would have to at least reach the Ultimate Ruler realm to have a chance.

“However, this is already enough.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. He was now confident that if it was not for the presence of the unparalleled Ruler, ordinary Ultimate Rulers would not pose any threat to him. Even if it was an unparalleled Ruler, only the unparalleled Rulers of the Nine Magnates could make him fight with all he had.

“It’s about time to leave this place.” After thinking for a while, Jian Wushuang’s eyes began to flicker.

He had joined the Conqueror’s camp because he wanted to find a place to settle down and figure out the rules of the last eight cities. Now that he had almost completely figured out the situation, it was time to leave and find The Investiture of the Gods himself.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave, he received a message from Commander Mountain Shaker in his mind.

Commander Blood Sword, come to the Conqueror’s Divine Palace. Five Investiture of the Gods have been found in the sixteen cities!

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows when he heard the message.

Five God Sealing Tablets?

The God Sealing Tablet represented the qualification to participate in the Great Clan Gathering. The more God Sealing Tablets one obtained, the more likely one would be to enter the Great Clan Gathering and strive to become a child under that lord and have the qualification to listen to the Dao.

Now, more than half of The Investiture of the Gods had fallen into the hands of the Nine Magnates. There were only twenty to thirty Investiture of the Gods that had yet to appear.

This time, five Investiture of the Gods appeared at the same time, which was enough to shake the entire eight cities!

One must know that even the Nine Magnates only had ten pieces of the investiture tablet.

“Forget it, let’s just wait and see.”

Jian Wushuang made up his mind and immediately flew toward the Overlord Divine Palace.
