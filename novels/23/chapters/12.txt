Chapter 13: Trial Tower

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang walked out of the cultivating room and saw Elder Hong waiting outside.

“Hmm?” Seeing Jian Wushuang, Elder Hong could not refrain from showing astonishment. He felt that Jian Wushuang had changed a lot in terms of his strength.

Jian Wushuang did not voluntarily release his aura of Spiritual Power, so Elder Hong could not figure out his exact cultivation. However, he knew that Jian Wushuang must have made great progress in the cultivation room.

“It seems that our Young Pavillion Master has made big strides lately,” Elder Hong said smiling.

“Yeah.” Jian Wushuang nodded and asked, “Elder Hong, what’s the matter?”

“Here’s the thing,” Elder Hong replied. “The Trial Tower has opened again today. If you want to join the fight, you should try.”

“Trial Tower? ”

Jian Wushuang was intrigued by this information.

Trial Tower was a seven-story building made for testing cultivation and martial arts techniques. The higher the floor, the more difficult the test. It was usually closed, except for the month before the year-end battle each year. The Trial Tower test could be regarded as a preliminary battle.

After all, the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle was the most significant event in Sword Marquis Mansion. Every year, the Mansion would invite influential masters from within the Bashui Prefecture. To ensure a good performance for the masters, the participating disciples had to pass the Trial Tower in advance.

At a minimum, only disciples who had reached the fifth story, of the seven-story tower, were qualified to participate in the battle. Therefore, Jian Wushuang had to pass this test in the Trial Tower if he wanted to participate in the battle.

“I am leaving for Nine-wolves Mountain soon, and I will stay there for one month. Since I have to get the entry qualification for the battle, I have to take this chance at the Trial Tower and pass the test first.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

It would be a piece of cake for him to pass the Trial Tower test. Once he made up his mind, Jian Wushuang went directly to the Trial Tower.

Trial Tower stood erect in the very center of a huge courtyard; it was a gigantic tower, more than 33 meters high. At that moment, there were a lot of disciples in front of the huge tower.

“Look, the sixth gem has been lit! Cousin Jian Lin has passed the sixth story!”

“Cousin Jian Lin is really awesome! ”

“Hmm, how would you know? Cousin Jian Lin broke through the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path long ago. He has reached the peak of the Sixth Step. With his cultivation of spiritual power, it’s a cinch for him to pass the seventh story, never mind the sixth story. Look, the seventh gem has already been lit.”

Several disciples stared at the seven gems in front of the tower gate. Each gem corresponded to one story of the Trial Tower. After passing one story, a gem would be lit up. If all seven gems were lit up, it meant that all seven stories had been passed.

It must have been that Jian Lin, who had reached the peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, was going to pass all seven stories.

Soon after, the tower gate opened once again. The cyan-clothed Jian Lin walked out slowly, with a confident smile. Noticing the envious glances from the surrounding disciples, he was extremely proud of himself.

“Jian Lin has passed the seventh story. He is qualified to participate in the Sword Marquis Token Battle.” In front of the tower gate, an Elder from Red Martial Hall wrote his name down rapidly, and then looked around, saying “Next!”

Many disciples hesitated.

It was hard to pass the Trial Tower test. If one wanted to pass the fifth story, he needed to have a Spiritual Power Cultivation of the Fifth Step of Spirit Path. Moreover, if they wanted to take part in the battle, he had to be under sixteen.

In the Mansion, the number of disciples who could satisfy these two conditions was only modest. With so few qualifiers and so many bystanders, one would feel embarrassed, if they took the test but then failed to even pass the fifth story.

“Let me have a try.”

As a voice rose, a young figure slowly came over. He had a long sword behind his back.

Many disciples looked at him. They were astonished when they recognized him.

“Is it him?”

“Jian Wushang? ”

“Jian Wushuang of the Sword Pavilion, was he the one who just spoke?”

“How could he possibly pass the Trial Tower test?”

Everyone was in disbelief.

As the son of the last Sword Pavilion Master, Jian Wushuang had a special identity. Furthermore, he was universally recognized as trash in the Mansion, because he had not been able to gather Spiritual Power. Therefore, all the disciples in the Mansion knew him.

For this reason, they were extremely skeptical when he decided to attempt the test of the Trial Tower.

In addition to the disciples, the note-keeping Elder of Red Martial Hall could not help raising his head with surprise in his eyes, asking “You want to take the test in Trial Tower?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Can’t I?” Jian Wushuang looked indifferent.

“Of course, you can. As long as you are a disciple of the Mansion under 16.” The Elder nodded, saying, “Please go in.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang went directly into the tower, ignoring the multitude of eyes upon him.

Just as he ascended the steps, a voice that was obviously unfriendly rose from the side, “Jian Wushuang, how dare you come here to take the test? You overestimate yourself!”

Jian Wushuang paused and glanced coldly at Jian Lin, who glared at him with contempt. Without a word, he continued to walk toward the Trial Tower. Soon, he was inside the tower.

When he saw this, Jian Lin slightly turned the corner of his lips, “Hmph. Trash like you is so arrogant. Wait and see, you will be embarrassed later.”

“Cousin Jian Lin, do you think Jian Wushuang can pass the fifth story?” a disciple of Red Martial Hall asked.

“Him?” Jian Lin responded with a sneer, “To pass the fifth story one must have a cultivation of the Fifth Step of Spirit Path. He reached the Third Step of Spirit Path more than half a month ago. Now, he might have reached the Fourth Step of Spirit Path at most.”

“Even if he is the son of the last Sword Pavilion Master and possesses outstanding swordsmanship, it is still idiotic nonsense for him to pass the fifth story with a cultivation of the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path.”

The surrounding people all agreed with him.

More than half a month ago, he had just reached the Third Step of the Spirit Path. How strong could he be now?

He might have reached the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path at most. How could he possibly pass the fifth story in the Trial Tower? What a joke!

“Humph, he is asking for grief.” Jian Lin sneered. He expected that Jian Wushuang would disgrace himself in front of everyone.
