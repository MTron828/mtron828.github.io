Chapter 3534: Battle

However, facing the attacks of the surrounding people, Eight Axe Master merely smiled coldly. The huge axe in his hand suddenly drew a beautiful scar in the air, forming a huge axe shadow, it swept away the attacks of these Principles Masters with ease.

“So powerful!”

“We have so many people working together, yet he managed to sweep them away with a single axe?”

“He’s too powerful. We can’t stop him at all.”

The expressions of these Principles Masters were extremely unsightly. Their attacks were unable to stop Eight Axe Master, and they were not even able to obstruct Eight Axe Master. They could only watch as Eight Axe Master approached the Poluo God component.

Eight Axe Master appeared in front of the Poluo God component, and he waved his hand. He was about to put the Poluo God component into his interspatial ring. The surrounding Principles Masters all had helpless expressions on their faces.

But at this moment, a scarlet sword light suddenly lit up beside Eight Axe Master.

“What?” Eight Axe Master’s expression suddenly changed.

This sword light had appeared too suddenly, and its angle was extremely tricky. As soon as it lit up, it stabbed toward his throat.

Most importantly, that sword light was too fast, so fast that he could not swing his huge axe in time to block it. Moreover, this sword light contained an astonishing piercing power, which made his heart palpitate, he did not dare to face it with his godly body.

There was nothing he could do. Eight Axe Master could not be bothered to retrieve the Poluo God component anymore. Instead, he retreated hastily.

With this rapid retreat, he once again widened the distance between him and the Poluo God component. At this moment, a figure appeared beside the Poluo God component like a ghost. Then, with a simple wave of his hand…the Poluo God component had already fallen into his hands. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This sudden change caused the surrounding Principles Masters to be somewhat stupefied.

They had originally thought that no one present could stop Eight Axe Master, and that the Poluo God component was bound to fall into Eight Axe Master’s hands. “Search our n?wn0?el.?rg”Unexpectedly, at this crucial moment, someone had suddenly appeared beside Eight Axe Master, furthermore, he had forced Eight Axe Master to retreat, and he had obtained the Poluo God component.

The three most shocked ones were the Heavy Master, Saber Python Master, and Purple Sound Master.

They had clearly seen the other party’s appearance. It was Jian Wushuang, who had cast the spacetime domain behind them.

“It’s Blood Sword Master!”

“It’s him! Isn’t he behind us? When did he run to the Poluo God component?”

The Heavy Master, the Saber Python Master, and the Purple Sound Master could not help but turn around. They found that the void where Jian Wushuang was previously was empty. However, when did he leave for the Poluo God component, no one noticed him at all.

“The shadowless escape art at the exceptional level is very useful. Cultivators below the six realms of the void, as long as they are not particularly good at soul perception, can hardly detect my presence,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He had learned the shadowless escape art in the Temporal Temple. It originated from the Blood Sword Master, a very terrifying Principles Master in the Temporal Temple. When the Shadowless escape art was used, it could disappear without a trace, it could hide from the soul detection of a cultivator.

Jian Wushuang had mastered the Shadowless escape art long ago. He had not relied on it to kill or escape from enemies during battles on more than one occasion. For example, when he was adventuring in the blood wave realm, he had relied on the shadowless escape art, at that time, he was recognized as the best assassin at the Saint Level in the Divine Beginning Realm.

However, at that time, his mastery of the Shadowless escape art was still in the initial stage. Even if he had mastered it later, he could only hide it from the soul detection of some Principles Masters of the three or four void realms. However, not long ago, during the 600 years that Jian Wushuang had been in seclusion in the Star Palace, he had finally mastered the Shadowless escape art to the perfect level!

The shadowless escape skill at the perfection level was not much weaker than the Blood Sword Master at his peak. Under normal circumstances, only Principles Masters above the sixth realm of the void realm could sense it, or experts at the fifth realm of the void realm, who were particularly good at soul perception, could sense it.

Just now, when everyone was fighting for the Poluo God component, Jian Wushuang had actually moved. However, he had used the shadow escape skill to move forward, so no one noticed his existence.

It was not until Eight Axe Master approached the Poluo God component and was about to take it into his hands that he made his move decisively. He forced Eight Axe Master back and took the Poluo God component himself.

“I’m sorry to have wasted your time.” Jian Wushuang looked at everyone with a smile.

However, except for Heavy Master and the other two from the same camp, the other Principles Masters all looked at him with fierce eyes.

Especially Eight Axe Master, whose eyes were full of killing intent.

“How dare you snatch food from my mouth? You’re courting death!” Eight Axe Master growled. His aura suddenly soared, and in an instant, he charged toward Jian Wushuang like a furious beast.

Wherever he passed, the air was forced back by the overwhelming killing intent.

“Blood Sword Master, be careful!” Heavy Master shouted.

“Let’s go!” The Principles Masters from the other camps would not give up just like that. They charged forward one by one, but their target was no longer Eight Axe Master, it was Jian Wushuang instead.

“Quick, stop them!” Saber Python Master growled. In an instant, he joined hands with Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master to find a way to stop the Principles Masters around them. With their strength…with the help of the space-time domain, more than half of the Principles Masters around them were successfully stopped by them.

However, three people still broke through their obstruction, especially Eight Axe Master, who was in a rage. No one could stop him.

Seeing Eight Axe Master and the other two Principles Masters who had reached the fifth realm of the Void, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and disappeared in front of everyone.

“Disappeared?”

“Damn it, where did he go?”

The two Principles Masters of the fifth realm of the void looked gloomy. They scanned the surroundings with their soul power, but they could not find any trace of Jian Wushuang.

As for Eight Axe Master, he also released his soul power, trying to find Jian Wushuang, but he found nothing.

“Can he hide his special secret skill from soul detection?” Eight Axe Master’s face darkened. “No, it’s impossible for his secret skill to hide from the cultivator’s cultivation detection. The reason why I can’t find him is because my soul perception is not strong enough. In that case...”

Eight Axe Master was stunned. He flipped his hand and took out a purple bead.
