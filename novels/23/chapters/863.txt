Chapter 864: Kill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Under the cover of the endless gray fog, an intense battle was ensuing.

Jian Wushuang, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin worked together and made an all-out effort to attack.

Jian Wushuang drove the Blood Mountain Sword with all his strength, and from it, an extremely strong power burst out. His swordsmanship had been brought into full play, and it was either swift and violent or strange and cunning. He also tried to deploy his Mind-controlling Secret Skill, but it apparently had no effect on this burly man.

By virtue of the power of the Emperor Weapon, Jiu Zui fiercely slashed at the burly man’s weak points again and again with the long spear.

Ling Long brandished the Long Whip like a ferocious, vicious python, which greatly limited the burly man’s actions.

As for Shui Jin, he had deployed his Secret Skill which could quickly merge two doppelgangers, and he also spared no effort in the attack.

However, the four of them still couldn’t defeat the burly man in the least.

“His offensive power, speed, defense, and Saber Technique are all formidable. This guy is so fearsome!”

“I have never seen such a terrifying Eternal Realm expert.”

During the fighting, the four were all astonished by the strength that the burly man had shown.

They had long discovered that this burly man had not reached the level of Dao Master, but was merely at the Eternal Realm. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They, too, were all at the Eternal Realm. But this burly man was definitely the most terrifying because he was much stronger than any Eternal Realm expert they had seen.

“Ling Long, tie him up,” Jiu Zui suddenly roared.

“OK.” Ling Long nodded solemnly and a long whip appeared in her hand.

As Ling Long’s waved her hands, the two long whips violently bit at the burly man like two pythons.

Swish... the two pythons were restless and they seemed to want to entwine the burly man’s whole body. But he sensed it and a vast power suddenly burst out from his wide, thick broadsword, pushing the two long whips straight to the sides.

As the burly man parried Ling Long’s two long whips, Jiu Zui seized the opportunity to make his move.

A terrifying power gathered in his hands, and his eyes glistened with fury. His figure shook and he immediately appeared in front of the burly man, and the long spear in his hand slashed straight at him like lightning.

“Blood Shadow Heavenly Dragon, Kill!”

Jiu Zui roared.

This awesome shot was his strongest, and he had the utmost confidence in it.

Boom!

The void was slashed, forming a huge hole, and an invisible airstream filled the surroundings. Around the spear formed a huge corkscrew tunnel, and in the center of this tunnel burst out an extremely terrifying strong power.

“This is Jiu Zui’s strongest attack?” Jian Wushuang stared at it, and his eyes flashed with a hint of shock.

This attack was indeed powerful.

Even if Jian Wushuang had never personally experienced this power, he could easily guess its strength when he saw Jiu Zui slash.

“I don’t think you can still parry this shot.” Jiu Zui’s cold eyes locked tightly on the burly man in front of him.

The burly man reacted the moment Jiu Zui deployed his attack, and furiously slashed at Jiu Zui with his wide, thick broadsword.

The simple, straight slashing had such a strong power. It was easily able to split a mountain.

Bang!

A huge crash.

Jiu Zui’s body shook and he staggered backward for several steps.

The burly man was also forced to take several steps backward.

“How is it possible?” Jiu Zui was completely dumbstruck.

“This...” Ling Long and Shui Jin looking on also felt it was incredible.

Ling Long and Shui Jin knew very exactly how powerful Jiu Zui’s strongest attack was.

At the very least, the two of them didn’t dare to face this shot head-on.

Jiu Zui had used his strongest shot when he clashed with this burly man head-on, but... they actually came out even?

“He was only casually attacking?!” Ling Long marveled.

Was the burly man was actually this strong?

“Get out of the way!”

A cold roar suddenly resounded.

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all looked to their side.

The black-robed Jian Wushuang was standing in mid-air with cold eyes as dozens of longswords appeared beside him.

There were 36 longswords in total and each of them had an extremely strong aura. They did not reach the Emperor Weapon level, but they all were top Eternal Weapons.

Besides, these long swords were exactly the same in both shape and size.

“Merge!”

To the astonishment of the three people watching, the 36 longswords merged straight together at an amazing speed.

Instantly, a twenty-meter sharp scarlet longsword appeared in the fog sea.

As soon as the scarlet longsword appeared, a terrifying power was immediately emitted and ripples danced in the surrounding void.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed fiercely, and instantly the twenty-meter scarlet longsword flitted.

The scarlet longsword was too fast, so fast that, with their eyesight, Jiu Zui and the other two could barely see the blood shadow streak across the void.

The burly man also discovered this move that Jian Wushuang deployed, and naturally wanted to parry it the first time.

But the blood shadow was too fast!

A terrifying speed! It was fast to the extreme!

The burly man was still carefully trying to make out the trajectory of the blood shadow when, with a swish, his head flew straight off.

He was killed before he could offer any resistance.

This was the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, known as the strongest in the Eternal World.

The Traceless Sword Formation, the first sword formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, had a good speed.

The sword formation was so swift that none could catch a trace of it. It killed the opponent in the blink of an eye.

The burly man’s head flew off, and at long last, the void in the endless fog sea calmed down completely.

Jian Wushuang summoned the 36 Blood-sky Swords back and then appeared beside the burly man.

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all came up to the man. There was still a hint of amazement in their eyes as they stared down at the decapitated corpse.

“Is he dead?” Ling Long was the first to speak.

“He should be.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “When I chopped off his head, I planned to smash the Life Core in his body while I was at it. But I found there was no Life Core in his body. It seems he isn’t a normal Eternal Realm Human Warrior.”
