Chapter 952: Refuse To Yield

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Alive?” Jian Wushuang froze with disbelief.

“She is still alive. See for yourself.” Gu King cried at him.

His gaze turned instinctively towards Leng Rushuang who was gliding in the air not far away.

In her white flowing robes badly stained by blood, Leng Rushuang floated in the air silently. Layers of energy barriers encompassed around her. They were cast by Jian Wushuang during his battle with Xia Yong to prevent her from being struck by their blows.

But now that Jian Wushuang could look closely at her, he found that she was still alive.

Despite her frail and severely fragile aura, it was clear that she was hardly in mortal danger.

“She is really alive?” A manic joy gleamed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Hmph! She is the Great Primordial Sinner. Never will she perish so easily. But she would be, if you intend to dawdle any longer.” Gu King smirked, slightly peeved.

Jian Wushuang calmed himself. Leng Rushuang’s wellbeing would take precedence for now. The matter of Xia Yong would have to wait.

He flew to Leng Rushuang and cradled her in his arms.

“Into her body, Gu King. Heal her now.” Jian Wushuang urged.

The healing abilities of a Plenilune could restore the heal of not only itself and its host, but others as well.

It was during his time with the Ancient God Clan when the clansmen had allowed a Plenilune to enter his body and heal him.

“Into her? Nay. I may be willing to heal any other save for her. She is the Great Primordial Sinner. She bears the burden of heavy sacrilege. I might perish if I were to possess her.” Gu King explained exasperatedly before he continued. “Fret not. She will not die as long as I am present.”

This made Jian Wushuang felt better as he nodded wordlessly. He looked towards his Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

Xue Lingtian had earlier been injured when he had tried to help Jian Wushuang. But still, his wounds were hardly serious for he was already back on his feet to begin healing himself.

“All is well. Senior Brother is safe.” Jian Wushuang exhaled in relief.

He would be blaming himself for eternity if Leng Rushuang and his Senior Brother were to have given their lives for him.

Jian Wushuang then turned and looked around the chaos surrounding him.

At some distance away from him, King Gu Tong was still fighting ferociously against the National Master that none could tell who was gaining the upper hand. But the battle waging around them was reaching its conclusion.

The factions led by Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan had assumed that victory would be theirs since Xia Yong had joined the battle. But never had they expected that the great and powerful Xia Yong would have fallen so ignominiously in the hands of Jian Wushuang, a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm.

Instead, the tide of battle had tipped against their favor, with only Emperor Leng, Xia Tao, Xia Ming and few other warriors holding their front line. Still, defeat seemed inevitable.

“How could this be?”

“Why is the situation so dire? This is impossible!”

The eyes of Emperor Leng burned red as all vestiges of composure had all but left her. Her eyes studied frantically the battle raging around her as she fought, but she could hardly suppress the dread and anxiety rising in her mind.

The shame was simply impossible for her to stomach!

“For many years I have prepared and planned only for this moment! I simply refuse to be thwarted here!”

“Never! I refuse to yield to this Emperor Xiao!”

“National Master! National Master!”

Emperor Leng howled maniacally suddenly, a shrilling cry that resounded so greatly that everyone stopped in their tracks to look at her.

Farthest away, King Gu Tong was still exchanging blows furiously against the soothsayer.

As a Seven-star Imperial God, King Gu Tong still wielded powerful strength of his own, even if his power was but a mere fraction of what it was before. Moreover, King Gu Tong had a plethora of Ancient God Secret Skills at his disposal which made him an extraordinarily dangerous foe.

The soothsayer was hardly a match for one so powerful and dangerous like King Gu Tong. But he had the Blood-killing Plate Armor which had given him an edge against his opponent.

The overall strength of them both were so great that they had exceeded the levels of Dao Master.

Their battle was equally gritting and fierce that not even Jian Wushuang’s defeat of Xia Yong could match its intensity and brutality.

No one dared to approach them for fear of being caught between their blows that a ring of desolation and barrenness spanning thousands of kilometers surrounded them.

The wailing shrieks of Emperor Leng reached to them, rousing the soothsayer from his bloodlust frenzy.

“Xia Yong had lost to a young pup!?”

“Hopeless filth!”

The soothsayer cursed from his heart.

In a fleeting moment of consciousness, King Gu Tong stole a glance at Jian Wushuang. The ends of his lips curled into an encouraging smile. “This fledgling has done well indeed. To think that he bears the Imperial Bloodline as well.”

“Think of something, National Master! We cannot lose!” Emperor Leng’s frantic cries resounded from afar once more.

“Think of something?” The soothsayer turned dismal and sullen as he raked his mind for solutions in the midst of the savage duel against his foe. Suddenly his eyes twinkled and he sent a silent message via telepathy to Emperor Leng. “Quick! Activate the formation!”

“The formation? Now?” The emperor stammered with doubt. “But I am not ready!”

“We can afford to wait no more. You will still be able to regain some advantage even if you are not ready. Otherwise, all is lost and all our efforts will be for naught!” The soothsayer urged and screamed. “No more doubts! Quick!”

Emperor Leng could only frown with a throbbing anxiety.

A strong and stout woman who had endured countless trials and tribulations to seize power as an empress of a strong empire, she was hardly an indecisive and tentative person.

With a few calculations, she swiftly came to a decision.

“Very well,?I will activate the formation now!” Emperor Leng responded to him telepathically.

“It should be so.” The soothsayer replied approvingly with a wicked grin.

At the other side of the battlefield, Emperor Leng was still defending herself against the unforgiving blows of Emperor Xiao. She leaped backward and fled, stopping halfway in mid-air after flying for some time.

“Are you ready, Xia Yong?” Emperor Leng shot a glance at the pale and crippled Xia Yong.

From behind the backs of his kinsmen protecting him, Xia Yong heard the call of the empress. His lips twitched with anticipation.

“Is it time finally?” Xia Yong’s expression turned dark and cruel, his eyes sparkled with apprehension. “I may be weakened and the preparations are not yet complete, but I do not think we can wait any longer. We must strike now!”

“Begin the sequence.”

Xia Yong responded her call and his body began to convulse violently.

High above in the air, Emperor Leng’s face became intense as many Dao Masters around her had their sights set upon her. With a flick of her wrist, a golden token appeared in her hand.

A strange and unusual aura permeated from the token.

Emperor Leng steeled herself with renewed resolve, with her teeth gritted, she crushed the token in her hand!.
