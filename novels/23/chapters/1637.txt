Chapter 1638: Breakthrough, Ultimate Real God!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Breakthrough. It was naturally a breakthrough to become a Real God!

For the four requirements that one needed to fulfill to make a breakthrough to become a Real God, Jian Wushuang had achieved the first three when he was in the human beings’ territory.

The only remaining requirement was the last one, which was the opportunity to make a breakthrough.

The opportunity to make a breakthrough was vague and Jian Wushuang did not know when it would be or under what circumstances would it come.

He had already accepted that fact and he decided to go with the flow.

However, what he absolutely did not expect was that the opportunity to make a breakthrough would actually come so quickly and suddenly.

“This opportunity is extremely rare. If I were to miss it, I would have no idea how much longer I would need to wait for the next one. Moreover, this opportunity might not ever come again. No matter what, I have to make a breakthrough to Real God this time round,” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly. After that, with a thought, elixirs appeared in front of him immediately.

Those elixirs were prepared beforehand for him to make a breakthrough to Real God. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He was different from Duan Lingfeng.

When Duan Lingfeng made a breakthrough to Real God in the Burning Demon Region back then, it had actually occurred very suddenly. Moreover, it had occurred when he was in danger and he did not make any preparations for it.

However, Jian Wushuang had made ample preparations a long time ago.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and his vigorous Divine Power started to rise from his body.

The whole secret room became silent and only the slight noise generated from the rising Divine Power remained.

Time passed by…

In a flash, two hundred years had passed.

Within a lofty hall in the Ancient God Palace.

“Gu Yi.”

A stalwart body appeared in front of King Gu Yi abruptly.

King Gu Yi, who was browsing through a bamboo strip, raised his head. When he saw the approaching person, he stood up immediately. At the same time, he revealed a modest expression, “Lord Gu Tong.”

“I have told you many times. As you are also a Seven-star Royal Ancient God now, your realm is similar to mine and there is no need for you to call me Lord. Moreover, I have still not completely gotten rid of the sinister power within my body. Thus, by comparing abilities, I am very inferior to you,” King Gu Tong said.

“Both you and Lord Gu You have always been existences that I revered,” King Gu Yi still did not change his tone.

It should be known that a very long time ago, when King Gu Tong and King Gu You were fighting for the right to rule the Gu King City, Gu Yi was merely a little kid who was only a Five-star Ancient God. Moreover, at that time, he was under King Gu Tong’s sect and he saw King Gu Tong as his idol.

Even though many years had passed and his abilities had achieved the same level as King Gu Tong’s, he was still extremely respectful to King Gu Tong.

“I will leave it to you to do what you want.” King Gu Tong did not say much. “This time around, I have come to ask about the training progress of that little kid who is under me.”

“Lord, you can set your mind at ease. Those little kids are not too bad and they have already obtained all the rights to comprehend the Four Unique Skills. In particular, Gu Heng, who is the most outstanding person, has already obtained all the rights to inherit the Secret Skill, Thunder Attracting Skill,” King Gu Yi said.

The Ancient Gods within the Ancient God Palace will all be introduced to the Four Unique Skills step by step. As for the Three Secret Skills, they will need to fulfill certain requirements before they are able to inherit them.

They were unlike Jian Wushuang, who could inherit the Four Unique Skills and Two Secret Skills straight away after clearing the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower.

“Oh right. What about Jian Wushuang? I am referring to Gu Jian,” King Gu Tong asked again.

“Gu Jian is a true genius. For the past few years, his speed of improvement in the Ancient God Palace has been very shocking. He has grasped the Four Unique Skills so well that they have achieved a very high level. Moreover, his two Secret Skills have also achieved quite a high level. In addition, two hundred years ago, he secluded himself in training in a secret room,” King Gu Yi said.

“Secluded himself in training?” King Gu Tong’s expression changed.

“From what I know, at the start, Jian Wushuang was still having a very good conversion with one of my clansmen. However, all of a sudden, he went to seclude himself in training. If I am not wrong, he has probably found an opportunity to make a breakthrough and he is about to make a breakthrough soon,” King Gu Yi said.

“Oh?” King Gu Tong could not help but laugh, “He is going to make a breakthrough to Six-star Ancient God in such a short amount of time?”

“This little kid…”

Within the secret room.

Jian Wushuang was still sitting down with his legs crossed and there were some droplets of sweat on his forehead.

“Break! Break! Break!”

Jian Wushuang shouted continuously and the great amount of Divine Power which had accumulated in his body was striking a barrier repeatedly.

At the same time, his hands were holding the Blood Mountain Sword tightly. When he swung his sword toward the void repeatedly, a huge amount of sword essence appeared.

In order to make a breakthrough to Real God, he needed to surpass his own limits forcefully.

This step was extremely difficult and the time taken for the process would also be exceptionally long.

Under normal circumstances, the shortest time required for a Universe God to make a breakthrough to Real God was tens of years, while the longest time was hundreds of years.

Moreover, as an Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang’s process of making a breakthrough would be even longer and he had already used a total of two hundred years.

At that moment…

“Boom!”

Jian Wushuang’s body shook violently. He had finally broken through his limits.

An enormous amount of Divine Power was revolving within his body madly and in an instant, it started to undergo a transformation.

Such a transformation was strange.

It was not just a transformation in terms of quality. The most important thing was that all the Divine Power in his body was actually gathering at one point madly.

In the end, the vast sea of Divine Power completely changed into a golden water droplet.

The golden water droplet was the size of the fist of a baby and it contained Divine Power that was many times stronger than the Divine Power Jian Wushuang possessed when he was still a Universe God!

“Ultimate Divine Power!”

“I have achieved the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes fiercely. His eyes were glowing extremely brilliantly and he was over the moon.

An Inverse Cultivator was completely different from a normal cultivator.

When a normal cultivator made a breakthrough from Universe God to Real God, his Divine Power and body would change in terms of quality. Hence, his abilities as a whole could rise considerably.

As for an Inverse Cultivator, when he made a breakthrough from Universe God to Real God, he would enter the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength from the Fifth Step of Cultivation Strength!

As for the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength, it was… an Ultimate Real God!

Similarly, Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power and body would become more powerful upon entering this step. However, what was different was that Jian Wushuang would possess the Ultimate Divine Power and Ultimate Body!

The Ultimate Divine Power was the golden water droplet which had formed inside Jian Wushuang’s body.

“This Divine Power…”

Jian Wushuang was feeling the golden water droplet within his body. At the next moment, when his wrist moved, the golden water droplet released some golden Divine Power immediately.

Rustle~~~

The void in the whole secret room was torn into pieces instantly.

“It’s too strong. This is too strong!” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide.

Although Jian Wushuang already had some knowledge about the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength and the Ultimate Divine Power, he still could not help but be shocked.

“If I am not wrong, my current Divine Power is so powerful that it can rival a Chaotic Real God’s!”

Chaotic Real God!

That’s right. The Divine Power and body of the current Jian Wushuang had achieved the level of a Chaotic Real God!

It must be known that Jian Wushuang had only just become an Ultimate Real God and he was a Stage One Ultimate Real God, which was equivalent to a Void Real God of a normal cultivator. However, his Divine Power and body had already achieved the level of a Chaotic Real God.

In the future, if he were to become a Stage Two Ultimate Real God, his Divine Power and body would be… at the level of a normal Almighty!

At Stage Three, his Divine Power and body would be comparable to top Almighties, like the Star Palace Master and an Eight-star Ancient God!

In other words, if his Unique Skills, Secret Skills, comprehension of the Heaven Way as well as other techniques were able to catch up to his realm, he would be able to achieve a very high level that was similar to the Star Palace Master, even though he was still in the realm of a Real God!

That was the Sixth Step of an Inverse Cultivator… Ultimate Real God!
