“Vice Palace Master Ling Yu, according to you, my Ancient Sect possesses the techniques of the first four levels of the Ancient God Secret Skill. But why have I never seen them in the Secret Skill pavilion, nor seen experts from my sect displaying them?” Liu Chong asked, frowning.

The others nodded their heads in agreement.

If the Ancient Sect indeed possessed these techniques, then surely they would have been given to the disciples to cultivate. Yet, nobody had heard of any disciple cultivating the Secret Skill, which could boost one’s offensive power by up to 12 times.

“Let me refer to the opportunity I just mentioned – the Demon God Essence Blood,” Ling Yu began to explain.

“The Ancient God Secret Skill originated from the Demon God Clan, and that’s why even though it’s powerful, it’s apparently only suitable for the Demon God clansmen to cultivate. For us human warriors to cultivate this Secret Skill, we have to consume Demon God Essence Blood!”

“By consuming Demon God Essence Blood, we gain the trace of Demon God bloodline it contains which will enable us to cultivate the Ancient God Secret Skill. More Demon God Essence Blood will be needed to cultivate the Ancient God Secret Skill to the highest level.”

“Under normal circumstances, the first four levels of the Ancient God Secret Skill will only require 10 drops of Demon God Essence Blood to cultivate. But it ain’t simple to obtain the Essence Blood, for Demon Gods have to be hunted down and killed. That’s why few in the Firmament Territory have truly been able to cultivate up to the fourth level.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang and co. began to understand.

According to the Vice Palace Master, killing one Copper-armored Demon God would grant only one drop of Demon God Essence Blood, which meant that 10 of them would have to be killed to obtain 10 drops. However, these Demon Gods are powerful and certainly not easy to kill.

“Apart from being a requirement for the cultivation of the Ancient God Secret Skill, consuming the Demon God Essence Blood will greatly strengthen one’s body. After all, the Demon God clansmen’s strongest aspect is their bodies. The more Essence Blood absorbed, the more powerful one’s body will become,” Ling Yu said.

Jian Wushuang and co. nodded silently.

They finally understood the true uses of the Demon God Essence Blood.

The first was to cultivate the Ancient God Secret Skill, while the second was to strengthen their bodies.

“The last thing I have to tell you about is the third greatest opportunity in the Eternal Zone – the Demon God Baptismal Pool, which also originates from the Demon God Clan,” Ling Yu continued, “However, it’s useless to y’all for the time being and cannot be obtained in the outer layer, and so I shan’t elaborate on it.”

“All in all, during your future adventures in the outer layer of the Eternal Zone, try your best to hunt down and kill Demon Gods, and find ways to obtain as much Demon God Essence Blood as possible. It’s the only opportunity you can obtain in the outer layer.”

Feng, Liu Chong, and the others nodded upon hearing this.

Though only the Demon God Essence Blood was obtainable, it would be of an astonishing benefit to them and was indeed a great opportunity.

But Jian Wushuang could not help frowning.

“Based on what Vice Palace Master Ling Yu said, the Eternal Zone is the Demon God Clan’s home, where they’ve always lived and never been oppressive toward human warriors in any way. Yet, because of the great attraction that their Essence Blood and Ancient God Secret Skill pose for human warriors, the various sects of the Firmament Territory, upon the opening of the Eternal Zone every hundred years, would charge in and hunt down these Demon Gods. This is what has been going on…”

Though the Demon God clansmen could not be considered humans, they were also earthly creatures after all.

Furthermore, what separated them from demonic and spirit beasts was the fact that they had always lived in their own home without ever antagonizing human warriors.

Jian Wushuang was by no means a kind person. On the contrary, a countless number of people have already died at his hands ever since he began his cultivation.

His actions had all along been dictated by what his heart fancied.

He was now somewhat displeased and even disgusted by the actions of the various sects of the Firmament Territory, yet ironically, he was among the people who would enter the Eternal Zone this time.

“There’s no hurry. Let’s go to the Eternal Zone and see how the Demon God clansmen are like first. If they’re of an evil and cruel nature, I’ll be fine with killing them. But if that’s not the case… we shall see,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The party continued on their journey for some time and only stopped when they arrived in an ancient forest.

In the middle of this ancient forest, there were many figures already in wait. These were the experts and disciples from the other top sects who had arrived long before.

Every time the Eternal Zone opened, the top sects were each allowed to send in six disciples, while the three magnates were each allowed 10 disciples.

Though there was a quota imposed on disciples, there was no such limit on the experts who had attained the Eternal Realm.

Regardless of which sect they were from, an Eternal Realm expert could enter the Eternal Zone so long as they wished to. That was why an extremely large number of experts entered the Eternal Zone every time it opened.

There were eight Eternal Realm experts from the Ancient Sect alone, while the other top sects, particular the three magnates, provided similar numbers.

The overall strength and class of the three magnates were comfortably superior to those of the other top sects.

Take the Ancient Sect for instance – its total number of Eternal Realm experts did not exceed 20. By contrast, each of the three magnates had more than 40 Eternal Realm experts, more than twice what the Ancient Sect had.

Naturally, the more Eternal Realm experts a sect possessed, the more experts it would send to venture into the Eternal Zone.

There were hence a dozen or more Eternal Realm experts sent by each of the three magnates.

The many Eternal Realm experts and the Divine Realm disciples were gathered together, silently watching their surroundings.

Jian Wushuang too began to look around, sweeping his gaze across the experts and disciples sent by the three magnates. As he did so, he could sense many veiled gazes directed back at him.

Many of these gazes came from people of the other top sects.

“It seems that I’m still kinda popular.”

Smiling faintly, he nevertheless remained on high vigilance. He could discern that some of these gazes harbored malintent, and most crucially, there were a few among them who were very powerful and could be considered a threat to him.

“Wu Dao, Dao Mei, and Xue Guzi, why these peeps? What madness is this from the Cloud Sea Asgard?” Liu Chong suddenly exclaimed.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang and co. peered sideways at Liu Chong.

“Look, among the Cloud Sea Asgard’s 10 disciples, there are three of them whose auras are extremely powerful and who have already attained the superior Divine Realm level,” Liu Chong lowered his voice and spoke.
