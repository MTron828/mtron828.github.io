Chapter 4008: One Person Suppressed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Don’t you think you’ve gone too far?” The five-meter-tall holy woman said in a cold voice that echoed in the universe.

“Gone too far? Haha, you Ancient Yuan Star people know that I’m on the universe boat, but you still dare to rob me. You must have expected such consequences.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “Besides, as long as you give me a satisfactory explanation, it’s already very polite that you didn’t directly destroy your Ancient Yuan Star.”

“In that case, as the great leader, it seems that I have to personally experience your methods.” The holy woman’s eyes were cold, and a cyan longsword appeared in her hand.

This holy woman was obviously a sword principle cultivator.

However, although she was a fourth-level Ruler and the great leader of Ancient Yuan Star, she did not have a principle supreme treasure in her hand. The divine sword she took out was only a supreme treasure divine sword.

Seeing the holy woman take out the divine sword, Jian Wushuang still looked at her with a smile.

“Humph, I want to see how you dare to ask me, Ancient Yuan Star, to give you an explanation.” The holy woman let out a low shout, and the holy aura on her body suddenly soared.

Buzz! A resplendent holy light rose up.

The entire universe was dyed white by this holy light, and this holy woman was like a goddess who had descended from the sky. However, this goddess held a long sword in her hand, and her eyes were filled with shocking ruthlessness, she was a war goddess.

The holy woman’s divine body suddenly expanded. Originally, she was only five meters tall, but in the blink of an eye, she suddenly expanded to several hundred meters tall. The divine sword in her hand also expanded infinitely, and then she waved her jade-like hand.

Whoosh!

A mighty and holy sword light suddenly slashed down.

The sword light seemed to be able to split the surrounding galaxy, and it was extremely powerful.

“Yes, this sword alone has the battle strength of the fourth level, and it is definitely not an ordinary battle strength of the fourth level. It has reached the upper level, and it should be very powerful among the advanced Rulers of the fourth level.” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

The holy woman was able to create a star island force like the Ancient Yuan Star, and she was able to survive in the Purple Micro Galaxy for a long time. Her strength was indeed extraordinary.

However, the holy woman’s strength was much weaker than that of Devil Cloud Star Master, who had killed her way to the Divine Beginning Realm.

After all, although Devil Cloud Star Master had just broken through to the fourth-level, he had a principle supreme treasure and had comprehended a trace of the universe principle. His battle strength was almost at the peak of the fourth-level.

However, even Devil Cloud Star Master, who was at his peak, could be easily killed after Jian Wushuang broke through to become a Ruler. Not to mention that he now controlled the will of Heavenly Dao in the Divine Beginning Realm. With the help of the will of Heavenly Dao…after tens of thousands of years of meditation and cultivation, his strength had long reached a new level. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Take my sword.”

Jian Wushuang also took out the Wuqi divine sword and waved it.

He did not even use the universe principles. He just used his comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle and the new power of his will.

Although Jian Wushuang was only a second-level Ruler, his divine power was no weaker than a third-level Ruler because of his perfect life, in addition, the power of his will, which was granted by the universal principle, was ten times stronger than that of a fourth-level Ruler.

In other words, in terms of divine power, he was the same as the holy woman. The only difference was his swordsmanship and his comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle.

Whoosh!

The sword light was not dazzling, but the moment the sword light flew out.

A suffocating murderous aura rose out of thin air. In the eyes of the holy woman, Jian Wushuang’s casual move seemed to represent the complete sword principle.

The rich universe origin of sword principle filled the entire world, making the entire universe void seem to be twisted into a huge sea of sword principle.

Even the sword shadow that she used was greatly affected at this moment.

“How is this possible?” Holy woman was shocked.

Her opponent’s attack had not collided with her, but she still felt that her swordsmanship was falling apart.

It was purely affected by the sword essence.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang’s sword light finally swept over. In just a moment, it completely crushed the holy woman’s mighty sword light.

The holy light in the surroundings immediately dimmed.

The holy woman’s divine body returned to five meters tall, and she was forced to retreat backward. It took her a great deal of effort to regain her balance.

The holy woman’s eyes were filled with astonishment.

“What a terrifying, terrifying sword!”

“His divine power is almost the same, and his sword is not a world-shaking sword skill. However, the sword essence contained in his sword skill is incredible. How could the sword essence directly affect my sword skill?”

“His understanding of sword principle is incredible. His understanding of the universe origin of sword principle is far better than mine. It’s even better than all the experts of sword principle that I’ve fought before. It’s too terrifying!

“Holy woman!”

The holy woman stared at Jian Wushuang in horror.

They were both experts in sword principle. When the holy woman had just fought with Jian Wushuang, she had already seen the unbridgeable gap between her and his understanding of sword principle.

According to her estimation, although the Master of the universe boat was only a second-level master, his comprehension of sword principle far exceeded that of a fourth-level master. Perhaps even among the fifth-level masters…there were few who could match up to him.

His understanding of sword principle origin was too high.

“Sir, this matter is all my fault. I, Ancient Yuan Star, am willing to give you an explanation and pay a price to appease your anger,” the holy woman quickly said.

As soon as she said this, Ancient Yuan Star was instantly shocked and in an uproar.

However, everyone immediately felt relieved.

The experts of Ancient Yuan Star were not fools. They had seen the scene just now. It was obvious that their great leader was also no match for him. In fact, the other party was much stronger than their great leader, they were on two completely different levels.

Such an expert was not someone that Ancient Yuan Star could afford to provoke.

Hence, at this moment, they could not care less about their reputation. Instead, they had to think of ways to appease the other party’s anger.

Otherwise, the other party alone could directly wipe out their Ancient Yuan Star.
