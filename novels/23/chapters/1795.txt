Chapter 1796: Devil Church’s Lair

In a day’s time, Jian Wushuang went to a few places and killed a total of seven Blood Devils.

The experts from Green Fire Palace were even more astonished.

One should know that a day’s time… To them, it wasn’t even enough for them to rush their journey, let alone kill the Blood Devils.

“Next, is to Devil Church’s lair,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold.

According to the information that Green Fire Palace had found, the remaining six Blood Devils from Devil Church were in the lair.

Jian Wushuang then led the experts from Green Fire Palace to Devil Church’s lair.

Devil Church’s lair was originally in Tang of the East, the imperial city in Tang of the East.

“Old Three, that’s where Devil Church’s lair is at.”

Wang Yuan pointed at a huge city engulfed in a crimson fog in front, “It was originally the imperial city in Tang of the East but it was renamed to Devil City. Theoretically, Devil City has Blood Devils attending to garrison duty personally so there is no one from Green Fire World that dares to act wildly here. However, somehow or other, the thirteen Blood Devils from Devil Church still joined forces to set up a huge formation in the city. The power of the formation is impressive.”

“Is it?” Jian Wushuang looked calm. He glanced at Devil City then he raised his palm and pointed at Devil City from afar.

He pointed…

Hong!

The huge formation that covered Devil City instantly cracked without any struggle.

The formation broke and the experts from Devil Church in Devil City were immediately startled. Countless figures soared into the air.

Those leading were of course the remaining six Blood Devils.

“B*stard!”

“Green Fire Palace, how dare you!”

The six Blood Devils were angry and they let out roars.

But very soon, their attentions were caught by the person in front of the people from Green Fire Palace.

“This person…”

The six Blood Devils exchanged a look and they were surprised.

The six of them were the higher-ranked among the Blood Devils. Among the six of them, there were three who had already reached the level of Chaotic Real God. But they couldn’t see through Jian Wushuang’s aura?

They could feel that Jian Wushuang was powerful but they couldn’t tell which level Jian Wushuang was at.

“Hey, who are you?” A bald man among the six Blood Devils asked in a deep voice.

The bald man was the number one boss among the thirteen Blood Devils.

“Green Fire Palace, Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“It’s you?” The six Blood Devils were surprised and they had obviously heard of Jian Wushuang before.

“Humph, I never expected you to return from Eternal Chaotic World,” the bald man smirked coldly. “Jian Wushuang, I think you are a genius. Why did you return when you were doing so well in Eternal Chaotic World?”

“I came back to take revenge,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. He then waved and there were heads that were thrown out. “There were Thirteen Blood Devils and I have killed seven. Now, there are only six of you left.”

Looking at the heads floating in the void, the six Blood Devils who were originally calm were raging.

“B*stard, how dare you kill our brothers?!” The bad man was angry.

“Not only them, but all of you also have to die,” Jian Wushuang looked expressionless. A simple reply seemed to have announced a death sentence for the six of them.

“Humph, Don’t think you are unmatched after you killed my seven brothers. Today, I will turn Green Fire Palace into a bloodbath and take revenge on the behalf of my seven brothers!” The bald man let out a cold humph, “Let’s do this together and kill him!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Six fierce auras instantly exploded.

Any one of the six auras could make countless experts from Green Fire Palace feel hopeless.

However, to Jian Wushuang, they were too weak.

“Die!”

With just one word, it wasn’t the pressure of divine might but five fine sword intentions that appeared in front of him.

The five fine sword intentions swept out and the speed was so fast that the few Real Gods couldn’t even see the shadow.

Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!

Five sword lights pierced the eyebrows of five Blood Devils. Instantly, there were five bodies falling.

The six Blood Devils were soaring with rage and wanted to attack Jian Wushuang but there were five of them that died instantly and only the bald man was left standing there.

“How… how is it possible?”

The bald man’s eyes were wide and he looked at Jian Wushuang with a horrified look. It was as though he had seen a ghost.

It stirred billowing waves in the bottom of his heart.

He had heard about Jian Wushuang before and he knew about Jian Wushuang’s outstanding achievements.

Even though Jian Wushuang had once brought about a radical change in the war against Jin Kingdom, Jian Wushuang was nothing in his eyes. Because Jian Wushuang had only been a Universe God then and he was already a Real God, a Chaotic Real God. He had thought killing a Universe God was as easy as killing an ant.

Hence, he didn’t care about Jian Wushuang at all in the beginning.

Even when Jian Wushuang had returned, he had reckoned that Jian Wushuang was only slightly bigger than an ant and he didn’t care.

But who would have guessed that Jian Wushuang had become so ferocious!

He had become so powerful!

The thirteen Blood Devils were like babies before Jian Wushuang.

“Do you know why I didn’t kill you?” Jian Wushuang took one step forward and stood ten meters before the bald man. His cold gaze fixed onto the bald man and he was looking at him as though he was looking at an ant. No, even worse than an ant.

“Why, why?” The bald man stuttered.

“Because I don’t want you to die so easily,” Jian Wushuang said coldly, “Back when you thirteen Blood Devils destroyed Tang of the East, you were the one who killed the higher-ups of Tang of the East, right? You did it personally, right?”

“I, I…” The bald man stuttered and he was at a loss for words.

“Do you know that among the people that you killed, there was my benefactor, my wife’s father, and… my brother!” Jian Wushuang uttered every word clearly and there was boundless rage and hatred in his eyes.

Old Two Yang Zaixuan, Emperor Tang, Emperor Xiao, which one of them were not related to him? They had died because of the thirteen Blood Devils, because of nonentity-like people.

“For them, I will not let you die so quickly. I have to torture you for a thousand years – no, for ten thousand years. I want you to live in complete agony!”

“Try this.”

Jian Wushuang said and there was crimson light that burst out of his eyes.

The crimson light was brilliant and it looked just like a crimson sun. The moment the bald man saw the crimson light, he was dumbfounded.

Suddenly… Rumble.

A boundless prison engulfed him.

Secret skill of soul attack, Eighteen Asura Hell, descended!
