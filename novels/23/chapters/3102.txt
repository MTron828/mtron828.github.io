Chapter 3103: Easy Mission

——

After leaving the Heaven-cleaving Star, Jian Wushuang returned to the First Heaven, but his mood was quite heavy.

“The Supreme Emotion Valley is extremely powerful. If I want to take Shuang Er away, I need to have the strength of the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. But I’m still far from that level!”

“My strength is still too weak after all!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly. It took him a long time to calm down.

“The trip to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm not only allowed me to obtain the secret skill ‘six paths of reincarnation’, but also increased my strength greatly. I’ve reached the level of a rank three True Saint and made so many breakthroughs in my realm. Then my strength should be in a leap period now,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Previously, he was only a first-level True Saint. But whether it was his comprehension of the principles, understanding of the Dao, or even in the absolute arts, he was far beyond his realm. Because he was far beyond his realm…it caused his improvement speed to become slower and slower.

For example, when the water in the water bottle was full, it was naturally impossible to continue filling it.

However, it would be completely different if he replaced it with a big water bottle.

Once Jian Wushuang broke through his realm and broke through two realms at the same time, his comprehension of the principles and Dao would naturally have a lot of room for improvement. Moreover, he had just broken through, so the improvement was usually very fast, that was why it was called the leap period.

“Now I can find a place to concentrate on improving my strength. It would be best if I have some proper training.” Jian Wushuang smiled and suddenly, his expression changed. “It’s been a long time since I’ve completed a mission of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Let’s go and take a look.”

Jian Wushuang immediately set off.

The secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was located in every corner of the Divine Beginning World. Naturally, there were many in the First Heaven. Jian Wushuang easily found one of the secret lairs.

In the secret lairs, Jian Wushuang sat alone at the table with a list of heaven-level missions in his hand. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were countless heaven-level tasks on the list!

“It’s no wonder that there are so many heaven-level tasks in the First Heaven.” Jian Wushuang sighed and began to read carefully.

One heaven-level task after another passed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

These heaven-level tasks varied in difficulty from one star to three stars, so the rewards were naturally different.

Jian Wushuang carefully searched for nearly an hour on this list of missions and finally found a mission that was more suitable for him.

This mission was a heaven-level two-star mission.

Under normal circumstances, only a True Saint above rank four could complete a heaven-level two-star mission alone. However, the heaven-level two-star mission that Jian Wushuang chose did not specify the number of people. In other words, whether it was one person…or ten people, they could complete the mission.

As for the content of the mission, it was to go to a country and serve as a guard for a hundred years.

“A guard mission?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the mission content with interest.

From the information given by the mission, it was said to be a guard mission, but in fact, it was just a helper hired by others. In addition, it did not need to do anything on a daily basis, as long as it was at a critical time.

In addition, the mission did not require him to run around. When he had nothing to do, Jian Wushuang could cultivate on his own and no one would care about him. In other words, the mission was more comfortable and free.

As for the reward, it was not low, but Jian Wushuang did not care about the reward.

“Let’s do this mission.”

Jian Wushuang made up his mind. He immediately accepted the mission and went directly to that country.

…

The True Martial Kingdom was the most ordinary country among the countless countries in the First Heaven.

This country was an independent country. In other words, there were no sects or forces behind it.

The founder of the True Martial Kingdom was a powerful rank six True Saint who had a large number of experts under his command. His overall strength was extraordinary. With a rank six True Saint overseeing this country for many years, the True Martial Kingdom had lived in peace.

However, three hundred years ago, the king of the True Martial Kingdom had gone out once. After that, there had been no more news.

In other words, this king of the True Martial Kingdom had gone missing!

And in a place like the Divine Beginning World, which was filled with killing, he had gone missing without any reason. It was very likely that he had fallen.

Thus, when there was a disturbance in the Zhen Wu country, it was inevitable that a new king would be needed to clean up this mess.

However, the high-level experts in the True Martial Kingdom had different opinions on the choice of the new king. Gradually, two major factions formed.

One was the Third Prince’s faction, and the other was the Sixth Prince’s faction!

The two factions had been fighting for years, so the king’s position had not been decided.

It was a huge and magnificent mansion, which was where the Sixth Prince of the True Martial Kingdom lived.

“Is this the place?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked down at the mansion.

He was wearing a gray robe, but he did not wear a gray mask. However, he deliberately disguised his appearance.

Without hesitation, he appeared in front of the huge mansion.

“Halt!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang appeared at the gate of the mansion, a loud shout was heard, and then dozens of figures surrounded him.

All of them were experts above the True Saint Realm and were staring at Jian Wushuang.

“My name is Heavenly Sword Marquis. I’m from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I came here because I received a heaven-grade mission from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.” Jian Wushuang explained his purpose of coming and also revealed his divine power aura.

“Someone from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The guards looked at Jian Wushuang deeply and one of them said, “Please wait a moment, I’ll go and report it immediately.”

After a while, a red-robed elder walked out.

“I’m Yuan Chong, one of the servants of the Sixth Prince. Since you’re from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, please show me your identity token,” the red-robed elder said.

Jian Wushuang took a look at the red-robed elder. Although the latter’s aura was very gentle, Jian Wushuang could tell at a glance that he was a True Saint expert who had reached the peak of rank four.

“This is my identity token.” Jian Wushuang handed his identity token to the red-robed elder, Yuan Chong.

Yuan Chong took it, glanced at it, and nodded slightly. “Sir, please come in.”

Under the guidance of Yuan Chong, Jian Wushuang entered the huge mansion.

As soon as he stepped into the mansion, Jian Wushuang immediately sensed that there were a lot of experts’ auras hidden in the mansion.

“There are so many experts. There seem to be dozens of them who are rank three True Saints and above. There are even rank four True Saints and rank five True Saints in this mansion!” Jian Wushuang revealed a surprised look.
