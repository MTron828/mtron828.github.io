“Ha-ha, here we go.”

As a monarch spoke, all the experts in the air looked down.

They stood high above the area, so they could see the entire valley down below.

Inside Sky Valley, the six-warrior team of Tianzong Dynasty slowly walked forward.

“We will meet the geniuses from other dynasties. Which dynasty will we run into first?” Baili Chen said with excitement.

“Even though we are from a small empire, our overall strength is far better than before. We don’t need to be afraid of the other dynasties, except the two large empires,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“Even if we meet the two large empires...”

“The two large empires are too strong, and half of the top 30 warriors in the Ranking belong to them. Moreover, A lot of their warriors met the point requirement in the first stage. They have so many strong warriors that if they take action together it will be too unfair for the teams from other empires!”

“They will also have problems distributing the points if they act in a large group, so they will definitely divide into smaller groups.”

“A large empire will be divided into two teams or more.”

“With our battle strength, we have a chance to win against one of their smaller teams.”

The five people beside Jian Wushuang all nodded to agree with his words.

Indeed, the geniuses of Tianzong Dynasty this time were much stronger than those of previous years, which could be seen from the Rankings.

The two large empires possess half of the geniuses who ranked the top 30 in the standings, and the rest places were carved up by the big contingent of middle-sized empires and small empires. In average, even those middle-sized empires got only one or two geniuses that could be included in the top 30.

As for the small empires, none of the other three small empires had a genius that ranked in the top 30.

While Tianzong Dynasty...two geniuses out of six were in the top 30, and Jian Wushuang was ninth place in the Rankings!

On top of that, Feng Yutian’s strength had soared since he broke through to the Half-step Yin-Yang Realm after the hunt, so he should have the strength to be ranked in the top 30 now.

In other words, three out of the six had a battle strength that could rank in the top 30.

That was even more powerful than those middle-sized empires.

“Although our overall battle strength is very good, the geniuses from other dynasties will still treat us like a normal small empire,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“Hum, if they dare to look down on us, then we will make them pay dearly for their arrogance!”

“He-he, I am already looking forward to our first battle.”

The six geniuses were talking and laughing, dispersing the tension that surrounded them before.

Suddenly...

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked forward, “Here comes our first opponent!”

The other five also looked forward.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures abruptly appeared on the tree branches not far away. Jian Wushuang and the other five also halted their steps.

With a distance of about ten meters, the two teams faced each other.

“It’s them.”

“The Driftcloud Empire!”

“It’s a middle-sized empire.”

Jian Wushuang and his teammates stared at the adversaries in front of them. There were eight of them, two more than their six-warrior team. Because the warriors all wore their identity tokens on an easily seen place, there was no problem recognizing them. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The eight geniuses from the Driftcloud Empire were looking at Jian Wushuang and his team as well.

“It’s the Tianzong Dynasty, one of the four small empires.”

“Ha-ha, seems like we are lucky, the first team we met is from a small empire.”

“A small empire! They are sending points to us, aren’t they?”

The eight geniuses from the Driftcloud Empire were looking forward with sparkling eyes.

There was a wide gap between middle-sized empires and small empires. Generally, the difference between geniuses was also huge.

“Only one of them is difficult to handle, Jian Wushuang, who ranked ninth,” said the indigo-robed man who led the team from the Driftcloud Empire. He looked over at the six-man team and eventually fixed his sight on Jian Wushuang.

“That is Jian Wushuang. Hmm, the ninth place in the Rankings. His ranking is high, but there were too many accidents in the first stage. Even though he has more than me, it doesn’t mean that he is stronger than me!”

The indigo-robed man’s eyes were cold.

The man’s name was Lin Nan, and he was 16th in the Rankings.

His rank was lower than Jian Wushuang, but he didn’t consider himself to be weaker than those who ranked in the top 10.

“Come on!”

A cold radiance flickered in the indigo-robed man’s eyes, then his figure darted toward Jian Wushuang and his team like a phantom, followed by the other geniuses from Driftcloud Empire.

“The first battle in Sky Valley...”

There was a hint of excitement in the six warriors’ eyes.

“Go get them!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

In an instant, the six warriors pounced forward like eagles.

The geniuses from the two teams collided.

“Go to hell!”

The indigo-robed man, Lin Nan, dashed towards Jian Wushuang first, silently thrusting a jet-black long stick toward him.

The stick contained a high comprehension of Earth and Raging Fire essences which were perfectly combined together.

He was also in the Half Step Yin-Yang realm, making the power that radiated from the stick seem horrifying.

“This man’s battle strength is more powerful than Baili Chen.”?Jian Wushuang frowned and thrust out his Triple-kill Sword.

Clang!

The stick shadow clashed with the Triple-kill Sword, causing the sword to tremble slightly. Then, Jian Wushuang instantly retreated, but Lin Nan followed after him.

“Boy, go to hell!”

Lin Nan looked ferocious, using his full power to demonstrate his stick skills.

Streaks of stick shadows rushed out in succession, one by one, as if they were stacked together.

In this short moment, Lin Nan had thrust out with no less than a dozen stick attacks that used his full power.

While Jian Wushuang struggled to ward off the stick with his Triple-kill Sword, he kept retreating backwards and was quickly repulsed by the attacks.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang returned to the giant tree where he was before the fight started,?away from Lin Nan. Baili Chen and the others also appeared beside him, one after another.

In the past moment, they all had encounters with their adversaries.

“How was it?” Jian Wushuang looked at the other five.

“He-he, just so-so. The one who fought against me is in the Half Step Yin-Yang realm, but his comprehension is low. I was able to match him without using my full strength just now. I can definitely kill him once I get serious,” Baili Chen smiled and said.

“Although I fought with two of them, they both have weak comprehension and they haven’t reached Half Step Yin-Yang realm yet. So I’m fairly sure that I can win, “Feng Yutian also said.

“I can remain undefeated against two of them,” Yang Zaixuan’s voice was cold and indifferent.

“If I fight against one, I can gain the upper hand,” said Mu Yingying.

“I can also compete against one of them,” said Su Rou with a timid tone.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help smiling.

In the short fight just now, the six warriors didn’t really exert all their strength. It was just a tentative test.

After the test, they’d learned about the strengths of the eight geniuses from the Driftcloud Empire.
