Xue Guzi was unable to kill the Demon Gods with his strongest move; instead he could only slowly torture them to death. On the other hand, he was confident of killing Jian Wushuang with a single move, as his body was weaker than the Demon Gods’.

Seeing the oncoming strike, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with battle intent. His face was grim.

“Idiot, you’re so eager to kill me that you’ve forgotten what you’re good at.”

”?You want to kill me with your offensive power. Hum, We’ll see who wins!?”

As his killing intent soared, Jian Wushuang tightened his grip on his Emperor Sword. In his sea of consciousness, the sharp Sword Heart suddenly shook, activating 100 percent of its Sword Heart Power.

His Spiritual Power and Physical Strength instantly peaked.

He swung the Emperor Sword, giving full play to the strength of this Eternal Weapon.

“Violet Calamity Sword Skill!”

His eyes flashed.

Jian Wushuang performed the strongest move, Violet Calamity Sword Skill.

A brilliant purple light appeared.

It looked like a purple sun. It was so dazzling that Gu Qiong and Gu Jing could not help but close their eyes.

Xue Guzi was shocked. He had a grim sense of foreboding.

However, it was too late. The brilliant purple sword light had pierced into his scarlet shadow.

Clang!

The collision caused sparks and formless waves to spread in all directions.

“How... how is that possible?”

Xue Guzi looked at the scarlet scythe in disbelief. He sensed a terrifying power being transmitted from his weapon.

Although his defensive skills were weak, his body was still stronger than that of an advanced Divine Realm expert.

However, being confronted with the terrifying power, his right palm suddenly shook and burst apart.

His whole arm disintegrated into a fog of blood in the blink of an eye.

The initial confrontation had already disabled him.

What did this mean?

”?Impossible!?”

Xue Guzi glared at Jian Wushuang as if he had forgotten his pain.

Seven days ago, he had witnessed Jian Wushuang fighting against Gong Chao.

He had thought that Jian Wushuang was an advanced Divine Realm expert.

He had told Wu Dao and Dao Mei that Jian Wushuang would not stand a chance against them.

However, the head-on confrontation with Jian Wushuang had shattered his right arm and hand.

”?He definitely has the battle strength of a superior Divine Realm expert and his offensive power is greater than an ordinary one!?”

Xue Guzi’s face paled. He had lost his right hand as well as his scarlet scythe, so his battle strength plummeted.

“Run!”

Xue Guzi wanted to escape.

Jian Wushuang had pre-empted this. He immediately displayed his exquisite swordsmanship.

Streaks of sword shadows that formed a huge net fell toward Xue Guzi.

“World Prison!” Jian Wushuang growled.

Mighty World Energy gushed out and formed a colossal World Prison around his opponent.

Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Fifth Occult of the World Dao, so the World Prison was more powerful than before.

World Prison and Sword Net suppressed Xue Guzi and slowed him down.

Xue Guzi was running around in wild panic within the World Prison. He might have been able to escape from the World Prison alone, but faced with the sword net...

Jian Wushuang chased Xue Guzi so relentlessly that the latter struggled to keep resisting.

“Piss off!”

“Piss off!”

A sickle appeared in Xue Guzi’s left hand. He wanted to fight back with it.

However, he had no chance to do so.

“What?”

“He is so powerful?”

“I know his swordsmanship is exquisite, but how could it be so terrifying?”

It was terrifying indeed.

He had thought that with his skills at the Saber Technique, he would be able to withstand Jian Wushuang’s attacks for a while despite having to use his left hand.

The facts were however, way beyond what he expected.

“Jian Wushuang, you hid your strength?” Xue Guzi snarled as he stared at his opponent.

“Right, you’ve finally realized it, but it’s too late!” Jian Wushuang responded with a sneer.

He brandished the Emperor Sword and knocked the sickle away.

At this point, Gu Qiong and Gu Jing dashed over to Xue Guzi and cut off his escape route.

“No, no!”

Xue Guzi roared in despair.

Knowing that he was at death’s door, his desperation turned to madness.

“Jian Wushuang, even if I die, I won’t make it easy for you.

“The Eternal Zone will be your grave!

“Haha!” Xue Guzi laughed out.

He stared at Jian Wushuang with red eyes as he waved with his only hand...

Bang!

Xue Guzi suddenly burst into a fog of blood.
