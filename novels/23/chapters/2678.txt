Chapter 2679: One Slash Kill!

“Kill him!” Two figures took action at the same time upon the Purple Beast Alliance Master’s order.

Those two were the petite old man while the other was an evil-looking woman in black clothes—the left and right guardian of the Purple Beast Alliance. They were both extremely strong High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods.

Hiss~

The void seems as though it had been pierced open as a black sword appeared beside Jian Wushuang and quietly pierced toward his heart.

On the other hand, the petite old man with a golden hammer in each hand directly attacked Jian Wushuang.

However, the black sword and golden hammers failed to touch Jian Wushuang’s actual body but travelled through his figure instead.

Whoosh!

It was unknown when but Jian Wushuang’s body had appeared in a nearby void.

“He seems to have good speeds.” The petite young man and the evil black-clothed woman immediately looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“I’m not interested in mediocre people.” Jian Wushuang mocked but his eyes were fixated on the Purple Beast Alliance Master.

“The Purple Beast Alliance Master had extremely strong combat power among the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods and is especially good at attacking and killing but his physical protection capabilities can only be considered normal,” mumbled Jian Wushuang softly.

He also obtained detailed information about the Purple Beast Alliance Master and his experts’ true strength.

He only dared to appear openly because he had all that information.

“The Dragon Divine Gang isn’t weak whilst this Purple Beast Alliance is slightly stronger. I can subdue both forces, but I’ll have to show my absolute strength to make both forces’ experts surrender willingly.”

“I have to kill this Purple Beast Alliance Master neatly!” Jian Wushuang had a cold look in his eyes while the magnificent divine power on his body had already expanded while a huge amount of golden divine power coagulated like crazy behind his back. The 3,000-meter-tall Golden God Shadow appeared behind Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

The Golden God Shadow was extremely majestic as it looked down at everything in heaven and earth.

At the same time, the Seven Stars Secret Technique in Jian Wushuang’s body was also unleashed outward.

The divine power on his body had immediately skyrocketed the moment he used the Seven Stars Secret Technique!

Those below Undying Saint could directly elevate their strength by an entire realm with the Seven Stars Secret Technique Scroll Two.

Jian Wushuang was only a Peak Earth Ultimate God, but his realm was directly raised to the Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God after displaying the Seven Stars Secret Technique. The divine power he emitted was that of a Peak Heaven Ultimate God stage under the black stone’s disguise!!

“His aura...has strengthened!!”

“Peak Heaven Ultimate God—it’s a Peak Heaven Ultimate God’s divine power!” The expressions of many Purple Beast Alliance experts darkened.

Even the Purple Beast Alliance Master who initially did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang also looked at him with a peculiar expression.

Jian Wushuang’s combat power had been raised to an astonishing level after using both the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment.

‘These two secret techniques should be more than sufficient to kill this Purple Beast Alliance Master.’ Jian Wushuang secretly smiled.

He then directly made his move.

Hum!

His figure had only slightly moved forward but it ended up with him directly crossing the lengthy distance and appearing in front of the crowd. The speed he burst out in that instant staggered the crowd.

“This speed...” The Purple Beast Alliance Master was also startled.

Bang!

The Purple Beast Alliance Master banged on his throne’s armrest as his divine power was immediately unleashed. His figure was like a primitive beast as he attacked Jian Wushuang.

“So what if you’re fast? The battle between experts has never relied on speed,” said the Purple Beast Alliance Master coldly as a domineering axe appeared in his hand. The axe could be identified as a high-level Heavenly Treasure as it looked extremely powerful.

As the Alliance Master was about to wave the axe in his hand...

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently before him as he slowly stretched out his palm and pointed at the area Purple Beast Alliance Master was located!

“A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!”

Hum~~

A simple finger pointing had evoked the Space-time Energy around that area.

The Alliance Master’s figure paused in the middle of the air without any warning.

Although his body paused, his face still had that hideous expression along with his one hand raised while still maintaining the action of waving his axe. However, the space-time he was in had already completely paused.

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique—the divine technique Jian Wushuang comprehended for nine years before he barely grasped it.

Although he had only barely grasped the technique and his strength was too low, fully displaying that skill with his perception of the Space-time law at that moment was not something a usual Peak Heaven Ultimate God could pull off. He could make the space-time an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God was to fall into an extremely short stasis.

The period was extremely short. It was just a moment that was even shorter than the blink of an eye. However, this short moment was enough to decide lots of matters in a fight between experts.

It could be seen that Jian Wushuang’s figure was unaffected at all and had already appeared in front of the Purple Beast Alliance Master. The latter remained in his axe waving position but without the axe landing the entire time. The space-time where the Alliance Master was in only returned to normal when Jian Wushuang had waved his longsword. The Blood Mountain Sword had attacked toward the Alliance Master like a poisonous snake and was only half a centimetre away from the Alliance Master’s head.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master could not react in time despite space-time around him having already recovered.

Slurp!

The cold sword flitted through mercilessly and the Alliance Master’s head had flown outward as his life had started to fade away.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master still had that frightened expression on his face just before he died.

“How can he be so fast?” The corners of his mouth were still mumbling softly.

He was in a situation where both space-time and his consciousness was stagnant. He had no idea about what happened during the time his consciousness was stagnant.

Therefore, he still thought that Jian Wushuang killed him with incredible speed. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He had no idea Jian Wushuang had used divine techniques. Although Jian Wushuang was fast, it was not so exaggerated.

“My divine power and Space-time law perspective are sufficient to fight with an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God. I’m the strongest among the experts of the Peak Heaven Ultimate God stage once I display the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment. It’s very easy to kill an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God with this almost god-like ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique’.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

The Purple Beast Alliance experts surrounding them looked extremely stunned.

In their impression, their Alliance Master was extremely strong since the previous Peak Heaven Ultimate God Dragon Divine Gang Leader was directly killed by their Alliance Master.

However, their powerful Alliance Master died in someone else’s hands at that moment?

In addition...it happened so fast!
