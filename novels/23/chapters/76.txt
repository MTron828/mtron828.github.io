Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The huge and mighty sword shadow crashed down.

“The Eighth Move?”

“He can master the Eighth Move?”

All the disciples of Dragon Palace held their breath.

“Go away!” Nangong Jie shouted suddenly with a tremendous Spiritual Power erupting out of him.

“What?” everyone was surprised.

An icy sword shadow erupted with incomparable power, struck out directly and tore the sword shadow into pieces immediately. The mighty power then turned into a strong breeze and dissipated.

However, after tearing the sword shadow into pieces, the power of that sword shadow still persisted and turned into a light flying straight towards Jian Wushuang.

“What’s this?” shockingly, Jian Wushuang swung his sword against it immediately.

Clang!

A violent power crashed over Jian Wushuang with a loud bang. He was forced to step back, each step heavy enough to crack the ground.

When he came to a stop, he shook his stinging palms.

Jian Wushuang looked up at Nangong Jie again with an extremely serious expression, “Nangong Jie, I have looked down on you. I would have never thought that you would not only hide your comprehension of Sword Essence, but also your Cultivation of Spiritual Power.”

“Maybe only a few people knew you were at Profound Gold Core Realm in Dragon Palace.”

Profound Gold Core Realm!

Right. This moment, the Spiritual Power of Nangong Jie had reached Profound Gold Core Realm.

When the Disciples of Dragon Palace on Martial Art Practice Field noticed his Spiritual Power, a stir was raised.

“Profound Gold Core Realm? Nangong Jie has reached Profound Gold Core Realm?”

“A man who has reached Profound Gold Core Realm challenged a new guy who was at the Level of Spiritual Sea to a duel?

“Nangong Jie might be going too far!”

The gazes of disciples of Dragon Palace looking at Nangong Jie, suddenly changed.

One should know that one has his own pride as a genius. Anyway, Jian Wushuang had just reached Spiritual Sea Realm. As a Primordial Gold Core, Nangong Jie was just bullying.

And now, Nangong Jie had revealed that his Cultivation of Spiritual Power reached Profound Gold Core Realm.

“A man who has reached Profound Gold Core Realm challenged a warrior who was at the Level of Spiritual Sea to a duel?

It was far more than bullying, this was shameless!

“Nangong Jie, as a Profound Gold Core Realm, you challenged my bro to a duel? You are so shameless, so brazen! If I were you, I would hide my face in disgrace.” Wang Yuan shouted from the sidelines.

“Huh.” Nangong Jie looked around and said in his chilliest tone, “The world has its law of the jungle, and the Dragon Palace has too. How would you fight a duel to win points if you don’t even know how to hide your strength?”

“Swordsman.” Nangong Jie looked at Jian Wushuang, “you, as a freshman entering Dragon Palace for less than three months, it’s an honor to force me to this situation. I will still gladly accept your twelve thousand points.”

Boom!

Nangong Jie pushed off the ground which cracked at once.

With an ear-piercing rushing sound, Nangong Jie slashed with his sword. It was still Formless Swordsmanship.

Under the outburst of Spiritual Power of Profound Gold Core Realm, the speed and power had both reached a brand new level.

The sword light pierced the void and whistled, its amazing speed and intense power were heart-stopping.

Disciples of Dragon Palace held their breath as they watched this.

“Nangong Jie, do you think you can defeat me like this? Ridiculous.” Jian Wushuang sneered. Although Nangong Jie’s Spiritual Power was at Profound Gold Core Realm, he was still calm.

“Reincarnation Sword Skill!”

When Nangong Jie’s swordsmanship swept through, Jian Wushuang engaged Reincarnation Sword Skill.

The vast Sword Essence of Earth was maximized in the meantime.

Reincarnation Sword Skill, a defensive Sword Skill, which could be exchanged for with1,500 points. It could not be compared to Formless Sword Wave. However, if it was properly used, its power could overcome the Formless Sword Wave.

Moreover, because of the low points needed for Reincarnation Sword Skill and its outwardly simple technique compared to Formless Sword Wave and Formless Swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang could master this Sword Skill perfectly.

Jian Wushuang has completely mastered the Reincarnation Sword Skill in the last three months, even reaching the peak.

And now he used the Reincarnation Sword Skill to its full potential.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Continuous clanging sounded around the Martial Art Practice Field, the surrounding Disciples of Dragon Palace were shocked to see this.

“How fast! How strong!”

“This swordsmanship is so fast, so amazing!”

“Look, the Swordsman is being completely suppressed, he seems to be losing!”

“That is not necessarily the case. Don’t you see that the Swordsman has resisted Nangong Jie’s swordsmanship even though he is being suppressed all the time. His defense is watertight!”

“Right. He has mastered the Reincarnation Sword Skill completely and put it to good use. It won’t be easy for Nangong Jie to win.”

Lots of disciples started discussing in whispers.

On the battlefield, Sword Flash struck at high speed and from multiple angles. Nangong Jie’s swordsmanship, perception of Sword Essence and Cultivation of Spiritual Power of the Profound Gold Core Realm had reached perfection.

The heart palpitating Sword Flash generated an irresistible feeling among the surrounding disciples.

But what about Jian Wushuang?

The sword kept moving, dauntless.

His swordsmanship seems simple, but resisted all the sword shadows perfectly.

It was true that Nangong Jie’s Sword Flash was powerful, and it had completely suppressed Jian Wushuang who had no chance to strike back. Still, Jian Wushuang was resisting every attack from Nangong Jie.

“Well, although his Cultivation of Spiritual has reached Profound Gold Core Realm and his power is much better than mine, I can still defend. When I use my Reincarnation Swordsmanship, I can weaken the power of his swordsmanship. Otherwise, even if I could block, its impact force would be enough to defeat me.”

“But now, he can dream about my defeat.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold.

The most exquisite part of Reincarnation Sword Skill is its ability to wear the opponent down. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Using the sword strokes to weaken the power gradually. Finally, the power from the attacks had no impact to him.

“This boy is so hard to deal with.”

Nangong Jie’s expression became unsightly as his attacks were blocked by Jian Wushuang over and over again.
