Chapter 5530 ¬†Kill Tie San

As the sword was unsheathed, the entire space was instantly leveled, and all matter was annihilated‚Äîa silence emanating from the depths of life.

Anyone who came into contact with it met their demise.

Tie San gazed at the sword move in astonishment, somewhat dazed, exclaiming, "How can this be!"

"How did he become so strong!"

But now, there was no time to be shocked; he could only forcefully intervene.

In the void.

A massive Dao Image rose, and Tie San began to fight desperately.

Pointing his finger, he gathered his essence, determined to break through this sword move at all costs.

The power contained in the sword move made him tremble.

If he wasn't careful, he would truly fall into the hands of Jian Wushuang today.

"Break!"

The immense finger shadow collided with the Jueyun Sword.

This finger, staked on the essence and spirit, shattered the moment it touched the Jueyun Sword.

God-Destroyer!

At the moment of annihilation, Tie San's face contorted, and not only his physical body but also his divine body and Origin Source lost their original shapes, continuously distorting until they dissipated.

Tie San had completely turned into ashes, fallen.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes; the black hole was contracting rapidly. Originally covering the entire continent, it had now dissipated, and the black hole had become very small.

He had indeed killed a peak-level tier 6 Emperor.

Although most of it was due to the Destruction Origin Source and the clandestine assistance of Wu Zuo, the opponent also genuinely died at his hands.

Casually collecting the opponent's mustard seed, he pulled Gong Miaoyi and left the black hole.

In the next moment, the black hole completely turned into a point, and then the space began to restore, everything returned to calm.

In the air, a mustard seed was still floating, it belonged to Si Tian.

Wu Zuo did not personally give him the Beast God Weapon because the plan was crucial and couldn't be disclosed to anyone, not even Gong Miaoyi.

Excited about this, Jian Wushuang directly put it away.

As for Wu Zuo, he is still trapped in the black hole.

A very secretive voice echoed in Jian Wushuang's mind!

"In three breaths, I will break through the black hole. At that time, you must take my blow, get severely injured, and then directly enter the teleportation array and leave, following the planned route!"

The voice came from Wu Zuo, but Jian Wushuang did not respond. He pulled Gong Miaoyi and headed towards the central hall.

The Emperors who were watching, whether they were powerful elders from the Elder Palace or others, all looked at him, and no one intervened.

Because Tie San was already dead.

Such a big disturbance even awakened Qingniu, who was in seclusion, but he did not appear.

However, Emperor Lu Hua frowned; he was beginning to doubt his own actions. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

Jian Wushuang was taken out by his people, and now he killed Tie San and was about to escape!

In the future, if accountability were to come down on him, he feared...

The Inheritors, on the other hand, cheered loudly. Not only did they not intervene, but they even made way for Jian Wushuang.

On the Demon Sound Mountain, Divine General Moyin and Lord Yun Zhong stood side by side, watching everything.

"How should we handle this?"

Divine General Moyin turned to look at Lord Yun Zhong, puzzled. "Handle what?" "Just like that, we're going to let him escape?" Lord Yun Zhong pointed at Jian Wushuang.

"What else can we do?"

The Elder Palace had no connection with the two of them; it was only because of Zhen Ling that they had come here.

They wouldn't meddle in internal conflicts unless a supreme-peak was involved.

Especially the kind of supreme-peak expert with unclear background details. The supreme-peak expert being dragged by Vice Hall Master Zhong was targeted by the Divine General Moyin precisely because of the unclear details.

Of course, there was a significant part of the reason for rescuing Jian Wushuang.

If they were to stop Jian Wushuang, they would end up taking the blame themselves.

After all, the release of Jian Wushuang and Divine General Moyin had a certain connection.

Lord Yun Zhong sighed and said, "Forget it, consider it watching a good show. I seem to have misjudged Jian Wushuang's character. To be able to do something like this, it reminds me of my past brilliance!"

Speaking, he disappeared from sight.

The Demon Sound Divine General looked somewhat disdainful. Back then, Lord Yun Zhong didn't have the courage like this. In the past, he shamelessly pursued Emperor Jueyun, only to be severely injured by a slap from Emperor Jueyun. His divine body cracked open, and it took several epochs to recover.

Countless gazes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Three breaths of time passed.

A colossal centipede, tearing through heaven and earth, surged out from the black hole.

Wu Zuo, in a light yellow Daoist robe, stood on top of the centipede.

At this moment, he was filled with anger, and thunderous power emanated from his violet eyes. A thunderbolt, the size of ten thousand feet, shot out directly towards Jian Wushuang.

The onlookers once again stepped back.

It was Wu Zuo who made a move. Even if they were affected, they might perish.

"It's over. Jian Wushuang has seriously offended Wu Zuo!"

Many people quickly retreated.

The purple thunderbolt instantly arrived behind Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was well-prepared. If he really got hit, he would fall.

This could be considered a desperate move!

Of course, he wouldn't really engage in a head-on confrontation.

He casually took out a white jade sphere and threw it backward.

The jade sphere spun wildly, then erupted with a scorching light that instantly swept across the land.

Although it blocked most of the power of the purple thunderbolt, some small lightning snakes still approached Jian Wushuang.

Just before those lightning snakes touched him, Jian Wushuang pulled Gong Miaoyi over and shielded her behind him, actively taking the hit.

"Ah!!!"

The tremendous inertia caused Jian Wushuang to release Gong Miaoyi's hand, and he flew backward.

A burst of golden blood spewed out, and Jian Wushuang felt like his entire Origin Source was entangled by the electric snakes.

This time, it wasn't just a simple injury.

If it were just physical trauma, he could recover instantly, possessing a powerful Life Origin Source capable of rapid healing.

However, after the electric serpent entered his body, it infiltrated his Origin Source. To dispel it, it would take at least a hundred years.

This time, he exerted immense perseverance.

Simultaneously, to ensure safety, he had many contingency plans.

In case Gong Miaoyi fled, he had a rapid rescue method; Wu Zuo had given him an antidote.

But to test Gong Miaoyi and the eyes of the Misty Shadow Sect, he couldn't easily use it.

Jian Wushuang covered his chest, looking up as Gong Miaoyi flew over, and breathed a sigh of relief.

There was no point in worrying if she would run away later. Rather, he was afraid she would run now when he was in such a state.

That would be a major loss.

He didn't need to escape anymore; he might as well let Wu Zuo kill him.

Without Gong Miaoyi's support, his plan would be challenging to succeed.

Gong Miaoyi was used to confuse Shen Ling.

It depended on whether the other party would fall for it.

"Go!" This time, Gong Miaoyi pulled him, directly entering the teleportation array in the central hall.

Qiuhuang didn't say much, just nodded, then immediately activated the formation.

Moments before Wu Zuo descended, the two successfully escaped.

Wu Zuo, who arrived at the scene, was extremely furious.

There was no trace of pretense at all.
