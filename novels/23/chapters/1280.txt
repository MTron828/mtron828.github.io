Chapter 1281: Lord Summon

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jin Feng and Jiu Xi had died one after the other. Golden-sun Sect Master had already begun inspecting why this had occurred.

10 years!

For cultivation, 10 years was a short period of time, but for killing people, it was too long.

The person who had killed Jin Feng had been able to kill Jiu Xi on the spot, instead of delaying it for 10 years.

Therefore, Golden-sun Sect Master was not sure whether it was the same person who had killed Jin Feng and Jiu Xi.

“Golden-sun Sect Master,” Commander Man Yi said again, “everything has to be checked out. In my opinion, let’s sit down and have a talk. I’ve already sent a message to my lord. He will immediately arrive. Everything will be clear.”

“Lord of Scarlet Island?” Golden-sun Sect Master’s eyes narrowed.

Although both Lord of Scarlet Island and Golden-sun Sect Master were Universe Gods at the Peak of Second Heaven, the former was superior to the latter. If Lord of Scarlet Island arrived, Golden-sun Sect Master would be unable to do anything to Jian Wushuang, even if they finally confirmed Jian Wushuang was the killer.

“Hey, I will find it out. Jian Wushuang, you’d better have nothing to do with Jin Feng’s death, otherwise… I’ll kill you, even if I need to have an all-out fight with Scarlet Island!”

“I’ll avenge my son’s death. I won’t let it go so easily!”

His frosty voice echoed through the area.

Then Golden-sun Sect turned into a golden light and left.

Commander Man Yi and other experts sighed with relief.

Jian Wushuang also felt relieved.

Fortunately, he didn’t really want to offend this Universe God at the Peak of Second Heaven. The consequences were beyond his imagination.

“Jin Feng is his son?” Jian Wushuang wore an odd expression on his face.

No one had expected that Golden-sun Sect Master was Jin Feng’s father!

It was no wonder that Golden-sun Sect Master was so furious that he personally came to attack Jian Wushuang regardless of his identity.

The golden Flowing Light streaked out of the Scarlet Island military camp and came to a halt until it reached a void above the sea.

Golden-sun Sect Master showed up.

A black figure appeared next to him.

“Golden-sun Sect Master, do you really believe that Jian Wushuang has nothing to do with the death of Jin Feng?” The black figure smirked.

He had been hiding in the distance, so Jian Wushuang had not discovered him.

Golden-sun Sect Master responded in a frosty voice, “Hmm, of course. I don’t believe him.”

“Then why did you not kill him?” The black figure was astonished.

He had been wondering why Golden-sun Sect Master had not attacked Jian Wushuang. He had thought that the Sect Master was powerful enough to deal with it and even Man Yi was unable to block him.

“I wanted to kill him just now, but did you really treat Scarlet Island as a fool? Is it really easy to break into their military camp?” Golden-sun Sect Master snorted. “I already knew that there was a hidden Restriction on the Scarlet Island and that Man Yi would activate it at a critical moment. It is powerful enough to kill ordinary Second Heaven Universe Gods, so it might hurt me badly.

“And I planned to quietly catch Jian Wushuang and then leave so that Scarlet Island couldn’t do anything to me.

“I didn’t expect that Jian Wushuang had a keen psychic ability and perceived my arrival in advance. If I had fought against him, Man Yi would have activated the Restriction. I couldn’t endanger my safety let alone catch Jian Wushuang.”

“I understand.” The black figure replied.

“Hump, although I failed this time, I will eventually avenge my son!” Golden-sun Sect master clenched his hands, then looked at the black figure next to him, “How about you?”

“So will my Holy Prefecture. If there is an opportunity, I will do my best to kill him!” The black figure said coldly.

“That’s good, Jian Wushuang can’t run.” Golden-sun Sect Master’s eyes lit up.

On Scarlet Island, Commander Man Yi, Jian Wushuang, and the other Universe Gods gathered.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve told the lord about what happened here, and he asked you to return to our headquarters immediately. He wants to see you,” Commander Man Yi said.

“The lord personally summoned me?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Commander Man Yi ordered. “Let’s go.”

“Us?” Jian Wushuang asked, looking puzzled.

Commander Man Yi explained. “The Holy Prefecture and Golden-sun Sect want to kill you. You might get into trouble on your way to the headquarters, so the lord asked me to personally escort you back.”

“The commander will personally escort you. Few experts on our island have such special treatment.” The other Universe Gods teased Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go.” Commander Man Yi spoke.

Then Jian Wushuang and Commander Man Yi set off.

The Scarlet Island occupied a vast territory in the Dayu Region. There were more than a hundred cities, not to mention other special places.

The headquarters of Scarlet Island was in the center of Scarlet City.

Nine Star Sea was not too far away from the Scarlet City. Escorted by Commander Man Yi, Jian Wushuang had not encountered any enemies on his way. Soon, they arrived at Scarlet City.

Once they had arrived, Commander Man Yi immediately led him to visit the Lord of Scarlet Island.

In the front of a magnificent golden temple, there was a towering throne. In a white robe, a bald man sat there, barefoot. He wore a kind smile on his round face. It made him appear a kind-hearted man.

The smiling bald man was the supreme lord of Scarlet Island.

“Lord.” Commander Man Yi bowed to the bald man.

“I pay my respects to my lord.” Jian Wushuang also bowed to the bald man, but he was a bit frightened.

Although the bald man was smiling, Jian Wushuang felt more anxious around him than he did around Golden-sun Sect Master.
