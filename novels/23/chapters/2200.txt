Chapter 2201 Jian Wushuang’s Awakening

“Brother!”Wang Yuan turned around and stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master!” Hall Master Yuan was pleasantly surprised.

“It is me. Took both of you some time to recognize me,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Oh god yes. You finally awakened,” Wang Yuan charged at Jian Wushuang and gave him a bear hug.

“From what I have heard, it looks like I have been in slumber for a long time. Furthermore, your alchemist skills have improved greatly, am I right?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Of course. I am now the best alchemist in the Eternal Chaotic World,” Wang Yuan said triumphantly.

“The best in the Eternal Chaotic World? Are you really that good?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Palace Master, Mr Wang Yuan indeed possesses incredible alchemist skills. The reason why your soul could recover so quickly was because he made numerous Ice Soul Elixir for you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked at Wang Yuan.

“Let’s not talk about this. It is wonderful that you finally awakened from your slumber. I’ll gather everyone else.” Wang Yuan started transmitting messages.

Jian Wushuang did not stop Wang Yuan.

Soon, the message got through to Jian Nantian, Ji Wumeng, Su Rou, Lin Lan, He Xiu, Xue Lingtian, and many other people who were close to Jian Wushuang.

“Wushuang.” Jian Nantian and his wife looked at their son, elated.

“Dad, Mum, I am not a good child. I made both of you worry,” Jian Wushuang apologized.

“It is okay. You have awakened.” Jian Nantian did not blame him and heaved a sigh of relief.

He took the most pride in his son.

Jian Wushuang was not only the backbone of the Green Fire World, but also of the Eternal Chaotic World.

Jian Wushuang then greeted Su Rou and the remaining people.

He was surprised that many of his close friends had become much stronger.

Wang Yuan had already been an extremely skilled alchemist before the great battle, though he was still far from being the best alchemist. Even though not everyone agreed that Wang Yuan was the best alchemist, he was confident that he was. His alchemist skills had improved greatly, seeing the attitude of the brown haired elder man when he was requesting for Wang Yuan’s service.

His father, Jian Nantian, had previously been in the realm of sir god. Now, he was in the realm of emperor god!

Su Rou and Xue Lingtian had both reached the realm of sir god.

Even though Green Fire World had an extremely conducive cultivating environment, these people would not have improved so greatly without time.

“How long have I been in slumber?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Soon, everyone within the palace were being served with good food and wine. They sat down and started chatting.

Jian Wushuang finally knew how long he had been in a slumber.

Twenty-four thousand years!!!

Yes, after the great battle, he had fallen into a deep slumber.

It had been twenty-four thousand years since that great battle.

To Jian Wushuang, this was a great amount of time.

He had cultivated for less than ten thousand years since birth, unlike many almighty experts within the Eternal Chaotic who were at hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years old.

Emperor Bai was an example of such an expert. He had been born in the first era, and his age was beyond Jian Wushuang’s wildest imagination.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang got to know what everyone had done for him when he was in deep slumber.

He knew the cost of building the Taiying Soul Resurrection Formation and the Spiritual Pool.

On top of this, the cost of making Ice Soul Elixirs!

“Big Boss Wang Yuan.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Wang Yuan gratefully and with excitement.

Wang Yuan had had to make one Ice Soul Elixir every ten years for him for twenty-four thousand years.

Ice Soul Elixir was an extremely high grade elixir. If it had been any other alchemist in the Eternal Chaotic World, they might only have been able to make one, even if they had sufficient resources, after hundreds of years. However, Wang Yuan had made two-thousand four-hundred elixirs within this short amount of time.

This was an enormous amount.

“Thank you!” Jian Wushuang finally said these two words.

“Haha. You do not need to be so formal with me, brother,” Wang Yuan answered casually.

Their relationship went beyond life and death.

They were brothers who went through thick and thin together.

To Wang Yuan, it was nothing to spend some time on making some elixirs for Jian Wushuang.

After a deep breath, Jian Wushuang started asking about what had changed in the Green Fire World.

Twenty four thousand years was a very long time. A lot had changed in the Green Fire World.

There were now twenty six almighties, including Jian Nantian, who was an emperor god. There were numerous real gods and other geniuses.

“The Green Fire World really did grow.”

“This is just the beginning. Given time, the number of experts within the Green Fire World will only increase and it will be confirmed as one of the best places within the Eternal Chaotic World.”

Jian Wushuang felt that his hard work was worth it given how much the Green Fire World had grown and prospered.

“Wushuang, you should inform Emperor Bai and the rest of the great emperors that you have awakened. During the time that you were in slumber, they put in great effort to help you build the Tai Ying Resurrection Formation and the Spiritual Pool. Furthermore, it cost a fortune to keep these running,” Jian Nantian said.

“Yes, I have already transmitted a message,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He transmitted the message when he awakened. Emperor Bai and the rest would be on their way.

“Not just Emperor Bai, you should tell the experts from the Special Tribes. Furthermore, what is with the Black Dragon Emperor?” Wang Yuan asked out of nowhere.

“Black Dragon Emperor? What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

“Don’t act dumb. It is obvious that she is interested in you. When you were in your slumber, she would visit you once every now and then. She is the leader of her clan and has a lot of urgent matters to attend to, yet she visited you more than Emperor Bai and the other experts?” Wang Yuan asked playfully.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was stunned but helpless.

He knew that Black Dragon Emperor was interested in him. However, he was already married. In this life, he would only love his wife and his wife alone. He would not accept anyone else.

“Looks like I have to speak to Black Dragon Emperor about this,” Jian Wushuang muttered.
