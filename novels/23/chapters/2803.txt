Chapter 2804: Settling Scores in the Autumn!

(It’s the fifth watch today!)

——

“If Jian Yi were to appear personally, the Alliance Army of the four forces would have no chance of resisting. We would only be slaughtered by him easily.”

“Therefore, we only have two options now. First, we should take advantage of the fact that Yin Su’er and the Sword Alliance have yet to make a move and bring their own resources and subordinates to escape from the Pill Sun Continent. We might even escape to another sacred world.” The Dongfang clan head said in a low voice.

“Escape from the Pill Sun Continent?” The life and death tower master’s expression changed, but he immediately shook his head, “The life and death tower has many trump cards. All of them are on the Pill Sun Continent. How can we take them away in such a short time? Not to mention that the Crimson Rock Castle will definitely think of this in advance and take precautions. Even if we don’t take any trump cards with us, I’m afraid we won’t be able to leave the Pill Sun Sacred World so easily.”

“Indeed. Under the current situation, it’s already very difficult for us to retreat safely. Since that’s the case, there’s only one way left. We have to compromise!” The Dongfang family head said.

“Compromise? How do we compromise?” The life and death tower head looked over.

“Our four great factions have deep foundations on the Pill Sun Continent, and our influence is incomparably great. If the Crimson Rock Castle wants to uproot us, it definitely won’t be so easy. Moreover, even if they really have the ability, they probably won’t do so. After all, they have to think for the entire Pill Sun Sacred World and the situation of the Pill Sun Sacred World in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Therefore, as long as we are willing to compromise, Yin Su’er will most likely not continue attacking us,” the Dongfang family head said.

“We just have to compromise?” The senior great deity from the Fiendgod sect immediately asked.

“Of course it’s not that simple.” The Dongfang family patriarch’s face was cold, “Right now, the four of us are fish on the chopping block. We are practically at the mercy of Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union. In such a situation, if we want to compromise, we have to be prepared to pay a huge price. The price might even be so great that we can not accept it. But if we want to survive on the Pill Sun Continent, we have no choice but to accept it!”

“Although I don’t know what the three of you are thinking, I have already made up my mind. Regardless of what conditions Yin Su’er will come up with, even if it means reducing the overall strength of our Dongfang family by 70%, as long as we can continue to stay on the Pill Sun Continent and gain a foothold, our Dongfang family will be able to accept it,” the Dongfang family head said.

Hearing these words, the life and death tower lord and the two senior great divine paragons had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

The Dongfang family was the most ancient family clan in the Pill Sun Continent. Their foundations were so deep that other than the Nangong Wugong, the life and death tower could not compare to the Fiendgod sect.

But now, the Dongfang family Lord had said that he would rather lose seventy percent of his strength and was willing to compromise. What sort of great determination was this?

“I understand. All of you should disperse. It’s fine as long as you are mentally prepared.” The life and death tower lord waved his hand.

Very quickly, the four figures slowly dispersed.

...

Time flashed by. It had been three months since the end of the great battle.

During these three months, whether it was Crimson Rock Castle or the Sword Alliance, they were all incomparably calm on the surface.

However, in the dark, Yin Su’er had already ordered people to keep a close eye on the movements of the four top forces.

Once the four top forces made any movements, the Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union would immediately take action.

Fortunately, the four top forces did not make any big movements during the past three months. They also did not want to give up their foundations. Many experts showed no signs of fleeing.

After three months, the injuries and divine power of the experts of Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union had mostly recovered.

Even those who were seriously injured had recovered 60-70% of their strength. As for full recovery, it was not something that could be completed in just three months. Not to mention three months, even three years or 30 years might not be enough to completely recover.

Although they had not fully recovered their strength, it did not affect the next steps of the Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union.

In the vast void, the experts of the Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union gathered together again. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Three months have passed. Now we can go to the four top forces to settle the score.” Yin Su’er’s expression was cold.

“Lord...” Jian Wushuang was about to speak.

“Mr. Jian Yi, please stop calling me lord. I can’t afford it. If you don’t mind, you can just call me by my name or Su’er,” Yin Su’er said, looking extremely humble.

In front of her, Jian Wushuang was indeed just a little guy.

His strength was like an ant, so she could not care less about him. At that time, she felt at ease when Jian Wushuang called her lord.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s strength far exceeded her, and he controlled the huge sword league. His strength and power were not weaker than hers. The battle three months ago was saved by Jian Wushuang alone.

Under such circumstances, how could she dare to put on airs in front of Jian Wushuang? Let alone allow Jian Wushuang to call her lord.

“Castle Lord Su’er.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. “I must deal with the four top forces, but I don’t know how to deal with them. Should I destroy them all, or...”

Yin Su’er’s eyes darkened slightly. After thinking for a long time, she said, “Not all. If possible, it’s best if none of them are destroyed.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you’ve only been wandering in the Pill Sun Sacred World, so you don’t know much about the outside world. Since my father died, our strength has been greatly reduced. Over the years, our Crimson Rock Castle has been engaged in civil war. This war may look like a great victory for our Crimson Rock Castle, but in fact, we’ve lost a lot of experts.”

“To put it bluntly, the current situation of the Pill Sun Sacred World isn’t looking good. In the Golden Crow Nine Realms, our Pill Sun Sacred World is definitely the weakest. In fact, we are already extremely weak. Under such circumstances, we should save as much as we can from unnecessary battles.”

“For example, the top four powers like the Nan Wu Palace, the Tower of life and death, the Divine Devil Sect, and the Dongfang family. Although they don’t belong to our Crimson Rock Castle, they still belong to the Pill Sun Sacred World. If we were to wipe out all four of these top powers in one go, not only would our Crimson Rock Castle lose a portion of our experts, but our Pill Sun Sacred World’s battle prowess would also be further weakened.”

“If we are truly weakened to the extreme, then we will be under too much pressure from the outside world. For example, the appearance of the Heavenly Void Temple in this battle is already a sign. The Heavenly Void Temple has openly attacked our Crimson Rock Castle this time. This has never happened before.”

Yin Su’er frowned tightly, but her heart was incomparably solemn.

After that battle, the internal conflict between Crimson Rock Castle and the Pill Sun Sacred World could be resolved, but the pressure from the outside world that the Pill Sun Sacred World was weak was very frightening.
