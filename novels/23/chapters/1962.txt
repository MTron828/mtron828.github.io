To conquer a sanctuary and become an overlord in Eternal Chaotic World, Great Emperor Colored Glaze wasn’t stupid.

Plus, she was pretty well-informed.

The war that had happened in Lineage of Star, she knew about it and she had naturally heard of the mysterious expert from ancient times, Emperor Thirteen.

He was a super expert and he was definitely related to Jian Wushuang. He absolutely wouldn’t allow Jian Wushuang to die.

Back then, Abysmal Saint Master had wanted to kill Jian Wushuang. In the end, Emperor Thirteen had popped up from nowhere. With one stroke, he had almost killed Abysmal Saint Master. His terrifying power was only stronger, not weaker than, Emperor Bai’s

She wasn’t even as strong as Abysmal Saint Master. Hence, she didn’t have the courage to kill Jian Wushuang.

As for what she had promised Sir God Xue Dao, she merely wanted Sir God Xue Dao wanted to lead her to Green Fire World. She had never thought of killing Jian Wushuang.

However, as long as she didn’t kill, merely trapped or suppressed, she believed that Emperor Thirteen wouldn’t find trouble with her.

“Jian Wushuang, do you want me to attack or do you want to make the choice on your own?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at Jian Wushuang coldly.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t angry but smiled, “Colored Glaze, you’re an old woman that has lived for God knows how many years. Aren’t you too arrogant?”

“What did you say?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s face grew grave.

Old woman? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang had said that she was an old woman and said that she was arrogant.

That was right. She had lived for many years and she was considered an old monster. However, she was a Great Emperor. Even the few Great Emperors on the same level as her didn’t dare to call her an old woman. Who the h*ll did Jian Wushuang think he was?

“Why? You didn’t hear that clearly? Do you want me to repeat it?” Jian Wushuang scoffed, “I said, you, an old woman, are too arrogant. I respected you and called you Great Emperor Colored Glaze. If I don’t, who the h*ll are you? Green Fire World is not a place for people of such a low standard as yourself!”

“If you are wise, hurry up and leave. Otherwise...”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned ice cold.

He didn’t want to act courteously with Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

“Courting death!!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze raged with anger.

A Great Emperor, a high and mighty existence in Eternal Chaotic World, how dare one offend her?

On top of that, not only had Jian Wushuang offended her, he had challenged and even humiliated her.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze couldn’t hold her anger back.

Rumble.

Boundless divine might soared from Great Emperor Colored Glaze and filled the universe.

Under such great divine might, even the void was quivering in madness as though it was shivering in fear.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s eyes were cold and her face was covered in frost. Her divine might spread and chilliness instantly covered the universe.

Hualala. Large chunks of void were frozen entirely. Around Great Emperor Colored Glaze, the surrounding void of hundreds of thousands of miles froze.

Jian Wushuang was the first to dash forward.

The shocking chilliness was almost freezing him to death.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t think that there’s a mysterious expert behind your back and I can’t do anything about you!”

Even though I can’t kill you, I can teach you a lesson at least. That’s something I can still do!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s cold voice reverberated in the universe. At the same time, her jade finger extended slowly.

Psst psst psst!!!

The cold ice in the air suddenly stirred and instantly formed three cones.

The three ice cones weren’t huge but contained a chilliness. It was enough to shock any Emperor God.

“Die!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s will moved.

The three ice cones charged at Jian Wushuang at lightning speed.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and felt the surrounding spacetime freeze. Even his divine body felt enormous pressure, it was extremely difficult when it came to movement. It would be unrealistic if he wanted to resist the three ice cones.

Plus, even if he really did block them, the power of a Great Emperor wasn’t something he could match with evenly.

However, there was no need for him to take action. Right when Great Emperor Colored Glaze, there was a flowing light that had plunged out from Green Fire World behind him.

Wow!

As the crimson cloud churned, Jian Yi appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Dealing with the three ice cones that burst out, Jian Yi slowly raised his hand. Without too much of a movement, he merely snapped his fingers in the direction that the three ice cones were flying from.

Pak! Pak! Pak!

The three ice cones burst out simultaneously and filled the air with shattered ice pieces.

The attack of Great Emperor Colored Glaze collapsed. At the same time, there was a crimson cloud that swept out from Jian Yi’s body, just like a crimson ocean that surged to the surroundings.

Jian Wushuang was engulfed in a crimson ocean and his movement resumed normal without any restriction.

“Jian Yi, well done,” Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Yi with a satisfied gaze.

“Thank you, master, for your compliment, “Jian Yi smiled and nodded. There was unprecedented enthusiasm in his eyes.

Looking at the sight, Great Emperor Colored Glaze in the nearby void looked shocked.

“Great Emperor?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at Jian Yi with a cold gaze.

She could feel that Jian Yi had divine power and an aura that wasn’t much weaker than hers. Besides, Jian Yi had attacked and instantly shattered her attack. Judging from the way he broke her frozen spacetime, Jian Yi was a true Great Emperor expert. In terms of power, he might not even be weaker than her.

“How could it be?”

“There are only so many Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World. Previously, there was Emperor Thirteen out of nowhere. Now, there was another one. Similarly, there was no sign at all?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze creased her eyebrows.

She didn’t know that Jian Yi was like Emperor Thirteen, they were all experts from ancient times.

And they were both from the nearby ancient battlefield.

Only Emperor Thirteen was more mysterious and he wasn’t under Jian Wushuang’s control. However, Jian Yi had been soul controlled by him long ago.

Soul controlled, Jian Yi naturally obeyed his command.

Previously, Jian Yi had been severely injured and he had never recovered his power.

Back during the war in Lineage of Star, Jian Yi had only recovered to peak Middle Stage Chaotic Realm but his fighting power was extremely close to Great Emperor. However, compared to Great Emperor, he was slightly weaker.

However, ever since Jian Wushuang had returned to Green Fire World, Jian Yi had continued to recover his power in seclusion. with the aid of Green Fire World’s current increasing spiritual influence of heaven and earth, his power was recovering at a terrifying rate. Twelve thousand years had passed and the current Jian Yi had yet to recover entirely and resumed the strongest status. However, he had already reached peak Chaotic Realm!

Peak Chaotic Realm equaled Great Emperor level in Eternal Chaotic World!
