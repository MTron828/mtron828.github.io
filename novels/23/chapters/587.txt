Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Having left the garden, Jian Wushuang saw Yang Zaixuan and Di Jing waiting for him outside. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Third Brother, I’ve asked Eldest Brother, Wang Yuan, to come here. Let’s have a good drink later,” said Yang Zaixuan.

“I’m afraid I can’t,” Jian Wushuang looked solemn. He shook his head and said, “Senior Emperor Xiao has just informed me that Sword Marquis Mansion is in danger. I have to get back immediately, otherwise, it will be destroyed.”

“Really?” Yang Zaixuan frowned. “Master is omnipotent. If he’s said that the Sword Marquis Mansion is in danger, you should definitely get back quickly.”

“Second Brother, please let our Eldest Brother Wang Yuan know about this,” Jian Wushuang answered anxiously. He looked at Di Jing and said, “Senior Di Jing, I have to go back to the Nanyang Continent now.”

“Sure, follow me,” Di Jing nodded and took Jian Wushuang to the castle.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang arrived at a secret chamber which held a huge wormhole.

“You can get back to the Tang Dynasty in the Nanyang Continent through this wormhole,” Di Jing said as he opened the wormhole for Jian Wushuang.

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang said and stepped into the wormhole. Waves reverberated in the space and soon, Jian Wushuang disappeared.

...

At the Nanyang Continent, a territory of Tang Dynasty.

The Tang Dynasty remained the same messy and violent Slaughterous Dynasty.

At this moment, two people were fighting to the death beside a huge nameless mountain in the Tang Dynasty.

The two people emitted Saint Realm auras, reflecting their status as Peak experts in the Nanyang Continent.

The fight between the two Saint Realm experts had attracted a large number of warriors, who stood around the battle and watched the fight intently.

No one knew of the existence of a wormhole in the huge nameless mountain. At the moment, the wormhole was aglow with light.

A short moment later, a human figure emerged from the wormhole and slowly walked forward along the tunnel.

Soon, this human figure came out from the cave.

“Nanyang Continent!”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, breathed the air and raised his head to look at the sky.

Suddenly...

“Die!”

A howl reverberated through the area. Jian Wushuang saw a huge blade light cut through the air. Its intended victim had been a Saint Realm elder, who had reacted quickly and avoided it. The power of the blade light had not subsided and continued to move towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had only just arrived at the Nanyang Continent and he was already being attacked.

Although the attack was weak for someone at his level, it still made him a bit angry.

“Get out!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed in rage, his face purple with fury.

His bellow sounded like a thunderclap that shocked the entire area and drowned out all other sounds.

The blade light which had slashed towards him was immediately destroyed. The purple-haired man who had launched the blade light and the Saint Realm elder were attacked by the bellow. It confused them and made them bleed from their eyes, noses and mouths.

Although they survived, both of them sustained serious injuries.

The two powerful Saint Realms wilted like plants in winter. They collapsed on the ground and did not rise again.

The ordinary warriors present covered their ears and most of them were shrieking in pain.

Abruptly, silence fell.

Countless terrified looks focused on Jian Wushuang.

The two Saint Realms struggled to stand as they stared at Jian Wushuang in terror.

They were well aware of the bellow’s power.

Jian Wushuang had shown them mercy. Otherwise, that bellow would have killed them.

“He, who is he?”

“His strength is so great that experts of the Saint Realm are infants compared to him. One bellow already carries enough power to seriously harm them.”

“This is a real Peak expert.”

The warriors present were in fervent discussion.

Jian Wushuang glanced around with an icy look and realized that the two Saint Realms had been fighting. They had not noticed his arrival, which resulted in him being inadvertently attacked.

With a better understanding of the situation,?his anger dissipated. He waved his hand and gave an elixir to each of the Saint Realms. Following this, there was a flash of Flowing Light and Jian Wushuang disappeared completely.

“This speed!”

“So fast!”

“He, who the hell is he?”

The Saint Realms stared at the elixirs with widened eyes.

They hesitated for a moment, then swallowed the elixirs. Soon, they noticed that their injuries were healed. The speed of recovery was rapid and it took only a short time for them to return to their previous conditions. In fact, they were at their peak conditions, or perhaps even better than that.

The terrifying skills, incredible speed and the magic elixir were clear evidence that the two Saint Realms had met a superior.

...

Having left the mountain, Jian Wushuang flew to the Sword Marquis Mansion.

Knowing that the Sword Marquis Mansion was in danger, he did not dare to tarry.

The Sword Marquis Mansion in the Tang Dynasty was a considerable distance from the Tianzong Dynasty. However, Jian Wushuang would be able to get there in less than one hour with his speed if he did not stop during his journey.

The Sword Marquis Mansion, Bashui Commandery, Tianyan province in the Tianzong Dynasty!

The Sword Marquis Mansion had gained fame in the Nanyang Continent when it had become common knowledge that Jian Wushuang, a peerless genius, hailed from the mansion. While the mansion had not produced experts in the last couple of years, it had the full support of the royal family from the Tianzong Dynasty and the tacit support of the Alchemy School. Its overall strength was still much greater than it had been and it had become the top power in the Tianzong Dynasty.

The Sword Marquis Mansion had been thriving, but that had changed dramatically a few days ago!

A powerful, mysterious expert had broken into the Sword Marquis Mansion and captured all its clansmen.
