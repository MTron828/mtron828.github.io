Chapter 1696: First Place On Real God Ranking List

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The curtain descended for the highly anticipated battle between Soaring Heaven King Palace and Lineage of Star after the deal on Thunderbolt Island.

In the battle, not only did Soaring Heaven King Palace suffer heavy losses, they became a laughing stock.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had gained a complete victory.

Especially the hundred thousand Doctrine Gems, demons cores and five hundred years of cultivation time in Fairy Palace. Everyone was envious.

On Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang gathered with many Real Gods of Lineage of Star.

“Real God Duan Yan, Real God Huan Yu, thank you for your help in the Eighth Lair. This small gift is just a token of gratitude, of my respect,” Jian Wushuang took out two Qian Kun rings.

“This…” Real God Duan Yan creased his eyebrows. He hesitated because the two of them actually hadn’t helped much during the battle. Jian Wushuang had defeated Soaring Heaven King Palace alone.

“As Jian Wushuang has offered it, we shall accept it. After all, he received quite an abundant reward from Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Real Got Huan Yu accepted it straight away.

“Mm, that’s true,” Real God Duan Yan beamed with joy and accepted it as well.

“Everyone else too,” Jian Wushuang took out some other Qian Kun rings for every expert from Lineage of Star.

The benefits that he had gotten from Soaring Heaven King Palace were shockingly great. It was only right and proper that he shared some with the experts in Lineage of Star.

After all, when he was in the dark region, the experts in Lineage of Star had helped to look for him.

Everyone took the Qian Kun rings and skimmed through with their consciousness. They were all surprised. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s small gift was priceless.

After everyone had left, Jian Wushuang took out a communication token to contact Hall Master Yuan.

“How did it go?” Hall Master Yuan had sent a message long ago.

“It went well. Soaring Heaven King Palace gave me the things,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I knew it,” Hall Master Yuan wasn’t surprised, “Although the things that you asked for are priceless, they are nothing to Real God Han Quan. Plus, there are so many people who knew that you imprisoned Real God Han Quan. If Soaring Heaven King Palace were to not take out those things willingly, the experts under their command would definitely be discouragingly disappointed.”

“Mm, true,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“This time, you have gained abundantly. But, honestly speaking, it was too risky. Luckily, everything went well. Otherwise…” Hall Master Yuan sighed.

“I never thought Soaring Heaven King Palace would want me dead so badly. To fight me, just a Real God, they even sent an Almighty. They are very cruel,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace did overdo it this time. It is a little unusual,” Hall Master Yuan said, then he shook his head. “Don’t bother with them. You only need to be careful with Soaring Heaven King Palace in the future. Oh yeah, Real God ranking list has been updated. You haven’t seen it yet, right?”

“They changed it so quickly?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“It was supposed to be changed after a while. But because of you, Vientiane Tower changed it ahead of time. After all, your sudden rise caused a great impact to Real God ranking list,” Hall Master Yuan paused and continued, “Do you know which rank you are at on the new Real God ranking list?”

“Should be in the top three, I’m guessing,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You’re in top three and… in the first place,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“The first place on Real God ranking list?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew that he would definitely be in the top three and he definitely could be in second place if not mistaken. However, he had never thought of being the first place on Real God ranking list.

After all, he had seen Real God ranking list and he also knew the fighting results of the first-placed on Real God ranking list.

Although he had had great results during his visit to the Eighth Lair and he had even injured Sir God Qian Land, it was because he had used many trump cards and Sir God Qian Lan hadn’t manage to perform any techniques in time. However, it didn’t mean he was stronger than Sir God Qian Lan.

On the contrary, if they were to fight with their all, Sir God Qian Lan might possibly have the upper hand.

As for the previous first-placed on Real God ranking list, it was in a situation where both parties were giving their all. He had suppressed an Almighty. In terms of fighting results, he was stronger by one notch than Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t think that he could move to the top of Real God ranking list, but in the end, he was wrong.

“Between Real God and Almighty, the difference is vast. There are many experts on Real God ranking list but who could be evenly matched with an Almighty besides Real God Fa Mie who was in the first place previously. He fought against an Almighty before. In terms of fighting result, he isn’t weaker than you. But Vientiane Tower listed you in the first place before Real God Fa Mie due to your potential.”

Hall Master Yuan smiled, “Real God Fa Pie became Chaotic Real God for very long. His power has reached a bottleneck. Unless he becomes an Almighty, it is impossible for him to increase his power. On the other hand, you are different. You are an inverse cultivator and your potential is much higher than Real God Fa Mie’s. Your space to grow on the stage as Real God is still terrifying huge.”

“Forget about the rest. As soon as you break through and become Chaotic Real God, it will be an easy task to win against Fa Mie.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

First place on Real God ranking list… Not long ago, he was in the first place on Universe God ranking list. Then, he had suddenly risen abruptly to a brand new level with such short notice.

With the encounter of first place on Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang didn’t feel anything about being the first place of Real God ranking list.

“An inverse cultivator isn’t someone an ordinary cultivator could compare to. Any inverse cultivator, no matter how low his comprehension of Power of Heaven Way is, as long as he reaches the level of stage three Ultimate Real God, the level of a Chaotic Real God, he could easily become the first place in Real God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang said in silence.

Just like Real God Wu Bei, he was also on the first place of Real God ranking list when he was an Ultimate Real God.

The only difference was that Jian Wushuang was only a stage-two Ultimate Real God while Real God Wu Bei only became number one when he was at stage three.

“In terms of power, I am slightly weaker than Real God Wu Bei,” Jian Wushuang knew it clearly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Jian Wushuang, make a plan to make a trip back to Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan suddenly said.

“Return to Lineage of Star?” Jian Wushuang thought and he nodded, “Sure.”

“When are you planning?” Hall Master Yuan asked closely.

“After some time, I guess. I have just gotten five hundred years of cultivation time from Soaring Heaven King Palace and many demon cores. These are extremely useful to me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay then. Go head and cultivate. Send me a message when you want to return,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he cut off the connection with Hall Master Yuan.

Then, Jian Wushuang naturally had to utilize the resources that he had obtained from Soaring Heaven King Palace.
