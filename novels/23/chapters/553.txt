Chapter 554: The Last Step!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ice-cold blade light from behind him stabbed towards his heart.

The attack had happened too quickly. When Jian Wushuang realized what was happening, the blade light had been less half a centimeter away him. It was too close to escape.

There was nowhere to run to.

“Since I can’t escape from it, let me face it!”

A crazy thought flashed in Jian Wushuang’s mind and he tried to face the incoming attack with his body. Immediately, his Spiritual Power surged and a strong Spiritual Power Shield surrounded his heart.

“Go to hell!” Emperor Golden Snake’s face was ferocious and his eyes were filled with strong killing intent. The sharp black scimitar stabbed Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Clang!

A clash resounded as power undulated violently in the air.

Almost immediately, heavy wind and a storm materialized.

Experts outside the Restriction stared at the battlefield’s center.

There, the Eight ‘Emperor Golden Snake’s had become one. Emperor Golden Snake’s Original Body held on tightly to his black scimitar with its blade pushed against Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Space and time froze.

Everything stopped.

“Wh, what?”

Emperor Golden Snake’s resentful eyes were full of astonishment now.

He looked at Jian Wushuang’s back in shock. Jian Wushuang’s clothes had been torn, revealing a Scarlet Leather Armor.

This was the Blood Kylin Leather Armor that Jian Wushuang had obtained in Heaven Wing City. Though Blood Kylin Leather Armor was hard, it had still been pierced by the black scimitar.

Having gotten past the armor, the black scimitar would have pierced Jian Wushuang’s heart. However, it had stopped when upon entering Jian Wushuang’s flesh.

Stuck in Jian Wushuang’s flesh and blood, the black scimitar couldn’t move forward.

It was as though a barrier had stopped the black scimitar.

“This, this…”

Experts outside the Restriction were stunned.

Emperor Golden Snake’s most powerful move had merely injured Jian Wushuang’s skin.

The scimitar had not gone deeper.

“What a powerful body!”

Everyone, including the Temple Masters, were shocked.

Though they had completed Bone Fusion Technique’s Level Nine, they believed that they would be dead if they had to face a similar attack from Emperor Golden Snake.

But Jian Wushuang, a Saint Realm, had not died.

Such a powerful body!

They didn’t know that Jian Wushuang had not only mastered Bone Fusion Technique’s Level Nine, but more importantly, he had practiced Heavenly Creation Skill.

He had reached Venerable Master level. What differentiated him from the others was his powerful body.

Beside his strong outer body, every muscle, bone and cell of his body was much stronger than a normal person.

The scimitar had broken his Spiritual Power Shield, Blood Kylin Leather Armor and even his skin, but it couldn’t go any deeper. For the scimitar to pierce Jian Wushuang’s heart, Emperor Golden Snake’s offensive power would need to be twice what it was now.

Over the void, Emperor Golden Snake had backed off with a look of disbelief.

Jian Wushuang, who was now attracting many incredulous stares, closed his eyes.

“Why did he close his eyes?”

“He closed his eyes?”

“What is he doing?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Is he trying to recover from the injury?”

The onlookers were puzzled. Some guessed he was trying to recover as he was heavily wounded.

Only Jian Wushuang knew that their guesses were wrong.

He had fended off the attacks perfectly and had not suffered any serious injuries.

He closed his eyes because Enlightenment had entered his mind.

Yes, it was Enlightenment.

While facing Emperor Golden Snake’s scimitar, he had a sense of crisis and had tried his best to fend it off.

Then Enlightenment appeared.

Level 1 Restriction of Six-story Pagoda had 999 Slaughter Occult. Jian Wushuang had mastered 998.

The last one had always troubled him.

Now, he finally understood it.

“I finally understand.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Madness in a?hopeless situation!

The sudden enlightenment helped Jian Wushuang master the last Slaughter Occult.

Jian Wushuang now understood all 999 Slaughter Occult of level 1 Restriction of Six-story Pagoda.

With the new understanding, he unlocked level 1 Restriction and found its inner rule.

”?That’s it. That’s why Master Di Jing said that I would enter Dao as long as I unlocked level 1?Restriction.?It’s the way from Slaughter Origin to Slaughter Dao.”Jian Wushuang smiled softly.

By unlocking the Restriction, he had finished his last step to enter Dao.

Soon, Slaughter Origin turned into Slaughter Dao and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The process went smoothly.

In a short moment, the process was completed.

Onlookers saw Jian Wushuang close his eyes but didn’t know what he was doing.

Emperor Golden Snake clenched his fists. He had a diabolical look on his face.

“Impossible!”

He shouted and the eight ‘Emperor Golden Snake’ reappeared and rushed towards Jian Wushuang.
