Chapter 1374: Unfortunate Experience in the Milky Way

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Cultivation time waited for no man!

To those experts at the top of the Eternal Chaotic World, such as Almighty like the founder of Lineage of Star, ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years were all like the snap of his fingers.

A million years was merely a blink of an eye.

Tens of million of years wasn’t long either.

However, to Jian Wushuang that had yet to cultivate for ten thousand years, he could do many things in eight hundred years.

It was his one-hundred-and-twentieth year in Lineage of Star.

Star Tower, first floor.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Rays of swordlight swept out magically from Jian Wushuang continuously.

Those sword lights were beautiful, and every ray was enchanting.

His opponent, the middle-aged man with a long beard, wielded his sword. He was quick, accurate and brutal. He was extremely decisive in his moves.

Both of their swordsmanships were exposed entirely and their swords collided over and over again.

The collision of their sword lights reverberated through Star Tower.

There was suddenly a sharp glare in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Billows!”

Gush!

There was a boundless sword light that exploded. It looked like there was at least a thousand rays of sword lights.

The sword lights looked blurry and no one could tell which was real.

“Break!”

The middle-aged man bellowed and twitched. It slammed the core of the sword light like lightning and collided with the tip of the Blood Mountain Sword

“Ghosting!”

The divine power in Jian Wushuang’s hand surged, and boundless sword lights overlapped one another as though thousand rays of sword light had gathered into one and suddenly erupted.

“What?”

The long-bearded middle-aged man looked astonished but he couldn’t dodge in time and was hit by the sword light directly.

The first floor of Star Tower, passed!

“Finally passed!”

There was joy in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

When he first got to Star Tower, he was defeated by the long-bearded middle-aged man directly. He was far from passing the floor.

However, one hundred and twenty years later, although he had yet to create an advanced rank three unique skill, with the two beginner rank three unique skills and with his understanding of swordsmanship and killing technique, he had passed through the first floor of Star Tower.

“In Lineage of Star, most of the ordinary disciples who are Universe God in the Second Heaven could only pass through the first floor of Star Tower. I am barely even-handed with but not at the bottom like before,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

On the day Jian Wushuang passed through the first level of Star Tower, the news spread.

Like a gentle breeze, there was not much response.

Merely passing the first floor wasn’t enough to catch the disciples’ attention. If Jian Wushuang could pass through the second floor of the Star Tower, that might catch their attention.

“The Meta strength that I obtained earlier finished. I have to catch a few Meta beasts for supplementation!”

Jian Wushuang walked directly to the Milky Way after he left Star Tower.

In the boundless Milky Way, Jian Wushuang wandered leisurely as his Soul Power spread.

Soon, Jian Wushuang found his first Meta beast.

“Oh, a three meter tall Meta beast?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes blinked.

A hundred and twenty years ago, the first time he came to catch a Meta beast it was also a three meter tall Meta beast. But then, he couldn’t do anything about it and could only let it go.

But now…

Jian Wushuang immediately moved and suppressed the Meta beast’s speed with Blaze Quicksand Gourd. He caught up with it and took swift action. In a short time, the Meta beast was caught alive.

“First.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and continued to wander around,

Ten days passed. In the past ten days, Jian Wushuang had caught twenty-two Meta beast to extract a large amount of Meta strength.

“With the Meta strength that I extracted, it should be enough for me to cultivate for a few years in Reset Palace. Let me catch one last one,” Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

Half an hour later, Jian Wushuang found his last Meta beast.

“Quite a fat little one, huh?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Meta beast which was huge and almost four meters tall, he was impressed.

There were many Meta beasts in the Milky Way. However, as the disciples in Lineage of Star always extracted their Meta strength from them, there were very few that could reach four meters tall. Previously, Jian Wushuang had only come across one.

Rumble!

Jian Wushuang took action directly.

The Blaze Quicksand Gourd suppressed the Meta beast while he wielded Blood Mountain Sword and formed a boundless sword intention to cover the Meta beast.

Wow! Wow! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A mere collision twice, as he was worried that he would hurt the Meta beast, Jian Wushuang intentionally hit the Meta beast’s body with the body of Blood Mountain Sword. However, in the end, the Meta beast retreated madly.

“Little one, don’t struggle,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The four-meter-tall Meta beast could tell that he couldn’t win against the human attacker, so it started running madly. Even though it was within the scope of Blaze Quicksand Gourd, it still showed shocking speed.

“It looks like I’ll need to put in some effort,” Jian Wushuang sighed. The four-meter-tall Meta beast was obviously more difficult to deal with than expected.

However, just as Jian Wushuang prepared to chase the Meta beast, there was a figure that appeared before the Meta beast. Then, there was a hand that swept like lightning and slapped the Meta beast. The fierce force caused the Meta beast to groan in pain. Then, the figure took action again and caught the Meta beast easily.

Jian Wushuang moved and came before the figure.

“Qu Yang, it’s you?” Jian Wushuang looked at the person before him calmly.

He had a good impression of Qu Yang. After all, Qu Yang was the one who brought had him around to the Lineage of Star back then.

“Jian Wushuang?” Qu Yang took a glance at Jian Wushuang in disdain.

“Thank you for blocking the Meta beast for me. Otherwise, It would take a while for me to catch it,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Blocking it for you? Hehe, I think you misunderstood the situation.” Qu Yang looked cold and his voice was low, “Although you were the one who saw the Meta beast first, the person who caught it is me. The Meta beast is naturally mine, and you… You’d better stay far away!”

“Stay far away?” Jian Wushuang was stunned but he sneered in his heart, “Qu Yang didn’t know my power back then but only treated me with passion because I am a disciple of Star Palace. But everyone knows about my power now. Qu Yang has taken such an attitude to me. What a realistic person.

Although Jian Wushuang sneered, he didn’t care. He had been used to it for a long time.

“Why? What are you doing here? Can’t you hear me?” Qu Yang glared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Hurry up and leave!”

“Otherwise, don’t blame me!”
