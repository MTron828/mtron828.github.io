2274 Solo Confrontation

“Elder Shehua, it is Elder Shehua!”

“Oh my god!”

The divine demons from the ancient past were stunned.

Saint Soul was only a top tier Undying Saint, but Elder Shehua was a legend in the Undying Saint Realm.

She was extremely old and had been very famous within the Absolute Beginning Divine World even before Saint Soul started cultivating.

She was known as one of the most terrifying Undying Saints.

No one knew how powerful she really was as she rarely engaged in combat.

Even Saint Soul was weaker than Elder Shehua.

“Haha. I never thought that there would still be youngsters who remembered me after so many years.” Elder Shehua smiled. Her eyes radiated coldness.

“Watch out!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A loud yell was heard.

Just when the experts from the ancient past were taking some precautions, a silver ray of light streaked across the battlefield.

It was so fast that the three experts from the ancient past died without having any time to react.

A hole appeared in their chests. Their divine bodies withered before they could cry out as it turned into dead bodies instantly.

“Hiss~~~”

The experts from the ancient past took a sharp and cold breath.

They looked at the silver ray of light, which was now sitting on the shoulder of Elder Shehua, in surprise. It was a small, silver snake with light spots. It was this snake which had killed three experts from the ancient past instantly and sucked their bodies dry.

“It is Elder Shehua’s snake, Flower God. It is extremely venomous. Legend has it that if you ever come into contact with its poison, you will become a dead, withered corpse immediately. Looks like the legends were true,” one of the experts from the ancient past said in shock.

There were other experts who came along with Saint Soul and Elder SheHua.

They too attacked.

They were recognized immediately when they used their incredible fighting power.

“Saint Ice Flame, Old Monster Mang, Emperor Man...”

These were famous people back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World and all of them stood in front of these experts from the ancient past.

There were top tier experts from the Seven Star Black Sect, the weakest of them was in the Undying Saint Realm.

The only people from the Seven Star Black Sect who had survived the Great Battle of the Ancient Past were in the Undying Saint Realm. Anyone weaker than that got massacred.

These experts had also gone into deep slumber within this Heaven and Earth and had just awakened today.

Even though they had the advantage in terms of numbers, the experts from the ancient past were all extremely cautious and frightened when they were fighting against these ten experts in the Undying Saint Realm.

There were mere Divine Demons. Even if some of them were in realms more powerful than that, they were still far away from the Undying Saint Realm.

In their primes, any one of these Undying Saints would have been able to massacre them easily.

Even though they were under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the fighting power they had were still much greater than the Divine Demons from the ancient past.

When these ten Undying Saints entered the battlefield, the tide of the battle turned instantly.

“Little one, we can handle these people. Go and do what you need to do,” Elder Shehua looked over at Jian Wushuang and said after she killed another Divine Demon.

“Thank you, fellow seniors,” Jian Wushuang thanked them gratefully.

“No problem.” Elder Shehua waved her hand and said.

Jian Wushuang turned and left without hesitation.

Previously, the experts from the ancient past had had him preoccupied and not given him any chance to leave.

But now, Elder Shehua and the other experts came and stopped these experts from the ancient past. Jian Wushuang was now free to do as he wished.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure blinked and he appeared in front of Leng Ruxue and Bing Shan instantly.

Jian Wushuang scanned the Heaven’s Horizon behind him and realised the passageway had almost completely opened. However, it had yet to stabilize.

“There is still time,” Jian Wushuang thought as he clenched his fists tightly.

Bing Shan turned pale when he saw Jian Wushuang appear in front of him. He immediately stood in front of Leng Ruxue and said, “Sword Emperor. If you want to stop Palace Master Leng, you will have to pass through me first.”

A ray of killing intent flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes. However, before he could attack, another voice was heard.

“Haha. Bing Shan, you have the audacity to interrupt the private matters of two youngsters?”

A hearty laugh boomed as a figure appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

It was an elder who seemed peaceful. It was One Star Man!

“Senior One Star Man,” Jian Wushuang said in greeting. He was not surprised when One Star Man appeared.

He knew that One Star Man was the one who had called experts like Elder Shehua over to help.

“One Star Man, is it you?” Bing Shan looked over at One Star Man with a serious expression.

There had been many powerful experts in the Seven Star Black Sect back in its prime.

The most famous of them all were the Seven Stars, which represented seven top tier experts. The strongest among them was Emperor Thirteen, who could have gone against even the Master of Holy Land.

The other six might not be as powerful as Emperor Thirteen, but they were all very close to the Master of Holy Land Realm. Even though Bing Shan and these people were similar in the realms they were in, their fighting power was far inferior.

Any one of the seven stars could wreck him in a battle.

Even though the One Star Man was not part of the Seven Stars, Bing Shan knew well that One Star Man was very close to him in terms of fighting power. He was a candidate to be one of them. He was definitely a fierce enemy.

“Bing Shan, your opponent today is me. I will not let you hinder these two little ones,” One Star Man smiled and said with absolute confidence.

Bing Shan’s face turned dark.

He knew how powerful One Star Man was. If One Star Man gave it his all to stop him, there was no way he could divert his attention and care about Leng Ruxue.

The other experts from the ancient past were all busy dealing with people like Elder Shehua. There was no way they could help out.

This meant that Leng Ruxue had to face Jian Wushuang alone.

However, Jian Wushuang was extremely powerful.

Leng Ruxue interrupted Bing Shan’s thoughts as she said, “Lord Bing Shan. You can put all your attention on One Star Man. There is no need to worry about me.”

“What? Palace Master Leng...” Bing Shan knitted his eyebrows and was about to continue when Leng Ruxue interrupted him again.

“Lord Bing Shan, you are underestimating me. Do not forget, I am my Master’s lineal disciple,” Leng Ruxue waved at him and said.
