Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“Let’s fight!”

With a low roar, Jian Wushuang rushed out.

“You’re courting death!”

The Flame Saint Master was extremely powerful. The moment he saw Jian Wushuang, he waved his hand.

Boom! A scorching aura surged out. A huge sea of fire appeared in the void in front of the Flame Saint Master. In this sea of fire, scorching scarlet-golden flames were burning fiercely, the space was easily burned. When the surrounding experts saw the scarlet-golden sea of fire, they could not help but shudder.

They felt that even a wisp of scarlet-golden flames from the scarlet-golden sea of fire could easily burn a Principles Master to ashes. But now, this huge sea of fire...it covered Jian Wushuang completely.

“Break!”

The sea of fire attacked. Jian Wushuang spat out a word and slashed down with his Blood Mountain Sword.

This sword was not very powerful, but at the moment it was slashed...

Whoosh!

The sword light instantly passed through the entire sea of fire.

A path had been cut open in the huge sea of fire, and a large amount of scarlet-gold flame swept out in all directions.

In the split path of the sea of fire, a figure flashed past, and Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Flame Saint Master.

“Ninth firmament illusionary sword realm!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

There were nine sword glows, each of which was extremely fast and carried a shocking power as they slashed toward Flame Saint Master.

Flame Saint Master’s eyes were cold as he wielded the long golden staff in his hand.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of clanging sounds rang out as the two collided nine times in an instant.

After the nine collisions, the flames on Flame Saint Master’s body had dimmed significantly. His body also retreated rapidly. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang did not stop at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“In terms of power, I’m stronger than him!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

After the first exchange, he had already realized that he was stronger than Flame Saint Master purely in terms of power.

“Ruler-level!” Flame Saint Master narrowed his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang. “This kid really has the power of a ruler. Although I have the power of the will of heaven, there is still a gap between me and a ruler-level. However, this kid only has strength, but in terms of his absolute arts and techniques, he can’t be compared to a real ruler!”

“As long as I’m not stupid enough to fight him head-on, I can easily crush him!”

A cold light flashed in Flame Saint Master’s eyes. In the next moment, the sea of scarlet-gold fire swept toward Jian Wushuang again.

However, under the guidance of Flame Saint Master, the sea of scarlet-gold fire seemed to come to life and was completely ‘alive’.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Golden-red pillars of fire extended out from the sea of fire. Each pillar of fire was like a chain, crazily attacking Jian Wushuang from all directions. Jian Wushuang immediately brandished his sword to defend himself.

Although he could directly defeat these golden-red pillars of fire with the power of his swordsmanship, there were many of them. Moreover, they were very fast and flexible. One of them was defeated, more fire pillars immediately formed around Jian Wushuang, forcing him into a very difficult situation.

While Jian Wushuang was completely suppressed by the fire pillars, a strange figure suddenly appeared behind him. It was the Flame Saint Master, who had already merged into the sea of fire, the Flame Saint Master waved the long red-gold staff with one hand, and in an instant, it smashed toward Jian Wushuang’s divine body like a bolt of golden lightning.

“Oh no!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He had already sensed the astonishing power coming from behind him. He immediately turned around and blocked the Blood Mountain Sword with great difficulty, ignoring the strikes of the scarlet-gold fire pillars in front of him.

Bang!

With a loud sound, both of Jian Wushuang’s arms went numb, and his body shook. His Qi and blood churned, and he retreated in a sorry state. It took him a long time to regain his balance.

“Haha, boy, although you have obtained a power comparable to that of a ruler through the Blood Wave Realm, you only have the power of your own body. Your comprehension of the principles, the understanding of the Dao, and the skills you have created are still at the level of the Immortal Saint. It’s like having a peerless sword that can cut through iron like mud, but in the hands of an infant, you can’t use it!”

“You only have your strength now, but you can’t use it perfectly. Under such circumstances, it’s easy for me to kill you!” Flame Saint Master sneered, he merged into the crimson-gold sea of fire again.

The crimson-gold sea of fire surged toward Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened as he looked around coldly. “Flame Saint Master is right. Although I have invincible power above the Principles Master, I can’t use it fully with my strength...”

“I can’t compete with Flame Saint Master. I can only rely on brute force to suppress him!”

Jian Wushuang had already made up his mind. Just as the scarlet-gold sea of fire was sweeping toward him, he suddenly retreated.

While he was retreating, a series of special hand seals were struck out.

“Mountain River Map...Mountain River as palm, nine regions as seal!”

“True Emperor Seal!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes burst with a fierce light.

Boom!

The world suddenly shook.

In the highest part of the sky, the scroll world formed by the Mountain River Map had always existed. At this moment, a supreme power slowly condensed from the scroll world.

This power could only be described as shocking.

The moment this power began to condense, the countless experts watching the battle below all raised their heads in horror.

At this moment, they felt a terrifying power that terrified them, as if they were about to be completely annihilated by the power!

Then, a huge handprint slowly descended from the scroll world.

Nine-region seal!

It was one of the secret skills of the Mountain River Map.

The Mountain River Map was a top-tier universe supreme treasure, and its secret skill was extremely powerful. It was only because Jian Wushuang was too weak before, he could not fully display the power of these secret skills.

But now it was different. Although his realm was not very high, the power he had now was at the ruler level!
