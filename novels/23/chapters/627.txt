Chapter 628: An Invitation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the top floor of Skyward Pavilion, in the room on the left, were the people of the Immortal Dynasty.

Among them, a middle-aged man with matted hair who was sitting straight in his chair, with two files at hand. His eyebrows revealed his rebellious character.

After he glanced through one of the files, the one containing the information on the geniuses from Eternal World, he nodded and exclaimed, “Some of these youngsters are really outstanding.”

“Your Excellency, should we send them an invitation in advance?” A white-robed man standing beside him asked respectfully.

“No, let’s wait a little longer,” the middle-aged man replied.

From the very beginning to the end, he never even cast a glance at the other file. The geniuses from the Ancient World were completely ignored.

At the same time, in the room of the Boundless Demon Sect, a girl was reading a file as well. She looked quite young, but her aura was evil and terrifying. When she finished reading the information on the geniuses from the Eternal World, she turned to the file on those from the Ancient World.

“The man named Feng has performed well, but he will, at best, only make it within the top 20.” She curled her lips and put the file away casually.

It seemed that none of the three magnates had really been interested in Jian Wushuang and the others that came from the Ancient World.

What’s worse, the same was true of the top sects as well.

They did not believe that there were real geniuses in the Ancient World.

However, being less competitive than the top sects, the middle-sized and small sects had decided to target those who were less favored.

“The genius Feng, despite being from the Ancient World, is really something and may even make it to the top 20 in the Firmament Territory Feast. Send him an invitation saying that we want to accept him as our disciple.” An order was given out by the Luotian Sect.

“Send Feng an invitation and tell him we’re willing to have an Eternal Realm expert teach him in person.” Another order came out from the Ice Fire Sect.

“The man named Huo Ying is really impressive and can probably survive the second round. Tell him our Sky Shadow Temple is willing to accept him as an inner disciple.”

“Bing Shan is excellent.”

Those invitations from the middle-sized and small sects went to the outstanding geniuses from the Ancient World in succession.

While all the geniuses were gathered in the Drill Ground, some men dressed in white robes would arrive and give the geniuses from the Eternal World an invitation from time to time.

As for those from the Ancient World, like Jian Wushuang, they had received some invitations as well, but all of them were from the middle-sized and small sects.

“Jian Wushuang.” A man came to him and said, “Here is an invitation from our Mohuo Sect. If you accept it then you will be an inner disciple and one of our Divine Realm experts will teach you in person.”

“Understood, thanks!” Jian Wushuang simply nodded without giving a definite answer.

“This is a Message Token from the Divine Realm expert Jiu Ye. Once you’ve decided to accept our invitation, you can contact him through it.”

Jian Wushuang accepted the token and put it in his Interspatial Ring without taking a careful look at it.

He was not interested in joining a powerless sect where the strongest person was a Divine Realm expert.

The invitation might not appeal to Jian Wushuang, but it did to many others who looked at Jian Wushuang with envy.

Some of them had only received an invitation from the small sects and could only be outer disciples, while some had not even been invited once.

Therefore, being an inner disciple of the Mohuo Sect and having a Divine Realm expert as a master was a very satisfying prospect to them.

“So far, I’ve received four invitations, three from small sects as an inner disciple and one from a middle-sized sect as an outer disciple.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head in secret, but he was not discouraged.

After all, he had yet to show his real power in the three rounds of this genius battle.

He was sure that he would receive many better offers after the second and third round.

Feng was the origin of his confidence in that. After demonstrating his power, Feng had received a dozen invitations from the middle-sized sects, even a top sect had offered him a place as one of their outer disciples.

As the people on the Drill Ground continued waiting, in the center room on the third floor of Skyward Pavilion, a white-robed man stood with two files in his hand

The man had been waiting there for the past seven days for the experts who were supposed to be in the room.

“It’s been seven days, but no one has come.”?The man was quite bothered and helpless.

He was waiting for the representatives of the Ancient Sect to come.

He knew very well that, just as everyone who had ever adventured in the Firmament Territory knew, even though the Ancient Sect was less powerful than the three magnates, they would be harder to deal with than those three.

Right then, whoosh! A figure suddenly appeared in the room as if it appeared out of thin air.

The waiting man was startled inside as he looked toward the newcomer.

It was a tall man, more than two meters in height, with a gentle look and purple hair. The man wore a charming smile on his face and was standing with both hands behind his back.

Towering like a mountain! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

That’s the impression he gave to others.

He showed a smile at the man who was waiting for him and apologized. “Sorry, I’m late.”

The waiting man was so surprised that his eyes opened wide when he finished getting a clear look at the newcomer.

“Master... Xuan Yi?”
