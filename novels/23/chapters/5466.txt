Chapter 5465 ¬†Divine General

In an era that propelled them to the pinnacle, these tier 5 Emperors were not inferior in talent compared to others.

The paths they could take were extensive and challenging.

Unlike Yan Immortals and Grand Yan Immortals who entered the Qishen Temple from a young age, enjoying the temple's protection throughout their journey, establishing a solid foundation.

This era belonged to them.

It was an era flourishing with the Ultimate Dao, and with the cultivation from the Qishen Temple, a large number of Ultimate Emperors would emerge. Among these ultimate Emperors, as long as two or three became Universe Masters, the Qishen Temple could venture into more powerful timelines, restoring the ancient glory.

This was what Zhen Ling wished to see!

Although Jian Wushuang and his companions were unaware, they understood that the enormous resources invested in their cultivation would eventually need to be repaid.

Apart from these practitioners of the Ultimate Dao, a large number of Emperors were emerging as well, forming the backbone of their strength.

In the past, the Qishen Temple was filled with formidable individuals.

In the past, the Qishen Temple was filled with formidable individuals.

It was not something that a few Universe Masters could suppress.

Just the most powerful direct force under the Qishen's banner, the strengths of the three Divine Masters deities alone could overthrow the Three Kings Courts. There were also 18 Divine Generals, each rumored to be supreme-peak powerhouses among Ultimate Emperors.

Besides these, there were some Universe Masters sent on external missions and extraordinary Emperors.

They dominated countless universes, traversing the entire timeline.

Such power!

Jian Wushuang's gaze sank, knowing that the other party had not yet gone to the Grave God Mountain and not wanting to say too much, he shifted the topic, "Senior, when did this palace appear on the top of the Demon Sound Mountain, and what does the Demon Sound Divine General signify?"

"When I arrived, this palace was already here. I heard it was built later. There is a remarkable presence here, responsible for suppressing the Demon Sound Mountain's formidable existence!" said Emperor Zhutian, his eyes showing a longing expression.

In the past, with lofty aspirations, he had been pursuing the position of the Universe Master. However, upon arriving at the Qishen Temple and witnessing numerous formidable figures, he realized how naive his ambitions were.

Becoming the Universe Master was an arduous task.

In this lifetime, reaching the pinnacle realm was considered commendable.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised. Initially, even Shan Jun was not powerful enough to sit in control here. How had a formidable figure appeared now?

And he was known as the Demon Sound Divine General!

This individual was likely one of the 18 Divine Generals of the Qishen Temple. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even Guangmu Tianzun was still alive, so these Divine Generals might indeed still exist.

However, he was unaware that in the Western Sea, Fuego emerged and gathered with Shen Ling. Meanwhile, Zhen Ling personally intervened but couldn't find their traces. Although Fuego no longer possessed the power of the Universe Master, he was still not an opponent that an ordinary supreme-peak expert could handle.

Even with the realization of spatial cosmos by Shang, who was already a supreme-peak expert, he was no match for Fuego.

Within the Qishen Temple, apart from Zhen Ling, it was likely that no one could stop Fuego.

Zhen Ling had to guard the Origin Source Sea, the most crucial location in the Qishen Temple. Zhen Ling couldn't leave freely, especially now that Fuego had emerged.

So, Zhen Ling summoned the resurrected Demon Sound Divine General, one of the 18 Divine Generals, from God's Tomb. The revived Demon Sound Divine General then took residence on the Demon Sound Mountain in the Elder Palace.

"I wonder if we can go in?" Jian Wushuang asked cautiously.

Emperor Zhutian had a longing look and said heavily, "You can go in, but the cost of entry is very high. So far, no one has been able to get in!"

The key was what benefits there were after entering, and this was Jian Wushuang's concern.

Emperor Zhutian wanted to visit those powerful beings inside, seeking guidance for himself.

For these tier 5 Emperors, the tier 6 Emperors they had encountered in their lives were not as numerous as those seen by Jian Wushuang in a single day. After arriving at the Elder Palace, they found that the tier 6 Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms were not superior in terms of cultivation realm.

There was not much difference from those of the same tier, and the tier 6 Emperors of the Elder Palace were scarce. Those Emperors didn't even look at these tier 5 Emperors who hadn't even been to God's Tomb.

Most of the tier 6 Emperors of the Elder Palace would recruit some promising Inheritors from God's Tomb as their disciples.

The Azure Dragon Temple, which was not in charge, had almost had all its Inheritor Emperors taken by the Elder Palace. The remaining few had to go to the White Tiger Temple.

The weakness was going to the Vermilion Bird Temple in the Original Realm, where the treasures were abundant, but the tasks were intricate. It required venturing into other universes to plunder Yan Immortals and Grand Yan Immortals, which was also highly perilous.

The Azure Dragon Palace was the poorest, offering little benefit and having nothing significant to do. It was visited the least, and those who went to the Azure Dragon Temple on the Bloodthirsty Continent were mostly idlers.

Among the Four Temples, only the Black Tortoise Temple did not accept Inheritors. This was common knowledge among all Inheritors. Those who wanted to actively join had no way forward.

The presence of the Black Tortoise Temple was too low, and no one had even seen it.

Jian Wushuang asked again, "Senior, is the cost to enter paid in godstones?"

Zhutian shook his head. If it were godstones, they could easily plunder some from the Heavenly Realm, and entering would not be difficult. The key was that entering required strength.

"To enter, the first challenge is to comprehend the complete Universe Origin Source of this universe. Only by obtaining the token can one enter the Demon Sound Hall." Zhutian took out a token. He had obtained it not long ago. Many tier 5 Emperors on the mountaintop had acquired it. It wasn't too difficult, as long as one could reach the mountaintop and cultivate for a while.

Jian Wushuang looked at the token, which contained the power of the universe Origin Source on top, and the characters 'Demon Sound' were engraved on it.

"Don't worry too much; this is just a token to knock on the door!" Zhutian said, and at that moment, a humanoid beast-headed tier 5 Emperor in the distance stood up.

Zhutian looked at the beast-like figure and smiled faintly. "Brother Dongsheng, are you confident?"

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang also looked at the tier 5 God Emperor named Dongsheng. It was the first time he had heard this name.

It seemed to be a tier 5 Emperor from the Original Universe, but the name was unfamiliar. He should be a relatively ancient tier 5 Emperor.

"Tsk tsk, unlike you guys, always looking dejected. Such a good opportunity, and you don't seize it properly!" As he spoke, his figure began to change, and the scales on his body became denser.

As he approached the door of the Demon Sound Hall, he casually took out a token and tossed it towards the hall‚Äîa true door opener.

Jian Wushuang scrutinized it carefully. Though Zhutian next to him seemed indifferent, his eyes still narrowed slightly.

All of them had arrived at this place simultaneously, attempting countless times. Most of them had lost patience and descended the mountain.

While the Demon Sound Mountain was indeed unique, it wasn't the only treasure land. This place wasn't suitable for unnecessary head-on clashes. It was more practical to change locations; time was crucial for them.

Now, the younger generation had caught up with them.

Demon Lord Fengyu, Zhen Wuyang, Chishui, Tongtian Buddha‚Äîthey were all peak-level tier 5 Emperor, each possessing eternal treasures and formidable legacies, surpassing them in strength.

Watching these juniors, who had surpassed them in a mere few hundred thousand years, inevitably stirred some complex feelings in their hearts.
