Chapter 659: Three Sword Scars

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I just arrived at the Ancient Sect and this is my first time inside the Sword Palace, so I don’t know about anything. Would you mind telling me what this is all about?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sure,” Zhu Lie briskly replied. “Actually the Sword Palace is a place where numerous disciples in the Ancient Sect explore Sword Principle. There are two Vice Palace Masters and one Palace Master who usually give public lectures at Martial Arts Practice Field. Sometimes they even show us their swordsmanship. Today happens to be a day when Vice Palace Master Nie gives his lectures.”

“The Palace Master of Sword Palace, Palace Master Xuan Yi, who has a very powerful cultivation in Sword Principle that has already reached great heights, also occasionally give lectures. However, If you want to attend his lectures, you must meet certain requirements.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Senior Brother, please follow me.”

Zhu Lie led Jian Wushuang and they quickly reached a huge pavilion inside Sword Palace.

“This is Sword Tower, it’s where Palace Master Xuan Yi gives lectures,” said Zhu Lie.

Jian Wushuang looked up at the huge pavilion before him and secretly nodded.

“Senior Brother, look here,” Zhu Lie pointed towards a dark stone tablet in front of the pavilion.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the stone tablet and his expression changed abruptly.

He immediately noticed that there were three distinct sword scars on the dark stone tablet. These three sword scars were deeply engraved, placed together from top to bottom.

Jian Wushuang looked at these three sword scars and his pupil suddenly shrunk.

He realized that these three sword scars were profoundly delicate.

“What are the sword scars for?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I just said that there are some requirements for attending the lectures of Palace Master Xuan Yi, and the requirement is related to the three sword scars which were placed here by Palace Master Xuan Yi. The rules, which were set by Palace Master Xuan Yi, are that only disciples in the Ancient Sect who can fully comprehend the first sword scar are qualified to attend his lectures in Sword Tower,” said Zhu Lie.

“And, anyone who is able to fully comprehend the second sword scar is qualified to be apprenticed to Palace Master Xuan Yi as his nominal disciple.”

“If you fully comprehend the third sword scar, you can be his personal disciple!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned odd when Zhu Lie said that.

As long as I fully comprehend the third sword scar, I can be his personal disciple?

“Is it difficult?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s far more than just difficult!” Zhu Lie commented emotionally, “I regard myself as being gifted in Sword Principle. However, it’s been more than ten years since I came to the Ancient Sect and entered Sword Palace. I’ve meditated on the three sword scars from the very beginning until now, but I’ve only just now fully comprehended the first sword scar. Isn’t it difficult?”

“Also, the first sword scar is the easiest while the second and third are much harder to meditate on. It’s said that just the second sword scar is ten times harder than the first one.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“It’s because of its difficulty that there are less than 20 disciples who are qualified to attend his lectures, and there are only three nominal disciples who have fully comprehend the second sword scar and become apprenticed to Palace Master Xuan Yi. They have all stayed at Sword Palace for hundreds of years, comprehending the sword scars and attending the lectures of Palace Master Xuan Yi.” Zhu Lie said.

“Even though I’ve fully comprehended the first sword scar, I don’t know how long it will take me to comprehend the second.”

After hearing that, Jian Wushuang remained silent for a while and then asked, “Since the second sword scar is so difficult, how about the third one?”

“It’s even more difficult!” Zhu Lie said.

“Anyone who comprehends the third sword scar can be the personal disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi. But, apparently, it’s not that easy to be his personal disciple with his strength. As far as I know, he still does not have a personal disciple in the Ancient Sect.”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

In the Ancient Sect, there were so many disciples, most of who were geniuses of Sword Principle, but no one among them could meet the requirement set by Palace Master Xuan Yi and comprehend the three sword scars. This obviously demonstrated how difficult it was to comprehend the three sword scars.

“Senior Brother. Other than Sword Tower, there is one more Sword Pavilion in Sword Palace, where plenty of Sword Principle experts have left behind their experiences. Some of the experts even created Secret Skills related to Sword Principle. You can go and have a look. Besides, I heard that there is also a Sword Mountain in Sword Palace, but it’s just hearsay as I’ve never been there,” Zhu Lie said.

“I see. Thank you so much,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“You’re welcome, Senior Brother. I’m off now, if you don’t mind,” Zhu Lie said.

“Right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Once Zhu Lie left, Jian Wushuang sat down in front of the dark stone tablet.

“Various Sword Principle geniuses have been stuck on these three sword scars from Palace Master Xuan Yi. Let me see how unique they are!” With some expectations, Jian Wushuang began carefully meditating on the three sword scars.

Jian Wushuang started by looking over the first of the three sword scars, the one which Zhu Lie had comprehended.

Even if the first sword scar was the most common one, Jian Wushuang still felt it was obscure.

Jian Wushuang mediated on it carefully after calming himself down. A moment later, he discovered something.

“This sword scar...” Jian Wushuang continued staring at the sword scar as his expression became increasingly grim.

“Clearly it’s just a sword scar, but it contains nine different Sword Essences. If these nine Sword Essences are separated, you’ll get nine different sword movements!”

It immediately reminded Jian Wushuang of the nine sword moves that Zhu Lie had performed in front of Vice Palace Master Nie.

Zhu Lie had fully comprehended the first sword scar, which meant he had fully grasped the nine sword movements included in the sword scar and performed them.

It was easy to say, but each of the nine sword movements was so intriguing that people had to spend a very long time exploring them. It as no wonder that Zhu Lie spent dozen of years to comprehend the nine sword movements.

“As there are nine different sword movements, even I would spend a long time if I meditated on them one by one.”?Jian Wushuang said silently.

At this point, Jian Wushuang looked over the second and third sword scar.

Jian Wushuang frowned as he gazed at them.

“The second and third sword scar look exactly the same as the first sword scar!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart sank.
