Chapter 1534: Zi Dongwang Who Prided Himself

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the third level of the cave, Zi Dongwang’s speed of resolving the Scattered Stars Game was extremely fast.

“The fifth hundredth move!”

There was a sharp light glistening in Zi Dongwang’s eyes. On the chessboard before him, half of the one thousand black chess pieces had disappeared.

Then, Zi Dongwang glanced at everyone around him, especially those on Universe God ranking list.

He realized that God Destroying King, who was on the first place on Universe God ranking list, was only resolving four hundred and fiftieth move.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were resolving the four-hundred-and-forty-first move and the four-hundred-and-forty-seventh move.

The few others were roughly on similar moves.

“Haha, they have yet to even solve the four-hundred-and-fiftieth move. Too slow, too slow!”

“God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang, aren’t the three of you at a higher ranking than I am? the three of you are just so!”

“Faster and faster with every step!”

“I already solved the five hundredth move. According to this speed, in the one hundred time frame, I shall solve six hundred moves or even seven hundred moves. These people will fall far behind me!”

“The White Blaze Fruit Tree for the first test is mine. No one can fight against me!”

Zi Dongwang was smug with success and he felt every inch a hero.

Very soon, he continued to solve.

He didn’t know that in the crowd around him, some of the top geniuses behind him were looking at him in ridicule.

In the lofty hall in the outside world.

“Zi Dongwang has already solved the five hundredth move. It has only been twelve years. Hehe, he is really quite fast!”

Among the Almighties, the unicorn red-haired elderly sneered.

The other Almighties around him were ridiculing Zi Dongwang too.

“This Zi Dongwang, I thought highly of him previously. Even though he lost to Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang, he was still considered an impressive genius. But from what it seems now, he is just an idiot! He thought to solve the Scattered Stars Game with only speed?”

A coldly elegant woman spoke. The coldly elegant woman was also an Almighty.

“Humph, his speed is really fast, far beyond the others. However, he didn’t accumulate any experience. This is just like a cultivator who took an elixir to forcefully increase his power and realm. Although the speed at the beginning is really fast, his potential was cut off entirely. I am certain that Zi Dongwang definitely can’t solve the five hundred and fiftieth level!”

Hearing the coldly elegant woman’s remark, the Almighties exchanged a look and laughed.

Obviously, they agreed with what the former had said.

“Actually, he can’t be blamed. Zi Dongwang was a solo expert after all. There wasn’t any expert behind him to give him pointers, nor tell him about techniques to solve the Scattered Stars Game. Naturally, he thought it was best to solve it quickly,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain said with a smile.

“Humph, among the top ten geniuses on Universe God ranking list, Duan Lingfeng and Seven Universe King have no backer and they are solo experts too. Why did they know to slowly solve it and accumulate experience but Zi Dongwang didn’t? It’s because he was arrogant and got himself too many enemies. They knew that he took a wrong approach but no one was willing to remind him.”

“Plus, even if there was no one who reminded him, he should be able to tell easily. What about God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang, whose comprehension levels are not on the same level, if not better than his? Why would the resolving speed of the three of them be faster than him? Why didn’t he think about it?”

“Idiot. He’s an idiot,” the coldly elegant lady humphed.

True. If Zi Dongwang were to be a kinder person and have made some good friends, the others would remind him that he was on a wrong path.

Just like Duan Lingfeng. He didn’t know anything about Scattered Stars Game, but Jian Wushuang had reminded him right at the beginning to proceed steadily and not rush through it.

In the end, Zi Dongwang’s human relationship was too bad.

Every genius at the scene was watching him like he was a joke. Who was willing to remind him?

They let him take the wrong route.

Zi Dongwang thought highly of himself. He saw that Jian Wushuang and the rest fell far behind him and he thought their comprehension level was not high as his.

He was a total joke.

In the cave, the Universe Gods were trying their best to solve the Scattered Stars Game.

Zi Dongwang’s speed continued.

In the blink of an eye, thirty years flew past.

“Phew!”

Zi Dongwang let out a breath of relief and slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the chessboard before him that the five hundred and twenty-one black chess pieces disappeared.

“The five-hundred-and-twenty-first move is so meticulous. It trapped me for three years,” Zi Dongwang frowned.

He who desired to lead by a wide margin was stuck at that one move for three years. It naturally led him to dissatisfaction.

But then, he glanced at his surroundings and wanted to see how the others were doing.

Then, his pupils shrunk at the sight.

“God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang, including Xin Zhu and the others, they have already solved the five-hundredth move. God Destroying King and Seven Universe King solved the five-hundred-and-eleventh move. They were merely ten moves away from me?”

“How did their speeds pick up so quickly so suddenly?”

“It seems that I have to speed up and quickly solve six hundred moves to leave them far behind!”

Zi Dongwang felt a sudden pressure.

He immediately started to solve the five hundred and twenty-second move.

But he didn’t know that it wasn’t that Jian Wushuang, God Destroying King or any one of them had become faster, but that he had become slower.

On the five-hundred-and-twenty-first move, he was troubled for three years. But Jian Wushuang and the others?

Until then, they have yet to reach any bottleneck.

The time continued to fly past.

After fifty years, Zi Dongwang remained at the five-hundred-and-fortieth move, but God Destroying King and Seven Universe King caught up to him successively. They reached the five-hundred-and-fortieth?move.

“They caught up?”

“No, no. How can I let you catch up with me?!”

“Solve, hurry up and solve.”

Zi Dongwang immediately panicked.

But, no matter how anxious he was, he couldn’t solve the move.

In a few months’ time, God Destroying King and Seven Universe King solved the move and stepped foot on the five hundred and forty-first move.

Zi Dongwang, who had been leading by wide margin previously, was finally overtaken.

Not long after God Destroying King and Seven Universe King overtook him, Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang, Xin Zhu, Universe God Liu Ying, Demon King Ice Feather and all the other geniuses in the top ten on Universe God ranking list also overtook him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Then, even those in the top twenty and the top thirty on Universe God ranking list were above him too.

Zi Dongwang was dumbfounded by the situation.

“How could it turn out like this?”
