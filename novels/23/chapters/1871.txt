Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Hong!

A fierce blowing sound was heard and the void instantly exploded.

The moment they saw Jian Wushuang take action, Emperor Sword Sect, a total of seven Almighties including Emperor Sword Sect Master, looked shocked.

Although they were seven Almighties, they were dealing with a true decision then.

“Reincarnation Palm!”

Jian Wushuang’s billowing divine power concentrated in collaboration with the power of ancient tribe bloodline, under the cover of reincarnation power.

Vroom. A huge palm that seemed to contain the entire Reincarnation Doctrine swept out.

The moment the palm was pushed out, the universe changed its color.

The palm engulfed the seven people, including Emperor Sword Sect Master.

Jian Wushuang was obviously going to fight the seven alone!

“You have guts!”

Emperor Sword Sect Master immediately roared. As his voice reverberated in the sky, a boundless sword intention soared up from his body.

Although Emperor Sword Sect Master was stupid, he was quite powerful. He was a true Peak Emperor God after all.

Then, there was a spear with a green luster that gave out faint gold lightning in his hands. His might instantly increased. “Break!” As Emperor Sword Sect Master spat one word, the spear instantly brought about boundless golden lightning and stabbed. It pierced the reincarnation palm.

Hualala. Boundless divine power dispersed to the surrounding and Emperor Sword Sect Master’s figure shuttled through the reincarnation palm. His gaze was cold as he glared at Jian Wushuang, “Sword Formation!”

The six Almighties from Emperor Sword Sect quickly exploded their soaring sword intentions when they heard Emperor Sword Sect Master’s command.

The six Almighties’ sword intentions resonated and instantly formed a huge sword formation.

Emperor Sword Sect focused on swords and their sword formation was extremely famous too.

Then, what the six Almighties had performed was Six Sword Formation. It was the strongest sword formation that combined both attacks and defense as one. The sword formation performed by six Sir Gods altogether was even more powerful.

“Die!”

The moment the sword formation took place, the six Almighties glared coldly and suddenly drove the formation at Jian Wushuang.

Similarly, Six Sword Formation attacked too.

Jian Wushuang looked at everything in front of him calmly. On the finger on his right hand, there was billowing divine power gathering. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Ancient God’s Seventh Finger, Vault of Heaven’s Finger!”

Hong!!

A terrifying spacetime whirlpool that covered hundreds of thousands of miles appeared in the air. The whirlpool strangled everything in the universe to death. For instance, the palaces in Emperor Sword Sect shattered into pieces. Luckily, the Real Gods and Universe Gods from Emperor Sword Sect retreated to a faraway place so that they weren’t affected.

Otherwise, the spacetime whirlpool itself would be sufficient to turn Emperor Sword Sect into bloodbath.

Then, there was a huge finger in a black jade color that extended from the whirlpool. The huge finger was boundless and it pointed to the void in front with terrifying power.

“Six Sword Matches, Life Destroying Sword Out!”

Among the six Almighties from Emperor Sword Sect, one of them shouted and the six terrifying sword intentions merged. Rumble. A huge sword that gave out a boundless gleam substantiated and the huge sword swung down under the trigger of the formation.

Bang!

Both collided and the void suddenly became quiet.

In a short while, both the huge black and jade colored finger and the huge sword that gave out a boundless gleam collapsed.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked shocked.

He utilized his divine power and ancient tribe bloodline to perform Ancient God’s Seventh Finger, Vault of Heaven’s Finger.

In the end, the six Almighties had withstood it with their sword formation?

“That’s interesting,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Die!”

A sharp sword intention that seemed to be able to tear everything suddenly exploded from Jian Wushuang. Emperor Sword Sect Master appeared next to Jian Wushuang and wielded his spear with faint lightning.

Sword light attacked and brought about the surrounding spacetime and sword intention that signified that it stops at nothing until it killed its enemy.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. Blood Mountain Sword was drawn from the scabbard and wielded his sword.

Dang!

There was a low clashing noise. Emperor Sword Sect Master was a Peak Emperor God after all. Although his ranking wasn’t as high as Fortress Master Hong Tian’s on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, who had died, he wasn’t weak. Jian Wushuang was in a hurry to withstand the sudden stroke and he inevitably took a few steps back.

Emperor Sword Sect Master saw that and he gained confidence. “Jian Wushuang, you’re courting death yourself. You dare to attack in Emperor Sword Sect? Even if I kill you here today, there is definitely no one who will comment much.”

“Kill me here? Emperor Sword Sect Master, you have some guts,” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but sneer.

The surrounding Almighties who were watching the fight turned up their noises at what Emperor Sword Sect Master had said.

Jian Wushuang was on the twenty-second place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

As such a superb existence, only Great Emperors or the top among Emperor Gods, Underworld Gods, would be confident in winning against Jian Wushuang.

Emperor Sword Sect Master was merely at the bottom of all Peak Emperor Gods but he wanted to kill Jian Wushuang.

Even if he was in Emperor Sword Sect and he had the assistance of the other six Almighties, they could at most fight evenly with Jian Wushuang.

Kill Jian Wushuang… The people at the scene wanted to ask Emperor Sword Sect Master where his courage came from.

“Emperor Sword Sect is pitiful to have you as their sect master,”Jian Wushuang sneered and there was faint chilly gleam in his eyes.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

Three golden lights suddenly soared up.

The three golden lights were glorious like three golden suns. They were Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Swords.

“Golden swords?”

“It’s Sword Emperor’s famous golden swords!”

“The moment the golden swords are out, it means that Sword Emperor is going all-out.”

The surrounding experts who were watching gasped as they held their breath and watched.

Jian Wushuang didn’t speak anymore but the three Hong Jun Golden Swords quivered and instantly shot out.

The three golden lights flashed past like fish in a pond.

The three golden lights bypassed Emperor Sword Sect Master and instantly appeared in front of the six Almighties.

The six Almighties immediately responded.

“Be careful!”

“Activate the formation to block the three golden swords!”

Vroom. A fierce sword intention exploded and the six Almighties followed his command.

Jian Wushuang saw and smiled in disdain. “Did it work?”

Dang! Dang! Dang!

Three continuous thuds and the three Hong Jung Golden Swords backed off and instantly plunged out again.

The second attack!
