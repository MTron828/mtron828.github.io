Yin Long could not believe it.

Jian Wushuang had already turned around. “Senior Brother Yin Long, please pick up your battle blade, and let’s try again.”

“Very well.” Yin Long did not hesitate and picked up his weapon as he looked over at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Yin Long had a heavy expression on his face.

“Ready?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyes and looked at Yin Long.

“Yup.” Yin Long nodded.

However, just as he was nodding, Jian Wushuang made his move again.

Woosh! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He could vaguely see a ghastly silhouette sweeping by before the same scenario happened again.

The wound on Yin Long’s arm had deepened while his battle blade fell to the ground once again.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, this is already the second time. Shall we try once more?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Again.” Yin Long did not give up and crossed hands with Jian Wushuang again, but the result was the same.

This went on for another five more rounds where they crossed blades seven consecutive times and yet, Yin Long could not even touch the corner of Jian Wushuang’s robe before being defeated.

Moreover, Yin Long could not even find a chance to make one move.

The battle blade in his hand had not even been swung once.

“How did that happen?”

Impossible, it’s impossible!”

He is obviously at the Early Stage Chaotic Realm, the power he projects is definitely much weaker than mine as well. However, when we crossed hands... I didn’t even have the time to react!”

Yin Long’s eyes looked hollow while the corner of his mouth kept mumbling to himself.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, have you understood it?” Jian Wushuang looked at Yin Long once again.

Yin Long paused and started thinking.

Jian Wushuang continued. “The level of a practitioner isn’t always determined by his realm stage. I admit, it does play an important role—in normal circumstances, your Middle Stage Chaotic Realm can definitely crush my Early Stage. However, in unusual circumstances, the Early Stage Chaotic Realm could still easily defeat the Middle Stage, even killing it!”

Like now, I could easily defeat you despite me truly only using the power of Early Stage energy, including its speed. However, my understanding of sword skills, technique, and sense of law insights are miles ahead of yours. It was because of that, I could easily kill you!”

Regarding Qian Xia that you saw today... It’s definitely true that he has broken into the peak level of Chaotic Realm and his ability has become a lot stronger than before, but that doesn’t mean you wouldn’t stand a chance. After all, Qian Xia only broke through with the help of the Long Yang Fruit’s efficacy. A person who broke through with such a method is the most unstable one, ability-wise.”

Besides, you are hardworking enough. Your understanding of the blade and techniques is a lot higher than Qian Xia, plus you have a lot more fighting experience than he does. In such a situation, even if Qian Xia is a realm higher than you, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a good fight and a very good winning chance. I dare say, the chance of him winning over you is 70% to 30%. 70% for him and 30% for you!”

“30% is not a low chance. If you could seize the opportunity, it isn’t impossible to defeat Qian Xia.”

Listening to Jian Wushuang’s words, Yin Long who felt immense pressure and even a little depressed, had his eyes lit up.

If Jian Wushuang had told him something similar before, he would probably pay no mind to it. However, Jian Wushuang had demonstrated how he could’ve defeated him completely with just the level of an Early Stage Chaotic Realm.

If Jian Wushuang could defeat him at that level, why could he not defeat Qian Xia with his Middle Stage Chaotic Realm?

The important part was as Jian Wushuang had said, Qian Xia reached his level with the help of a natural treasure’s efficacy. His practical abilities were not very strong and his other aspects were mediocre as well. Facing such an opponent did not really mean that he had no winning chance at all.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, I’ll stop talking. It’s up to you after this.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and left.

Yin Long stared at Jian Wushuang for a long time until he had disappeared into the night before snapping out of his deep thoughts.

At that moment, he was filled with tremendous fighting motivation!

That was right, it was the motivation for battle!

Earlier, his heart turned cold when he saw Qian Xia’s breakthrough, thinking that he did not stand a chance and would have to wait for another three years.

But now, his motivation has been ignited again and was in fact burning even brighter and stronger.

At that moment, he only wanted to have a face down with Qian Xia and defeat him with his strongest abilities!

“Junior Brother Wushuang...”

Yin Long deeply looked at Jian Wushuang’s back and his eyes illuminated with amazement.

Soon after, Yin Long returned to his room and started regenerating his divine power.

As the sky just began faintly turning bright on the next day, the Outer Court of Narcissus Island started boiling in a frenzy.

The Selection continued on the fighting ring.

It was the last day of the Selection and the final victor shall stand a chance to become a core disciple on Narcissus Island.

In order to seize this one and only opportunity, the outer disciples fought with extreme intensity.

...

At the Outer Court, Jian Wushuang’s courtyard.

Jian Wushuang calmly sat at the stone table, as usual, studying the insights on the jade slips while sipping tea.

Without realizing how much time had passed, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the afar space. He could see a clear trace of redness.

The sun was setting.

“It’s sunset already? If nothing out of the ordinary happened, the Selection should be finished by now. I wonder what the final result is.” said Jian Wushuang to himself.

He really liked Yin Long. Naturally, he hoped that he would smoothly go through the Selection and become Narcissus Island’s core disciple.

Although he did not care about being a core disciple himself, it was of utmost importance for Yin Long.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang’s courtyard door opened and a few people came in.

Jian Wushuang spotted Yin Long leading in front.

At that moment, Yin Long’s depressed demeanor from the night before had been replaced by excitement and ecstasy.

“Looks like he had passed and became Narcissus Island’s core disciple. He didn’t waste my effort last night of giving him pointers,” said Jian Wushuang to himself.

Yin Long and the few others walked towards Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, congratulations.” Jian Wushuang stood up to greet him.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, you didn’t even attend the Selection. How did you know you should congratulate Senior Brother Yin Long?” asked an outer disciple directly.

“Can’t I tell from his facial expression?” Jian Wushuang casually smiled.

“That’s true.” The outer disciple laughed.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, I’m here to express my gratitude,” said Yin Long respectfully.
