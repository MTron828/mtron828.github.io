Chapter 2101 The Holy Objec

As the three clans entered, the massacre commenced.

The Sky Swallowing Clan was left with less than one-tenth of their experts, with no Great Emperor. They could not resist.

Before long, the entire Sky Swallowing Clan was wiped clean. Countless Sky Swallowers were slaughtered.

The three clans then began their search for the people that had managed to escape.

“My Sky Swallowing Clan, no more!”

Ba Su stood in the Void, his face darkening like an angry lion.

“Jian Wushuang! Jian Wushuang!”

Ba Su started screaming in a frenzy, his voice so loud that everyone around could feel the anger and hatred coming from it.

“No need to grieve, Clan Leader Ba Su. Even though the Sky Swallowers’ foundation was destroyed today, many of your experts survived. If you are willing to join Three Emperors World, your clan will certainly prosper again. This revenge, you will have it, if you’re willing to do what it takes,” the black-robed elder said.

“Hmm?” Ba Su immediately looked at him. “I’m going to kill Jian Wushuang with my own two hands, and destroy the Ancient God Clan.”

“Of course you can. From what I know, an opportunity of a lifetime lies within the Three Emperors World. If you give me your allegiance, the Demon King will allow you to seek that opportunity. If you work hard enough, you may even learn a bit of the Rules of Order, becoming a Third Stage Great Emperor like the Demon King!”

“If you make it there, what’s killing Jian Wushuang?” the elder laughed.

“Third Stage?” Ba Su’s eyes brightened up. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

During the First Era, there had only been three stages among Great Emperors.

Even though there were a lot of Great Emperors in that era, only a few made it to the Third Stage, the pinnacle of a Great Emperor. Ba Su had always wanted to become a Third Stage Great Emperor himself.

“If I can reach the Third Stage, so what if I join the Three Emperors World?” Ba Su said directly.

“Haha, this is wonderful news,” the elder cheered.

To one side, that person from the Holocaust Sect overheard this conversation. She covered her sneering well.

She knew the elder was not lying to Ba Su. Within the Three Emperors World lay a land of opportunity to learn a bit of the Rules of Order.

But that opportunity was so slim.

After all, the Rules of Order were not for everyone.

During the First Era, there were so many Great Emperors. Why were there not more than ten Third Stage Emperors?

The Rules of Order were too hard.

With Ba Su’s abilities, the chances of him actually learning the Rules of Order were close to zero, unless he got lucky.

The elder knew this too, he just chose not to disclose it.

“Ah, right.”

Ba Su’s expression changed. “Now that my clan has been wiped out and my lair taken over, they will have discovered my clan’s Holy Object.”

“Holy Object?” the elder looked towards Ba Su. “What Holy Object?”

“It is a treasure left from the first leader of the clan, from the First Era,” Ba Su said.

“Treasure left from the first Sky Swallowing Clan leader?” the elder was shaken. “Is it that treasure?”

“Yes,” Ba Su nodded solemnly.

“Damn it, that treasure is not like any other. It’s usage can be amplified when used in battle by a suitable expert. If the treasure lands in the hands of either the Special Tribe Alliance or the human Sanctuary Alliance … it will pose a threat to us. Ba Su, why did you not mention this beforehand?”

From his gaze, one could tell that the treasure was special.

“Relax, even though now Jian Wushuang has it, no one can really control it. This Holy Object has been in my hands for so many years, so many years have I tried to control it. But it never happened. What more of an outsider?” Ba Su replied confidently.

“Leader Ba Su, this does not mean others are not able to control it. Don’t forget Jian Wushuang is gifted beyond our understanding, recognised by basically the entire Eternal Chaotic World.”

“So what if he’s a genius?” Ba Su sneered. “That treasure is different. In order to use it, one would have to master nine different skills, then perfectly combine all of them. Only then would the treasure be activated. Those nine skills are all too complex to understand!”

“When the first leader received that treasure at an Ancient battlefield, he took eight hundred thousand years to understand and master all nine skills! Our clan’s first leader was the top few experts of his era, and even he took eight hundred years! Even if Jian Wushuang is stronger than him, for him to learn all nine skills would take him at least a couple thousand years, don’t you think?”

“Tens of thousands of years, understanding it without break. You think Jian Wushuang has time for that? By the time he has mastered all nine skills, the human Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance will have vanished, the Eternal Chaotic World long in the Three Emperors World’s hands.”

Only after hearing this did the elder heave a sigh of relief.

He had heard about the capabilities of the First Era’s Sky Swallowing Clan leader. During that time, the number of people that could go against him was not more than ten. If he needed eight hundred thousand years, Jian Wushuang could not do it in any less.

The Three Emperors World was already gearing up for battle with the Eternal Chaotic World, and its results would most likely come out within a few millenia. Jian Wushuang could not possibly find the time to master it.
