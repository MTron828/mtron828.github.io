Chapter 2604: The First Four Stages

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ladies and gentlemen, that’s an accurate guess. If this Transmigration Sword Formation is really that valuable, it won’t be presented in this auction. However, this sword formation truly originated from Sword Lord Tong Xin.” The Golden Chief’s huge voice resonated in the auction house.

“The reason it appears in this auction is due to its incompleteness!

“Sword Lord Tong Xin was extraordinarily talented. After he created the Transmigration Sword Formation, he gradually perfected it. It kept improving following the continuous progress in his understanding of Transmigration Law and sword principles. The Transmigration Sword Formation started with only one stage, but ended with a total of twelve stages!

“In other words, the Transmigration Sword Formation has a total of sword formation twelve stages and are separated into the first four, middle four, and final four stages. Among them, the first four stages were extremely powerful but also widely circulated. The middle stages are overpowering but there were fewer of them being circulated. As for the final four stages, they are the real assets that Sword Lord Tong Xin relied on to roam the Ancient God Domain!

“The sword formation’s final four stages alone were enough to cause a crazy competition among Undying Saints to obtain them. The middle four stages were also drooled over by countless Heavenly Ultimate Gods, Grand Ultimate Gods, and Undying Saints. However, what we have here today are only the first four stages of the Transmigration Sword Formation!

“These four stages of the sword formation are the most widely circulated, hence its value is a lot less ridiculous compared to the remaining stages.”

The many experts in the auction finally understood the situation upon hearing the Golden Chief’s explanation.

“So it’s only the first four stages. No wonder it appears in this auction.”

“According to the Golden Chief, Sword Lord Tong Xin’s Transmigration Sword Formation is absolutely terrifying but only the middle four and final four stages are the terrifying ones. As for these first four stages, they don’t seem as powerful.”

“Even so, they’re created by Sword Lord Tong Xin after all. Even if it’s the first four stages, I’m afraid it’s still out of the ordinary.”

“Unfortunately, although I’m skilled in sword principles, I’ve never studied Transmigration Law. Otherwise, I will try to purchase this sword formation.”

Many experts began to quietly discuss among themselves.

On the display stage, the Golden Chief spoke once again, “Honorable guests, I’ve been very clear with my explanation. I’ll leave it up to you in deciding on the value of these Transmigration Sword Formation’s first four stages. We will now begin the auction with the starting bid of ten million Primordial Stones!!”

“Ten million?”

There was a wave of exclamation in the venue, but it died down rather quickly.

Even though it was just the Transmigration Sword Formation’s first four stages, its value was still extraordinary.

There were people immediately making their bids. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the individual room on the second floor, Jian Wushuang stood there with his eyes staring firmly at the jade slip on the display shelf.

“Transmigration Sword Formation... The main criteria being skilled in sword principles and the secondary criteria are proficiency in Transmigration Law!

“This Transmigration Sword Formation turns out to be very fitting to me since I’m highly skilled in sword principles and also studied Transmigration Law.”

Jian Wushuang squinted.

He was no stranger to sword formations.

In his past life, he had more than one encounter with sword formations, so he understood its power.

Hongjun Golden Sword Technique for example was similar to a sword formation. In his past life, it was one of his main techniques. He would usually activate the Hongjun Golden Sword to suppress his opponent while fighting his opponent in close-range combat. It gave his opponents extreme pressure when both were combined.

The Transmigration Sword Formation was the almost invincible Sword Lord Tong Xin’s creation which at the Undying Saint realm with its power naturally not to be underestimated. If he could obtain such a sword formation, it would perhaps be a great help to him.

“I’m concurrently studying both Space-time and Transmigration Laws. However, I can’t simply utilize both laws simultaneously when I’m fighting experts. I could either activate Space-time Law and use Space-time Sword Technique, or activate Transmigration Law and use Transmigration Sword Technique. I could only activate one after another, but I can’t perfectly join them together.

“But if I can handle this sword formation...then, I can use Transmigration Law to drive the sword formation against my opponent while activating Space-time Law to fight him head-to-head. The power of both laws will then fuse perfectly and be unleashed simultaneously. Furthermore, the sword formation is for range attacks and my sword technique is for melee combat. Both can then come together perfectly!

“Furthermore, I’ll be able to take a brief rest from advancing Transmigration Sword skills and pour all my efforts into improving the Space-time Sword skills with this sword formation. I won’t need to use the Transmigration Sword Formation anymore once I’ve deepened my Sword Principle understanding and at that time I’ll just resume advancing my Transmigration Sword skills!”

Jian Wushuang held his hands together tightly as his eyes shone with excitement.

He repeatedly contemplated and consistently felt the Transmigration Sword Formation was very befitting for him. Although it would not immensely help to upgrade his overall battle strength, it could help to perfect his attack methods—making them more harmonious. That was a great advantage.

“Let’s do it!”

Jian Wushuang made his decision.

“Twenty million Primordial Stones!”

Jian Wushuang projected his voice from the room which resonated throughout the entire auction house.

As soon as the bid was made, the auction house became quiet for a short while. After that, a hoarse voice spoke from another room on the second floor, “Twenty-five million Primordial Stones. I’ll be taking this sword formation.”

“Thirty million.” Jian Wushuang did not hesitate to make his bid.

A short dark hunching old man frowned in the individual room the hoarse voice came from. He looked over at Jian Wushuang’s room with a cold light shining through his eyes.

Unfortunately, although he knew which room the voice came from, he would not know who was in the room.

“Twenty-five million Primordial Stones. Chan Tuo, hopes you can save me some face,” said the ugly old man once again.

“Chan Tuo? It’s him!”

“So, it’s that old toad! No wonder he’s interested in the Transmigration Sword Formation, but I’m curious about his competitor’s identity.”

“That old toad is a Peak Earth Ultimate God and has countless techniques. Not one to be trifled with!”

Many Earth Ultimate Gods in the second-floor rooms were secretly exclaiming.

All of them had heard of Chan Tuo’s reputation. He was very strong in both abilities and techniques and at the same time was an eccentric lone wolf.

However, it was exactly a lone wolf like him who only played by his own rule that was most terrifying.

At least, not many would dare cross him among the many Earth Ultimate Gods on the second-floor.

The reason he revealed his identity was to ask Jian Wushuang to give him some face.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang had no clue who Chan Tuo was and would not have cared even if he knew.

“Forty million Primordial Stones!” Jian Wushuang had spoken once again
