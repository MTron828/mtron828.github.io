Chapter 162: Half Step Yin-Yang Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It seemed like the same spear move, but when the spear clashed with the Triple-kill Sword, Jian Wushuang sensed a tremendous power pass through his hand, instantly numbing his arm, and forcing him to quickly retreat.

Jian Wushuang hit the trees behind him again. But this time, he didn’t stop until he had smashed three giant trees.

Jian Wushuang’s forehead knotted as he frowned, and the blood in his body was slightly turbulent.

“His strength suddenly increased so much?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Ouyang Haotian again, noticing a dramatic change in his spiritual power.

“His aura...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes froze.

He could feel that the aura given radiating from Ouyang Haotian was far beyond the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, but still slightly below the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

It seemed like something between the Gold Core Realm and the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

“Half Step Yin-Yang Realm!”?Jian Wushuang understood immediately.

The realm between the Gold Core Realm and the Yin-Yang Void Realm was the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm.

It resulted when a Gold Core Realm warrior forcibly repressed his realm when it was breaking through to the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

But under normal circumstances, no one would choose to do so. After all, a Gold Core Realm warrior would naturally strive to break through. Who would repress his own realm instead of ascending to the next level?

Therefore, the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm was rarely seen in the Tianzong Dynasty.

Ouyang Haotian was obviously in the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm.

“Hmm, you noticed?” Ouyang Haotian sneered while looking at Jian Wushuang, then said, “If it wasn’t for the Easternmost Hunt happening so soon, I would have have been in the Yin-Yang Void Realm half a year ago. But I suppressed my realm so I could join the hunt.”

“Jian Wushuang, you do not understand the pain of suppressing your cultivation when you are able to break through to a higher level, do you?”

“I sacrificed so much, just to perform better in the Easternmost Hunt. And you will be my first stepping-stone. After killing you, my next goal will be Xue Yun.”

Ouyang Haotian’s voice rang out coldly as he was slowly walking toward Jian Wushuang.

Up in the air, those top experts were also in a tumult.

“Half Step Yin-Yang Realm?”

“Is it the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm?”

“This little guy from the Ouyang clan is amazing.”

These experts were quite shocked.

The Half Step Yin-Yang Realm, although not a complete Yin-Yang Void Realm, was much stronger than the Gold Core Realm.

“Brother Ouyang, this time the Ouyang clan has trained an extraordinary little guy, congratulations!”

“With a cultivation at the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm and the combined Earth and Waterdrop Essences, Xue Yun may be the only one with enough strength to overshadow him amount the Gold Core Realm warriors in this selection battle.”

“There should be a place for this little guy in the 15 geniuses from this selection battle. He should also perform very well at the Easternmost Hunt. He might even be picked up by those old sects. If so, the entire Ouyang clan would gain great benefits.”

All these experts were complimenting him.

The person receiving their compliments was a white-haired old man, the present Master of the Ouyang clan, who was smiling from ear to ear while listening to their flattery.

If a great genius from a clan joined an old sect, the whole clan would gain huge influence.

The core disciples of those old sects will even be sought after by small empires like the Tianzong Dynasty.

On top of the giant mountain, Jian Wushuang was still struggling in his fight against Ouyang Haotian.

Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop!

Streaks of spear shadows thrust coldly toward Jian Wushuang, each shadow piercing the air with immense power. Jian Wushuang could only fend off these spears by using the Reincarnation Sword Skill to the limit of his ability, but the gap between their strengths was slowly exhausting him.

“My cultivation, which is in the Profound Gold Core Realm, is only on par with the Exceptional Gold Core Realm because my Supreme Gold Core can enhance my power by a hundredfold, but it still can’t compare with the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head.

His current level of cultivation was not strong enough.

If he could reach the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, with the support of his Supreme Gold Core, he could match a normal Yin-Yang Void Realm, which was stronger than Ouyang Haotian.

But for now, he was still weaker than Ouyang Haotian because he was in the Profound Gold Core Realm.

“Since I can’t defeat him with strength, I’ll have to depend on my comprehension.”?A billowing battle intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

In seven days there would be a life and death battle between Xue Yun and him, and Xue Yun was far stronger than Ouyang Haotian.

If he could not defeat Ouyang Haotian, then fighting Xue Yun would be the same as putting his head on the chopping block.

“Haha, go to hell.”

Ouyang Haotian laughed as the spear in his hand began to change its movements.

The spear sometimes slashed out, swung up, pounded down, and thrust forward with a cold light from time to time.

The spear moves, perfectly combining?the Earth and Waterdrop Essences, was incredibly powerful.

“Hum?”

As he struggled to fend off the attacks, Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed. Then he stared at the movements Ouyang Haotian displayed, and his eyes flashed as he sensed the realm embedded in the spear moves.

“This spear move...”

“Waterdrop Essence! Waterdrop Essence can be used this way?”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had an epiphany.

In the two-years he meditated in the Sword Tomb, it took him only one year and three months to combine the Gale and Raging Fire Sword Essences. He spent the remaining time trying to combine a third sword essence.

He had experienced some enlightenment during the following months.

But, regardless of whether it was the Earth Sword Essence or the Waterdrop Sword Essence, He was missing something crucial that prevented him from combining either of them with the Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire.

It was indeed the little things that he missed that troubled him for a long time.

But now, seeing the endless Waterdrop Essence that was bursting from Ouyang Haotian’s spear moves, Jian Wushuang was inspired, and the thing he was missing gradually became clear.

Boom!

The long pitch-dark spear struck out like a majestic mountain, which Jian Wushuang barely managed to ward off with his sword. A loud bang rang out as the power exploded, and then Jian Wushuang’s entire body sank down into the ground.

“Prepare to die, you little brat!” Ouyang Haotian laughed and then pierced forward with his spear, directly toward Jian Wushuang’s heart.

But, Jian Wushuang suddenly hacked out with his sword, making Ouyang Haotian immediately withdraw.

“What?” Ouyang Haotian looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had already struggled out from where he had sunk into the ground and lifted his head. A touch of a weird smile emerged on his cold face.

“I have to thank you, Ouyang Haotian!”

“If it were not for you, I would not have broken through so quickly.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled. At that moment, the Triple-kill Sword in his hand had... The Sword Essences of Gale, Raging Fire, and Waterdrop perfectly combined together!
