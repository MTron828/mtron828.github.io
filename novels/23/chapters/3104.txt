Chapter 3105: Holy Feather Sect

______________

“Yuan Chong.”

Sixth Prince frowned and glanced at Yuan Chong. “Follow Qing. If anything happens to Qing, you don’t have to come back.”

“Yes, Your Highness.” Yuan Chong nodded respectfully.

“Let’s go,” Qing said.

“Everyone, let’s go.” Yuan Chong looked at Jian Wushuang and the others.

Soon, Prince Qing, Yuan Chong, and the ten rank three True Saints, including Jian Wushuang, left the mansion and headed toward the distant void.

On the way, Yuan Chong and Prince Qing exchanged messages.

“Prince Qing, you can choose some stronger people to escort you, such as the ten rank four True Saints or the Sixth Prince’s Purple Blood Camp,” Yuan Chong said.

“No.” Prince Qing shook his head. “Sixth Brother is at a critical moment right now, and he needs more experts to protect him. The Purple Blood Battalion is his strongest force, and I can not use this force. As for the other experts, I don’t need them either. If it weren’t for Sixth Brother forcing me, I wouldn’t even bring these ten third rank True Saints with me.”

“After all, if I leave more experts behind for him, his situation will be better.”

“But this way, your situation will be very dangerous.” Yuan Chong frowned.

“Don’t worry, it won’t happen.” Royal Highness Qing said indifferently, “We are going to the Holy Feather Sect. It’s not far from the Zhen Wu Country. Moreover, there are no particularly dangerous areas on the way. As long as our luck is not too bad, we won’t encounter any danger.”

“Under normal circumstances, there won’t be any danger. But what about the Third Prince?” Yuan Chong said, “If the Third Prince knows that you are going to the Holy Feather Sect, he will definitely send powerful warriors here immediately.”

Hearing these words, Prince Qing’s face also sank.

Indeed, on the way to the Holy Feather Sect this time, she did not need to experience any dangerous places. However, the biggest threat to her was still that Third Prince.

“No matter what, I am still his biological sister. He would not attack me. Moreover, even if he knew that he wanted to attack me, he would have to find me. There are so many ways to go from the Zhen Wu Country to the Holy Feather Sect. How could he find me so easily?” Prince Qing said.

Yuan Chong nodded slightly, but his heart was still heavy.

The ten rank three True Saints behind them, including Jian Wushuang, still did not know where they were going.

But since they had followed Prince Qing, they would follow him wherever he went.

The group of people moved at a very fast speed in the void. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

…

The True Martial Kingdom was also in a huge mansion. This mansion was the residence of the Third Prince.

In the Magnificent Palace, a cold-looking man wearing a luxurious golden robe was sitting on the throne.

Below him, there were dozens of experts standing respectfully.

Among these dozens of experts, most of them were rank four True Saints. There were even three rank five True Saints.

In terms of strength, the Third Prince’s strength was clearly much stronger than the Sixth Prince’s.

“Ah Qing left sixth?” The Third Prince tapped the armchair with his finger, and his calm voice echoed throughout the palace.

“Yes, she left two days ago. She only had Yuan Chong, a peak fourth rank True Saint, and ten third rank True Saints with her,” a black-robed elder said respectfully.

“She only brought so few people?” The Third Prince raised his eyebrows. “Do you know where she is going?”

“I don’t know. However, according to the direction she is going, she should be heading out of the country.” The old man dressed in black said.

The Third Prince waved his hand, and a huge star map appeared in the center of the palace.

“This is the territory near my True Martial Kingdom. Tell me, where is Qing now?” The Third Prince said.

“Your Highness, she is here.” The black-clothed old man pointed to a direction in the star map.

When he saw the location pointed by the black-clothed old man, the Third Prince’s pupils shrank. Then, a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. “Ha ha, my little sister is really good to Sixth Brother. We are both from the same father. If she treats me like this, how good would that be?”

“Your Highness, do you know where Your Highness Qing is going?” The old man in black looked over.

“From the direction she is going, she should be heading to the Holy Feather Sect. Not long ago, I received news that an elder of the Holy Feather Sect who had reached the peak of stage six had taken a liking to her when he passed by the Zhen Wu Country. He even wanted to take her as his personal disciple. Now, she is going to the Holy Feather Sect. As long as she passes the elder’s test, she will be able to become his disciple. At that time, with this relationship, Ah Qing can ask the Holy Feather Sect to step in and support Sixth Brother’s ascension.” The Third Prince said.

“Will the Holy Feather Sect make a move?” The old man in black frowned.

“Ordinary disciples won’t be weak, but a personal disciple of a peak level six elder will have a certain amount of power. Moreover, if it really doesn’t work, then as long as Sixth Brother compromises a little and agrees to let the Zhen Wu Country become the king under the Holy Feather Sect, then the Holy Feather Sect will naturally make a move.” The Third Prince laughed.

“If that’s the case…Your Highness, we must act quickly.” The black-clothed old man said anxiously.

“Yes, we must act, but there is no need to be too anxious. After all, it will take at least one or two months to arrive at the Holy Feather Sect from Sixth Brother. Such a long time is enough for us to prepare. God four, I will leave this matter to you. When you see Ah Qing, tell her that as her elder brother, I can give her a chance. As long as she comes back with you and stays by my side obediently from now on, I will naturally not make things difficult for her. When I become the king, she will still be the only princess in the Zhen Wu Kingdom.” The Third Prince said.

“But what if Prince Qing doesn’t agree?” The black-clothed elder asked.

“If he doesn’t agree…then I can only pretend that I don’t have a sister,” the Third Prince said coldly.

“Understood.” The black-clothed elder glanced at the Third Prince, then bowed and left.

…

In the vast void, Jian Wushuang and his group were flying rapidly.

It had been more than a month since they left the Sixth Prince’s mansion, and they had already left the territory of the True Martial Kingdom.

They did not encounter any danger or trouble along the way.

“According to our speed, we will arrive at the Holy Feather Sect in ten days at most.” Prince Qing’s expression was cold, but there was a trace of expectation in his heart.

But at this moment…

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang, who was in the crowd, suddenly raised his head. He could sense that there were dozens of powerful auras rapidly approaching from the void in front of him.

In just a moment, the dozens of experts had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others.

“Haha… Your Highness Qing, I have been waiting here for you for a long time.”

A hearty laughter suddenly echoed in the world.
