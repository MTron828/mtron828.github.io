Chapter 846: Emergency Meeting

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Sir, this is your armor.” A scarlet-robed elder handed a new set of Blood-eagle Armor to Jian Wushuang in his residence.

The scarlet-robed elder knew Jian Wushang from when he led him and Shura into the Blood Eagle Guard. He had also heard about him from his third special treatment.

At that time, the scarlet-robed elder had treated Jian Wushuang casually. However, now he became extremely respectful to the boy.

He had to. Jian Wushuang was now a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, second only to Commander Hong. So the scarlet-robed elder and the One-claw and Two-claw Blood Eagle Guards had to address him as “Sir”.

“Third-rank armor?”

Seeing this scarlet armor with a bloody eagle pattern, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Not only did the Blood-eagle Armor have a strong defensive capability, but it also greatly improved its owner’s offensive power.

When Jian Wushuang was still a One-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, his first-rank armor only improved his offensive power by about 20 percent. Then, when he was promoted to a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, his offensive power increased by 50 percent with the second-rank armor.

Now, he had become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, so he was qualified to own a set of third-rank armor.

Jian Wushuang quickly put on the armor. As he clenched his fists, the terrifying strength broke out.

This force was amplified by the armor’s restriction, and no less than doubled in an instant.

“Sure enough, it’s doubled.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with excitement.

Doubled?

It was not like the double effect of the Star-river Secret Skill.

The Star-river Secret Skill was a Power Amplification Secret Skill. If Jian Wushuang employed this skill, his strength would be improved but limited to his own level, the Divine Realm.

Therefore, even if Jian Wushuang had mastered Level 15 of Star-river Secret Skill and his offensive power was tripled, his overall strength would not have improved greatly.

However, this Blood-eagle Armor was able to help him enhance the power of all his skills, which meant that his overall strength doubled!

Amazing!

“My strength has also improved a lot over my 15 years in the Blood Eagle Guard. Now that I have this third-rank armor, my overall strength will be upgraded to a new level. Now I don’t have to be afraid of anyone I meet except Dao Masters,”?Jian Wushuang thought while clenching his fists.

The news Jian Wushuang had received a third-rank armor and became a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard soon spread throughout the lair. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jian Wushuang and Shura sat together by a table near the wall of the Eagle Hall, drinking and chatting.

Jian Wushuang’s frantic task-taking over the past 15 years was known to all.

Asura, who had joined the Blood Eagle Guard with Jian Wushuang, also performed well, but he was far inferior to him.

Asura had not gained enough points, so he was still a One-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, and there was still a certain way to go before he was a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard.

“Blood Mountain, have you heard of it? A few days ago, the commander personally ordered all the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards to come back, including those who were carrying out tasks,” Shura whispered.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “Yeah, I’ve heard of it.”

Commander Hong had urgently summoned Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards back, which caused an uproar throughout the entire lair, so naturally, Jian Wushuang had heard of it.

“Aside from you, there are 17 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards here who I have never met before. It’s said that most of them have been performing secret missions outside, and rarely returned to our lair. I wonder, why did the commander actually ask them back in such a hurry?” Shura sighed.

Jian Wushuang was also curious.

Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards were the experts at the Peak of Step Six, so each had incomparable strength.

Their tasks were certainly very important, but now, Commander Hong had made Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards leave their tasks and rush back, so it was definitely because of something extraordinary.

While Jian Wushuang was deep in thought, an ordinary Blood Eagle Guard walked inside and bowed to him respectfully, “Sir, the commander ordered you to meet him immediately.”

“The commander wants to meet me?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, drank up the wine, and then left.

The towering scarlet palace was entirely covered by a powerful restriction, so no one was able to break in without permission.

The handsome, indifferent man Commander Hong in a scarlet cloak sat majestically on the largest throne at the front of the palace. More than two meters tall, he looked down at the crowd of figures congregated in the middle of the hall.

Jian Wushuang was also standing among the crowd.

“These guys…”

Jian Wushuang looked around indifferently at the surrounding figures. Each one of these had a mighty aura, making him feel a lot of pressure. There were quite a few, exactly 17 in total.

“They must be the 17 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards? And with me, that makes 18.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

When he looked around, Jian Wushuang noticed that they glanced at him from time to time.

“Gentlemen. Most of you were undertaking tasks outside. After receiving my messages, you immediately came back. Thank you.”

After some courtesy words, Commander Hong continued, “Right, this is Blood Mountain. He joined us 15 years ago and is also a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. Let’s welcome him.”

The other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards immediately turned to look at Jian Wushuang, but did not say anything.

Jian Wushuang responded with a slight nod.

“Well, let’s get down to business. The reason I’m so anxious to call you back this time, is this…”

Commander Hong took out a scroll as he spoke.

This scroll had the same shape and size as a regular one. The only difference was the color.

The scroll was entirely scarlet as if it were dyed with blood.

“The scarlet task scroll?”

The 18 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards, including Jian Wushuang, were completely shocked.

The task scrolls released by the Eagle Hall had different colors representing different task levels.

For example, the Catastrophe Level task that Jian Wushuang had finished several days ago was printed on a jet black scroll.

The scarlet scroll meant the level of the task was…

Hell Level!
