Chapter 490: Enemies Arrive

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Marquis Nanyu died with his eyes wide opened. His body fell from the air.

The place was dead silent and the onlookers were stunned.

A super expert in the Divine Land, one of the 72 Marquises, Marquis Nanyu, was killed before their very eyes, and it was done by a Saint Realm expert!

“A Saint Realm expert killed a marquis with using his full power, and Marquis Nanyu couldn’t even run away.”

“Jian Wushuang is indeed powerful!”

“I never thought there would be such a horrifying Saint Realm expert in the Divine Land.”

“How could a Saint Realm expert be so strong?”

Everyone was completely shocked.

However, before they could calm down, another daunting force exploded from a different battlefield.

An enchanting sword shadow came into view and attracted everyone’s attention.

The attack was mysterious, and the power behind it reached its peak because of the Dao Weapon.

Jian Nantian, who launched the attack, looked indifferent, but there was still a hint of killing intent gathered in his eyes.

“Shit!”

Marquis Wanlei, Jian Nantian’s opponent, turned pale when he saw the attack, but he still tried to block it.

However, Jian Nantian’s sword still knocked his Giant Axe away and pierced straight through him.

Marquis Wanlei had been killed as well.

He died because he had underestimated Jian Nantian.

He didn’t know that before the “thousand sword salute” took place, Jian Nantian had already killed a superior lord and two advanced lords with a single blow. At that time, he was already as powerful as an ordinary marquis.

With a great opportunity like the”thousand sword salute”, it was only natural that Jian Nantian had progressed a lot.

Besides that, Jian Nantian had stepped into the Seven-cloud Realm, he possessed excellent swordsmanship, and he also had a Dao Weapon. Thus, he was definitely much more powerful than Marquis Wanlei.

In such a short amount of time, both Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu had been killed.

However, Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian did not appear to be proud.

They knew very well that the two marquises were just ordinary Seven-cloud Realm experts without any Dao Weapons. They regarded them as shrimps and had not taken them seriously from the very beginning. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The one behind the two was their real concern.

“He’s here.”

Jian Nantian’s dark eyes turned towards the sky, where a figure off in the distance was slowly becoming more and more clear.

Behind the figure was a large red cloud. A moment later, the figure finally arrived in front of Jian Nantian.

The figure wore a red robe and had red hair. He carried a blood-red saber on his back and turbulent red clouds following behind him. Standing there, he seemed like an Asura from the hell.

“Jian Nantian.”

The figure’s eyes were fixed on Jian Nantian with a barely suppressed killing intent in them.

“Marquis Xuefeng,” Jian Nantian replied calmly.

The figure, Marquis Xuefeng, was extremely powerful and had been chasing after Jian Nantian during these last few days. He even offered a Dao Weapon to anyone who could kill Jian Nantian.

Being ranked within the top 2 among the 72 marquises in the Divine Land demonstrated how powerful he was.

The dead Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu were marquises as well, but they were no match for Marquis Xuefeng.

Marquis Xuefeng appeared on the battlefield with a killing intent that was so overwhelming the onlookers could not help holding their breath.

The marquis looked down at Marquis Wanlei’s dead body.

“It seems that your power increased substantially during the meeting. You were even able to kill Wanlei,” Marquis Xuefeng said icily, “However, I still look down on you, and you will see how miserably the murderer of my sworn-brothers will end.”

“Really? Show me then.” Jian Nantian stared at Marquis Xuefeng calmly.

“You’re courting death!” Without wasting any more words, Marquis Xuefeng began to move forward and the turbulent red cloud that filled sky behind him moved forward as well.

Three Sword Soul Phantoms shot up behind Jian Nantian and rushed towards the Marquis while radiating an overwhelming Sword Essence.

“Marquis Xuefeng!”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes while watching the scene taking place in front of him.?“Marquis Xuefeng is in the Eight-cloud Realm and possesses a Dao Weapon. He is much more powerful than Wanlei. I hope father can deal with him.”

Jian Wushuang was lost in thought when a purple streak of flowing light suddenly emerged in front of him.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang looked toward the light and realized it was a man.

He was a burly man, clothed in purple. His grand aura revealed his identity as a marquis, one that was more powerful than Marquis Nanyu.

“He is... Marquis Zizhong!”

Someone recognized the man and called out his name in surprise.

Marquis Zizhong was a top marquis among the 72 Marquises in the Divine Land. He was also in the Eight-cloud Realm, and he even possessed a Dao Weapon, so he was just a little bit weaker than Marquis Xuefeng.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Marquis Zizhong looked toward Jian Wushuang as his frigid voice echoed, “Give me the Heart-killing Sword and I’ll spare your life.”

“Spare my life? Don’t talk like you can kill me! Marquis Zizhong, you don’t have the ability to take my life, so tell your boss to come out and do it himself,” Jian Wushuang said with a sneer.

Jian Wushuang knew very well that Marquis Zizhong was trying to seize the Heart-killing Sword under someone’s order.

There was no doubt that the person who gave him the order was Su Ming.

“No need to call anyone else. I can kill you on my own.”

Marquis Zizhong’s expression was ice cold as he gripped the cyan longspear in his hand, the head of which was sharp and gleamed with a metallic luster. Marquis Zizhong made a sudden move and the spear pierced through the air,?approaching Jian Wushuang.

“So fast!”

Jian Wushuang frowned, but his eyes were filled with battle intent.

“Good!”

“Since you want to fight, let’s fight!”
