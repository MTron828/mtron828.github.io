Chapter 1206: The Arrival

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

More than 20 Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace gathered in a splendid hall within the palace.

80 years!

During the 80-year preparation for war, the force of the Green Fire World had greatly improved, with the help of Nirvana Elixirs and God Soul Elixirs.

The greatest change was the increased number of high level experts.

Eighty years ago, there had been only six Palace Masters with the battle strength of a Universe Master, including Jian Wushuang, in the Green Fire Palace.

Now there were 21 Palace Masters in the Green Fire Palace.

They had also managed to foster 15 Universe Masters during the short 80 years.

At this moment, all of the Universe Masters, including Holy Master Yun, were looking at the scene at the center of the palace.

At the center of the palace, the Portal that had been there was still present, but the Spaceship moving through it had come considerably closer. Under the anxious gaze of the experts, the Spaceship finally broke through the Portal and landed only the vast battlefield.

“It’s here! It’s finally here!” the Samsara Temple Master clasped his hands together

“The war to decide fate of our Green Fire World is finally here!” the Void Temple Master ground his teeth together in anticipation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“We have been waiting for this moment for so long.” the Tang Emperor’s eyes were full of cold resolve.

80 years ago, when they first received information of the coming war, the Green Fire Palace was full of panic, and even the Palace Masters were shocked. Things were different now.

With 80 years of preparation and the help of all the elixris they had obtained, the extent of the Green Fire World’s power had grown greatly, and they renewed confidence in their ability to win the war.

Now, some were even looking forward to the war itself.

“Everyone, settle down as we wait for the Jin Kindgom.” the Sunrise Sword Emperor said with a serious tone.

“We must all fight bravely in this war!” the Samsara Temple Master boomed.

One by one, the Palace Masters’ eyes flashed with determination.

Suddenly, an expansive battlefiled appeared within the void.

The ancient Spaceship soared across several plains with terrifying speed, screeching to a halt at the mouth of a secret canyon.

Whoosh!

The shadow of a figure flashed within a cave, deep inside the canyon.

“Red Snow welcomes my Lord.”

The Red Snow King knelt in front of the Spaceship respectfully. Quickly, the shield surrounding the ship was unlocked and the Red Snow King stood to enter it.

At the center of the Spaceship, was a magnificent hall.

The handsome monarch of the Jin Kingdom wore a luxurious golden robe, and looked down at the Red Snow King kneeling in front of him.

“5 million years ago, I ordered you launch a sneak attack against our enemy. Unfortunately, your unit was sucked into the space storm and disappeared. This loss was a huge blow to the Jin Kingdom!” The monarch said coldly.

Hearing the tone of his sovereign’s voice, the Red Snow King trembled.

“I would have executed you for your mistakes, but luckily for you, you found this hidden base after being drawn into the snow storm, which has contributed to the growth of the Jin Kingdom. Your merits offset your faults, but only by a little. I will not blame you for your actions anymore, so get up, “declared the monarch.

“Thank you for your mercy, my Lord!” the Red Snow King quickly struggled to his feet, relieved.

“How is the fight going?” The monarch of the Jin Kingdom asked.

“Since our base near this battlefiled was destroyed by the Green Fire Palace, the Palace Masters have continued to search for other bases from the Jin Kingdom, and have occupied them one by one. Almost all of our remaining experts have been killed by them already, and as of now, the force that we have at this battlefield is extremely weak,” the Res Snow King answered.

“And what of Jian Wushuang? Did he manage to achieve a breakthrough during these 80 years?” The monarch of the Jin Kingdom asked.

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom didn’t care about the loss of their camps or the growing the number of Green Fire experts at all.

He only cared about Jian Wushuang.

He was the only one who could pose an actual threat to his life.

“Jian Wushuang…” the Red Snow King was silent for a while. He shook his head and said, “According to my spy in the Green Fire World, the Green Fire Palace has been preparing for this war for the past 80 years. As for any information on Jian Wushuang… he stays within the Green Fire Palace at all times, so I don’t know if he has broken through.

“Jian Wushuang does have great talent in cultivation, and is even considered by many to be a monster. However, since he just had a breakthrough 80 years ago, I highly doubt that his strength has improved by much.”

“Is that so?” The monarch of the JinKingdom lifted his eyebrow and waved his hand carelessly, saying, “Let’s go, we will send a greeting to the Green Fire Palace.”

Following his order, the Spaceship barreled toward the Green Fire Palace at an extraordinary speed.

The Spaceship’s level was even higher than Jian Wushuang’s, and any normal dangers that existed were easily avoided as they sped across the battlefield. Even the more dangerous areas were avoided with the help of the Red Snow King.

A few days later, the ancient Spaceship landed in front of the Green Fire Palace.

They were about 10 miles away from the palace itself.

“My Lord, the Green Fire Palace is located just ahead.” the Red Snow King pointed pointed in the direction of the palace and continued, “It’s a huge Battle Fortress, but has been greatly damaged by our attack 5 million years ago. It can now only activate a few of it’s former tactics. Having said this, the Palace and it’s power as a Battle Fortress was the only reason why I did not achieve victory in our last attack.”

“Battle Fortress.” The monarch of the Jin Kingdom sneered and said, “I suppose it is still valuable to them even with all of the damages. But there is nothing to worry about, I have also prepared, and I have ways to deal with the fortress.”

“Lord Jin Feng.”

A calm and beautiful woman sitting by a table looked at the monarch and said, “Are you going to use your weapon to destroy the fortress?”

“There’s no need to rush into things” The monarch of the Jin Kingdom dismissed her query with a flick of a hand and continued, “I have spent 5 million years preparing for this battle. It won’t be fun for anyone if I just destroy the Green Fire Palace. I want to play a game with them first.”

“Longxu!”

The monarch’s voice boomed.
