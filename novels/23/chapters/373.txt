Chapter 374: The Lin Family of the Iron Saber Territory

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When Jian Wushuang looked at the lady and the others, they stared back at him.

“This man parted the clouds and made his way here. He must be an expert of the Saint Realm, probably a newcomer from outside of the continent. If he was willing to help, there would be no need for me to risk going into the Waters.”

An idea quickly crossed the lady’s mind. She stepped forward and said to Jian Wushuang, “I’m Lin Lan from the Lin family. Please help me and we shall be greatly appreciative.”

Her words dazed the black-robed men, and they immediately looked toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang frowned. His rich experience told him that the lady and the man with her were being chased. They currently had no other way to save themselves besides asking him for help.

“The Lin family?”?Jian Wushuang showed a pondering smile.?“Since I just arrived in this land, I will need a place to stay. Perhaps the Lin family would be a good choice.”

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushuang cast cold look towards the black-robed men.

“Do you guys want to leave on your own, or do you want me to make you leave?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently to them.

Under the masks, the black-robed men’s faces became gloomy.

“Sir, you have nothing to do with our matters. You don’t necessarily have to get yourself involved,” the Half-saint who was leading them frowned and said.

“Yes, you’re right. But, I simply don’t like you,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

What he said was true.

He felt disgusted by what those men were wearing. Their black robes and masks reminded him of Blood Feather Tower.

They were dressed exactly the same as the assassins from Blood Feather Tower.

“Sir...” The leader tried to say something else.

However, Jian Wushuang stopped him, then lifted three fingers and said, “I’ll count to three, leave before then or stay here forever!”

“One!”

Jian Wushuang’s emotionless voice reverberated through the air.

All the black-robed men were filled with rage and despair.

Although they had the advantage in numbers, they still might die with a single stroke from the man standing in front of them. He had walked out of the Jiuqu Waters and was above the Saint Realm, whereas they were only at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

“Two!” Jian Wushuang continued.

“Let’s go!”

The leading black-robed man ordered.?No matter how reluctant they were, they had to leave.

“Thanks for your help, sir. I’ll remember this. May I have your name?” The lady asked after black-robed men left.

“Swordsman,” said Jian Wushuang, still choosing to use this pseudonym.

“Swordsman?” Lin Lan smiled and continued, “If I’m not mistaken, you’re from outside of the continent, and it’s your first time visiting the Divine Land.”

“You’re right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“The Divine Land is vast yet dangerous. Since it’s your first visit, I guess you don’t have a place to stay yet. If you don’t mind, you can follow me to my family. Though it’s not big, it still holds a place in Iron Saber Territory, and you’ll be our distinguished guest there. What do you say?” Lin Lan asked.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang blinked.

Her idea appealed to him. He was a newcomer in the Divine Land, and what he need was exactly that, a place to stay while he found his footing so he could make future plans.

Jian Wushuang took her advice, following her and Lei Yun to their home.

As soon as they arrived, a lot of people from the Lin family came out to meet them, with a slender elder leading them.

Catching sight of the elder, Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.?“A Saint Realm expert?”

The elder came up to the gate, but when he saw Lin Lan a strange expression appeared on his face, followed by a gentle smile, then he said, “Miss, you’re back!”

“Uncle Zong,” Lin Lan replied to him with a cold look. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Why is it only you and Lei Yun? Where are Lei Hao and the others?” The slender elder Lin Zong asked in confusion.

“They’re...” Lin Lan’s expression changed a bit.

“We encountered an attack during our trip. They were killed by the attackers while protecting Miss,” Lei Yun said in a low voice.

“What?” Lin Zong appeared surprised and then angrily growled, “Who the hell attacked you? How dare they!”

“Uncle Zong, do you really have no idea who those guys were?” Lin Lan glanced at Lin Zong and asked coldly.

“How could I know that?” Lin Zong answered while shaking his head, then he smiled gently and continued, “Luckily, you made it back safely, even though Lei Hao and the other two were not as lucky.”

After saying this, he headed inside the house.

Following behind Lin Lan, Jian Wushuang sensed something fishy about the discussion, but he kept silent.

“Well, this friend is...?” Lin Zong looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“He is Swordsman,” Lin Lan replied. “Without him, I wouldn’t have survived the attack.”

“Swordsman? Never heard of him.” Lin Zong raised his eyebrows.

“Of course, you couldn’t have heard of him since he just arrived here from outside of the continent,” Lin Lan explained.

“Oh, I see.” Lin Zong smiled silently, then said, “Since you’ve saved our Miss, sir, come on in with me.”

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded, but snorted inwardly.

A moment earlier, when Lin Zong stared at him, Jian Wushuang caught a gloomy glint in his eyes.

From this, Jian Wushuang could tell that Lin Zong must have had something to do with the attack.

The moment?Jian Wushuang stepped into the mansion, he sensed the obscure aura of seven experts in the Saint Realm. Plus Lin Zong, there was a total eight Saint Realm experts in the Lin family.

“The Divine Land is indeed a place of experts. Even in an ordinary family, there are so many Saint Realm experts.”?Jian Wushuang gasped inwardly in admiration.

Experts of the Saint Realm were rare in the Nanyang Continent, they were also the strongest. But, in Divine Land, they were nothing special. The first family Jian Wushuang met had eight of them, no less than the number in a top sect from Nanyang.

Jian Wushuang followed Lei Yun to a yard.

“Mr. Swordsman, Miss Lan’er told me to give you this. She thought you might need it.” Lei Yun gave Jian Wushuang an Interspatial Ring.

“Thanks!”

Jian Wushuang accepted the ring and began to read the information contained in it about the Divine Land.
