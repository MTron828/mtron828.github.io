Chapter 765: No Consequence Will Fall on You

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Yun Fan, what do you want?”

The crowd stood by Jian Wushuang, staring deadly at the elder…Yun Fan.

“Nothing. I’m just really curious how this boy, Jian Wushuang, managed to walk out of the Eternal Zone alive after staying inside for 100 years. What a strange thing, isn’t it?” Yun Fan answered with a smile.

Strange thing?

Indeed!

The Firmament Territory had been in the Eternal Zone for a long time. During those years, the experts from the Firmament Territory would enter the Eternal Zone once every 100 years. After all their expeditions, they have already affirmed a fact.

? ?Anyone would die if they did not leave within 10 days.

However, Jian Wushuang proved this wrong.

“This boy is the only one so far who has made it out alive after 100 years in the Eternal Zone. There must be something behind this.” The surrounding experts’ gaze became frenzied as they looked at Jian Wushuang.

The Eternal Zone was a land of both opportunities and dangers.

The Ancient God Clan, which lived in the Eternal Zone, was very unique.

Although the experts from the Firmament Territory had adventured into this land countless times, they only managed to attain a small fraction of the opportunities.

However, they were still kept clear of the real big opportunity, the real big secret that was hidden in the Eternal Zone.

They had been dying to attain the real big opportunity. However, none of them was powerful enough to battle the Ancient God Clan.

There were once two Dao Masters from the Firmament Territory who also wanted to venture into the deepest parts of Eternal Zone, where the Demon Gods’ so-called tribes were located at. However, once they entered the Eternal Zone, they immediately encountered some of the Three-star Ancient Gods. Their adventure ended with them running away in a hurry.

For so many years, they knew that the Firmament Territory could be a huge treasure on its own, but it was one that they would never attain. All that they could get were the insignificant Baptismal Pools and Essence Blood of Demon God.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang made it out alive, they saw hope.

Jian Wushuang noticed the fervent gazes on him and he was not surprised. He poured out the words he prepared in advance.

“100 years ago, I ran into danger in the Eternal Zone and did not get out in time. Later, I found a secret place in the zone and hid in it the whole time. I didn’t come out even once until several days ago, and I was lucky to meet our Palace Masters again and managed to leave the zone with them.”

“Hiding for 100 years?” Yun Fan raised his eyebrows, saying, “You had been hiding in the Eternal Zone for 100 years but yet not one Demon God found you? And you even managed to find the people from Ancient Sect? Well, it seems that you are really lucky.”

Despite his words, Yun Fan was not convinced.

Apart from him, none of the surrounding experts believed Jian Wushuang’s words. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hiding in the Eternal Zone for 100 years?

If it was possible for someone to hide in the Eternal Zone for 100 years without being found, all those who had failed to leave the zone in the past should have been able to as well.

“Elder Yun Fan, is there anything else?” Jian Wushuang looked at the elder with calm eyes.

“Yes, one more.” The elder replied. “100 years ago, your master, Xuan Yi, killed seven Eternal Realm experts of our sect to take revenge for your death.

“Back then, everyone thought that you were dead. Considering that our disciples did attack you first in the Eternal Zone, we did not fight back against him at that time, nor did we continue to harp onto the matter.”

“But now, you turn out to be alive. Then we should talk about how you can make up for our loss.”

The elder’s voice became colder as he talked.

“Make up for your loss? How do you want me to do that?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I just want you to stay at our sect as a guest for a period of time,” Yun Fan said.

“A guest?” Jian Wushuang looked nonchalant, but he knew it was a trick.

Jian Wushuang knew that he meant to keep him as a prisoner rather than a guest. While doing so, the Cloud Sea Asgard would then think of ways to learn about the secrets of the Eternal Zone and Ancient God Clan from him.

“What if I say no?” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“If you say so, then don’t blame me for being merciless.” Yun Fan’s expression turned cold suddenly. As those words escaped his mouth, he held up his pale hand and pointed his index finger at Jian Wushuang.

Immediately, a fully-formed substantial wild wind of Spiritual Power blew violently towards Jian Wushuang.

Seeing that, Palace Master Destruction shouted loudly. “Yun Fan, what are you doing? Don’t forget that Jian Wushuang is Xuan Yi’s personal disciple. ”

“Humph!”

Yun Fan snorted and ignored Palace Master Destruction’s words. The wild wind did not die down. Instead, its momentum grew even stronger and enveloped Jian Wushuang.

Woosh… the strong wind raged in the sky. Soon, it formed a black light cocoon and enveloped Jian Wushuang inside it.

He stood still in the light cocoon and watched it envelop him completely. However, Jian Wushuang did not even struggle.

At this time, he took out a Messaging Slip and sent a message to Xuan Yi.

“Master, I’m back.” The message was simple and straight to the point.

“I see. It’s good to have you back.” Xuan Yi replied to him immediately in a calm tone.

Jian Wushuang could not help but feel that something was not right.?“It seems that Master has expected my return. Did he know that I didn’t die?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and did not think about it further. He sent another message to Xuan Yi. “Master, though I made it out of the Eternal Zone alive, I’m in trouble now…”

Before he could finish his words, Xuan Yi interrupted him, saying, “The three magnates have always wanted to kill you. Now that you are the first one to come out of the Eternal Zone alive, it is normal that they would cause trouble for you.”

“It would be strange if they do not make things difficult for you.”

Xuan Yi seemed to have long expected Jian Wushuang’s current situation.

“Kid, you’ve been in the Eternal Zone for 100 years, your strength must have increased quite a lot, right?” Xuan Yi asked suddenly.

“Well… yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded repeatedly and asked, “Master, why are you asking me this?”

There was a silence before Xuan Yi spoke again.

“As your Master, I know what you’re thinking about.

“What I’m trying to say is…

“Do what you want to do with no hesitation!”

“With me here, no consequence will fall on you!”
