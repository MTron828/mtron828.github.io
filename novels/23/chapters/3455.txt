Chapter 3456 Xiao’er’s Hatred

“Jian Wushuang, you seem to have heard of him?” Xiao’er asked.

“I do know him. Not only that, I have met him and had many dealings with him,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You have met him?” Xiao’er’s body suddenly trembled. “How is that possible? He died in battle when the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed. How many years has it been since that battle? How can you have met him?”

“Is he still alive?” Xiao’er looked at Jian Wushuang with an unprecedented glint in her eyes.

Jian Wushuang naturally noticed the look in Xiao’er’s eyes. At the same time, he could see the anxiety and anticipation in her eyes. It was obvious that Miss Xiao’er had long determined that Di Shisan had died with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect.

After hesitating for a moment, Jian Wushuang raised his head again and said, “Di Shisan...is indeed alive.”

Upon hearing this, the light in Xiao’er’s eyes instantly soared to the maximum, and her face revealed a look of ecstasy.

“Really?” Xiao’er was still a little apprehensive.

“Of course it’s true. To tell you the truth, he was the one who guided me to truly enter the sword principle. Moreover, he once saved my life and was a great benefactor to me,” Jian Wushuang said. “Where is he now? Why hasn’t there been any news about him after so many years?” Xiao’er asked hurriedly.

“It’s because his current location is very special and completely isolated from the Divine Beginning Realm. Of course, I know about the existence of that place, but I’m still too weak. It’s still unknown whether I can enter it successfully. However, it won’t be long before I go there. As long as I can re-open that space, not only Di Shisan but also many experts left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect will have a chance to see the light of day again,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s great, that’s great!” Xiao’er was so excited that she did not know what to do. Even after so many years, no one could replace Di Shisan in her heart.

“Miss Xiao’er, if I really enter that space and see Di Shisan in the future, I will naturally tell them about you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Xiao’er was filled with anticipation.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang asked, “Miss Xiao’er, did you just say that the Nine-tailed Clan abandoned you because of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and Di Shisan?”

“Yes.” Xiao’er nodded slightly. “At that time, Di Shisan and I were in love, and we matched each other in terms of status and background. Our marriage was decided. Everything was going well, but something unexpected happened. It happened during the world-ending war!” “In that war, the three Saint Realms led the attack. With the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao, many top forces of the Divine Beginning Realm attacked the Seven Star Mysterious Sect at the same time!

“At that time, no one knew the exact reason. The four divine races and the Eight Directions Divine Sect didn’t care if they had any grudges with the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. They all obeyed the orders of the three Saint Realms and charged into the Seven Star Mysterious Realm together. “You have to know that at that time, Di Shisan and I were already engaged. Everyone knew Di Shisan’s status in the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. The nine-tailed race and the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were already on good terms. Logically, the nine-tailed race should be on the side of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. However, in reality, the nine-tailed race also listened to the orders of the three great Saint Realms. They betrayed their trust and charged into the Seven Star Mysterious Sect together!”

“As the Saintess of the Nine-tailed Clan, I naturally opposed it. However, not only did the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan not care about my position, she even ordered me to be secretly executed when she found out that I was going to the Seven Star Mysterious Sect to fight together with Di Shisan!”

“How could that be?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “Even if the patriarch of the Nine-tailed Clan forbade you to have any relationship with Di Shisan for some special reasons, he shouldn’t have killed you directly. After all, you have the Emperor Phoenix Bloodline.”

“Emperor Phoenix Bloodline?”

“Humph, in that era, there were two people in the Nine-tailed Clan who had awakened the Emperor Phoenix Bloodline. Besides me, the other one was Di Xi’s daughter. Di Xi wanted his daughter to inherit her position and become the next patriarch of the Nine-tailed Clan. Therefore, he made things difficult for me in the Nine-tailed Clan. And that time, he found an opportunity to kill me!” Xiao’er sneered.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had said that things could not be so simple. It turned out that there was a struggle for the patriarch’s throne.

“You were indeed looking for an opportunity to kill me, but unfortunately, my reputation in the Nine-tailed Clan was not low at that time. Many elders of the Nine-tailed Clan were on my side at the beginning. Although everyone objected because of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, many elders did not agree to my execution. In the end, one of the elders who was closest to me secretly let me go. However, Di Xi continued to pursue me and killed me. In the end, I died at her hands!” Xiao’er said.

“She killed you?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes, I did die once, but it was an opportunity for me to find the cultivation method of the nine-life succubus skill. I entered the reincarnation passage and began my nine-life cultivation journey...” Xiao’er stopped. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After a while, she looked up again. “Jian Wushuang, you should know why I hate the Nine-tailed Clan, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

It was true that Miss Xiao’er was a member of the Nine-tailed Clan and an extremely important possessor of the Emperor Phoenix Bloodline. However, the entire Nine-tailed Clan had abandoned her, and she was even hunted down and killed once, now that she had finally experienced the nine reincarnations and cultivated the nine-life charm to perfection, she had the ability to fight against the Nine-tailed Clan. Naturally, she wanted revenge.

“Miss Xiao’er, although the Nine-tailed Clan has treated you unfairly and indeed abandoned you, you still have the bloodline of the Nine-tailed Clan. Moreover, it’s not as if no one in the Nine-tailed Clan was on your side back then. I can understand that you hate the Nine-tailed Clan, but if you want to destroy the Nine-tailed Clan just like that, it’s too...” Jian Wushuang had not finished his sentence.

Xiao’er waved her hand, “I know. That’s why my initial goal was not to destroy the nine-tailed race. All I wanted to do was to take back what originally belonged to me. Besides that, there’s also Di Xi. Although she went to the universe battlefield, her descendants are still fine within the nine-tailed race and are still occupying the position of clan leader.”
