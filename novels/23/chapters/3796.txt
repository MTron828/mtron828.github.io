Chapter 3801: Surprise

“Surprise?” The four Rulers were surprised.

“The surprise is in this interspatial ring. Take a look.” Jian Wushuang took out the interspatial ring.

“Guess what the surprise will be?” Daoist Xuan God smiled and looked at the three people around him.

“In my opinion, it should be one or two Supreme Treasures.” The Heaven Ancestor’s eyes lit up.

“For the Heavenly Marquis to treat it as a pleasant surprise, it must be something that we can use. It’s most likely a Supreme True Treasure, and it might also be a special opportunity,” said the leader of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“Could it be a special treasure comparable to the heaven-subduing stele?” The Temporal Temple Master guessed.

The four of them were chatting and guessing, but their consciousness had already sunk into the cosmos ring. Soon, they swept through the items in the interspatial ring.

Immediately, the eyes of these four Rulers who were absolutely high and mighty in the Divine Beginning Realm widened. Even their mouths could not help but open.

They were completely stunned.

There was nothing they could do. The things in the cosmos ring were really too shocking.

“Supreme Treasures. All of them are Supreme Treasures. Judging from their auras, they are all Pinnacle Supreme Treasures?”

“There are so many Pinnacle True Treasures! There must be tens of thousands of them!”

“No, no! Not only Pinnacle True Treasures! There are also Supreme True Treasures! Look carefully!”

The four of them scanned the ring with their consciousness. Indeed, there were a lot of Pinnacle True Treasures in the ring. There were also some True Treasures that gave off auras that were far superior to those of Pinnacle True Treasures. That unique aura...it was something that only a Supreme True Treasure could possess.

“It’s a Supreme True Treasure, and there are more than one or two of them. There must be dozens of them, right?”

“How is that possible?”

“This, this...”

“How can there be so many Supreme True Treasures and Pinnacle True Treasures?”

The four Rulers were all shocked.

Pinnacle True Treasures were considered extremely precious in this Star Field, and even Rulers would attach great importance to them. After all, it was very rare for Principles Masters to have Pinnacle True Treasures in this Star Field, most Rulers only used Pinnacle True Treasures, and many did not have a Supreme True Treasure in their hands.

As for Supreme True Treasures, there was no need to mention them. Any one of them was enough to make Rulers envious and even go crazy. It was as crazy as the fight in the Red Cloud World, and those Rulers were so eager, they wanted to get the Supreme True Treasures that were born in the Red Cloud World.

Since Jian Wushuang said that he had brought them a surprise, the four of them guessed that Jian Wushuang’s surprise might be a Supreme True Treasure.

If there were only a few Pinnacle True Treasures or two or three Supreme True Treasures in the interspatial ring, they would not be so surprised.

However, the key point was that there were tens of thousands of Pinnacle True Treasures in the interspatial ring.

There were also dozens of Supreme True Treasures.

With so many Supreme True Treasures, how could they not be excited?

“Heavenly Marquis!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

The four Rulers looked at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes.

“Heavenly Marquis, how many Supreme True Treasures and Supreme True Treasures are there in the interspatial ring?” Temporal Temple Master asked excitedly.

“There are 100,000 pinnacle treasures in total. As for Supreme Treasures, there are 100 of them,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“100,000 Pinnacle Treasures and 100 Supreme Treasures?” The four Rulers were a little confused.

They were really shocked by the number, and it took them a long time to come back to their senses.

“My Heavenly Marquis friend, what’s going on? What great opportunity did you get in the Second Heaven of Earth in the Red Cloud World?” Daoist Xuan God asked.

“Well...” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled. “I can only say that there is a great opportunity in the Red Cloud World, but I can’t tell you what it is because of some special relationships. However, I can tell you the origin of these Supreme Treasures. They are all Supreme Treasures in the Red Cloud World, and only a small part of them.”

“A small part?” The four Rulers were stunned.

“You know that every time the Red Cloud World is opened, a large number of True Treasures will be born. The Red Cloud World has been born many times, but there are still countless True Treasures each time. This is mainly because there is a huge True Treasure vault in the Red Cloud World. There are hundreds of millions of True Treasures there, and there are also many Supreme True Treasures,” Jian Wushuang said.

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard the four Rulers throbbing their throats.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised by this.

Even he was shocked when he heard Lord Wu mention the Supreme Treasures in the Red Cloud World. However, when he learned about the existence of the Principles Supreme Treasures, he gradually understood.

“These hundreds of millions of Supreme Treasures are incredible to our Star Field. However, the Red Cloud World has a huge history, so these Supreme Treasures are nothing to the Red Cloud World. I passed the test of Heaven-Treading Mountain, so the lord in charge of the Red Cloud World asked me to enter the treasure vault to pick out the Supreme Treasures. He gave me the authority to pick out 100 Supreme Treasures. As for the Pinnacle Supreme Treasures, he didn’t have too many restrictions. If I want them, I can even pick out hundreds of thousands of pinnacle Supreme Treasures.”

“However, I thought it might not be a good thing if there were too many Supreme Treasures, so I chose 100,000 of them. As for your 100 Supreme Treasures, I chose them carefully,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The faces of the four Rulers in front of them had long turned red, and they were breathing heavily. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had given them a big surprise.

However, the four Rulers had experienced many storms, so they soon calmed down.

“My young friend, you’ve really given us a big surprise this time,” Daoist Xuan God praised.

“Indeed.” Temporal Temple Master nodded. “100,000 Supreme True Treasures and 100 Supreme True Treasures. There are all kinds of Supreme True Treasures, and there are so many of them. If this batch of Supreme True Treasures is taken out, it will definitely cause a huge wave in this Star Field. Countless Rulers will probably go crazy because of it.”

“If we had known that you could get so many Supreme True Treasures after passing through Heaven-Treading Mountain, we wouldn’t have risked our lives to kill Pupil Master for a Supreme True Treasure Armor.” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master curled his lips and said.

“Haha...” Jian Wushuang also smiled.

“By the way, my young friend, how do you plan to distribute these Supreme True Treasures?” Daoist Xuan God looked at him.

“I have already thought about how to distribute them on the way back.” Jian Wushuang became serious.
