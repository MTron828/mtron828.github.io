Chapter 57: Swordsman, Outburst of Power!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the roof, Jian Wushuang had the aura of a master swordsman as he stared at those black-robed men with a chilling expression. Both sides continued moving towards each other.

The black-robed men fiercely raced across the rooftops. Upon noticing Jian Wushuang standing in their way, their eyes flashed with killing intent.

“Kill him,” said one of the black-robed men.

Like to said to Mr. Huo, they only wanted to leave. But if someone wanted to stop them, they would attack and kill them without hesitation. Jian Wushuang was clearly planning to stop them.

“Swordsman, retreat!”

“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”

Yin Min and Ling Tianhao shouted widely at Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang did not move at all.

“Retreat? Should I retreat?”

“Impossible!” Jian Wushuang roared in his heart.

He was too weak four months ago, so he could only run away while being chased by a great number of silver and golden masked assassins from the Blood Feather Tower. But now, four months later, everything had changed. More importantly, his opponents were just one silver masked assassin and eight copper masked assassins.

They were not strong enough to make him retreat.

Since he did not have to retreat, he would fight!

“I couldn’t afford to stand out in the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace because there were too many people around. But everything that happens during the Golden-dragon Palace task is top secret. No one would dare to spread the information. So I don’t have to worry about drawing attention or my true strength being revealed.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head, looking at them with cold eyes that were void of any emotion. He moved directly in front of the black-robed men and abruptly swung his Triple-kill sword.

The first move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow!

The speed of his sword flashed out. At this moment, it was even more incredible, cold, and harsh than ever before.

On the roof, except for the silver-masked man, the other eight black-robed men saw a dazzling sword light move towards them, with the reflection in their eyes growing larger.

The sword light was too fast.

A hint of panic could be felt coming from the eight black-robed men. In the next moment, the sword flash swept past the necks of those eight men without any obstruction.

The eight black-robed men fell down without making a sound.

All of a sudden, the whole Tianhuan Sect went dead still.

Silence, dead silence!

Everyone in the Tianhuan Sect was shocked by this terrifying sword speed.

On top of the roof, the silver-masked man in a black robe was the only one still standing in front of Jian Wushuang. He glanced at the black-robed men who had all just died and felt frightened.

He also saw the stroke from Jian Wushuang.

The only one stroke swept past the necks of the eight men at an amazing speed, killing all eight of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm assassins from Blood Feather Tower.

“Who are you?” The silver-masked man in a black robe asked with unprecedented seriousness.

“I am Swordsman,” Jian Wushuang answered indifferently.

“I only want to leave here. I’m not trying to impede your task and I’m not a person from the Tianhuan Sect. I shouldn’t be a target from your task,” the silver-masked man in a black robe said in a low voice.

“It has nothing to do with the Golden-dragon Palace. You were all dead the moment I saw you,” Jian Wushuang said without any emotion.

“Let’s see who die first!” The silver-masked man in a black robe turned into a stream of light and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. A dark red dagger pierced the air and immediately moved towards Jian Wushuang’s head with an unprecedented speed. At the same time, a gruff voice from the silver-masked man in black robe rang out,

“Go to hell.”

The eyes of the silver-masked man in a black robe were filled with killing intent. As an assassin at the silver mask level in the Blood Feather Tower, his first move was a slaughter move.

“Ridiculous!” said Jian Wushuang. Smiling indifferently, he and charged toward the killer.

This seemingly casual sword move was the first move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.

The speed of the sword light was unbelievably quick.

“That was the sword movement.”

The grey-robed elder, Mr. Huo, concentrated on this rooftop fight in the near distance. He looked serious. “Sword Essence of Gale, he grasped a sense of theSword Essence of Gale. And his understanding of it is very deep. The sword movement was so quick.”

Yes, the speed was very fast.

The dark red dagger had not reached Jian Wushuang, yet the sword light from Jian Wushuang’s attack had already moved towards the silver-masked man in a black robe.

Clang!

As a deep metal crash sounded, the silver-masked man suddenly felt a strong power surge through his dark red dagger. The power of the clash instantly numbed his hands and forced him to retreat.

The silver-masked man gaped in shock at Jian Wushuang , “He hasn’t reach Primordial Golden Core, but his Spiritual Power is as strong as mine. More importantly, his swordsmanship is faster and superior to mine.”

“Sword Essence!”

“Yes, he has grasped a sense of Sword Essence.”

It was no wonder that the silver-masked man in a black robe was so stunned. He could tell that Jian Wushuang had not reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill yet.

After all, Spiritual Power had a qualitative change once it reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill. Once it was released, Spiritual Power at the Primordial Golden Pill level couldn’t be hidden. He didn’t sense an aura at the level of the Golden Pill from Jian Wushuang.

So he was sure that Jian Wushuang had not reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill Realm.

This alone was enough to thoroughly surprise him.

He has reached the peak of Initial Gold Core Realm, and there was only one step away from Profound Gold Core Realm. He used a slaughter move, but he was thoroughly defeated by Jian Wushuang, who had not even reached the Gold Core yet.

“What does it mean?”

“Run!”

The silver-masked man in a black robe instantly made a decision.

He could only run.

As an assassin, speed was his strong point, so he fled for his life. However, the speed of Jian Wushuang was much faster than his.

“Trying to escape?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“What?” The silver-masked man in a black robe was astonished and filled with a sense of bitterness. “Warriors with a sense of the Sword Essence of Gale are best at speed.”

“Go to hell,” Jian Wushuang said while releasing a strong killing intent.

It was the second move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Sword-killing Movement.

A dazzling and bloody sword light appeared.

“This strike is even faster and stronger than the previous one.” The silver-masked man in a black robe was full of despair and he even gave up on fighting back at this moment. The dazzling bloody sword light easily slashed out through his neck.

Spurt!

The silver-masked man in a black robe, at the level of Initial Gold Core Realm, was lying dead on the ground.
