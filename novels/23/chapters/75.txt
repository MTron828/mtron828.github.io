Chapter 76: Formless Sword Ripple

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Haha, freshman, you should be careful.”

Nangong Jie’s laugh rang out on Martial Arts Practice Field. Chuu! A cold sword shadow broke the air and moved towards Jian Wushuang.

The sword edge was cold enough to tear through anything.

“Formless Swordsmanship? ” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Jian Wushang was very familiar with this sword skill. Nangong Jie was using the first move of the Formless Sword Art, Blood Shadow.

Jian Wushuang drew his sword and used the Formless Sword Art too.

The two sword shadows were both incredibly fast. They entwined with each other like two serpents, then separated immediately after colliding.

“Fuck off!”

Followed by a howl, the long sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand drew up immediately, filled with killing intent.

A fresh bloody sword shadow moved through the air like it was dancing in the wind.

In an instant, the air was cut through directly.

“Haha.”

Nangong Jie laughed. Then he moved his wrist and used the same sword movement.

It started with the First Move, Blood Shadow, then came the Second Move, Sword-killing Movement.

They were tied again at the end.

“Time for a different skill.” Jian Wushuang had a cold look in his eyes.

Whoosh!

A sword shadow immediately stabbed out. It seemed very slow, but the real speed was astonishingly fast.

The fourth move of Formless Swordsmanship, One Hundred Illusions!

“The fourth move? Ridiculous,” Nangong Jie yelled out and grinned.

The same slow sword came out from Nangong Jie.

They struck each other and then separated at the same time.

Jian Wushuang stared at Nangong Jie with a dignified look.

“Swordsman, this is your level of strength after earnest cultivation in Dragon Palace for three months?” Nangong Jie stared at Jian Wushuang with a little derision, “it is really brave of you to take out those 12,000 points and fight with only this much strength. Stupid enough. ”

“I will show you my real strength.”

After saying that, Nangong Jie prepared to make his next move.

Weng… It seemed slow, but it was actually an astonishingly fast strike. Nangong Jie still used the fourth move, One Hundred Illusions.

It was the same move, but it was twice as fast as before.

The previous sword strike was already extremely fast. How did he manage to reach a speed that was twice as fast as before?

“So fast !”

Jian Wushuang’s complexion couldn’t help changing when he saw that terrifying speed sword.

“You lose,” Nangong Jie growled in an excited voice at that moment.

“Will he be defeated?” All the people around there paid attention to the scene, watched as the sword light approached Jian Wushuang.

“Hmm!”

After the Hum, Sword Essence of Earth was released from Jian Wushuang’s sword. A thorough and majestic sword shadow struck out.

The sword shadow seemed to be overlapped by numerous sword shadows, striking out violently.

It seemed like a 100-million pound mountain, grinding everything as it violently moved forwards. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What?” Nangong Jie’s complexion changed a lot. Before he could respond, the “100-million pound mountain” reached him.

Peng!

The loud roar shook the whole space instantly, with its power forming several shock waves. It even swept away many disciples of Dragon Palace that were too close at that time.

After that strike, on the battleground, Nangong Jie was knocked back awkwardly. He quickly noticed a sharp pain in his palm and a little blood.

A giant sword scar, nearly a foot wide, was left on the ground in front of him.

Lots of disciples of Dragon Palace around there gasped after seeing the sword scar.

“It was the seventh move, Formless Sword Wave. ” Some disciples of Dragon Palace immediately recognized the swordsmanship Jian Wushuang used just now.

“Formless Sword Wave? ” Nangong Jie felt stressed.

There were a lot of sword skills in the Secret Pavilion. That included some famous ones, such as Formless Sword Wave. He knew that.

Formless Sword Wave was quite fitting for warriors who comprehended the Sword Essence of Earth. In general, if you could fully use the sixth move, you would be able to pass the fifth level in the Dragon Gate. As for the seventh move, it was no problem to get past the sixth level in the Dragon Gate.

“I was too careless. I didn’t expect his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Earth to be much higher than the Sword Essence of Gale, but… this is the end. I will not give him another chance to use that move.” Nangong Jie thought solemnly.

The seventh move, Formless Sword Wave, was powerful. A sane person would not confront the toughness with toughness. However, Warriors who comprehended the Sword Essence of Gale depended on speed, rather than strength.

“Nangong Jie!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice rang out suddenly. His black eyes stared at this Nangong Jie with indifference.

“You said you would show me your real strength just now, and I’ve seen it.” Jian Wushuang spoke, with a grin that was similar to a blade, “Now, I’ll let you see my real strength.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang held the Triple-kill Sword with both hands, raising the Long Sword high.

Wengweng~~~ The splendid Sword Essence of Earth reached its peak at that moment.

Boom!

Such a terrifying sword stroke.

Before the sword stroke landed, everyone already felt a horrible power was continuously condensing. The momentum in Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword increased suddenly and sharply.

Everyone saw a giant sword shadow forming slowly, three meters long and half-meter wide.

Oppression!

The moment the giant sword shadow formed, the oppressive atmosphere reached its peak.

The air seemed to shiver.

“Formless Sword Wave, the eighth move!” Jian Wushuang shouted out suddenly.

The huge streak of sword shadow drew everyone’s attention. With a soaring aura, it wavered slightly and then lashed out.

The world suddenly changed colors.

“The eighth move? Can it really be the eighth move?” Nangong Jie’s eye opened widely.

He was already shocked when Jian Wushuang used the seventh move. Now, Jian Wushuang was about to use the eighth move…

It was well-known that anyone who was able to perform the seventh move was qualified to reach the sixth level.

“The eighth move?”

The Formless Sword Wave, eighth move, along with his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Earth, was enough to pass the seventh level.

Seventh floor!

Although he fought fiercely with the keeper of the seventh floor for a long time when he went through the Dragon Gate yesterday, he knew that it was not a fierce fight. Instead, It was a very suffocating fight because he was completely suppressed by the keeper.

He only managed to prolong the fight for a while by relying on his speed.

He clearly understood that he was far from being able to pass the seventh level.

But now, someone who entered Dragon Palace for only three months ago, surpassed him completely incomprehension of Sword Essence.

Nangong Jie was dumbfounded when the splendid, giant sword shadow, hacked directly towards him. Following that, an unprecedented look of madness appeared on his face.

“Swordsman, you made me do this!”
