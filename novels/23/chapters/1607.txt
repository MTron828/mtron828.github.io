Chapter 1608: Unique Skill, Myriad Waves!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Wow! Wow! Wow!

Three flowing lights grazed.

The three flowing lights burst out at the same time. Suddenly, they formed a brand new flowing light with a tremendous increase in power.

It tore the void into pieces straight away.

The image stopped right there and then.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded and he was stunned on the spot.

“How could it?”

There was shock in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, “The three flowing lights weren’t strong separately, but when the three superposed, the brand new flowing light that was formed was at least ten times stronger or maybe even more. How is that possible?”

Jian Wushuang thought that when the three attacks of similar power superposed, the newly formed attack would only perform power by threefold at the most, even if there wasn’t any power dispersed.

However, in the image, the three flowing lights of similar power overlapped and superposed, and gave out power that was more than ten times stronger.

Then, he associated with the Ten Waves that he created.

Ten Waves was a crystallization of ten sword shadows that derived from his sword intention, divine power, and comprehension towards doctrine. When the ten sword shadows superposed together, there was a large amount of power spillage during the process of superposing. Hence, the newly formed sword shadow would at most possess five times the power.

Jian Wushuang knew about it too. Hence, he had been thinking for ways to familiarize himself with the power superposition skill in order to decrease power spillage. In turn, the brand new sword shadow would be able to explode with a stronger power. However, he had never imagined the ten sword shadows of similar power could combine and explode twenty, thirty or even a hundred times the power.

He had no idea at all.

However, the image before him…

“I now understand why senior told me to come before this stele,” Jian Wushuang smiled

The instant he saw the stele, Jian Wushuang had a brand new understanding about Ten Waves that he created.

“There are different power superposition skills. Ten Waves that I created superposed ten shadows instantly and forcibly. With such a brutal method, no matter how perfect one manages the strength, it will still cause power spillage, but then the image showed… the power superposition skill is obviously different. Besides, the law and order of the strength in the claw were different too.

Jian Wushuang muttered and in the next moment, he continued to watch the demonstration and learn from the image of the unique skill.

He watched the three flowing lights burst out in the image again. Then, the three flowing lights superposed and formed a brand new flowing light.

Jian Wushuang watched the process of superposing carefully and felt the law of manipulation of the divine power meticulously.

“Previously, I thought one plus one definitely equalled two. In a similar fashion, if ten sword shadows of the same power superposed and formed a brand new shadow intention, it could only explode the power by tenfold. But now, I know that as long as the manipulation method is proper, one plus one could also equal to three, or four. Hence, ten sword shadows of the same power superposed and formed a brand new shadow intention, could explode the power by tenfold or even a hundredfold!”

Jian Wushuang smiled as he immersed himself entirely in demonstration and comprehension.

On Thunderbolt Island there were opportunities everywhere.

Most of the opportunities required luck.

When one was lucky, he would even run into it randomly.

Jian Wushuang obviously ran into one.

The opportunity that he ran into should be the weird old man. The weird old man guided him and told him about the existence of the stele.

If there wasn’t the weird old man, it might be impossible for him to find the region for this claw unique skill in his lifetime and stayed back to watch the stele with a simple claw print.

He naturally wouldn’t have the current opportunity then either.

As time flew past, Jian Wushuang continued to stay before the stele. It had been thirty years in total.

In the thirty years, there were many Real Gods who had come there and were shocked when they saw Jian Wushuang.

After all, they knew that Jian Wushuang was good with swords.

A sword principle cultivator came to the region of claw unique skill to learn about claw unique skills? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They didn’t understand what Jian Wushuang was doing but they didn’t worry either.

At the stele, Jian Wushuang continued to close his eyes. However, his index finger formed a sword. An outstanding sword intention along with Power of Heaven Way formed ten small sword lights in the void next to him. As he moved his index fingers, the ten small sword lights were instantly superposed and overlapped. The power increased tremendously all of a sudden.

“Haha, I succeeded!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and there was joy across his face.

“Although I only just began to master the power superposition skill and the power has already dispersed quite a bit, the brand new sword light still needs to be strengthened by ten times!”

“This is only the beginning. I am not familiar with the power superposition skill. If I were to continue to comprehend and study. The superpose of sword intention will definitely explode to a stronger power,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

“Continue!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes again and started comprehension.

In the void above Jian Wushuang, the weird old man with a white bone necklace overlooked. He also saw the scene where he had performed his sword principle.

“This young man, in just thirty years, has understood the power superposition skill that I studied painstakingly? Although it is only the beginning, he has already passed the beginner level? Then it is only a matter of time to master and familiarize himself with it entirely.” The weird old man squinted his eyes but his facial expression grew strange.

“D*mn it, when I first studied power superposition skill, I spent a total of three hundred thousand years of continuous repetitive polishing and perfecting, but this young man… He didn’t even put in much effort but only picked it up ready-made and mastered the power superposition skill?”

“No way, no way. Isn’t that too easy for him?”

“I went through so much trouble to get it…”

The weird old man’s facial expression looked complicated. He seemed happy yet sad. It was strange.

After a while, his gaze suddenly fixed and he made a decision. There was a malicious smile spread across his face.

At the stele, Jian Wushuang continued to comprehend carefully.

He was already at the beginner level of power superposition skill. The following familiarization and mastering would be much easier but the time required was more.

In the blink of an eye, fifty years passed and Jian Wushuang finally got up.

“After comprehending for eighty years, I finally mastered the power superposition skill flawlessly. My Ten Waves, the brand new sword shadow formed by the superposition of the ten sword shadows, its power increased by thirty times!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Thirty times was already the limit of the power superposition skill. Jian Wushuang was content with the result.

Because of his Ten Waves, the power increased tremendously. And, most importantly, from then on, not only at the level of Universe God but to the level of Real God, it was not necessary for him to create another attack unique skill.

In the aspect of attack unique skills, one was enough.

“Ten waves… No, it should be called Myriad Waves. It’s more suitable!”
