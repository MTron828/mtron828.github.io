The incident of Jian Wushuang passing through the God’s Test stirred a commotion up within Dayu World. All the experts from various forces were surprised.

But the hubbub merely lasted for a short period of time until it settled down.

For the rest of the time, Jian Wushuang continued to stay in Dayu Palace and resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat before the Little Scattered Stars Game whilst the fifty-second black chess piece slowly dispersed from the chess set.

“As expected, after becoming Universe God, the speed of me resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game is much faster than before,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He was in seclusion for less than seven days but he resolved the fifty-second move of the Little Scattered Stars Game very quickly.

One must remember that he spent a few years time to resolve the fifty-first step when he was a Universe Master.

“Don’t think about how fast you can resolve the move. Take your time and accumulate slowly, according to the method I taught you. Then, you will gain huge rewards,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Then, he continued to resolve the fifty-third move. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The time flew past.

Another sixty years passed.

“Done!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and had a smile plastered on his face. On the Little Scattered Stars Game before him, the last black chess piece dispersed. There was nothing left on the huge chess set.

“Sixty years, from the fifty-first move, you resolved the hundred-moves Little Scattered Stars Game. If the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang were to find out, they might be embarrassed,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard.

“Hah!” Jian Wushuang laughed.

After becoming a Universe God, it became easier to resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game and his speed was naturally faster. On top of that, he followed King of Venomous Worms’ instruction to accumulate slowly. Hence, there was almost no bottleneck situation later in the game. That’s why he could resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game entirely in such a short period of time.

“I originally thought that the Little Scattered Stars Game wouldn’t be much use after I became a Universe God. However, from the way it seems, not only was it useful for me, it’s very useful for me. Now that I have resolved the entire game, I have reaped a bumper harvest,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

In the sixty years, his understanding towards the nature of swordsmanship increased tremendously. Then, if he was given time, he could definitely create an even stronger unique skill.

“Don’t panic. Follow Lord Wu Cang to Snow Dojo first. On the way, I can slowly digest the accumulated Sword Principle and then create a unique skill,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

Wu Cang and the Master of the Dayu were done three years ago and they sent a message to Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang was in the last stage of resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game then. Hence, he made Wu Cang waited for him.

When Jian Wushuang left the secret room, he immediately planned to leave with Wu Cang.

In Dayu World, at the border of the floating land, there was a boundless dark void before them.

Wu Cang waved.

Swoosh!

A huge green spaceship appeared from nowhere.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s go,” Wu Cang appeared first on the green spaceship.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate, leaping onto the Wu Cang’s spaceship. The green spaceship immediately set off at a terrifying speed and moved towards Snow Dojo.

…

In the dark void, it was total darkness. There was almost no light at all.

A green spaceship swept past in the dark void. The speed was far beyond a Universe God’s ability.

In a cabin of the green spaceship, Wu Cang sat calmly while he sipped on his wine. He stole glances at Jian Wushuang next to him occasionally.

“Jian Wushuang is making a painstaking effort for cultivation. From Dayu World to Snow Dojo, based on the speed my spaceship is traveling, we will arrive in ten years time. In such a short period of time, he didn’t give up cultivation. He’s really…” Wu Cang shook his head.

However, what Wu Cang didn’t know was that while ten years was a short time to himself, Jian Wushuang could improve his power significantly in ten years. Especially considering the fact that he had just completely resolved the Little Scattered Stars Game, meaning that there were many accumulated Sword Principles waiting to be digested.

A green spaceship was moving very quickly but suddenly… A conscience abruptly swept over it.

Wu Cang’s facial expression changed and he bellowed directly, “Whoever you are, move out of my way!”

His bellow spread through the cabin and echoed in the surrounding void.

Many figures were floating hundreds of thousand miles away from the green spaceship. The moment they heard Wu Cang bellow, the figures were shocked.

“It’s a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Hurry up and leave!”

Without hesitation, the figures immediately ran away.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang was awakened by Wu Cang’s bellow too. He couldn’t help but look over, “Lord Wu Cang, what’s going on?”

“Nothing, only some narrow-minded thieves,” Wu Cang smiled in disdain.

“Thieves? Bandits?” Jian Wushuang looked shocked.

He also knew that there were some bandits wandering in the dark void. Those bandits specialized in killing experts that passed by, and carried out a deal that couldn’t be exposed. As the dark void was really too huge, Snow Kingdom couldn’t do anything about the bandits either.

Those experts from the world were mostly very careful. In a normal situation, no one dared to wander around the dark void recklessly if they didn’t possess a level of power.

Of course, as a Universe God in the Third Heaven who was considered the top expert even in Snow Kingdom, he could totally run freely in the dark void. Almost no bandits dared to provoke him.

“Jian Wushuang, the bandits you ran into in Snow Kingdom were just child’s play. The scariest place with real bandits is the boundless void near the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. That is the place with the most reckless bandits, with the craziest massacres and countless experts’ nightmare. Many experts from various Kingdoms and Worlds died in the boundless void on their way to the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.”

“You are going to Lineage of Star and you will definitely pass by the boundless void. To you, it would also be a challenge. It is also because the boundless void is very dangerous, that’s why I wanted you to become stronger before going there,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“The boundless void?” Jian Wushuang memorized the name. He turned around and looked at Wu Cang, “Lord Wu Cang, if you were you come across bandits again, don’t chase them away in a hurry. Let them be my lab rats.”

“Lab rats?” Wu Cang looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Previously when I resolved the Little Scattered Stars Game, I came to a realization about Sword Principles. I have been figuring out ways to create stronger Sword Principles. Actually, I am really in need of someone to train with me,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Oh, I see,” Wu Cang smiled, “If so, alright. However, try not to delay too much.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t take long,” Jian Wushuang smiled.
