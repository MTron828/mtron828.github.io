Chapter 2957: Earth, Boom!

——

Clang! Clang! Bang! Bang!

The sounds of head-on collisions and clashes rang out continuously.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang had already engaged in a head-on battle with the Star Sea Saint.

In terms of offensive power, the Star Sea Saint was indeed slightly stronger than Jian Wushuang. Moreover, his comprehension of the rules of the Earth was also extremely high, making him extremely strong in defense, attack, and defense. His speed was also not bad, and he had almost no weaknesses.

Although Jian Wushuang had perfectly combined his swordsmanship with the reincarnation sword formation to unleash the ultimate power, he still had the upper hand in a fight with Star Sea Saint.

However, Star Sea Saint obviously could not do anything to Jian Wushuang in a short time.

Not far from the battlefield, Xue Dong King was already stunned.

“Star Sea Saint Lord is the acknowledged number one expert in this territory, Star Sea Saint Lord!”

“His divine power is extremely powerful, his comprehension of the rules of the Earth is extremely high, and his absolute arts are even more powerful… too powerful. Star Sea Saint Master is really too powerful!”

“However… Star Sea Saint Master is so powerful, but how could the Heavenly Sword Marquis fight him head-on?”

Xue Dong King was shocked.

Although he knew that Jian Wushuang was not weak, he thought that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was equal to his, or even less than his.

But the result?

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had completely overturned his understanding.

“To be able to defeat Star Sea Saint Master, who is at the peak of the first rank True Saint realm, the Heavenly Sword Marquis must have the battle strength of the first rank True Saint realm. Even among the first rank True Saints, they must be extremely powerful. But he is only a Divine Master?” Xue Dong King could not help muttering.

Yes, a Divine Master!

Because Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, he was so shocked when Jian Wushuang displayed such battle strength.

After all, he had never heard of a Divine Master who could have the battle strength of a True Saint!

In the center of the battlefield.

The Star Sea Saint was full of surprise and shock at Jian Wushuang’s strength.

But soon, his eyes were filled with anger.

“Be careful. I admit that you are indeed a great genius. At least, I have never heard of a Divine Master who is more powerful than you. But no matter how powerful you are, you will die if you dare to block my way!”

The cold voice of the Star Sea Saint reverberated across the entire world.

At this moment, the Star Sea Saint had already raised the giant hammer in his hand once again.

Buzz buzz buzz!

Endless earthen yellow energy, which was also the power of the laws of the Earth, surged out crazily and condensed toward the giant hammer in his hand at an incomparably terrifying speed.

A layer of earthen yellow earth battle armor appeared on the surface of the Star Sea Saint’s body. His figure also became more towering, and his aura became more tyrannical.

As for the giant hammer in his hand, it began to enlarge infinitely.

“Earth, collapse!”

The Star Sea Saint’s eyes flashed.

Swish!

It was like a flash of light.

The giant hammer was raised high by the Star Sea Saint and was still a long distance away from Jian Wushuang. However, in an instant, the giant hammer appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, giving him no time to resist or resist, the giant hammer had already smashed into his divine body.

“How can it be so fast?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also filled with shock.

He could see that the Star Sea Saint was preparing to use his ultimate move. However, he did not expect that the Star Sea Saint’s move would be so fast that he did not have time to dodge.

The giant hammer smashed fiercely. The terrifying power contained in it shattered the nine luminaries star armor on the surface of his body at the first moment. Then, the power passed through the golden armor and entered his body, wantonly moving around inside his body.

Jian Wushuang’s body was also smashed by the hammer and fell to the ground. A huge pit appeared on the ground.

At the bottom of the pit, the power of the giant hammer had been completely exhausted. However, Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief.

“Fortunately, although my divine body has been damaged by more than 70%, it didn’t directly collapse. I don’t need to replenish my divine body,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The collapse of his divine body was not terrible. He could use his divine power to rebuild his divine body immediately.

However, he was only a Divine Master, but he could use his divine power to rebuild his divine body. It was obvious that he had an immortal body.

There were not many Divine Masters who had an immortal body in the Divine Beginning World. This was the endless territory. Once the news spread out, the three Saint realm experts who were still in the Golden Crow Nine Realms and had not left would immediately determine his identity, this was not good for Jian Wushuang.

His divine power had only been damaged, so he did not need to replenish it. He just needed to use his divine power to repair it.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang’s divine body had been completely repaired.

Whoosh!

He immediately rushed up again and appeared in the void above. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing Jian Wushuang rise up from the huge pit below unharmed, even the Star Sea Saint was a little surprised.

“How is this possible?”

“He was not injured by my most powerful move? His aura was not weakened at all?”

The Star Sea Saint was full of disbelief.

Xue Dong King, who was watching the battle from outside the battlefield, was also stunned.

If it had been him, he would have died, but Jian Wushuang was not injured at all?

“You are indeed the number one expert in this territory, the Star Sea Saint. You are indeed very strong, but unfortunately, although you are a little stronger than me, you can’t do anything to me. It is difficult for you to even suppress me, let alone kill me. How can you compete with me for the Divine Earth Fruit under such circumstances?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“When the Divine Earth Fruit ripens, I’ll only have to tie you down and let Xue Dong King pick it. You can only watch.”

Saint Star Sea’s expression changed.

Indeed, judging from the strength displayed by both sides, he could not do anything to Jian Wushuang.

He had even used his strongest move, but he could not hurt Jian Wushuang. How could he kill him?

What Jian Wushuang said was true. As long as he was entangled, Xue Dong King would be able to pick the Divine Earth Fruit with ease.

“Boy, what’s your name?” Star Sea Saint looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, although you are only a Divine Master, your strength is indeed impressive. You are the first person below the True Saint realm to take my strongest move head-on, and you are only a Divine Master. However, if you think that you can easily get the Divine Earth Fruit by entangling me, you are dreaming.” Star Sea Saint smiled coldly.
