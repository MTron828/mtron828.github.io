Zi Dongwang escaped straight away.

Although he was seriously injured, he still had the strength to escape. In an instant, he had completely disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s line of vision.

When Xin Zhu witnessed such a scene, he was completely stunned at his position.

“How is this possible?” Xin Zhu’s eyes was filled with dullness, “The proud and ambitious Zi Dongwang has actually run away?”

He found it unbelievable.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang looked at him.

Xin Zhu felt fearful.

Since Zi Dongwang had escaped, what was going to happen to him?

“Run!” Xin Zhu did not hesitate and he chose to escape at once.

“Hmph, you have brought me inconvenience twice and yet you wish to leave without paying the price for it?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. Although he was quite a distance away, he still used the same move. With the aid of the God Destroying Lance, a light beam was shot and it entered Xin Zhu from the back of his body.

When Zi Dongwang had been struck by this Soul Attack previously, he had ended up in a very tragic state and Jian Wushuang had taken advantage of the opportunity to wound him fatally.

However, as Xin Zhu was proficient in Soul Attacks to begin with, his consciousness defense was stronger than Zi Dongwang.

After taking Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack, Xin Zhu’s body paused and his expression turned pale. However, he managed to withstand the attack and he disappeared from in front of Jian Wushuang quickly.

Jian Wushuang had a cold expression. Even though he looked on as Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu left one after the other, he did not give chase. Instead, he looked toward a distant battlefield.

On that battlefield, Duan Lingfeng was still fighting the God Destroying King.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body moved and he appeared on the battlefield in a split second.

When he arrived at the battlefield for real, he could not help but gasp in surprise as he looked at the battlefield.

The big battlefield covered tens of thousands of miles. However, the ground below the battlefield had completely disappeared. What was left behind was a bottomless pit with a large circumference, as well as giant, boundless saber markings. Even the void was utterly dilapidated by the two frightening Divine Powers and looked as if it were the end of the world. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Bam!

A violent sound of collision could be heard from a part of the battlefield. Strong wind was also created from the power generated from the clash between the both of them and it swept past the area. Jian Wushuang was hit by the strong wind and this caused his hair and robe to be blown up.

“This is really intense,” Jian Wushuang stuck out his tongue and licked his lips. His eyes were glowing brilliantly.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Two shadows finally separated from one another again and the battlefield regained its peace for once.

Jian Wushuang then looked toward the both of them, starting with Duan Lingfeng.

The Duan Lingfeng of the very moment did not have his unyielding attitude and he even looked a bit miserable. In addition, the corners of his mouth and his body had a few bloodstains. Even if this were the case, Duan Lingfeng’s fighting spirit did not become any weaker.

As for the God Destroying King, he remained powerful and unrivalled.

“Seems like Duan Lingfeng is the one in a slightly disadvantageous position. The first of the Universe God ranking list really lives up to his reputation,” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

In the void, the God Destroying King wore a nonchalant smile and the intimidating golden long spear in his hands pointed toward Duan Lingfeng, “To be able to force me to this stage, you are indeed strong. However, if you wish to fight for my position, you are still not good enough.”

Duan Lingfeng’s expression turned grave.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared beside Duan Lingfeng.

“Duan Lingfeng, this is the first time I have seen you in such a miserable state,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

Duan Lingfeng glanced at Jian Wushuang and nodded his head, “Can’t help it. This God Destroying King is really powerful. He is more powerful than any of the Universe Gods that I have met as well as a few of the Real Gods. I have already done my best. However, I was still pushed back by him easily.”

“Pushed back easily?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted.

The word ‘easy’ could mean that the God Destroying King had not shown his true power yet.

The God Destroying King, who was in a distant void, also noticed Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

“Jian Wushuang? What about Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu?” the God Destroying King questioned with a deep voice.

He had been fighting with Duan Lingfeng all the way and he could not pay attention to the other battlefield.

“The both of them ran away a long time ago,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“Ran away?” God Destroying King’s expression changed slightly, “Zi Dongwang is known as the second of the Universe God ranking list. Even with Xin Zhu, they are still unable to do anything to you. To make matters worse, they even had to escape from you? What trash!”

“Since the both of them have escaped, why aren’t you leaving as well? Could it be that you want the both of us to send you off personally?” Jian Wushuang stared at the God Destroying King.

“I, the God Destroying King, can come and go anytime I want. Since when is it up to other people to decide for me?” the God Destroying King bellowed coldly.

“Seems like we really will have to send you off,” Jian Wushuang chuckled and looked toward Duan Lingfeng who was beside him, “Let’s team up and fight the God Destroying King. Deal?”

“Two against one?” After muttering to himself for some time, Duan Lingfeng nodded his head, “No problem.”

Duan Lingfeng was also certain that it would be very difficult for him to fight against the God Destroying King alone. Hence, it would be impossible to force the God Destroying King to leave.

Therefore, both of them had no choice but to team up.

“Comparing attack power, I am inferior to you. However, your martial art motion and speed are inferior to mine. Hence, I will fight with him in close combat and you will take advantage of any openings to put pressure on him!”

“With the both of us teaming up, we can teach this God Destroying King a lesson,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Alright,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head earnestly.

Immediately… Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang unleashed his martial art motion and eighteen shadows swept past the area. In no time, they appeared beside the God Destroying King and did not give him any time to use his Sword Principles.

Buzz!

An icy-cold golden light appeared abruptly. It was a golden long spear.

The golden long spear was like a golden giant dragon and it materialized in the void that Jian Wushuang’s body had appeared from with lightning speed. A frightening destructive aura was also released at the same time.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang only felt that he, as well as the void that he came out of, were about to be completely annihilated.

“What fast reactions!”

Jian Wushuang was surprised. With a change of his body again, he bypassed the intimidating golden long spear. After that, his body changed into a sharp sword and the golden Divine Ape which shrouded his body also held the longsword in its hand tightly. Sword light then whistled.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Rustle! A great amount of sword light burst forth abruptly.

However, the God Destroying King’s eyes were filled with a layer of coldness. The golden long spear in his hands swept across the area in an intimidating manner which could destroy the world.

The numerous Sword Principles that Jian Wushuang attacked with were all dissipated without exception, and even he himself was forced to retreat.

“The fifteenth!”

In the void, fifteen crimson saber shadows appeared abruptly. They were superimposed onto one another and released.

“Hmph!”

The God Destroying King bellowed coldly and he simply extended his terrifying golden long spear forward.

Boom!

All of a sudden, the thousands of miles of void in front of him exploded and collapsed. As for the giant crimson saber light that was within the void, it dissipated instantly.
