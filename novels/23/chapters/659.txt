Chapter 660: Numerous Geniuses

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The three sword scars looked exactly the same, and even the nine sword movements were all the same. However, Jian Wushuang realized that every one of the three sword scars had its Occult level. The reason why he couldn’t figure it out was that he only saw three similar sword scars, but the truth was that his cultivation in Sword Principle was not extensive enough.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi has created a real challenge. There are so many disciples of Sword Principle in the Ancient Sect, but it seems true that none of them have been able to fully comprehend the three sword scars. I?wonder, will I be able to comprehend the three sword scars with my talent in Sword Principle?” Jian Wushuang clasped both his hands with a sense of expectation.

After scanning the three sword scars, Jian Wushuang did not stay here. Instead, he went on a walk around the Sword Pavilion.

In the Sword Pavilion, he did see a lot of experiences and some Secret Skills that were left behind by experts of Sword Principle.

However, Jian Wushuang wasn’t qualified to directly acquire these experiences and Secret Skills. If he wanted to meditate on them, he had to send an application to the seniors of the Ancient Sect. For now, he was nothing more than a disciple, someone who didn’t even have the eligibility to send in an application, so he had to be apprenticed to an expert who was able to help him with the application.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi was right. All the disciples of the Ancient Sect become apprenticed to an expert so that they can gain access to more resources.”

Jian Wushuang pondered and, before long, left the Sword Palace.

Back at Enlightenment Mountain, Jian Wushuang found a deserted cave mansion and met Feng and Huo Ying.

In front of them, on the stone table, was a good wine that had been brought by Huo Ying from his hometown. Currently, the three people were drinking with each other.

“When I was still in the Ancient World, I used to daydream about what the Sects in the Eternal World would look like. However, I didn’t know what the Sects really looked like until I came to the Ancient Sect. The Dao Palace is amazing!” said Huo Ying.

“It’s so amazing to see so many experts gathered there to explore the Dao. Each of the thirteen Palace Masters has an enormously profound understanding of the Dao and they never hesitate to pass on their experience to others. It’s no wonder such a Sect can develop such strong disciples,” Feng said approvingly.

Both of them visited the Dao Palace, where they were shocked by what they saw.

“There are a good many geniuses in the Ancient Sect, let alone experts. They all have a profound comprehension of the Dao. Compared to those disciples in the Ancient Sect, we can only find ourselves at the very bottom of the list. I’m afraid the three of us will lose the qualification to be an inner disciple at the Sect Competition in two years,” Huo Ying said.

After they heard that, a wry smile played across Feng’s lips while Jian Wushuang gave a shrug.

In the Ancient Sect, only those who have been there for less than 500 years could still be a disciple. But there was still a tremendous number of disciples, even if many of them were outer disciples. However, many outer disciples were more gifted than inner disciples and had an extremely high level of understanding on the Dao.

Looking at the outer disciples that were currently in the Ancient Sect, even the weakest had fully comprehended the first Occult while the slightly stronger disciples had fully comprehended two different Occults. Gong Chao, who ranked first at Firmament Territory Feast, had only comprehended two Occults.

As for those who stood at the top among the outer disciples, there were more than ten geniuses that had already grasped three different Occults.

With their current strength, even the strongest one, Jian Wushuang, wouldn’t even be ranked in the middle of these outer disciples.

Once the Sect Competition began in two years, the weakest inner disciples would be challenged by those outer disciples. If they failed, they would be downgraded to outer disciples and they would no longer be able to stay at Enlightenment Mountain.

“We didn’t have an appropriate condition for cultivation when we were in the Ancient World, so we made little progress. Now that we have arrived at the Ancient Sect, where we will be provided with so many cultivation resources, we can make much better progress than before. Not to mention that we still have two years to put up a good fight,” Feng gripped both of his hands tightly, with a wild gleam in his eyes as he continued in a low voice. “Even though I may be downgraded to an outer disciple two years from now, I won’t regret it as long as I know I tried.”

“Exactly.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and said solemnly, “Palace Master Xuan Yi said the first two years in the Ancient Sect would be the best time to make breakthroughs for disciples like us who just joined the Ancient Sect, especially inner disciples. As long as we try hard, our strength should be able to reach a brand new level, so we still have a little hope for the Sect Competition in two years.”

“Well, Let’s toast to the three of us still being able to drink at Enlightenment Mountain in two years.” Huo Ying raised his glass and smiled.

“Cheers!”

Both Jian Wushuang and Feng raised their glasses. The three of them were selected as candidates to join the Ancient Sect during the Firmament Territory Feast and they were all inner disciples, so it was only natural that they stuck together. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After drinking a cup of wine, Feng pursed his lips and said, “Since we have just joined the Ancient Sect, we need to find a suitable expert and become apprenticed to him. Under his personal guidance and with the many cultivation resources of the Ancient Sect, our strength should grow by leaps and bounds. Earlier today, I went to Dao Palace and found a suitable expert, so I will go visit him tomorrow.”

“I also have a suitable candidate who is a Palace Master, but I have no idea whether or not he would be willing to accept me. Anyway, I will have a try,” Huo Ying said and smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you think?” Both Feng and Huo Ying looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I... I’m in no hurry. After all, I have not been to the Dao Palace yet,” Jian Wushuang said, then smiled briefly.

“Your talent is so incredible! I suppose those Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters would scramble to accept you as their disciple, so you don’t really need to visit them personally,” Huo Ying said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help laughing.

While the three of them were busy drinking together, Xuan Yi was sending the information on Jian Wushuang, Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang, as well as their performance at the Firmament Territory Feast, to those Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters in the Dao Palace.

These Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters just scanned it briefly. They appeared unimpressed by the first five candidates, but when they saw Jian Wushuang’s information, they were all astounded.

“How can he be so powerful with a cultivation age less than 40 years in a place like the Ancient World?”

“Even in the Eternal World, it’s unbelievable to reach that level in less than 40 years, not to mention that he came from the Ancient World.”

“What an exceptional genius! Unfortunately, he is good at Sword Principle and meditates on the World Dao and the Slaughter Dao, which are not my strong points.”
