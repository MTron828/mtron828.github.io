Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Elder Host, you’ve worked hard!” Wang Yuanwai was a middle-aged man well into his fifties. Due to never having engaged in physical labor, he carried himself with elegance, his skin even fairer than many young women’s.

After exchanging pleasantries, the two of them proceeded to the backyard together, preparing to welcome the new bride.

There was no one else around at this moment. Wang Yuanwai and the chubby monk revealed their true intentions.

“Elder Host, can this little girl truly dispel the calamity that afflicts me?” Wang Yuanwai swayed his hefty frame, asking in a low voice.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Wang Yuanwai, rest assured. As long as this girl marries into your Wang family and becomes your concubine, she will undoubtedly rid you of the chronic ailment plaguing you!” The chubby monk spoke earnestly and resolutely.

“Good, with your assurance, I can rest easy. I’ve already had the betrothal gifts delivered to the side chamber as agreed upon. We are now even.”

Upon hearing this, the chubby monks face lit up with joy. He hurriedly replied, “Excellent!”

Having escorted Wang Yuanwai to the entrance of the backyard, the chubby monk quickly made his way to the side chamber in the front yard.

The bridal procession went smoothly. After settling the new bride in the sedan chair, Wang Yuanwai headed to a carriage in the front.

Li Yushan, waiting outside the temple, saw the bridal procession depart. This time, he didn’t hesitate. He directly stood in the road, blocking the descending procession.

“Why aren’t we moving yet?” Wang Yuanwai lifted the curtain beside him and looked at the servant next to him.

“Reporting to Master, someone ahead is blocking the way!’

On days of great joy, there were often people blocking the road, demanding celebratory money. Wang Yuanwai was familiar with this; he had married numerous concubines in his earlier years, encountering such situations each time.

If in the past, throwing a few taels of silver wouldn’t have bothered him, but this time, he had spent a large sum of money just to marry a blonde girl.

“Get him out of here!” Mr. Wangs face turned warm with anger. However, when he realized they were outside the temple, he reluctantly waved his hand, sighed, and said, “Forget it, give him a tael of silver, and make him leave quickly!’

The servants bowed repeatedly, acknowledging his order.

“Today is the joyous day for our master. Here, take this money and get lost!” A servant impatiently tossed the money on the ground.

Li Yushan’s expression remained resolute. “l don’t want money!”

“Don’t want money?” The servant glanced him up and down, sneering, “What, you don’t want money, you want something else?”

Other servants heard this and burst into laughter, rolling up their sleeves and cracking their knuckles, ready to shove this little guy aside at any moment.

“Yes, I want something else!” Li Yushan replied calmly.

Upon hearing this, the smile faded from the servant’s face, replaced by a cold, icy expression.

Other servants gathered around!

This was a problem that couldn’t be solved with a mere beating.

Three or five wicked servants moved in to attack!

Fortunately, Li Yushan wasn’t defenseless. Although he had never been in a fight, he used the techniques his master had taught him and easily knocked these people down with a few punches and kicks.

After brushing off the footprints on his clothes, Li Yushan walked toward the sedan chair carrying the bride. His eyes, once resolute, softened as if he had returned to that summer day when he first met Red Girl in the vegetable garden.

“Red Girl,” Li Yushan murmured softly.

The servants carrying the sedan chair placed it down and quickly stepped back, having witnessed Li Yushan!s skills just moments ago.

Li Yushan walked slowly to the front of the sedan chair, lifted the curtain, and when he saw the bride sitting inside, his heart raced.

When countless words hung on his lips, he didn’t know where to start.

“Come with me!” Li Yushan finally uttered the answer from his heart.

The new bride, sitting in the sedan chair, was momentarily confused. “Are we there already?” she asked.

Upon hearing this, the young Daoist priest was taken aback.

This wasn’t Red Girl’s voice.

He found it hard to believe, so he swiftly pulled off the bride’s red veil, only to see a stranger’s face.

“Ah!” the new bride screamed in shock!

Li Yushan grabbed the red veil and quickly stepped back. At this moment, his heart was filled with both astonishment and joy.

Meanwhile, Wang Yuanwai, who had struggled down from the carriage, glared fiercely with his eyes and shouted, “Kid, how dare you intercept my people! Do you know who I am?”

Li Yushan dropped the red veil, hastily apologized, and rushed into the temple, his face lit up with joy.

Wang Yuanwai, bewildered, couldn’t make sense of the situation. Several servants hesitantly approached him, bowing their heads and not daring to speak.

“Hmph!” Wang Yuanwai snorted. “Go back for now. We’ll deal with him after today!’

“Yes, yes!”

The bridal procession set off once more, descending the mountain.

Meanwhile, Li Yushan headed straight for the temple’s backyard, finding the vegetable garden and rushing toward the place where Red Girl stayed.

“Red Girl!” Li Yushan shouted loudly.

But after searching around, he couldn’t find any trace of Red Girl.

Then he remembered, Red Girl had said that his father was a monk in the temple. Even before he could approach the monks for inquiries, several abbots blocked his way with sticks.

“Which one of you is Red Girl’s father?” Li Yushan asked cautiously.

He knew that the last time the Daoist temple was vandalized, it was because he had taken Red Girl down the mountain. Red Girl’s father wanted the two of them to meet.

“l am!” one of the abbots made way, and a fat monk appeared, glaring at Li Yushan with a stern expression.

“Where is Red Girl?”

“She’s married!”

“Impossible, I saw her, she’s not Red Girl!” Li Yushan shook his head.

The fat monk shouted angrily, “She is Red Girl!”

“Throw him out!”

Several abbots with hostile looks approached Li Yushan, brandishing long sticks.

These abbots were not servants, or rather, they weren’t real abbots at all!

The fat monk and his gang were not genuine monks.

The fat monk, who had just attempted to leave, hadn’t anticipated the young Taoist’s skill. He had effortlessly dealt with several abbots in an instant.

However, seeing the injuries on him, the fat monk understood; it was an exchange of wounds.

“Kid, before I lose my temper, you better leave now!”

“Where is Red Girl?” Li Yushan sensed something was amiss; all he wanted now was to see Red Girl.

“She’s dead!” the fat monk said with a smile. “Are you satisfied with this answer?”

Li Yushan’s pupils contracted, panic filling him. “It’s impossible!”

“Don’t believe me?” the fat monk was now amused, looking at the infatuated young Taoist. He continued, “I’ll tell you the truth. She died a month ago, right in the well behind you.”

“This can’t be!” Li Yushan hastily turned and ran toward the well.

At this moment, the fat monk suddenly attacked. Despite his bulky frame, his movements were swift and agile, not weaker than Li Yushan’s at all.

Just as Li Yushan reached the edge of the well, he was kicked several yards away. However, he hardly felt the pain. He struggled to get up, moving until he saw the well, still as clear as it had always been. Only then did he feel some relief.

“Kid, go down and join her!” The fat monk grabbed his neck and pushed him toward the well..
