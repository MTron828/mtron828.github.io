Chapter 140: Death

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Situ Qingyue’s head flew high into the air with his eyes wide in disbelief.

He didn’t know. Although Jian Wushuang was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm, his real strength was much more terrifying. In Clearwater Stronghold, he fought with two purple-masked assassins at the same time and killed one directly.

Although he was not in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, he was more powerful than a normal warrior in that realm. How could the cage trap him?

“Master!”

“Master!”

Seeing Situ Qingyue’s head flying in the air, all the Situ family warriors in the area were greatly frightened and no one dared to step forward.

After turning around, Jian Wushuang walked into the cage. He chopped the pillars of the cage with his sword and appeared before Ji Wuyue.

“Auntie,” Jian Wushuang’s voice trembled.

Ji Wuyue was just absent-mindedly sitting there. Until she heard Jian Wushuang calling her, after which her eyes shone lightly.

“You are...Wushuang?” Ji Wuyue asked with a deep and husky voice.

“Yes, it’s me,” Jian Wushuang nodded vigorously and said, “Auntie, I’m here to take you away.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang directly held her in his arms and walked out.

At the exit of the secret chamber, there were so many warriors from the Situ family blocking the door.

“Anyone who stands in my way will die!” Jian Wushuang shouted in a cold voice and glanced around with killing intent.

All the warriors in the Situ family were so frightened that they all moved back out of the way, making way for them.

Jian Wushuang took Ji Wuyue out from the Situ family, and then they sat on the Griffin waiting outside and flew away.

...

Half a day later, Jian Wushuang was back in the cave again, along with Ji Wuyue. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

An Ying was still lying on the ground in the cave. His crazy yell had died down because of his hoarse throat. However, his contorted face and crazy eyes showed that he was suffering a lot.

Jian Wushuang carefully let Ji Wuyue recline on the cave’s wall, and then he walked toward An Ying.

“Give me the antidote.” Jian Wushuang shouted coldly with a commanding tone.

An Ying forcefully raised his head, glancing at Jian Wushuang and Ji Wuyue, then he sneered and said, “Jian Wushuang, you want to save her now? Haha, absurd, ridiculous!”

“The Heart-biting Poison had spread through her whole body. She can’t survive much longer. I don’t have any antidote, even if I did and gave it to you, it will not work anymore.”

“You have belittled the Heart-biting Poison too much. Haha...”

An Ying laughed wantonly.

Pia!

Jian Wushuang slapped him on his face and said, “Bastard!”

“Wushuang.” Ji Wuyue’s deep and husky voice sounded.

“Auntie.” Jian Wushuang hurriedly walked toward Ji Wuyue and squatted down in front of her.

“I clearly understand my body. It’s true that I only have a few days to live and that no one can save me,” Ji Wuyue said with a smile, “I have no regrets now that I have had a chance to see you and the old bastard again before I die.”

“Wushuang, give me a knife.”

“Hum?” Jian Wushuang was in a trance.

“I want to kill him myself.” Ji Wuyue’s voice trembled, looking at An Ying with resentful and cruel eyes.

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then he took a dagger out from his interspatial ring and gave it to Ji Wuyue.

Ji Wuyue strugglingly came to An Ying and turned his body over so that he was facing up.

“Haha, Ji Wuyue. How about the Heart-biting Poison?” An Ying looked at Ji Wuyue with a grim smile.

Ji Wuyue didn’t answer him. But she slowly stabbed the dagger into his thigh rather than the vital organs.

“Hahaha...come on, kill me, torture me!”

“What was the torture I suffered in comparison with what you suffered these years?”

“Ji Wuyue, you are so miserable. You were an Extraordinary beauty who was second only to your sister, Ji Wumeng, in Ji Clan. So many experts once succumbed to your charm. But now, look at you, a ghostly image.”

“Miserable, such a miserable person.”

An Ying growled crazily. Ji Wuyue didn’t say anything, just continuing to stab the dagger into his body again and again.

One by one...she had stabbed him for more than 50 times in succession.

At this moment, An Ying’s voice was faint and nearly breathless. Then Ji Wuyue raised the dagger in her hand and brutally stabbed it into his heart at his last breath.

An Ying died at once!

After killing An Ying with her own hands, Ji Wuyue’s whole body was trembling, but there was also delight showing in her eyes.

Jian Wushuang coldly watched what she did. But he felt ashamed and guilty when facing his auntie, Ji Wuyue.

“Wushuang.” Ji Wuyue suddenly turned.

“Auntie.” Jian Wushuang raised his head.

SHUA!

Her blood spilled on Jian Wushuang’s face and he was completely stunned.

Seeing Ji Wuyue stabbing the dagger into her own heart.

Although Ji Wuyue spat blood out, she wore a smile on her face. “After suffering so many years, it’s time to get rid of it.”

“Wushuang...”

“Don’t forget the blood debt of the Ji Clan. But now you are not strong enough and you’d better not fight against Blood Feather Tower face-to-face.”

“What’s more, I saw your father. Though it was three years ago, he... is alive.”

Once she finished saying that, Ji Wuyue gave Jian Wushuang one last look and then she slowly fell down.

Stunned, Jian Wushuang stood there, rooted on the ground. He recovered himself a long time later and looked at his dead auntie.

“Ah!”

A roar with unprecedented killing intent flew to the Ninth Heaven at this moment!

Rumble... Even the Void thundered as if it was echoing his angry roar!

After a good while, everything finally quieted down.

The thunder stopped, and the heavy rain which lasted a whole day and night stopped as well.

On an unknown hill, Jian Wushuang knelt in front of a nameless gravestone. Holding his hands closely and looking at the gravestone, he kotowed three times heavily.

“Auntie, rest in peace!”

“I swear I will collect the blood debt for our Ji Clan.”

Jian Wushuang said in a calm tone, but he was much more persistent and determined than ever before.

“Blood Feather Tower... everything was caused by Blood Feather Tower.” Jian Wushuang’s face was ice-cold.

“But Auntie is right. I am not strong enough, I’m far from being strong enough!”

“Though I can bring some loss to Blood Feather Tower, I cannot turn it upside down. There is still a long way to go before I can uproot them.”

“I, have to try my best to improve my strength!”

Jian Wushuang had a strong desire for strength.

Staying in Sword Tomb for two years, he had improved a lot and could even kill normal purple-masked assassins. However, his strength was far from what was needed to uproot Blood Feather Tower.

“It’s better to go back to Dragon Palace first.”

Jian Wushuang set off right away.
