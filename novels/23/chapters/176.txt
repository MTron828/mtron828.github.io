Chapter 177: Attack and Kill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

Like a roaring dragon, the sword light rushed towards the warrior of Initial Yin Void Realm.

There was a significant change in the warrior’s expression as he hurried to block the attack.

Jian Wushuang had been capable of killing Ouyang Haotian who had ranked third on the Earthly Dragon List with a single sword move. His real battle strength was even comparable to that of the experts of the Exceptional Yin Void Realm. Thus, a surprise attack against a warrior of the Initial Yin Void Realm was rather easy for him.

Naturally, the outcome would not deviate from expectations.

The sword light easily penetrated the body of the Initial Yin Void Realm and killed him instantly.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several dramatic roars sounded successively and Qu Nan and other experts of the Nine Emperors Sect were beaten back.

Qu Nan was thrown heavily against the wall, smashing it to pieces. A mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth.

As for the other experts of the Yin Void from the Nine Emperors Sect, one was killed by Jian Wushuang, while another warrior of the Initial Yin Void Realm was killed by Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou. Another two warriors of the Profound Yin Void Realm were badly, but not fatally, injured.

Among the five experts of the Yin Void Realm from the Nine Emperors Sect, two were dead while three were heavily hurt in this sneak attack.

“You are so powerful.” The Golden Dragon Ambassadors looked at Jian Wushuang’s trio.

Jian Wushuang gave a small smile. He knew that although these Golden Dragon Ambassadors had not killed any of the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect, it did not mean they were useless.

After all, the stronger the warriors was, the harder it would be to kill them.

It was easy to kill ordinary experts of the Initial Yin Void Realm, but it would be rather difficult to kill them after they reached the Profound Yin Void Realm.

“Go on,” Jian Wushuang groaned, and then immediately headed towards the oncoming experts of the Nine Emperors Sect.

This group of experts were mostly at the Primordial Gold Core Realm. Although their strength was ordinary, there was a great number of them.

In order to save his father, Jian Wushuang would not show any pity to these experts, let alone show any mercy.

“Kill!”

Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, and the Golden Dragon Ambassadors also rushed out.

“You guys...” Qu Nan was struggling to stand up. On seeing the scene in front of him, his face turned grim.

“Ha-ha, Sect Master Qu, I’m sorry. Once entrusted by others, we will be loyal to them.” One of the Golden Dragon Ambassadors of the Exceptional Yin Void Realm laughed and came directly to Qu Nan.

Qu Nan reacted immediately.

However, as he was seriously injured from the sneak attack, he was severely disadvantaged and could only resist the Golden Dragon Ambassador’s attacks with great effort.

The other Golden Dragon Ambassador and Jian Wushuang’s team were attacking with ease, almost like tigers running into a flock of sheep.

For a moment, blood mist was suspended in the air and stained the horizon.

A fierce battle had already broken out.

Several brutal and dreadful breaths had rushed towards the sky. The breaths and spiritual power released from the battle were naturally spreading to the courtyard near the mountain.

“What happened?” Ma Qinghai’s face changed suddenly. He levitated off the ground and looked in the direction of the battle. Seeing the fierce battle in front of him, he was shocked.

“Has a large number of experts broken into our the Nine Emperors Sect?” he said hurriedly, “changes are occurring in our sect. Changfeng, you just stay here, and don’t go anywhere.”

Then Ma Qinghai rushed to the fierce battle field at the fastest speed.

In the courtyard, Ma Changfeng also felt a terrible Spiritual Power Wave that was not far away, and his face changed.

“The Yin Void Realm, is there a group of experts of the Yin Void Realm who have come to the Nine Emperors Sect?”

“Nine Emperors Sect is the first-class Sect of the Tianzong dynasty. Who in the Tianzong dynasty would dare to kill our warriors here?” Ma Changfeng frowned.

As a first-class Sect, it had a deep foundation and had always been extremely strong.

Throughout the Tianzong dynasty, there were only seven top clans and three Hegemons that the Nine Emperors Sect were fearful of.

The Nine Emperors Sect had always been very humble and respectful to the top seven clans and the Three Hegemons. As the Nine Emperors Sect had never provoked them, these clans and hegemons would not look for any trouble in the Nine Emperors Sect for no reason.

“Nine Emperors Sect hasn’t provoked any strong enemies during this period, so we shouldn’t have been hit by other sects unless…”?Ma Changfeng thought of a possibility, and immediately looked at the white-haired man next to him.

“Old man, are these experts coming here for you?”

Glancing at Ma Changfeng, Jian Nantian did not answer him and kept drinking.

“Hum, they must come for you.” Ma Changfeng snorted coldly. “But unfortunately, they can’t save you. Not only do we have lots of experts in the Nine Emperors Sect, just this courtyard...

“This courtyard is a huge and impenetrable prison. From the moment that you were imprisoned here, it was destined that they can not save you.”

Hearing that, Jian Nantian’s gaze froze slightly, but he still said nothing.

The fierce battle had reached a key moment in the Nine Emperors Sect.

Numerous cold corpses were lying in a disorderly manner on the ground or on the roof. These bodies belonged to the warriors of the Gold Core Realm from the Nine Emperors Sect.

In terms of the battle formation, Jian Wushuang’s team was stronger than that of the Nine Emperors Sect.

The Nine Emperors Sect had lost two warriors of the Initial Yin Void Realm and two of the Profound Yin Void Realm. Qu Nan had also been seriously injured in the sneak attack.

Jian Wushuang’s side already had an advantage based on battle strength at the level of the Yin Void. As for the ordinary warriors of the Gold Core Realm, even if their numbers were huge, they could only buy a little time but not turn the tides of the battle.

However, at this moment…

“Hum!”

With a cold hum suddenly sounding through the Void, a black-clothed elder with a lean face appeared, emanating tyrannical aura.

“How dare you break into the Nine Emperors Sect and kill my warriors?”

There was rage in the black-clothed elder’s eyes, and his clothes and hair were flapping around even though there was no wind.

This man was the Upper Elder of the Nine Emperors Sect who had reached the Peak of the Yin Void Realm and had sequestered himself to practice all the time.

“Upper Elder!”

“Upper Elder has shown up.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Now that Upper Elder has shown up, this group of intruders means nothing. Kill them all!”

Seeing the arrival of the black-clothed elder, the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect immediately beamed with excitement.

But as soon as this black-clothed elder appeared, a loud laughter suddenly sounded. “Ha-ha, old man Mo, haven’t you died yet?”

A handsome middle-aged man appeared in front of the black-clothed elder and the same breath of the Peak of the Yin Void Realm was emanated, which was stronger than that of the black-clothed elder. Naturally, this man was Ye Rufeng who had hidden in the dark.

“Ye Rufeng?” The black-clothed elder’s face changed slightly. “Our Nine Emperors Sect hasn’t offended the Golden-dragon Palace.”

“Yes, you didn’t offend us, but this time we are on a mission entrusted by others,” Ye Rufeng said with a smile.

“Are you going to stop me?” The black-clothed elder shouted coldly.

“What do you think?” Ye Rufeng laughed. “Perhaps I may not be stronger than you in direct slaughter, but since I am here, don’t even think about taking action.”

“Try me!” The black-clothed elder stopped talking and took action.

Ye Rufeng reacted to his move with a smile.

Two experts of the Peak of the Yin Void Realm fought against each other in the void right above Nine Emperors Sect.

With the roaring aura, terrible power crashed together.
