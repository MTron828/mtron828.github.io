Chapter 2117 Entering the Heaven Repairing Palace

The Ancient Mystery Land had been activated multiple times from the First Era to the Second.Now, the Land remained permanently open.

A huge Ancient battlefield lay upon the Land. Huge crowds of experts came during the early days of the Eternal Chaotic World. But as the Green Fire World expanded with their own superior Ancient battlefields, not many people came back.

“I’ve heard of this Ancient Mystery Land multiple times, but this is the first time I’ve been here,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“This Land still holds many opportunities, but it’s nothing compared to the battlefields in your hometown,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Jian Wushuang smiled. Soon, both reached the Palace.

The Heaven Repairing Palace stood amongst piles of rubble. It looked like a dilapidated palace beyond repair, but there was more to it than met the eye.

Many experts were already waiting outside the Palace. In front stood East Royal Emperor, the other eleven experts, and more who were in charge of protecting the Palace along with the East Royal Emperor.

“Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master,” East Royal Emperor greeted them.

“Everyone’s here, East Royal?” Abysmal Saint Master asked.

“Yes, with the Sword Emperor’s arrival, we can begin to activate the Palace,” East Royal Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked towards the eleven people.

Among those were Emperor God Liu Guang and Jue Xian. Noticing Jian Wushuang’s gaze, they immediately bowed.

Jian Wushuang smiled, and noticed Qian Mingzi.

“Elder Qian, how are you?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Qian Mingzi was an expert under Purple Moon Emperor. They had once helped the Lineage of Stars against the three big alliances.

“You’re too kind, Sword Emperor,” Qian Mingzi respectfully replied.

Besides the trio, Jian Wushuang recognised another person. This young man wore a white robe, his hair white as snow, his gaze as cold.

“Emperor God Tian Ling?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Emperor God Tian Ling, co-founder of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, was the strongest expert within the Star Extermination Alliance, back when he fought at the Lineage of Stars.

His abilities were already pinnacle Emperor God at that time, and he was qualified to fight against the Underworld God.

After so many years, this Emperor God had yet to reach Great Emperor levels, but amongst Emperor Gods he was definitely the most qualified person for a seat in the Palace, with the highest chances of actually reaching Great Emperor.

Emperor God Tian Ling sensed Jian Wushuang looking at him. His emotions were conflicting.

Jian Wushuang back then had fought vigorously against him at the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they only decided to let down their grudges temporarily for the Three Emperors World battle. But the Jian Wushuang of today… he had grown so strong that he left Emperor God Tian Ling speechless.

At the same time, he was glad this battle was about to emerge. Without it, Jian Wushuang would have long ago made his move against the Soaring Heaven King Palace, and he would not be able to do anything about it.

“Regardless, I must reach Great Emperor levels after this. If not when Jian Wushuang comes after me, the Soaring Heaven King Palace will go down without a fight,” Emperor God Tian Ling clenched his fists. He was determined.

What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang no longer cared so much about his rivalry against the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

A small Soaring Heaven King Palace was no longer worth the time and effort needed to exact his revenge. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jian Wushuang’s biggest enemy now is the Three Emperors World. He could even put down his grudge against Abysmal Saint Master, and become good friends with him. As long as the Soaring Heaven King Palace did their best, he would not come after them.

Of course, if they were to make any sudden movements, he would not let it slide.

His gaze shifted to another person.

This person attracted Jian Wushuang more than anyone else.

His aura was the strongest amongst the Emperor Gods, even more than Emperor God Tian Ling.

Maybe as good as a normal Great Emperor.

“If I am not wrong, you are Underworld God?” Jian Wushuang asked the green-robed, normal-looking middle-aged man.

“Greetings, Sword Emperor,” the man bowed humbly, but without much fear.

“I see…” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Rumour has it that you are the only Emperor God around able to go against a Great Emperor, I guess they were right. In fact, you’re probably stronger than that. If I were to put you against a Great Emperor, you could probably handle it, right?”

Hearing this, the Underworld God smiled. He did not deny it.

But he still humbly replied, “The rumours are not true. I can indeed go against Great Emperors as an Emperor God, but I’m not the only one. With you Sword Master, the unbelievable Emperor God at that point of time, how could I claim this title alone?”

“Err..” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He took a few more glances at the Underworld God and Emperor God Tian Ling. The rest he did not care for as much.

“Since everyone is here, let us activate the Palace now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” East Royal Emperor nodded, and waved a few gestures towards the Palace.

A token was tossed into the Palace.

The dilapidated palace started to glow, and began its restoration to its former glory.

The doors soon opened.

“You all can enter now,” East Royal Emperor said.

“Please guard us well, both of you,” Jian Wushuang said and entered the palace first.

The other eleven Emperor Gods followed one by one.
