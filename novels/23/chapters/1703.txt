Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Although I was the one who got the White Blaze Fruit Tree, it is extremely useful to Lineage of Star. I can’t exchange a White Blaze Fruit Tree for an opportunity to enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “Sir God Luo Sha, is there no other possibility?”

“Another possibility? Yes,” Sir God Luo Sha suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, I read the information recorded on Real God ranking list. It is said that you once injured Sir God Qian Lan.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Sir God Qian Lan is an Almighty from Soaring Heaven King Palace. Why would he fight with you?” Sir God Luo Sha asked.

“It was because, when I was wandering in the Eighth Lair, I killed one expert after another from Soaring Heaven King Palace…” Jian Wushuang briefly shared his story of the Eighth Lair.

Actually, many experts in Eternal Chaotic World knew about the story. However, as Sir God Luo Sha was secluded from the outside world, she never heard about it.

He finished the story. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“In other words, Soaring Heaven King Palace suffered a great loss because of you?” Sir God Luo Sha’s eyes squinted.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“I knew about this as well,” Sir God Mad Dog spoke, “Soaring Heaven King Palace has been barbaric and they never once suffered. But this time, not only did they suffer a great loss, they were embarrassed. They even became a laughing stock in Eternal Chaotic World. This is because of Jian Wushuang.”

“I see,” Sir God Luo Sha looked at Jian Wushuang again but her gaze was different than before.

“Jian Wushuang, you can enter Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and you can stay however long you want,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was frilled with excitement, “And the price is?”

“There’s no price required. You can just enter. If there’s only one condition, it’s that after you increase your power, you’ll kill that b*stard Ling Yun on my behalf!” Sir God Luo Sha bellowed as murderous intention soared in her eyes.

“B*stard Ling Yun?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He didn’t even know who he was.

“Jian Wushuang, that b*stard Ling Yun that Sir God Luo Sha was talking about is the founder of Soaring Heaven King Palace, Emperor God Ling Yun. Soaring Heaven King Palace has two Emperor Gods. Emperor God Ling Yun is the oldest and also the strongest. Compared to Star Palace Master from Lineage of Star, he should only be stronger, not weaker. Of course, if Star Palace Master were to perform the secret skill of Star Palace with his all, Emperor God Ling Yun could only run away hastily,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

Sir God Mad Dog was talking to Jian Wushuang via communication token. Then, Sir God Luo Sha didn’t know what they were talking about.

“Judging from Sir God Luo Sha’s look, the rumor should be real,” Sir God Mad Dog sighed emotionally.

“Rumor? What rumor?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A rumor said that Sir God Luo Sha once had a loving husband, who was also a Sir God expert. The two of them were like a celestial couple. But then, somehow or other, her husband was killed by Emperor God Ling Yun. Sir God Luo Sha wanted to take revenge on Soaring Heaven King Palace badly once because of that. However, she was alone. She couldn’t cause such a major force like Soaring Heaven King Palace to move,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“This happened long ago. Plus, Sir God Luo Sha never brought it up herself so I didn’t know if it was true or false. But from what it seems, it should be true.”

“Jian Wushuang, you’re lucky!” Sir God Mad Dog teased.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

That was true.

He couldn’t pay the price that Sir God Luo Sha wanted. He thought he was predestined not to cross paths with Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, but who knew Sir God Luo Sha harbored such deep hatred against Soaring Heaven King Palace

Jian Wushuang had happened to fight against Soaring Heaven King Palace head-on which had made them suffer great losses and became a laughing stock. It simply meant that he had vented Sir God Luo Sha’s grievance.

“Jian Wushuang,” Sir God Luo Sha looked at Jian Wushuang, “You made Soaring Heaven King Palace suffer a great loss and they definitely won’t let it slip. Back then, my husband merely taught the disciple of Soaring Heaven King Palace a lesson as he couldn’t stand their barbaric behavior, then b*stard Ling Yun took action personally to kill my husband!”

“My husband was naturally gifted. If it wasn’t because of b*stard Ling Yun, he would have become an Emperor by now!”

“You, in terms of potential, are not inferior to my husband. Soaring Heaven King Palace won’t let you continue to grow. They definitely won’t !”

“So, show no mercy, don’t win by luck or think that you might be able to resolve the resentment with Soaring Heaven King Palace. It is impossible, definitely impossible!”

“What you need to do is to destroy Soaring Heaven King Palace entirely and kill all of them. Then, you can live in this world in peace.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn. He knew that Sir God Luo Sha was speaking the truth.

Soaring Heaven King Palace definitely wouldn’t let it go.

Between him and Soaring Heaven King Palace, there wasn’t any possibility to resolve resentment. Soaring Heaven King Palace would definitely stop at nothing until he died.

After quite some time, Sir God Luo Sha finally calmed down.

“Excuse me. Sorry that I lost control,” Sir God Luo Sha’s face became cold, “Jian Wushuang, follow me.”

Sir God Luo Sha led Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog to the void at the back.

Very soon, the three of them arrived at the core of the piece of floating land. It was covered within a prohibition and they could faintly see a pond. The pond wasn’t huge in size but it looked rather deep.

Jian Wushuang heard from Hall Master Gu Xin back in Lineage of Star that Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was nine hundred and ninety nine thousand and nine hundred zhang deep!

“That is Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. You can enter directly. But remember, you must only absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning. Don’t touch or move the special prohibition or formation in the divine pond. The formation is extremely important to the divine pond. Once it’s moved, the consequences will be disastrous,” Sir God Luo Sha exhorted.

“I understand. Thank you Sir God Luo Sha,” Jian Wushuang thanked her.

“Go ahead,” Sir God Luo Sha waved her hand.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and took a stride forward and plunged towards the divine pond. He arrived at the pond very soon.

“Old witch, you were quite generous this time. You let Jian Wushuang absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning to his heart’s content. He is an inverse cultivator! Aren’t you afraid that he will finish up the Power of Absolute Beginning?” Sir God Mad Dog smiled.

“Humph, my Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning isn’t as simple as you think it is. So what if he is an inverse cultivator? As long as he is capable, go ahead and absorb it! If he were to have the capability to absorb one-hundredth of the divine pond, I’d think he was impressive,” Sir God Luo Sha sneered.

“Plus, this young man embarrassed Soaring Heaven King Palace! Forget about the one-hundredth Power of Absolute Beginning, even if he took away one-tenth Power of Absolute Beginning, I’d let him in.”

“Because… I am happy!!”
