“This is the island where Universe God Qian Luan is at now. We call it Leopard-print Island. Go prepare yourself and set off as soon as possible,” said the commander.

“Understood, commander.” Jian Wushuang replied.

Then, he left quickly.

Seeing Jian Wushuang walking out, Lin Dong and Mo You, who had been waiting outside, immediately came up to him.

“How did it go, Jian Wushuang? What did the commander say?” Lin Dong asked Jian Wushuang.

“The commander just asked me a few questions and he gave me another mission which requires me to set off as soon as possible.” Jian Wushuang chatted with Lin Dong and Mo You while walking.

“Another mission?” Both Lin Dong and Mo You had odd expressions on their faces. The former spoke in a pitying tone, “I planned to hold a welcoming feast for you, for joining us and also to celebrate our completed mission, but now, it seems you are going to leave us soon?”

“We can hold it sometime later.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The three men continued chatting for a while in the camp before Jian Wushuang set off to Leopard-print Island. He did not have to make any preparations.

But just as he was ready to leave,

Weng!

An overbearing force oppressed him, followed by a figure that approached him speedily from a distance. Soon the figure appeared in front of the trio.

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang looked at the newcomer with a frown.

“It’s him!” Lin Dong and Mo You both looked surprised.

The newcomer wore a green robe, had a thin moustache and a swarthy complexion. He had a savage look about him.

After he appeared, he glanced at the three and finally, his eyes landed on Jian Wushuang. “Are you the seventh Divine General, Jian Wushuang?”

His loud voice resounded throughout the camp and an uproar broke out immediately.

Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

Soldiers rushed toward the three from all directions after hearing the commotion, including some sergeants and Divine Generals.

“It is him, Hong Shou!”

“The first Divine General!”

“He looks very angry. Who provoked him?”

The sergeants started talking about the man in extremely low tones.

“Jian Wushuang, he is the first Divine General, Hong Shou, the strongest among all the Divine Generals. He is very narrow-minded and overbearing.” Lin Dong lowered his voice when he whispered to Jian Wushuang.

“The first Divine General?” Jian Wushuang frowned and took a step forward, asking, “Yes, I’m Jian Wushuang. Why are you looking for me?”

Jian Wushuang looked quite calm as if he did not take this powerful Divine General seriously at all.

“Jian Wushuang.” Hong Shou stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Hong Shou, Jian Wushuang has just received a mission from the commander and is about to set off. At this point, what is your business in looking for him?” Lin Dong chimed in with a frown.

“Shut up!” HHong Shou shouted fiercely at him, giving out a sense of Killing Intent.

“Hong Shou!” Lin Dong’s face suddenly darkened.

Although he was a bit weaker than Hong Shou, he was the second Divine General and in the same position as Hong Shou in the army, therefore, he was annoyed at being shouted at in front of so many soldiers.

“Just received a mission from the commander?” “Hump, that mission should have been mine!” Hong Shou roared.

“What?” The surrounding sergeants were surprised to hear that and all looked toward Jian Wushuang.

With eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang, Hong Shou shouted again. “If you want to take charge of that mission, just take it, I don’t care. But the commander told me that he turned the mission to you because you’re stronger than me and he has more confidence in you!”

“Hump, I can’t accept that excuse!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Upon hearing this, all the sergeants present immediately understood what the whole thing was about.

“I can finally understand what they are talking about.”

“No wonder the first Divine General is so angry. It turns out that the commander thinks Jian Wushuang is stronger than him.”

“The first Divine General is full of pride. No wonder he is so angry about the commander’s comment.”

Jian Wushuang was confused for a moment after hearing Hong Shou’s words, but he quickly understood the situation .

“The commander has deliberately enraged Hong Shou by saying that.”?He thought to himself.

He was sure the commander must be watching them from somewhere at this moment.

“He wants to test my power through Hong Shou.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang smiled fainlty before looking up and said, “The first Divine General, did you come here to challenge me?”

“Of course.” Hong Shou nodded intently, “The first Divine General post of our island has always been served by the strongest Universe Master among us. If you win, you can take my place to be the first Divine General; but if you lose, hump, you can still carry on with that mission, only that you should be more humble after that.”

“Ok, now, make your move.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, still looking very undisturbed.

“Hong Shou is asking for trouble.”

“Hump, Hong Shou has never respected other Divine Generals. Now, since he dared to provoke Jian Wushuang, we will wait and watch him get into trouble. His time as the first Divine General has come to an end.”

Lin Dong and Mo You, who stood next to Jian Wushuang, secretly laughed at this.

Hong Shou was very unpopular on Scarlet Island and was not on good terms with the other Divine Generals, who had detested his supercilious manner for a long time. Now, seeing that he would be in trouble, Lin Dong and Mo Youxin gloated over it.

The two of them had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s power in Red Water City. In their view, Hong Shou was no match for Jian Wushuang.

Hong Shou had no idea about their thoughts.

He only knew that Jian Wushuang had accepted his challenge.

With a sneer, he held a cyan saber in his hand.

“Jian Wushuang, I don’t want to bully you, so I?will let you attack first!” Hong Shou stood in a commanding manner, saber in hand.

Seeing that, Jian Wushuang forced a smile and shook his head secretly.

“If so, then you should be careful.”

JJian Wushuang did not want to waste his time on Hong Shou. He took out his Blood Mountain Sword and struck first.

With that move, a dazzling sword light flashed to Hong Shou through the void. When it was about to strike Hong Shou, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled as if he had only exerted only about thirty percent of his powers.
