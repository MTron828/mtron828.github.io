2044 Demolish

The golden prohibition shattered. The originally organized golden whirlpool lost its balance and stirred up a great commotion!

Rumble!!!

The entire huge golden whirlpool quivered vigorously. The ocean of pure energy instantly turned into a terrifying energy storm and swept out.

There was a sudden explosion of energy storm. It absolutely could tear an Emperor God into pieces at the first instance.

Even an expert of Great Emperor level who had a weaker divine body would be severely injured by the sudden howl of energy storm.

However, Jian Wushuang could stand strong in the middle of the energy storm.

“During the war thirty years ago, I attacked the golden whirlpool for so long and the energy storm that I stirred up wasn’t this strong. As expected, the golden prohibition is the pivotal element of the surrounding great formation,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The golden prohibition shattered and the entire golden whirlpool collapsed.

However, Jian Wushuang’s gaze was fixed upon the mountain-size Emperor Supreme Rock in front of him.

The Emperor Supreme Rock was at the root of everything.

The golden prohibition, the golden whirlpool, even the dark millstone was powered by the Emperor Supreme Rock as the source of their energy.

Then, even though Jian Wushuang had destroyed the golden prohibition and the golden whirlpool, the experts in Three-Emperors World could still have a way to recover them as long as the Emperor Supreme Rock was still there.

“Without the guidance of the golden prohibition, I wonder if I could refine the Emperor Supreme Rock directly?” There was an idea that popped up in Jian Wushuang’s head and he immediately gave it a try.

Just as he was trying his best to refine the Emperor Supreme Rock, there was a great commotion in Imperial Peak.

The three Great Emperors in the palace above the golden whirlpool stood guard at the golden whirlpool all year round. They were naturally the first to notice the drastic change in the golden whirlpool.

However, when the three Great?Emperors came back to reality, the golden whirlpool had already begun to collapse.

“Shit!!”

“What happened?”

“How could this happen?”

The three Great Emperors were shocked.

They had been in the void above the golden whirlpool and they had been watching the golden whirlpool. A few moments ago, the golden whirlpool had still been at peace.

Then, the golden whirlpool had collapsed?

“Look!”

The redhead elder shouted as he pointed at the middle of the golden whirlpool, where the huge Emperor Supreme Rock was.

They could faintly see a human figure there.

“D*mn it!”

The three of their faces grew grave and they immediately charge to the collapsing golden whirlpool.

Besides, there were figures soaring in Imperial Cabinet located at the highest point in Imperial Peak.

The figures included the beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, who Jian Wushuang was familiar with, the tall and sturdy middle-aged man that was not any weaker than Ling Zong, and also the other eight Great Emperors.

They noticed the drastic change in the golden whirlpool.

“How could it be?”

“Let’s go. Let’s rush over.”

The Great Emperors looked distressed and they rushed to the golden whirlpool at their fastest possible speed.

As for the cultivators in early stage and middle stage Chaotic Realm in Imperial Peak, they were astonished too.

In the collapsing golden whirlpool, it was replaced with the terrifying energy storm.

In the middle of the storm, Jian Wushuang was trying to refine the Emperor Supreme Rock. However, he gave up after a short while. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This is too huge. The Emperor Supreme Rock is too huge. The pure energy it contains is ridiculously strong. With my power, I could refine it but it would require a very long time. I would need at least ten thousand years. On top of that, the Emperor Supreme Rock is quite unique. I can’t take it away if I didn’t refine it,” Jian Wushuang let out a sigh but he looked like he’d already made a decision.

“If I can’t refine and absorb it, I will have to forcefully destroy it!”

Jian Wushuang raised his sword up high in the sky.

There was a supreme sword intention of an Emperor Sword that gradually swept out.

Among all Sword Principles that Jian Wushuang mastered, the strongest in terms of power was still King Sword Principle.

However, King Sword Principle required time for power accumulation. As his opponent hardly give him any time during close body combat, Sword Principle Xuan Luo would be a better one to perform.

But now, no one could stop him. Hence, Jian Wushuang naturally performed King Sword Principle.

Besides, Jian Wushuang knew how sturdy the Emperor Supreme Rock was long ago.

Jian Wushuang had once performed Blast Rainstorm on Emperor Supreme Rock but he hadn’t left any mark on it. Although his power had improved tremendously, it would still be unrealistic if he wanted to completely destroy Emperor Supreme Rock with King Sword Principle.

Hence, when he performed the sword principle, there was a bold of mysterious yet fierce power that filled the air.

The power as the power of Star!!!

Jian Wushuang was performing his greatest trump card, the secret skill of Star Palace.

It wasn’t easy to perform the secret skill. Jian Wushuang would definitely not perform it unless it was at a crucial time.

At this point, he couldn’t think so much because he had to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock completely.

There was a terrifying sword shadow that substantiated in the void from nowhere.

The sword shadow was like the Emperor’s Sword. It was as though billions of heads would fall on the ground with one stroke.

The power was enough to shake an ordinary Great Emperor.

However, the terrifying sword shadow’s power had increased by a thousand times under the effect of the third volume in the secret skill of Star Palace!!!

It was already enough to shake an ordinary Great Emperor to begin with. Now, its power increased had by a thousandfold?

What had happened?

Just how powerful was the stroke?

There was no doubt that the power of the stroke exceeded a Great Emperor’s capability. Even Emperor Bai, who was widely known as the strongest one in Eternal Chaotic World, would find it hard to achieve such a level when he performed his strongest hit.

The Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World who were rushing to the middle of the golden whirlpool were dumbfounded when they looked up at the sword shadow.

Even the strongest Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man stood dumbfounded at the sight.

Because they realized that the stroke wasn’t something that the Great Emperors could achieve.

The stroke hit the hundred-zhang-tall, mountain-like Emperor Supreme Rock without any hindrance, the so-called Holy Crystal.

The sword light hit the Holy Crystal and a terrifying power exploded.

Rumble.

Even a Great Emperor’s full hit couldn’t shake the mountain-like Emperor Supreme Rock, but it was quivering vigorously under the sword light.

There was a vigorous quivered then… Crack! Crack!

There were soft cracking noises and all the cultivators in Three-Emperors World stared with eyes wide opened.

The cracks on the Emperor Supreme Rock became visible and the cracks became wider. In the end, the Emperor Supreme Rock shattered.

Emperor Supreme Rock shattered!!!
