Chapter 2569: Bet for High Stakes

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The atmosphere was extremely solemn in the meeting room.

Situ Yuan continued, “Putting aside Jian Yi’s origins and background, we can be sure that he’s set to go against San Shouwang. The point is we have no idea if he has the capabilities to do so. We have to figure out if Jian Yi is just being arrogant and overconfident or does he really does have the capabilities.”

“Clan Leader, are you saying the Situ Clan will help Jian Yi if he’s capable of standing up against San Shouwang in a duel?” asked the old woman.

“Why don’t we bet on his capabilities?” Situ Yuan grinned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Bet on it?” The Three Elders were startled.

“Yes, let’s make a bet!” Situ Yuan solemnly said, “San Shouwang has made it clear that he intends to topple the Situ Clan so we must be well prepared for the attack. Once he attacks, I’m afraid the Situ Clan won’t stand any chance against him. In that case, why don’t we take a chance? Let’s place our bets on Jian Yi!

“We help him get rid of the Official Army and deal with San Shouwang. If he manages to kill San Shouwang and replace him as the new Territorial Lord, the Situ Clan’s plight will be lifted. We might even end up being elevated to the same rank as the Shi Clan and Wu Clan—the Northern Darkstar Continent’s top-tier clans—based on our relationship with Jian Yi!”

The Three Elders looked at each other before the old woman asked, “What if we lose the bet?”

“If we lose then we’re doomed. We’ll end up like the Xiao Clan without any means to defend ourselves.” Situ Yuan’s voice sank when he brought that up.

“However, we’re not entirely the same as the Xiao Clan who had been passive until the day they were annihilated by San Shouwang. They did not have a Plan B and as the result, Xiao Tiexin was Xiao Clan’s only survivor. We’ll take the initiative to move some of our disciples away so that even if the Situ Clan is destroyed in the end, we won’t be as miserable as the Xiao Clan.”

The Three Elders went silent.

They had to admit they were indeed in a difficult situation from deciding the Situ Clan’s life and death.

One wrong move would cause a miserable defeat, a correct move...

The old woman’s brows were knitted together as she dwelled further into the consequences of both choices. “Even if we win the bet, we might not end up like your presumptions as we don’t really know Jian Yi. Though he’s indebted to us, many in this world are ungrateful. He used some lame excuses against the mid-tier clans just to get some Primordial Stones. How can we be sure that he won’t be mean to us after becoming the new Territorial Lord?”

“Indeed, that’s why I’ve said it’s a tough bet. Not only are we betting on Jian Yi being capable of killing San Shouwang, but we’re also betting on his character. We’re placing a bet that he’ll honor his words,” said Situ Yuan solemnly.

The Three Elders frowned deeper.

They were making a high stake bet with a price too great to be paid if they lost the bet.

The Three Elders were indecisive.

Situ Yuan continued speaking, “Three Elders, we have no choice! The fate of our clan is on the line. Jian Yi is the rope for us to get off the cliff’s edge. The rope may not be strong and we might still end up falling to our death but if we don’t catch it, we may be able to live a little longer but will still end up dying for sure!”

Situ Yuan’s analogy was apt and convinced the Three Elders.

After careful consideration, they agreed that the Situ Clan was left with no other choice!

Without Jian Wushuang, they might live a little longer before suffering a miserable death but Jian Wushuang had given them faint hope of possible survival!

It was a faint hope but still better than nothing!

After a brief discussion between the three Elders, the old woman made a solemn decision. “Clan Leader, we’ll listen to you. You can call the shots!”

“Okay, let’s bet on the basis that Jian Yi must have the strength to topple San Shouwang. He’s required to prove himself to us. Let’s look for him now!” Situ Yuan exclaimed.

“Now? Didn’t he say he’s coming tomorrow?” The old woman was surprised.

“No, let’s go find him now. The earlier we make a decision, the more time we have to plan for it.”

Situ Yuan was decisive.

He immediately brought the Three Elders to where Jian Wushuang stayed.

It was late at night and Jian Wushuang was quietly having tea in the courtyard with Xiao Tiexin by his side.

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you sure the Situ Clan will agree to help you out? Will they come to you tonight?” Xiao Tiexin’s voice sounded a little strange.

“I’m quite good at reading people. I can see that Situ Yuan is smart and courageous. Otherwise, he won’t be hailed as the Clan Leader when he’s just a High-Level Ultimate God. He’s well aware of the Situ Clan’s plight so why won’t he latch onto the only opportunity he has—which is me—to get out of this sticky situation?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He felt something while he was only halfway through his cup of tea.

“They are here.” Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked toward the void above with a faint smile on his face.

Four figures had indeed come gliding down side-by-side in the night sky. They soon arrived at the courtyard.

“Clan Leader, I’ve been waiting for a long time.” Jian Wushuang’s light laughter rang in the courtyard.

“Mr. Jian Yi seems to have figured we’d be here.” Situ Yuan looked calmly at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course, I believe the Clan Leader will make the right choice. Please, have a seat.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and a few seats instantly appeared in the courtyard.

Situ Yuan and the Three Elders sat down.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I’ve carefully discussed with the Three Elders, and the Situ Clan can help you but the risk is too high for us. Therefore, we need to be assured that you have the capabilities to trounce San Shouwang.” Situ Yuan was quite straightforward.

“Well, I understand where you’re coming from. Showing my powers is but a simple task.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly before shifting his body as a terrifying burst of divine aura emanated from him.

His divine aura filled every corner of the courtyard but did not escape from its boundaries.

Situ Yuan and the Three Elders felt its powers.
