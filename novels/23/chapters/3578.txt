Chapter 3579: Supreme Imperishable Body

“The Ruler is still too far away for me. On the contrary, the second inner star secret skill can be cultivated by Principles Masters. With my life level, I might be able to cultivate it to a certain level at the level of the Immortal Saint. The only troublesome thing is that it’s difficult to find a genius earthly treasure to assist in cultivation. But if I really succeed in cultivating it...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

The second internal star secret technique was the undying godly body of a supreme being.

This secret technique could make one’s godly body indestructible. As long as one completed the first level, one’s godly body could rival a low-level universe true treasure. This was too terrifying.

Universe true treasures, even if they were only at the level of a low-level universe true treasure, were incredibly tough.

There were so many great beings in this territory, but even a Ruler Realm great being who stood at the top of this territory could not destroy a low-level universe true treasure with his own power. It was because of this level of true treasure, it was not something an ordinary Ruler Realm great being could shake.

If his godly body alone could rival a low-level universe true treasure, then not only would his offensive power increase by another level, but his defensive power would be too strong.

Without the strength of a Ruler, it would be impossible for a divine body comparable to an elementary universe supreme treasure to destroy his divine power. Even a Ruler Realm expert would have a hard time dealing with such an indestructible divine body, this was because a Ruler Realm attack would be weakened to a very low level when it passed through his divine body. Only then would it affect Jian Wushuang’s body, the real damage to Jian Wushuang would be very, very small.

It could be said that if he could cultivate the first level of the supreme eternal celestial body, he would be able to do whatever he wanted in this territory in the future. Even if he encountered an expert at the Ruler Realm, he would not be afraid at all.

“Just the first level alone is enough, and the second and third levels of the supreme eternal celestial body are unimaginable. This secret skill is very useful to me.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly, and a fierce light flashed in his eyes, taking a deep breath, he said directly, “Lord Wind Demon, I’ve decided to choose the supreme imperishable body.”

“The body-refining secret skill?” The Golden War God glanced at Jian Wushuang and nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang’s choice was not unexpected. He only had two inner star secret skills, and the supreme imperishable body was more suitable for Jian Wushuang than the first one.

“Now that you’ve made your choice, come over and drop a drop of blood essence into the stone tablet. After that, you’ll be an inner star disciple under the command of Planet Lingyun. I’ll give you an inner star disciple token. From now on, you can use this token to sense if there are any experts from Planet Lingyun around.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“In addition, this stone tablet will transmit the complete supreme imperishable celestial body technique to your mind. However, although you’ve obtained the technique, you can only cultivate it by yourself in the future. You can’t teach it to others. Even if you want to, it’s useless because you can’t do it,” the Golden War God said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged and walked to the golden stone tablet, dropping a drop of his blood essence into it.

As soon as the blood essence entered the stone tablet, ancient golden characters floated out of the golden stone tablet and entered Jian Wushuang’s body.

“These characters...”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He did not know what these golden characters were, but he was not unfamiliar with them.

There was even a similar golden character on the back of his right hand. This golden character represented the six-path reincarnation secret skill that he had comprehended in the Heaven-cleaving Secret Realm.

“Heaven-cleaving Secret Realm, Black Divine Pillar?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

When he had obtained the opportunity in the Heaven-cleaving Secret Realm, he had also mastered the six-path reincarnation secret skill.

There were a total of 16 such ancient golden characters on the Black Divine Pillar. Later, he learned that the 16 ancient golden characters represented 16 different secret skills.

Jian Wushuang was very curious about the origin of the 16 golden characters. Now, he saw the same golden characters, but this time, the golden characters surged out from the golden stone tablet.

“It seems that the Black Divine Pillar of the Heaven-cleaving Secret Realm is from the deepest part of the universe, just like this golden stone tablet,” Jian Wushuang murmured. He guessed that these golden characters were passed down from the deepest part of the universe.

As for the specific meaning of these golden words, he still did not know.

After these golden words entered his body, they completely stayed in his mind. Jian Wushuang could sense the existence of these golden words, at the same time, he also sensed the powerful divine body secret skill contained in these golden words.

“It seems that before I cultivate the supreme eternal celestial body, I have to comprehend the secret skill from these golden words,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“This is your identity token. Take it and you can leave this time and space,” the Golden War God said.

“Leave now?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, but he said, “Lord Wind Demon, I have obtained a top-tier universe supreme treasure armor in this time and space. I want to completely refine this armor before I go out.”

“It’s up to you. In short, I will open the exit passage of this space-time later. This passage is at the end of this direction.” The Golden War God pointed in a direction. “If you are willing, it doesn’t matter if you stay here for a while, but you must not wander around. Master personally arranged this space-time. Although master is not here now and my brothers control it, there are some places in this space-time that have strict rules. Even us brothers can’t control them.”

“Just like the 18-ultimate formation you just broke through, it was left behind by master. As long as you fall into it, you can only do as master asks. We can’t stop you, so if you continue to break into some special places, get trapped, or even die, I can only watch.”

“I understand. I’ll only refine the supreme treasure armor and then go out. I won’t wander around recklessly,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, you can arrange it yourself.” The Golden War God nodded. “My brothers are not in their peak condition. They have been sleeping here for a long time. I think they will stay here for a long time. If you encounter any problems in the future, you can come here. We are both from the Planet Lingyun. If we can help you, we will do our best to help you.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.
