Chapter 1269: A Secret Chamber

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Though it was an island, Leopard-print Island was very vast and was no smaller than the cities in the Dayu Region.

It had a lot of Leopard-print Gems buried in its grounds. After Scarlet Island took over it, many cultivators started mining for the gems in it.

Following Universe God Qian Luan, Jian Wushuang moved slowly toward the core place.

Along the way, he could see many people mining.

“The Leopard-print Gem is widely used in refining weapons, setting Formations and it can also help cultivators comprehend. Therefore, it’s more valuable than many other gems in the Eternal Chaotic World. I can’t imagine how much such a large area of Leopard-print Gem Mine under this ground is worth.”

“No wonder Scarlet Island and Xiu kingdom have fought aggressively for it.” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

Universe God Qian Luan, who was leading the way, suddenly paused in her steps.

“We are here” She turned back and said to Jian Wushuang in a hushed tone.

“Wow.” Jian Wushuang immediately looked ahead and his eyes narrowed.

“This is… a secret chamber?”

He was surprised.

At that moment, they were in the depths of the Leopard-print Gem Mine. However, there was a large secret chamber in front of them.

“Let us go in.” Universe God Qian Luan led Jian Wushuang into the chamber.

The chamber was empty, except for a piece of cyan stone in its center.

“It looks like a Formation has been set up in this chamber.” Jian Wushuang looked around and he could feel that doing one’s cultivation in this room would be much more efficient than on the outside.

“You’re right. There is a Formation which has been set up based on the Leopard-print Gems, in order to improve the efficiency in cultivating,” Universe God Qian Luan said to Jian Wushuang.

“Well, it’s true that with the help of the Formation and the gems, cultivating here will be more efficient than cultivating outside. This, however, would not make the chamber so rare that any Universe God can achieve that through setting up some better Formations” Jian Wushuang said.

“You’re right. The most precious thing in this room is not the Formation or the room itself but that cyan stone. Take a closer look at it, Jian Wushuang,” she said.

“The stone?” Jian Wushuang immediately took a closer look at the cyan stone in front of him and he noticed that there were two large words etched on it.

The words had been engraved deep into the stone with some sharp tools, probably with a sword.

“Yan Jiu?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the two words.

“Is that a person’s name?” Jian Wushuang asked, seemingly confused. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, it’s a name.” Universe God Qian Luan nodded and continued, “This name may sound quite strange to you, a new arrival from your hometown, but for those cultivators who have spent millions or even tens of millions of years in Dayu Region, this name has a special meaning.”

“Yan Jiu was a formidable Universe God who rose in fame in our region seven million years ago.”

“His swordsmanship was extremely brilliant. At the same time, he was the only person who had dared to threaten Dayu Palace during the past years.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned when he heard that.

Threaten Dayu Palace?

The palace was the local tyrant of the Dayu Region.

No matter how fiercely Scarlet Island, the Golden-sun Sect and the Holy Prefecture fought with each other, none of them dared to provoke the Dayu Palace.

The palace was a force of real supremacy. The Master of the palace was the only Universe God in the Third Heaven in the Dayu Region, who was recognized even by the Snow Kingdom..

However, seven million years ago, Yan Jiu threatened Dayu Palace and even threatened its master?

“Seven million years ago, Yan Jiu fought with the Master of Dayu Palace and it ended in a draw. At that time, he was just in the Second Heaven.” Universe God Qian Luan continued.

“What?” “A Universe God in the Second Heaven was evenly matched to a god in the Third Heaven?” Jian Wushuang became even more stunned.

After all, there was a big difference between two levels of the Universe God, let alone between the two Realms.

Even Jian Wushuang, as an Inverse Cultivator, had no confidence in breaking into the Third Heaven from the Second Heaven, although Yan Jiu made it.

“Yan Jiu was really strong at that time. After he his battle with the Master of Dayu Palace, everyone assumed that when he reached the Third Heaven, he would replace the master and become the number one expert in the Dayu Region. However, after the battle, he disappeared. Some people said that he had left the region while others said that he died after the third God Test. Since then, there has been no news of him.

“He has, therefore, become a legend in the Dayu Region, but just two days ago, when we were exploring this mine, we discovered this secret chamber. It is obviously related to Yanjiu. He might have set up the Formation and practiced here for some time,” Universe God Qian Luan said to Jian Wushuang.

“I agree.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Judging from the words on the stone, he could tell it had been left by some experts of Sword Principle.

It probably was Yan Jiu.

“Jian Wushuang, you are good at Sword Principle as well. You must know what these two words mean, right?” Universe God Qian Luan continued.

“Yes, I do.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and there was a sparkle in his eyes. By observing how the two words “Yan Jiu” were engraved, he discovered an extremely powerful and terrifying skill hidden behind them.

Though it was just a single move, for those cultivators of Sword Principle, it meant a great opportunity.

“Although I can’t fully learn the skill of this move left by Yan Jiu, I can observe its essence; it will be helpful for my own swordsmanship. As I see it, this skill is aimed at speed. Based on this, I may create a skill of high speed.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll leave this secret chamber to you. You can meditate in it before the experts of?Xiu kingdom invade the island. By then, I hope that you have improved your power and can give us more support in fighting against them.” Universe God Qian Luan told Jian Wushuang her wish.

“I understand” Jian Wushuang nodded.
