Chapter 517: A Gift From Emperor Fengxiao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“There is another Second-grade Divine General apart from me?” Jin Ling glanced at Jian Wushuang. He said with a sneer, “This must be because he just met the requirements by squeaking through the Third Level.”

He was proud as a peacock.

Although Jian Wushuang was appointed a Second-grade Divine General like him, Jin Ling still thought Jian Wushuang was weaker than him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After all, there were differences in strength though both were Second-grade Divine Generals.

But at the moment, the red-robed woman looked at Jian Wushuang and continued, “Jian Wushuang, you performed well in the Gladiator Arena. Emperor Fengxiao praised you and decided to give you a present.”

After this announcement, she threw the Jade Slip from Emperor Fengxiao to Jian Wushuang.

Catching the Jade Slip and holding it, Jian Wushuang was a little surprised.

“Emperor Fengxiao, gave me a gift?”

Looking at the golden Jade Slip in his hand, he didn’t find anything special except for its aura and the number “10” on it.

The open space was in an uproar.

Many experts present threw admiring glances at Jian Wushuang.

“Did Emperor Fengxiao praise Jian Wushuang and give him a gift?”

“Usually, Divine Emperors of the Monster-exterminating League never praise an ordinary warrior. To receive a present is a rare honor.”

“It means that Emperor Fengxiao thinks highly of him. If he keeps improving, it’s highly possible that he can study under Emperor Fengxiao.”

People in the open space were freely discussing.

No one noticed that at the perimeter of the open space, the red-haired young man, Jin Ling, was staring at the Jade Slip in Jian Wushuang’s hand in shock.

“That, that’s a pledge of the Earth Core Palace, a golden one!”

“How could this be? ”

“Such a precious treasure is hard to obtain even if it were my father. How could Emperor Fengxiao give it to him?”

Others didn’t know the Jade Slip’s value, but Jin Ling did.

That was why he was shocked.

“The Jade Slip is so valuable. But it seems that this young man is not aware of this.” After looking at Jian Wushuang, Jin Ling narrowed his eyes and felt envious.

“Bastard!”

“If he were not here, Emperor Fengxiao might give it to me!”

“It’s his fault!”

Hatred arose in Jin Ling but was carefully concealed. No one even noticed it.

“Alright, those who failed can leave now. Those who passed come to me and take your ID tokens,” said the red-robed woman.

Those who passed, including Jian Wushuang, went forward.

A Divine General token had a special aura. Those around could perceive it after the token was refined. Thus they would know the identity of the token’s master.

Jian Wushuang received a Second-grade Divine General token from the red-robed woman and made himself its master.

“All of you can leave now.” The red-robed woman said and waved her hand.

They all went to the hall of the Saint Castle.

In the hall, Qing Huo was waiting for him at the counter, holding a pot of wine and talking with the blue-haired beauty.

“Qing Huo.” Jian Wushuang went to him.

“Fellow Wushuang, how did you go?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Did you pass it?”

“Yes. I’m a Second-grade Divine General now.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“A Second-grade Divine General? Usually only an Eight-cloud Realm expert would qualify,”marveled Qing Huo. Then he laughed and said, “I knew you could pass the assessment.”

“To be a Divine General means that you have been admitted into the Holy Place. Wushuang, do you want to go to the Holy Place?”

“The Holy Place?”Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

It was not the first time he heard about the Holy Place.

The Holy Place of Monster-exterminating League, was a Cultivation Sanctuary for humans on the Monster Continent. It contained many opportunities.

Many Divine Generals even Divine Emperors of Monster-exterminating League cultivated in the Holy Place, which was also open to them.

“Of course, but not now. Having been in the Monster Continent for so long, it’s my first time visiting the city, I want to have a look first.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, I’ll go with you.” Qing Huo laughed.

Then they walked outside of the Saint Castle.

Both of them didn’t notice that a red-haired man in a corner was gazing at Jian Wushuang carefully. After observing Jian Wushuang leaving the Saint Castle, Jin Ling pondered, then followed them.

Heaven Wing City was bustling with many shops.

A moment later, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo arrived at a big black pavilion.

“It’s Heaven Wing Pavilion, the biggest market in Heaven Wing City for buying and selling. The purchasing price is 90% of the selling price. Selling to them might incur a little loss but it is convenient.” Qing Huo said.

“Let’s enter and have a look.” Jian Wushuang stepped into the Heaven Wing Pavilion.

Heaven Wing Pavilion was three-stories and there were many treasures in each story.

Entering the hall of the first floor, Jian Wushuang saw many treasures, but they were all common. Jian Wushuang was uninterested in them, but many warriors of the tribes were perusing the treasures.

“Two Lords, most of the treasures in the first floor are common grade. It’s better for you to go to the third floor if you want to buy something.” An attendant walked to them and said.

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo looked at each other. Both of them had refined Divine General tokens, and that special aura was easy to be perceived. Therefore, others could recognize them immediately.

They didn’t delay in the first floor anymore and walked up the stairs to the hall of the third floor of Heaven Wing Pavilion.

The number of treasures on the third floor was less than on the first floor, but more valuable.
