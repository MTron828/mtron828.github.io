Chapter 536: Outrage

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The breach which allowed two Demonic Beasts to enter simultaneously was currently their biggest source of trouble.

While they were busy fighting with the Demonic Beasts, quite a lot of Demonic Beasts had swarmed through the breach. Fortunately, not too many Demonic Beasts had gathered in the Zone No. 14. Otherwise, thousands of Demonic Beasts could have rushed into the Formation in the blink of an eye.

While Jian Wushuang was in deep thought, suddenly...

“Oh, damn!”

Someone suddenly shouted in a panic, causing the human sergeants to immediately turn and look at the breach. They could see through the Formation that a stream of countless Demonic Beasts had arrived and dozens of Demonic Beasts had broken into the battlefield through the breach in a second.

Those Demonic Beasts were extremely powerful. Even the weakest ones were Rank Seven Monsters. There were even more than a dozen Rank Eight Monsters.

“They’re Demonic Beast reinforcements!”

“Oh, no!”

“This is going to be big trouble!”

The sergeants of the human camp became astonished at this scene.

Once the Demonic Beasts broke through into the battlefield, the human sergeants near the breach immediately began to suffer.

“No!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“We’ll die!”

The miserable shouts from human sergeants in the two squads guarding near the breach were heard.

Both squads belonged to the Seventh Army. One squad was led by Jin Ling and the other one was the third squad which was supposed to take over guarding Sky Solitude Mountains from Jian Wushuang’s squad.

The two squads had planned to block the breach. Nevertheless, as the powerful Demonic Beasts began swarming into the Formation, it was all they could do to save their own lives now.

Dozens of sergeants had been killed by the Demonic Beasts that had charged through.

But, even the remaining sergeants were still in danger.

“Go, go to save them!” Fang Han roared.

The other sergeants also understood why Fang Han was so anxious.

The two squads were in the middle of a terrible situation. Once the powerful Demonic Beasts entered the battlefield, they started to attack the two squads. Countless Demonic Beasts followed them and had completely encircled the two squads.

Without any reinforcements, the two squads would be killed in only a few breaths.

“Tenth squad, follow me!”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the sergeants behind him followed, charging towards the Demonic Beasts without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang had a personal grudge against Jin Ling. However, in the face of this crisis, all human sergeants chose to fight against the Demonic Beasts together. Jian Wushuang would naturally ignore his personal grudge for the moment.

Not to mention, Jin Ling was not the only one in danger.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang held the Triple-kill Sword in his hand, instantly releasing the sword essence and causing it to permeate the area.

It was a silent sword move.

A silent sword shadow flashed with a dazzling light and a Realm which seemed like it could exterminate everything.

The sword shadow glided through the area, leaving behind a Sword River in its wake.

It was the fourth move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Sheer Shadow!

The violent sword shadow directly hacked towards the three Rank Eight Monsters that were out in front.

They also counterattacked.

Bang!

The three Demonic Beasts were knocked back by the violent clash, while Jian Wushuang also retreated several steps.

The sergeants behind Jian Wushuang also pounced on the other Demonic Beasts.

With the support of Jian Wushuang and his squad, the third squad, which had fallen into despair, found an opportunity and struggled out from the encirclement of the Demonic Beasts.

However, Jin Ling and his squad were still in the middle of a crisis.

“Brother Wushuang, let’s cooperate and save them,” the leader of the third squad said.

“OK,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The two squads, with Jian Wushuang acting as the spearhead, attacked the Demonic Beasts violently and finally tore out a path to life for Jin Ling and his sergeants.

“Rush out!” Jin Ling growled and immediately seized the opportunity to break free from the encirclement.

“Jin Ling, cooperate with us, quickly. Let’s stop these Demonic Beasts.”

Seeing Jin Ling leaving, the leader of the third squad shouted to him.

“Cooperate?”

Jin Ling’s eyes were full of resentment. He glanced at Jian Wushuang behind him and looked at the swarming Demonic Beasts like wasps in front of him. His face became even more gloomy.

“Run! Run! Run!”

“Fast!”

Jin Ling growled in a shrill voice and then fled directly to the rear without hesitation. His sergeants obeyed his command unconsciously and also fled frantically to the rear.

All of the human sergeants were angry after seeing this. The sergeants of the third and tenth squads were especially outraged.

“Jin Ling, what are you doing?” Fang Han also yelled.

Everyone was outraged by Jin Ling’s action!

When he had been in crisis, Jian Wushuang had immediately led his squad to save him and cooperated with the third squad to cut a path from the Demonic Beast group so that he could escape.

To rescue him, the two squads chose to fight with the numerous Demonic Beasts.

Jin Ling should have cooperated with the other two squads so that the three squads could have a better opportunity to survive.

On the contrary, Jin Ling chose to flee while ignoring the sergeants who had rescued him.

How could he ignore those who had fallen into a dangerous situation in order to save his life?

Selfish! Shameless! Ungrateful!

“Bastard!” the leader of the third squad shouted angrily.

“This bastard!”

“Son of b-!”

The sergeants of the tenth and third squad also could not help swearing.

However, Jin Ling didn’t pay any attention to them.

He was scared to death because he had almost died in the encirclement of the Demonic Beasts. At this moment, he only wanted to run for his life. He did not give a damn about anything else.

What’s more, Jian Wushuang was also in danger now.

“Hum, Jian Wushuang, aren’t you impressive? I can’t wait to see whether you’ll live or die!”

Jin Ling even took a kind of dark pleasure in it.
