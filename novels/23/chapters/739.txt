Chapter 740: The Three Secret Skills of the Ancient God Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Two-star Ancient God?” Jian Wushuang wore a wry smile.

He had just awakened the bloodline and become a One-star Ancient God, so he was far from being a Two-star Ancient God.

“Little Ying.” Elder Yi addressed Granny Ying. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Granny Ying was a highly respected Ancient God in the Eighth Tribe, but in front of Elder Yi, she became Little Ying. Obviously, Elder Yi had lived longer than Granny Ying.

“You brought the boy here for the Three Secret Skills, right?” Elder Yi asked.

Granny Ying nodded, saying, “That’s right.”

“The Three Secret Skills are the greatest foundation for our clan. Jian Wushuang, go and do some good cultivation,” Elder Yi responded while waving his hand, then the gate of the black pavilion opened.

“Jian Wushuang, go for it,” Granny Ying said.

Jian Wushuang walked inside without hesitation.

Inside, there was an open space with three stone tablets in the center.

Each of the stone tablets was 30 feet tall, black, and made from some special ore.

Many small, tightly packed characters were carved on them.

Each of the stone tablets had a Secret Skill recorded onto them.

Jian Wushuang went over to the first stone tablet engraved with the “Scarlet Eye” Secret Skill.

“The Scarlet Eye Secret Skill helps you see through reality and illusions. If someone reaches its limit, everything will be exposed to him under the scarlet eye!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked by its brief introduction.

See through reality and illusions?

Everything will be exposed to him under the scarlet eye?

This was a great Secret Skill!

Jian Wushuang continued and looked at the second Secret Skill…

The Three Secret Skills were “Scarlet Eye”, “Star-river”, and “Mind-controlling”.

The Scarlet Eye Secret Skill was rare.

The last two Secret Skills were used for attacking.

He had mastered the first three levels of the Star-river Secret Skill and improved his offensive power by nine times.

He had only seen the manuals of the first 11 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill when he was in the Eighth Tribe.

But now, faced with the complete manual of the Star-river Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang was rocked.

“34 levels?” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes, staring at the second stone tablet.

The Star-river Secret Skill actually had 34 levels.

What he had seen in the Eighth Tribe was less than one-third of the complete Secret Skill.

“Each level of the Star-river Secret Skill is able to improve my offensive power by three times. Now I’ve just reached Level Three, so my offensive power became nine times greater than before. If I reach Level 11, my offensive power will improve by 33 times.

“However, Level 11 is not the limit. If I reach Level 34, my offensive power will gain a hundredfold increase.”

Hundredfold increase!

Hundredfold offensive power!

The Secret Skills in the Firmament Territory often helped improve offensive power by 10 times at the most.

For Human Warriors, 10 times was their limit.

When he saw the first 11 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang was totally stupefied. And now he was even more shocked.

“It can actually help me obtain a hundredfold offensive power?

“This…”

Jian Wushuang was at a loss for words.

Aided by the Secret Skill, the Firmament Territory experts were only able to improve their offensive power by, at most, 10 times, while the Ancient Gods could get a hundredfold power increase if they reached the peak of the Star-river Secret Skill…

Powerful!

Terrifying!

This was the formidable Ancient God Clan.

The Mind-controlling Secret Skill was targeted at the opponent’s consciousness and soul.

If someone reached the elementary level, he was capable of attacking one’s consciousness.

Unlike the Eighteen Levels of Hell, which could pose a threat to one’s consciousness and stop his consciousness for a short moment, the Mind-controlling Secret Skill was used to attack one’s consciousness and make him tingle or confused.

If someone were to reach the supreme level, he would be able to attack one’s soul, which was strange and terrifying.

“Each of the Secret Skills is amazing.” Jian Wushuang could not hold back his praise.

The Demon Gods were already more powerful. Now, aided by the Three Secret Skills, they would be invincible.

“Clansmen who have awakened the Demon God bloodline are qualified to practice the Three Secret Skills. The better bloodline a Demon God possesses, the higher level he will reach. I’m a Gold-armored Ancient God and have a part of the Imperial Bloodline, so I’m able to cultivate it, but I don’t know how far I can go,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Then, he sat down with his legs crossed as he started to meditate on the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, which helped see through reality and illusions.

…

As Jian Wushuang was meditating on the Secret Skill, Granny Ying was still standing outside with respect.

“Each of our Three Secret Skills is profound. Although the boy has a part of the Imperial Bloodline, it’s impossible for him to master all of them in a short period of time. Little Ying, there’s no need to wait here. Go back to the tribe.

“And remember, don’t talk to anyone about the boy’s Imperial Bloodline and our clan’s secret.”

“OK.” Granny Ying nodded and then left.

Elder Yi sat cross-legged in front of the black pavilion.

“The boy has a part of the Imperial Bloodline, so it’s easy for him to master the River-star Secret Skill. But to practice the last two skills requires a superior understanding. I wonder how long he will meet the requirement for the two skills,” Elder Yi said quietly.

Then, he closed his eyes.
