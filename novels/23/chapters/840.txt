Chapter 841: The Divine Sea

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Treasure Vault, Jian Wushuang had paid 100 million Divine Gems for this item.

Not long after, he received the Yin-Yang Mirror and blended it into his body.

He had gained the treasure he wanted most, so he didn’t stay. He turned around and left straight away.

The scarlet-robed elder and Asura had been waiting outside for him.

“How is it going?” the scarlet-robed elder asked, looking at the boy.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“What you received in the Treasure Vault is your second special treatment as a Blood Eagle Guard. What I’ll give you next is the third special treatment, which is also the most appealing one of the three.”

“The Divine Sea!” The scarlet-robed elder became more serious. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“The Divine Sea?”

Jian Wushuang seemed puzzled about it, but Shura could not help but clench his fists while hearing the two words.

“Finally?”?Asura’s eyes brimmed with excitement.

“Asura, it looks like you’ve heard about it before?” The scarlet-robed elder looked over at Asura with interest.

“Right.”

Shura nodded. “I’ve heard of it. The Divine Sea is equivalent to a kind of fortune. Any Blood Eagle Guard is allowed to enter it for free and stay for a month. After one month, no matter who you are, your strength will make a big breakthrough!”

“Big breakthrough?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

The scarlet-robed elder smiled, and then slowly started to explain. “You are right, this Divine Sea is a sort of fortune.

“Blood Eagle Guards enjoy three special treatments. In fact, the Divine Sea is the most important and valuable.

“Tang of the East used every resource to build the Divine Sea. It was built at a huge cost.

“In the Tang of the East, there are not many people qualified to enter the Divine Sea. Blood Eagle Guards are, after all, one of the trump cards of the Imperial House. Therefore, any Blood Eagle Guard is entitled to stay in the Divine Sea for one month.

“Don’t underestimate this month. In normal cases, if a Blood Eagle Guard wants to stay there for a month, he has to pay a large sum of money. This sum is much more than all the possessions of an expert at Step Six of the Eternal Realm. It truly is an astronomical sum.

“In that month, ordinary Blood Eagle Guards will make great progress in their strength. Some powerful experts could gain even more in that month!

“Only Divine Realm experts like you can enter the Blood Eagle Guard. With such talent, you could certainly make unimaginable gains in the Divine Sea.”

Hearing this, Asura’s eyes shone with eagerness.

Jian Wushuang knew nothing about Divine Sea before, but now the elder’s introduction had ignited his expectations.

He did not expect that the Blood Eagle Guard would offer such a great opportunity.

“If ordinary Blood Eagle Guards will make great progress in one month, how much progress could I make?”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

Under the guidance of the scarlet-robed elder, Jian Wushuang and Asura came to a wormhole.

“This wormhole links to the Divine Sea. I’ve already sent a message to the commander. This wormhole will open soon. Make sure to make the most of your month there. As for how much you improve, that will depend on your own luck,” the elder said.

Jian Wushuang and Asura nodded.

They certainly would not miss such a rare opportunity.

It was not long before the wormhole opened. Jian Wushuang and Asura immediately stepped into it and were headed straight into the Divine Sea.

Buzz...

The light flashed. Then Jian Wushuang appeared over the vast sea.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, taking in the scene from above. He saw a splendid sea with scarlet water, full of a rich, bloody smell.

This was a blood sea!

The blood was bubbled and rolled continuously, and an immense vapor was rising.

“This is the greatly auspicious Divine Sea?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

With the naked eye, he could see how peculiar this sea was.

“I wonder how the Imperial House of Tang of the East made this blood sea. Anyway, I don’t care as long as it can greatly improve my strength.” Jian Wushuang took a slight breath and glided straight into the Divine Sea.

The moment he entered the sea, he sensed a scalding energy surging toward him.

The energy was incomparably mild, as if his mother embraced him, and then it gradually poured into his body through his pores.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang could not help but shiver.

He sensed the peculiarity of the scalding energy. Stimulating his Eight Extraordinary Meridians, bones, joints and even his pores, it even rushed into his sea of consciousness to nourish his sword heart.

“This feels so good...”

Jian Wushuang relaxed. He knew that the scalding energy did not cause any harm to his body, and that it was actually nourishing him.

His sword heart and body were starting to be enhanced.

His affinity for World Dao and Slaughter Dao also improved greatly, which surprised him the most.

His enlightenment of Dao was advancing at an amazing speed.

He was making rapid progress in every respect without using much effort.

In addition, his comprehension ability seemed to be infinitely magnified at this moment.

“Unbelievable!”

“The Divine Sea is incredible!”

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes in shock.

He was not clear about how the Divine Sea was made, but after he had really experienced it, he was certain that this Divine Sea promoted great fortune.

Jian Wushuang used his mind to call his Slaughter Body, and it appeared next to him.

The two Original Bodies, not wanting to waste a second, began their cultivation.
