Chapter 1910: Suppressing Three People Alone

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Merely the first seal wasn’t strong enough for the three of them to bother with.

The second seal, although it was more powerful, the three of them resisted it with full force.

Then, the even scarier third seal descended.

Let’s do it together!!”

Palace Master Wu Lui roared and his aura increased tremendously again.

Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church didn’t hesitate but gave their all.

The three Peak Emperor Gods gave their all again. The attack that they launched was slightly stronger than before.

Very soon, the two parties collided.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and the universe became quiet.

In the boundless galaxy, there was boundless divine power sweeping out in madness. Instantly, it formed a vast ocean of divine power.

In the divine power ocean, the three Peak Emperor Gods let out a low humph and their faces grew paler. The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church and Number One Divine King, who was weaker in defense, had blood flowing from the corners of their lips.

“How is it possible?”

Number One Divine King couldn’t hold back and roared angrily. His roar shook the universe.

Two hundred and fifty years ago, the three Peak Emperor Gods had joined forces and defeated Jian Wushuang.

But then, similarly, the three of them had joined forces but the result had been the total opposite. It wasn’t them who had suppressed Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang who had suppressed the three of them with the aid of Mountain River Map!

With his power alone, he had suppressed three Peak Emperor Gods!

Then, it was the terrifying fighting power that Jian Wushuang had shown.

However, there shouldn’t be any that possessed such fighting power among Emperor Gods.

It instantly stirred a great commotion from the bottom of the three Emperor Gods’ hearts. They found it unbelievable.

However, Jian Wushuang was extremely calm.

“Two hundred and fifty years ago, I wanted to show the white feather and I never revealed any of my trump cards. Just like this Mountain River Map, I’ve never used it!”

“But now, I give full play to Mountain River Map’s Power with my all.?Besides, the galaxy formation increases my power to a certain extent. My overall power has increased by almost twenty percent!”

“The combination of two, to suppress three Peak Emperor Gods in terms of power is not impossible!”

Jian Wushuang sneered and there was fighting intention soaring in his eyes.

“Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, let’s fight again!”

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang was boiling with rage. His body turned illusionary and charged out again.

The three Peak Emperor Gods’ faces grew grave.

At first, they had intended to take care of Jian Wushuang as early as possible, then they could help the surrounding battlefield.

At the surrounding battlefield, Star Extermination Alliance was already at a disadvantage. Plus, as the experts of Star Extermination Alliance passed away one after another, their condition continued to worsen.

In no time, they’d collapse entirely.

Then, the three of them wanted to take care of Jian Wushuang, it would be a wild dream.

“Three Peak Emperor Gods team up and you are suppressed by a Real God. The three of you are rubbish!” A cold humph was heard across the battlefield.

Palace Master Wu Luo and the other two suddenly burned with rage and they immediately looked to the source of the voice.

They happened to see a young man with snow-white hair towering in the void.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, don’t just stand there. If you are capable, come over here and fight with Jian Wushuang!” Palace Master Wu Luo said in a low voice.

“Yes, you can come and try,” Number One Divine King glared too.

“Humph, you have time to tease us. You might as well hurry up and figure out a way to take care of your opponent,” the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church humphed coldly.

They had noticed Emperor God Tian Ling’s situation long ago.

Since their battle began, Emperor God Tian Ling had been entangled by Qian Mingzi. They were in a constant, ferocious fight and had yet to call the match.

What did he have to tease them?

“Emperor God Tian Ling, the three of them are right. You’d better figure out how to get rid of me,” Qian Mingzi smiled at Emperor God Tian Ling.

“You?” Emperor God Tian Ling smiled in disdain, “I only didn’t want to attack so soon. But from the way it is now, I have no choice.”

“You have been holding back your power?” Qian Mingzi squinted his eyes.

Emperor God Tian Ling had yet to reply, but the black spear that was tightly clenched in his hands flew to the void in front of him.

Hualala. A huge whirlpool tunnel appeared from nowhere.

No one saw how Emperor God Tian Ling did his fierce attack as he merely let loose his grip and let the spear fly into the whirlpool tunnel.

Vroom!

The spacetime behind Qian Mingzi shattered. Although there was a long distance and Emperor God Tian Ling continued to stand where he was, the black spear in his hand immersed into the whirlpool tunnel and charged to Qian Mingzi’s head.

It was too fast and it was indescribable as neither lightning nor fire. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“This spear!”

Qian Mingzi stared and his heart skipped a beat.

He had fought with Emperor God Tian Ling earlier. Although the fighting power that he had displayed was shocking and was enough to be listed in the top twenty of Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, he followed Purple Moon Emperor for so many years and he was unusually capable himself and could easily deal with him.

But then, the spear… The terrifying spear that ignored spacetime shook Qian Mingzi and his face grew grave.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and Qian Mingzi blocked the spear at the most crucial moment. However, the terrifying impact contained in the spear instantly pushed Qian Mingzi backward.

As he retreated, Emperor God Tian Ling attacked again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Three continuous spears shot out and they blossomed in the void. Every single spear was accompanied along an exotic beast’s roar.

The void shattered and the three spear shadow appeared next to Qian Mingzi without any symptoms and aimed at him ferociously.

Qian Mingzi grew solemn. Although he was retreating and there was no working point.

He continued to put his techniques to play and forcibly blocked two spear shadows that almost hit his vital parts. The last remaining spear shadow wasn’t hindered but hit his chest.

The armor on the surface of Qian Mingzi’s body immediately appeared.

Hong!

A terrifying power rushed over.

“Poof!”

Qian Mingzi immediately spat a mouthful of blood, then his face grew pale.

His figure was retreating quickly from the impact.

Emperor God Tian Ling saw the scene from afar and his eyes turned cold. He gripped the spear in his hands again and intended to attack again.

But suddenly, there was a space tunnel that appeared behind him. Then, there were three rays of purple lights. They were three spears that contained fierce power and they were flying at him.

The three purple spears were naturally assistance from Hall Master Yuan, who was hidden in the depth of the galaxy.

Due to the influence of the three purple spears, Emperor God Tian Ling’s action was delayed by a slight bit and he couldn’t continue to hunt Qian Mingzi.

After Qian Mingzi had steadied himself, he moved and his figure appeared next to Jian Wushuang.
