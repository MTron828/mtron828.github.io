Chapter 798: Blood Battle Arena

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After entering the shop, the handsome young man, Su Ming, walked quickly towards its interior, where a bald elder bearing a thundercloud mark between his eyes quietly sat cross-legged.

“Master,” Su Ming greeted him respectfully.

“Elder Lei Xin,” the two guards also addressed him courteously.

Lei Xin nodded to them, and turned his eyes on Su Ming. “Where have you been?”

“I’ve just been wandering the streets nearby, Master,” Su Ming answered with a forced smile.

Lei Xin’s face abruptly darkened. “Humph, I’ve warned you several times not to stay out of my sight for this period, but have you actually been listening?” he reprimanded Su Ming coldly.

Su Ming frowned and argued, “Master, it’s just Jian Wushuang. This is Cercis Island. Unless he is a fool, he would know the consequences of fighting on the island. Furthermore, I have two Protectors with me. He doesn’t have the ability to kill me even if he finds me.”

“There’s still a risk. Lei Yan told me that although Jian Wushuang may only be a Divine Realm expert, his strength is so extraordinary that even he, an expert at Step Three of the Eternal Realm, was frightened. If Jian Wushuang does try to assassinate you, I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape,” Lei Xin said in a deep tone.

“A Divine Realm expert had frightened an expert at Step Three of the Eternal Realm? Do you really believe that, Master?” Su Ming sneered.

Lei Xin squinted and looked, deep in thought.

The gap between the Divine Realm and the Eternal Realm was huge.

It was impressive for a Divine Realm expert to match an ordinary Eternal Realm expert. Such a Divine Realm expert could be regarded as the strongest Divine Realm expert.

It was almost impossible for a Divine Realm expert to be stronger than an expert at Step Three of the Eternal Realm.

In any case, Lei Xin had never seen or even heard of such a mighty expert before.

“It’s always wise to play safe,” Lei Xin told Su Ming gravely. He glanced at the two guards beside Su Ming and ordered, “You two have to follow him closely.”

“Yes, Elder Lei Xin, rest assured. We will stay close to Master Su Ming,” one of the two guards promised.

“Good,” Lei Xin nodded and turned to Su Ming. “Always take with you the thing I gave you. Never remove it or put it in your Interspatial Ring. If you are really in danger, it could save your life.”

“I got it, Master,” Su Ming nodded deferentially.

“You can leave now,” Lei Xin said and waved them away. Su Ming and his two guards left immediately.

The bald elder Lei Xin continued to sit there quietly as he watched Su Ming’s retreating figure. He shook his head silently.

Lei Xin was born without any family. He grew up alone in adversity, joined the Universal Thunder Sect and eventually became the Sect Master. He had always been alone, with no master or disciple.

The opportunity he had left in the Ancient World had been obtained by Su Ming. The latter, like him, was a man who would do anything to attain his goal. Therefore, he had accepted Su Ming as his disciple.

It was not easy for him to get a disciple so he valued Su Ming very much.

After leaving Lei Xin, Su Ming and his two guards emerged from the shop and walked to the next street.

Jian Wushuang had been watching them from the tavern in silence. He had no intention of taking action.

“The Sect Master Lei Xin really treasures his disciple. He actually arranged for two Eternal Realm experts to be Su Ming’s guards. Hmph, he deserves to be one of the Guest Elders of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion,”?Jian Wushuang’s lips were pressed into a thin smile. He continued to drink in solitude.

He had read Lei Xin’s information carefully. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Lei Xin had left the Firmament Territory, he had only been at Step Four of the Eternal Realm. As he wandered, his strength had grown. Now, he was at Step Five of the Eternal Realm, and had even broken through to the top of this step. In a nutshell, he was extremely powerful.

Most importantly, Lei Xin was a Guest Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion.

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion was a force to be reckoned with in Cercis Island.

On this island, the most exalted one was surely the Lord of Cercis Island and his Cercis Army.

In addition to the Lord of Cercis Island, there were six forces that were entrenched on Cercis Island.

All the six forces were under the command of the lord. Usually, they operated as separate entities. They had a long history and were very strong. They were said to have Dao Masters’ as their backers.

And the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion was one of the six forces.

As a Guest Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion, Lei Xin had an extraordinary position in the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. He now ran nearly a third of the shops belonging to them.

“Su Ming’s Master is not just an expert at the peak of Step Five of the Eternal Realm, but also a Guest Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. And Su Ming is protected by two Eternal Realm guards. We’re also on Cercis Island, so I’d have a lot of trouble killing him,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were narrowed, but he didn’t look anxious at all.

“Well, l’ll leave him alone for now. I’ll go to the Blood Battle Arena first and try to get a Cercis Token. I have the privilege of killing people on this island only with a Cercis Token.”

With this in mind, Jian Wushuang emptied his cup, and then checked out before leaving the tavern.

The Blood Battle Arena was at the very center of Cercis Island and was situated underground.

When Jian Wushuang arrived at the Blood Battle Arena, the scene of madness before him took his breath away.

Jian Wushuang had been to a similar place in the Ancient World. He was a teenager at the time, and he had gone to the Gladiator arena to participate in duels to get more Spirit-cultivating Pills. The Gladiator arena also looked pretty crazy, but was nothing compared to the Blood Battle Arena.

The vast underground world had a radius of thousands of kilometers.

There were numerous seats, in which more than a million people sat, screaming wildly. But these people didn’t even fill a tenth of the seats in this underground world.

There were two huge arenas in the middle of the underground world. A fierce battle was currently taking place in one.

“Wow, wow, wow!!!”

“Oh, yes, fight!!!”

The exclamations, screams and howls drowned out the fighting at the arena.

“That’s really crazy!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked at the scene. He took a seat and watched the fight in the arena.

The two fighters were clearly superior Divine Realm experts and both were formidable.
