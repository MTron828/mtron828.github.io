Chapter 3163: Return to the Temporal Temple

_____________

“Hmph!”

“Hmph!”

Two muffled groans sounded at the same time. The two Principles Masters were obviously injured.

But even though they were injured, their footsteps did not stop at all. They did not even dare to turn their heads.

“I’m in a good mood today, so I’ll spare your lives. Go back and tell that Sorcerer God of yours to not have any designs on this little fellow in the future. Otherwise, our Temporal Temple won’t mind letting him have another taste of being a stray dog.” Ba Cang’s deep voice reverberated in the world.

Most of the people around did not hear Ba Cang’s last words, but when the two rule masters heard it, their bodies trembled and they fled even faster.

As the two Principles Masters disappeared from everyone’s sight, the space-time seal around the Mountain Thunder Fort was naturally lifted.

Ba Cang’s figure flashed and he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Looking at Ba Cang, Jian Wushuang immediately recalled the scene where he killed the red-haired handsome man with one finger. He was shocked and immediately bowed. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, greetings, Lord Ba Cang!”

Jian Wushuang was naturally grateful to Ba Cang.

After all, if it were not for Ba Cang, he would only have been able to resolve the crisis by using the two pearls.

Now that Ba Cang had chased away the three rule masters, he naturally kept the two pearls as his trump card.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was also quite curious.

He had indeed cultivated the spacetime divine skill and could be considered a member of the spacetime temple, but he had never made any contact with the spacetime temple, so how could the people of the spacetime temple know of his existence, moreover, he had specially sent such a powerful Principles Master to save him?

“Little guy, come with me,” Ba Cang said.

“Where are we going?” Jian Wushuang raised his head in confusion.

“Back to the spacetime temple, of course. Where else can we go?” Ba Cang laughed.

“But I…” Jian Wushuang was still a little hesitant.

“What, you don’t want to go to the spacetime temple?” Ba Cang looked over.

“Of course not. I wasn’t prepared at all. Moreover, I’m in a terrible situation. Even the three Saint Realms have their eyes on me. If I go to the Temporal Temple, I’m afraid I’ll bring great trouble to the Temporal Temple,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Trouble?”

“Haha, you’re underestimating my Temporal Temple. In the Divine Beginning Realm, my Temporal Temple can do whatever it wants. Even the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect fear my temporal temple. As for the three Saint Realms, they wouldn’t dare to attack my Temporal Temple.” Ba Cang was very confident.

“Don’t worry. You are a member of the Temporal Temple. We will protect you and won’t let anyone bully you, not even the three Saint Realms. Let’s go.”

Ba Cang no longer cared whether Jian Wushuang agreed or not. He grabbed Jian Wushuang’s arm.

Whoosh!

A gust of wind blew past, and the two disappeared into the void.

Many cultivators of the mountain thunder fort were still standing around. Even when they saw Ba Cang and Jian Wushuang disappear, they did not come back to their senses.

After a long time, the Lord of the Mountain Thunder Fort finally woke up.

“Good Lord, a Principles Master was killed on the spot?”

“I didn’t expect such a big battle to happen in my small Mountain Thunder Fort, and a Principles Master was killed…tsk tsk!”

“Temporal Temple, Ba Cang? I’ve never heard of him, but he’s a super existence now. Master might know him.”

…

They were miles away from the Mountain Thunder Fort.

Whoosh!

Two figures appeared out of thin air. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After Jian Wushuang appeared, he looked at his surroundings in astonishment.

The surrounding environment was obviously different from the Mountain Thunder Fort. Jian Wushuang was sure that he was very far away from the Mountain Thunder Fort, but it only took a moment.

“Is this…teleportation?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Yes, it’s teleportation.” Ba Cang looked over, he smiled and said, “When you have reached the fourth stage of comprehending space-time principles, you can master teleportation. Your current realm is still relatively low. Although your comprehension of space-time rules is not bad, you are still far from the fourth stage. But don’t worry. When you return to the space-time temple, there are a lot of space-time cultivation resources in the temple. With your talent, you can easily reach the fourth stage.”

Hearing this, Jian wushuang smiled bitterly.

At first, he did not want to go to the time and space temple, but seeing Ba Cang, he was afraid that he would have to fly there.

However, Jian Wushuang did not dislike going to the Temporal Temple.

After all, the Temporal Temple mainly focused on the space-time rules. There were a large number of experts who had reached the peak of space-time research, as well as a variety of space-time secret skills. They already knew how to use the space-time principles, these were all things that Jian Wushuang looked forward to.

It was different from the Heaven-cleaving Star of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

The cultivation resources on the Heaven-cleaving Star only had a great effect on some weaker True Saints. However, the stronger they were, the weaker the effect would be. With Jian Wushuang’s current strength, it would be difficult for him to get a great opportunity to go to the Heaven-cleaving Star, however, many cultivation resources in the Temporal Temple were very useful to him.

“Little guy, let’s keep going. It’s still far from here to the Temporal Temple.”

Ba Cang smiled, grabbed Jian Wushuang’s arm, and began to teleport again.

…

At the bottom of the huge abyss.

There was no sunlight. Everything was pitch-black and pitch-black.

In the middle of the vast, dark hall, a hazy, dark figure condensed on the throne.

Below, Heart Sect and the demonic old man, Void Master, knelt there in extreme fear. They lowered their heads, not daring to look directly at the person on the throne.

“Failed?”

A low and somewhat hoarse voice came out from the mouth of the dark figure. “The prophet endured the price of the Principles of Fate’s backlash. It wasn’t easy to find the location of that little fellow. After that, I asked the three of you to capture that little fellow alive, but in the end, you three Principles Masters joined hands and not only did you fail to bring the little fellow back, but on the contrary, one of you even died?”

“Such trash, what use do I have for you?”

His voice was filled with anger and killing intent as it rose up in the great hall, scaring Xin Zong and void master so much that their expressions changed.

“Lord Sorcerer God,” Xin Zong said, “the three of us have indeed tried our best, but that level four true saint named Heavenly Sword Marquis is truly strange. Not only can he rely on his divine power to recover his soul, but his divine power is also as vast as the sea. The three of us have defeated his divine body nearly fifty times, yet his divine power has barely been used up by more than half!”

“And before we could completely exhaust his divine power, the Azure Overlord of the temporal temple had arrived!”
