Chapter 1800: Ancient Expert

The power of one finger could shatter the Eight Divine Mountain that Jian Wushuang had performed with all his strength and continue to hit Jian Wushuang’s body. Its impact made Jian Wushuang retreat ten thousand miles away.

The power of the finger could be well imagined.

“You didn’t die?” Dao Yuanzi looked at Jian Wushuang with interest, “It seems like not only did your divine power reach middle stage Chaotic Realm, but the same also goes to your divine body.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

“Dao Yuanzi was only a Sir God, how could he be so powerful?” Jian Wushuang grew solemn.

It was true. Dao Yuanzi was too powerful.

He was definitely the scariest Sir God that Jian Wushuang had ever seen, far stronger than any Sir Gods he met before. Even Emperor God Xue Go and Emperor God Tian Xiao didn’t strike Jian Wushuang with such ferocity.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t belittle your opponent. Don’t forget that he is an expert from ancient times,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang ‘s heart skipped a beat.

Yes, an expert from ancient times!

“The powerful and prosperous ancient times is beyond comparison to the Eternal Chaotic World that you’re in now. Back in ancient times, there were many experts and countless geniuses. With the number of experts, they naturally created many secret skills and they were all ridiculously strong. The person named Dao Yuanzi in front of you should be far beyond an Emperor God when he is at his peak. He could only be stronger, not weaker when compared with a Great Emperor!”

“Although his power has only recovered to the level of Sir God, the techniques that he has, such as secret skills, unique skills, and comprehension of doctrines, are definitely at the Great Emperor level or even higher. With this factor alone, his overall power will be much stronger than ordinary Emperor God’s.”

“Hence, don’t belittle him and don’t compete with him in terms of close combat skills. You won’t be his match. The best way is to utilize all your trump cards and suppress him with power and strength,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Suppress with power and strength? I happen to share the same idea,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Whatever King of Venomous Worms said, he thought about too.

An expert from ancient times, even if he could only give play to the strength of Sir God level, his fighting power was definitely not measured according to an ordinary Sir God level.

Then, Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate but flipped his palm and a scroll painting appeared in his hand.

As Jian Wushuang threw the scroll painting into the void, there was a beautiful and boundless scroll painting world that appeared in the sky above.

A boundless aura spread down from the scroll painting world.

“Dao Yuanzi, you should be very familiar with this scene, right?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course I am. Over fifty thousand years ago, you used this treasure to kill my Blood Devil clone. Back then, I thought your treasure would be just an ordinary Chaos Divine Treasure. But from what it seems, it isn’t that simple,” Dao Yuanzi squinted his eyes as he looked at the sky above. He could feel a supreme aura from the scroll painting world.

“Humph, then you should feel the power of this treasure again today.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. As he spoke, there was a lofty continent that extended from the scroll painting world.

Nine-province second seal, Hack the Earth, suddenly descended!

“This aura…” Dao Yuanzi’s face grew grave. Just as the lofty continent descended, he felt a familiar aura. The aura dated back to many years ago during the ancient war, when he had felt a similar aura.

“I remember now. This treasure is River Mountain Map!”

“It’s Seven Star Black Sect’s River Mountain Map. You’re Seven Star Black Sect’s man?”

Dao Yuanzi looked at Jian Wushuang with a horrified look. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Seven Star Black Sect was the main participant in the ancient war. They were also one of the overlords in ancient times.

An ancient and powerful sect, even Dao Yuanzi was fearful.

But suddenly, Dao Yuanzi shook his head vigorously, “No way, it’s impossible that you’re Seven Star Black Sect’s man. Seven Star Black Sect should have been destroyed in the ancient war back then. Even if they survived by sheer luck… To be able to survive the war back then, one’s power would definitely be above your level. You must have gotten this River Mountain Map by luck, it is definitely so.”

Dao Yuanzi instantly believed in his judgment.

In the sky, the lofty continent descended and pressed on him. He smirked coldly, “Hehe, although the treasure is great, you must be able to give full play to its power. Watch me as I withstand your move and kill you next to get this treasure.”

Dao Yuanzi chuckled coldly and there was a thick, crimson fog that soared up from his body. At the same time, he lifted his hands and moved his fingers as though he was playing a string musical instrument.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

There was a total of ten crimson lights that burst out. It almost hit the lofty continent that was descending instantly.

The bottom of the lofty continent was immediately pierced and there were ten holes. Then, the entire continent started to collapse.

Hack the Earth that Jian Wushuang had performed with all his strength was shattered by Dao Yuanzi easily.

“Hehe, Seven Star Black Sect’s River Mountain Map, this treasure is wasted in your hands,” Dao Yuanzi sneered.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised by what happened. His divine power revolved madly and continued to flow into the sky above.

“Dao Yuanzi, isn’t it too early to celebrate?”

A loud roar reverberated in the universe. Then, Jian Wushuang slapped a few palm prints in the sky above.

Rumble. The universe shook and a brand new continent descended.

The continent was much bigger than the one before and the power was obviously much stronger.

Nine-province seal, the Third Move, Yang Province as the seal, was called “Overwhelm the Rain!”

Ever since Jian Wushuang had broken through and become a third stage Ultimate Real God, his overall power had increased tremendously and his divine power had transformed completely. Hence, he finally got to perform this move.

In terms of power, Overwhelm the Rain was a few times stronger than the second move, Hack The Earth!

At that moment, Overwhelm the Rain descended and the billowing pressure pressed the void. The entire void started shaking vigorously.

Looking at the scene, Dao Yuanzi was surprised but he wasn’t concerned. “Much stronger than the earlier move, but that’s it?”

“Don’t be in a hurry,” Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips. As he spoke, he suddenly patted in-between his eyebrows with his right hand.

Bang! Bang!

Two Ancient God stars broke apart instantly.

Secret skill of Ancient God, Star Destruction Skill!

An Ancient God would use this skill in the last critical moment when he went all out. It was also one of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards.

The more Ancient God stars an Ancient God broke, the more his power would increase in a short time. However, it would be more difficult to recover after as well.
