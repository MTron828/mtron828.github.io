Chapter 1259: Extermination Mission!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the camp.

Jian Wushuang, Second Divine General Lin Dong and Fifth Divine General Mo You headed a team.

“Jian Wushuang, you just arrived at Nine Star Sea, so we should have held a welcome feast for you. However, you just got a mission, so we have to delay the feast. Now, let me explain the mission to you,” Lin Dong said.

Jian Wushuang listened carefully.

“The big commander said it was an extermination mission,” Ling Dong said.

“Extermination mission?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “Who will be exterminated?”

“The big commander said it was an extermination mission,” Ling Dong said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew what the Red Water Alliance was. It was a powerful force in the Dayu World.

Based on what he knew, although this alliance was not as good as the Three Hegemons, it ranked right behind them. In the Red Water Alliance, there were six Universe Gods. Even though none of them were Second Heaven Universe Gods, they were also very powerful.

Now, they three had to exterminate this alliance?

How?

“Don’t worry, Jian Wushuang. Although the Red Water Alliance sounds very strong, it has become history,” Ling Dong laughed and said reassuringly.

“History?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Ling Dong looked at Mo You, and then Mo You said, “Not long ago, while the Red Water Alliance was having a fierce battle with the Golden-sun Sect in our Scarlet Island, they sneakily attacked us but failed. The Master of Scarlet Island was furious, so he led a group of Universe Gods to attack their lair and wiped out all the advanced battle strength in the alliance!”

“The six Universe Gods and some stronger Universe Masters were all killed. Now, there are only some ordinary Universe Masters and Holy Masters in it, so it is a good time for us the exterminate them and take over their area.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang understood.

If Red Water Alliance were at its peak, they three would defintely be killed when they battled with them.

However, since the alliance lost their advanced battle strength, it would be much easier.

“No wonder Man Yi commander said it was a simple task. After losing the advanced battle strength, even though there are still many Universe Masters and Dao Masters in the Red Water Alliance, it has become an empty shell.” Jian Wushuang slightly smiled.

“Although this task is not difficult, the Red Water Alliance still occupies a vast area. We have to break through the cities one by one, so it will take us a long time. Let’s confirm the people first. The Second Army and Fifth Army have already got another task, so they can’t help. You have to assign the Seventh Army to join this battle,” Lin Dong said and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m afraid that you haven’t got a chance to meet your sergeants in the Seventh Army so far. Let us take you there.”

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He was the Seventh Divine General and in charge of the Seventh Army.

Soon, Lin Dong and Mo You led him to meet his sergeants in the Seventh Army.

Half a day later, Jian Wushuang, the Second Divine General Lin Dong and the Fifth Divine General Mo You set out with the sergeants from the Seventh Army.

There were 30,000 people in one army in Scarlet Island.

Among them, the weakest ones were Holy Masters, and the captains were usually Universe Masters.

The battle formation of this army was terrifying in the Eternal World, but in the Eternal Chaotic World and the Dayu Region, it was not a big deal.

After all, there were numerous Holy Masters and Universe Masters here.

Therefore, Holy Masters were not very valuable.

In half a month, Jian Wushuang led the Seventh Army to in the first city that was controlled by the Red Water Alliance.

The mighty army stopped in front of the giant city.

“This is the first city that we need to exterminate, but there are numerous inner cultivators in it. While we are killing, how can we recognize which experts belong to the Red Water Alliance?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

“Don’t worry about that. We will kill all the cultivators in the city!” Lin Dong shook his head, and a hint of Killing Intent flashed in his eyes.

“What? Kill all the people?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Seventh Divine General, it seems you are new in the Eternal Chaotic World, so you don’t really know how cruel it is.”

Lin Dong and Mo You both smiled. They could understand Jian Wushuang’s reaction.

When they just got here from their hometowns, they both were stunned when they realized how monstrous the Eternal Chaotic World was.

“Jian Wushuang, you just arrived at Nine Star Sea, so we should have held a welcome feast for you. However, you just got a mission, so we have to delay the feast. Now, let me explain the mission to you,” Lin Dong said.

“Jian Wushuang,” King Gu’s voiced was suddenly sounded, “when you were in the Green Fire World, I already told you that you couldn’t imagine how cruel the Eternal Chaotic World was. A mass killing in a city is just a small case. Before, when King Luo Zhen and I wandered here, we saw people slaughtering others from the Eternal World without any reason!”

“This is a small case. Often times, entire Realms or even Kingdoms are slaughtered.”

“A slaughter in a Realm or a Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

A Realm… Dayu World was a Realm. It was not only a giant land, but there were numerous people from the Eternal World staying here.

The Realm already included a great number of people. What about a Kingdom, which was formed by thousands of Fealms?

“The people who are confident to wander in the Eternal Chaotic World should be ready for it. Most of them have killed lots of people as well. After all, this is a place for experts, so none of the cultivators here are innocent!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s fine if you sympathize with the weak and don’t want to slaughter here, but you need to remember that you can’t hesitate when you have to kill them. Even though some of them are innocent, you must do it when it’s necessary!” King Gu said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at the two Divine Generals. “Besides launching a slaughter, do we have another choice?”

Lin Dong and Mo You looked at each other, and then Mo You said, “Seventh Divine General, don’t worry. Although Scarlet Island is effective, we are not like the evil ones who kill innocent people”
