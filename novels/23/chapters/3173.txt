“No.” Temple Master Bai Xing shook his head. “You can enter and leave the first level of the space-time tower at will, but you need some conditions to enter the second or third level.”

“What conditions?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Divine power,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“Divine power is a very special divine power. You’re only at the True Saint Realm, so you’re not qualified to touch it. However, to most Principles Masters in the Divine Beginning Realm, divine power is like a holy elixir, used to trade with each other,” Temple Master Bai Xing explained.

“Only Principles Masters have the right to brew divine power!”

“Little guy, you should know that after Principles Masters master a complete set of rules, they will have a special power of will. Because of this power of will, Principles Masters are much stronger than the Immortal Saints. For example, many Immortal Saints in the Divine Beginning Realm are so powerful that they are already invincible. Although they are invincible among the Immortal Saints, they are still far inferior to Principles Masters!”

“The reason is because of the existence of that will. Under normal circumstances, if a Principles Master comprehended two principles at the same time, he would be able to obtain two parts of the will, and his strength would naturally be stronger!”

“And the divine power is the special divine power that these Principles Masters, who have grasped the will power, condensed by relying on their own will power. This kind of divine power is nothing to many masters of Laws, but to the Immortal Saints, it is extremely powerful!”

“In the Divine Beginning Realm, the principles gate treats the divine power as an ordinary currency, but the Immortal Saints treat it as a treasure!”

“The Immortal Saints who are weaker can not guide the power even if they have the divine power. But for the Immortal Saints who have reached the peak of invincible strength, they can guide the power of will contained in the divine power to bring their strength to a higher level.”

“Divine power is so useful?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He did not expect that Principles Masters could use their will power to condense this special divine power.

And the divine power could help the Immortal Saints, who had reached the peak, increase their strength in a short period of time?

Jian Wushuang immediately understood how important the divine power was to the peak-level Immortal Saints.

“Of course, the divine power is important to the peak-level Immortal Saints, but experts from various forces in the Divine Beginning Realm have long reached a consensus that they would not freely give their condensed divine power to their experts or disciples,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“Firstly, they don’t want their subordinates or disciples to rely too much on the power of divine power, and secondly, there is a great risk in guiding the will power of divine power!” Temple Master Bai Xing said seriously.

“The Immortal Saint is not a Principles Master after all, so he can freely control the will power. Although a drop of divine power contains very little will power, even an Invincible Immortal Saint will suffer the backlash of the will power if he tries to guide it by force. He might die first, not to mention increasing his strength to kill the enemy!”

“Because of these two reasons, there are very few top-notch Immortal Saints in the Divine Beginning Realm who possess divine power. Even if they do, they only have one or two drops at most. It’s impossible for them to have too much.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

Divine power was a double-edged sword.

It could increase one’s strength at a critical moment, but it could also cause a backlash. Therefore, this kind of power was not very common in the Divine Beginning Realm.

“This divine power is very rare for the Immortal Saint, but it’s only a common thing for us Principles Masters. That’s why we use it as currency,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Use divine power as currency?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “Temple Master Bai Xing, if you say that every rule master in the absolute beginning divine realm can condense divine power through the power of their own will, doesn’t that mean that divine power is endless?”

“Endless? How can it be so exaggerated?”

Palace Master Bai Xing smiled. “Little guy, you have to understand first. Although Principles Masters can condense divine power, the process isn’t easy. Under normal circumstances, a Principles Master can only condense a drop of divine power after dozens or even hundreds of years. Moreover, the process of condensing divine power will affect the will power they control. That’s why few Principles Masters dare to use that will power to condense divine power.”

“Under normal circumstances, if a Principles Master wants to condense divine power, after concentrating on condensing a few drops of divine power, he would need to spend hundreds or even thousands of years to fully recover the power of the will before he can continue to condense the next batch. In this way, even if a Principles Master tries his best, he can at most condense 20 to 30 drops of divine power in 10,000 years.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

He had thought that it was easy for Principles Masters to condense divine power, but now it seemed that it was not so.

Naturally, the divine power would not be too overflowed.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, in the Divine Beginning Realm, how many holy elixirs does a drop of divine power cost in exchange for holy elixirs?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Exchange? No way.” Temple Master Bai Xing shook his head. “In the Divine Beginning Realm, the superior Principles Masters use divine power to trade with each other, so they don’t use holy elixirs at all. Holy elixirs are useless to Principles Masters. Therefore, no matter how many holy elixirs they give, they can’t exchange for a drop of divine power from a Principles Master. Of course, some sects have a way to exchange for divine power in order to provide convenience for their experts.”

“In my Temporal Temple, if you want to exchange for divine power, you can exchange 10 billion holy elixirs for one drop.”

“10 billion?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened. “Why is it so expensive?”

Expensive, indeed expensive!

After all, even if he exchanged the universe crystals from Xue Bei for holy elixirs, they were only worth 7.5 billion holy elixirs.

Xue Bei was also a Principles Master, and he was very powerful. He even went to the universe battlefield. However, Xue Bei obviously valued the universe crystals more than divine power..
