Chapter 1346: The Real Genius!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Purple Martens fled and the crisis was over.

On the spaceship, everyone was still in a shock and had yet to come back to reality.

They were all astonished by Duan Lingfeng’s five incredible strokes.

The five strokes were too terrifying…

“Jian Wushuang, you have come across a real genius,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“A real genius? Duan Lingfeng?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“It’s him,” King of Venomous Worms sounded rather serious, “If I didn’t sense it wrongly, Dean Lingfeng should be quite badly injured. To be more accurate, he was poisoned, and that caused him to be unable to give full play to his power. Otherwise, he could have killed the five three-marked Purple Martens long ago.”

“Badly injured?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He was badly injured, power severely hindered, but he still could kill five three-marked Purple Marten in an instant?

“Don’t find it strange. Duan Lingfeng is really impressive. If he wasn’t badly injured, if he didn’t just pass through God’s Test and his divine power wasn’t just starting to transform, forget about the five three-marked Purple Marten, even in the entire Eternal Chaotic World, he could definitely be unrivaled among the countless Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven!”

“He has such ability!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“In the Eternal Chaotic World, among countless Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, he could be unrivaled?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“He is a real genius. Even in the vast expanse of the Eternal Chaotic World, he’s the top super genius. He is totally different from those geniuses you met in Snow Dojo, Snow Kingdom. Those geniuses would only be qualified to carry his shoes for him,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Of course, although Duan Lingfeng is the real genius, you’re not that much weaker than him.

Jian Wushuang heard that, and there was a surge of emotions.

King of Venomous Worms was experienced and knowledgeable. For him to give such high compliments Duan Lingfeng must be really impressive.

Before everyone’s shocked gaze, Duan Lingfeng retrieved his saber and came to the spaceship. He came before Luo Yu and Luo Hai.

“Yu, Hai, are you okay?” Duan Lingfeng asked.

“We’re okay.” Luo Yu shook her head.

“It’s Brother Wushuang that saved us,” Luo Hai immediately added.

Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you,” Duan Lingfeng expressed his gratitude.

“Don’t mention it. What’s more, if it wasn’t for you killing the five three-marked Purple Martens, I’m afraid no one in our troop could have escaped. It should be us who thank you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Duan Lingfeng nodded faintly, but didn’t say anything else.

The Universe Gods on the spaceship finally came back to reality and slowly recovered.

Their troop lost quite a few Universe Gods in the fight earlier and there were many that were injured.

Besides, the surrounding set up on the spaceship was broken. Yu Shan had to repair it.

When the recovery work was almost done, the spaceship continued its journey.

In the corner of the spaceship, Jian Wushuang lay alone.

Swoosh!

A wine pot was thrown directly at Jian Wushuang and he caught it with ease.

“Let’s have a drink together,” Duan Lingfeng took a seat. He had a wine pot in his hand too.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows but he didn’t refuse.

“Luckily you saved Yu and Hai in time today. Otherwise, I would be too embarrassed to see Brother Luo Yan,” Duan Lingfeng said coldly.

“Brother Luo Yan?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Brother Luo Yan is their father. He’s my best friend!” Duan Lingfeng said, “Not long ago when I was undergoing my God’s Test in the Third Heaven, my enemy suddenly came to look for me. Brother Luo Yan fought alone against three Universe God in the Third Heaven fully aware that he wasn’t their match in order to stop them from bothering me. In the end, I passed my God’s Test but Brother Luo Yan died in my enemy’s hand!”

“It can be said that I owe Brother Luo Yan my life!”

Jian Wushuang heard and secretly admired Brother Luo Yan in the story.

He knew that he wasn’t the enemy’s match but in order to not let them bother his best friend’s God Test, he blocked the three Universe Gods in the Third Heaven forcefully until he sacrificed himself!

The friendship ran really deep!

“Before Brother Luo Yan died, he told me to send Yu and Hai back to his hometown, Imperial World. I must send them back to his hometown regardless of my life. But now…” Duan Lingfeng shook his head as he blamed himself.

If it wasn’t because of Jian Wushuang, Luo Yu and Luo Hai might really be dead.

“If I’m not mistaken, you should be quite heavily injured, huh?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You can tell?” Duan Lingfeng looked surprised.

“You must be quite badly injured and it is affecting your fighting power. Otherwise, you could have killed the few three-marked Purple Martens right at the beginning,” Jian Wushuang said.

“True,” Duan Lingfeng nodded, “I am poisoned by my enemy and I can’t use too much of my power. I killed the few three-marked Purple Martens at the risk of poison spreading to my heart.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was shocked and said, “What kind of poison is that? I might have a way to cure it for you.”

Speaking of antidotes, Jian Wushuang was an expert on them.

“It’s okay,” Duan Lingfeng shook his head, “I have kept the poison under control. Give me some time. In less than a hundred years, I will be able to clear the poison.”

“If so, why didn’t you clear the poison first before you come to Ancient Star Sea?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

Ancient Star Sea, just how dangerous was it?

He had yet to recover to his peak and he had brought two Universe Masters to Ancient Star Sea.

Isn’t this too risky?

“I have no choice because my enemy is coming after me. I have to leave immediately,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Duan Lingfeng suddenly looked over as he also knew Jian Wushuang’s name.

“I saw you killing ten over Purple Martens with one stroke. You are quite strong,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“I’m not up to your par,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“If I’m not mistaken, the reason why you want to go through the Ancient Star Sea is to head to the legendary Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, right?” Duan Lingfeng asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries…” There was a spark that appeared in Duan Lingfeng’s eyes, “The legend says that there are countless geniuses and experts. It’s a pity that I still have tasks on hand. Otherwise, I’d go there too. I’d like to see what sort of monsters there are in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!”
