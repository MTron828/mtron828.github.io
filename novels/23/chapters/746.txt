Chapter 747: The Mind-controlling Secret Skill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Whirr—”

It seemed as if the Void had been hacked open, and a raspy wind-breaking sound broke in.

The sound blasted into Jian Wushuang’s face, but he stood rooted in place like an unshakable mountain.

“This guy has already produced his Saber Heart. He is much more powerful than Luo Ao. Yet, he has merely accomplished Step One of the Eternal Realm.”

Jian Wushuang murmured to himself. He hoisted his Emperor Sword up in the air, and half of the Sword Heart power from his sea of consciousness was instantly released.

When he killed Luo Ao, he had only used a tenth of his Sword Heart power. But now, he was directly unleashing half of its power.

“Secret Skill, the Netherworld!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone. He thrust out his Emperor Sword without mercy, casting out his strongest offensive Secret Skill.

“Whoosh!”

A bright sword light shot out.

In an instant, the climate changed drastically.

The Void in his vicinity started to tremble.

“Boom!”

A deafening rumble suddenly broke out.

The saber that the white-haired elder was holding was also an Eternal Weapon. He used it to its full capacity. In addition, the move he performed was his strongest saber move. This attack should have been overbearing. However, when it collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword light—

“Splat!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood. He lost his balance and was forced to take a few steps back under the impact of the bombarding power.

“I’m at Step One of the Eternal Realm. How could I, a Divine Realm expert, get crushed by a Demon God? And, he hasn’t even turned into a Demon God!” The elder was shocked, unable to believe what had just happened.

What the elder did not know was that though Jian Wushuang was merely at the level of Divine Realm expert, the skill he had practiced was the defiant Heavenly Creation Skill.

He had a flawless foundation, and his explosive force was stronger than any Divine Realm expert of the same rank to begin with. And most importantly, he also practiced the Star-river Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan and had reached the 11th Level, so his power amplitude was 33 times higher than most people.

As for most experts in the Eternal Realm, such as the white-haired elder and Luo Ao, their power amplitude could reach 10 times that of others, at most.

Despite the fact that Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Realm expert, in light of his pure power, he would absolutely not lose to anyone in the Eternal Realm. He might even overpower them!

Besides, Jian Wushuang had already reached Level Two of Sword Heart cultivation. He had stayed at this level for 20 years, which meant he had long since climbed to the peak of Level Two.

The only thing he lacked was comprehension of the Origin Dao. But he was only a few inches away, the gap was easy to narrow.

In other words, putting aside his current swordsmanship and Secret Skills, his battle strength was at Step Two of the Eternal Realm.

If he went all out and transformed into a Gold-armored Ancient God, he wouldn’t even fear Step Three Eternal Realm experts.

This was the strength Jian Wushuang had attained in the Eternal Zone through 100 years of earnest cultivation and countless fierce battles.

A Divine Realm expert, without transforming into a Gold-armored Ancient God, he was already on par with someone at the peak of Step Two of the Eternal Realm. This was incredible for a human being.

However, given that he had practiced the Heavenly Creation Skill, his current phase—the Deification Realm—was a phase in which his battle strength could be limitless.

His battle strength could go completely beyond normal people’s expectations.

Accordingly, when dealing with the white-haired elder at Step One of the Eternal Realm, even without employing his full power, he could still butcher him easily with only half of his strength!

“Run, quickly run!” When the purple-clothed lady saw this scenario, she was thunderstruck as well. She let out a series of shouts and fled to the Void.

“Run!” The white-haired elder also lost his composure rushed to escape.

Although the strength Jian Wushuang just demonstrated utterly astonished them, they still had some assurance about making a successful flee.

After all, though men from the Ancient God Clan tended to excel at using power and defending themselves, they were not good at moving quickly. And their survival skills were also less brilliant.

The two fleeing were both from the Eternal Realm of the Immortal Dynasty. Their survival skills were quite good.

Actually, there were many experts from various Sects in the Firmament Territory who possessed unique survival skills. Precisely for this reason, the two had dared to step into the Eternal Zone.

Even if they bumped into a Demon God that they had no way of defeating, they still had the chance to run away.

However, these two had obviously underestimated Jian Wushuang’s capabilities.

“Escape? Can you really escape?” Jian Wushuang bellowed. Killing intent was raging in his eyes.

If the experts who had broken into the Eternal Zone were from the top Sects, perhaps Jian Wushuang would have had mercy and left his opponents a way out.

After all, in the battle a century ago, the top Sects had not attacked him.

If they had not been under the leadership of the three magnates, the whole thing would have been different.

“As long as I can, I won’t let any of the three magnates’ men get out of here alive,” Jian Wushuang said, fixing his cold eyes on the white-haired elder who had just fought against him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Between the two of you, I can only kill one. And I pick you!”

Jian Wushuang held out his palm and threw a handprint in the direction of the fleeing elder. A shot of strange energy rose up.

“Ancient God’s Secret Skill, Mind-controlling!”

“Buzz—” An odd energy flooded out, immediately flinging itself at the elder.

As he was running for his life, the elder noticed the weird energy oozing out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

“What the hell?!”

The elder’s expression altered slightly. He had no idea what this odd energy was. But it caught up with him in no time and enveloped him completely.

The elder turned pale with fright. He attempted to react, but a fit of fierce pain gripped him.

This pain was so strong that he could not bear it. He let out an involuntary wail and instantly stopped in his tracks.

He stood in the Void, his hands clutching his head. His mind stopped working.

Of course, the pain he felt only lasted a split second. Soon, he regained his senses. He looked up. A jet of chilling sword light was millimeters from his neck. The tip of the sword was sinking into this throat.

“No!”

He only had time to let out his last cry before Jian Wushuang chopped his head off, as if cutting a piece of paper. The sharp power concealed in the Sword Edge penetrated his body and shattered his Life Core.

Once the Life Core was crushed, even an expert in the Eternal Realm would die on the spot.

With one hand on his Emperor Sword, Jian Wushuang watched the already dead elder fall to the ground with a note of aloofness.

“It’s a pity I’m still in a relatively low phase. The Mind-controlling Secret Skill I cast only influenced him for a second. If I was in the same phase as him, his mind might have collapsed directly. Or maybe I would have killed him simply with the Mind-controlling Secret Skill.”
