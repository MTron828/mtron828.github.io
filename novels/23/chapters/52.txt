Chapter 53: Jian Wushuang Showing His Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Since all of you have agreed, let’s go,” said the sturdy man, as a chilling smile appeared on his face. Then he quickly turned around and disappeared into the corridor with his companions, leaving Jian Wushuang and the other two to fight with the pack of Tianhuan Sect disciples.

“Bastards!”

“Damn it!”

Seeing that, Yin Min and Ling Tianhao cursed in rage with a peevish expression on their faces.

“This is troublesome.” Jian Wushuang also felt a little worried.

Including those four, along with Jian Wushuang, Yin Min and Ling Tianhao, if these seven Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm masters fought together, they would easily defeat these Tianhuan Sect disciples. However, with those four leaving, the remaining three had to fight with five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples, a dozen Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Initial Spiritual Sea Realm Tianhuan Sect disciples.

The situation was instantly at its worst.

“Haha, your companions seem to have abandoned you.”

“Poor guys, prepare to get trashed.”

All the disciples of the Tianhuan Sect laughed at Jian Wushuang and the other two, lunging at them directly.

“Swordsman, Haozi (Mouse), Let’s fight!” Yin Min shouted to Jian Wushuang and desperately rushed into the battlefield.

“I’ll take three Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples. I’ll count on you to handle the rest two, several Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Initial Realm disciples,” Yin Min said in a deep voice. It was her ultimate limit to fight with three Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples at the same time.

“Let me take these five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples.” Jian Wushuang’s words surprised Yin Min. Before she could reply, Jian Wushuang ran in front her with amazing speed and collided with the Tianhuan Sect disciples.

Whoosh!

Suddenly a bright dazzling sword light swept across the five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples simultaneously.

“What?”

“How dare he fight with all five of us at the same time? He must be suicidal!”

“Kill him!”

Those five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples became furious and lunged towards Jian Wushuang.

But when the dazzling sword light swept, zooming, the horrible Sword Essence rose suddenly and sharply.

“Watch out!”

The five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples hurriedly changed from attack to defense. But when they came into contact with the sword light, these five figures fell back with five loud thumps.

Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop!

The wild sword shadows almost instantaneously spurted from Jian Wushuang’s hands. The amazing speed of Aurora Swordsmanship had soared to an incredible level ever since Jian Wushuang comprehended the Sword Essence of Gale.

“It’s so fast!”

“Amazing!”

“Be careful!”

The Tianhuan disciples shouted with voices full of fear. Although the five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples tried their best to withstand the sword shadows, the sword shadows were too fast and arrived too quickly.

Even though the sword shadows swept to five of them at the same time, it was still too fast to resist.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sounds of clanks were heard one after another. The five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples were hit by dozens of sword attacks, and three of them seemed to be unable to parry. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Beep… A sword Flash swept towards the throat of those three disciples.

“Chi!”

The three figures immediately fell backward.

“Damn it!”

“Run!”

Seeing that, the Tianhuan Sect disciples began escaping crazily with almost no hesitation. The two remaining Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples also lost the courage to fight with Jian Wushuang. The only thing they could do was run.

“He’s too strong. Even with five of us together, his swordsmanship was so fast that he killed three of us in the blink of an eye. We’ll all die here if we do not run.” The two Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples were aware of the insurmountable gap between Jian Wushuang and them. Naturally, they did not dare to fight with Jian Wushuang anymore.

“Run?” A cold voice without a hint of emotion rang out near one of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples. The disciple raised his head in horror, only to find Jian Wushuang standing in front of him and the Triple-kill Sword stuck in him.

“No!” The disciple only had time to make an unwilling roar before he was immediately killed.

“You are the owner of the Interspatial Ring. I can’t let you get away from me.” After killing the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciple, Jian Wushuang grinned and took the Interspatial Ring off the disciple’s finger. As for the Tianhuan Sect disciples that escaped, Jian Wushuang was not in the mood to chase after them.

“Swordsman!”

“Swordsman!”

Jian Wushuang turned his head, finding Yin Min and Ling Tianhao with stunned expressions on their faces that were hard to describe.

Jian Wushuang stroked his nose and then laughed in his sleeve.

Last time, he deliberately lost to Dongfang Yu so he would not stand out, making people think he was weak. And during the mission this time, he still hadn’t found a good chance to prove his ability because of Yin Min. He had finally reached the point where he could not hide it anymore.

His strength shocked Yin Min and Ling Tianhao.

Jian Wushuang killed four real Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in an instant. What kind of strength was that?

Yin Min knew that if she fought against five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples, she could barely resist for a while before eventually losing. In the end, she would die even if she killed one of two of them by risking her life.

Which meant that Jian Wushuang’s strength was much more tremendous than hers.

“Haha, Swordsman, I admire you so much!” When Ling Tianhao regained himself, he laughed and gave Jian Wushuang a bear hug.

“Swordsman, you hid your strength this whole time?” Yin Min asked seriously.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded. There was no sense in denying it now.

“You fought with five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples on your own and killed four of them in a short time. This level of strength is not something me or Dongfang Yu can compare with. Swordsman, you disguised yourself pretty well,” Yin Min said with a smile.

The four who abandoned Jian Wushuang, Yin Min, and Ling Tianhao, gloating as they were surrounded by the Tianhuan Sect disciples, were still very close. They were hiding in a room near the courtyard and heard everything Jian Wushuang and Yin Min said.
