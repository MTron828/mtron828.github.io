Chapter 2179 Power Suffocates

“A Chaotic Divine Demon!” Emperor Bai watched Blood Emperor, his face cloudy and uncertain.As the strongest expert in that era, he knew the most about the Ancient Era.

So he was well aware of the almost insurmountable gap between the Chaotic Divine Demon and the Chaotic Realm.

If it was a normal Chaotic Divine Demon, Emperor Bai could have fought it out with his seventh step Inverse Cultivation and other tricks up his sleeve. But Blood Emperor was the strongest of his Ancient Era.

The fact that he could still exert Chaotic Divine Demon level powers meant that he should have been pretty formidable amongst other Chaotic Divine Demons.

“The Opposing Blood Formation the Blood Emperor can override the restrictions? Crap.” Emperor Bai was in despair.

The Blood Emperor teased and said, “Chaotic Divine Demon levels are nothing when compared to my full power, but it’s more than enough to eradicate all of you. Next up, I’m going to kill you all one by one and find a way to get my formation to cover your Eternal Chaotic World and kill every single Cultivator there is. With that level of Blood Qi, I should be able to restore my true powers.”

They could not help but recall the scene of the death of countless Three Emperors World Cultivators.

If that happened at the Eternal Chaotic World…

“Asshole!” Emperor Bai’s eyes were bloodshot.

“He must die, regardless of the cost!” Jian Wushuang was determined.

.

“Haha, it is you all that will die,” Blood Emperor laughed heartily and made his move.

Before he had simply stood there countering Emperor Bai’s attack, and even that had hurt Emperor Bai.

But now, the Blood Emperor had taken the initiative.

He was like a ghost, disappearing in front of the eyes of many.

Even Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai could not find him with their Soul Power.

The next moment, Blood Emperor reappeared, but he was not going for Emperor Bai. He was going for Jian Wushuang.

He appeared right in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You sabotaged so many of my plans previously. You will be the first to die,” Blood Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Watch out!” Emperor Bai hurriedly roared.

“Hm?” Jian Wushuang’s face sunk, and immediately large amounts of Divine Power could be seen emerging from him.

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Seven golden streaks burst out and went straight for the Blood Emperor.

“Hong Jun Golden Swords?”

If you perform the second form, perhaps that would pose a threat, but only the first form? Only seven streaks? That’s nothing,” The Blood Emperor dismissively waved his finger.

The seven Hong Jun Golden Swords seemed to be devastated simultaneously and flew out at faster speeds. Even the golden shimmer on the swords faded.

Soon, a boundless crimson fog swept directly from the Blood Emperor and surrounded Jian Wushuang.

Within the crimson fog, streaks of red flowing light came from nowhere and flew straight towards Jian Wushuang like spikes.

The dense red flowing light was amazingly fast. Jian Wushuang waved his Blood Mountain Sword and performed his Mixed Elements Spirit swordsmanship, in a desperate attempt to resist.

But he could only block some of it. Others struck his divine body directly.

His body had the Five Gem Armor and Immemorial Celestial Body protecting him.

Normal attacks, even from a Third Stage Great Emperor, would not create much damage.

But the streaks of red blood-like flowing light, each streak of light containing the power of a peak Third Stage Great Emperor, was too much for Jian Wushuang.

At least a hundred streaks of light hit him directly. Even Jian Wushuang could not resist.

Instantly, Jian Wushuang’s divine body started to collapse.

The crimson fog covering Jian Wushuang dissipated as well.

The many Eternal Chaotic World experts all stared at the Void in horror.

The Void was empty, no one was there anymore. Only some divine power aura remained.

“Sword Emperor…”

“Is he dead?”

“How is that possible?”

All the Eternal Chaotic World experts could not believe their eyes.

The Sword Emperor was second to Emperor Bai in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Jian Wushuang was a legend to them.

His growth and rise were astonishing.

The previous clashes with the Three Emperors World had all been blocked by Jian Wushuang. Their respect and fear for Jian Wushuang were no less than Emperor Bai.

Such an existence was instantly wiped out by the Blood Emperor?

That level of strength was simply suffocating!

But was Jian Wushuang really dead?

“Something’s not right!” An exclamation was made by someone.

They immediately looked towards the Void. The originally empty Void now had a large concentration of Divine Power within it.

In a moment, that figure appeared again in front of everyone. It was Jian Wushuang.

His body reformed once again, his aura still intact.

Xiu!

Once he had finished reforming, he immediately retreated, getting some distance from the Blood Emperor.

“This Blood Emperor is so strong!” Even Jian Wushuang had a trace of a tremor in his heart at that moment.

He was indeed too strong, simply suffocating.

Even with his divine body, he had been obliterated in an instant without any room for struggle. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Even though he had managed to recover with the help of his Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, he had already consumed thirty per cent of his Divine Power.

Reaching the second part of his seventh step Inverse Cultivation had allowed his Divine Powers to be stronger than ever before. Even if his body collapsed in an attack, his Divine Power would sustain him for about seven or eight recoveries, but being struck by the Blood Emperor had cost him thirty per cent of his Divine Power.

Meaning to say, his divine body could only last two more hits.

Of course, he still had the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir Emperor Bai passed to him. He had not found any use of it till now.

The Seven Treasure Divine Elixir would allow his Divine Body to recover a few more times.
