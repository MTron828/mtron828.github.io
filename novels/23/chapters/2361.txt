Chapter 2362: Paid a Visit to Apologize

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In front of the door of the Lin Mansion stood numerous experts from the Zhuge Family. Zhuge Yuanchong stood at the front.

The experts from the Lin Mansion were looking at them in a hostile way.

After all, the last time there were this many experts at the Lin Mansion was when the Zhuge Family invaded. That almost resulted in the annihilation of the Lin Mansion. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Experts of the Zhuge Family, what are you doing here at the Lin Mansion? Looking for a fight?”

“A fight? They must have the courage to do so. I heard that these experts from the Zhuge Family are here to apologize.”

“They are paying a visit just to apologize? Haha. This is interesting.”

Many of the experts from the Lin Mansion were chatting casually. They did not lower their voice.

The experts from the Zhuge family heard these comments but they didn’t dare to get angry.

The family head of the Lin Family, Lin Tiefeng, stood in front of everyone.

“Zhuge Yuanchong. I have never thought this day will befall on your family.” Lin Tiefeng smiled coldly.

Zhuge Yuanchong looked up at Lin Tiefeng with rage burning within his eyes, “Lin Tiefeng, you are just a lucky man to have met a good brother during your younger days. You got to meet Jan Wushuang through him. If not, do you think that the Lin Mansion can live to see this day?”

Lin Tiefeng knitted his eyebrows tightly. He soon relaxed. He said,” That is true. I have to admit that the reason why the Lin Mansion survived to this day and the reason why the Zhuge Family will come to apologize today is because of my nephew, Wushuang. However, the reason why I have such a solid relationship with my nephew and his father is because of my own ability. Your Zhuge Family can only envy us.”

Zhuge Yuanchong trembled slightly. He was speechless.

Right then... Lin Yan walked out of the Lin Mansion.

“Father.” Lin Yan walked beside Lin Tiefeng and started to whisper in his ears.

Lin Tiefeng raised his eyebrows and knew what he had to do.

He then turned to Zhuge Yuanchong and said, “Zhuge Yuanchong. My nephew said that he does not want to see you. He wanted Lord Wu Jian to annihilate the Zhuge Family. And, Lord Wu Jian agreed to do so.”

“What?” The experts from the Zhuge Family turned pale.

Zhuge Yuanchong trembled.

Seeing this, Lin Tiefeng’s smile widened as he said, “However, you are smart enough to come and apologize before Lord Wu Jian annihilated your family. Hence, my nephew Wushuang is willing to space your lives. However, your family needs to pay a price.”

The experts from the Zhuge Family heaved a sigh of relief.

Zhuge Yuanchong glared into Lin Tiefeng’s eyes and said, “What is the price we have to pay?”

“Simple. You need to surrender some resources, treasures, and properties. How about this, give me a moment and I will prepare a list for you. You can see for yourself.”

Line Tiefeng turned and walked back into the Lin Mansion.

He soon walked out.

“This is the list. Read carefully.” Lie Tiefeng squinted his eyes as he passed a list to Zhuge Yuanchong.

Zhuge Yuanchong’s face turned extremely dark with a simple glance on the list.

The higher-ups from the Zhuge Family were so angry that they almost vomited blood!!

There were numerous resources and treasures listed on the list. Even though it would cost the Zhuge Family a great number of resources, they were ready to pay the price from the moment they decided to pay a visit to apologize. They could still accept these demands.

However, the Lin Family demanded half of the properties owned by the Zhuge Family!!

Half of all the properties. Those were the main source of income for the Zhuge Family.

It was many times more valuable as compared to the resources listed earlier in the list.

Furthermore, the Zhuge Family already suffered heavy losses during the battle with the Lin Family. If they were to give up half of their properties, the Zhuge Family would start to wane and would no longer be one of the six top tier families anymore.

“Family head of the Zhuge Family, this is the last chance that my nephew is giving you. It is up to you to decide whether you are willing to take it.” Lin Tiefeng smiled lightly.

Zhuge Yuanchong took a deep breath and looked at Lin Tiefeng coldly. “Lin Tiefeng. Who is the one who made the list? You or Jian Wushuang?”

“You guess?” Lin Tiefeng looked at Zhuge Yuanchong mockingly.

Zhuge Yuanchong didn’t need to guess. The answer was clear.

He knew the list was made by Lin Tiefeng.

If Jian Wushuang were to make the list, all he needed was treasures and resources. Jian Wushuang had no intention of creating a Family. Why would he need these properties?

“The Zhuge Family will give you the things found on the list.” Zhuge Yuanchong said painfully.

“Family head...” The experts from the Zhuge Family clenched their fists tightly. They felt angry and embarrassed. However, there was nothing they could do.

“Alright. After you deliver the things found on the list to the Lin Mansion, I will pass them personally to Jian Wushuang. After this day, my nephew will not cause any trouble for the Zhuge Family anymore. However, if the Zhuge Family tries to play punk or try something funny, my nephew will not hesitate to teach you a lesson.” Lin Tiefeng smiled.

“Obviously not.” Zhuge Yuanchong waved his hand and the experts from the Zhuge Family left.

“Family head of the Zhuge Family. You better hurry up and deliver the items found on the list. My nephew Wushuang is about to go to the Water Fairy Island soon. If he has yet to see what he wants to see, he might get angry.” Lin Tiefeng smiled.

“Humph!”

Zhuge Yuanchong grunted as he turned and left. Before he left, he said with a cold voice, “I will deliver these things to the Lin Mansion within three days!”

Within moments, all of the experts from the Zhuge Family left.

On the other hand, the experts from the Lin Family started chatting.

“Haha. This time, the Zhuge Family took a huge hit!” Lin Tiefenglaughed heartily.

“Father. Even though the conditions you wrote on the paper are harsh, why did the Zhuge Family agree to it?” Lin Yan asked curiously.

“Does he dare to say no? Even though the Zhuge Family will wane for a period of time, they can still prosper in the future. After all, there are two Chaotic Divine Demons in their family. However, the entire Zhuge Family will be annihilated if he angers Jian Wushuang.”

“As compared to complete annihilation, of course he will accept the conditions found on the list.”

“That is it?” Lin Yan nodded his head to show he understood what his father said.
