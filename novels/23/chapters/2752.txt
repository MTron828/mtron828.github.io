“Strange Old Tong has been in the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm bottleneck for too long. There’s hearsay he has attempted in making a breakthrough to Peak Grand Ultimate God realm several times but failed. It seems that he has made his absolute best preparation from my observation. The Huangji Golden Pill isn’t very effective for High-level Grand Ultimate God as it can only increase the success probability by 10 percent, but it should be enough for him to do his best and fight for it,” muttered Jian Wushuang.

The information Jian Wushuang had on Strange Old Tong mentioned his rather strange behavior but was someone who kept his words.

Jian Wushuang no doubt longed to recruit such an expert.

In addition to Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and Strange Old Tong, the other eight people on the list also had high credibility and great strength which fulfilled the requirements Jian Wushuang had set forth and hence were within his recruitment targets.

“Alliance Master, I’m in touch with a few of these ten people on the list. Should I contact them and find out if they’re interested?” Old Snake suggested.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “No need to be so troublesome. Can you find out where they are now? I’ll personally make a trip to meet them.”

“Alliance Master, you mean you plan to meet and recruit them in person?” Old Snake was startled.

“Of course, let’s start with Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin. Where is he?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Jian Wushuang set off on his journey soon after learning Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s location.

At a barren mountain somewhere in the middle of some desolate vast land. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The Hilly Palace mountain—the place Gravel Castle was located.

It was where Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin lived.

Jian Wushuang’s figure arrived in the void before the Gravel Castle and diffused a faint breath of divine power in the area.

Swoosh!

A small figure immediately skimmed out of the Gravel Castle and greeted Jian Wushuang.

“Who are you? Why are you here?” A thin and weak woman wearing green stared closely at Jian Wushuang.

“Are you Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s maid?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the green-clad woman.

Based on the information Jian Wushuang received, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin had a maid whom he rescued many years ago. The grateful maid stayed by Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s side and had feelings for Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

However, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin loved his deceased wife too much and had closed his heart off after his wife’s passing.

The maid knew that very well so she merely stayed beside Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s as a maid and never regretted her decision through all those years.

“Could you please report to your master that Sword Alliance Master Su Han is here to visit him? Can you kindly ask him to come out and meet me?” Jian Wushuang asked with a polite smile.

“Sword Alliance Master?” The green-clad woman was surprised.

She had been with Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin for years and was exposed to many matters in the Danyang Continent. Naturally, she had heard of the Sword Alliance.

The Sword Alliance Master’s name—Su Han—was famous in Danyang Continent.

He was known for his achievement of killing a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God while still a Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

“Alliance Master, please wait a moment as I report to my master.” The green-clad woman immediately went into the castle.

After a long time, the green-clad woman was out of the castle again.

“My master invites you to join him in the castle,” said the green-clad woman.

Jian Wushuang immediately walked toward the Gravel Castle under the green-clad woman’s guidance.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang arrived in a vast hall with a man wearing black sitting at the top of the hall.

The black-clothed man seemed to have been through a lot in his life but his gaze looked indifferent. His dull eyes reflected his feelings of emptiness which could be seen on his impassive face.

He was indeed a man in great despair.

“A pleasure to meet you, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin who seemed to have lost the capabilities to experience emotions.

“I’ve heard of you, Alliance Master Su Han. What brings you here today?” asked Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

“I’m here to invite you to join the Sword Alliance.” Jian Wushuang was very frank with his intentions and made it clear without beating around the bush.

“Really?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was not surprised at all.

He was a famous figure in Danyang Continent for many years. Many forces had found him and explained their intention in the same manner as Jian Wushuang.

He had gotten used to receiving recruitment invitations a long time ago.

“Alliance Master Su Han, you might not know this but several top forces like Crimson Stone Fort, Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect, and Dongfang Clan had come forward to invite me to join them. They offered me attractive terms in return but I remained here in my place,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was indifferent. “I know a lot of forces would naturally want to invite you to join them with your level of strength. Those forces failed to recruit you probably for only one reason. The conditions they offered might not be attractive to you at all.”

“Are you saying you have something that’s able to attract my attention?” asked Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

Jian Wushuang smiled without speaking as he flipped his hand and took out a Huangji Golden Pill.

“Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, I wonder if this pill can attract your attention?” Jian Wushuang asked with a wide grin.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s indifferent expression was startled the moment Jian Wushuang took out a Huangji Golden Pill. His eyes shrank sharply as his gaze was immediately locked onto the Huangji Golden Pill.

“Huangji Golden Pill!”

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s complexion became extremely solemn all of a sudden.

He had been in the Primary-level Grand Ultimate God realm for a long time and never had a chance to make a breakthrough.

He was tempted when a Huangji Golden Pill was placed in front of him.

“Alliance Master Su Han is so generous that you’re willing to give away a Huangji Golden Pill to recruit me. The other top forces in Danyang Continent don’t dare to do what you just did,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

The top forces in the Danyang Continent had previously offered Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin a sufficient amount that was rather attractive to him.

However, those offers were nothing in comparison to the Huangji Golden Pill. The difference was too vast.

It was of course also impossible for those top forces to produce a Huangji Golden Pill to recruit him. Firstly, the Huangji Golden Pill was a rare find that even those top forces had difficulty getting their hands on one. Secondly, they would leave it for their best and most loyal disciples even if they had one. They would certainly never use it to recruit a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

“I wonder if this pill is sufficient to entice you in joining the Sword Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin glanced at Jian Wushuang but shook his head after. “I must admit that though the Huangji Golden Pill is indeed very attractive, it’s unfortunate that I still can’t agree to join you.”
