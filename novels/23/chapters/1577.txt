Chapter 1578: Found!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The experts in Four Symbol Mansion scattered around Earth Fire Demon Lair within a ten billion mile range and searched.

Merely five days later.

There were two Void Real God from Four Symbol Mansion that stopped in the air above the volcano which Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were in.

The two Void Real Gods overlooked the volcano below them.

“I never knew that there was another prohibition here,” a lady in black smiled faintly.

“Real God Huan Ling, it’s your call,” the cold-looking bald man next to her said.

“Let me take care of this,” the lady in black smiled faintly and immediately started to resolve the prohibition.

Burning Demon Region was left behind by an Almighty and there were many traps. As such, among the experts that were sent by Four Symbol Mansion to chase after Duan Lingfeng, many had high attainment in formation and prohibitions. The lady in black, Real God Huan Ling, was one of them.

As Real God Huan Ling was resolving the prohibition, in the volcano that was covered by the prohibition, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“It seems like we can’t continue to hide. We have to fight head-on,” Jian Wushuang stood up.

He knew that once the prohibition at the surrounding of volcano was resolved entirely, Duan Lingfeng and he would be revealed before Four Symbol Mansion.

Then, the experts from Four Symbol Mansion wanted to barge in and Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to stop them. After all, the experts in Four Symbol Mansion could totally ignore him and charge into the cave dwelling to kill Duan Lingfeng.

Hence, he had to take action before the prohibition was resolved.

Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Whistle!

Jian Wushuang flew out in silence.

In the void above, the lady in black was still resolving the prohibition attentively. As for the bald man, he stood next to her.

Just then, there was suddenly a burst in the air.

Although the burst in the air was extremely soft, the bald man instantly noticed.

“Real God Huan Ling, watch out!” The bald man shouted while he immediately wielded a saber.

“What?” The lady in black was frightened.

Wow!

A brilliant sword light suddenly exploded and the sword light was so fast that no one could see the trace.

“Humph!” The bald man humphed and the saber in his hand slashed out like a lightning. It was as though there was thunder from nowhere.

The saber collided with the sword light directly and there was an explosion of fierce power. The bald man retreated from the impact while the lady in black, Real God Huan Ling, retreated too.

The two of them retreated far away before they steadied themselves again. The moment the bald man steadied himself, he immediately took out a communication token, “Found them. Here’s where they are!”

In that instant, the experts from Four Symbol Mansion who were looking for Duan Lingfeng within the ten billion mile range were thrilled with excitement.

“Found him!”

“Finally found him!”

“He’s really around the Earth Fire Demon Lair.”

“Go, hurry up and go!”

A large number of experts hurried over.

In a short while, there were more than forty experts from Four Symbol Mansion in the void surrounding the volcano that came.

Among the experts who came, besides the few Universe Gods, the others were all Void Real Gods!

“There’s quite a number of Real Gods.”

Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand as he stood in the void and watched the group of Real Gods before him. He licked his lips slowly.

For a force like Four Symbol Mansion, ordinary Void Real Gods were nothing.

Just like Lineage of Star, although there weren’t many core Real Gods, Real Gods who were an appendage to Lineage of Star were quite many.

They could easily gather ten or even hundreds of Void Real God to Earth Fire Demon Lair.

Then, the Real Gods from Four Symbol Mansion fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t reveal himself, they were certain that Duan Lingfeng was definitely behind the prohibition behind Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, do you really want to get involved in what happened today?” The cold-looking bald man asked in a deep voice.

“Nonsense! If I am not getting involved, why am I here?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “Duan Lingfeng is my best friend. If you want to kill him, you have to kill me first!”

“You have guts!” The bald man roared.

“Don’t waste time with him. If I’m not mistaken, Real God Qing Ling should have died by Jian Wushuang’s hands,” the old and strong black-haired elderly spoke.

Real God Qing Ling was a Void Real God close to the peak after all. But in the end, he was killed in an instant without any struggle.

Duan Lingfeng definitely couldn’t do that but Jian Wushuang could. He killed Zi Dongwang with one stroke.

“He killed Four Symbol Mansion’s Real God. Although he was the top genius from Lineage of Star, we definitely can’t just let this slip. We need to capture him alive and bring him back to the mansion. Hall Master Yuan from Lineage of Star has to come and apologize personally,” the old and strong black-haired elderly said.

“Alright,” the bald man nodded and he looked at the three Void Real Gods next to him who had stronger auras and said, “Jian Wushuang killed Zi Dongwang in one stroke. He is powerful. Real God Tong Yi, Real God Zhong Huo, Real God Bai Hao, the three of you and I team up and suppress him!”

“No problem,” the three Void Real Gods nodded.

The three of them and the bald man were Peak Void Real Gods. They were the strongest four among the Real Gods at the scene.

If the four of them team up, even if they were to fight against a weaker Eternal Real God, they definitely could be evenly matched.

“Let’s go!”

The bald man bellowed. Then, the four fierce auras suddenly exploded and the four figures plunged forward instantly.

Jian Wushuang continued to stand there but he could feel the pressure that the four fierce auras ahead brought about. However, there was no fear nor worries on his face. On the contrary, there was a glimpse of light in his eyes.

“I went through the third inverse cultivation test for twenty-one thousand years!”

“During the twenty-one thousand years, I never fought with anyone, let alone fight a life-and-death battle.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“My body was asleep for too long. I almost forget the feeling of a massacre.”

“But now… I can finally fight a battle heartily!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and the blood all over his body was boiling.

His intention to fight was billowing!

He stared at the four people who were charging at him.

“Fight, let’s fight!”

“Let me see just how strong I am now!”

With boundless excitement and passion, Jian Wushuang’s figure grew illusory.

Vroom!

Eighteen shadows were cast simultaneously.

The eighteen shadows under the influence of the power of spacetime pierced through the void easily. The speed of it… The four void Real Gods from Four Symbol Mansion moved before Jian Wushuang much earlier but Jian Wushuang rushed to them faster than they did to him.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

The eighteen shadows wielded their swords altogether and swung.

It looked as though there were really eighteen people launching an attack at the same time.
