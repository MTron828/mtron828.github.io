Chapter 1511: Dim Shadow

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“A Universe God’s comprehension of the Heaven Way could clear the second level of the Doctrine Palace?”

When Jian Wushuang saw the information of the God Destroying King, he clicked his tongue.

He had completely understood the Doctrine Palace from the King of Venomous Worms. He was very clear that the higher the Doctrine Palace, the harder it was to clear.

Even among the Real Gods, there were not many of them who did it. Only those who stood at the top had the right to clear the second level of the Doctrine Palace.

For a Universe God to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace, he would be considered a super monster. As for clearing the second level… It was almost impossible.

However, the God Destroying King was that frightening.

“Even Zi Dongwang, who ranked second, and Ling Luo, who ranked third in the Universe God ranking list, were extremely terrified of the God Destroying King. If I were to come across this God Destroying King, most likely there would only be room for me to escape miserably,” Jian Wushuang gasped with admiration.

He knew his own abilities inside out. If he were to come across Zi Dongwang and Ling Luo at the very moment, he could still try fighting against them. However, if he were to come across the God Destroying King, he would definitely be unable to compete against him.

However, Wu Bei’s cave was huge. Hence, the chances of him coming across that God Destroying King were not high.

Jian Wushuang continued to roam around inside Wu Bei’s cave and depended on his Soul Power to search for the Iron Wing Beasts. However, perhaps it was due to there not being many Iron Wing Beasts left in Wu Bei’s cave, his chances of finding Iron Wing Beats were not as high as before. Moreover, even if he managed to find the Iron Wing Beasts, their bodies might not contain the White Blaze Fruit.

Time flew by… Three months had passed since Wu Bei’s cave opened. By relying on his Soul Power, which gave him an advantage, Jian Wushuang killed another Iron Wing Beast and he obtained his third White Blaze Fruit. Of course, during his process of obtaining the third White Blaze Fruit, there was no avoiding a massacre.

A number of jealous Universe Gods tried in vain to team up and kill Jian Wushuang to get the White Blaze Fruit. However, they were all massacred by Jian Wushuang mercilessly in the end.

In Wu Bei’s cave where massacres occurred all over the place as many Universe Gods fought madly for the White Blaze Fruit.

Boom! All of a sudden, the whole cave shook.

The frequency of the earthquakes increased continuously as well.

“What happened?”

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be that this cave is about to close?”

Many Universe Gods in the cave were stunned.

While they were stupefied, in the void in the highest part of the cave, a dim shadow formed slowly.

The dim shadow was not big. However, they existed in each and every corner of the cave.

When the great number of Universe Gods in the cave raised their heads in succession, they could see the dim shadow. However, they were unable to see the real appearance of the dim shadow.

They were even unable to sense the presence of the dim shadow’s aura.

After the dim shadow appeared, an extremely magnanimous yet slightly evil voice resounded within the cave.

“Universe Gods of the Eternal Chaotic World, welcome to my cave.”

The voice could be heard from all directions. For the Universe Gods in the cave, no matter which corner of the cave they were at, they could hear the voice clearly.

However, after hearing the voice clearly, many of them were shocked.

Welcome to my cave?

Everyone knew that the cave was left behind by Real God Wu Bei. Hence, could the person speaking be Real God Wu Bei?

“Wu Bei!”

“That madman. Even though he is already dead, he still left his consciousness behind in his own cave intentionally!”

“As I guessed, this cave is not as simple as we think.”

Within the big hall in the sky of the island, many Almighties knew about the changes in Wu Bei’s cave. At once, the big hall became lively.

“What does that madman intend to do?”

It was obvious that the Almighties did not dare to underestimate Real God Wu Bei.

Inside the cave, the voice of the dim shadow continued on, “My cave has already been opened for three months. During the three months, the fifteen White Blaze Fruits that I left behind in the first level of this cave have all landed in the hands of all of you. Next, it’s about time that all of you enter the second level of the cave. The second level will have more White Blaze Fruits. There will be a total of fifty of them!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the Universe Gods in each and every corner of Wu Bei’s cave became excited at once.

“This cave has a second level?”

“The first level has fifteen White Blaze Fruits while the second level has a total of fifty White Blaze Fruits?”

“Gosh!”

Many Universe Gods were extremely enthusiastic.

Especially those Universe Gods who had not obtained any White Blaze Fruits previously.

Even the Almighties and the Real God experts from many various powerhouses within the big hall became extremely excited at that moment.

“The second level has a total of fifty White Blaze Fruits?”

“Is that true?”

“How can there be so many?”

The Almighties found it unbelievable.

It should be known that in the history of the Eternal Chaotic World, one White Blaze Fruit alone was extremely precious and it was enough to make the Almighties yearn for it.

During the three months on the island, the fifteen White Blaze Fruits found in Wu Bei’s cave had already caused the Almighties to be astonished.

At the moment, the consciousness that Wu Bei left behind actually told them that there was a total of fifty White Blaze Fruits in the second level?

Burning with excitement!

The eyes of the Almighties in the big hall were burning with excitement.

Of course, even though they were burning with excitement, they were still able to retain their senses.

Inside the cave.

“I will give all of you a month’s time to either rest or make preparations. After one month, the second level of the cave will open. Before that, I will give all of you a reminder first. The space of the second level of the cave is not as huge as the first level. Moreover, there are many White Blaze Fruits. Hence, perhaps the fight would be crazier? Haha.

An evil laugh echoed in the universe and what followed after that was the dim shadow dissipating slowly.

However, the Universe Gods in the cave were unable to remain calm.

After one month, the second level of the cave would open and the fight would become more intense!

Jian Wushuang stood at the top of a lofty mountain and he frowned slightly.

“King of Venomous Worms, do you think Real God Wu Bei is speaking the truth? Are there really so many White Blaze Fruits in the second level of the cave?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“No idea. However, under normal circumstances, it would be impossible to accumulate so many White Blaze Fruits from one White Blaze Fruit tree alone, even after many years,” the King of Venomous Worms continued speaking, “Moreover, this Real God Wu Bei is really a madman and he can do anything. Hence, you must really remain vigilant.”

“No matter how crazy Real God Wu Bei is, I have to go to the second level. Even if it is not for the White Blaze Fruit, I have to go for the sake of obtaining the training method for an Inverse Cultivator,” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and said in a serious tone.

“You’re right,” the King of Venomous Worms also understood, “He gave all of you a month’s time to prepare. Therefore, you should make your preparations.”

Jian Wushuang nodded his head and sat down with his legs crossed after that.

Inside the cave, many Universe Gods stopped fighting temporarily and started to prepare.
