Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, Hall Master Yuan and the other two Hall Masters gawked.

Jian Wushuang was an expert on the sixty-first place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He had absolute fighting power of an Emperor God, but his servant was more powerful than he was?

“That’s great. Another fighting power of Emperor God!” Hall Master Yuan exclaimed in surprise.

“With so many Dao soldiers and a powerful servant. Palace Master, you brought about a great surprise to Lineage of Star indeed,” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun was excited.

However, the three of them never paid attention to what Jian Wushuang said. “He is stronger than I am now.”

One should know that Jian Wushuang had received countless opportunities as he wandered alone in the ancient battlefield for six thousand years. He had advanced by leaps and bounds and he was no longer comparable to how he was before while Jian Yi was even stronger than he was then. How could Jian Yi’s fighting power be as simple as an ordinary Emperor God?

Palace Master, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun, there’s another thing that I have to tell you,” Hall Master Yuan suddenly said.

Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Masters immediately looked at Hall Master Yuan again.

“Actually, there is another trump card in Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and revealed a shocked expression.

Hall Master Yuan started explaining, “The three of you should know that I am very special in Lineage of Star. According to Lineage of Star’s rules, only one who possesses fighting power of an Almighty could become a Hall Master. However, I am not an Almighty, nor do I have fighting power of an Almighty, but I became a Hall Master…”

Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun were interested in what Hall Master Yuan was going to say.

They were curious about Hall Master Yuan’s existence. They had tried asking before but Hall Master Yuan never answered.

“My identity is supposed to be a secret. In Lineage of Star, only Master of Star Palace knows. However, it is a crucial moment and I cannot hide anymore. Everyone, please take a look,” Hall Master Yuan said as he let out a unique aura from his body. The aura spread outside the hall and blended with the boundless galaxy flawlessly.

“This, this is…” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Niu Yun were dumbfounded.

“Weapon’s Spirit!” Jian Wushuang were shocked.

Yes, the aura that Hall Master Yuan gave out then only belonged to spirit’s weapon.

Plus, his aura blended flawlessly with the boundless galaxy that Lineage of Star was in. In other words, Hall Master Yuan was the weapon’s spirit of the boundless galaxy.

“How could it be?” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun were in disbelief.

They had been making wild guesses about Hall Master Yuan’s identity before but they had never expected Hall Master Yuan to be a weapon’s spirit.

Looking at the few people’s reactions, Hall Master Yuan wasn’t surprised but he smiled and said, “Everyone, do you remember that Master of Star Palace once mentioned before he left to go to ancient mystery land? He said that back when he went to Seven Star Realm, not only had he found the Secret Skill of Seven Star, but he also obtained a unique treasure. The unique treasure… is me, the boundless galaxy that engulfed the lair of Lineage of Star. However, my real name is actually Universe Galaxy.

The three of them were dumbfounded at the new found knowledge.

The boundless galaxy that Lineage of Star was located in was really unique. Not only could it nurture a Meta Beast on its own, but the spiritual influence of heaven and earth, and intensity of Doctrine were also much stronger than other places. However, they never once thought that the galaxy was a treasure, a treasure from ancient mystery land!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and smiled, “Hall Master Yuan, you kept the secret well.”

“I had no choice. My existence is unique and it isn’t common. If this were to be exposed, the people who cast greedy eyes over the treasure and resources of Lineage of Star would be even more,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang understood too.

At the same time, he finally knew why Hall Master Yuan’s position in Lineage of Star was so unique.

As a weapon’s spirit, he was of course absolutely loyal to Master of Star Palace. The Master of Star Palace was also at ease when he passed the affairs in Lineage of Star to Hall Master Yuan. Although the outside world knew of Hall Master Yuan’s existence, they had never once seen Hall Master Yuan fight because Hall Master Yuan almost never left Lineage of Star.

Even if he were to head out, it was merely his consciousness embodiment.

“Hall Master Yuan, you said earlier that your existence was also the trump card of Lineage of Star. How does it work?” Hall Master Nie Yun asked.

“Universe Galaxy that I made isn’t as simple as you imagine it to be. The power that is displayed on a normal day is merely a fraction of it. If there were to be strong enemies that came to attack, Universe Galaxy could turn into a formation. Unless a Great Emperor came personally, there won’t be anyone who could barge into the galaxy,” Hall Master Yuan said with confidence.

Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Master were thrilled.

“Haha, I never knew that Lineage of Star had another powerful trump card,” Hall Master Nie Yun laughed.

“Only when a Great Emperor comes personally, could he resolve the formation. If there was no real reason, why would a Great Emperor come to Lineage of Star personally. With this trump card, no matter what kind of danger we are in, at least Lineage of Star’s base can be maintained,” Hall Master Gu Xin smiled too.

Hall Master Yuan then said regretfully, “It is a pity that I was severely damaged during the war. The spiritual influence of heaven and earth in this world is so thin that I have yet to recover. If I were to be able to recover parts of my power, the benefits that Lineage of Star wouldn’t be limited as it is now.”

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun didn’t react much to what he said.

But Jian Wushuang quivered in surprise.

Spiritual influence of heaven and earth?

The spiritual influence of heaven and earth in Green Fire World was much stronger than Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Along with the formation, it was on a constant increase.

If he were to be able to move Universe Galaxy there…

Of course, it was merely a thought that Jian Wushuang had.

“With these trump cards, if Lineage of Star were to be in trouble, we should be confident enough,” Jian Wushuang smiled and turned to ask, “Hall Master Yuan, the news about Master of Star Palace’s death has yet to spread, right?”

“Besides the few of us, no one else knows,” Hall Master Yuan nodded, “However, even if we hide the news on purpose, people will find out in no time. After all, Sanctuary Alliance has experts keeping watch outside the ancient mystery land. Whoever enters ancient mystery land but doesn’t come out from ancient mystery land is recorded.”

“Now that the ancient mystery land is still open. Naturally, no one knows. However, when the ancient mystery land closes, Sanctuary Alliance will notice that the Master of Star Palace didn’t come out and they’d eighty-percent determine that the Master of Star Palace had passed away then.”

“If so, we still have time to prepare ourselves,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.
