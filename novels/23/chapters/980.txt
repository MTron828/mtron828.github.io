Chapter 981: The Golden-Robed Elder

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In front of all the experts of Tang of the East and the three big countries, Ape Holy Master, West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor made a promise.

They swore that they would not attack Tang of the East within 100,000 years.

“We’ve made a promise, Jian Wushuang. Are you satisfied?” Ape Holy Master was barely able to control his temper.

“Yes, I am,” Jian smiled and said. “Since you’ve made a promise, you should start honoring it now.”

“Hmph!” Ape Holy Master snorted and then shifted his gaze toward the royal palace of Tang of the East.

“Emperor Xiao, you got lucky this time. Enjoy it while it lasts.”

Ape Holy Master said and then looked at the other two masters beside himself.

“Let’s go.”

They were ready to take their departure.

Nevertheless, before they could do so…

“So you think you can walk out of here in one piece?” A sonorous voice was heard.

The three masters stopped.

A golden-robed elder who seemed to came out of nowhere was standing in front of them.

He had silver hair and looked nice. What was most noticeable about him was the cinnabar mole between his eyebrows. He popped out all of a sudden. The three masters were standing so close to him but they had not noticed anything.

“He, he…”

The three masters flinched when they saw the elder.

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Leng Rushuang also saw the elder as soon as he came out.

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun were thrilled to see him.

They started to rush toward him immediately.

They did not care that they were badly wounded; they came out of the protective formation and the royal palace. They went to kneel in front of the elder.

“Master!”

“Master!”

The two said simultaneously. They could barely mask the happiness in their voice.

Everyone present was obviously shocked, including Jian Wushuang.

He turned to take a look at the elder, and thought in astonishment.

“Master?

“The emperors’ master?

“Everybody in the Green Fire World knows who their master is.

“They’re calling this elder Master.

“That means this elder is Tang Emperor!

“He’s the founder of Tang of the East and the master of Emperor Qing, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Emperor Leng.

“He has disappeared for many years and now he’s back?”

The whole royal palace was carried away by wild excitement.

Experts inside the palace could not help but burst into thunderous cheers upon learning that Tang Emperor was back.

After all, it was Tang Emperor.

The mysterious founder of Tang of the East.

He created this country and trained Emperor Qing, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Emperor Leng.

He had disappeared for years. Many people, including Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun, had believed that he was dead.

Beyond their expectations, he came back.

“Get up,” Tang Emperor raised his hand, and the two Emperors kneeled in front of him stood up.

“We’ll talk later.”

After that, the elder diverted his eyes to Ape Holy Master, West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor.

“Things sure have changed since I left. Back then, Tang of the East was the only country in this world, but now there are four, and the three of you join hands to attack us. How dare you,” Tang Emperor said nonchalantly.

The three masters swallowed hard.

They were very afraid of Tang Emperor. They were 100 times afraid of him than they did Jian Wushuang.

What was scary about Jian Wushuang was his potential; it hadn’t happened yet.

It was another story for Tang Emperor.

The experts in the royal palace were gloating. They stared at the three masters happily, who had been pretty arrogant a moment ago.

Jian Wushuang just forced them away; he did not actually wreak vengeance on them. Now that Tang Emperor was here, it was a whole other story.

“A Holy Master and two Dao Masters, you wanted to destroy us?

“That’s hilarious.”

Tang Emperor scoffed at the three masters, and then he pointed a finger toward them.

It might look casual, but the three masters quickly felt the power gathered on the finger.

They were scared. Even Ape Holy Master, the most powerful of them, was not confident about resisting this attack. The next moment, they spitted blood and dropped to the ground.

When they managed to stand up again, they looked paler than ever.

“He…

“He’s so powerful!

“It’s scary!”

The crowd was surprised.

He hurt them pretty badly with just a finger, and it was obvious that he did not use his full strength. If he did they would be dead by now.

“Jian Wushuang, this old dude is fierce. He’s much stronger than Dao Yuanzi. Even with the Blood-killing Plate Armor, that Dao Yuanzi could never beat him,” Gu King’s voice was inside Jian Wushuang’s head. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Really?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Tang Emperor looked at the three masters.

“You should feel lucky that you’ve promised to not come back for 100,000 years. Otherwise, you’d be dead by now.”

Tang Emperor’s cold voice was heard throughout the world
