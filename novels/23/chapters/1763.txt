Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In Soaring Heaven Mansion, in the hall located right in the middle.

There was an independent space in the hall where lofty thrones towered. There were four of them in leading positions.

The four of them gave out strong auras, far beyond the rest of the people’s. The four of them were Almighties.

“Xue Kong, Chi Xing was really killed by Jian Wushuang with just one palm?”

A brawny man who was raging like an ancient beast said. His voice contained boundless murderous intention.

“Yes,” Real God Xue Kong’s face was twitching in agony. He looked terrified under the pressure of the brawny man, “He killed Sir God Chi Xing and wanted me to bring back a message. He said that this is only the beginning. He wants the experts in Soaring Heaven King Palace, including everyone here, to clean our necks and wait.”

“How dare he!” The brawny man slammed his arm rest and the throne he was sitting on immediately broke. He stood up and roared, “Jian Wushuang really thinks that we of Soaring Heaven King Palace can’t do anything about him?”

All the experts’ faces grew grave but most of them were astonished.

He had killed Sir God Chi Xing with one palm.

An Almighty had died in one move. There wouldn’t be many who Sir Gods who could do that.

“Qing Fu, among the four of us, you are the strongest as you have already reached the peak of Sir God. If you were to fight with Chi Xing, do you think you could kill him instantly?” An Almighty asked.

Everyone immediately looked at Qing Fu.

Qing Fu was a young man in a green robe. Although he looked young, he was actually the most ancient one among all experts and he was also the strongest. He had already lived for tens of thousands of years.

“To kill Chi Xing with one move?” Sir God Qing Fu thought, “If I were to prepare ahead and launch the strongest hit with my all, I couldn’t kill Sir God Chi Xing directly. However, when Sir God Chi Xing fought with Jian Wushuang, he didn’t prepare ahead of time but straight away sent out his palm that break Sir God Chi Xing’s attack and kill him.”

“He might be even stronger than I am!”

The experts creased their eyebrows tightly as they heard what Sir God Qing Fu said.

Sir God Qing Fu was already the strongest among them but he wasn’t confident that he could win against Jian Wushuang, let alone the rest of them.

“B*stard, how long has it been? Jian Wushuang has already improved to this level?” The ancient, beast-like brawny man roared.

“The inverse cultivator is too scary!”

“Jian Wushuang was so talented. Back when he was in the Eighth Lair, Soaring Heaven King Palace should have gone all-out. We should have paid a price and killed him.”

“It’s already too late now. Let’s think about what to do.”

Everyone started discussing in the hall but they couldn’t figure out any countermeasures.

Jian Wushuang was too powerful and he could kill an Almighty with just one palm. Relying on his power, if he were to start massacre wantonly in Seat Continent, Soaring Heaven King Palace couldn’t do anything about Jian Wushuang with their power on Sea Continent.

“I have already report this to Emperor God Tian Xiao. Emperor God Tian Xiao will figure out a way. After all, Soaring Heaven King Palace has been the overlord for so many years. Our foundation and power isn’t shakeable by Jian Wushuang alone. By then, Jian Wushuang will definitely have to pay a great price for his arrogance!” Sir God Qing Fu said.

Everyone heard and nodded in agreement. They were obviously very confident in Soaring Heaven King Palace’s power.

Just then…

Hong!

There was a sudden loud thud. Along with the noise, a great power swept in.

The cultivators in Soaring Heaven Mansion were shaken. The higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace in the hall were naturally frightened as well.

Why?”

“This movement… It spread from the Protective Array. Someone is attacking our Protective Array?”

The experts were first stunned then instantly raged with anger. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“How dare he!”

As everyone cursed, large number of figures plunged out from Soaring Heaven Mansion. The four Almighties in the lofty hall and the top Chaotic Real Gods flew out. Before they could even leave Soaring Heaven Mansion to find out who it was, a sword light swung out.

The sword light was too brilliant. Even with the Protective Array, everyone could feel how scary the sword light was.

As the sword light descended, the Protective Array of Soaring Heaven Mansion collapsed completely.

Then, a cold voice was heard.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, I came… to take revenge!”

The voice was deafening and it constantly reverberated in Soaring Heaven Mansion.

There was boundless coldness in the voice and it struck fear into the hearts of many experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace.

The higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace, including Sir God Qing Fu, their faces grew grave when they heard him.

“Take revenge?” Real God Xue Kong’s eyes were wide. “It’s Jian Wushuang! It’s him!!”

“Jian Wushuang?”

Many experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace were surprised.

“He has guts! Soaring Heaven King Palace was having a headache trying to seize a chance to kill him. He took the initiative and visited us instead?”

“He’s only a Real God and he dares to barge into Soaring Heaven Mansion. He’s courting death!”

An angry voice continued to reverberate.

“Let’s go!”

Sir God Qing Fu’s glare was cold and it contained boundless murderous intention. He waved and plunged to the source of the voice along with the higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace.

The moment they reached the entrance, the experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace was the figure in a crimson robe who looked unyielding in the void before them.

He was alone and he held a crimson sword in his hand with billowing sword intention. He saw the experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace came out together but he wasn’t afraid.

Looking at Jian Wushuang in front of them, everyone from Soaring Heaven King Palace was filled with murderous intentions.

Just like how the elder from Five Spirit Sect had mentioned at the mansion gate before, Soaring Heaven King Palace held sway over Sea Continent. Ever since they had built Soaring Heaven Mansion, there had been hardly anyone who had dared to provoke the dignity of Soaring Heaven Mansion over the years. Those who had were instantly killed by Soaring Heaven Mansion with thunderous skill and their sect had been exterminated.

It had always been like that.

Due to the massacres over the years, Soaring Heaven Mansion had had definite authority on Sea Continent.

But then… Jian Wushuang had come to Soaring Heaven Mansion alone and broken the Soaring Heaven Mansion’s Protective Array.

Jian Wushuang, alone with one sword, had delivered himself to their doorstep.

It was also the first time someone had delivered themself to Soaring Heaven Mansion doorstep since they were established.

“There is a road to heaven and you won’t go; There is no door to hell but you barged in. Jian Wushuang, no matter how capable you are, you are going to die, without a doubt!”
