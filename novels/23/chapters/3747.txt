Chapter 3750: The Target, Pupil Master!

The Mountain River Map was Xuan Yi’s strongest Suppression Type Supreme Treasure, and it had always been in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

However, because the level of the map was too high, Jian Wushuang had been unable to use its strongest power. However, the map had always been one of Jian Wushuang’s strongest trump cards. Until the last moment, he would not use it easily.

Now, as long as he could kill Pupil Master, Jian Wushuang did not mind using this trump card.

“The map is indeed the strongest Suppression Type Supreme Treasure, but the threshold to use this Supreme Treasure is very high. Heavenly Sword Marquis, can you use all of the power of the map now?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said.

“Of course I can’t use all of its power, but only a part of its power is enough to suppress a Primary Ruler like Pupil Master and make him unable to escape,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s enough that he can do that.” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master nodded. “In that case, let’s not delay. Temporal and I will rush to the Third Continent immediately. Also, send an order to Star Palace, which is exploring the Third Continent, and the experts of the three Freedom Alliances to find out the location of Pupil Master.”

“Wait for the three of us to arrive, then we’ll act immediately.”

“Okay.”

Jian Wushuang and Temporal Temple Master nodded one after another.

After breaking the communication, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master immediately rushed to the Third Continent as fast as they could.

Although Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were on different continents, it only took less than a day for an expert at the Ruler level to arrive at the Third Continent. The three experts at the Ruler level of the Divine Beginning Realm had already gathered.

At the same time, the orders of the three of them had been passed down. Star Palace and the Great Beings from the three Freedom Alliances who were adventuring on the Third Continent began to pay attention to Pupil Master’s position.

Pupil Master was, after all, a true Ruler, and he had the protection of the most powerful True Treasure Armor. He was practically able to do whatever he wanted on the Third Continent. Naturally, he did not have any qualms about doing things. If they wanted to find his position…it was very easy.

Ten days later.

In the Red Void space on the Third Continent.

Buzz!

A war blade appeared out of thin air. This war blade was a top-tier True Treasure, and it was very valuable. Naturally, it attracted many great beings to fight for it.

In this fight, Blood Ancestor from the Heaven Ancestor Daoist sect, one of the three Freedom Alliances, was very lucky. He took the war blade.

Although there were quite a few lords of laws rushing over, there weren’t many of them, and their strength wasn’t too tyrannical. Seeing that the battle saber had already fallen into the hands of the blood clan, they could only give up and didn’t step out to snatch it, just as the blood clan was about to take the battle saber and leave this piece of void space...

A terrifying aura suddenly descended.

The person who came was none other than the eye lord.

Pupil Master stood in the void space and looked down at Blood Ancestor. That Ruler-level aura directly pressed down on Blood Ancestor’s body, and Blood Ancestor could not help but tremble.

Blood Ancestor’s face instantly became extremely unsightly.

“Lord Pupil Master, it’s just an ordinary top-tier True Treasure,” Blood Ancestor said in a low voice. “You don’t have to lower your status as a Ruler, do you?”.

“Cut the crap. Hand it over, or you’ll die!” Pupil Master’s eyes turned cold.

Although Blood Ancestor was unwilling to give up, he did not dare to disobey Pupil Master because of his power. He took out the blade and handed it to Pupil Master.

“Humph! You know your place.”

Pupil Master sneered, put the blade into his universe ring, and left.

However, he did not notice the cold and resentful eyes of the Blood Ancestor after he left.

“Temporal Temple Master, I’ve met Pupil Master. My position is...” The Blood Ancestor had already sent a message to Temporal Temple Master.

…

Pupil Master was moving forward slowly in the void. There was a hint of pride on his face.

“That ant just now wasn’t too stupid. If he didn’t hand it over or talked back to me, I would have a reason to kill him directly.” Pupil Master sneered, “Although he’s just an ordinary Principles Master in the Divine Beginning Realm, if I can kill him, I’ll be relieved.”

Pupil Master really wanted to kill the Blood Ancestor.

It was not because the Blood Ancestor had a treasure that attracted him, nor was it because of a top-tier Supreme Treasure, the war saber.

The real reason was that the Blood Ancestor came from the Divine Beginning Realm and the three Freedom Alliances.

Pupil Master had also heard that Jian Wushuang was not only from Star Palace, but also had an extraordinary relationship with the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm. He had previously been angered by Jian Wushuang and had fled in a sorry state after being killed by Jian Wushuang, of course, he had some complaints in his heart.

Killing a Principles Master from the three Freedom Alliances would not completely relieve Pupil Master’s anger, but at least it would make him feel slightly better.

Unfortunately, the speed at which the Blood Ancestor handed over the treasure was too fast, so he did not have the opportunity or excuse to act.

He was a Ruler, and it was already excessive for him to take the initiative to force a Ruler of Principles to hand over the treasure. If the other party had already handed over the treasure and he still killed the other party, then it would indeed be a little too much, this would also cause many Rulers in this Star Field to dislike him.

Thus, he did not act directly just now.

“Hmph, it doesn’t matter. There are so many experts from the Star Palace and the three major Freedom Alliances adventuring in the Red Cloud World. In the future, there will be plenty of opportunities to encounter experts from the Star Palace and the three major Freedom Alliances. When the time comes, we’ll find an opportunity to kill a few more.” Pupil Master laughed coldly.

He had been adventuring in this Star Field for so long, and had always been free to do whatever he wanted.

With his strength and life-saving trump cards, he rarely suffered defeat in this Star Field.

However, in the fierce battle with Jian Wushuang, not only did he suffer defeat, but he also lost a lot of face.

As a mighty Ruler, he was killed by a Principles Master and fled in a sorry state. This made him a joke for a moment. Of course, he wanted to take revenge on Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was so powerful that he could not take revenge on Jian Wushuang.

“Humph, Blood Sword Master, I can’t take revenge on you, but I can take revenge on your subordinates. What can you do to me?” Pupil Master sneered in his heart.

However, at this moment, a familiar aura suddenly appeared in the range of his soul power.

The appearance of this aura immediately caused Pupil Master’s expression to change.

“This aura...is Blood Sword Master?” Pupil Master’s expression immediately became serious. “Blood Sword Master actually came to the void near me. Did he just happen to pass by?”

Pupil Master did not doubt it at first. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After all, Jian Wushuang had been adventuring in the Third Continent. Although the Third Continent was quite big, after adventuring for so many years, it was normal for them to meet each other halfway.
