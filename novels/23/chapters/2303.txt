Chapter 2304 Duel

“Duel?” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.“Little one, if I am not wrong, you are Jian Wushuang,” the teenage boy stared at Jian Wushuang and said.

“Yes I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and said.

“Haha. That is great! Jian Wushuang, I am Lin Yan. I hereby challenge you. Come, fight me.” Lin Yan said as he took out a sword.

Jian Wushuang was not interested in this battle even though Lin Yan was hyped up about it.

“Sorry, I reject your challenge,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said.

“Reject? Haha. You won’t be able to reject my challenge. Watch out.” Lin Yan smiled in an eerie way.

Lin Yan attacked.

A sword light lit up as the snow seemed to stop falling.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He would not feel threatened by Lin Yan no matter what he did.

However, he was surprised when he saw the sword skill that Lin Yan used.

He could see that the sword skill was of a high level, much higher than the sword skill he had been studying previously.

It was a pity that such an incredible skill had such a poor effect when Lin Yan used it.

Jian Wushuang sat on a stone bench. He simply moved to the side and dodged the sword easily.

“Oh? Did you dodge it? Again...” Lin Yan’s eyes lit up in excitement.

Lin Yan started to cast another attack.

“Lin Yan, what are you doing?” A deep voice was heard as Lin Yan stopped what he was doing.

Jian Wushuang looked over at the entrance of the garden. He saw a fierce middle-aged man in silver clothes walking in alongside Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin.

This middle-aged man in silver clothes was the head of the Lin Family, Lin Tiefeng.

“Father.”

Lin Yan became obedient when he saw his father.

“What is happening?” Lin Tiefeng placed his hands behind his back and looked over.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were also wondering what was going on.

“Nothing much. I heard that Uncle Zhuo’s son is Jian Wushuang, and that he excels in the Sword Doctrine. I am excited to have a duel with him,” Lin Yan said.

“Is that the case?” Lin Tiefeng raised his eyebrows.

“Haha. Nephew is only two years older than Wushuang and they are peers. It would be normal for them to have a duel.” Zhuo Yunfeng smiled.

“So how did the duel go?” Lin Tiefeng asked.

“We had only just started our duel when you came in.” Lin Yan then turned to Jian Wushuang and said, “Jian Wushuang, now both of our fathers are here. Fight me head-on. I want to see if you are really talented.”

Lin Tiefeng, Zhuo Yunfeng and the others smiled at this and they did not seem like they intended to step in.

Zhuo Yunfeng was hoping that Lin Yan would fight Jian Wushuang to teach him a lesson: if you were weak, you would be bullied and there would be nothing you could do about it. This could serve as a wake-up call so that Jian Wushuang would no longer reject his offers of going to a clan to cultivate.

Jian Wushuang saw everyone’s expressions and smiled, “Okay. I will have a duel with you. However, it will be too boring if it is a normal duel. Let us add a bet.”

“You want to make a bet? Sure, what do you want to stake?” Lin Yan was excited.

“Simple, I want the sword skill that you just cast,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“My sword skill? That sword skill is Sword Principle Snow Congelation. Only certain core disciples within the Lin Family can learn it. No outsiders are allowed to learn this,” Lin Yan frowned and said.

Lin Tiefeng smiled, “Brother Yunfeng is a brother to me. Wushuang is not an outsider. He can learn the Sword Principle Snow Congelation.”

Hearing this, Lin Yan nodded his head, “Alright. My father has agreed to let you learn it. If you lose, I do not need sword skills from you. How about this: you will stay with me for a year and become my Sword Boy?”

A Sword Boy was a servant dedicated to another to refine their sword skills.

Lin Yan was the son of the head of the Lin Family. He had his own personal sword boys at home.

However, how could they compare to Jian Wushuang?

Lin Yan got extremely excited thinking of the idea that the famous Jian Wushuang would become his Sword Boy.

Ling Tiefeng knitted his eyebrows tightly and said, “Lin Yan, don’t be disrespectful.”

He was thinking that if the son of his brother became his own son’s sword boy, things would get complicated.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang said

“This...” Ling Tiefeng was shocked.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin also raised their eyebrows.

They had never thought that Jian Wushuang would agree. Didn’t that mean that Jian Wushuang would become a sword boy if he lost?

“Where does this little one get his confidence from? Lin Yan is incredibly talented in the Sword Doctrine, and he is two years older than Wushuang,” Zhuo Yunfeng knitted his eyebrows and said.

“Husband.” Luo Xinqin looked over.

“Don’t panic. Let’s watch.” Zhuo Yunfeng signaled Luo Qinxin.

Lin Tiefeng also noticed the change of mood in Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Qinxin. He said, “Brother Yunfeng, Lin Yan is just messing around. Please do not take it seriously. If I am not wrong, seeing how confident Wushuang is, I am afraid that the Sword Principle Snow Congelation will become his.”

Lin Tiefeng was speaking the truth. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He had heard of Jian Wushuang before. He knew that Jian Wushuang was extremely talented in the Sword Doctrine.

Even though Lin Yan was two years older than Jian Wushuang, he had no confidence in his own son.

Hearing this, Zhuo Yunfeng smiled bitterly, “Brother Lin might not know of this, but actually, Wushuang is not as talented as the outside world has claimed. Wushuang is talented at Sword Doctrine, but he is definitely not as powerful as Lin Yan.”

“Oh?” Lin Tiefeng was stunned.

“Brother Lin Yi knows about this as well, you can ask him,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Lin Yi.” Lin Tiefeng waved his hand and Lin Yi walked up to him.

“Clan Master, City Governor Zhuo is speaking the truth. He asked to guide the little one on the path of the sword doctrine four years ago. I agreed and came here to test how talented he is in the sword doctrine. He is not very talented. During the test, he also seemed very confident,” Lin Yi said.

“Really? Jian Wushuang’s name was given to him by Taoist Priest Xuan Shen himself. There shouldn’t have been any mistake.”

“It doesn’t matter anymore. Let’s watch them,” Lin Tiefeng said.
