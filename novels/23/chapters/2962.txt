Chapter 2963: Supreme Divine Master

——

“Expensive, too expensive.” Jian Wushuang secretly praised.

However, he also knew that a standard magic weapon of the third-grade superior holy treasure level would be much more powerful than an ordinary standard magic weapon of the third-grade holy treasure level.

“The Divine Earth Fruit has given me 50 million sacred elixirs at one go. In addition to the reward I got from completing the three-star mission with the Xue Dong King and the reward I got after killing the three Saint Shadows, I have a lot of sacred elixirs. Even if I have to leave 15 million sacred elixirs for the middle four forms of the reincarnation sword formation, I still have a lot left.”

“If you want to buy, buy the best.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up and he immediately looked at the golden light figure in front of him. “Sir Tianshou, I’ve decided to buy a standard magic weapon of the third-grade superior holy treasure level with 1,500,000 sacred elixirs each. I want 18 of them.”

“18 of them means 27,000,000 sacred elixirs. In addition to the 2,000,000 you used to buy the divine power fruit, you still have 21,000,000 sacred elixirs,” Sir Tianshou said.

“I also need some treasures that are useful for comprehending the rules of space-time and reincarnation, which can help me to comprehend them,” Jian Wushuang said.

He already had three heaven-sealing maps, which had been very helpful to him in comprehending the rules.

However, the heaven-sealing maps only allowed him to use the profound mysteries of heaven and earth to deduce and comprehend faster. However, there were some special treasures in heaven and earth that consumed energy, which was very helpful in comprehending the rules.

The Divine Earth Fruit, for example, belonged to such a treasure, but it was obviously of a higher level.

Lord Tianshuo quickly organized an inventory and handed it to Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang carefully browsed through it and selected a few treasures. In this way, he spent another four million sacred elixirs, leaving only 17 million sacred elixirs, he planned to keep the 17 million sacred elixirs until he became an earth-level member.

“You can wait in this nest for a while. The things you want and the remaining sacred elixirs will be delivered to you in ten days,” Lord Tianshou said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, looking forward to it.

Next, it was time for Xue Dong King to choose the treasures.

Xue Dong King could also get 50 million sacred elixirs, so he had to make full use of them.

In the end, he also chose several treasures and used two secret skills, spending nearly 40 million sacred elixirs.

It could be said that they had squandered a lot of their sacred elixirs.

After selecting the sacred elixirs, they waited quietly in the nest.

Sure enough, on the fifth day, someone delivered the things they had bought to them.

Then, they went to find a place to cultivate in seclusion.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat quietly with his legs crossed. In front of him were purple fruits that emitted a delicate fragrance.

The fruit was not big, only the size of an infant’s fist. However, it contained a lot of pure divine power.

“Is this the divine power fruit?”

Looking at the purple fruits in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with a strange light. After hesitating for a long time, he finally reached out his hand, grabbed one of the divine power fruits, and swallowed it.

The divine power fruit melted as soon as it entered Jian Wushuang’s stomach and turned into a vast amount of pure divine power that flowed in his body.

There was too much divine power and it was too vast.

“Indeed, just as Lord Tianshou said, an earth-level divine power fruit has a vast amount of pure divine power. Consuming one fruit is equivalent to absorbing three million sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with surprise, he immediately began to refine the divine power fruit.

In less than an hour, the pure power contained in the divine power fruit had been completely absorbed by him. He could clearly sense that the divine power in his body had increased by a level compared to before.

“At this speed, I’m afraid that I won’t need more than a few divine power fruits before the accumulation of divine power in my body reaches its peak.”

Jian Wushuang was a little excited and immediately began to consume the remaining divine power fruits.

One, two, five…

Jian Wushuang had spent two million sacred elixirs to exchange for 20 divine power fruits from Lord Tianshou.

However, in reality, he did not need 20 divine power fruits at all. Just by consuming the seventh divine power fruit, Jian Wushuang’s divine power had exceeded his limit and he had broken through the bottleneck.

Yes, Jian Wushuang had broken through.

He had broken through from an Advanced Divine Master to a Peak Divine Master.

This step was only a small realm, but it still greatly improved Jian Wushuang’s strength.

…

Jian Wushuang stood proudly on a vast sea, and in front of him was a small island that was only a few hundred miles in size.

Looking at the island, Jian Wushuang’s body began to surge with divine power.

He did not use any swordsmanship or any techniques. He just formed a palm with one hand and clapped it forward.

The palm contained divine power that had reached the level of a Peak Great Divine Master. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Boom! The sky and earth changed color.

The palm was infinitely enlarged and covered the entire island.

As the palm descended, the small island in the middle of the sea, which was only a few hundred miles wide, was crushed. The earth trembled and countless waves were swept up crazily.

In the blink of an eye, the island had disappeared.

“Such power!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

He did not use any means at all. He just relied on divine power to easily crush the island in front of him.

This was impossible before he made the breakthrough.

“In terms of the strength of my divine power, I’m now six or seven times stronger than an Advanced Great Divine Master.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Although the increase of six or seven times might not necessarily mean that Jian Wushuang’s overall strength had also increased by six or seven times, his battle strength had greatly increased.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang moved his mind.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Streaks of gray streamers rushed out. These gray streamers shuttled rapidly in the void. It was impossible to see the specific trajectory of their convergence with the naked eye. However, under Jian Wushuang’s control, in just a moment…the streaks of gray streamers floated in front of him and stopped.

These streams of gray light were actually gray magic swords. Each of these gray magic swords was only about two feet long. The edges of the swords were very thin, but they contained the power of reincarnation and the aura of a treasure. They were extremely powerful.

There was a faint gray airflow around the swords. It felt like a gray fog.
