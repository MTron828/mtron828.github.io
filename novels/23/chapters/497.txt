Chapter 498: Being a Joke?

Floating above the area, stood a dozen towering figures with vigorous auras.

“Your honors, the Heart-killing Sword Technique can’t be learned from others, so I’m sure Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian know the location of Sword Ancestor’s mansion and gained the technique inside,” Su Ming explained.

The dozen figures immediately looked toward Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian.

Boom! Terrifying power came rushing towards the father and the son.

Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and Blind Emperor were struck with horror under the power.

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, I’ve heard of you from one of my disciples,” A bald elder spoke slowly. His body seemed as cold as a stone.

He was none other than Stone Ancestor, one of the Three Ancestors.

“You may still remember that disciple, Jiu Xiu,” Stone Ancestor continued.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian looked grave when they heard the name.

They did remember Jiu Xiu. After all, he?was a person they would never forget.

“Jiu Xiu thought highly of you two, especially you, Jian Wushuang. He said that you were barely 30. At such a young age, you must have gained some great opportunities to raise your power to such a high level in such a short time,” Stone Ancestor said with a smile.

“As for the opportunities, I’m sure you must have gained them in Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion.”

Stone Ancestor’s words made sense. No matter how talented Jian Wushuang was, he could not have become as powerful as he was now without proper opportunities.

What Stone Ancestor did not know was that the greatest opportunity Jian Wushuang acquired was the Heavenly Creation Skill. Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion was second.

“So, tell me, where is Sword Ancestor’s mansion?” Holy Ancestor, a white-robed elder, asked gently, however, his eyes were chilling.

“Tell me or go to hell.”

The other elders gazed at Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian with eager eyes.

They were desperate to get Sword Ancestor’s treasure, regardless of the cost.

Experts like Blood Bladesman, Bagu Cave Master, and Dong Ming King were all from other places, but they had stayed in the Divine Land for a thousand years just for the treasure, and the treasure now lay in Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion.

Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and Blind Emperor could feel the elders’ eagerness.

“Jian Nantian.”

Blind Emperor turned his unfocused eyes to Jian Nantian and said, “We can’t tell them the location of Master’s mansion, even if we have to die here.”

“I Understand,” Jian Nantian nodded seriously.

“Father, Emperor, I have one trump card, which may help us survive this time,” Jian Wushuang chimed in.

“Oh?” Jian Nantian turned to Jian Wushuang. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang looked grave. His trump card was the Jade Slip Leng Rushuang had given him.

Leng Rushuang had told him that she would come to help him once he crumbled the Jade Slip.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was in a situation where he could not get out of trouble on his own, and Leng Rushuang was his only hope.

Without hesitating, Jian Wushuang took out the slip and held it tightly.

“Leng Rushuang, if you can save us this time, I’ll repay you even if the price is ten times greater.”

Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice and crumbled the slip.

Immediately, the surrounding space rippled.

Jian Wushuang stared at it with expectation.

The elders saw Jian Wushuang’s action, but they did not take it seriously.

They were super experts in this world and had managed to kill Sword Ancestor a thousand years ago, so they did not care about a little boy’s trump card.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly darkened.

“How can it be like this?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised that nothing happened.

He had crushed the slip and there had been a ripple, but after that, nothing happened.

Leng Rushuang did not come.

“What’s going on?” Jian Nantian looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“I don’t know.” Jian Wushuang frowned as worry burned inside him.

After he crushed the jade slip, there was only a small response and no one appeared.?At this moment, his actions looked like a joke.

“Haha, what an idiot!” Su Ming laughed.

The experts all sneered at Jian Wushuang.

“What is he doing? Was he asking someone for help when he crushed that slip? But, nobody came.”

“Is he trying to deceive himself?”

“Maybe it’s true that he was seeking help, but the owner of the slip didn’t reply. The owner must be afraid to face the Three Ancestors and the elders.”

“It’s not his fault. He is only a young boy. Who could he ask to help him? Moreover, who could even help him?”

Many eyes of pity were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Suddenly, a snorting sound echoed and caused everyone to quiet down.

The sound was from a barefoot middle-aged man, one of the super experts. The man’s aura was overbearing, which implied that he was a bad-tempered man.

The man was called Bagu Cave Master.

“Boy, it seems that the person you are asking for help from is a coward.

“Stop struggling, boy. Tell me where the Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion is and I’ll ensure your safety. But, if you dare to tell it to the others, I’ll kill you, your family, and everyone who is related to you!”

Bagu Cave Master’s chilling and threatening voice resounded through the area.

His words obviously annoyed the other experts on the scene who all frowned.

“Bagu Cave Master, you’re in the Divine Land. As a stranger here, you are being too arrogant,” Holy Ancestor’s said in a deep voice.

“Arrogant? Yes, I am, so what?” Bagu Cave Master sneered.

“Bagu Cave Master, don’t be so...” Holy Ancestor shouted coldly and looked toward him, but he stopped speaking halfway, staring in a dumbfounded manner.

Not only him, but also Spirit Ancestor, Stone Ancestor, Blood Bladesman, and all the others who looked at Bagu Cave Master were dumbfounded.

“What? What are you trying to say?” Bagu Cave Master was still displaying his domineering manner.

“Bagu Cave Master, look behind you...”
