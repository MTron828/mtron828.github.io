Chapter 2577: Prized Possession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Countless cultivators around the Combat Ring gathered there included experts from various clans.

Everyone had their eyes on the center of the Combat Ring.

A huge Golden Prison floated there.

Not only did the Golden Prison block their sight, but also encumbered their soul powers and caused them to have no idea what was happening inside the Golden Prison.

On the sides of the Golden Prison, the military formations formed from the Official Army’s two battalions were frantically attacking the Golden Prison and trying to pry it open under the leadership of both commanders. However, Jian Wushuang drew up the Golden Prison with his full divine power intensity, making the Golden Prison extremely rigid and impenetrable.

Even if the Official Army had given up on destroying the Golden Prison and aimed to just crack a hole in it, they would only succeed if they had the powers of a High-Level Earth Ultimate God. The military formations formed by both battalions were powerful but incomplete nonetheless. The strongest power each military formation was able to unleash was equivalent to a top-tier Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God which was a far cry from the required High-Level Earth Ultimate God’s power.

Besides, the Golden Prison is capable of self-restoration.

Therefore, they failed to blow a hole into the Golden Prison despite both military formations taking turns repeatedly bombarding the Golden Prison.

The Official Army was discouraged and felt helpless by their failure.

In the Golden Prison’s center, Jian Wushuang indifferently stood and faced San Shouwang.

San Shouwang was trembling physically and mentally with his eyes flashing crazily in horror, but he was still able to maintain a calm composure although knowing of his plight. It was because he was a High-Level Earth Ultimate God expert after all.

“Who on earth are you?” San Shouwang stared at Jian Wushuang.

“It doesn’t matter who I am, but you ought to know you would’ve been dead if I wanted to kill you earlier.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth and San Shouwang knew it.

Jian Wushuang could have destroyed San Shouwang in his previous sword movement but changed his mind at the last minute.

“What exactly do you want then?” San Shouwang asked in a low voice.

“I have a question for you.” Jian Wushuang looked down at San Shouwang. The latter was seriously injured almost to the point of death. His combat power was less than ten percent of his normal capacity and could not possibly escape Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang was also not in a hurry to take San Shouwang’s life.

“Not long ago, the Xiao Clan had a special treasure which attracted your attention. You took ownership of the treasure after destroying the Xiao Clan. You still have it, don’t you? Where is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Xiao Clan’s treasure?” San Shouwang was startled before smiling coldly. “I was wondering why someone like you that can defeat a High-Level Earth Ultimate God while being at the Peak Ultimate God Realm is interested in the Territorial Lord position when you could’ve joined some more powerful sects—such as the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion—for a better future. Your real purpose isn’t the Territorial Lord position but to get your hands on the Xiao Clan’s treasure!”

Jian Wushuang looked calm.

San Shouwang was right. He was not interested in the slightest with the Territorial Lord position.

Even if he became one, it was merely a route to gain more Primordial Stones to improve his cultivation realm.

The reasons why Jian Wushaung marked the Territorial Lord and tried to kill him was to get revenge for Xiao Tiexin and most part The Stately Painting!

It was his prized possession!

“Tsk, tsk, Jian Yi. Although I don’t know why you’re interested in that piece of treasure, I have to tell you that you’re too late. I no longer have it.” San Shouwang laughed.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold as his powerful divine powers oppressed San Shouwang.

San Shouwang who was already shaking profusely and fell on his knees in front of Jian Wushuang as soon as the mighty divine power started oppressing him.

His face turned ghastly pale but still kept his head up and sneered. “I didn’t lie to you. The Xiao Clan’s treasure is very special and must be very remarkable. Unfortunately, I was unable to take ownership and had no way of refining it, so it was of no use for me to keep. Instead of keeping it in the Interspatial Ring, I sold it in exchange for a secret technique manual I wanted.”

Jian Wushuang had his eyes locked on San Shouwang the entire time and knew that San Shouwang was not lying judging from his expression changes.

He had indeed sold The Stately Painting!

“The matter that worries me the most has happened.” Jian Wushuang unconsciously clenched his fists. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He was rather worried when he knew The Stately Painting had fallen into San Shouwang’s hands.

Even an Undying Saint was unable to refine The Stately Painting, so what more could he expect from an Ultimate God.

The treasure was of no use if it could not be refined and he suspected that San Shouwang might have possibly sold it in exchange for fortunes or favors.

That was the reason he did not kill San Shouwang earlier. Jian Wushuang was cautious enough to keep San Shouwang alive and find out about the treasure’s exact location.

“Who did you sell the treasure to?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Hehe, why should I tell you? Will you spare me if I tell you?” San Shouwang sneered.

“Well, you can choose not to tell but I know other ways to make you speak.” Jian Wushuang kept a straight face. A vast soul power that targeted San Shouwang swept out in an instant the minute he finished talking.

“S-soul manipulation? You know how to attack the soul?” San Shouwang’s expression drastically changed.

“Hmph, do you think you can read me?” Jian Wushuang sneered as his soul power amplified.

“No, stop! I’ll say it, I’ll say it.” San Shouwang immediately pleaded loudly as he was unable to resist the attacks. He was worried that Jian Wushuang would gain control of his soul which would be worse than killing him!

Jian Wushuang slowed down.

“I gave the treasure to my eldest brother who is the Star Picking Pavilion’s Golden Chief and is quite powerful in the Star Picking Pavilion. After I gave him the treasure, he immediately handed it to the Star Picking Pavilion in exchange for four million Primordial Stones which we split evenly between ourselves.

“Not long ago, I hear the Star Picking Pavilion will hold a large-scale auction in the Narcissus Territory and put the treasure up for auction around eleven years later.”
