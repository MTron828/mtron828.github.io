Chapter 5422 ¬†Hu Qing's Chance Encounter

It could also be considered a culmination of accumulated efforts.

Since entering the Great Desolate Wilderness until now, in just a few millennia, he had progressed from Yan Immortal to the strength of slaying a tier 5 Emperor.

It's worth noting that in the Original Universe, the strongest were only tier 5 Emperors.

This time, they opened a massive relic, a path to breakthroughs in the Dao of the Sword and the Extreme Dao lay ahead.

He had to seize this opportunity.

Jian Wushuang took a step and followed everyone through the dazzling entrance of a spatial gate.

As they entered the relic, Hu Qing, who had already penetrated deep into the Western Sea, arrived at a desolate island guided by Jiang Shang.

This island was inhabited by many mortals, making a living by fishing in the sea.

The arrival of Master Hu Qing and his disciples earned the respect of the island's inhabitants. In the Inner Sea, there had always been a legend that the extreme of the Western Sea led to the Western Heaven, where a sacred Buddha existed.

This time in the Inner Sea, Hu Qing also wanted to go to the Western Heaven for contemplation.

However, halfway there, Jiang Shang suddenly sensed a trace of aura.

Jiang Shang exclaimed, "Master, I can deduce that this aura is related to your Dao Merge!"

"Dao Merge? Are you talking about Dao integration?" Hu Qing was surprised. His trip to the Western Heaven was for Dao discussions; if he won, he would integrate his Dao; if he lost, he would return to the Grave God Mountain.

But he hadn't expected that halfway through the journey, his disciple would deduce an opportunity for Dao integration in this place.

However, there was still a vague scene of confusion about the Dao in his mind!

"Did I make a mistake?" Hu Qing murmured.

He was confident about everything until Jiang Shang appeared and shattered it all.

The current Jiang Shang possessed the Spirit of Grass and Wood, advancing in realm without any bottlenecks, surpassing him and becoming an Emperor.

With a wave of Jiang Shang's hand, the Spirit of Grass and Wood transformed into a child, lying on her shoulders. The little one had a halo floating above its head, darting around Jiang Shang.

"Little one, you've grown again!" Jiang Shang teased the child with her fingers. Apart from her master, this was her second close relative.

Upon seeing the child, Hu Qing also revealed a faint smile and said, "Let's go and take a look then."

The two of them disappeared on the small island.

When they reappeared, they were outside a black hole in the depths of the sea.

Hu Qing had reached perfection, both in cultivation and understanding of the space at the stellar level.

He was well acquainted with black holes.

"Right inside here!" Jiang Shang pointed at the miniature black hole.

Without hesitation, Hu Qing stepped forward and entered the black hole.

Multicolored lights flashed around him. Hu Qing couldn't tell if he was moving forward or if these lights were rushing toward him from behind.

"Master, I seem to sense an evil aura, right in front of us!" Jiang Shang's expression changed.

The aura was familiar to her, reminding her of the puppet with the same essence.

It had the same aura as the one who had killed her brother.

Hu Qing's brow furrowed slightly. It was already miraculous enough for a black hole to appear in this place, and now there were people inside!

The two individuals maintained their speed, if not accelerating.

"Almost there, just ahead!"

As they drew closer, a strange expression crossed Hui Qing's face. He found the aura quite familiar.

Could it be?

Until he saw the figure's back, Hu Qing was stunned. The silhouette was familiar, but there were slight changes in the aura. However, the sharpness of the Sword Qi confirmed everything.

It was indeed Jian Wushuang!

In this mottled and colorful space, the Jian Wushuang on the pathway was the same Jian Wushuang who had entered the black hole from the Mo Luo border.

Hu Qing could spot Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang's projection couldn't perceive Hu Qing.

The spatial distance between them was considerable. Even though they could see each other, the actual distance was vast.

Hu Qing also realized that approaching Jian Wushuang was impossible.

"Brother Wushuang!" Hui Qing shouted.

But the Jian Wushuang ahead couldn't hear a thing.

Jiang Shang's eyes showed hesitation, but in the end, she remained silent.

Meanwhile, within the black hole, Jian Wushuang not only didn't hear Hu Qing's shout but also remained oblivious to anyone approaching.

He was still drifting, comprehending the mysteries within the black hole.

"Is this the universe?"

The scene Jian Wushuang's projection observed was entirely different from what Hu Qing saw.

Upon entering the depths of the black hole, Jian Wushuang discovered that as he approached the source, he could comprehend the power of the universe.

It was a realm higher than the black hole itself.

The connection with the cosmic Origin Source had a peculiar similarity to when they had devoured the universe's Origin Source.

"Master, we don't belong to the same universe as him. It's just that these black holes are born within the universe, creating a mutual link."

¬†Between universes, the space may be similar, but time is different.

When they saw Jian Wushuang, it wasn't the current Jian Wushuang in this world. It was highly likely that it was Jian Wushuang from a thousand years ago who came here.

Hu Qing couldn't comprehend these rules. After staring blankly for a while, he gritted her teeth and rushed through the colorful boundary.

Splash!

The two entered the edge of an ancient battlefield.

Jiang Shang's bright eyes showed a hint of joy. "This is it!" DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

At the same time, the true body of Jian Wushuang, along with many other powerhouses, arrived at this ancient battlefield, with a considerable distance separating the two sides.

Upon entering the ancient battlefield, everyone surveyed the surroundings.

Ruins, the corpses of exotic beasts scattered everywhere, damaged golden skeletons, and even colorful skeletons. There were also numerous discarded weapons, such as long swords, war hammers, and cold spears, all of which had long lost their former power and turned into scrap metal.

The sight was shocking.

Even Bai Junwang, who had broad knowledge, couldn't help shaking his head.

The fallen ones on this ancient battlefield were emperors, and not just any emperors, but powerful ones.

In such a vast battlefield with countless corpses, how many powerhouses had fallen?

No one knew.

Even the treasures had lost their luster, indicating that this battlefield might date back to ancient times.

Suddenly, a tier 5 Emperor exclaimed, "It's a supreme Eternal Treasure!"

Then, swiftly and decisively, he tried to pull it from one of the corpses.

"Don't move!" Bai Junwang roared, but it was already too late.

The corpse that was being pulled, its originally dim eyes suddenly began to flicker.

One...

Two...

Three...

Countless corpses instantly came alive.

Even a peak-level tier 6 Emperor couldn't help but find the scene shocking.

Hmm.

Strange corpses slowly rose, roaring in a language unfamiliar to all of them.

Even more peculiar was that these corpses didn't attack them but instead rushed towards the depths of the battlefield.

This relieved the group.

Gui Ling and the others had never witnessed such a scene; they were almost ready to take action.

Fortunately, Bai Junwang stopped them.

They stood amidst the gaps between those corpses, silently watching them charge into the fray.

What immense willpower this must be‚Äîhaving fallen for countless years, yet their bodies were still charging into battle.

Jian Wushuang was also puzzled. He walked to Bai Junwang's side and quietly asked, "Are these corpses followers of that Fuego or members of the Three Kings Court?"

"They are not the Heavenly Lords of the Three Kings Court," Bai Junwang shook his head and continued, "The Three Kings Court once recruited numerous Heavenly Lords, that is, Emperor-level powerhouses. However, these corpses have a different aura from those Heavenly Lords."
