Chapter 1797: The Mastermind

The Eighteen Asura Hell was a soul attack Secret Skill that was used specially to torture people.

For the person who was attacked, if his consciousness were not strong enough and he was unable to block or fight his way out of the Secret Skill, what awaited him would be endless torture.

For this Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang used it frequently when he was still a Universe God. However, ever since he had made a breakthrough to become an Ultimate Real God, he rarely used it.

Although he did not use it frequently, he had long mastered this Secret Skill completely when his absolute abilities were combined with his current Soul level.

By unleashing it then, what awaited the bald-headed man was torture from eighteen hells.

“AHHHHH!!!!”

Hysterical roars could be heard from the bald-headed man. The bald-headed man’s eyes had turned a scarlet color a long time ago and he was completely insane.

“No, no!”

“Spare my life, please spare my life!!”

“I beg of you!!”

The bald-headed man had started to beg for his life crazily.

As Jian Wushuang’s Soul level increased, the tortures would become more frightening when the Secret Skill was unleashed. It was unleashed with Jian Wushuang’s full power and even top experts in the Real God ranking list might be unable to endure the hell’s torture in the Secret Skill, let alone the bald-headed man.

Madness and hysteria.

Everyone that moment could see the bald-headed man’s expression clearly.

With regards to that, no one from the Green Fire Palace pitied him in the slightest. Instead, they were extremely delighted and excited like never before.

For the past few years, the Green Fire Palace had been suppressed badly by the Devil Church.

Their hatred of the Devil Church was definitely not weaker than of the Jin Kingdom back then.

As for the bald-headed man, he was the boss of the thirteen Devil Bloods in the Devil Church and he was experiencing a great amount of pain from the torture. As for his twelve other brothers, all of them were killed.

After a long time, the bald-headed man experienced all kinds of tortures in the eighteen hells and his consciousness had also started to recover slowly.

However, at that moment, he was completely exhausted and his face had long become twisted to its maximum. Moreover, his eyes were still scarlet like before.

“Kill me, I beg of you to kill me!”

A soft voice could be heard from the bald-headed man. He had already lost all hope.

At that moment, he only wished to die quickly. With that, he would be freed.

“Do you think that it will be so easy for you to die?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly. After that, the Blood Mountain Sword behind him left its scabbard abruptly.

Buzz~~~

The Blood Mountain Sword turned into a lofty mountain instantly and suppressed the bald-headed man, the First Devil Blood, right away.

With the First Devil Blood suppressed, the whole universe became deathly silent temporarily.

However, at the next moment, there was a huge uproar.

The uproar naturally came from the Green Fire Palace. At that moment, a large number of experts in the Green Fire Palace were roaring hysterically and quite a number of them were crying tears of joy.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A great number of figures headed toward Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Old Three!”

“Old Three!”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang with tears.

Similarly, everyone else was extremely emotional.

“Dead. The thirteen Devil Bloods are all dead!”

“The thirteen devils are finally dead.”

“Haha, great, this is great. With the death of the thirteen Devil Bloods, the Devil Church can be destroyed in a split second. With that, the Green Fire World will regain its peace.”

A huge number of experts spoke in succession and their eyes which were looking at Jian Wushuang were scorching hot and also filled with adoration.

However, upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang shook his head, “This matter has not come to a complete end yet.”

“Eh?”

Jian Nantian and the rest of the people looked at Jian Wushaung with surprise.

The thirteen Devil Bloods were already dead. Hence, wouldn’t the Devil Church not have any room to struggle at all?

Why had it not ended yet?

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. Instead, he turned his body slowly and continued heading toward the lofty Devil City.

In no time, he appeared at the void on top of the Devil City and he looked down with his icy-cold eyes.

“Even though you have witnessed your subordinates being killed by me one by one, you still remained indifferent. You are really able to bear with all of this?” Jian Wushuang’s loud voice resounded across the whole universe.

His voice spread in all directions and flooded each and every corner of the Devil City.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, everyone from the Green Fire Palace opened their eyes wide.

Weren’t the strongest people in the Devil Church the thirteen Devil Bloods?

“Could it be…” Wang Yuan’s heart beat fiercely.

After Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated across the area, the Devil City below him was still extremely peaceful like before and there were no changes.

“Haha, you are still trying to deceive yourself and all of us. Forget it. Since you are unwilling to come out, I shall drag you out,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically. Divine Power then gathered in his hands and he swung his palm out toward the bottom abruptly.

Rumble~~~ The palm expanded quickly in the void and it became a big hand which could blot out the sky and the run instantly, covering the whole Devil City as a result.

The giant palm descended and countless buildings of the huge Devil City, as well as some cultivators of the Devil Church who still stayed in the Devil City, were turned into fine powder.

Frightening power spread in all directions madly and in just an instant, the Devil City disappeared.

What replaced it was a huge and boundless pit. The pit was in complete darkness and bottomless as well.

However, at the same time that the pit appeared, an extremely powerful aura which was similar to that of a gigantic dragon awakened slowly at the deepest part of the pit.

Frightening aura flooded the whole area. In no time, the color of the universe changed and the whole void was covered with a kind of dense crimson cloud instantly.

After that, a tattered Taoist-robed stalwart old man rose slowly and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in the end.

Upon seeing the person who had come, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank.

As for the experts of the Green Fire Palace, all of them turned pale with fright.

As expected!

The Devil Church still had someone who was more powerful!

“I thought that my way of concealing myself was extremely superb and I should be able to escape your soul’s examination. How did you notice me?” the stalwart Taoist-robed old man asked.

“It’s simple. Firstly, it’s the thirteen Devil Bloods. Although they had become Real Gods, their auras were a lot weaker than other people’s who were of a similar realm as them. Moreover, their foundations were extremely weak. If my guess is not wrong, they had entered the realm of Real Gods with the help of some great techniques of someone else. As for the abilities that they originally possessed, they should be so weak that it was depressing!”

“In addition, the most important thing was the big formation of the Devil City. While the big formation looked as though it was a defensive formation deployed to guard against anything unexpected, I could tell with a glance that it was a huge Spirit Collecting Great Formation that collected the infinite amount of spiritual power of the universe. Moreover, the location that the spiritual power was gathered to was not outside the Devil City. Instead, it was at the deepest part of the Devil City.”

“By combining the two points above, I came to the conclusion that a real expert definitely existed in the deepest part of the Devil City. As for the thirteen Devil Bloods, they were merely puppets. Looking at it now, I was right!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, the only thing that I did not expect was that the expect who controlled the thirteen Devil Bloods would actually be you!”

“Dao Yuanzi!!!”

Murderous intent emerged in Jian Wushuang’s eyes hastily.
