Chapter 647: The Arena Battle Ends

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As the fighting went on, Jian Wushuang moved to the outside of the battlefield to stand with Feng, side by side, watching the fighting quietly.

“It’s a pity that you encountered Gong Chao so early, otherwise you would have had a chance to make it into the top two among everyone,” Feng said to Jian Wushuang flatly while looking at him.

Jian Wushuang replied with a smile, “It’s also a pity that you encountered Qianqiu Wuhen, or you would have made it into the top five.”

Both of them had the bad luck of encountering someone who was more powerful than them.

“Whatever, our business is done in the arena battle,” Jian Wushuang said reluctantly.

Their journey in that battle ended with them being ranked inside the top 20.

As they were watching, the fight for the top 10 was over, and all the 10 winners could get 100,000 Divine Gems as a prize for their rankings. In no time, those people started fighting for the top three.

Half a day passed during these hot battles, and finally, the arena battle ended. The list of the top three geniuses came out, which was based on the participants’ performances.

Without question, Gong Chao was number one.

He was so powerful that Jian Wushuang was the only one who had been able to force him to try his hardest. The others all lost to him before he even had to show his real power.

As for the number two expert, people had thought it should be Qianqiu Wuhen. However, it turned out to be a slovenly girl who had attracted little attention during the previous rounds and unexpectedly defeated Qianqiu Wuhen with a burst of her power in the last round. The girl was named Jing Xianzi.

Qianqiu Wuhen was ranked number three.

In fact, everyone present knew that if Jian Wushuang had not met Gong Chao during the battle, he could have taken Qianqiu Wuhen’s place in the rankings.

“The girl named Jing Xianzi has really got some power,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He had witnessed the fight between her and Qianqiu Wuhen and was astonished by her power.

“She is indeed mighty with a gift in the Waterdrop Dao. However, you can absolutely overpower her if you battle her with your Original Body and doppelganger at the same time,” Feng chimed in.

“Maybe.” Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

As soon as the arena battle was over, experts from every sect immediately started recruiting new disciples.

The top three geniuses all received invitations from the three magnates, while the others within the top 10 were sought after by some other top sects.

And as for Jian Wushuang and Feng, the outstanding two in the battle, they had not received an invitation from any sect—not even from a medium-sized one.

“It shouldn’t be like this.”?Jian Wushuang frowned.

Although he was from the Ancient World, he believed that his performance in the battle was good enough to earn him an invitation from a top sect.

As he was lost in confusion, he got a message from the token that Xuan Yi had given him.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll have you be our inner disciple, so go to the Ancient Sect with me.”

The information was clear, Xuan Yi would give him a place among their inner disciples. But aside from this, nothing else, such as the guidance of the Eternal Realm experts, was promised.

“To be an inner disciple of the Ancient Sect?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Feng and Huo Ying standing beside him received a message from Xuan Yi as well, and they looked very happy.

Jian Wushuang looked at them and asked, “What are your results?”

“I’ve been accepted as an inner disciple,” Feng answered with joy.

“So have I!” Huo Ying cried out excitedly.

Obviously, Xuan Yi had accepted all of them as inner disciples. And to them, this was as good of a chance as it was to be the inner disciples of the three magnates.

“And what about you three?” Jian Wushuang turned to Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang behind him.

Those three had been kicked out during the first round of the arena battle, but they had chosen to wait in the Drill Ground since then.

The three of them exchanged glances before Bing Shan replied, “We only got invitations as outer disciples.”

“That’s not bad,” Huo Ying said to comfort them.

“Yeah.” Those three nodded with looks of satisfaction on their faces.

The Ancient Sect was even greater than the three magnates in some way; therefore, what they could gain from the sect as outer disciples would be no less than if they were inner disciples of other top sects.

“I can’t wait to cultivate in the Ancient Sect.” Wu Huang clenched his hands.

“Be patient. The Firmament Territory Feast isn’t over and the fourth round of genius battles is yet to begin.” Feng laughed at him.

However, those words reminded Jian Wushuang of what the host had said, that there were four rounds of genius battles in total. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At that moment, the fourth round was yet to begin.

Normally, as all remarkable geniuses had been selected out during the first three rounds, there was no need to hold a fourth round, so the Firmament Territory Feast would come to an end at this point.

This matter confused Jian Wushuang very much.?“What is exactly the purpose of the fourth round?”

All the geniuses who had survived the third round were gathered on the Drill Ground, and they all shared the same feeling as Jian Wushuang.

As if he had seen through those geniuses’ confusion, the host looked around and explained to them. “The fourth round of genius battles is the most important part of the Firmament Territory Feast, and everyone who has participated in the arena battle could participate in this round as well.”

“The most important part?”?The geniuses were surprised. The next moment, the host’s voice echoed again.

“As all of you know, the aim of the previous three rounds is to examine your power, but in fact, one’s current power could not be a determinant of whether he is talented or not. Therefore, the purpose of the fourth round is to discover the talent and potential in you.

“And the results of this round will only be decided by time.” The host’s voice was loud and clear.

“By time?”?The geniuses were even more confused.
