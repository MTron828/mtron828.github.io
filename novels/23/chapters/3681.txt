Chapter 3683: Everything Is Ready!

“Get up.”

Jian Wushuang put his hands behind his back and looked coldly at these people who were begging for mercy. “I only want to kill the three Saint Realms. As for the four Divine Clans and the Eight Directions Celestial Sect, I won’t pursue it. After I open the passage, you can leave.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang ignored them and left.

Seeing Jian Wushuang leave, they let out a long sigh.

“Mr. Xuan Yan, and everyone from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect.”

Jian Wushuang came to the Seven Star Mysterious Sect and said, “Before opening the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm, I have to tell you something.”

“What is it?” Xuan Yan looked at him.

“The Fourth Heaven, where the Seven Star Divine Realm used to be, has become completely desolate because of the operation of the World Array. It’s completely isolated from the other territories of the Divine Beginning Realm. Therefore, even if you return to the Divine Beginning Realm now, it’s impossible for you to return to the Fourth Heaven,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The Fourth Heaven has been completely destroyed?”

Hearing this news, the people of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect found it hard to accept.

“But don’t worry. Although you can’t go to the Fourth Heaven, I will arrange a new place for you so that the Seven Star Mysterious Sect can make a comeback,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Where to?” Xuan Yan asked.

“The Third Heaven, the nest of the three Saint Realms!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“What?” Everyone from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was stunned.

The taciturn Di Shisan frowned, he said, “Jian Wushuang, although the Seven Star Mysterious Sect has a blood feud with the three Saint Realms, all the experts under the Seven Star Mysterious Sect want to uproot the three Saint Realms and turn the three Saint Realm Masters into ashes

“However, there are only these people left in our Seven Star Mysterious Sect. Each of them has been asleep for too long, so they are still at their weakest. If we go to confront the three Saint Realms now, it would be like hitting a rock with an egg.”

The experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect agreed with Di Shisan’s words.

Now, the remaining top experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were all here, and they were all at their weakest stage. Even if they went to the Divine Beginning Realm, they would not be able to fully recover in a short time. Even if they were able to fully recover…facing the three Saint Realms, they would have no choice but to flee in embarrassment.

Naturally, they could not face the three Saint Realms head-on now.

“Everyone, the reason why I said that I would place you in the Third Heaven, in the nest of the three Saint Realms, is because soon...today, the day you return to the Divine Beginning Realm, the three Saint Realms will no longer exist,” Jian Wushuang said.

When he said this, everyone from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, including the cultivators from the four Divine Clans and the Eight Directions Celestial Sect, turned pale with fright.

“Jian Wushuang, do you mean that you really intend to completely destroy the three Saint Realms?” Xuan Yan looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“Can’t I?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Xuan Yan.

“Yes, but the three Saint Realms are not weak. Even at the peak of our Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the three Saint Realms can fight us head-on. Now that our Seven Star Mysterious Sect has been destroyed for so many years, the three Saint Realms must be the strongest in the Divine Beginning Realm. Their accumulated strength must be even stronger!”

“Besides, the three masters of the Saint Realm are supported by the will of the Heavenly Dao. Any one of them can be said to be invincible in the Divine Beginning Realm. Even the Rulers can’t do anything to them. With such strength, how can we destroy them?” Xuan Yan asked.

“How to destroy the three Saint Realms...don’t worry, I’ll let you see it with your own eyes.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and did not explain much.

“Everyone, please wait here for a moment. Let me go to the Divine Beginning Realm to make arrangements.”

With that, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and disappeared into the world. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the Fourth Heaven, the huge magic formation was still there and was still slowly operating.

Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master had also been waiting there. Although Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Eternal Chaotic World for a full ten years, the flow of time in the Eternal Chaotic World was completely different from that in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Ten years had passed in the Eternal Chaotic World, but only a month had passed in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang rushed out of the formation and appeared in front of Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master.

“My young friend, you’ve come out so quickly. Have you seen your relatives?” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

“I’ve seen them all.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “Temporal, Heaven-cleaving, have you prepared what I asked you to prepare?”

“Don’t worry. After receiving your message, I, Zhantian, and Desolate Emperor immediately gave the order to prepare. So far, the Heavenly-cleaving Alliance, the Temporal Temple, and the divine ancestor Daoist sect have all been prepared. As soon as you give the order, all the Principles Masters of the three freedom alliances will lead countless saints to attack the Third Heaven!”

“In addition, there are six sects in the Eight Directions Celestial Sect who are willing to stand on the side of the three freedom alliances. They have also formed an army of 100,000 saints led by dozens of Principles Masters. They will act as soon as we make a move!”

“And your good friend, Demon Master Chenhuo, has more than 10 powerful forces under his command, including the Purple Blood Sect, the Supreme Emotion Valley, and the Icefire Devil Palace. They are ready to form an allied army and attack together!”

The eyes of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master were burning with passion.

“What about the four divine races? Xiao’er hasn’t taken control of the other three divine races?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’ve asked them myself. The nine clan leaders now have the battle strength of an expert in the pinnacle of the six realm. Together with the strength of their subordinates, their overall strength has completely surpassed that of the two three divine races. Since I received your message, I immediately asked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to secretly send some experts to help them.”

“Just now, we had finished the final battle with the three divine races. Now that the battle has ended, the Nine-tailed Clan leader should have completely taken control of the other three divine races and even the entire Demon Realm,” the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said.

“That’s great.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, he said in a deep voice, “The three Saint Realms have existed for too long and are deeply rooted. It’s not easy to destroy them all at once. That’s why we must gather all our strength and not give the three Saint Realms any chance!”

“Yes!”

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master also nodded heavily.

Then, Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and the huge sealing formation in front of them shrank at a speed visible to the naked eye. Finally, it completely merged with Jian Wushuang’s body, a fierce light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Let’s...go!”
