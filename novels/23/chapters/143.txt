Within the palace.

The Temple Masters had left, but Palace Masters Black and White were sitting in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Boy. What happened? How did you survive the Abyss?” asked Palace Master White.

It was no wonder why she was so curious.

The Abyss was still a mystery. No one knew what was there.

However, anyone who fell into the Abyss, even experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, would die.

However, Jian Wushuang returned alive from the Abyss.

“I don’t know. When I fainted after I jumped into the Abyss. When I woke up, I found myself inside the Sword Tomb,” Jian Wushuang said.

“A Sword Tomb?” Palace Masters Black and White looked at each other.

“The Sword Tomb was rife with sword scars...” Jian Wushuang told them most of what happened in the Sword Tomb, only leaving out the absolute beauty?and the robust man in the Ancestor’s Land.

He told them he had accidentally entered the Sword Tomb.

After hearing what Jian Wushuang said, both Palace Masters looked astonished.

“You spent a full two years in that Sword Tomb. Besides the Sword Tomb, didn’t you explore anywhere else?” Palace Master White could not help asking.

“No, I could feel danger all around, so I did not dare to explore. Somehow, I was able to leave by entering the space rift. Then, I appeared in the Dark Forest,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Space rift? Wormhole?” The two Palace Masters stared at him with wide eyes.

The wormhole was a legendary skill.

Of course, it might also be a natural wormhole. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It seems that there is a big secret hidden in the Abyss,” said Palace Master White, sighing in praise.

“So many experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm went to explore but never returned. Yet somehow, this little guy survived. He’s quite lucky.”?Palace Master Black also smiled.

They were not very skeptical about what Jian Wushuang said.

The Abyss was a dangerous place. It was normal for Jian Wushuang to find out nothing given his current strength.

“Anyway, being able to return alive is already very fortunate, and you returned at a great time,” Palace Master White said and laughed. “A major event is about to begin. I was currently troubled by this. Now that you are back, that problem is solved.”

“A major event?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Before, in the imperial palace, Ouyang Haoyue had also mentioned it.

But he had no idea what this major event was.

“Palace Master White. What is this major event?” Jian Wushuang asked without hesitation.

“Have you heard about the Easternmost Hunt?” Palace Master White beamed.

“The Easternmost Hunt?” Jian Wushuang immediately shook his head. He had never heard anything about it.

“Well, it is a long story, so I’ll explain it,” Palace Master White smiled and slowly narrated.

“Jian Wushuang, is the Tianzong Dynasty vast?” Palace Master White asked.

“Very vast.” Jian Wushuang immediately nodded.

In his eyes, the Tianzong Dynasty was incredibly vast.

“You are right, the Tianzong dynasty is very vast.” Palace Master White also nodded and continued, “It has a total?of 16 provinces. There are many counties in these 16 provinces, so it can be said to be very vast. However... how big is the land we are on?”

“The land?” Jian Wushuang was stunned for a second and then shook his head.

“I tell you that this piece of land is called Nanyang Continent and it has endless territory. There are many dynasties on the Nanyang Continent. Tianzong dynasty is just one of the many dynasties on the Nanyang Continent!”

“And just a small empire,” Palace Master White said.

“A small empire?” Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned.

“On the entire Nanyang Continent, the dynasties have been divided into three levels according to their territorial strengths. Small empires, middle-sized empires, and large empires!” Palace Master White explained.

“Different level dynasties will have different overall strengths. Our Tianzong Dynasty is only a small empire. Among the many dynasties on the Nanyang Continent, it can be said that it is an unremarkable dynasty that nobody cares about.”

“Not far away, the territory, where the Tianzong dynasty is located, is in the northwest corner of the Nanyang Continent. There are a total of 11 dynasties around us. Of these 11 dynasties, there are two large empires, six middle-sized empires, and three other small empires!”

“The Easternmost Hunt is held every 20 years.”

“At the beginning of the Easternmost Hunt, the 12 dynasties in the northwest, including Tianzong Dynasty, will send experts to participate. The rules stipulate that those experts can only be warriors in the Gold Core Realm. Warriors in the Yin-Yang Void Realm cannot join.”

“Each Easternmost Hunt will generally attract some old sects.”

“Old sects?” Jian Wushuang asked while lifting his brow.

“In the Nanyang Continent, there are a large number of dynasties. the real overlords and rulers of this continent are from those old sects. The dynasties are merely the vassals of these sects,” Palace Master White smiled and continued.

“Some old sects will be taking part in the Easternmost Hunt, and they will also select some of the best among those who participate in the hunt. They will become core disciples instead of normal disciples. Becoming a core disciple is considered a big success. Even his dynasty will flatter them .”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was completely stunned.

The core disciples of those old sects have such a status? Even a dynasty has to fawn over them?

“Boy, there’s something you need to understand,” Palace Master White said seriously, “there is no doubt that Dragon Palace is the Holy land for cultivators in the Tianzong Dynasty. But it is only true in the Tianzong Dynasty. Outside the Tianzong dynasty and in the entire Nanyang Continent, Dragon Palace is nothing.”

“And those old sects are not...”

Jian Wushuang was surprised but it was understandable.

Although the cultivation resources in Dragon Palace were very rich, as his strength increased, Jian Wushuang gradually realized that the resources in Dragon Palace had little use for him. However, ruling the entire Nanyang Continent, the old sects would have more amazing resources.

“So, you can imagine how fortunate it is to enter the old sects and become a core disciple. Naturally, there are countless people who are eager to enter these old sects. For the 12 dynasties in the northwest, the only chance to enter them is the Easternmost Hunt...”
