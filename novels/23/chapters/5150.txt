The numerous powerful beings in the temporary alliance were closely monitoring the negotiations. If they didn’t unite, Demon Lord Fengyu wouldn’t care about them. It was possible that the Eternal Tower would directly seal off the Great Desolate Wilderness, preventing them from entering.

After a brief conversation between the two tier 4 experts, they each returned to their respective camps.

“Brother Chishui, what’s the situation? Did Demon Lord Fengyu agree?” many Emperors inquired. After all, this opportunity surpassed everything else.

In times of chaos, the struggle was for territory. Now, it was about the chance to ascend as the Lord of the universe. If one truly became the Lord of the universe and controlled the Original Universe, they would be invincible not just in the Original Universe but also in the long river of time and space.

“Friends, Fengyu has agreed. We will explore the Qishen Temple together, and as for the opportunity, it’s every man for himself,” Chishui smiled.

Upon hearing this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. They were afraid of a direct confrontation with the Eternal Tower.

“Fortunately, Brother Chishui spoke for us. Otherwise, Demon Lord Fengyu would not have allowed us to explore the Qishen Temple together,” the people remarked. With their goals achieved, Chishui, as the apparent leader, received numerous compliments.

“Everyone, let’s set off now and enter the Great Desolate Wilderness!” Wanderer Chishui waved his hand, and a massive palace rose from the ground, appearing behind him.

This palace was an ordinary supreme treasure palace, conducive to gathering everyone in one place.

It wasn’t that they didn’t have more powerful palaces, but no one dared to rashly enter someone else’s supreme treasure palace. If they inadvertently triggered the supreme treasure’s power and got suppressed, it would be a big joke.

If they split up, it would seem disorganized. Walker, understanding them best, proactively brought out an ordinary supreme treasure palace. Even a tier 1 Emperor could easily break the palace’s defenses, but it allowed everyone to gather together, appearing as a unified force.

However, this palace also had its drawback—it wasn’t fast enough.

The massive palace could only follow behind the Eternal Tower.

As numerous powerful beings from the Eastern Domain entered the Great Desolate Wilderness together, they felt an overwhelming desolation, even a chill.

The void, purified by the baptism of the Emperor’s Fall, bred countless sprites, forming many unconscious ghosts and monsters. These creatures weren’t very strong, mostly at the Grand Yan Immortal level.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“How many emperors had to die for so many stray thoughts to appear?” Chishui controlled the palace, standing at the highest point, looking at the ghosts and monsters formed by these stray thoughts.

He had survived from the chaotic era until now and had witnessed many grand scenes.

However, just as the Qishen Temple emerged, they had just gathered, not even starting to explore it when a terrifying battle occurred inside. It seemed like quite a few Emperors had died.

If all the Emperors from the Original Universe were to come to this Great Desolate Wilderness, how many of them would die?

“Brother Chishui, just got the news, all the Emperors from the Donglin Realm were wiped out, even the main battle avatar of the Emperor Donglin fell.”

“Oh, and also, Feng MO was severely injured by Yuandun and was killed by a mysterious person.”

“Feng MO?” Chishui recalled this person and said, “l remember this kid had just broken through the tier 4 not long ago and didn’t have an avatar.”

“Yes, this time he truly perished. Because his world was too deeply fused with his Dao, it directly collapsed, and countless lives perished.”

In the pursuit of opportunities, everyone only thought about benefits; no one ever considered what the consequences of failure might be. When the world collapsed, countless tribesmen all perished!

This was the fate of the losers.

Although the opportunity of the Qishen Temple was great, how many could truly succeed in the end?

One person’s success came at the cost of the bones of tens of thousands!

No matter who this phrase was applied to, it was the most accurate, especially for a strong person. The success of a strong person would undoubtedly lead to many failures.

These Emperors, which one of them hadn’t walked out from piles of corpses and seas of blood? They understood this principle better than anyone.

But after tasting the benefits brought by strength, their desire for strength became even stronger. They became the Dao Ancestor’s desire to become a Ruler.

After becoming a Ruler, they would recruit people and build forces everywhere. Forming a group was just an external statement; taking what they needed was the real deal.

Now there was a chance to ascend in one step; how could they not go all out to seize it?

The powerful figures from both sides scanned the Great Desolate Wilderness, their hearts filled with mixed feelings.

After the Emperor’s Fall, Jian Wushuang encountered a big problem on his side.

Although those sprites were only at the Grand Yan Immortal level, there were just too many of them!

Among them, there were many Perfected Grand Yan Immortals.

“Everyone, protect Wushuang and Hu Qing. I have informed Lord Buddha, and there will be Emperors coming to rescue us.”

Jiu Yu was the strongest among them in strength and seniority. He directly ordered everyone to set up a simple formation to resist those ghosts and monsters.

Hehe…

Countless sprites crawled out from the cracks in space. Their bodies twisted, shaped like little ghosts, draped in illusory robes, wandering in the void. Once they encountered cultivators, they surged towards them.

Everyone present at least had the cultivation level of a Nine Revolutions Grand

Yan Immortal, totaling over a thousand people. Half of the elites from the 3,000 Worlds were here. Each of them was stronger than the elders of the Great Si Region, except for Zhen Wuyang.

“Brother Wushuang, follow me!” The woman in grey clothes waved her hand!

They only knew that Jian Wushuang was from the Great Si Region. He had rescued the little monk Hu Qing midway, and the Emperors had ordered them to take care of these two especially, protecting Hu Qing in particular.

However, Hu Qing was a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal but had been saved by Jian Wushuang, a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. This puzzled them, but they didn’t dare to ask. After all, he had saved the people of their 3,000 Worlds.

Jian Wushuang found it somewhat amusing. This woman in grey clothes in front of him was just a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, yet she actively wanted to protect him.

However, he couldn’t refuse other people’s kindness. He nodded and stood behind the woman in grey clothes.

“I’ll have to trouble you later, Friend Luo Shui.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and then stepped back behind Luo Shui.

Luo Shui was an elite from the Donglin Realm and also an elder in the sect. Despite her young age, she had only practiced for 60 million years, which, for many Ninth Transformation Grand Yan Immortals, was merely a simple closed-door cultivation.

Jian Wushuang stood behind a woman, even if other Grand Yan Immortals were polite, some of their actions still showed disdain.

However, he didn’t care about all this. As long as there was a chance, he planned to slip away and leave the Great Desolate Wilderness as soon as possible.

He had a premonition that if he didn’t leave now, he might not be able to leave later.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang carefully examined Fairy Luo Shui in front of him.

From her back, Fairy Luo Shui had a graceful figure. However, her grey linen robe was too loose to discern her shape clearly. Only her white neck and some stray strands of hair that hadn’t been tied up indicated that Luo Shui was undoubtedly a rare beauty..
