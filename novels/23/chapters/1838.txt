Chapter 1839: Soul Burn

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“It’s too late!”

Although it was three simple words, they seemed to have given Fortress Master Hong Tian his death sentence.

“It’s too late?”

Fortress Master Hong Tian lowered his head and he seemed to feel remorseful. However, all of a sudden, Fortress Master Hong Tian’s body expanded fiercely and his body was like a ferocious beast from the past and it dashed out instantly. He then bellowed furiously, “Then you shall die first!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s expression was hideous, like a cornered beast’s.

His hands then unleashed a ray of black light. The ray of black light was ice-cold and it headed toward Jian Wushuang’s head immediately with an infinite amount of coldness.

The speed of the ray of black light was actually faster than the Hong Jun Golden Sword’s extremely fast speed.

“I knew that you would do this,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave.

He knew that an ancient existence and an overlord like the Fortress Master Hong Tian would not beg for forgiveness like an idiot when he was near a situation where he would die.

His begging for forgiveness was simply to create an opportunity to use his own killing move.

However, it was a pity that Jian Wushuang had already taken precautions against that a long time ago.

The instant the ray of black light appeared, Divine Power emerged from Jian Wushuang’s body and he extended his palm.

“Ancient God’s Unique Skill, Eight Divine Mountains!”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Eight lofty golden Divine Mountains landed in front of Jian Wushuang and they acted as layers of defense.

Although the speed of the ray of black light was unbelievable, it was not too powerful in terms of power. Hence, after piercing through six golden Divine Mountains in succession, it stopped at the seventh Divine Mountain.

“It stopped?”

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s eyes turned scarlet in color. When he saw that Emperor God Liu Guang had already taken form in front of him, he turned his body to the back instantly and escaped hastily.

Fortress Master Hong Tian had unleashed a Secret Skill to escape with all his might. As his speed was extremely frightening, he covered millions of miles of distance instantly and appeared before the purple formation.

“Break!”

As Fortress Master Hong Tian looked at the great formation which was formed by the One Realm Pearl, he gave a thunder-like roar and two giant axes swung out.

For the two giant axes, both had the power to split the heavens and earth apart. When they were swung powerfully on the purple energy wall, rumble~~~ The whole formation shook madly. However, it still blocked the attacks of the giant axes in the end.

“What?” Fortress Master Hong Tian’s expression changed.

He was a Peak Emperor God and the attack that he had unleashed was actually unable to destroy the great formation in front of him?

It should be known that the great formation was obviously a treasure that Jian Wushuang had used and it was formed in an instant. As such, logically, it should not be so powerful.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang laughed coldly.

“One Realm Pearl is a treasure that I obtained from the ancient battle and it came from the Ancient Past. Although it is not a Chaos Divine Treasure, its worth and its effects are greater than that of a normal Chaos Divine Treasure. For the great formation that the One Realm Pearl contains, if I were to unleash it with my current Divine Power, although it would be formed instantly, it would be be considered the ravings of a lunatic if it were destroyed by one attack from a Peak Emperor God.”

Jian Wushuang had tested the power of the great formation from the One Realm Palace a long time ago. Even if it were him attacking it with his full power, it would still take him two to three attacks to destroy the great formation.

As for Fortress Master Hong Tian, his abilities were not as strong as Jian Wushuang’s.

“Let’s not give him any chances. Let’s attack together and kill him,” Jian Wushuang said with a heavy voice.

“Leave it to me.”

Emperor God Liu Guang’s eyes turned cold and dense white light gathered in her fair palms.

A frightening aura was also gathering on her hands slowly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank. He knew that Emperor God Liu Guang was unleashing her killing move.

Boom!

The universe shook. After that, three brilliant lustres attacked while illuminating the surroundings.

The three lustres were not obstructed in the slightest and they even ignored the spacetime. In an instant, they appeared in front of Fortress Master Hong Tian.

Fortress Master Hong Tian was like a lion who was extremely furious and he activated his Secret Skill. With that, the two giant axes in his hands expanded and he swung them fiercely.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three loud sounds could be heard. What followed that were the sounds of Fortress Master Hong Tian spitting out blood.

Before Emperor God Liu Guang’s killing move, although Fortress Master Hong Tian was a Peak Emperor God, he was still seriously injured. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Just then, a giant crack appeared at the top of the void abruptly. An infinite amount of purple sacred thunder was also gathering in the crack crazily and it descended slowly with the power to destroy the world.

“Ancient God’s Secret Skill, Thunder Attracting Skill!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with a black jade lustre and more than hundreds of Life Destroying Sacred Thunder that had gathered in the crack fused together instantly to form a giant Life Destroying Thunder Dragon. It then descended while roaring furiously and it covered Fortress Master Hong Tian’s body at once.

As for Emperor God Jiu Yin, he appeared quietly beside Fortress Master Hong Tian like an assassin and a noiseless saber light headed toward Fortress Master Hong Tian’s nape abruptly.

“AHHHHH!!!”

“All of you have forced me to do this!!”

With a loud and furious roar, Fortress Master Hong Tian went insane completely. On his forehead and body, a vein emerged and it was so hideous that it was frightening.

At the same time, the aura on Fortress Master Hong Tian’s body rose again.

Moreover, its speed of rising was extremely frightening!

“This is Soul Burn? Not good!” Emperor God Liu Guang’s expression changed greatly.

Boom!

With a loud sound, a fearsome axe shadow split everything in the universe apart and also split the Life Destroying Thunder Dragon, which had descended from the void above, into two. In addition, the saber light that Emperor God Jiu Yin had unleashed dispersed instantly as well. On top of that, great portions of void burst apart like paper paste.

Amidst this frightening Divine Power storm, a three-meter-tall body which looked like a demon god stepped forward fiercely.

The first person that he appeared in front of was Emperor God Liu Guang.

Swish!

An axe shadow descended.

White lustres then appeared in front of Emperor God Liu Guang immediately and they acted as protective screens. At the same time, she swung her jade hands abruptly and her great amount of Divine Power formed a giant palm print to block the attack from the axe shadow. However, the shocking axe shadow swept past her unreasonably.

The protective screens which were formed by many white lustres were smashed into pieces instantly and the giant palm print which accompanied them also dissipated.

“Hmph!”

With a groan, some blood flowed out from the corners of the Emperor God Liu Guang’s mouth and her body was sent flying.

“Jian Wushuang, I want you dead!”

A hysterical voice reverberated across the universe and the face of the three-meter-tall, demonic, god-like body had already distorted to its maximum. However, one could still tell vaguely that the demonic, god-like body was Fortress Master Hong Tian. However, he had already become crazy like never before.

Boom!

After taking another step, Fortress Master Hong Tian, who had already gone insane, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Swish!

A giant axe shadow descended again.

“Sword Emperor, be careful!” Emperor God Liu Guang warned immediately.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He had not expected that at such a stage, Fortress Master Hong Tian would still able to use some techniques to unleash such fearsome fighting capabilities.

However, fortunately, his reaction was fast and he gathered Divine Power right away. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hands then unleashed a frightening sword essence.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, Fourth Move!”
