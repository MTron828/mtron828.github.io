4165 Dormant

The Divine Lamp of Life Hall was the place where every cultivator of the Divine Life Palace left their life imprint.

As long as a cultivator of the Divine Life Palace died, the Lamp of Life he left in the hall of the divine Lamp of Life would be extinguished.

“Yes.” The Blood Wave Ruler nodded with an unsightly expression. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He had already made up his mind. If Jian Wushuang really died in the Tarot Ruins, then no matter who killed Jian Wushuang, no matter what his background was, he would kill him!

After a while, they arrived at the Life Palace and saw Jian Wushuang’s Lamp of Life.

It was an ancient bronze lamp, and the flame burning on it was much weaker than the other ancient lamps. However, when the Blood Wave Supreme and the Giant Axe Supreme saw this, they both heaved a sigh of relief.

“It’s good. Although Jian Wushuang’s Lamp of Life is weak, it hasn’t been completely extinguished. At least, it means that he’s still alive.” Said Giant Axe Ruler.

The Blood Wave Ruler’s originally gloomy face relaxed upon seeing this. He snorted coldly and said, “It’s a good thing he didn’t die, or else …”

The Blood Wave Ruler paused.

“Alright, alright. Since Jian Wushuang is not dead, we’ll leave everything to him. I believe that he has his own good fortune and there’s no need for us to interfere.” Supreme Giant Axe consoled him with a smile.

The Blood Wave Ruler nodded, and the two of them gradually disappeared from the Temple of the Divine Lamp of Life.

…

Tarot Ruins, second level.

‘Jian Wushuang’ was sitting cross-legged, constantly refining the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass and the middle-grade Dao fruit of laws.

Waves of sword Dao origin and universe law energy wrapped around him like a ball.

At the same time, in the depths of Jian Wushuang’s soul realm, a real consciousness that belonged to Jian Wushuang slowly awakened.

“As expected, the best choice is to go into hiding.”

The consciousness that belonged to Jian Wushuang woke up instantly. Memories flooded into his mind and he understood everything in an instant.

“Eh? The grade of the Wu Qi divine sword has already been raised to the level of a Supreme treasure of principles?” The consciousness body formed by Jian Wushuang’s consciousness squinted. He suppressed the idea of repossessing the body.

He could feel that the person who had taken his body away was actually trying every possible way to improve his body. The level of effort made him feel a little ashamed of his inferiority.

“Since that’s the case, there’s no need to rush.” Jian Wushuang’s consciousness form’s eyes flickered and he instantly made a decision to wait and see.

The sword spirit of the Tarot divine sword contained the remnant will of Tarot Supreme. It had followed Tarot Supreme to the north and south, and had seen many things.

However, although the sword spirit was knowledgeable, Jian Wushuang, who he was facing, was a perfect life form that was rare to see in an era of the universe. The sword spirit knew a little about perfect life forms. For example, he knew that perfect life forms could develop their innate advantages to the extreme and their divine power could be ten thousand times stronger than that of ordinary cultivators.

However, there were some extremely secretive things that the sword spirit did not know.

For example, the unique immortal body possessed by a perfect life form was to completely integrate one’s Soul Origin into divine power. As long as the divine power was not completely destroyed, one would not die.

It was because of this that Jian Wushuang was unrivaled in the soul aspect!

Devil Flame had once tried to possess Jian Wushuang, and his soul power was far stronger than Jian Wushuang’s.

In the end, Devil Flame became Jian Wushuang’s slave.

No one could attack a perfect life form from the soul. The sword spirit performed the same possession technique on Jian Wushuang. It seemed that he had occupied Jian Wushuang’s divine body, Jian Wushuang’s entire body.

In actual fact, Jian Wushuang had intentionally allowed him to control his divine body while his consciousness had already gone dormant.

He had no choice but to do this.

If the Tarot divine sword’s sword spirit knew that possession was useless against him, it might directly absorb all of his divine power and vitality. At that time, he would really die.

Now, the sword spirit of the Tarot divine sword had not only possessed him, but it was also trying to improve his strength after thinking that it had successfully possessed him. Jian Wushuang naturally enjoyed it.

“I’d like to see how much he can improve my strength.” Jian Wushuang’s consciousness form muttered to himself. Then, the consciousness completely merged with his divine power. No matter how brilliant the Tarot divine sword’s sword spirit was, it would definitely not be able to discover the existence of his consciousness.

…

With a single thought, thousands of rivers and mountains could be seen.

With a single thought, the world would change.

The vast universe would never stop moving forward just because someone was missing.

The killing in the universe was constantly happening, and the battle in the Tarot Ruins had never stopped.

In the blink of an eye, a thousand years had passed.

In a crack in the void, on the second level of the Tarot Ruins.

‘Jian Wushuang’ slowly opened his eyes. In his deep, whirlpool-like eyes, there was a ball of coquettish ghost fire jumping.

“Hahahaha, the heavens have blessed me. I didn’t expect this junior’s talent in sword principle to be so high. In just a short thousand years, my comprehension of the sword principle of the universe origin has reached the third realm!” Jian Wushuang stretched out his five fingers, covered his face, and laughed in a low voice.

He was just a sword spirit and did not have any comprehension of sword principle before. However, after controlling Jian Wushuang’s body, he naturally grasped everything Jian Wushuang had comprehended. Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the sword principle of the universe origin had already reached the point of near completion.

In the past one thousand years, thanks to the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass, he had not only reconstructed Supreme Tarot’s Tarot sword principle from his previous life, but he had also pushed it to the third level of sword principle origin!

In addition, the mid-grade nomological Dao fruit was also very useful. It greatly improved his comprehension of the principles of the universe and even benefited him greatly in the principles of the heaven and earth. The eighth law of the heaven and earth had already begun to show signs of fusion.

“It seems like it’s only a matter of time before we return to the peak. This universe is destined to be the era of my Tarot.”

‘Jian Wushuang’ smiled eerily. He had already started to imagine the beautiful blueprint of his future in the universe after he had completely mastered this body and taken in everything it had.

“I think that at that time…it must be very exciting, right?” Jian Wushuang pinched his chin and appeared to be very confident.

With this body, why would he worry about not being able to move unhindered in the universe? Looking down on all four directions?

At that moment, he did not know whether his future would be wonderful or not. However, in the depths of his soul realm, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness body had an extremely wonderful expression.
