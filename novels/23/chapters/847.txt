Chapter 848: Zi Diao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Commander Hong saw the five guards come forward and said with a frown, “This task is not a trivial matter. I don’t want more Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards to sacrifice themselves for it, so the number of people on this mission is limited to four.”

Upon hearing this, some Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards gave an odd expression.

Five guards were willing to accept this mission, but only four of them had an opportunity to perform this task.

“Jiu Zui definitely wants to go. What about the others?”

“Ling Long?”

Commander Hong smiled at a beautiful woman with long aquamarine hair. This woman looked gorgeous and had a perfect figure.

She was Ling Long and she had gained a great reputation among the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards.

“I have been taking Catastrophe Level missions. It’s utterly boring. I have rarely encountered a Hell Level task. How could I miss it?” This glamorous lady laughed with tinkling, bell-like voice.

“Zi Diao, Shui Jin, what about you?” Commander Hong asked.

Zi Diao, looking indifferent, stepped forward and said in a low voice, “Seek fortune in danger. Since this is such a great opportunity, I have to try.”

“Right.” Shui Jin also nodded in agreement.

Commander Hong nodded slightly, and then faced the last of the five.

This man was Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Mountain, will you also take this Hell Level mission?” Commander Hong frowned.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded respectfully but confidently.

“Do you know how dangerous the Hell Level mission is? You have not joined us for long, but you improved greatly. As long as you keep going at this rate, you’ll have a brilliant future. Why do you want to take such a dangerous mission?” Hong Tong asked seriously.

“Commander, it is just like you said, why did I join the Blood Eagle Guard in the first place? Honestly, I should have stayed in the Dragon Guard and keep order in the imperial palace. Wouldn’t it be more comfortable?” Jian Wushuang replied.

Commander Hong was stunned but shrugged his shoulders with resignation. “You’re right. Joining our Blood Eagle Guard means adventure.”

“But now all five of you want to take this hell-level mission, but this task is limited to four people. So one of you has to give it up. What shall we do?”

“Commander, it’s simple.”

The cold and stern Zi Diao suddenly spoke in a resonant, frosty voice. “The Hell Level mission is dangerous. Those who are not strong enough will die, so naturally, the stronger ones would be qualified to go, and the weaker should remain.”

Upon hearing this, the other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards nodded to themselves.

No matter where they were, those who were powerful should be respected.

“Blood Mountain.”

Zi Diao looked over at Jian Wushuang and said in his icy voice, “You’ve just become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. You haven’t encountered any difficult Catastrophe Level missions. Are you qualified to go with us?”

“So… be tactful and stand back. Don’t disgrace yourself.”

Zi Diao’s sonorous words were full of contempt for Jian Wushuang.

Zi Diao was the elder of the Blood Eagle Guard.

He had been in the guard for such a long time, and and the time he spent in the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard was much longer than any of the other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards present.

But his strength was not good and he barely ranked in the middle of them. This really upset him. He was jealous of the other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards who were less experienced than him but stronger.

He was a narrow-minded man.

It was surprising that such a man could be so conceited.

Because of this, he had almost no friends among the Blood Eagle Guards.

But usually, no one dared to offend him at will.

Jian Wushuang had risen so fast. It only took him 15 years to become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. In the guard, this was almost considered legendary.

Zi Diao had also heard of Jian Wushuang’s meteoric rise, so he envied the boy too.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang stayed looking indifferent. He glanced around and found the other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards were staring at him with interest.

The experts should be respected in the Blood Eagle Guard.

Most of the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards had been in the Blood Eagle Guard for a long time and had completed numerous tasks, so they had proved their strength.

Jian Wushuang had just become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, so they were not familiar with him, and only heard that he had been finishing tasks alone like crazy over the past 15 years.

Based solely on this, these three-claw blood eagle guards did yet not truly believe in his strength.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and said unhurriedly, “You’re right, the weak can’t participate in this mission. But, how do you know that I am the weakest one, and not you?”

“Boy, what do you mean?” Zi Diao responded with cold eyes, like a raging lion.

“What do I mean?” Jian Wushuang grinned.

A flicker of killing intents flashed in his eyes. Buzz. An invisible sword shadow materialized in the void, and then slashed at Zi Diao’s head. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This sword shadow moved so fast that an ordinary Eternal Realm expert would have been unable to parry it in time. However, Zi Diao, at the Peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm, reacted with ease. He let out a shout, and the shockwave it dispersed shattered the sword shadow.

“Kid, how dare you!”

Zi Diao’s eyes were blazing with fury with his hair on his body stood up. At the same time, a Purple Thunderbolt Saber appeared in his hand.

Zi Diao held his saber, radiating a mighty aura. Then he stepped forward and appeared in front of his opponent.

Jian Wushuang had already activated the Bloodline Power. In a split second, he had turned into a 15-meter-tall Gold-armored Ancient God.

Fortunately, the scarlet palace was huge enough to hold his body.

His aura burst out as a 12-meter longsword appeared in his hand.
