Chapter 2307 Initial Success in the Sword Doctrine Realm

Whoosh!Lin Yi took a few steps back after the branch collided with him before he steadied himself.

After he regained his balance, he was stunned and speechless.

“I lost!”

Lin Tiefeng, Zhuo Yunfeng, and the other spectators were in disbelief.

An expert in the Peak Chaotic Realm, whose understanding of the Sword Doctrine was in the top thirty within the whole of Anjiu Prefecture, had lost to a kid who was only twelve years old and who used a branch in a duel.

He had lost after one move.

He was completely suppressed and had no way to fight back.

Lin Yi’s thoughts were disrupted. He knew that the sword skill that Jian Wushuang had just cast was indeed Sword Principle Bei Ming.

However, the sword skill that Jian Wushuang had just used contained no essence at all. It was an ordinary, dull strike.

And it was this very ordinary and dull strike that had defeated him.

“How did this happen?” Lin Yi was confused.

Just then, Lin Tiefeng’s face turned serious as he said, “That little one... That sword skill was not ordinary. On the contrary, it was extremely exquisite and skilled!”

“Even though it seems ordinary, it was extremely complex. It’s just that Jian Wushuang cast it in a clean and smooth way!”

“Under normal circumstances, only those have reached a peak in their understanding of this Sword Principle Bei Ming could cast this sword skill in such a simple manner.”

“Reach the peak? But Wushuang only saw Brother Lin Yi demonstrate this sword skill once four years ago. Back then, it also seemed that it was ordinary and simple when Wushuang did the drill. He watched it once and he managed to fully understand this sword skill?” Zhuo Yunfeng was surprised.

“It is highly likely.” Ling Tiefeng nodded his head.

Lin Yi was completely speechless.

It seemed like Jian Wushuang had understood the Sword Principle Bei Ming four years ago and had done the drill perfectly. Because Wushuang’s understanding of this sword skill was far above Lin Yi’s, Lin Yi thought that Jian Wushuang had not understood the essence of this sword skill.

In reality, Wushuang’s talent was far greater than he could ever imagine.

“Brother Zhuo, if I am not wrong, your son has stepped into the Sword Doctrine Realm and is at least at the initial success stage,” Lin Tiefeng said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Initial success in the Sword Doctrine Realm?” Zhuo Yunfeng widened his eyes.

“Husband, Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine is so much deeper as compared to Lin Yi. He is only in the initial success stage of the Sword Doctrine Realm?” Luo Xinqin frowned as she asked.

“What do you think? The initial success in the sword doctrine realm that Brother Lin mentioned is the true Sword Doctrine Realm, it is completely different from the normal Sword Doctrine everyone is talking about. With Brother Lin Yi’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine, and being in the top thirty within the Anjiu Prefecture, he has yet to meet the criteria to break through into the Sword Doctrine Realm,” Zhuo Yunfeng looked over at Zhuo Xinqin and said in a serious tone.

“Even Lin Yi has yet to meet the criteria necessary to enter the Sword Doctrine Realm?” Luo Xinqin was stunned.

She was only in the Chaotic Realm. She was unlike Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng, who understood more about the division of power. Lin Yi, who she thought had a very good understanding of the Sword Doctrine, had yet to even meet the criteria to enter the Sword Doctrine Realm.

“It is not easy to meet the criteria to enter the Sword Doctrine Realm. There are countless experts in the Sword Doctrine within the Anjiu Prefecture. However, the number of these experts who are in the Sword Doctrine Realm is limited, and Lin Yi is not one of them. As for Initial Success in the Sword Doctrine Realm, it requires an even higher level of understanding of the Sword Doctrine compared to just meeting the criteria to enter the Sword Doctrine Realm. As far as I know, there is only one person within the entire Anjiu Prefecture who has reached this level!”

“That man was the previous head of the Zhuge Family, Zhuge Yun! He has decided to shut himself off from the world.”

“Zhuge Yun? Isn’t he a Chaotic Divine Demon? Does this mean that Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine is comparable to a Chaotic Divine Demon’s?” Luo Xinqin was surprised.

“Yes. And most Chaotic Divine Demons who use the sword might not even have as deep of an understanding of the Sword Doctrine as Jian Wushuang!” Lin Tiefeng nodded his head heavily.

Hearing this, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin sucked in a cold breath.

Jian Wushuang had stayed quietly beside them for twelve years. They only found out today that their son’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine was at such a level.

“Unrivalled in the Sword Doctrine. Looks like the name that Taoist Priest Xuan Shen gave Jian Wushuang was correct. Jian Wushuang being at Initial Success in the Sword Doctrine Realm at the age of twelve is really incredible. I have never heard of anyone else who has achieved this,” Lin Tiefeng exclaimed.

“This brat. We cannot let his talent in the Sword Doctrine go to waste. We should send him into those powerful clans where he can develop properly.” Zhuo Yunfeng clenched his fists tightly and thought to himself.

Jian Wushuang walked over with Lin Yi.

Lin Yi was looking at Jian Wushuang as though he was a freak.

“Lin Yan, do not forget our bet,” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Yan and said.

Lin Yan was already speechless.

He had never thought that Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine could be even deeper than that of Lin Yi.

Was he really just a twelve year old child?

Lin Yan trembled slightly as he looked at his dad when he heard what Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha. Don’t worry, little one. The people of the Lin Family keep their words. If it is okay with you, you can even come with me back to the Lin Clan. You can choose and read a wide variety of secret skills and martial art skills within our library.” Lin Teifeng laughed heartily.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Brother Lin, you cannot do that. There are numerous secret skills within your family’s library. Those were obtained through the blood and sweat of your ancestors. How can my son just go in and do what he likes? It is already an honor for him to get the Sword Principle Snow Congelation from you,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Brother Zhuo. We are brothers. Furthermore, Wushuang is incredibly talented. If he is brought up well, he will be very successful in the future. I fear that the library in my house will be too small for my dear nephew,” Lie Tiefeng said.

He was speaking the truth.

Lin Tiefeng was a Chaotic Divine Demon and the head of the Lin Family. He was like an overlord, but after seeing how talented Jian Wushuang was, even he was shocked and in disbelief. He knew that if he told the outside world what he had seen today, everyone would be shocked as well.

Countless clans would fight over this kid who was so incredibly talented in the Sword Doctrine.

The Lin Family was only powerful within the Prefecture. It was impossible for them to guide Jian Wushuang far. All he could do was try his best to help his dear nephew.
