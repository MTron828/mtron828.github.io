Chapter 863: Humanoid Weapons!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Someone here?”

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all looked ahead.

However, they could only see for a hundred meters, and did not see the ‘someone’ that Jian Wushuang was referring to.

“He’s walking toward us.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang looked serious, as he could see with his Scarlet Eye a burly figure slowly approaching the four of them.

In any other place, he would not be so vigilant when encountering somebody.

But this was the Stellar Fog Sea.

To encounter a human being in the Stellar Fog Sea?

Could it be an expert who had entered, but was trapped and could not get out?

This is what they all thought.

Moments later, this burly figure could also be seen by the other three.

The burly figure seemed to be a middle-aged man more than two meters tall. He was extremely sturdy, and carried a wide, thick broadsword. He looked like any other ordinary human warrior.

However, when they really saw this figure clearly, their pupils all constricted in fear.

They actually could not feel the slightest aura from the man.

He had no Spiritual Power aura or life aura. It felt more or less like a Puppet Fighter.

But then again, he was very different from a Puppet Fighter.

“What the hell is he?” Jian Wushuang frowned tightly, keeping alert.

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin stood side by side with Jian Wushuang. They all took out their magic weapons, ready to fight at any time.

At that moment, the burly man suddenly looked up.

As he looked up, he revealed a pair of scarlet expressionless eyes with nothing but endless murderous intent.

“Intruder, kill!”

The burly man uttered two simple words. The next moment, thundering, he charged straight for them.

“Humph.”

Standing beside Jian Wushuang, Jiu Zui grunted. Then a vast Emperor Weapon aura burst out from his black sword as he charged toward the burly man.

“Magic Dragon Kill!”

With Jiu Zui’s deep roar, a mighty power burst out from the black long spear as he slashed with it. This slashing produced strong wind, pushing back the gray fog permeating the air.

The terrifying strong power was enough to astound any expert at peak Step Six.

Although this was not Jiu Zui’s strongest attack, he was still very confident in its power and believed that it would be difficult for a normal cultivator at peak Eternal Realm level to fight against.

The burly man flitted quickly as he pulled out the wide, thick broadsword on his back and slashed directly at Jiu Zui with no finesse.

It was a mediocre slash, but it made a lot of fog around dissipate, and the void burst open abruptly.

Clang!

With a loud clashing sound, two formidable powers collided head-on and the winner emerged in an instant.

“What?”

Jiu Zui let out a muffled groan, blood gushing from the corners of his mouth. He looked up in shock and staggered quickly backward.

“This...”

Jian Wushuang, Ling Long and Shui Jin all stood behind and had not joined the attack. They were astounded at the scene before them.

Jiu Zui ranked first among so many Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards.

Additionally, he was best at attacking. His offensive power was definitely the strongest among the four, except for Jian Wushuang with the strongest Killing Move.

Nevertheless, he was actually repelled by this burly man with only one move.

“Die!”

After Jiu Zui retreated, the burly man did not stop. He immediately appeared in front of the other three and was slashing at them with his wide, thick broadsword.

“So fast.”

Jian Wushuang looked astonished.

This burly figure moved with explosive speed, and it was much faster than Jian Wushuang.

“His offensive power extremely strong, and he is also very quick.” Jian Wushuang tried hard to suppress the terror inside him, and he retreated immediately.

He was still only in a normal human state, and he had not yet become a Gold-armored Ancient God, so he could not fight head-to-head with this burly man.

When he retreated, Ling Long and Shui Jin immediately dashed toward the man.

Shui Jin was extremely confident in his strength, he wielded the saber and went to fight head-on with the burly man.

Two of them broke out their Saber Techniques at the same time.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The blade lights streaked ruthlessly across the Void, splitting it open effortlessly with every slash.

Shui Jin’s Saber Technique was extremely potent while the burly man’s Saber Technique was extremely fierce. Every slash was faster than the previous one.

“Too fast, his sword is too fast.”

Shui Jin was astonished. Fighting with this burly man, he found that his Saber Technique was clearly stronger than his own.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A strange, black shadow rushed forward. The viper-like, black shadow was endless and extremely quick. It was a long whip that Ling Long brandished.

She moved her unusually cunning, fierce long whip, cracking it right in the space between where the burly man and Shui Jin were fighting.

The angle was so cunning that the burly man could not dodge in time.

Crack!

The long whip hit the burly man, making a clear sound. But this whip only stopped him for a second, and the next moment, he was slashing violently again with his wide, thick broadsword.

“It’s impossible.” A sense of shock surged through Ling Long.

Jian Wushuang, a Gold-armored Ancient God, saw clearly from one side what had happened, and he was terrified. “His offensive power is strong enough to repel Jiu Zui in one move, and his speed is so fast that it’s even hard for Shui Jin to withstand. But even his body is that strong?”

Ling Long’s offensive power was not strong enough, but a strike of her whip could cause some harm, even to a peak Step Six expert.

But this burly man continued attacking as if nothing had happened to him.

His attack, speed, and defense were abnormal, and he had almost no weaknesses.

Was he really human?

“What the hell is this guy? Is he a human being, or a weapon?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Blood Mountain, don’t just stand there! Let’s go! You need to create an opportunity. There’s no way my strongest attack can’t kill him.” There was madness in Jiu Zui’s eyes when he went back in. He gave Jian Wushuang a look and immediately rushed to fight.

“Create an opportunity?” Jian Wushuang nodded. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand exploded with horrifying power, and he charged out with his huge body.

The four fought together in fierce battle against the humanoid weapon!
