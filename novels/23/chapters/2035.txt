2036 Life and Death Battle!

The people in Three-Emperors World knew detailed information about the four of them.

Among the four of them, the one that they wanted to kill the most was of course Jian Wushuang.

He was too monstrous, too glaring, too intimidating!

He was already so powerful when he was only in early stage Chaotic Realm. Just how strong would he be when he reached Peak Chaotic Realm? Almost no one could imagine.

That was why Jian Wushuang had to die.

On the other hand, they didn’t care much about the other three.

“Sword Emperor!”

The beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, spoke, “As we are already in this stage, you should reveal your original appearance, right?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned. He then realized that he was still in the form of a brawny man, Ah Shou, who he was disguised as.

His facial muscles quivered and then his figure began to transform too. After a short while, he resumed his original appearance.

The cultivators who rushed back from Doctrine Propagation Palace were shocked.

“I see. This is how he really looks!”

“This person had been in disguise from the very beginning. He hid his power and even his character just to blend in at Imperial Peak.”

“His disguise made him perfect.”

There were countless people who exclaimed in surprise.

They also realized that even though Jian Wushuang had removed his disguise, the aura he carried maintained being in early stage Chaotic Realm.

In other words, Jian Wushuang’s realm was real.

He was really in early stage Chaotic Realm.

“This monster!” Lin Tianhao gasped in admiration. Previously, he had disdained Jian Wushuang, but now…

“This person is actually a super expert in disguise. I once invited him to the battlefield to uphold the reputation of the Lim Family!” The handsome young man next to Lin Tianhao was glad. “Luckily, he didn’t take up the challenge. Otherwise, I’d be doomed.”

Everyone in Imperial Peak was watching the battle.

At the same time, many of them found it saddening because they knew no matter how monstrous Jian Wushuang was, he had come to a dead end.

“Great Emperor Zhi Luo, it is impossible for us to escape from the current situation. We have no choice but to fight a life and death battle,” Jian Wushuang licked his lips and there was madness in his eyes.

“Mm,” there was madness that spread in Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s beautiful eyes. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“You go first,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Huh?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo looked at Jian Wushuang in shock but she saw what Jian Wushuang meant by looking into his eyes.

“I understand,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo nodded heavily. Then, there was a strange power that swept out from the boy at the next moment.

The secret skill of Star Place was instantly performed.

“Come on!!!”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo bellowed and soared. She charged at the thirteen Great Emperors in front of her.

Just as she charged out, Jian Wushuang moved as well.

However, he didn’t charge forward but in the opposite direction from Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

At the end of the direction in which he flew, there was the golden whirlpool, where the Emperor Supreme Rock was.

“Die!”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo was fueled with murderous intention. Her two spears stabbed out madly. With the assistance of the secret skill of Star Palace, her power instantly increased by tenfold and her speed became extremely fast too.

The two spears transformed into bolts of lightning that hit the Great Emperors in front of her.

It was obvious that she wanted to hold all the Great Emperors in front of her back, just like Jian Wushuang, in order to make time for Jian Wushuang.

However, the scene simply looked like she was courting death in Ling Zong’s and other Great Emperor’s eyes.

“Such a joke. Do you think you are like a Sword Emperor who possesses defensive skills that make him almost immortal?” Ling Zong roared and slashed with his battle axe.

The tall, sturdy middle-aged man and the other Great Emperors around him took action simultaneously.

The intimidating attacks surged at Great Emperor Zhi Luo altogether.

Although Great Emperor Zhi Luo performed the secret skill of Star Palace and increased her fighting power by ten times, she still couldn’t be a match to so many Great Emperors.

Under the attacks, Great Emperor Zhi Luo was at a dead end.

But suddenly… Vroom!

There was a sudden burst of boundless soul power. Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s aura had already increased tremendously with the aid of secret skill of Star Palace but it continued to increase at a terrifying speed. Instantly, her aura surpassed everyone else’s at the scene.

Even Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man next to him were obviously weaker than Great Emperor Zhi Luo in terms of aura.

“This is… Soul Ignition?”

“She is really courting death!!”

The Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World came back to reality. Although they had said that Great Emperor Zhi Luo was courting death, their faces grew grave.

When they reached the level of the Great Emperor, it would be easy to suppress or even to injure their opponents. For instance, Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man had strong enough fighting power to injure any ordinary Great Emperor.

It was too difficult to kill a Great Emperor.

A Great Emperor had already reached the top of the universe. It was extremely difficult for one to reach that level and they would have an array of skills.

A Great Emperor would have a final card, which was Soul Ignition!

If a Peak Emperor God were to perform Soul Ignition, his power would increase by a dozen-fold.

As for Great Emperor, although the increment wouldn’t be that ridiculous, his power would absolutely reach a higher level.

However, the price to pay for Soul Ignition was death!

There was no possibility of survival.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo knew that she would die for sure. Hence, she performed Soul Ignition.

Hong!

Great Emperor Zhi Luo exploded with a terrifying fighting power.

Her two spears became even more powerful than before. Then, they became two Death God’s sickles.

The thirteen Great Emperors, only Ling Zong and the middle-aged man could take Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s spears forcefully. Once the others were hit, they would be severely injured even if they didn’t die.

“Be careful!”

The woman was fighting like a cornered beast. There was no point in dealing with her just then.

“Her soul power will burn her to death eventually. We will fight against her then. She’ll die then!”

“Keep her occupied. The others, go after Sword Emperor!”

The thirteen Great Emperors came to a decision very soon. More than half of the Great Emperors stayed back to deal with Great Emperor Zhi Luo, including the tall and sturdy middle-aged man.

The remaining few Great Emperors chased after Jian Wushuang under the lead of Ling Zong.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was stern and he stared at the golden whirlpool at the end of his sight. As for everything that had happened behind him, he knew clearly but he never once turned back to look.

He clearly knew what he was supposed to do then.

Just as he appeared in the golden whirlpool nearby and leaped into the golden whirlpool, there was a sudden bang from the void behind him. At the same time, Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s final shrill scream resounded.

“Sword Emperor, it’s your call!”

Her voice vanished into thin air and her aura was severed entirely.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo had passed away!
