Chapter 1667: Die Together

“Jian Wushuang, I really admire you as you actually dare to chase me into the Dark Region.” Real God Zi Ye’s eyes were crimson in color and he was staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Since you dare to come here, why wouldn’t I dare to do it as well?” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently. He had already turned back to his human form and his additional three heads as well as six arms had disappeared.

“I am different from you. I have already lived for many years. Moreover, I have also stayed as a Chaotic Real God for millions of years. As such, I have lived enough. But what about you? You are a super genius recognized by the Eternal Chaotic World as well as an Inverse Cultivator. Furthermore, it took you quite a bit of effort to finally become what you are now. Therefore, your life is worth more than mine,” Real God Zi Ye’s laughter was filled with madness.

“To be able to drag a top genius like you to death with me, this means that God is still being generous to me.”

“Drag me to death? Real God Zi Ye, aren’t you thinking too highly of yourself?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, “Although the Dark Region is dangerous and it is said that every step is perilous, I am still not very deep in yet. Hence, if I were to go back the way I came from after killing you, I would be able to get out quickly.”

Since Jian Wushuang dared to charge into the Dark Region, he naturally had absolute confidence.

After all, he was not in the deepest part of the Dark Region. Thus, he still had a chance to make the situation improve for the better.

“Haha. You are right. In this situation, it will still not be enough to drag a super genius like you to death with me. However… how about this?” All of a sudden, Real God Zi Ye laughed strangely. Straight away after that, a violent aura burst forth from his body.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed fiercely, “Self-detonation?”

“Haha~~~ Jian Wushuang, don’t you want to kill me? Since that’s the case, let the both of us die together!” Real God Zi Ye’s voice was filled with insanity. His body also expanded crazily and the whole universe entered a state of madness.

“Retreat!” Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang retreated hastily.

“Let’s die!”

Real God Zi Ye gave a shrill cry and his expanded body exploded fiercely.

Rumble~~~ Frightening power swept in all directions, and in the blink of an eye, the whole universe was caught in a storm.

Jian Wushuang was naturally affected by the power wave. However, as Real God Zi Ye had used up his Divine Power and his body was also seriously injured, the power from his self-detonation was not very strong. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was also far away from him and he blocked the power from the explosion easily.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body moved quickly and appeared at the center of the storm. With a wave of his hands, he took the treasures oof Real God Zi Ye, as well as his Qian Kun Ring.

After doing that, Jian Wushuang’s expression became unusually grave.

“I’m in huge trouble!” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Real God Zi Ye’s explosion had indeed not injured him. However, the commotion caused by the self-detonation was extremely shocking.

Moreover, he was in the Dark Region, which was a place where the concentration of Star Demons was the highest. Even though Jian Wushuang did not see any Star Demons while chasing after Real God Zi Ye in the Dark Region, after Real God Zi Ye self-detonated himself, Jian Wushuang saw the dark land below him cracking.

Crack, crack!!!

Cracks appeared on the dark land continuously and within the cracks, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Black, ghost-like shadows came out of the ground and there were so many of them that they were uncountable.

“Star Demons, so many Star Demons!” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave, “These Star Demons had actually been staying underground.”

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power had always been spread out. However, it did not seep deep into the ground of the dark land. As such, he did not realize the existence of the Star Demons previously.

However, at that very moment… as the Star Demons appeared from underground continuously, when Jian Wushuang used his Soul Power to scan the area, he realized that in his vicinity alone, there were more than thousands of Star Demons that had appeared!

There were thousands of Star Demons. Moreover, most of them were matured Star Demons with horns. On top of that, there were also quite a number of Three-Horned Star Demons.

Furthermore, the Star Demons were still coming out from the ground.

“I have to run away quickly!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. When he realized that the Star Demons were coming out of the ground, he unleashed the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood to escape in the direction where he came from.

The Star Demons which were at the bottom naturally noticed Jian Wushuang as well. As such, many Star Demons leaped high up in the sky and chased after Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s speed was extremely fast. Moreover, he had also unleashed thousands upon thousands of shadows. These shadows were moving in all directions crazily and they had also attracted the attention of the Star Demons.

A huge number of Star Demons could be seen throwing themselves onto the shadows.

“It is fortunate that the Star Demons are unable to distinguish me from my shadows. Thus, no matter how many of them there are, there is still hope of me escaping by using my martial art motion.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was grave.

However, all of a sudden… Swoosh! A Three-Horned Star Demon with a body that was obviously larger than the other Star Demons’ appeared ahead of Jian Wushuang. Moreover, the most important thing was that the whole body of the Three-Horned Star Demon was crimson in color.

“Crimson Star Demon?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

A Three-Horned Green Star Demon could already a rival top Chaotic Real God. As for a Three-Horned Crimson Star Demon, it could rival human cultivators in the Real God ranking list.

A Crimson Star Demon had actually appeared in front of Jian Wushuang?

Moreover, the crimson eyes of the Crimson Star Demon had already locked onto him and it was not confused by the shadows.

Whoosh!

A crimson, glittering light moved hastily and appeared directly in front of Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

A sharp claw headed for Jian Wushuang’s throat and its speed was unbelievable.

“Not good!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed quickly. In a flurry, he used his Sword Principles to block the attack.

Clang!

The sharp claw struck the sword blade of the Blood Mountain Sword and an unreasonable amount of power burst forth abruptly. Moreover, the power was treading along the sword blade.

Not only had Jian Wushuang been wearing the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor, his body had also achieved the level of a Chaotic Real God. However, at that very moment, under the impact of the power, snap! Jian Wushuang’s right arm was ripped off completely and the Blood Mountain Sword that he was holding in his hands was sent flying right away.

“Puff!”

Jian Wushuang spit out a mouthful of blood and his body was blasted off like a shooting star. Along the way, he smashed into a number of Star Demons. Among those Star Demons, apart from a Two-Horned Star Demon which had slightly stronger abilities, the other Star Demons were turned into blood mist from the impact.

It was only after a long time that Jian Wushuang regained his posture.

“Run!”

While suppressing the extreme pain in his body and disregarding his right arm, which had been ripped off, as well as his Blood Mountain Sword which was sent flying, Jian Wushuang turned around and escaped quickly.

After all, even if his weapon were lost, he could still think of a way to get it back. However, if his life were lost, everything would be lost.

Moreover, due to the presence of the Crimson Star Demon, Jian Wushuang did not escape according to his original path. Instead, he could only continue to escape deep into the Dark Region. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, a huge number of Star Demons were beside him and in front of him, totally stopping him in his tracks.

Jian Wushuang was caught in a hopeless situation.
