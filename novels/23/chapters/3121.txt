Chapter 3122: Earth-Shattering!

——

The secret skills of the same level were also met head-on. However, because of the seven-star secret skill, Jian Wushuang’s burst of divine power had reached the peak of rank five, completely surpassing the black-haired man.

Therefore, in this collision…Jian Wushuang’s Xi Xiang directly changed the direction of the giant ax in the black-haired man’s hand, and a huge impact forced the black-haired man’s divine body to retreat.

At the moment when the black-haired man was pushed back, Jian Wushuang’s speed had completely burst out.

He directly chased after him and used the Star Dream move.

The divine body of the black-haired man could not withstand Jian Wushuang’s attack at all.

“Chi!”

The Blood Mountain Sword directly passed through the divine body of the black-haired man and cut him in half. His divine body immediately collapsed.

Once his divine body collapsed, the Blood Mountain Sword only eroded part of the black-haired man’s divine body. He was still alive.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang pointed in the direction of the black-haired man.

Space-time divine skill, void annihilation!

Boom!

A terrifying space-time storm suddenly swept out.

This space-time storm was the result of magnifying the destruction of space-time by nearly a hundred times.

The massive space-time storm stunned many experts on the battlefield, scaring many people into retreating.

As for the black-haired muscular man in the space-time storm, his body could not be reassembled at all. His divine power had been completely destroyed by the power of destruction.

A rank five True Saint had died instantly!

“Monster!”

“He could kill a rank five True Saint easily?”

Even evil master and Mirage Water, who knew that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was incredible, were stunned at this moment.

As for Sixth Prince and Green Prince, they were completely dumbfounded.

Especially the Green Prince, he finally understood why these two genius disciples from the Primitive Palace were so respectful of Jian Wushuang.

Why was Sect Master Yingyue of the Holy Feather Sect so polite to Jian Wushuang and even tried to curry favor with him?

In addition, there was the previous attack…

He and Yuan Chong were originally unable to escape from that attack. However, Jian Wushuang had blocked more than 30 experts such as Four God, giving them a chance to escape.

At that time, she and Yuan Chong had believed Jian Wushuang’s words that he was able to block the experts because he had strong life-saving skills and a treasure that could seal time and space for a short time.

But now it seemed that…Jian Wushuang did not need any life-saving skills. With his strength, how could the experts be able to do anything to him?

Moreover, she did not see Four God at all when the Third Prince’s army came. She did not even see any of the nearly 30 experts who came. This was obviously not logical, there was only one reason.

That was that Four God and the others had all been killed!

Thinking of this, Green Prince was even more shocked.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang’s slaughter shocked everyone.

Many people were shocked.

“Who is that man? He is so powerful!”

“A rank three True Saint? How can there be such a terrifying rank three True Saint in this world?!”

“He is too fast and his killing methods are too terrifying. He can kill a rank five True Saint in an instant. If we let him go and slaughter, all of us will die. Quick, find someone to stop him!”

“A peak rank five True Saint. If we want to stop him, at least an expert at the peak of rank five will have to do it himself!”

Many shocked and angry voices echoed throughout the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang’s killing was too terrifying.

Especially when he killed a rank five True Saint in an instant, the other rank five True Saints in the Third Prince’s camp were terrified and did not dare to fight with Jian Wushuang.

On the battlefield, only a rank five Peak True Saint was qualified to stop Jian Wushuang. However, there were only two rank five Peak True Saints in the Third Prince’s camp. One of them was fighting with Xing Gang, the commander of the Purple Blood Camp, the other one was also entangled by Xin Zong of the Holy Feather Sect, so there was no extra rank five Peak True Saint to spare.

Without a rank five Peak True Saint to fight personally, ordinary rank five True Saints would not dare to fight with Jian Wushuang, even if there were two or three of them.

“Damn it, how could Sixth Brother have such a terrifying genius?”

The Third Prince stood in the void with a cold expression and a gloomy aura.

The situation on the battlefield had been completely under his control because of the spies he had planted. However, because of Jian Wushuang’s appearance, the situation on the battlefield had been reversed again. The problem now was…if no one could stop Jian Wushuang, with his terrifying killing speed, it would not take long for him to kill all the experts under him.

“This person is indeed very powerful.”

An indifferent voice sounded. The person who spoke was naturally Chu Yixiao.

Chu Yixiao was a disciple of the Purple Cloud Pavilion and was a genius himself. He had a certain level of confidence in his talent.

However, when he saw Jian Wushuang, he was not happy.

They were both geniuses, but the gap between their talents was too great.

Jian Wushuang was a rank three True Saint, but he could easily kill a rank five True Saint. His talent was incredible.

“In terms of talent and ability, no one I’ve met can match him. However, his talent doesn’t mean that he will reach the peak in the future. After all, the Divine Beginning World is very dangerous. No matter how brilliant a genius is, he will die if he is not careful. Once he dies, there will be no difference between a genius and a loser,” Chu Yixiao sneered, a strange light flashed in his eyes.

“Brother Yixiao, let’s not talk about this now. We have to think of a way to stop him. Otherwise, we’ll lose this battle,” the Third Prince said anxiously.

“Don’t worry. Since I’ve agreed to help you, I won’t let anyone get in the way. At the very least, this rank three True Saint won’t cause any trouble,” Chu Yixiao said with a smile.

“Brother Yixiao, what do you mean?” The Third Prince immediately looked at Chu Yixiao.

“Hehe, such a dazzling genius. Even I can’t help but want to fight him head-on.” Chu Yixiao laughed heartily. At the same time that he laughed…a majestic divine power aura suddenly rose from his body.

This Chu Yixiao had once cultivated a technique to conceal his aura, so until now, no one had been able to see his specific level, and no one had paid attention to him.

But now that he had taken the initiative to release his divine power aura, the people on the battlefield could see that Chu Yixiao was also a genuine rank five True Saint! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even though his aura indicated that he had just become a rank five True Saint, don’t forget that he was a genius disciple of the Purple Cloud Pavilion!
