Chapter 2795: World of Sword Principle

The sword essence in the huge sword tomb soared to the sky.

Jian wushuang was at the core of the sword tomb, like the Master of Sword Principle.

In a short moment, the world of Sword Principle and the world of treasures had been formed!

“This, this is...”

“The transformation of Heaven and earth?”

“I feel like I’m in another world. The sword essence in this world is too strong.”

“Change the world? What kind of technique is this?”

The experts on the battlefield instantly understood their situation. They also understood that the world they were in had already changed. They were all extremely shocked.

Even Palace Master Nan Wu looked at Jian wushuang with great shock and shock.

“Change the world. What a great treasure.”There was even a trace of heat in the deepest part of palace master Nan Wu’s eyes. “However, even if you use that treasure and change the surrounding environment, what can you do? Can you do anything to me?”

Although he was surprised by Jian Wushuang’s skill, palace master Nan Wu did not care.

After all, he had absolute strength as a support, so he was absolutely confident.

“I’ll let you know.”

Jian wushuang just smiled slightly and slowly raised his hand.

“Condense!”

With a light smile, a majestic sword essence immediately condensed in the void in front of Jian wushuang.

With the help of the world of sword principle, the sword essence became solid.

Buzz, Buzz, a large amount of reincarnation power spread out.

In the Void, the powerful reincarnation sword formation appeared again.

This time, Jian Wushuang did not use a magic weapon. He just relied on the sword essence to condense the reincarnation sword formation. Even so, the power was still amazing. After the sword formation was completely formed, Jian wushuang pointed out with one hand, the Samsara Sword Formation once again shot toward Palace Master Nan Wu.

Palace Master Nan Wu stood there with a cold expression. A faint black thunderbolt power gathered on his right palm.

He immediately struck out with his palm.

The powerful palm, which contained a powerful destructive power, collided with the Samsara Sword Formation.

The Samsara sword formation directly collapsed and dissipated into nothingness. However, Palace Master Nan Wu also took a step back.

“Just by relying on the sword intent, this sword formation isn’t weaker than when he used the divine weapon?”Palace master Nan Wu frowned.

However, at this moment, beside Palace Master Nan Wu, Buzz Buzz Buzz! ! !

A shocking sword intent swept out. This sword intent was extremely huge and condensed at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, a huge phantom of an emperor appeared in the void on the left and right sides of the Golden Southern Palace. These two phantom emperors held the emperor’s sword in their hands, it contained a powerful Emperor’s aura.

Without any fancy moves, the two phantom emperors slashed the emperor’s sword directly at Palace Master Nanwu.

The ice-cold sword edge swept across all directions.

“What is this?”Palace master Nanwu’s face darkened.

He could see that the two phantom emperors were formed purely by sword essence. The key was that the sword essence contained in the two phantom emperors was too vast and huge. Therefore, the sword skill that the Phantom Emperors slashed out.., even he did not dare to underestimate them.

“The Thousand Treasures great world is one of the secret skills of the Mountain River Map. This move is very useful. It is not only to change the surrounding environment and the heaven and earth, so that the heaven and earth environment has a great advantage over one’s own strength.”Jian wushuang smiled faintly.

It had been a while since he had obtained the mountain river map in this life. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the beginning, his comprehension of the thousand treasures great world was indeed very crude. He could only barely construct a heaven and earth environment that was suitable for him to fight in.

But now, as his strength continued to increase, his comprehension of the laws also continued to increase. His control of the Thousand Treasures great world also became stronger and stronger.

He could use many of the techniques in the thousand treasures great world.

For example, in the world of Sword Dao, he could use the sword intent in the world of Sword Dao to condense everything in the world.

He could condense a divine weapon, condense an Emperor’s shadow, and fight with his opponent. Furthermore, this world of Sword Dao had greatly increased his strength in Sword Dao. It could be said that in this world of Sword Dao, he was the ruler.

Facing the two emperor’s swords that were slashing at him from the left and right, palace master Nan Wu first retreated. Then, a large amount of black lightning surged out. These Black Lightning instantly condensed into two Black Lightning Dragons in the void, they roared as they met the two emperor’s swords head-on.

Hua La La ~ ~ ~

The two emperor’s swords were completely shattered. Even the two Emperor’s shadows that appeared beside Palace Master Nan Wu were destroyed by the Black Lightning Dragons.

“Sword one, is that all you can do?”Palace Master Nan Wu was calm, and there was a hint of contempt on the corner of her mouth.

“Hehe, don’t worry. My World of sword principle is not as simple as what you see now.”Jian wushuang smiled faintly, but he clenched his right hand tightly. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand seemed to have sensed the battle intent rising from the bottom of his heart, the body of the sword also began to tremble crazily.

Rumble..

The pressure of the four realms was still pressing crazily.

With the help of the world of sword principle, the perfect sword world that Jian wushuang created within a range of 100,000 kilometers had a great deterrent effect.

Even Palace Master Nan Wu was shocked at this moment.

“This kid’s sword world is really strong,”palace master Nan Wu muttered.

But at this moment, Jian Wushuang had already moved.

Whoosh!

Under the effect of the space-time rule, Jian Wushuang was extremely fast. He appeared in front of Palace Master Nan Wu in an instant.

Then, Jian Wushuang attacked.

The beautiful sword light lit up, so beautiful that it could break one’s heart.

The sword light was hazy with a hint of intoxication, which made people yearn for it.

It was the seventh move of space-time swordsmanship, intoxication one move!

The same intoxication one move was also used with all one’s strength. However, it was completely different when it was used in the ordinary world and now in the Sword Principle World.

In terms of speed, it was much faster.

In terms of power, it was also much stronger.

Even the essence contained in the sword was deeper.

However, in the face of this sword, Palace Master Nan Wu just smiled faintly and casually struck out with one palm.

The void shook!

Bang!

Palace Master Nan Wu’s palm, which was filled with black thunderbolt power, directly struck the body of the Blood Mountain Sword. The Blood Mountain sword slightly changed its direction and the Sword Force instantly disintegrated. However, Jian Wushuang did not retreat at all. He waved his wrist, he actually continued to attack.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Sword lights swept out one after another.

Jian wushuang displayed his swordsmanship to the fullest with his close combat ability.

“You want to fight me in close combat? How dare you!”Palace Master Nan Wu shouted, and then he also attacked.
