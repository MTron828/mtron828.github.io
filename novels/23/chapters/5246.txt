5247 A Suitable Treasure

With the blessing of the Beast God's Eye, one could achieve a status comparable to that of Special Life Forms.

Qiuhuang seemed to perceive his confusion and spoke in an instructive tone, "Young one, don't be unconvinced. I know you possess a special treasure that can enhance your divine body. However, don't forget, you're only at the Nine Revolutions stage. When you reach the Perfected Nine Revolutions or even attain the Ultimate Dao, the effectiveness of that treasure will diminish significantly."

"The most crucial aspect of the divine body is its foundation. The stronger your foundation, the more resilient your divine body will become. In our era, the requirements for the divine body were much higher compared to your current standards."

Qiuhuang reminisced about ancient times, his tone becoming nostalgic and wistful. "In the Ancient Era, your strength could be considered above average but far from peerless. Only the origin source Dao could barely be called a peerless genius; others were far behind, at least in the present age."

His words were not exaggerated; the glory of ancient times was indeed a grand era.

Back then, there were still overlords in the starry sky, but now, the heavens were desolate.

There were hardly any Universe Masters, especially in the River of Time where the Original Universe was located; even the mighty were nearing desolation.

Jian Wushuang, hearing that there were geniuses in the present age surpassing the prodigies of today, grew grave. Wasn't the strongest among the Grand Yan Immortals a half-step Emperor?

After breaking through the Nine Revolutions, he could leap to a level comparable to an Emperor. Wasn't that already considered peerless?

"Elder, are there other Grand Yan Immortals on other Original Planets who are even more extraordinary?" Jian Wushuang inquired.

"Yes, on your Original Planet alone, there are three top-tier trial takers who are no less than you. You should be aware, their opportunities were also incredibly exceptional, especially that little monk. Judging by the karma on your body, you should know him," Qiuhuang said slowly.

Little monk?.bender

He's talking about Hu Qing!

Jian Wushuang nodded. Hu Qing's opportunity was indeed extraordinary. The Qishen Temple took special care of him, making him unique in the entire Grand Yan Immortal in the Original Universe.

"His opportunity is extraordinary. At least I can't see where his inheritance comes from. Perhaps some big shot recognized his potential and granted it to him in advance."

Big shot?

Jian Wushuang was shocked. Could it be that in this Qishen Temple...

"Kid, don't overthink it. This Qishen Temple is more powerful than you can imagine," Qiuhuang said proudly.

"Haha, that's a bit exaggerated. Why don't you talk about yourself? The little monk's inheritance is powerful, and his path is more or less predetermined. You are different from him. At least you haven't cultivated any inheritance. What you need most now is to solidify your foundation, prepare for future inheritances, and then merge with the Dao."

Saying this, Qiuhuang couldn't help mentioning Ji Chaoyang, making Jian Wushuang aware of the strong path the other party had taken, which was the most in line with the Qishen Temple's plan for the Grand Yan Immortal.

Wan Xing had the potential to become an Emperor. He gained the power of a half-step Emperor only after practicing powerful supreme techniques, but in Qiuhuang's eyes, he was not worth mentioning.

So, in this Original Planet, he could only rank third.

He was not even on par with Ji Chaoyang.

Although Qiuhuang said so, whether Jian Wushuang believed it or not was up to him. However, he really did not care. He would rely on the Extreme Dao's 'Unity of All Things' origin source, which was countless times more powerful than the Ultimate Dao.

Wait and see, someday I will surpass everyone...

The seeds of strength had long been sown within him. Jian Wushuang's determination was unshakeable. No one could stand in his way. Once a Dao Lord was formidable to him, but now, he didn't even bat an eyelid.

Even half-step Emperor was within his grasp.

Qiuhuang didn't say much, directly presenting several treasures for Jian Wushuang to choose from.

"These treasures are worth 100,000 treasure points, all of them are best suited for you," Qiuhuang said, introducing each one.

"There are three categories," he continued.

"Treasures that enhance the soul. These are what you need the most right now. The stronger your soul realm, the faster you can advance to Perfected Nine Revolutions. This Dark World Divine Stone is perfect for you. Its soul power is abundant, just one can significantly strengthen your soul. You can only absorb one in your lifetime. 50,000 treasure points, definitely worth it."

Jian Wushuang's heart stirred. What Qiuhuang said was indeed true. Breaking through the Nine Revolutions was much more beneficial for him than advancing in the Ultimate Sword Dao. It was exactly what he needed most at the moment.

"Alright, I'll exchange for this Dark World Divine Stone." Jian Wushuang took out his token and handed it to Qiuhuang.

Taking the token, Qiuhuang glanced at the treasure points on it and nodded with a smile, "You have so much."

"The second one is divine body enhancements. Here are treasures worth 30,000 treasure points each, specifically for improving your divine body. They can boost your divine body to 1,800-fold its base power."

Jian Wushuang felt a thrill. Improving his soul realm wouldn't translate into immediate combat power. However, enhancing his divine body was a direct boost in his battle capabilities.

With a base divine body power of 1,800 times, combined with the Beast God's Eye, he would be close to 8,000 times his base power. The stronger the divine body, the lower the multiplier. To break through a thousandfold increase, the base divine body would likely need to be 5,000 times stronger.

As he progressed, enhancing his divine body became increasingly difficult and costly. Jian Wushuang felt immense pressure. He had already spent 80,000 out of the 110,000 treasure points, and his strength had only increased by this much.

"The third type concerns your original source Dao. Since you are determined to enhance it, I recommend this Source Fruit. It's much stronger than Enlightenment Flowers and more natural. It can instantly boost your original source Dao. Price-wise, it's also 30,000 treasure points."

A total of 110,000 treasure points, not a single point left. Jian Wushuang felt like his heart was bleeding, but what Qiuhuang said was true. These treasures were exactly what he needed. He gritted his teeth and exchanged for all of them.

"Here, they are all yours now. These are instant-boost treasures; you don't need to spend treasure points on time in the secret chambers."

Jian Wushuang remained silent. How many treasure points had he spent in the secret chamber? Now, with a wave of his hand, he had spent a total of 110,000 treasure points with Qiuhuang.

There probably weren't many people in the entire Original Universe who were as extravagant as him.

"By the way, I've noticed your interest in space. I happen to have a one-of-a-kind spatial treasure here. It requires 500,000 treasure points. If you want it, you'll have to work twice as hard," Qiuhuang said, suddenly producing a pale blue crystal in his hand, radiating an endless aura of space.

Feeling the power emanating from it, Jian Wushuang's mind stirred. Immediately, he felt that all the treasures in his hands were useless. None of them, combined, could match the value of that square- shaped crystal.

His greatest reliance was the immense utility of the 'One Thought Universe' spatial origin source to him.REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

Among the Grand Yan Immortals, there were only a few who could touch the threshold of the origin source of space. He couldn't even devour it if he wanted to.

Only during the Emperor's Fall in the Great Desolate Wilderness did he manage to devour a considerable amount of spatial origin source, allowing his One Thought Universe to cover a range of millions of miles.
