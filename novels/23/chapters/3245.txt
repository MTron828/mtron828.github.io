“Hey, did you guys see what happened just now?” A skinny elder with black hair asked in astonishment.

“Of course we saw it,” a purple-robed woman said in shock, “He single-handedly forced the ten experts of the Flame Saint Realm to flee in all directions. This Heavenly Sword Marquis...is really something!”

“He is indeed powerful, especially with his assassination methods. Without an expert who specializes in the soul present, Heavenly Sword Marquis could kill the experts of the Flame Saint Realm one by one without any scruples. The people of the Flame Saint Realm reacted quickly and knew that they had to flee in all directions. If they didn’t flee, several more people would definitely die.”

“This is the Flame Sanctum. Gu Zhenzi, Kong, which one of them isn’t a famous expert? With their lineup, they could do whatever they wanted in the Blood Wave Realm. But in the end, they were forced to such a state by Heavenly Sword Marquis alone. Tsk tsk...”

“And it seems that the Heavenly Sword Marquis hasn’t given up yet. He’s still chasing after the people of the Flame Saint Realm. I wonder if the person he’s targeting will be able to survive from his hands.”

The experts who saw the scene just now were all sighing.

...

In the vast void, a figure was flying forward at high speed. While flying, he kept turning his head to look behind him, but he did not see a single person.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis must have gone to kill others,” the long-haired man with a hooked nose muttered to himself.

He thought so not because he did not see Jian Wushuang, but mainly because he was confident in his own strength.

Among the six people in the Flame Saint Realm, Gu Zhenzi and Kong could easily face Jian Wushuang. Besides them, there were two other Invincible Saints, including this man with a hooked nose.

As an Invincible Saint, he had a good life-saving ability. He believed that Heavenly Sword Marquis should not be so stupid as to target him.

After all, he was not so easy to kill.

However, the hawk-nosed man did not know that Jian Wushuang was following him closely not far behind him.

That was right. When the six people of the Flame Saint Realm were fleeing in different directions, the hawk-nosed man was Jian Wushuang’s first target.

He wanted to kill the Invincible Saint!

“Lan Ying, one of the Invincible Saints of the Flame Saint Realm, is very powerful. During the battle for the second Blood Wave Token a few days ago, he fought with an expert who ranked lower on the True Saint List. Although he was suppressed, he could not defeat him in a short time!”

“In terms of strength, although Lan Ying is not as strong as the expert on the True Saint List, he is still a very powerful existence among the Invincible Saints. Moreover, he has both offense and defense. His attack power is very strong, and his body protection ability is also very good. However, his weakness is also very obvious. He is not good at speed.” Jian Wushuang knew the information about Lan Ying like the back of his hand, at this moment, he could not help but smile.

Gu Zhenzi, Kong, and Lan Ying did not expect that he would target Jian Wushuang, because Lan Ying was very strong and difficult to deal with. However, Jian Wushuang had to do the opposite.

“He is strong, but his speed is too slow. If I want to assassinate him, he will be treated as a living target.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold, and he immediately approached Lan Ying.

Lan Ying seemed to be completely sure that Jian Wushuang would not find him, so he stopped and did not move forward.

However, at the moment when Lan Ying relaxed, Jian Wushuang had already made his move.

He quietly appeared behind Lan Ying. Without the latter noticing, Jian Wushuang had already made his move.

“I wonder who the Heavenly Sword Marquis is targeting. I hope Gu Zhenzi and senior brother Kong can stop him. We’ve already lost two people in this encounter with the Heavenly Sword Marquis. If he kills another one, the losses will be too great.” Lan Ying sighed softly, however, the blood-red sword light behind him was less than a meter away from him.

At this moment, Lan Ying suddenly woke up.

“This killing intent is from Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Lan Ying reacted, but he did not even have time to turn around, let alone block Jian Wushuang’s sword. He could only let the blood-red sword light stab at his divine body, however, just as the blood-red sword light was about to touch his divine body, a layer of blue crystal immediately appeared on the surface of his body.

The blue crystal instantly covered his entire body. When the blood-red sword light pierced the blue crystal, a terrifying power suddenly erupted. The shocking power contained in the sword immediately penetrated the blue crystal, however, the sword light was immediately blocked by the protective armor that Lan Ying was wearing.

Whoosh!

The power of the sword light was completely exhausted, but it did not penetrate the protective armor. It only left a clear white mark on the armor.

At this moment, Lan Ying suddenly turned around and stared at Jian Wushuang with his eyes that seemed to spew flames.

“How dare you chase after me? How dare you!”

Lan Ying’s shocked and angry voice resounded in the sky. A blood-red long stick rushed toward Jian Wushuang in an instant. Jian Wushuang frowned and immediately retreated. In the next moment, he disappeared in front of Lan Ying again.

“Humph, coward!” Lan Ying cursed.

Jian Wushuang, who had hidden in the surrounding void, looked at the white mark on Lan Ying’s protective armor and sensed the divine power aura on Lan Ying’s body. His eyes narrowed.

“Lan Ying is really like the information. He is both offensive and defensive. Not only is his attack powerful, but his protective ability is also very strong. I just used the first move of blood drop to pierce his divine body without any hindrance, but it still failed to pierce through his protective armor, so I can’t seriously injure him at the first moment.” Jian Wushuang was also a little surprised.

Although he did not injure Lan Ying immediately, judging from the latter’s divine power aura, it seemed that Lan Ying had used up some of his divine power.

Obviously, although the attack did not pierce through the armor, the terrifying power contained in the sword still penetrated through the protective armor and entered Lan Ying’s body. It caused some damage to his divine body and also caused Lan Ying to use up some of his divine power.

Although it did not consume much divine power, which was estimated to be only one-fortieth of his entire divine power, it still gave Jian Wushuang hope of killing Lan Ying.

“I deliberately followed Lan Ying for a period of time and waited until I was far away from the battlefield. Now, Lan Ying is a certain distance away from Gu Zhenzi and the empty place. It will take them some time to get here. During this time, I must kill Lan Ying!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes revealed a shocking killing intent, in the next moment, endless power of ice and fire swept out.
