“The first Tian Ling Crystal!”

Jian Wushuang looked at the emerald crystal in his hand and revealed a smile.

“Jian Wushuang, a Tian Ling Crystal is a really good treasure. It is definitely helpful to improve your Soul Power. If it’s possible, try to get more,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang, quick, save me!”

Jian Wushuang received an extremely urgent SOS message and his face grew grave.

“It’s Huo Yi. He’s asking for help?” Jian Wushuang looked towards where Huo Yi was, “Hurry up!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang came to the rescue straightaway.

He immediately sent a message to Feng Tao on his way there but Feng Tao didn’t reply.

“What’s going on? Feng Tao didn’t reply at all?”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. However, due to the urgency, he didn’t have enough time to think much. He could only rush over with his fastest speed to where Huo Yi was.

Huo Yi’s location wasn’t far from him. With his travel speed, he managed to reach him in a few breaths.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure was stopped on the tree crown but his gaze grew cold.

“Huo Yi, what are you doing?”

Jian Wushuang looked forward, right at Huo Yi who stood on the ground.

When Huo Yi saw Jian Wushuang’s arrival, he put his hands behind him and stood there in silence with a malicious smile plastered on his face.

He didn’t even look in a fix, let alone in life danger.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t blame me. Whatever that Master Bei Xiu is offering is too tempting, I can’t reject him,” Huo Yi smiled.

“Master Bei Xiu?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Hehe, Jian Wushuang, at last, we meet again,” A vicious laugh was heard, then a figure slowly appeared before the thick forest. It was no other than Bei Xiu.

The very moment Bei Xiu appeared, another two figures came from nowhere. They blocked Jian Wushuang’s way and Jian Wushuang could tell that they were both Peak three-starred Soul Masters from their arm-band.

Even if Jian Wushuang was distracted, he immediately came back to reality with the sight before him.

“I’m trapped!”

“It is a lie that he has trouble in cultivation. It is also a lie that he needs Desolate Crystals. His goal is to lead me to the deserted region and create an opportunity for Bei Xiu!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold.

“Jian Wushuang, I guess not everyone is like you and can resist the temptation of Feng Ling Knack,” Bei Xiu smiled viciously. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He had used Feng Ling Knack to buy Huo Yi over. Hence the scene before his eyes.

“How about Feng Tao?” Jian Wushuang stared at Huo Yi.

“Don’t worry. He naturally has someone to take care of him,” Huo Yi smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, instead of worrying about the other person, why not be worried for yourself?” Bei Xiu sneered, “Previously, on Soul Island, I really couldn’t do anything to you. But then, in this deserted region… Hehe, the deserted region is so dangerous. It is normal that a person or two die here.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and laughed, “Aren’t you scared that you couldn’t get the manipulation method from me if you killed me?”

“Of course I’m worried. So, I don’t intend to kill you. I only want to catch you alive. Only if I catch you alive will I be able to get whatever I want from your head,” Bei Xiu smiled but didn’t bother talking to Jian Wushuang further.

“Come on then.”

Vroom! Vroom!

Two fierce consciousnesses exploded straightway.

The two Peak three-starred Soul Masters that Bei Xiu hired had murderous intentions surging in their eyes. Then, two giants formed by consciousness entirely appeared. The moment the giants appeared, they were covered in armor, boots and helmets. One of their hands held a sword and the other held a shield. Boundless auras were emanating from the two giants.

“The way they used their consciousnesses is exactly the same?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

Suddenly, the two giants that were giving out a soaring aura charged. Their speeds were as swift as lightning. Suddenly, they appeared before Jian Wushuang and the swords that they were holding descended one after another.

Rumble!

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power suddenly surged and it formed into a huge dark tortoise covering his body.

Bang! Bang!

The two giants’ swords hit the black tortoise and the brightness on the shell grew dim. The black tortoise shook crazily, as though it was going to collapse at any time. But in the end, it resisted the attack.

“Humph!”

One of the Peak three-starred Soul Masters had deep ripples in his eyes and there was suddenly an amazingly huge consciousness giant behind him. The giant was also wearing armor but he wasn’t holding sword and shield but a huge bow.

Then, the huge giant was already pulling on the bow. Buzz. Boundless power concentrated in the bowstring.

Swoosh!

A ray of flowing light suddenly exploded.

The ray of flowing light went through the void and appeared before Jian Wushuang. It hit the tortoise shell directly.

Psst psst psst!!!

The terrifying penetration power spread. At the same time, the two giants in armor wielded their swords and stroked. Jian Wushuang felt pressured.

Ching ching!

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted at the sound. The black tortoise covering his body was finally unable to withstand the consciousness giant’s attack and shattered. The forceful power shook Jian Wushuang and he was in a bind.

Swoosh!

There was another ray of flowing light again. The consciousness giant pulled his bow and shot another arrow.

There was a glimpse of a glare in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and a fierce Soul Power erupted.

“Inextinguishable Light!”

Jian Wushuang performed the secret skill of Tian Yuan!

The secret skill of Tian Yuan was different from Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. The latter was merely a manipulation method of Soul Power. It was just a foundation.

But the secret skill of Tian Yuan was the real secret skill of Soul Attack. It was definitely only focusing on Soul Constrain!

Even the current him would find it easy to perform the technique. During his years in Soul Island, although he fought ferociously with many Soul Masters, he never once performed the technique. Until just then when he had put it to play directly.

A bunch of lights condensed from Soul Power and shot out quietly.

It seemed quiet and inconspicuous, but when the bunch of lights collided with the arrow that the consciousness giant shot…

Psst psst!

It was as easy as breaking dead wood. The flowing light that was transformed from the arrow that the consciousness giant shot suddenly collapsed. The silent attack hit one of the Peak three-starred Soul Master opposites without lessening the force.
