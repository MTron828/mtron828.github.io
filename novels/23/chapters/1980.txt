Jian Wushuang delivered an impassioned speech and spoke with confidence

He spoke with confidence because justice was on his side. There was a drastic change on the ancient battlefield and Green Fire World had such great value, it was all the work of the grand formation.

Plus, the grand formation did stabilize the spacetime storm.

If there wasn’t the grand formation, everything would just be empty talk.

However, he didn’t share one thing. The grand formation wasn’t maintained by the energy provided by various resources and treasure. It had merged into one with the spacetime storm. Hence, the energy source to maintain the formation was actually with the spacetime storm.

It was also the brilliant skill of the person who had created this formation, Jian Wushuang’s master, Xuan Yi. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Over the years, Green Fire World had been manipulating the formation. In actual fact, they didn’t need to spend any resources to manipulate the formation.

He had said it required an enormous resource to maintain because he wanted to get more benefits for Green Fire World from the experts before him.

Plus, whatever he said, the experts in front of him had to agree.

As expected, East Royal Emperor from Sanctuary Alliance. who had studied intensively in formations spoke, “To maintain such a huge formation, the required resources are beyond one’s imagination. Even to Sanctuary Alliance, it wouldn’t be easy. Green Fire World would require a decent amount of resources and treasure to maintain the formation. It is pretty reasonable.”

Although the other experts were unwilling, they had no choice but to agree.

“Sword Emperor, tell us, how many Doctrine Gems?” Ancestor Tian Chen asked.

“Not many. Any Almighty who enters the ancient battlefield once will need to pay two thousand Doctrine Gems as payment,” Jian Wushuang said. “Pay attention. I meant per entry. In other words, regardless of how long you stay, tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, as long as you don’t leave, you only have to pay two thousand Doctrine Gems. However, if you only stay on the ancient battlefield for a few hundred years or even a dozen years and you leave in between, you will still have to pay two thousand Doctrine Gems when you enter again.”

“I will allocate an expert to collect Doctrine Gems at the space gap that is connected to the ancient battlefield.

The experts at the scene exchanged a look and nodded in silence.

Only two thousand Doctrine Gems, any top Chaotic Real God who was rich could easily pay. To Almighties, it was nothing. So, they could easily accept it.

However, it was nothing if there was only one person paying two thousand Doctrine Gems. However, the Almighties from Eternal Chaotic World who could wander in this ancient battlefield numbered more than a thousand, and every one of them would pay two thousand Doctrine Gem each, it would be a sky-high number if all added up. Plus, if they were to leave in between, they would have to pay Doctrine Gems again when they re-entered the ancient battlefield.

To Green Fire World, it was simply a huge income.

“Sword Emperor, we agree with your three conditions,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Don’t be in a hurry. I have a fourth condition,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“More?” Ancestor Tian Chen creased his eyebrows, “Sword Emperor, don’t you have too many conditions?

“Don’t worry. The fourth condition has nothing to do with anyone’s benefit. It is merely a personal matter,” Jian Wushuang spoke but his gaze turned cold, “I, Green Fire World, was obviously framed. We were nearly exterminated because of this. I naturally have to deal with this. Hence, my fourth condition is to wish for everyone to tell me, who is it that exposed the existence of the ancient battlefield and then pushed Green Fire World to the toughest point?”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, with a tinge of murderous intention.

The experts on the spot let out a breath of relief.

They thought Jian Wushuang was going to bring up some strict conditions but he was merely looking for the person who had exposed the secret of the ancient battlefield. It had nothing to do with them, so they naturally didn’t mind.

“I know that person,” there was a cold voice.

Everyone looked to the source of the voice. The person who spoke was Colored Glaze Great Emperor.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised at that.

Colored Glaze Emperor was the first to reach Green Fire World among all Great Emperors. Plus, when she reached Green Fire World, she called out his name straightaway. She obviously already knew the actual situation in Green Fire World and someone had definitely told her.

“The person who spread the news about this ancient battlefield and schemed against Green Fire World is a Sir God in Colored Glaze Sanctuary who has just broken through, Sir God Xue Dao,” Colored Glaze Great Emperor said.

“Sir God Xue Dao?” The experts at the scene revealed confused expressions.

They obviously had never heard of Sir God Xue Dao.

“Sir God Xue Dao is Emperor God Xie Xin’s junior disciple. Sword Emperor, you should know why he schemed against Green Fire World, right?” Colored Glaze Great Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold and he understood.

Emperor God Xie Xin was the first person who had discovered the ancient battlefield. But in the end, he had died by Jian Wushuang’s hands. Before Emperor God Xie Xin died, he had definitely sent a message to Sir God Xue Dao, which had led to the following agenda.

“As Sir God Xue Dao is an Almighty from Colored Glaze Sanctuary, I wonder if Colored Glaze Great Emperor would stop me if I wanted to kill him,” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No,” Colored Glaze Great Emperor answered, “Sir God Xue Dao is very cunning. I was framed too.”

“That’s great,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Sword Emperor, you don’t have to do anything about Sir God Xue Dao personally. Sanctuary Alliance will figure out a way to capture him alive and send him to you. Even if he is killed by accident, we will send his dead body over too. What do you think?” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Thank you, Ancestor Tian Chen,” Jian Wushuang thanked him and said, “That’s all. As everyone agreed with my conditions, let’s talk about the territory that Green Fire World will give out.”

Jian Wushuang immediately started another discussion with the Great Emperors.

During the discussion, it was inevitable to go through haggling. But in the end, they reached a mutual agreement.

Green Fire World would give thirty percent of their territory to the junior disciples from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World, then they could continue to reproduce there.

Green Fire World was huge and thirty percent of their territory was huge enough to take on a large number of cultivators.

Of course, Sanctuary Alliance and special tribes initially wanted more territory but Jian Wushuang was holding a strong position and it ended up with such an outcome after a fierce negotiation.

Then, both parties reached a mutual agreement.

Of course, both parties compromised in order to achieve a mutual agreement.

However, they had no other alternative but to give way. After all, both parties had scruples.
