Chapter 1160: Visiting Xuan Yi

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang easily broke into the Protective Array of the Ancient Sect and then came to the white-robed man directly.

“Master,” Jian Wushuang took a bow.

Upon hearing this, the white-robed man who had stood there with his back toward Jian Wushuang a moment ago, turned around slowly. This man was Jiang Wushuang’s master, Xuan Yi.

“You’re back.”

Xuan Yi observed Jian Wushuang and continued smiling. “It seems that you’re a Dao Master now. You’ve made much faster progress than I imagined.”

“I just had some luck,” Jian Wushuang responded humbly.

“Jian Wushuang, is this really your mysterious master who gave you Mountain River Map?” Gu King’s voice sounded inside Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, he is,” Jian Wushuang replied to Gu King.

“What’s going on?” Gu King said in a confused voice, “I’m?incredibly adept at sensing and able to see through anyone in this realm. But somehow… I cannot sense your master’s real strength.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“I perceived that your master has only reached the Eternal Realm. But if he was just at the level of Eternal Realm, how could he give you a Chaos Divine Treasure? How could he impart Secret Skills which could improve consciousness to you?” Gu King said in a deep voice.

Jian Wushuang also felt curious.

His master Xuan Yi had always been a mystery.

Jian Wushuang had been ignorant of the real identity and strength of his master before, since he was too weak to sense them.

He had expected to find out some clues to his master’s identity and strength this time.

Nevertheless, even Gu King failed to see through Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang exerted his Strength of Soul again but only found out that Xuan Yi was a common Eternal Realm.

It was uncertain whether Xuan Yi had perceived Jian Wushuang’s Strength of Soul. He still looked calm.

As he swished his hand, a long narrow table emerged ahead of Jian Wushuang along with a mat behind him.

“My dear disciple, take a seat,” said Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang sat at the long narrow table without smart talk.

“Did you get into any trouble outside? Why did you come back all of a sudden?” Xuan Yi asked.

“I didn’t get into any trouble. I’ve left for long so I wanted to come back and have a look around. By the way, fulfil some promise I made before,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“What did you refer to?” Xuan Yi asked in confusion.

“Master, do you know when Eternal Zone will be opened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Eternal Zone?” Xuan Yi was on alert. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and continued, “Why did you ask that?”

“I had stayed in Eternal Zone for a hundred years. During that period of time, the Ancient God Clan in Eternal Zone had helped me a lot. When I took leave, I promised them to visit them again and help them with some matters,” Jian Wushuang answered.

When he had been in Eternal Zone, Ancient God Clan did give him much help.

As he had Bloodline of Imperial God Clan, the three-star Ancient God Elder Yi of the Ancient God Clan had asked him to help them break Seal of the Holy Place with his Imperial Bloodline. Jian Wushuang had promised to help him.

Nevertheless, at that time, Jian Wushuang did not have enough powers to honor his promise to Elder Yi, so he left and promised to come back to help them thousands of years later.

Two thousand years had passed. Now Jian Wushuang returned to live up to his words.

“There’s no need for you to enter Eternal Zone. Even if you insist on going there, you can not enter that place,” Xuan Yi said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked, frowning.

“Eternal Zone vanished two thousand years ago,” Xuan Yi explained.

“What? Did you mean that it just disappeared?” Jian Wushuang asked, taken by great surprise.

“How? Eternal Zone had existed in Firmament Territory for hundreds of thousands of years. How did it vanish suddenly? Was this… King Gu Tong’s doing?” Jian Wushuang said, and his pupils constricted.

“Yes, King Gu Tong did this.”

Xuan Yi continued with a smile, “As you had stayed there for a while, you should’ve learnt that those Ancient Gods all believed in one King and they were subjects to him; but their King had disappeared one day suddenly, so they had come to Firmament Territory and sealed their Holy Place.”

“In fact, King Gu Tong is their King!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Are you saying that King Gu Tong is the King whom those Ancient Gods of Eternal Zone serve?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Jian Wushuang had assumed this possibility when King Gu Tong showed his powers two thousand years ago. It seemed that his assumption was correct.

“Master, what’s going on with King Gu Tong?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“King Gu Tong suffered a disaster before, which almost took his life. Although he survived with luck, he was tormented by an evil, overwhelming power inside. Owing to that evil power, he failed to regain his full strength and he even began losing his life. Later he ran into me, and we made a deal,” Xuan Yi said with a laugh.

“A deal?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“I refined an elixir and helped him erasing that evil power, and then he owed me a debt. Since then, he had been staying here and waited for a chance to pay me back. Two thousand years ago, I asked him to help Tang of the East and told him that once he helped you win the battle, he owed me nothing.”

“After returning my favor, he left with his Eternal Zone directly,” Xuan Yi continued.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang’s doubts had vanished.

He finally understood why King Gu Tong had been willing to take orders from others. Although he had not fully restored his strength, he was still a Seven-star Imperial God. As a top-notch expert, he was not likely to work for others easily. All he had done was to return Xuan Yi’s favor.

“Since King Gu Tong took over Eternal Zone, the Holy Place of Ancient God in Eternal Zone must have been opened. Now that King Gu Tong came back to those Ancient Gods, they do not need your help anymore,” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders.

He had intended to give Ancient God Clan a hand so as to fulfill his promise, but now it seemed that there was no need.

“King Gu Tong is a Seven-star Imperial God with immeasurable powers, but your master could refine an elixir to disperse the evil power that King Gu Tong failed to heal. Jian Wushuang, do you know what this means?” Jian Wushuang heard Gu King’s voice inside his head.

“What else does it mean? It proves that my master is good at refining elixir,” Jian Wushuang replied jokingly.

Of course, he was just joking. He had been thinking highly of his master all this time. Now he had an even higher opinion of his master than before.
