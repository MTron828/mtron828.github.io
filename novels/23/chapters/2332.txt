Chapter 2333: Attack!

In front of Zhuge family’s gigantic mansion, many figures were floating. Every one of them had an extremely powerful aura.

At the front of the crowd, Zhuge Yuanchong was boiling with killing intent.

“Everyone. The Lin Family and the Zhuge Family have fought for many years. Countless cultivators from the Zhuge Family have died at the hands of the Lin Family. Today, we will bring justice to our fallen brothers!” Zhuge Yuanchong said coldly. His voice reverberated in the entire space.

“Onwards, attack the Lin Mansion!”

The experts from the Zhuge Family and Tian Zuo Sect followed his orders and moved.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Hundreds of figures were headed for the Lin Mansion and they looked like a nest of bees in the sky. The weakest expert among them was in the Chaotic Realm.

Lin Mansion, within the meeting hall.

“Family head, we have received intel from the scouts that the people form the Zhuge Family have entered our territory. They will reach the Lin Mansion within half a day.” one of the elders from the Lin Family said in a serious tone.

“They are fast,” Lin Tiefeng muttered to himself. He then commanded, “Tell the experts from the Lin Mansion to prepare for battle. Also, open the Purple Virtue Hall and tell Lin Tao to protect that place well.”

“Roger.” The elder left to execute the orders.

Hundreds of people gathered within the spacious Purple Virtue Hall.

Many of the young disciples and the important family members were here. Jian Wushuang and his mother, Luo Xinqin, were part of the crowd.

The door of the hall was closed. Lin Tao and a senior brother who had a sword on his back stood near the door. During the time the Lin Family and the Zhuge Family were battling it out, they would not allow anyone to enter the Purple Virtue Hall. Of course, this meant that the people within the Purple Virtue Hall could not leave either.

The people inside the Purple Virtue Hall could only leave after the battle was over and the Zhuge Family had retreated.

The other case would be if the Lin Family lost this battle, then Lin Shou would open the door and lead everyone to escape the Lin Mansion.

“Senior Brother, thank you for protecting the Purple Virtue Hall with me,” Lin Tao said to the senior brother standing beside him.

“This is an easy job. I feel uncomfortable that I cannot fight in at the front line with Senior Sister Huo and the other experts from the Lin Family.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Lin Tao laughed awkwardly.

“Don’t worry, junior brother. The Lin Mansion is not weak. With the help of Senior Sister Huo, there shouldn’t be any problem fending off the Zhuge Family,” the man in black clothes said.

“I hope that is the case.” Lin Tao nodded his head.

Within the crowd, Jian Wushuang sat on the floor with his mother, Luo Xinqin. Jian Wushuang was calm, while his mother knitted her eyebrows anxiously.

She was worried for Zhuo Yunfeng, who would be fighting at the front line.

“Don’t worry mother. Father will come back safely.” Jian Wushuang comforted her.

“Wushuang, you know your father’s temper. It will be best if the Lin Family can emerge victorious in this battle. However, he will definitely fight with Lin Tiefeng to the end. If that is the case...” Luo Xinqin clenched her teeth tightly.

“Do not worry mother, that will not happen,” Jian Wushuang said to her with confidence.

Luo Xinqin was still extremely anxious even after Jian Wushuang comforted her.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang sighed lightly. However, his gaze was extremely sharp.

Even though he was within the Purple Virtue Hall and not on the front line, he released his soul power. Once the Lin Mansion could not handle the enemies, he would step in immediately.

“They are here.”

Jian Wushuang irises constricted. His soul power covered the entire Lin Mansion. He could sense that a large numbers of figures had descended at the front door of the Lin Mansion.

The experts from the Zhuge Family had arrived!!

...

At the door of the Lin Mansion.

A large number of experts from the Lin Mansion stood there. They waited quietly until they saw the figures that resembled a nest of bees appear in the sky.

Hundreds of figures appeared in front of them.

“Zhuge Yuanchong!!”

Lin Tiefeng raised his head. Killing intent was burning within his eyes as he glared at Zhuge Yuanchong. “Has the day finally come?”

“Haha. Lin Teifeng. I have waited for this day for a very long time. It is finally time.” Zhuge Yuanchong bellowed with laughter.

“Humph. I am not here to speak nonsense with you. You are here today to capture the Lin Family. It is a pity that you do not have the ability to do so,” Lin Tiefeng said coldly.

“What a joke! We have the ability to do so. How could the Lin Family stand in my way?” Zhuge Yuanchong sneered. He then waved his hands and shouted, “Experts from the Zhuge Family, attack! Kill everyone within this place!”

Boom!

Immediately, the hundreds of figures from the Zhuge Family attacked.

“Stop them!” Lin Tiefeng waved his hands and shouted.

The well-prepared experts from the Lin Family and those the Lin Family had sought help from charged forward.

A full scale battle started.

“Zhuge Yuanchong!!!”

Lin Tiefeng shouted with a gloomy look. He radiated a strong devilish aura and a monstrous killing intent which swept over everyone on the battlefield.

He glared at Zhuge Yuanchong, wanting to battle it out with him.

“Humph. Seems like you have completely recovered from your injuries. It is fine though, as we were prepared for this.” Zhuge Yuanchong smiled coldly. He then called out, “Elder Chen.”

Whoosh!

A figure in grey clothes appeared in front of Lin Tiefeng. It was Elder Chen from the Zuo Tian Sect.

The power of the aura that Elder Chen had was on par with that of Lin Tiefeng.

“I have heard that the head of the Lin Family has reached the peak of tier three of the Divine Demon Realm. Even though you were severely injured, you fought a tier-two Chaotic Divine Demon and survived. Today, I will have a taste of your power,” Elder Chen said indifferently.

Lin Tiefeng’s face turned dark. He felt pressured when he stood before Elder Chen.

He knew that Elder Chen’s fighting power was on par with his.

“If you want to die, don’t blame me for killing you.” Lin Tiefeng roared and attacked.

“Don’t boast about your abilities.” Elder Chen smiled in disdain.

Two peak tier-three Chaotic Divine Demons started their battles, and so did the experts from the Lin Family and the Zhuge Family.

The Lin Family was powerful. If not, they would not have been able to compete with the Zhuge Family for so many years.

The Zhuge Family sent every expert they had: three Chaotic Divine Demons. They would have four Chaotic Divine Demons including Elder Chen. They also had ten Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demons and numerous experts in the Chaotic Realm. This was an extremely powerful lineup.

On the other side, the Lin Family was not weak. They had three Chaotic Divine Demons including Lin Tiefeng. They also had more than ten Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demons. Their experts in the Chaotic Realm were more powerful than their enemies’. Both sides were equally matched.

Except in terms of Chaotic Divine Demons, as the Lin Family had one less.

Just then, an extremely violent aura swept out from within the Lin Mansion and a figure appeared on the battlefield.
