Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Wow!

A dozen of Universe God Qing Yang appeared on the training field from nowhere. Every Universe God Qing Yang looked identical, without any difference.

The dozen Universe God Qing Yangs besieged Jian Wushuang in the middle.

“Mm?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the border of the training field, there was a sudden commotion.

“Oh my God!”

“A dozen Universe God Qing Yangs?”

“This should be a secret skill. But the secret skill is very impressive. Those illusionary figures were hard to differentiate!”

“I, Universe God in the Second Heaven, couldn’t even identify his original body among these figures.”

The noise resounded in the universe.

Everyone was terrified.

Even the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang who were seated in the void above the training field were shocked too.

“The secret skill is quite bizarre. Even I couldn’t identify his original body among them. Wu Cang’s can you tell?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked.

“He’s just standing there without making a move. I can’t differentiate them as well,” Wu Cang shook his head and said, “But if he were to take action, the moment he makes a hit, there’d definitely be divine power. By then, we should be able to tell which is his original body.”

A dozen Universe God Qing Yang stood around Jian Wushuang. He couldn’t tell which was the original body and which were illusionary clones of Universe God Qing Yang.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Die!”

The dozen Universe God Qing Yangs spoke simultaneously and his voice came from all directions.

From the voices, they still couldn’t tell which was the original body of Universe God Qing Yang.

Then, the dozen Universe God Qing Yang took action before everyone’s gaze. Those Universe God Qing Yangs slowly raised the black sickles in their hands. The moment they raised their sickles, a strong power soared up into the sky.

The shocking part was that the power was derived from all directions as well. The divine power that soared up felt the same. They carried an aura of fierce divine power.

“Mm?”

Wu Cang and the Master of Dayu Palace creased their eyebrows.

“I can’t tell!”

“Even when he took action, I can’t tell which one is his original body.”

“Such an amazing secret skill,” Wu Cang said softly.

There were many secret skills that could create illusionary figures in Eternal Chaotic World.

Forget about the Eternal Chaotic World, Jian Wushuang had even encountered some in the Green Fire World.

However, even with the same kind of secret skill, the difference was ridiculously vast.

The secret skill that Universe God Qing Yang was performing, even the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang couldn’t tell which was his original body. It was really amazing.

“If he can’t identify the original body, he wouldn’t be able to identify which attacks are real and which are fake. How could he withstand the attacks then?” The Master of Dayu Palace was shocked.

“Jian Wushuang is in big trouble!” Wu Cang said.

Everyone around the training field was in terror.

The experts from Scarlet Island were worried for Jian Wushuang.

They thought Jian Wushuang was in a very bad situation.

While on the training field, Jian Wushuang who was surrounded by dozen of Universe God Qing Yang looked fairly calm. He didn’t reveal one bit of terror.

“Die!”

The shrill scream spread from all directions.

Universe God Qing Yang prepared for his attack and the dozen of Universe God Qing Yang slammed down the black sickle in their hands.

Suddenly, there was overa dozen pitch-black faint lights that permeated the air in a similar manner and charged at Jian Wushuang from all directions.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted and he squeezed the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand but his eyes were fixed on one of the sword lights. Then, he lifted his sword and swung it straightforwardly.

Swoosh!

The sword light swept and collided directly with that faint light.

Dang!

A deep clashing sound immediately resounded in the void.

“What?”

Everyone around the training field was caught by surprise.

Including the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang in the void, who revealed a shocking expression.

Even though the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang were both Universe God of the Third Heaven, they couldn’t differentiate the fake and real attack from where they were standing.

But then, Jian Wushuang took action and found the real attack straightaway.

Shattered. The void was torn and there was an enormous amount of divine power dispersing.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and charged forward. He immediately appeared before one of the Universe God Qing Yang.

Then, he swung the Blood Mountain Sword directly.

The Universe God Qing Yang before Jian Wushuang immediately revealed an expression of disbelief.

“How is it possible?”

“How could he know which is my original body?”

“This technique, even Universe God in the Second Heaven couldn’t differentiate. Even for Universe God in the Third Heaven, if they were to only watch from the side, they might not be able to differentiate. But, Jian Wushuang, he was just a Universe Master, he could see through my technique and find my original body with one glance?”

Universe God Qing Yang was extremely shocked but he quickly responded.

“So what if you found my original body? You still have to die!”

Universe God Qing Yang’s glare was cold and the surrounding illusionary figure vanished immediately. There was suddenly a black secret pattern that rapidly emerged on his body.

The black secret pattern surfaced and it covered his body in that instant. It even covered the black sickle of his hand.

With the black secret pattern, his aura – which was already fierce – became even more ferocious.

“Kill!”

Universe God Qing Yang swung his black sickle and suddenly clashed with Jian Wushuang’s.

Then, they were having close combat!

Clash! Clash! Clash! Clash! Clash! Clash!

The continuous clashing sound reverberated in the universe. It was so loud that every clash was deafening.

Both Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang’s power erupted entirely.

Jian Wushuang gave full play to his power and triggered the second layer of power in his Blood-killing Plate Armor. Most importantly, after his Blood Mountain Sword integrated with Eternal Lightning, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword increased tremendously. When Jian Wushuang let out his power entirely, his power could be one notch above an ordinary Peak Universe God in the First Heaven!

As for Universe God Qing Yang, after the black secret pattern surfaced, his divine power erupted entirely and it was not any weaker than Jian Wushuang’s.

Both their strengths were comparable.

Hence, they could only compete on their techniques, swordsmanship, strokes and killing power!

But both of them were even competing on their madness!

“Bang!”

The loud clash broke out and a corner of the void was broken in the next moment. The speed that both of them fought was extremely quick.

The people watching around looked and stunned. Even the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven were shocked by the ferocious battle.

Fierce!

Mad!

Terrifying!

That battle was hardly seen in a billion years within Dayu World.

The sky was bellowing while the land was shaking!

The battle was really earth shattering!
