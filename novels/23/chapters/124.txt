Chapter 125: The Sword Tomb Guard

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In fact, the sword tomb was fraught with jeopardy, but Jian Wushuang had no idea about it. He was immersed in the comprehension of those sword marks which contained a profusion of mysterious sword essences for him to explore.

“This move combined the Sword Essences of Raging Fire and the Waterdrop perfectly. Though water and fire are originally incompatible, why?were these two Sword Essences able to be perfectly combined?”

“This move is so fast and sharp. The Sword Essence of Gale...”

“Darkness. Endless darkness. What is the sword essence of this sword mark?”

While probing the sword marks one by one, Jian Wushuang noticed that the sword essences of Earth, Gale, Raging Fire, and Waterdrop were the most common essences for the sword marks. However, there were also sword marks containing essences that were different from those four sword essences.

“Besides Earth, Gale, Raging Fire, and Waterdrop, are there other sword essences in the world?”?Jian Wushuang couldn’t help considering this.

To observe, meditate, probe, and finally understand it slowly.

Under such circumstances, he began to improve his speed of comprehending sword essence at an alarming rate.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

In the Sword Tomb, Jian Wushuang was sitting on the barren land with his legs crossed and there was a sword scar in front of him. This powerful sword scar perfectly combined the Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire.

“How do I combine two different sword essences completely?”?Jian Wushuang was contemplating.

After comprehending different kinds of sword essence, It was not only possible to perfectly transition between them, but to also combine them.

When two sword essences were combined, a sword stroke could contain both sword essences while complementing each other. The power of the sword would reach an even higher level. Jian Wushuang had comprehended four sword essences and definitely hoped to combine them.

But at this moment…

Boom... The whole sword tomb shook violently.

Not far away from the Void, there was an Absolute Beauty with a cold-faced watching this scene. Suddenly, she lifted the corner of her mouth and said, “A month is up.”

“It’s the sword tomb guard,” said a sturdy and ingenious man that was standing nearby with a serious complexion, “I don’t know if this little guy can defeat the sword tomb guard.”

“Defeat?” The Absolute Beauty giggled. “It is the sword tomb guard that I arranged in person. He will be lucky if he is able to survive their attack. When it comes to defeating Sword Tomb guard, I don’t think he has what it takes.”

“Trust me.”

Obviously, the Absolute Beauty was very confident in the Sword Tomb guard.

The whole Sword Tomb was shaking violently.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang stood up, with a trace of vigilance, and began examining the area.

Crack!

One of the scars on the ground of the Sword Tomb abruptly cracked. Then that crack began expanding. After which, a giant figure slowly climbed out of that crack.

This was a nearly two-meter-tall Rock Giant.

the Rock Giant’s body was made of rocks, but he had the same form as a human in regards to the hands, feet, and head. But, there was no nose, mouth, or ears on the head, and only empty dark sockets with two red lights where the eyes should have been.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He had never seen a creature entirely made of rock.

This Rock Giant held a giant sword in his hands, which was also made of stone. Although there was no sword edge, the giant sword itself had its own strength.

After the Rock Giant appeared, the two red light in the empty eye sockets instantly locked onto Jian Wushuang. The soles of his feet kicked on the ground and the huge body rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

Holding the Triple-kill Sword, Jian Wushuang’s expression grew gloomy.

“Look, the Sword Tomb guard has begun to move.”

The Absolute Beauty hidden in the void smiled slightly and said, “Pray that the little boy can hold on for at least an hour after the Sword Tomb guard begins to attack. If he lasts an hour, he will be able to keep his life...”

Before she could even finish her words, the Absolute Beauty was suddenly stunned.

The nearby sturdy and ingenious man was shocked as well, and his expression became odd.

With a cold look in his eyes, Jian Wushuang directly and violently swung the Triple-kill Sword when the Sword Tomb guard dashed toward him in a frenzy.

The Sword Tomb guard’s body was pierced by a gloomy sword light at an amazing speed, and then the bulky Sword Tomb guard was smashed by a formidable power.

The bulky body of the sword tomb guard was scattered into a profusion of rock fragments.

It only took an instant for the Sword Tomb guard to be defeated.

“What...” The Absolute Beauty above the void was too shocked to speak.

“He killed the Sword Tomb guard in a single move?” The sturdy and ingenious man also felt it was unbelievable.

“It’s his strength.” The face of Absolute Beauty was cold. “His power is very high. He obviously just reached the Gold Core Realm. However, his strength is at least comparable to the normal warriors in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm! ”

“My Lady, you miscalculated.” The sturdy and ingenious man looked at her.

“How could I know that his power was this strong?” The Absolute Beauty shouted with a low voice. “I thought he was just an ordinary warrior in the Initial Gold Core Realm. So I arranged for him to compete with a Sword Tomb guard at the same level as his. But I am surprised. He is stronger than a normal warrior at the same level,?so the Sword Tomb guard was defeated in one move.”

The Sword Tomb guard was not suddenly born. It was actually arranged by this absolute beauty.

However, the Sword Tomb guard she arranged was based on the Jian Wushuang’s realm.

When Jian Wushuang came to the Ancestor’s Land, he was dying and his aura was at the Initial Gold Core Realm. Therefore, the Absolute Beauty selected a Sword Tomb guard at the same level.

If Jian Wushuang was really a normal warrior in the Initial Gold Core Realm, he would not have defeated the Sword Tomb guard so easily.

But what was the result?

The truth is that Jian Wushuang is in the Initial Gold Core Realm, but his strength is comparable to someone in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, or maybe even someone stronger. Who could expect that?

The Absolute Beauty also did not expect it.?Thus, the first Sword Tomb guard she arranged was quickly defeated by Jian Wushuang’s single move.

“He was lucky. But his luck won’t last,” said the Absolute Beauty in a muffled voice. ” Regard him as a warrior of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm and change the Sword Tomb guard.”

“This...” the sturdy and ingenious man asked, “My Lady, isn’t this little guy really just at the Initial Gold Core Realm? It’s unfair to treat him the same as someone in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.”

“Oh, unfair? Though he is in the Initial Gold Core Realm, his strength is greater than the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. It’s natural to treat him like someone in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. You should do what I say without hesitation,” the Absolute Beauty said.

“Okay.” The robust man nodded slowly and then rearranged it.
