Chapter 439: The Dragon King Bow

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

A roar suddenly rang out and the whole chamber started shaking violently.

“The fight has started?”

An Feng perceived the sound and began counting. “A breath of time, two...”

Soon, 10 breaths of time passed and the secret chamber became quiet.

“It seems that he made it,” An Feng said with a faint smile.

Jian Wushuang looked pale while gasping for breath. The Puppet Fighter had returned to the center of the secret chamber and closed its eyes.

“How powerful!”?Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

Although 10 breaths of time was something transient, Jian Wushuang still felt that he had just experienced a big fight.

His Saint Realm strength was nothing when compared to the battle strength of the lord level.

Fortunately, he only had to fight with a Puppet Fighter whose offensive skills were not complicated. Because of that, he was able to hold on for 10 breaths of time.

If he had to fight with a real lord, he was not sure whether he could stick it out for the 10 breaths of time.

Jian Wushuang slowly walked toward the Interspatial Ring placed at the end of the chamber.

Standing before the ring, he hesitated for a while. Then he stretched out his hand towards the ring which was surrounded by gray energy.

He immediately felt something. He did not know what it was, but he subconsciously grasped it and withdrew his hand.

A streak of gold light followed his hand out of the gray energy area.

“This is...”

Jian Wushuang stared at the object in his hand with a hint of astonishment.

It was a gold longbow with a sharp golden arrow.

“A bow?”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly, but he immediately felt that it was an extraordinary longbow.

It was covered with many mysterious cracks, and it almost seemed as if it was alive. Jian Wushuang held the longbow and it felt like it weighed thousands of kilogram. The tip of the sharp golden arrow also frightened him.

“Let me bind it first.”

Jian Wushuang immediately used his blood to bind it to himself. After that, he felt a rush of information surge into his mind.

“The first-grade magic weapon, Dragon King Bow!”

Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

“First-grade!”

“A first-grade magic weapon?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jian Wushuang was totally dumbfounded.

He knew that the treasures in this Interspatial Ring would be amazing.

However, he did not expect that he would be so lucky as to receive a first-grade magic weapon!

First-grade magic weapons were rare even in the Divine Land.

Inside the Marquis Piaoxue’s Treasure Vault, there were less than 10 first-grade magic weapons. Moreover, they were all longswords, sabers, or Giant Axes, which were normally aggressive weapons. No first-grade magic weapons that were similar to this bow could be found there.

It didn’t take long for Jian Wushuang to understand how powerful the Dragon King Bow was.

The Dragon King Bow was made from a Demonic Blood Dragon at the lord level.

The body of the bow and the bowstring were created by using its hardest bone and its tendon.

The sharp golden arrow, known as the Dragon King Arrow, was actually the sharpest horn on the Demonic Blood Dragon.

The Dragon King Bow had been created using the three most valuable parts of a Demonic Blood Dragon.

“A first-grade magic weapon, how about its power?”?Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of expectance.

Then he began testing the bow inside the secret chamber. He gripped the bowstring with his right hand and pulled it back with his full strength.

Buzz...

The instant he began to draw the bowstring, his mighty Spiritual Power crazily surged toward the bow, but he could only draw out 10 percent of the Full Draw.

“Phew!” Jian Wushuang exhaled a breath.

Then he slowly put down the Dragon King Bow.

“It is worthy of being a first-grade magic weapon. I tried my best but could only handle 10 percent of the Full Draw.”?Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

He could not display its full power.

However, he felt its terrifying power while drawing the bow.

Furthermore, he had not used the Dragon King Arrow.

“Good stuff.”?Jian Wushuang was privately delighted.

Then an idea flashed through his mind. He immediately turned his hand over and a transparent jade bottle appeared. He opened it and let a small amount of white fluid flow out.

The white fluid was the venom Jian Wushuang had gained from refining the Icy Heart Poison.

Icy Heart Poison was the most frightening venom that Jian Wushuang had ever seen.

Now that venom was flowing towards the Dragon King Arrow, where it quickly merged with the arrow tip.

After that, the gold arrow tip became extremely white, which would terrify people.

Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Even a lord should be unable to detoxify his body if this arrow pricks his skin.”?Jian Wushuang thought with a flicker of craftiness in his eyes.

As a first-grade magic weapon, the Dragon King Bow combined with the Dragon King Arrow was more than powerful enough.

With the aid of the Icy Heart Poison, it could strike terror into any lords’ heart.

“From now on, I have one more terrifying trump card!”?Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.

Once he calmed down, he left the secret chamber.

“Sir.”

An Feng, who had been waiting outside, walked over and said, “It looks like you’re very satisfied with the treasure you received.”

“Yeah, not bad,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile, but he was actually quite satisfied in his heart.

“Please take me to the place?with the second opportunity!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.”

An Feng led the way and they quickly arrived at a side palace.

The palace was spacious and without any decoration. There was only a Thunderbolt Pool, with a large number of Purple Thunderbolts, placed at the center of the area.

Even though he was standing?so far away from the pool, Jian Wushuang still felt that those thunderbolts were terrifying.

“Sir, this is the second opportunity Marquis Beimo left, the Universal Thunderbolt Pool!”
