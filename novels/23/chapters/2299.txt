Chapter 2300 Learning the Sword

“Don’t be so polite, those are all exaggerated compliments. This boy has been beside me for eight years, I don’t see anything special about him,” Zhuo Yunfeng laughed.Lin Yi smiled but paused to say, “Brother Yunfeng, I know why you have invited me today, but forgive me. The young Lord was born by the sword, his name bestowed by the great Taoist Priest Xuan Shen. In terms of Sword Principle, I’m afraid no one in the entire Anjiu Commandery can compare to him. How do I guide such a Sword Principle genius?”

Lin Yi was self-aware. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He was decent at sword cultivation and Sword Principle and would have no problem teaching any ordinary boy, but teaching a sword principle genius, or a monster, would not be very realistic.

“Haha, you’re too humble, Brother Lin Yi. Your understanding of Sword Principle is amongst the top thirty in Anjiu Commandery. No matter how talented Shuang is, he’s only a boy. Having you as his guide will be more than enough, I only need you to lead him to the gates of Sword Principle. After that, I’ll think of a way to get him to train at some ancient sects,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“I see,” Lin Yi understood.

He did not have the confidence to teach Jian Wushuang continuously.

But if it was just to help Jian Wushuang, the boy who had yet make contact with Sword Principle, enter the threshold, he would not refuse such a simple request.

“Brother Yunfeng, you said that the boy had no contact with Sword Principle?” Lin Yi asked.

“Yeap, and he’s only eight years old. His mother dotes on him a lot and restricted him from training until he was ten. I simply brought the training two years forward. In terms of Sword Principle, he’s only watching others practice swordsmanship, he himself has never touched a sword,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

Jian Wushuang was laughing from the bottom of his heart.

He had indeed not performed much swordsmanship over the past eight years, but who said Sword Principle understanding needed one to possess a sword?

Jian Wushuang could understand it from breaking a twig on the floor.

Jian Wushuang even shook his head at the thought of Zhuo Yunfeng getting Lin Yi to coach him.

It was not that Jian Wushuang underestimated Lin Yi. Lin Yi was really just not good enough for Jian Wushuang. A Peak Chaotic Realm whose Sword Principle could only make the top thirty within Anjiu Commandery, how strong could he be?

Lin Yi himself had probably only entered the threshold of Sword Principle.

Of course, Jian Wushuang kept those thoughts to himself.

“How about this, Brother Yunfeng: I’ll demonstrate a swordsmanship skill, and get the boy to repeat it. We’ll see how talented he is,” Lin Yi said.

“Okay,” Zhuo Yunfeng nodded.

With a flick of his hand, Lin Yi was holding a normal longsword.

It was a performance, after all, he only required a normal sword.

“Boy, are you ready?” Lin Yi smiled and watched Jian Wushuang.

“Shuang, watch closely,” Zhuo Yunfeng instructed.

“Okay, I will,” Jian Wushuang responded quickly.

Lin Yi started his performance.

Weng~

As the sword moved, a faint echo of a sword could be heard as the sword shadow cut across the Void.

“It’s Lin Clan’s Sword Principle Bei Ming,” Zhuo Yunfeng raised his eyebrow as he recognised the swordsmanship. A faint smile could be seen on his face.

He knew that the Sword Principle Bei Ming Lin Yi was performing was the most appropriate one.

It was too high level, and it was not considered simple.

Using such swordsmanship to test a person’s Sword Principle talent may have been too harsh on others, but Jian Wushuang’s fame demanded nothing less from him.

Evidently, Lin Yi truly wanted to guide Jian Wushuang.

Within a moment, the swordsmanship was performed.

There were nine moves in the Sword Principle Bei Ming.

It covered attacks and defence, a considerably comprehensive swordsmanship indeed.

After he was done, Lin Yi looked over at Jian Wushuang. “Boy, you caught that?”

“Yep, I did,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Do you understand it?” Lin Yi asked.

“I do,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Lin Yi and Zhuo Yunfeng were elated.

Jian Wushuang was confident, and that raised their hopes.

“Come, boy, try doing the same.” Lin Yi passed the sword to Jian Wushuang.

“Shuang, follow what Uncle Lin Yi says,” Zhuo Yunfeng instructed.

Jian Wushuang laughed awkwardly and took over the sword as he walked forward.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Yi stood side by side.

“Brother Lin Yi, how do you think he’ll perform?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked casually.

“I dare not say, but the boy looks confident... I think he’ll understand at least 20% of the hidden secrets of the Sword Principle Bei Ming,” Lin Yi said.

“Twenty percent?”

“So high?” Zhuo Yunfeng was startled.

All swordsmanship had hidden secrets within.

Sword Principle Bei Ming contained deeper, more profound mysteries than simple sword principles.

If Jian Wushuang could perform 20% of it, he would be considered an extraordinary genius.

“Brother Yunfeng, you underestimate the young Lord. His name was bestowed by the Taoist Priest Xuan Shen himself. ‘Unparalleled in Sword Principle’. That’s a name not everyone can own. 20% is if I’m being conservative. Perhaps even 30% or 40%,” Lin Yi replied.

“Haha, I’m not expecting that much. Even 10% would make me content. If you could watch a performance once and understand even 10%, I’d hail that person as a genius.” Zhuo Yunfeng smiled, his gaze full of expectation.

At the training field, Jian Wushuang was beginning to practise his swordsmanship.
