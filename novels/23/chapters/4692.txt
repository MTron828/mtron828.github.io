4693 The Three Lively Emperors (1)

Taking a deep breath, the tall and thin old man, who did not dare to stop, did not forget to turn around and shout, “Boy, I advise you to retreat quickly. I will let bygones be bygones for your previous offense!”

“Otherwise, my iron-fisted methods are not something you can withstand!”

“Why is this guy so long-winded?” Jian Wushuang was speechless. He had seen too many fights where people would draw their swords and cut each other at the slightest disagreement. He did not even know how to attack such a kind old man.

Judging from the ‘troubles’ that the Young Emperor had mentioned, the purpose of this visit to Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes was to eliminate the True Souls of these old Emperors.

Jian Wushuang had never been an indecisive person. He had too many things to do in the Great Yan Domain. It was impossible for him to be imprisoned in the black mountain.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang aimed at the tall and thin old man and slashed down. An extremely sharp Sword Intent rose.

The tall and thin old man was shocked. Almost instinctively, he dodged to the side and barely dodged the terrifying attack.

At this point, one was running, while the other was chasing.

Even though the tall and thin old man was only in the form of a divine soul, his Yan power was mighty. Jian Wushuang could not do anything to him for a while.

However, given enough time, a random hit will land eventually. Jian Wushuang waved his sword behind the old man, and one of the swords stabbed the old man’s butt, making him scream like a pig being plucked.

“How dare you sneak attack me?! I’ll whip your soul in the future!” The tall and thin old man did not care about covering his injured area, and turned his head to threaten.

Jian Wushuang felt helpless. At the same time, he began to doubt if this chatterbox was really an Emperor…

After another round of confrontation, the Invisible Sword cut a few more wounds on the tall and thin old man’s body, causing him to curse in pain.

Jian Wushuang ignored him and focused on eliminating the ‘troubles’ in the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes.

Perhaps he knew that he had lost the battle and could not escape, the tall and thin old man simply stood in place, waiting to be killed.

Caught off guard, Jian Wushuang almost stabbed him with his sword.

The old man placed his hands behind his back and laughed loudly. “Good boy. Even if I am a God today, I still want you to pass a message to that old man Zhen Wuyang. Tell him that Yang Jun died with regrets. His biggest regret is not being able to see you in mourning and be a filial son for once. Hahaha!”

“…”

Jian Wushuang’s face was full of black lines.

“Come on, kill me and go back to claim your prize!” the tall and thin old man opened his arms and said.

There was a flash of hesitation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, and he put down the Invisible Sword that he had raised.

Judging from the tall and thin old man’s behavior, he was not an evil person. On the contrary, he had some real temperament.

The world fell silent for a moment. The tall and thin old man had a tragic expression and waited for the blow that did not come.

“Do you have any way to hide your aura, or to leave this place and never set foot here again?” Jian Wushuang withdrew his long sword and said indifferently.

The tall and thin old man was stunned, obviously still unable to react. “You’re not going to kill me? ”

“I’m too lazy to kill you,” Jian Wushuang said concisely.

The tall and thin old man’s expression immediately became interesting. “Good boy, I knew you were full of righteousness. How could you associate with shameless people like Zhen Wuyang? I was right!”

“Don’t interrupt. Let’s get down to business and leave this place,” Jian Wushuang said helplessly.

The tall and thin old man scratched his head, his face troubled.

In the next moment, the sky and earth suddenly changed color. The clouds were like the sky sea, surging and changing.

“Who dares to trespass into the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes?”

A low roar that carried mighty Yan power resounded through the universe and rushed over.

Even Jian Wushuang’s calm heart trembled.

The tall and thin old man saw this ever-changing scene and immediately became impatient. “This old thing, every time he appears, it’s like he’s performing in a big singing show. He’s really degrading himself!”

“…”

Immediately after, an old man with a extraordinary majesty rode the wind over. He was also wearing an Emperor’s robe. Although he was also in tatters, it could not hide his terrifying strength.

Their eyes met and Jian Wushuang activated Yan power almost immediately.

On the other hand, the tall and thin old man was extremely calm. He raised his head and shouted, “Old man Daogong, come down quickly and receive the guests!”

“…” Jian Wushuang’s face was full of black lines.

“You old thing, you were crying for help just now. Now that I’m here to support you, you’re acting tough again?” The old man who was still in the clouds rolled up his sleeves and rushed down. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The tall and thin old man pouted and dodged a flying kick with great familiarity. He said, “Old thing, hurry up and be serious. This concerns the three of us.”

Hearing this, the majestic elder acted as if nothing had happened. He rolled up his sleeves and looked at Jian Wushuang warily. “Zhen Wuyang asked you to persuade us to surrender?”

“You’re wrong. This kid is definitely not on good terms with Zhen Wuyang,” the tall and thin old man said.

“Then what are you here for?” The awe-inspiring elder examined Jian Wushuang again.

“It’s a personal matter, so I have no choice but to come here to cleanse this Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes,” Jian Wushuang said. “I don’t want to kill for no reason, so I would like to ask you two to leave and never set foot here again.”

As Jian Wushuang’s voice fell, an angry roar came from the clouds, “You’re talking nonsense, ignorant child!”

This time, before Jian Wushuang could react, the tall and thin old man and the awe-inspiring elder attacked at the same time. Two rays of Yan power shot directly into the clouds and the voice disappeared.

“What’s your relationship with Zhen Wuyang?” the old man asked.

Jian Wushuang said directly, “I don’t know any Zhen Wuyang. I came here to eliminate you guys because I had no choice.”

“What if we don’t leave?”

“Then I have no choice but to purge this place,” Jian Wushuang said slowly.

The awe-inspiring old man laughed out of anger. His Yan power was so solid that it turned into hundreds of sharp awls and pointed at him.

“Just because you say so? Aren’t you going to pray for your life?”

“We can discuss things. Using brute force is too vulgar!” the tall and thin old man said hurriedly.

Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang with a flash of embarrassment in his eyes. “It’s not that we don’t want to leave, but outside of the Daogong, all of that Realm belongs to the old man Zhen Wuyang. Once he senses us, even our True Souls will be dissipated.”

“So, we can’t leave this Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes. We can’t go back.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. If they did not leave, Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes would not be cleaned out. If he could not purge this place, the young Emperor would not let him leave.

Just as he was hesitating, the sound of something breaking through the air came from behind him. Chun Qiu, who was slightly out of breath, flew over.

“Brother Jian, so you’re here. I’ve been looking for you.”

The tall and thin old man’s nose twitched. He looked at Chun Qiu and asked, “The aura of a treasure?”

Chun Qiu did not know what was going on, but he was on his guard.

“How could this kid have the smell of the Boyang Bottle on him?” the tall and skinny old man said in a low voice.
