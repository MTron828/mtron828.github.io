Chapter 2115 Unhindered

“Four levels?” Jian Wushuang gently nodded. “Thanks for letting me know.”“With the secret skill in our hands, Sword Emperor and I shall take our leave. Remember, Jue Xian, never tell anyone about this incident. We never visited you, understood?” Red Dragon King instructed.

“Understood.”

Jian Wushuang and the Red Dragon King left after a moments notice.

Only after they had left did Emperor God Jue Xian start to relax. His eyes were still gleaming with light.

“A spot in the Palace, I actually did it?” Emperor God Jue Xian’s excitement could not be contained.

Before all of that, he could never have imagined entering the Palace.

But Jian Wushuang’s appearance had given him a glimpse of hope. Even with that, he did not have high hopes the Sanctuary Alliance would actually allocate him a seat.

In the end…

“All thanks to the Sword Emperor!”

“It was rumoured that this Sword Emperor slaughtered mercilessly during his conquests. Even during the Lineage of Star battle, he took down more than a hundred Almighties!”

“But looking at him now, he’s a nicer person than I had imagined. A good negotiator too.”

Emperor God Jue Xian fumbled for a while, before making his decision. “The Palace is my last hope! I will make the best of it!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

…

Within the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

“Thank you for helping me out, Red Dragon King,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Not a problem, you are most welcome to visit whenever you are free,” Red Dragon King replied.

“Haha, sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded before taking his leave.

Jian Wushuang returned to the Green Fire World and started analysing the Three Divine Lights secret skill.

There was still a period of time before the Heaven Repairing Palace would be activated. Naturally he would try to cultivate while he could.

Twenty years passed.

Within those twenty years, the twelve seats for the Palace were selected. It was about time to activate the Palace.

….

Three Emperors World, within the dark Void.

Once there were three thrones within the Void, now there were four.

Besides Leng Ruxue, Kaiser Blood and Demon King Chen Yu, a new red-robed elder sat in the a new throne. His hair and brows were all flaming red.

He was a ball of fire, his flames felt as if they had burned through eras.

Through the eras, the fire had shown no traces of extinguishment, but rather it grew to be more intense.

He was Lord Fen, oldest amongst the Three Emperors World, and a Third Stage Great Emperor.

He sat beside Leng Ruxue, his aura pressing down upon Demon King Chen Yu.

Demon King Chen Yu’s face darkened. “Old Fen, we’ve been friends for years, is there a need for this?”

“Hngh, I just wanted to see how much you’ve improved. So many years, nothing. Not unexpected,” Lord Fen snorted.

“Asshole, who do you think I am? My powers have long reached their limits since the Ancient Era, I’m restricted under these heavens, you should know this, right?” Demon King Chen Yu replied.

“Oh, I forgot,” Lord Fen laughed, with a tinge of sarcasm in his tone.

“Stop it, the both of you,” Kaiser Blood at the front finally opened his mouth.

Lord Fen raised his eyebrow and stopped talking.

“Lord Fen, you were severely injured during your previous fight with Emperor Bai. After all these years… you should know him best,” Kaiser Blood said.

“Emperor Bai…” Lord Fen’s face darkened. He had a grudge.

“His power doesn’t mean much back in our Era, but now … terrifying would be an understatement. That battle with him? I was suppressed completely. Based on the First Era divisions, I’m close to pinnacle Third Stage levels, but I know for sure that if I were to fight him now, I wouldn’t stand a chance.”

“Hmm? Kaiser Blood’s pupils widened.

“It’s how he cultivated himself . He learned Inverse Cultivation, completely different from what I learnt. In this era, under the restrictions of these heavens I can only utilise Peak Chaotic Realm powers. But Emperor Bai, he had no restrictions!”

“When I fought him, I could feel it. His foundation powers were already beyond Chaotic Realm powers.”

After pausing, Lord Fen continued, “He already has the advantage based on pure strength, along with the Rules of Order and secret skills he has learnt, combine that together and you get an expert so strong almost no one from the First Era can hope to surpass him.”

“Such fighting power makes him invincible in this era!”

“No offence, Kaiser Blood, but even though your Rules of Order are better than his under the restraints we are placed under, I’m afraid you are not his match.”

Kaiser Blood’s eyes went even more bloodshot.

“Meaning to say, I have underestimated this Emperor Bai.” His smile was ice-cold, sharp like a blade. “Inverse Cultivation? Who created this system? How could it be so powerful as to ignore the restrictions these heavens have placed upon us?”

“I’m not sure,” Lord Fen shook his head. “According to what I know, Emperor Bai was the first Inverse Cultivator. There have been others after him, but their achievements were limited. None of them reached Chaotic Realm powers.”

As Lord Fen finished, Leng Ruxue responded, “Now there’s a second one, Jian Wushuang. His Inverse Cultivation is now at Chaotic Realm powers, next to Emperor Bai.”
