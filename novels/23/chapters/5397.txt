Jian Wushuang’s brow flickered as a massive eye manifested in the center of his forehead. When the seven Emperors looked at Jian Wushuang, they felt as if they were facing a colossal eye, losing themselves in an instant.

Without even making a move, these individuals revealed their true forms and heavily plummeted to the sea level.

Crack!

The bodies of these sea monsters began to shatter, turning into fine powder, leaving only seven strands of the origin source.

Jian Wushuang casually grasped them and stored them in the bracelet on his wrist, a device specifically designed for storing the origin source that he bought on Redwood Island.

After these individuals completely perished, ripples once again stirred the sea.

That glance just now was the intimidation of the Beast God’s Eye, instantly suppressing and killing these sea monsters.

However, unless Bai Junwang mentioned it, Jian Wushuang didn’t realize that these individuals were actually sea monsters.

They had transformed into the appearance of humans, making it difficult to distinguish.

Originally, he came to hunt and kill them, so there was nothing more to be said. When encountering them, he simply exterminated them.

In the intelligence he gathered, it was recorded that sea monsters above the Emperor level had high intelligence and could easily disguise themselves as humans to deceive human Emperors.

Jian Wushuang had almost been fooled by these sea monsters just now.

If it weren’t for his strength as an Emperor, there might have been a major battle here today.

Sea monsters had individual strength superior to that of humans, especially in the sea.

Unfortunately for them, they encountered Jian Wushuang.

“The Swirling Sea Region!” Jian Wushuang hovered in mid-air, only a foot above the calm sea surface,

Although it appeared calm on the surface, hidden currents surged in its depths.

With his psychic power spreading for millions of miles, assimilating the seawater with his own psychic power, Jian Wushuang slowly descended.

The underwater world was vibrant and colorful, with its own unique charm, but danger accompanied it.

A large group of sea monsters roamed within.

The weakest among them were at the level of Earth Immortals.

In the Swirling Sea, only Yan Immortals could survive.

Jian Wushuang, like a sharp sword, delved deep into the sea for millions of miles, and the pressure of the sea did not hinder his speed at all.

His body technique had long surpassed the constraints of the wind, not confined to the land or sky.

Space encompasses the universe.

Jian Wushuang remained agile and flexible even underwater. His spatial origin source had reached the level of a black hole. With mastery over black holes, he could freely traverse and even merge with the seawater into his origin source, controlling a domain of the sea.

Similar to how those Emperors in the Original Universe controlled their worlds.

Of course, those Emperors controlled the cumulative origin sources of the world. At the black hole level, even without an origin source, one could control everything in the world.

“Let the hunt begin!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, and a tremendous force stirred the seawater.

Bai Junwang also revealed a trace of ferocity.

After wasting hundreds of years, Jian Wushuang finally began his blood sacrifice again, using the origin source of sea monsters. There was no need for the troublesome process of plundering cultivators anymore.

It wasn’t much of a difference. Just a hundred years here would be enough to gather sufficient origin source. By then, he could open the blood sacrifice and refine the origin source, completing the process.

In the God’s Tomb, on the God Tomb Mountain.

Since the inheritor arrived here, Zhen Ling had condensed a divine body, often lecturing the inheritors.

At the peak of Grave God Mountain, Zhen Ling overlooked the entire God’s Tomb, holding a trinket in hand, contemplating with a furrowed brow.

“Tsk tsk, still unyielding. It seems the last time didn’t hurt you enough!” Zhen Ling muttered to himself, but his gaze saw through the deep space to another world.

In that place, magma surged, and if Jian Wushuang saw it, he would undoubtedly recognize the scene. It was the same as what he had witnessed in the Trial Tower.

He could never forget the sight of looking down at the magma from the iron chains, the surging of ancient beasts, and the boundless power.

A gigantic dragon had always dwelled there. Sensing the gaze of Zhen Ling, it shivered and opened its eyes.

The two of them faced each other across countless spaces and voids.

Zhen Ling glanced over and extended a claw, causing the giant dragon to stagger.

“Haha, coward!”

“Since I can’t kill you, I’ll infuriate you to death!” Zhen Ling revealed an evil smile, his sinister gaze receding as he began scheming.

In the current Earth Realm, he always felt an uneasy sensation, suspecting that it was Shen Ling of the Giant God Clan, suppressed deep within, causing trouble.

The last time he intervened, that guy didn’t learn his lesson.

Zhen Lings small eyes rolled around, his beard shaking a few times before he thought of a perfect opportunity.

“Long Yi!’

Long Yi, who hadn’t been out of the Earth Realm for long, had just returned to his lair. Upon hearing Zhen Lings call, he hadn’t even taken a sip of his drink before reluctantly taking another step, leaving the Bloodthirst Continent once again.

Zhen Ling, however, was nonchalant, finding that he quite liked using Long Yi.

Threads of power manipulated a certain part of the Earth Realm, steering things in the direction he planned.

No one knew about all of this.

In the molten purgatory of the Giant God tribe, Shen Ling moved his body a few times, his gaze furtive. He muttered to himself, “Damn it, why is that old man eyeing me again? Is it because Bai Junwangs origin source is about to be refined?”

Last time, Zhen Ling messed up his plans. Now, he had to rely on Bai Junwang. It was difficult enough to obtain someone like Jian Wushuang back then; trying to get another successor was too challenging.

“No, Bai Junwang is crucial to the overall situation. I can’t be discovered. I need to create some commotion to divert that old man’s attention.’ Meanwhile, Shen Ling began plotting a major event in the Earth Realm.

This was also what Zhen Ling wanted to see.

This matter originated from Jian Wushuang but had nothing to do with him.

In the Earth Realm, in the Western Sea, on Redwood Island.

The business of the Stellar Pavilion, located nearby, was well-known in the area.

This was all because the pavilion’s owner was a legendary female Emperor, whose glory had once shone brightly but had now fallen due to the shortcomings of her inheritance.

The headquarters of the Stellar Pavilion had also moved from the seabed to Redwood Island, where many Emperors and Dao Lords came to mourn.

The Emperor left behind a daughter, and no one knew who her father was. Now, she had also reached tier 3.

Looking at the fleeting clouds, the Holy Maiden of the Stellar Pavilion, the only daughter of the pavilion’s owner, showed no excessive sadness in her eyes, only a sense of closure.

Her mother had actually fallen long ago, but as for why they hadn’t announced her death, it was due to internal reasons within the Stellar Pavilion.

Before Gongyun!s fall, she was a tier 4 Emperor, reigning over the Stellar Pavilion and dominating the nearby seas as a supreme force. Now, with her

mother gone, as a tier 3 Emperor, she couldn’t hold sway over the situation.

Especially with the three elders within the Stellar Pavilion, all tier 4 Emperors, one of them being a top tier 4 Emperor. Without the intimidation of her mother, these individuals wouldn’t listen to her.

If they were to learn that Empress Gongyun had already fallen, the entire Stellar Pavilion might have devoured these people by now.

The reason for choosing to announce it now was also a move of necessity.

In each epoch, the Master of the Stellar Pavilion personally led the stars to offer blessings to the Emperors of the Stellar Pavilion in the deep sea.

Now, the time was imminent. If they didn’t announce it now, it would be even more difficult to step down later.

“Miaoyi, mourn in peace!” A greasy middle-aged man with a chubby appearance stepped forward, then continued, “Rest assured, with the old

Pavilion Master gone, my father and I will support you.”

He had a sinister smile..
