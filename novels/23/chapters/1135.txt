Chapter 1136: Golden Axe

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Red Lotus and Sunrise Sword Emperor hovered above Oblivion Palace.

“Give me the Red Source Stone,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said, beaming.

The corner of Red Lotus’ mouth twitched as she took out the stone with a wave of her hand and handed it to him.

“Did you already know that Jian Wushuang has exchanged for the Blaze Quicksand Gourd?” she asked, staring fixedly at him.

“Yes, and so do the other three Palace Masters.” Sunrise Sword Emperor smiled. “We all think that he has so much potential that he might be end up becoming the future leader of Green Fire Palace. We have been keeping an eye on him and naturally know what treasures he exchanged for in the Fire Points Exchange Office.”

“You, however, look down on him and wouldn’t be inclined to pay him any mind. Of course you wouldn’t know about that.”

Red Lotus snorted but did not rebut him. Instead, she said, “Blaze Quicksand Gourd is an extraordinary treasure. The only reason we sold it is that we have our unique treasures and have no use for it. I didn’t think he would exchange for it.”

“If I’m not mistaken, the gourd is worth over 200,000 Fire Points. He hasn’t even been in Green Fire Palace for long. Where did he get all those points?”

“Jian Wushuang obtained many Divine Soul Pills back when Dan Xin Palace came to the world. It’s more than enough to cover the cost of the gourd,” Sunrise Sword Emperor answered.

“Is that so?” Red Lotus nodded and then snorted again. “The kid sure is lucky.”

Then, her figure turned illusory and vanished.

Sunrise Sword Emperor followed suit shortly after.

Back in Green Fire Palace, Celestial Master Malignity had yet to return to his residence.

“Celestial Master Malignity!” A figure came chasing after him.

“Yes?” Malignity turned around. When he saw who it was, his expression relaxed.

“It’s you, Celestial Master Golden Axe. How may I help you?” he asked.

Golden Axe was a short and stout old man with a mellow face and amiable smile. He left a good expression on all those who met him for the first time.

Their relationship was decent. Thus, Malignity showed him a little more courtesy.

“Nothing much. I’m just curious about what happened in Oblivion Palace.” Golden Axe chuckled.

“Well…” Malignity frowned. He would not have been polite if some other Celestial Master asked him this but this was Golden Axe after all. He was a comrade that went through life and death with him on the huge battlefield.

“It’s a bit embarrassing. I wanted to teach Jian Wushuang a lesson but he’s stronger than expected. Moreover, he’s also equipped with a powerful treasure,” Malignity explained.

“Treasure? What is it?” Golden Axe asked.

“All I know is that it’s a golden gourd that pours out a massive amount of quicksand. It’s terrifying. The quicksand formed one sandstorm after another to attack me, preventing me from moving at full speed. That was how he gained the upper hand.”

Though he said that Jian Wushuang gained the upper hand, the truth was that Jian Wushuang had defeated him.

“I see.” Golden Axe frowned. “Celestial Master Malignity, the mirror token…”

“I’ve already told you that I didn’t use the mirror token,” Malignity said in a low and deep voice.

It was a lie, of course. He had used the mirror token since the very beginning and clearly recorded the course of the battle. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He would not have minded circulating the Mirror Image if it was an easy victory over Jian Wushuang. However, he would not be so stupid as to show scenes of his embarrassing defeat to others.

“I see. Then I shall ask no further,” Golden Axe said, face full of smiles.

Malignity nodded and took his leave.

Meanwhile, Golden Axe headed for Jian Wushuang’s mansion.

“My young friend Jian Wushuang, I’m Golden Axe. I’m here to visit you.”

Jian Wushuang had just returned to his mansion. His expression changed after hearing the old man’s booming voice.

“Golden Axe? Celestial Master Golden Axe?”

He knew some of the Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace. Naturally, he had heard of Golden Axe.

Golden Axe kept an incredibly low-profile. He was never one to flaunt or easily get into fights with other Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace.

Moreover, he was truly a good-natured, kind person.

Both his temper and public reputation was equally as good. Typically, he would not refuse requests from those in Green Fire Palace, be it lending Fire Points or researching Formations. Even if other Celestial Masters were in danger on the battlefield and asked for his help, he would also spare no effort in trying to rescue them even at the expense of his life.

If other Celestial Masters harmed his interests or wronged him, he would usually smile and let it go as long as it was not too serious an offense.

He was candid, loyal, and incredibly generous. Even though he was only an advanced Celestial Master, the others respected him greatly. They were all delighted to befriend him.

Hence, he enjoyed the greatest popularity in Green Fire Palace.

Jian Wushuang immediately came out to welcome Golden Axe when he learned that the latter was his guest.

“I’m Jian Wushuang. Nice to meet you, Celestial Master Golden Axe,” Jian Wushuang said humbly.

“Haha! My young friend, you’re too polite. You’re stronger than me. I don’t deserve such etiquette.” Golden Axe laughed amiably. “If you don’t mind, you can call me Golden Axe or Brother Golden Axe.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “Brother Golden Axe, please come in.”

He led Golden Axe into the mansion and the two of them sat down by a table. With a wave of his hand, he took out some fine wine and dishes.

“My young friend, I come to seek a friendship with you. I’m also curious about your battle with Celestial Master Malignity,” Golden Axe said.

“There was nothing important about the battle. I simply got lucky and gained the upper hand.” Jian Wushuang deflected the topic with a short and simple sentence.

“Oh?” Golden Axe asked no further. He began chatting with Jian Wushuang about the other matters in Green Fire Palace instead.

After drinking and chatting for half a day, Golden Axe Celestial Master finally stood up and was about to leave.
