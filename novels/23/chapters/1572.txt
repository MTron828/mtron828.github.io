Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Don’t worry. Although Duan Lingfeng’s current situation is terrible, his life is not in danger,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“That’s good,” Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and he calmed down immediately. He then asked: “Hall Master Yuan, what’s going on?”

“I am not sure of the details myself. However, Duan Lingfeng has indeed killed that core disciple of the Four Symbol Mansion in front of everyone. The Four Symbol Mansion is the overlord of the Four Symbol Land and its position is similar to the Lineage of Star’s in the Star Land. If the core disciples under them were unfortunate and killed while training in the outside world, they could only blame their disciples for being too weak and not anyone else. Hence, the Four Symbol Mansion would not go out of their way to kill the other party in order to avenge their core disciples.”

“For example, when Wu Bei’s cave appeared back then, many Universe Gods died. Among the Universe Gods who died, some of them were disciples of some big sects and big powerhouses. However, since they were killed by others in a fair competition for the White Blaze Fruits, the big sects and big powerhouses could not say anything.”

“But now, Duan Lingfeng has killed the core disciple of the Four Symbol Mansion under the nose of the Four Symbol Mansion in the Four Symbol Land. Due to this, the Four Symbol Mansion got furious and they immediately sent out experts under them to kill Duan Lingfeng. Fortunately, Duan Lingfeng himself is powerful and his ability to keep himself alive is quite decent as well. Hence, even though he was chased around by many experts, he still managed to escape to the Burning Demon Region.”

“Burning Demon Region?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“The Burning Demon Region was left behind by an Almighty a long time ago. Although many years have passed and many opportunities and treasures were plundered, many different kinds of seal still existed in the Burning Demon Region. There are both weak and powerful seals as well as seals that are useful for hiding. In any case, there are so many seals that it is uncountable.”

“After Duan Lingfeng escaped to the Burning Demon Region, he probably found a place to hide himself. For the past years, the experts of the Four Symbol Mansion have been searching for him in the Burning Demon Region. However, up till now, they were still unable to find him. Furthermore, the Four Symbol Mansion also posted an extravagant reward of a thousand-million Chaos Gems and this has attracted quite a number of Real Gods within the Four Symbol Land to join the search for Duan Lingfeng in the Burning Demon Region.”

“With so many experts looking, no matter how well Duan Lingfeng hides himself, he will be found by someone eventually,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

He could tell that although Duan Lingfeng himself was alright, his situation was very bad.

The moment his hiding place was found by someone, he would be besieged by a large number of experts from the Four Symbol Mansion. As a Universe God, no matter how strong Duan Lingfeng was, he would definitely be unable to stop so many experts.

“When the Lineage of Star obtained this piece of news previously, we acted immediately. After all, Duan Lingfeng is your good friend and he also gave you that White Blaze Fruit tree back then. The Lineage of Star owes him a favour and if we could help, we would naturally help.”

“However, that place is ultimately the Four Symbol Mansion’s territory. Hence, over there, the Lineage of Star is restricted in every sense and we cannot do anything at all. I have even sent Lei Chao over personally. However, Lei Chao could only stay at the edge of the Four Symbol Land. As soon as he makes a move to help Duan Lingfeng, his actions will definitely cause him to clash with the Four Symbol Mansion head-on immediately!”

“Even though Lei Chao is an expert in the Real God ranking list, confronting the Four Symbol Mansion within the Four Symbol Land head-on was too risky. As such, we did not do anything up till now,” Hall Master Yuan said.

After listening, Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

He also knew that the Lineage of Star had many scruples and he could understand.

“Jian Wushuang, the Lineage of Star is unable to take action openly in this matter. However, you are different. Duan Lingfeng and you are good friends in both life and death. Since everyone knows this clearly, it would be reasonable for you to take action. With this, the Four Symbol Mansion would be unable to put the blame on the Lineage of Star. Moreover, you have just cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven and your abilities have risen greatly. Therefore, you should be able to help Duan Lingfeng,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand. I will now head to the Four Symbol Land,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ok,” Hall Master Yuan also nodded his head and said: “Remember this. Although Duan Lingfeng is your good friend and you should rescue him, if there is really no choice, you must give up on him.”

“I will absolutely not give up on him,” Jian Wushuang shook his head without hesitation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even then, he still remembered the words that Duan Lingfeng had said back in Wu Bei’s cave when Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu and the rest of people came to kill him.

“From the start of my training until now, I do not have many friends. However, Jian Wushuang is one of them. If all of you want to kill him, then that is equivalent to wanting to kill me as well!”

Jian Wushuang had remembered his words thoroughly.

Although the situation back then had not reached the stage where he had no other alternative, Jian Wushuang was still touched.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Hall Master Yuan forced a smile and said immediately, “Alright. After you reach there, you should get in touch with Lei Chao. I have instructed him to wait outside the Burning Demon Region. If you really reach a stage where you have no choice, you can send a message to him and he will act straight away. No matter what, the Lineage of Star will not allow anything to happen to you even if we have to shed all pretence of cordiality with the Four Symbol Mansion and have a big fight with them.”

“Understood, thank you very much!” Jian Wushuang laughed with gratitude. However, he understood very well in his mind.

Sending a message to Lei Chao would be his last resort if he really had no other choice.

Unless necessary, he would not get the Lineage of Star involved.

Jian Wushuang increased his speed and headed for the Four Symbol Land at once.

After passing through the wormhole of the island, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Four Symbol Land.

After that, Jian Wushuang travelled at full speed. When he arrived at the edge of the Burning Demon Region, a month had passed.

Over the past month, Jian Wushuang also requested for Hall Master Yuan to relay information of the Burning Demon Region to him continuously.

It was really fortunate. The number of experts in the Burning Demon Region had increased over the past one month. However, until then, no one had managed to find Duan Lingfeng.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang took out Duan Lingfeng’s transmission token.

“Duan Lingfeng, tell me your current location,” Jian Wushuang sent a message straight away.

“Jian Wushuang? I heard that you have gone to a mystery land that many ordinary people live in. And now, you have come out of that mystery land?” Duan Lingfeng’s voice was still indifferent.

“That’s right, I have come out. Moreover, I am currently right outside the Burning Demon Region,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Burning Demon Region?” Duan Lingfeng’s voice turned gloomy, “What did you come here for?”

“You asked what I came here for?” Jian Wushuang said furiously, “Cut the crap and tell me your location quickly.”

After muttering to himself for some time, Duan Lingfeng sent his current location.

Jian Wushuang then took out the map of the Burning Demon Region that Hall Master Yuan had sent him.

The map had marked every corner of the Burning Demon Region. At the same time, it also included the locations of a number of seals. However, there were still a small number of seals in the Burning Demon Region that even the Lineage of Star did not know of.

In no time, Jian Wushuang found the place that Duan Lingfeng was at.
