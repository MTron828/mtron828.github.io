Chapter 1295: Result

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This little guy, sigh!”

The Master of Dayu Palace shook his head in silence, feeling utterly disappointed.

Wu Cang sat next to him and remained composed.

The time continued to fly past.

Just as the Master of Dayu Palace said, there was no suspense in the match.

Chu Xiao was stuck at the twenty-ninth move for three years and he finally resolved it. However, Universe God Qing Yang was already resolving the thirty-first move.

On the tenth year, which was the last year, Universe God Qing Yang resolved the thirty-second move while Chu Xiao only resolved the twenty-ninth move.

Ten years had finally passed.

“Stop.”

The Master of Dayu Palace said lightly. His voice was calm yet it spread magically.

In that instant, no matter if it were the two of them on the vacant lot or Jian Wushuang and the rest of the inner disciple from Dayu Palace in their respective secret rooms, everyone heard the voice simultaneously. At the same time, it broke off their connections with the Little Scattered Stars Game.

Everyone stopped.

On the vacant lot, Universe God Qing Yang let out a sigh of relief and stood up slowly.

As he stood up, the surrounding inner disciples from Dayu Palace looked embarrassed, especially Chu Xiao who was right beside him. Chu Xiao held his fists tight, his face was pale with rage.

He knew that he had lost badly in the match.

Universe God Qing Yang resolved a total of thirty-two moves in ten years time while he only resolved twenty-nine moves. There was a gap of three moves.

The gap was too wide!

“Considering the comprehension level, although Chu Xiao was slightly weaker than Universe God Qing Yang, he shouldn’t be so ridiculously behind. It was a pity that he was anxious.” The Master of Dayu Palace sighed and looked at Wu Cang who was next to him, “Wu Cang, you take a crucial role in the Snow Dojo and you have seen countless geniuses. What do you think about Universe God Qing Yang?”

The Master of Dayu Palace only asked Wu Cang what he thought of Universe God Qing Yang but he didn’t bring up Chu Xiao.

Obviously, he knew that Wu Cang wouldn’t put Chu Xiao in his eyes.

“Universe God Qing Yang?” Wu Cang’s eyes were cold as he stole a glance at Universe God Qing Yang who was the focus. He immediately replied, “So-so.”

“So-so?” The Master of Dayu Palace was shocked.

Universe God Qing Yang was widely recognized as the number one genius in Dayu World. Dayu World had not had a genius for a long time, but Wu Cang thought he was just so-so?

“From the Little Scattered Stars Game, one can see,” Wu Cang explained in a deep voice, “You and I know that there are four thresholds in the Little Scattered Stars Game. Every thirty-three moves is a threshold. As a Universe God in the First Heaven, to be able to resolve thirty-three move in ten years’ time and pass through the first threshold, then one could be considered as a real top genius. Such geniuses are popular in the Snow Dojo.”

“But Universe God Qing Yang only resolved thirty-two moves in ten years time and he only resolved the thirty-second move on the last year. His comprehension level couldn’t be considered genius. Of course, in the ordinary world, he is considered an impressive person. But in Snow Dojo, such genius wouldn’t even be in the top fifty.”

“Is that so? That’s a pity.” The Master of Dayu Palace let out a sigh, but he understood.

Dayu World was merely a normal world, which was really small. Snow Dojo was where the geniuses of Snow Kingdom gathered. Those who gathered there were the smartest and the most wicked Universe God Qing Yang was considered the top genius in Dayu World but he was just so-so in Snow Dojo.

“Dayu, actually, there really is a super genius in Dayu World.” Wu Cang suddenly said.

“Huh?” The Master of Dayu Palace looked at Wu Cang in surprise.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!” Wu Cang looked extremely solemn.

“Jian Wushuang, that boy is very impressive. He could kill a Universe God in the First Heaven when he was only a Universe Master. However, that only shows that his fighting power is strong. It couldn’t prove his talent and potential, right?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked as he creased his eyebrows.

“There’s no proof when one based solely on fighting power. The Little Scattered Stars Game aimed at testing one’s comprehension level. Hence, the Little Scattered Stars Game should show his talent, right?”

Wu Cang sounded very serious, “Dayu, you have been focusing on Chu Xiao from Dayu Palace and Universe Qing Yang so much that you didn’t pay any attention to Jian Wushuang. I am different from you. During the ten years, I have been observing Jian Wushuang in secret. I saw his every move in the secret room clearly.”

“Oh?” The Master of Dayu Palace lifted his eyebrows. He never thought Wu Cang would pay such attention to Jian Wushuang.

“Guess. After the ten years, which move did Jian Wushuang stop at in the Little Scattered Stars Game?” Wu Cang looked at the Master of Dayu Palace and asked.

“Still want to keep it a secret?” The Master of Dayu Palace smiled and answered, “The Little Scattered Stars Game was influenced by the environment. Under normal circumstances, a Universe God in the First Heaven could only be considered as a top genius if he resolves thirty-three moves in ten years. As for Universe Master, he has to at least resolve twenty moves to be considered as a top genius.”

“Did Jian Wushuang resolve twenty moves?”

“Twenty moves? No, more than that!” Wu Cang shook his head.

“More than twenty moves?” The Master of Dayu Palace looked surprised.

Resolving twenty moves was enough to be considered as a top genius and it was rare even in Snow Dojo for a genius to have resolved more than twenty moves…

“Wu Cang, quick, tell me. How many moves did he resolve?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked curiously.

Wu Cang didn’t continue to keep it a secret but took a deep breath before he announced, “Jian Wushuang wasn’t fast in resolving the moves at the beginning. But none of the moves in the later game seemed to hinder him much. It was smooth sailing for him!”

“In ten years, the Little Scattered Stars Game with a hundred moves, he resolved a total of thirty-five moves at the end!”

“What?” The Master of Dayu Palace’s eyes were wide opened in shock.

“How is that possible!!!”

The Master of Dayu Palace roared.

The roar shocked all the experts from Dayu Palace that had gathered on the vacant lot before Fairy Palace and they looked over in surprise.

They didn’t know what it was that had shocked their supreme Master of Dayu Palace to the point that he forgot himself.

“Huh?”

Universe God Qing Yang lifted his head and stole a glance at the Master of Dayu Palace.

“The result just came out after the ten years ended. The Master of Dayu Palace should be discussing the result with Lord Wu Cang who was next to him. Would it be that I surprised the Master of Dayu Palace when I resolved thirty-two moves within ten years?”

“That shouldn’t be. He saw when I resolved the thirty-second move. He didn’t respond much then.”

Universe God Qing Yang creased his eyebrows and his face grew strange.
