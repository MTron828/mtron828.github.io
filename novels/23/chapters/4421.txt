4423 Give Me Some Face

Within Great Sun Divine Kingdom.

A sword streaked across the sky, piercing through the sun and moon.

All the citizens who noticed this scene trembled and said in disbelief, “Did…did the King of Day lose just like that?”

“Jian Wushuang is too strong! His strength is far beyond that of a top Supreme martial artist!”

“Will the King of Day be the second top Supreme Master to be killed by Jian Wushuang after the master of Blood Sky Hall?”

Discussions broke out. Inside the great sun Palace, Great Sun Prince shuddered as he watched this scene.

“Fa…Father…”

His lips trembled. At this moment, he didn’t even have the courage to stop Jian Wushuang.

He and Jian Wushuang were both in the elementary Supreme realm, but only now did he understand how big the gap between them was!

Above the King of Day Palace.

The King of Day’s pupils shrunk as he looked at The Blue Sword that covered the entire sky.

He still had many trump cards that he had yet to use and many limit true treasures in his Interspatial Ring. However, at that moment, he was very sure that he would not be Jian Wushuang’s match even if he used all his skills!

Taking a deep breath, the King of Day lowered his head, looked at the palace, and shouted with all his strength, “Supreme Jade Cauldron, please lend me a hand!”

Buzzzzzz!

There was no response from the palace. It was as if a pause button had been pressed in the void. The mighty Blue sword light seemed to be caught by an invisible hand and could not fall.

“AI.”

A sigh was heard in the air.

A moment later, a Sage-like elder walked out of the palace. He was wearing a Daoist robe and holding a horsetail whisk, his silver hair tied up with a wooden hairpin.

Every step he took was in the void without using any power. It was as if the heavens and earth had laid a ladder for him and lifted him up.

“Disperse.”

He looked at Jian Wushuang indifferently without any emotion on his face. He just gently waved the horsetail whisk in his hand, and the star-slashing sword light that suppressed the world suddenly went away with the wind inch by inch like a sand painting, disappearing into the void.

“Ruler Jade Cauldron!”

The King of Day’s anger was slowly replaced by calmness. He stood behind Zhong Yue respectfully and saluted.

“I’ve been entrusted by others, and I’m loyal to them. Great Sun, leave it to me.”

Ruler Jade Cauldron nodded his head at him.

“Eh? And who are you?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He could feel that although Supreme Jade Cauldron looked plain and had an ordinary aura, upon closer inspection, he realized that he had already integrated with the great Dao of heaven and earth. His entire body was filled with the true meaning of the great Dao, but it was hidden.

In terms of strength, this man was much more terrifying than the King of Day. He was probably already at the half-step unparalleled Supreme realm.

“I’m Jade Cauldron. You may not have heard of my name since you’re young, but you can go back and ask the Blood Wave Supreme of your Divine Life Palace. He’ll naturally tell you who I am.”

Supreme Jade Cauldron’s expression was calm as he sized up Jian Wushuang. He then said, “Jian Wushuang, your talent is indeed outstanding. I heard that you were favored by the Lord Cosmos God during the gathering of all races in the universe. If it is possible, I do not wish to harm your life.”

After a pause, he said calmly, “Jian Wushuang, give me some face and let it go. Previously, you had all sorts of grudges with King of Day because you killed his son, the young Emperor. In addition, you were indeed weak back then and you had a powerful weapon. That’s why King of Day attacked you.”

“Since you’ve proven yourself to be a Ruler, we can naturally let bygones be bygones. I can make the decision on behalf of the great sun. As long as you back off now and never step foot in the Great Sun Divine Kingdom’s territory again, I will not pursue the matter of you humiliating him. How about it?”

Then, he looked at the King of Day and asked, “King of Day, do you have any objections to my decision?”

“I’ll follow your arrangements, Supreme Jade Cauldron,” the King of Day replied.

He had no desire to fight with Jian Wushuang anymore. He just wanted to get the God of killing to leave as soon as possible.

Supreme Jade Cauldron nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Jian Wushuang, are you going to give me face?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In his opinion, what Jian Wushuang needed was a way out. Now that he had given Jian Wushuang a way out, he was confident that Jian Wushuang would follow the way out.

After all, if he were to really take action, it would inevitably lead to the discussion of the strong bullying the weak in the universe. If he won, it would still be fine, after all, it was only natural. If he lost, his reputation as Supreme Jade Cauldron would be destroyed.

In Great Sun Divine Kingdom, countless people fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang’s face and waited for his answer.

“Your face?”

However, Jian Wushuang replied with a blank expression, “I’m sorry. I, Jian Wushuang, have never taken the initiative to bully others in my life. However, if someone bullies me, I will definitely take revenge and return the favor a hundred times over!

“Back then, the Great Sun Divine Kingdom slaughtered thousands of disciples of my Divine Life Palace, causing the death of many supreme beings. They even rewarded me with thousands of gold coins in the universe for my head. Now, you’re going to let this matter go just because you want to give you face?”

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang held the Tarot Divine Sword horizontally and pointed the tip of the sword at Supreme Jade Cauldron. He said coldly, “Let me tell you the truth. The King of Day is dead today. Even your Jade Cauldron can’t save him!

“If you know what’s good for you, then get out of my way and I’ll let you off. If you’re determined to protect him, then I’m sorry, I’ll kill both of us, let alone you!”

Audacious!!!

In an instant, Supreme Jade Cauldron’s face turned ashen, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

He, Jade Cauldron, was a half-step unparalleled Supreme-being, and no matter where he went, all the Overlords and giant arms would treat him with respect.

Jian Wushuang, a mere elementary Supreme, dared to humiliate him?

“You can try to see if I’m bold or not!”

Jian Wushuang looked at him coldly without any intention of backing down.

“Good, good, good. Jian Wushuang, since you don’t want face, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance!”

Ruler Jade Cauldron said in a cold voice. Then, he flicked his horsetail whisk, and his entire body turned into a stream of light. Like a wave of smoke, he rose up and rushed into the Nine Heavens.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll be waiting for you outside the star!”

...

Supreme Jade Cauldron’s cold voice rang out from the sky.

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and looked at Great Sun Divine Kingdom. If the two of them started a battle here, the entire star would be destroyed and thousands of people would die.

Every injustice had its perpetrator, and every debt had its debtor. This was not what he wanted.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang stomped his right foot and instantly gathered endless sword Qi. The last sharp and brilliant sword light shot up into the sky and beyond the stars.
