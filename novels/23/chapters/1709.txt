Chapter 1710: Damaged

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Psst! Psst!!

There were two rays of golden light. One ray went through His Highness Mu Hong’s chest and the other ray pierced through his head.

The power contained in the golden light instantly exterminated His Highness Mu Hong’s vigor.

His Highness Mu Hong stood there like a silly man but his consciousness had already dispersed.

Looking at the sight, the treacherous elders’, God Qi and God Ba’s, faces grew pale.

They knew clearly the identity of His Highness Mu Hong. They also knew of the terrifying existence behind his back.

At first, the mission that day was merely for His Highness Mu Hong to have some experience. Because of him, they had even dispatched three Sir God experts to safeguard him. On top of that, His Highness Mu Hong had had the war puppet too. There was in total four Sir Gods that safeguarded him, and His Highness Mu Hong was a Sir God himself.

With such a formation, theoretically, there shouldn’t be any accident.

But in the end, His Highness Mu Hong had died.

In front of them, he was killed.

“How dare you!”

“Jian Wushuang, just you wait. What happened today won’t end so easily!”

“For His Highness Mu Hong’s death, someone will look for you and take revenge!”

The treacherous elderly’s roar shook the earth while he brought His Highness Mu Hong’s dead body with him and ran away with the other two Sir Gods.

Jian Wushuang didn’t continue to chase after them but watched them leave.

The void finally quieted down again.

“Jian Wushuang, well done,” Sir God Mad Dog’s voice seemed a little surprised.

“Wushuang, very impressive,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

When the four Sir Gods had run away at the same time, although the two of them had tried their best, they couldn’t make any one of them stay back.

But Jian Wushuang had performed a great trick and killed one of them. The person seemed to be the most important person.

Jian Wushuang shook his head when he heard what they said.

“It’s a pity that my power is slightly weaker. If my comprehension towards any one of Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine were to break through and pass the seventh level of Doctrine Palace, or if I were to break through and become a stage three Ultimate Real God, I could make all of them stay back!”

“But, it’s good that I could make one stay. At least we didn’t let all them retreat in a complete troop,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Oh yeah, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning!” Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke.

Sir God Luo Sha’s face changed and she immediately plunged in the direction where the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was located.

Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog followed.

When they were near to the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, Sir God Luo Sha’s face grew pale but she immediately rushed into the divine pond.

Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog stayed in the void above the divine pond as they overlooked the sight below. The two of them looked awful too.

They could tell that the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was severely damaged.

Not only was more than half of the pond gone, an enormous amount of the Power of Absolute Beginning in the pond was vanishing into thin air as well. At that point, there was about thirty percent of the power gone and they continued to disperse.

“It’s due to the formation,” Sir God Mad Dog explained, “I heard from Sir God Sha Luo before that the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning developed and evolved from one drop of Power of Absolute Beginning. The evolution of Power of Absolute Beginning is carried out with a unique formation. However, a lot of the formations are damaged and even collapsed. The balance cycle of the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was interrupted. Not only did the evolvement slow, it was declining.”

“If she doesn’t repair the formation in time, the Power of Absolute Beginning will evaporate.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave when he heard that.

Very soon, Sir God Luo Sha plunged out of the divine pond.

“Sir God Luo Sha, how is it?” Sir God Mad Dog asked closely. At such a crucial moment, he didn’t have the mood to make a joke with Sir God Luo Sha and make fun of her by calling her old witch.

“A large amount of formations in the divine pond are damaged. Fortunately, the evolution formation merely shattered by half, so there’s a possibility to recover it. The core of the divine pond isn’t damaged either. I have temporarily steadied the divine pond so that the Power of Absolute Power won’t continue to evaporate. However, it is only for temporary. I have to immediately invite experts who are good at formations to come over to recover this,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

“The damage is so severe?” Sir God Mad Dog’s voice was low.

“I have to take the blame,” Jian Wushuang blamed himself, “The Sir God that I killed was important to me because he most likely knows the whereabouts of my wife. That’s why I didn’t want to kill him at first and only wanted to capture him alive. But I didn’t know…”

Jian Wushuang did feel very sorry.

Sir God Luo Sha didn’t need him to pay anything but let him absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. However, due to an unexpected incident, his selfish thought had led to the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning being very nearly ruined. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

One should know that if he were to kill His Highness Mu Hong right at the beginning with his skills, there wouldn’t be a scene where the divine pond was damaged.

“I can understand your feelings. I don’t blame you for what happened,” Sir God Luo Sha shook her head. She was an emotional person herself. Her husband’s death had driven her insane too.

Jian Wushuang had also turned irrational because of his wife.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang had never thought His Highness Mu Hong would have two God Destroying Pearls that were so powerful.

When he responded, it was already too late. He could only take revenge on His Highness Mu Hong and kill him.

“Jian Wushuang, originally, you could stay as long as you wanted in this divine pond, even until your divine power reached the ultimate achievement. But now… The divine pond is damaged and I have to get someone to fix it immediately. So, for quite a long time, there won’t be anyone who enters the divine pond. You will have to wait until the divine pond resumes its normal operation. In short, I can’t let you continue to absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

“I have gained a great harvest from the divine pond. I, Jian Wushuang, definitely won’t forget your favor. As for the rest of the accumulation of divine power, I’ll work hard on my own,” Jian Wushuang said.

Sir God Luo Sha nodded faintly.

“Oh yeah, you are so well hidden. Even in Sanctuary Alliance, there are less than ten people who know your whereabouts. How did the people find out where you are?” Sir God Mad Dog creased his eyebrows and asked.

“Who knows. Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace, humph, no one knows the tricks of those two hated parties. Luckily, the two of you happened to be here with me. Otherwise, with me alone, I’m afraid I couldn’t save the divine pond, nor would I still be alive,” Sir God Luo Sha humphed coldly.

“Sir God Luo Sha,” Sir God Mad Dog sounded very serious, “Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace found your location and locked their target at your the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. In the near future, you would definitely live in chaos. My advice to you is that you discuss with the few people from Sanctuary Alliance.”

Sir God Luo Sha squinted her eyes slightly when she heard that.
