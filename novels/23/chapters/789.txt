Chapter 790: The Star Map

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

But Purple Mountain and Bai Hu both cast their eyes on Xue Lingtian.

The two had already presented their gifts, which were both quite precious and useful to Jian Wushuang. Now, it was Xue Lingtian’s turn to present his gift.

Being the First Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian was the first one to join the Ancient Sect first among the four, and he was the most powerful as well. Besides, he was also one of the 18 masters of the Void Temple. Thus, his gift must be even more impressive.

“Junior Brother.”

Xue Lingtian spoke slowly. He took out a token and handed it over to Jian Wushuang. “This is my exclusive token. With it, whenever you go to the Void Temple to use a wormhole, you’ll only need to pay one-tenth of the normal price.”

“And, if you come across some danger in the journey or if some experts try to push you around, you can also show them this token. Then, they’ll know you have a special relationship with me. For my sake, they certainly won’t have a go at you.”

Jian Wushuang took the token. When he heard Xue Lingtian’s words, a rush of joy washed over him.

He was just thinking about asking Xue Lingtian for a token like this. But Xue Lingtian had given one to him on his own accord.

This token not only could help him use the wormholes of the Void Temple but also represent the identity of Darkblader Master. It might save his life in dire circumstances.

This token was absolutely priceless.

However, seeing Xue Lingtian only gave Jian Wushuang a token as a gift, Purple Mountain and Bai Hu pulled a long face.

Bai Hu said frankly, “First Senior Brother, you’ve given both Second Senior Brother and I a token like this. It’s only natural that our Junior Brother shall get one, too. But it’s a bit petty to present it as a gift at our first meeting, isn’t it?”

“Yeah, First Senior Brother, this token is not enough for this occasion,” Purple Mountain echoed.

“I know.” Xue Lingtian shrugged. “Since Master sent the message telling us we would have another Junior Brother, I’ve been preparing the gift for our first meeting. I have found a treasure, but that treasure is sort of unusual, and it takes some time to get. But, unexpectedly, Master summoned us to help our Junior Brother who was in danger, so I got here and met him earlier than expected.”

“Really? That explains it.” Purple Mountain and Bai Hu were convinced.

“Junior Brother, I’ll give you the gift when we meet next time. Or I can send a guy to deliver it to you. But now, I really can’t present it. Hope you don’t mind.” Xue Lingtian gave a wry smile.

“Sure. I am already very grateful that First Senior Brother has put so much effort into preparing my gift. I certainly don’t care if the delivery date is a bit late.” Jian Wushuang beamed.

“OK.” Xue Lingtian nodded slightly. “When I obtain the treasure in a few days, I’ll send it to you straight away. It will be quite helpful to you.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was quite looking forward to this gift.

“Junior Brother, have you got any plans for the near future? Are you going to stay inside the Ancient Sect?” Bai Hu suddenly turned to look at him and asked.

“In the near future…” Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment and shook his head. “I’ll go out for some adventures.”

“As expected.”

Bai Hu and the rest were not surprised at all at this.

“Well, the Firmament Territory is just a small parcel of land. Compared with the whole Eternal World, it is miserably limited. And there are only a few experts here. With your current battle strength, Junior Brother, you surely need to travel more and see the vast world,” Bai Hu said brightly.

Jian Wushuang smiled but did not reply.

Indeed, the Firmament Territory was rather small, and the number of experts here was also quite limited.

With his current battle strength, almost no one in this Firmament Territory was a match for him but the Dao Masters.

By this point, the Firmament Territory was no longer appealing to him.

Jian Wushuang was also aware that when an expert in Firmament Territory sect reached Step Four of the Eternal Realm, he would usually go to other places for adventures.

The three magnates, the Ancient Sect, and the rest of the top sects in the Firmament Territory had brought up many experts at or above Step Four. Some of them even reached Step Six of the Eternal Realm. But those Eternal Realm experts had long ago left the Firmament Territory. Few of them ever came back.

That was also the real reason why there were no Eternal Realm experts above Step Four in the Firmament Territory other than Xuan Yi.

“If Junior Brother is really going to visit places outside the Firmament Territory, I want to give you a Star Map that I believe will come in handy.” As he spoke, Xue Lingtian took out another token and handed it to Jian Wushuang. It contained geographic records of a vast domain.

Taking the token, Jian Wushuang’s mind raced. The view of a vast land instantly unscrolled before him. This land was so boundless that it was beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination. The Firmament Territory where he was staying merely took up an insignificant part of the whole region.

On this Star Map, there were innumerable territories similar to the Firmament Territory.

“How vast.” Jian Wushuang could not help but exclaim. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“First Senior Brother is one of the 18 masters of the Void Temple. And the most impressive thing about this Void Temple is that it has loads of wormholes that lead to every corner of the Eternal World. Thus, the Star Map you have received is the most complete and comprehensive map you can ever find. If you sell this Star Map in the market, the price shall be at least several million Divine Gems,” Bai Hu said excitedly.

“Thank you very much, First Senior Brother,” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

“You’re welcome.” Xue Lingtian smiled. “Junior Brother, the Star Map has brief introductions about all the marked places. Have a look and see which one you want to go to.”

Jian Wushuang started to examine this map at once. He looked through all the territories and soon fixed his eyes on an enormous region on the Star Map. There were no marked territories, but four big countries located in four directions. These four big countries took up nearly half of the whole Star Map.

“First Senior Brother, what are these four big countries?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“These are the four most powerful countries under control of my Void Temple. They are the Tang of the East, the West Paradise, the South Mountain Kingdom, and the North Sea Kingdom,” Xue Lingtian answered.

“Each of the four big countries has incredible foundation and strength.”

“Among the four big countries, the most special one is the Tang of the East!”

“Tang of the East?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly contracted.

The Tang of the East… Emperor Xiao, Di Jing, and Leng Rushuang were all from the Tang of the East.

Emperor Xiao even built up a Tang of the East in Jian Wushuang’s hometown, which was on the Nanyang Continent of the Ancient World.

Di Jing also mentioned the Prosperous Tang!

But there was still a lot about this Tang of the East that Jian Wushuang did not understand. For example, what were the true identities of Emperor Xiao and Leng Rushuang there? Why did they fall to an Ancient World? And what on earth was the Icy Heart Poison that once poisoned Leng Rushuang? And why did Leng Rushuang take off for no reason?

All these questions made Jian Wushuang long for a journey to the Tang of the East.
