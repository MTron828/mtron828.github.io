Chapter 2138 No Choice Lef

“What?”The confident red-haired elder Feng Wu was in shock.

The experts around had their mouths open wide in disbelief.

Feng Wu was a titan in the Peak Chaotic Realm. His attack had collided with the target and yet he was unharmed?

Even if the person had body armor, the force the slash contained would either get him severely wounded or cause the victim to fly back.

However, ‘Ancestor Hong Chen’ just stood there calmly, not moving.

He was not affected by the attack from Feng Wu?

“You, you…” Feng Wu looked at Jian Wushuang, dumbfounded.

“What? Do you think this is amazing?” Jian Wushuang smiled playfully.

When Feng Wu saw that expression, a dawn of realisation hit him.

“No that’s not right. Even another expert in Peak Chaotic Realm would be forced back when hit by my attack. No one within the Three Emperors World has this terrifying Self defence mechanism!”

“I have only seen one person in my entire life reach that stage!”

Feng Wu widened his eyes as he stared at Jian Wushuang and roared, “You are definitely not Ancestor Hong Chen and you are definitely not in Middle Stage Chaotic Realm!!”

“Ha!” Jian Wushuang smiled sheepishly and revealed his true form.

At that instant, an aura even more terrifying than Feng Wu’s erupted and swept out in all directions.

This aura made every expert tremble to their core.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s appearance changed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was originally a stubborn elder man in red clothes. Now, he looked completely different.

He looked younger, firmer and colder.

Once the face had appeared, Feng Wu felt his head was about to explode.

“It is you! Of course it is you!”

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

A loud howl reverberated in the sky.

This terrible howl pierced through the air and shocked everyone.

Not just Feng Wu, who was dumbfounded, but Ling Tianhao, who was standing not too far away, was also shocked.

A fear like never before manifested in his heart.

“Devil! It’s the Devil!!!”

“The Devil is back!!”

Ling Tianhao screamed crazily.

“Devil?”

The surrounding experts were stunned, and then the uproar began.

Only one person had been called the Devil in all of Three Emperors World history.

That person was the man that had stood up to thirteen titans in the Chaotic Realm, destroyed the Supreme Emperor Stone, and left alive!

In everyone’s mind, this person was the strongest, most undefeatable and unkillable Devil!!

And this Devil was now here?

“Haha. Looks like my name is well known in the Three Emperors World.” Jian Wushuang saw the facial expressions of the experts around and smiled.

Feng Wu, who stood in front of Jian Wushuang, was fearful for his own life and retreated quickly.

He wanted to escape as he knew for a fact that there was no way he could beat Jian Wushuang.

It was a pity that Jian Wushuang had other plans for him.

“Don’t be so anxious to leave.”

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly as he waved his hands.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Seven figures appeared in the space around Jian Wushuang.

When the seven figures appeared, seven overbearing auras of Peak Chaotic Realm swept out.

Any one of these seven auras made Feng Wu fear for his own life.

“Oh no!!”

Feng Wu turned pale and ran without hesitation.

The seven experts who came out from the Blood Mountain Sword attacked.

All seven of these great emperors targeted Feng Wu.

Most importantly, every single expert was much stronger than Feng Wu.

Feng Wu stood no chance against the seven men.

Boom!

After a loud bang, his corpse fell to the ground.

There was a hole in his head and chest area. His life dissipated instantly without a trace.

“I thought that great emperors were very powerful and it would take a great amount of effort to kill one. Looks like it is easy to kill one if the person is powerful enough or many great emperors ally together.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he looked at the crowd.

“Everyone, let us start the massacre!”

Once Jian Wushuang finished his sentence, the seven great emperors moved.

Boom~~~

Overbearing aura mixed with a heavy killing intent erupted.

The seven great emperors split up and they attacked.

There were a great number of experts around the three statues. Initially, there were around a thousand Chaotic Realm experts meditating there. Following the commotion, many experts were drawn over and there were over one thousand five hundred experts now.

They were simply in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm and the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. No matter how many of them there were, there was nothing they could do unless they formed up in a battle formation. Against the seven great emperors, they had no chance.

“No! No!!”

“Run! Escape!!”

“The Devil brought some titans from the Peak Chaotic Realm? Run!’

Miserable shouts and cries could be heard everywhere.

The experts in the Chaotic Realm had no courage to try and withstand the attacks. They simply ran.

However, their speeds were no match for great emperors such as the Abysmal Saint Master. The seven great emperors slaughtered a great number of experts from the Chaotic Realm.

Around the three statues was an area for meditation. Within seconds, it had turned into Asura Hell.

In the middle of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang stood there calmly. Ling Tianhao and the teenage girl in green clothes stood in front of him.

These two stared at Jian Wushuang, terrified.

“Devil, Devil!!!” Ling Tianhao roared as fear rose from the bottom of his heart.

Jian Wushuang looked at Ling Tianhao coldly as he slashed his sword. Two sword lights shot out instantly.

Ling Tianhao and the teenage girl were killed by the two sword lights. They could not even put up a fight.

“Do not blame me for being merciless. I have no choice!” Jian Wushuang mutterred.
