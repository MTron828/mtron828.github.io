4792 The Destruction of the Sand Demon Cave

An indescribably terrifying astral wind swept across.

Immediately after, Monk Jian Qing said in a deep voice, “Kong Tong, Senior Brother Kong Ji, there’s no need to waste time talking to her. Just destroy this place and we’ll definitely find Senior Brother Konglun.”

The two people, who were called Kong Tong and Kong Ji, did not speak. They were clearly waiting for Sha Qing’s reply.

There was only mockery in her eyes. “I’ve said it before. Konglun lost to me. His life and death are in my hands. Do you think that you can save him by destroying my Sand Demon Cave? What a joke!”

“Since you’re so stubborn, then use your life to atone for your sins,” the two monks put their palms together and said in a deep voice.

In an instant, the clear light of Buddha pierced the sky and projected onto the land where evil thoughts were born.

All the evil cultivators who were in a state of excitement and madness exploded into puffs of blood mist and disappeared.

Jian Wushuang saw it clearly. Almost at the moment when the indiscriminate Buddhist light shone down, he directly released a vast derivation power, which turned into a barrier above the three people.

Cui Jing was already scared out of his wits. There was no way he could survive under the light of Buddha.

Then, he saw Jian Wushuang and the other two people not far away. He immediately twisted his body and rolled forward.

“Three warriors… Quickly save me!” Cui Jing said hysterically.

“This kid is really lucky!” Cheng Qing was surprised.

Jian Wushuang did not look sideways, but he reached out his hand and led Cui Jing over.

Although he did not have a good impression of Cui Jing, who looked like a gangster and was definitely not a good person, he still extended a helping hand.

This was because Cui Jing had not made things difficult for them in the past few years. They had lived together in peace.

“Many, many thanks.” He nodded at Jian Wushuang to express his gratitude and then let out a long breath.

The Buddha’s light that attacked indiscriminately descended, and everything in the Sand Demon Cave was destroyed!

The chaotic city, the tall city walls, and the sand-covered ground were all turned into dust.

“Woof! Buzzzzzz!”

The Buddha light swept across the magic barrier above his head. Jian Wushuang groaned and a drop of divine blood dripped from his nose.

When Chen Qing and Chunqiu saw this, they hurriedly released Yan power together to completely stabilize the barrier.

“This bunch of f*cking bald donkeys! They’re going to be exterminated!” Cheng Qing’s face was red. He had not fully recovered and was clearly struggling.

Wiping off the divine blood, Jian Wushuang looked at the broken sky with a serious expression.

Under the light of Buddha, Sha Qing did not dodge or avoid it. She allowed the light of Buddha to shine on her body and pierce through it.

She was seeking death!

Even Jian Qing and the others, who hated her to the core, were stunned by this situation.

She put her hands behind her back and did not resist at all. In fact, she seemed to be relieved.

When the light of Buddha that shone on the ground dissipated, the entire Sand Demon Cave was destroyed and collapsed.

Kong Tong, Kong Ji, and the other 11 monks all stared at the tottering figure.

The blood-red straw cape was torn apart by the wind. There was almost no part of Sha Qing’s body that was intact. Divine blood that could not be dispersed flowed from her body.

“Female Demon, quickly tell me where my Senior Brother Konglun is!” Jian Qing shouted.

Sha Qing’s pupils, which were gradually dissipating, gathered together again. She glanced at him, then slowly turned around and tottered to the ground.

“You have guts!” Jian Qing shouted and raised his hand to crush her.

“Jian Qing.” Kong Ji, who had not said a word before, looked at him and warned him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Monk Jian Qing took a step back and retracted his palm, but his eyes were still filled with dissatisfaction.

Kong Tong and Kong Ji did not attack again. They put their hands together and looked forward.

Divine blood dripped onto the barrier, and Sha Qing, whose body had been shattered, fell directly to the broken ground.

Cui Jing gritted his teeth and his eyes turned red. “Sister, why didn’t you leave?”

She was already an arrow at the end of its flight. She then looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Hey, I’m going to die.” As she spoke, she did not have the slightest awareness that she was on the verge of death. She even raised her eyebrows.

Then, with her broken palm, she took out a bunch of bloody objects from her bosom and threw them at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did to take it, but in the end, he could not bear it and reached out to take it.

The Blood Qi was restrained, and it was a palm-sized Crystal Skull.

“Don’t give this to anyone until you reach the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm. As compensation, I will give you all of my comprehension.” Sha Qing could not stand still, but she still stood up and walked toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt a sense of crisis. He glanced at the monks in the broken sky and said calmly, “If you want me to leave alive, don’t come near me from now on, and don’t give me your comprehension.”

When Sha Qing heard this, she was stunned for a moment before she laughed listlessly. “That’s right. You’re a supreme existence. How could you be interested in my comprehension?”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly, not understanding what she meant.

“You guys can go. I’ll stay back to open the way for you,” her eyes gradually regained their vigor, as if she was burning her Immortal Source.

Jian Wushuang did not stay any longer. He immediately turned around and prepared to leave.

“No, I’m not leaving. I’ll stay with you,” Cui Jing said as he shook his head desperately, but his movements were restricted by the chains on his body.

“Don’t follow me anymore. In the future, we’ll be far apart and we won’t meet again,” Sha Qing turned around and said in a cold voice.

“My Lord, if you really don’t want to go to the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm, please pass the thing I entrusted you to Cui Jing and let him go.”

After saying this last sentence, her originally broken body instantly condensed. Countless strands of dignified Blood Qi surged out of her body, covering the sky and the sun.

Jian Wushuang paused for a moment before he continued to move forward.

“Let me go, I’m not leaving…” Cui Jing tried to twist his body, but Jian Wushuang knocked him out with a palm knife.

Chen Qing and Chun Qiu also knew the urgency of the situation. They immediately grabbed Cui Jing and flew out.

“Where do you think you’re going?” The two monks, Kong Tong and Kong Ji, launched an attack at the same time, raining down punishment on them.

The indescribable terrifying Yan power was like a Heavenly River, falling down with the intention of annihilating Jian Wushuang and the others.

“Hey, Monk, you killed without distinguishing right from wrong. What’s the difference between you and me?”

In the boundless blood mist, Sha Qing’s body exuded a strange and dense crimson red.

Jian Qing’s eyes narrowed. “Not good, Senior Brother. She’s going to shatter the Immortal Source!”

As his voice fell, the dark sky was completely torn apart. A huge amount of Blood Qi devoured and minced everything.

A Yan Immortal’s shattered Immortal Source was the final blow, enough to destroy an entire Heavenly Region.

This was also the first time Jian Wushuang had seen Yan immortal’s shattered Immortal Source after entering the Great Yan Domain. The terrifying energy produced almost swept them all in.
