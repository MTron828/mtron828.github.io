“Twenty-four sounds?”

“This person actually sounded the Beast King Drum twenty-four times?”

“His Ancient God Power is so thick and rich. Moreover, his Bloodline is definitely extremely pure.”

The Ancient Gods around the area were exclaiming with admiration.

It should be known that the golden-haired youth, who was the strongest among them, had only managed to sound the drum twenty-one times.

In addition, it would get even harder to sound the Beast King Drum the more times it was sounded.

“Where did this person come from? Why have I not heard of him before?” the golden-haired youth frowned.

Even the indifferent man who was hosting the assessment glanced at Jian Wushuang and smiled at him, “Not bad.”

Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

In a split second, the second assessment was over.

Anyone who had managed to sound the Beast King Drum at least sixteen times would be able to enter the third assessment.

With that, the Ancient Gods in the assessment were reduced by more than half. In the end, only ten Ancient Gods remained for the third assessment.

Amidst these ten Ancient Gods, the most dazzling person was naturally Jian Wushuang, followed by the golden-haired youth.

“We shall rest for two days so that all of you can recover your Ancient God Power. The third assessment shall begin two days later,” the indifferent man said.

The ten remaining Ancient Gods then started to recover their Ancient God Power immediately. After all, they had exhausted all their Ancient God Power to sound the Beast King Drum moments ago.

Under normal circumstances, the Ancient Gods would definitely be unable to recover their Ancient God Power fully in two days’ time. However, the Ancient Gods present were top Five-star Ancient Gods who had cleared the Ancient God Test of the Third Heaven. Hence, they had been recognized by the Plenilune. By relying on the Plenilune inside their bodies to recover their power, they would definitely be able to achieve their peak within two days, or even less than two days.

At the same time when they were recovering their Ancient God Power, the golden-haired youth came beside Jian Wushuang.

“I am Gu Zhen and I am under King Gu Yi,” the golden-haired youth introduced himself.

“Gu Jian and I am under King Gu Tong,” Jian Wushuang said.

“King Gu Tong?” the golden-haired youth revealed a surprised expression, “You are a clansman of King Gu Tong?”

“That’s right. Is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang said.

“No problem. It’s just that I did not expect that among the clansmen of King Gu Tong, there would actually still be an outstanding clansman like you,” Gu Zhen gasped with admiration.

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He could tell that the clansmen of King Gu Tong who he had mentioned seemed to be in a bad situation.

“It’s really impressive that you are able to sound the Beast King Drum twenty-four times. Among the Five-star Ancient Gods in the whole Gu King City, there are probably very few people who can compete with you. However, sounding the Beast King Drum merely requires the richness and thickness of the Ancient God Power as well as the purity of the Bloodline; it is not really affected by our own fighting capabilities,” Gu Zhen stared at Jian Wushuang.

“If nothing goes wrong, the third assessment later on should be actual combat. If there is an opportunity then, let’s have a fair competition!”

Gu Zhen’s eyes were filled with excitement and there was a fighting intent hidden deep inside his eyes.

It was obvious that he did not feel that he was not as outstanding as Jian Wushuang.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head while laughing.

Two days’ time passed by in a flash. Everyone had made a full recovery and they were at their peaks.

The eyes of the indifferent man who was hosting the assessment looked around the surrounding and his voice was extremely loud, “The third assessment is actual combat, and your opponent is over there…”

Under the guidance of the indifferent man, the participants saw a few Ancient Gods carrying a giant iron cage together and they were walking toward the martial arts training ground. Upon arriving at the martial arts training ground, the Ancient Gods removed the black cloth on the cage and revealed the three humongous animals within the cage.

For the three humongous animals, each of them was at least a hundred feet tall. Moreover, their entire bodies were filled with pitch-black hair and they looked like giant apes. However, they had a total of four arms and every arm was unusually thick.

“These are Undying Demon Apes,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head, “I did not expect the Ancient God Palace of the Gu King City to actually use Undying Demon Apes as your opponents for the assessment. This is going to be interesting.”

The indifferent man at the center of the martial arts training ground continued to speak: “All of you will take turns to fight against these three Undying Demon Apes. You have ten breaths’ time. As long as you are able to defeat these three Undying Demon Apes within this time limit, you will pass this assessment.”

“Now, the first…”

One Ancient God walked up immediately and in no time, he started to fight against the three Undying Demon Apes.

As soon as they fought, Jian Wushuang could tell that although the three Undying Demon Apes had extremely big physiques, their abilities were not strong and they were similar to top Universe Gods. However, when the three Undying Demon Apes unleashed their powers, they would at most be slightly stronger than a top Universe God of the Third Heaven of the human beings.

Moreover, the three Undying Demon Apes had never touched the Power of Heaven Way before. Hence, their close-quarters combat techniques were sloppy.

“The Undying Demon Ape is a weak clan, right? Compared to other special clans, it seems to be a lot weaker,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re wrong. The Undying Demon Ape is not a weak clan. On the contrary, it is a top clan. Within the Ancient God Sanctuary, apart from the Ancient God Clan, there are the eight top clans which are considered the strongest. As for the eight top clans, the Undying Demon Ape Clan is one of them,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Top clan? Even though they are clearly not strong?” Jian Wushuang said with surprise.

“Indeed, they are not strong. However, they possess special abilities. Just wait and see,” the King of Venomous Worms laughed.

Jian Wushuang observed thoroughly. At that very moment, the Ancient God in the battlefield struck the head of an Undying Demon Ape with a very big fist of his fiercely and his unreasonable strength smashed the head of the Undying Demon Ape straight away. Under normal circumstances, when the head was smashed, the being would be completely dead. However, after some time, the head of the Undying Demon Ape regenerated.”

“This is…” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide, “The Undying Demon Ape. Could it be that they have the ability to not die?”

“Not die? That’s not true. Jian Wushuang, as an Inverse Cultivator, back then when you were at the stage of Eternal Realm, wasn’t the ability that you possessed immortality as well? Although the special ability of the Undying Demon Ape is slightly inferior to your immortality, it is still very close to it. Thus, if you want to kill an Undying Demon Ape, unless you use a great technique to annihilate its body completely, otherwise it will regenerate quickly,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed with admiration.

He finally knew why the Undying Demon Apes were known as one of the top clans. Their “undying” ability was really a bit too frightening.

With such an ability, the three Undying Demon Apes which were top Universe Gods would be fine as long as they did not come across experts that were at the level of top Void Real Gods and above. However, if a normal Void Real God were to come across the Undying Demon Apes, it would be very difficult for the Void Real God to kill them. Since the Undying Demon Apes’ ability to remain alive was so strong, they would continue to multiply and their numbers would naturally increase. As they continued to grow, they would be able to become a top clan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Ten breaths’ time is up!”

The indifferent man who was hosting the assessment shouted. With that, the battle stopped straight away and the Ancient God who fought first walked down with his face filled with bitterness.
