Chapter 2366: Elder Token

Water Fairy Tower was the foundation of the Water Fairy Island.

It contained countless secret skills and other secrets.

Jian Wushuang walked up to the door of the Water Fairy Tower. There, a lady in red clothes sat crossed legged. As Jian Wushuang approached, the lady in red clothes remained still. Jian Wushuang ignored her as she walked into the Water Fairy Tower.

On the first floor of the Water Fairy Tower, there were countless jade bamboo strips found lying around everywhere. Jian Wushuang picked up a few and scanned through them quickly.

“The secret skills found on the first floor of the Water Fairy Tower are of too low level. They are similar to those secret skills that the Lin Mansion has. They are of no use to me.”

Jian Wushuang put back the secret skills after scanning them briefly.

Jian Wushuang then proceeded to the second floor.

The secret skills found within the second floor were obviously of a much higher level as compared to those found on the first floor. Secret skills of this caliber were abundant within the Water Fairy Tower, but would be extremely rare in the families and clans.

As for the secret skills found on the third level, Jian Wushuang considered them exquisite.

There were: blade skills, sword skills, spear skills, and many others. They were created by powerful Chaotic Divine Demons and were incredibly powerful.

Jian Wushuang felt that it was worth spending time on some of these sword skills.

If Jian Wushuang was really an ordinary Outer Disciple, he would pick a few sword skills related to Spacetime Rules of Order or Reincarnation Rules of Order and study them.

However, he was not an ordinary Outer Disciple.

He did not stop here for long as he headed straight for the fourth floor.

Before he stepped foot onto the steps leading to the fourth floor, the eyes of the lady sitting in front of the Water Fairy Tower opened her eyes. She appeared almost instantly in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Stop!”

The lady in red clothes glared at Jian Wushuang and said coldly, “Brat, I can sense your disciple token on you. You are a mere Outer Disciple. You should know the rules of the Water Fairy Tower: an Outer disciple can only visit the first three floors and is not allowed onto the higher floors. You must become a core disciple before you can enter.”

“I know the rules. Even though I am not a core disciple, I have this.....” Jian Wushuang took out the Elder Token given to him by Elder Wu Jian.

“Elder Token? As an Outer Disciple, you possessed the Elder Token? Who gave it to you?” The lady in red clothes looked surprised.

“Elder Wu Jian gave it to me personally. If you do not trust me, you can go and clarify with him.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The lady in red clothes frowned.

“I have the Elder Token, so can I enter the fourth and fifth floor? I believe that I can pick any secret skills of my choice, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at the lady in red clothes and said.

The lady hesitated for a brief moment before she stepped aside and said, “Proceed.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang thanked her as he headed up towards the fourth floor of the Water Fairy Tower.

Jian Wushuang went up the fourth floor, leaving the lady in red clothes confused.

“Elder Nine gave his Elder Token to an Outer Disciple? What is going on?”

“I have to ask.”

The lady in red clothes took out a transmission token.

“Elder Seven, something happened.”

The lady in red clothes told Elder Seven about her encounter with Jian Wushuang.

Within the mountain range that Elders from the Water Fairy Island lived in.

“An Outer Disciple has an Elder Token?”

“Nonsense!!!”

In the dark, a figure in a black cloak stood up.

This figure belonged to a skinny elder who had a sharp vision.

“What is Wu Jian doing?”

He cursed as he went to the garden which Wu Jian lived in.

“Wu Jian.”

The elder in black went straight for Wu Jian.

“Elder Seven? What happened?” Wu Jian looked at Elder Seven and said coldly.

Even though they were both Elders in the Elder Group, they always fight.

Wu Jian, as Elder Nine, did not get along well with Elder Seven, hence they always fight over small matters.

Of course, they never actually fought in combat, but quarrel often.

“Wu Jian, I heard you just returned and brought back another disciple?” Elder Seven looked at Wu Jian and asked.

“Yes.” Wu Jian said as he drank a mouthful of tea.

“What is his name? And how talented is he?” Elder Seven asked.

“His name is Jian Wushuang, and he is very talented.” Wu Jian said.

“Oh? So he became a core disciple?” Elder Seven asked again.

“Nope. He is an Outer Disciple. He wanted to be an Outer Disciple. Given how talented he is, he can become a core disciple easily.” Wu Jian said honestly.

Hearing this, Elder Seven was enraged, “Bastard. As Elder Nine in the Elder Group, you are one of the most powerful men in the Water Fairy Island. You went out for so long and you only brought back an ordinary disciple? And you even gave him your Elder Token? Wu Jian, you are messing around!!!”

“Messing around? Maniac Jin, watch your mouth.” Wu Jian looked at him darkly. He even changed the way he addressed him.

Few from the Water Fairy Island knew that Elder Seven was also known as Maniac Jin.

It was obvious that Wu Jian was extremely displeased at what Elder Seven just said.

“Watch my mouth? Why is Jian Wushuang an Outer Disciple and not a core disciple? Everyone knows that a core disciple receives much better treatment as compared to an outer disciple. If he is really talented, why wouldn’t he try his best to become a core disciple? Instead, he chose to be an outer disciple. This meant that he is not capable and cannot pass the test to become a core disciple. This means that you brought back an ordinary disciple!”

“And Elder Token. Everyone in the Elder Group only has one Elder Token, and you gave it to an outer disciple. If you are not messing around, then what are you doing?” Elder Seven roared in anger.

“Maniac Jin, I will say this again. Jian Wushuang is not an ordinary disciple. He is a true genius, someone much more talented than anyone you have seen before. Even if he is an ordinary disciple, that Elder Token belongs to me. I can give it to anyone I want and there is nothing you can do about it.” Wu Jian stood up and said coldly.
