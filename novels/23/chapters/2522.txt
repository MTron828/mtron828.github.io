Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Oh, what a change of tone?”

Jian Wushuang’s lips curled up as his face laced with a jesting expression. “Are you threatening me with the seventeen other prefectures? Well, let’s give it a go!”

“Give it a go?”

The Demonic Moon Prefecture experts glowered, but Jian Wushuang made his first move before their eyes!

Rumbling...

The infinite golden divine powers poured on the people and oppressed them.

In an instant, each of their experts was suppressed by a domain-like force.

“Sh*t!”

“Is this a domain restriction? How can it be so powerful?”

“Damn it! He’s about to wipe us out!”

The experts were shocked and desperately looking for an escape path.

Governor screamed frantically. “Stop, stop! The other seventeen prefectures will surely take revenge on you!”

Jian Wushuang was unruffled.

His majestic sword intent swept across the area as 11 apparitions appeared at the same time which went in for the kill!

Before his First-Class Divine Demon breakthrough, Jian Wushuang was already able to take out a few Ultimate Gods. However, his performance was completely incomparable after the breakthrough. Under the Golden Prison and domain suppression, those people of Demonic Moon Prefectures had no way to escape.

A series of forbidding sword shadows constantly flickered in the Golden Prison. Its ever-changing flickering styles sent heads flying and bodies falling with each flicker. There were many within the Demonic Moon Prefecture who were not weak in strength or combat prowess, but they were unable to deflect Jian Wushuang’s attacks.

“No!”

“Come on! Let’s attack him together!”

“Run! Run!”

Shrill and howling of every kind came from each corner but they were drowned by the Golden Prison’s walls.

A quarter of an hour had passed when the world finally calmed down.

Xiao Tiexin was standing on the edge of the Golden Prison with shock and horror in her eyes as she stared at everything in front of her.

“They are dead. All the bandits in Demonic Moon Prefecture including the Governor are dead!” Xiao Tiexin’s heart quivered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Demonic Moon Prefecture, one of the Eighteen Prefectures in Dark Thunder Territory was not only infamous within the Dark Thunder Territory but also in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory.

Besides, the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s overall strength was strong as they had one High-Level Ultimate God, eight Primary-Level Ultimate Gods, and thousands of Divine Demons which many were either Peak Divine Demons or First-Class Divine Demons.

Such a lineup was stronger than many overlords or sects in the world.

The Great Compassion Sect which was the top sect in Wusha Wilderness only had one High-Level Ultimate God and three Primary-Level Ultimate Gods which was inferior to Demonic Moon Prefecture. However, Jian Wushuang alone extirpated the Demonic Moon Prefecture.

The Demonic Moon Prefecture was destroyed.

Neither their bandits nor higher-ups like their governor could escape the Golden Prison and Jian Wushuang’s attacks.

All of them were killed.

Rumbling...

The Golden Prison enveloping the prefecture soon faded away.

The huge Demonic Moon Prefecture appeared once again under the sun, but bloody scenes and bodies were strewn across the area.

Jian Wushuang scoured the bones, collecting Interspatial Rings and treasures which were left behind.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin left an hour later.

...

Jian Wushuang had already counted the various resources and treasures he had collected from the Demonic Moon Prefecture in the void.

“Not bad, I’ve gained twenty-nine thousand Primordial Stones after extirpating the Demonic Moon Prefecture on top of various valuable resources and treasures.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

Jian Wushuang definitely gained a huge wealth as 29,000 Primordial Stones equated to 290,000,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power.

Adding up the rest of the resources and treasures, the value was much higher than the twenty-nine thousand Primordial Stones.

In other words, the resources accumulated by the Demonic Moon Prefecture over the years were valued at more than 80,000 Primordial Stones.

80,000!

It was a frighteningly high number.

“This is just the wealth from one of the Eighteen Prefectures. Imagine if we obtained all the wealth from those Eighteen Prefectures. Although these Eighteen Prefectures are great, they are still a far cry from affluent families in the Northern Darkstar Continent. Just like your Xiao clan at its peak.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Xiao Tiexin beside him.

The Xiao clan where Xiao Tiexin came from was one of the biggest clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent at its peak. Their influence was only second to the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

For Xiao Tiexin to receive a total of 6,000 Primordial Stones just from her mother’s collection. The entire wealth accumulation by the Xiao clan must be of a startling amount!

“Tiexin, these six thousand Primordial Stones yours.” Jian Wushuang took out 6,000 Primordial Stones and returned them to Xiao Tiexin.

Xiao Tiexin gladly accepted it. She knew Jian Wushuang had just made a fortune after destroying the Demonic Moon Prefecture, so 6,000 Primordial Stones were nothing to him.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I’m sure news of the fallen of Demonic Moon Prefectures will spread throughout Dark Thunder Territory. The seventeen other prefectures will definitely soon receive news of this. Though the Eighteen Prefectures are always competing against each other, they are united against a common enemy. I’m sure the other seventeen prefectures will come after to kill you soon. We better leave the Dark Thunder Territory now,” suggested Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “No, don’t worry about it. The Demonic Moon Prefecture has just been destroyed, it takes time for the other prefectures to react after getting the news. We can take advantage of this time to accumulate more wealth.”

“Accumulate more wealth?” Xiao Tiexin was startled as she looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment. “Mr. Jian Yi, are you thinking of extirpating the other prefectures too?”

Jian Wushuang smiled. “Haha, smart. My plan isn’t as simple as merely wiping out the Demonic Moon Prefecture. Now that I’ve already done something to one of the Eighteen Prefectures, I don’t mind doing it on another one. Why don’t I seize this opportunity to exterminate a few more prefectures and reap more benefits?”

Xiao Tiexin was in a daze before she said, “Mr. Jian Yi, you are talking about the Eighteen Prefectures. They are no ordinary small fries. Each of them has a formidable background and is extremely powerful. The Demonic Moon Prefecture is ranked rock-bottom among the Eighteen Prefectures. You are definitely powerful to be able to destroy it but you should just stop right here.”

“Demonic Moon Prefecture ranked rock-bottom among the Eighteen Prefectures?” Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised but immediately cracked a smile. “Tiexin, your Xueya Escort Team often roams the Dark Thunder Territory. You should know the Eighteen Prefectures much better than me. We are now in the central area, can you tell me which prefecture is closest to the Demonic Moon Prefecture?”

“Heaven Poison Prefecture!” Xiao Tiexin said.

“Then let’s go to the Heaven Poison Prefecture. We can talk more on our way there,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.
