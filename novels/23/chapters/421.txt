Chapter 422: Two Days!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As one of the most highly valued cave mansions in Pale Moon Marquis’ camp, the place was not only protected by a powerful Formation externally but also by several experts internally at all times. However, these experts were mostly mediocre, and only two of them were any outstanding.

One of them was He Yunchong, while the other was the bald elder Elder He. They were both Stage Three experts.

He Yunchong, of course, turned out to be a mole deployed by Drifting-blood Marquis, while Elder He had just been murdered by the former. Consequently, there remained only a bunch of Stage Two experts.

They, too, had detected the changes which had taken place to the Formation.

“What’s going on?”

“The Formation is actually breaking?”

“It’s He Yunchong. He killed Elder He and has now destroyed the Array Core of the Formation.”

“Dammit. I can’t believe He Yunchong is a spy.”

“Quick, send word to the campsite!”

A commotion kicked off throughout Jiushe Cave Mansion. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

These Stage Two experts, who served under Pale Moon Marquis, would turn pale in shock when the Formation was completely broken and Jian Wushuang and co. appeared in front of them.

“I’ve killed the only Stage Three expert in here. The rest are just Stage Twos. They carry no threat to us,” He Yunchong said.

“Move!”

Bone King issued a terse order before transforming himself into a beam of flowing light which shot forth with a terrifying vigor.

Jian Wushuang and co. followed up without hesitation.

“Block them!”

Pale Moon Marquis’ experts were able to put up a resistance at first. However, they lost their courage after Bone King charged at them and, with a casual slap, turned several of them into smithereens.

“Run!”

“Fast!”

“Oh gosh. We can’t fend them off at all without the Formation.”

Pale Moon Marquis’ Stage Two experts began to flee disorderedly. Various figures were seen scampering in all directions.

“Kill!” Bone King’s killing intent was soaring.

“Haha. These all count as battle achievements.” Beast laughed maniacally.

Only Jian Wushuang and Xue Yang did not act.

Xue Yang’s temperament was laid-back, and he had no interest in killing people who were merely Stage Two experts of the Saint Realm.

As for Jian Wushuang, even though he was innately battle-hungry, he never enjoyed slaying the weak.

The entire Jiushe Cave Mansion quietened down after only a short while.

Save for a very small handful who fortunately escaped, most of Pale Moon Marquis’ experts, who had been guarding the cave mansion, were ruthlessly massacred.

Under He Yunchong’s lead, Jian Wushuang and co. arrived in the secret chamber where the Array Core had been.

“Lady Red, how long will it take you to fix up a Formation?” Bone King enquired.

Lady Red looked around the place with a heavy face before replying, “The floor area of this cave mansion is extremely large. It’ll be rather tedious for me to fix up a Formation. It should take at least two days to complete.”

“Two days?” Bone King frowned slightly. “The news of us capturing Jiushe Cave Mansion will spread very quickly to Pale Moon Marquis’ camp. That should take a day at most by their usual speed. A fresh group of experts will then come to kill us.”

Pale Moon Marquis’ camp valued Jiushe Cave Mansion greatly. Many of the experts who were guarding it possessed a “messaging slip” which could send word to the Marquis in a short time. In fact, the camp already received news when Jian Wushuang and co. had just started to capture the cave mansion.

And knowing Pale Moon Marquis’ speed, he was very well able to organize a group of experts to come killing within a day.

“But, most of the experts of Pale Moon Marquis’ camp are out and about in the Flaming Battlefield, and not many are left in the camp. Even if the camp can deploy experts within a day, there shouldn’t be too many of them. At most, it will be a small team that comes. We just have to think of a way to fend off such a small team,” Bone King noted.

“Understood.”

Jian Wushuang and co. nodded their heads, albeit their expressions remained somewhat solemn.

They all understood that in this mission, capturing Jiushe Cave Mansion was not the hard part. The real difficulty was in fending off the counteroffensive from Pale Moon Marquis’s camp.

Only that was the most difficult and dangerous part.

“Lady Red, you shall go and fix up the Formation first. As for the rest, go and have a look around the cave mansion while the Marquis’ experts are not yet here. Who knows what you might find. After all, people from the Marquis’ camp need to amass 8000 battle achievements before they are granted a single trip here.” Bone King spoke once more.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang laughed involuntarily.

Every cave mansion in the Flaming Battlefield possessed its own unique opportunities. Furthermore, the cave mansions controlled by the two large camps required unique battle achievements as payment for a single visit. For instance, even the most average cave mansions under Drifting-blood Marquis required the expenditure of between 2000 to 3000 battle achievements for a single visit.

And for a cave mansion on Jiushe’s level under Pale Moon Marquis, 8000 battle achievements were required for a single visit.

This meant that the cave mansion was considered to be among the highest level, and was only secondary to the Marquis’ personal cave mansions.

Besides, the owner of Jiushe Cave Mansion, known as Jiushe Lord, was a Sword Principle expert. Jian Wushuang was desirous of some of the opportunities which the former had left behind on several Sword Principles in the cave mansion.

Jian Wushuang, Xue Yang, Beast, He Yunchong, and co. began to look around the cave mansion without hesitation.

“He Yunchong, you have been guarding Jiushe Cave Mansion for a long time. Haven’t you looked around the place before?” Beast questioned.

“Although I was guarding the place, I stayed only in the outer layer. The inner layer, where the opportunities are, was off limits.” He Yunchong revealed a forced smile before he continued. “I know exactly which opportunities there are in this cave mansion, however.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang shot a glance at He Yunchong.

“Follow me.” The latter walked upfront and led the way.

As Jian Wushuang and co. were capturing Jiushe Cave Mansion, things were happening far away in Pale Moon Marquis’ camp, which was situated at the edge of Flaming Battlefield.

In the middle of a huge tent were three thrones, upon which three people were seated.

These three people each had an abnormally terrifying aura. They were way above the level of the Saint Realm, and were apparently three lord-level super beings.

However, their expressions were rather hideous at present.

Several experts were standing deferentially in front of them.

“We have just received news that Jiushe Cave Mansion has been captured by experts from the enemy camp!”

The leader among the three lords was a burly middle-aged man with purple hair. His thunderous voice began to sound within the tent.

Causing the hearts of the Stage Three experts standing in front of him to shudder involuntarily.
