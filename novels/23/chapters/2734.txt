Chapter 2735: Oppression

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The four of you want to fight me?” Saber Master’s cold gaze swept across Jian Wushuang and the other three Grand Ultimate Gods as a terrifying breath of aura started brewing in his body.

It felt like he was far more powerful than the average High-level Grand Ultimate Gods such that both Hong Chen and Long Xianzi felt inferior.

Jian Wushuang and the other three were in a stand-off against Saber Master.

Even though it was four against one, the four of them were aware of Saber Master’s much stronger strength when compared to the average High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

In that case, the four of them might have a slim chance of winning against Saber Master by teaming up.

“Be careful and don’t be careless,” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen reminded the other three.

“Of course, look what I’ve received.” Long Xianzi’s eyes narrowed before flipped her hand to reveal a bronze mirror.

The bronze mirror started to be filled with a faint golden mist in which Long Xianzi then pointed her finger.

Buzz!

The bronze mirror was emitting fulgurant golden lights.

Each stream of the golden lights was extremely dazzling and bright. The countless light streams then started to come together densely at an astonishing speed.

In the blink of an eye, those golden light rays filled the surrounding void and superimposed each other to instantly form a Golden Light Domain.

“Domain Oppression!”

Long Xianzi announced in a thunderous voice as the Golden Light Domain unleashed a powerful force against Saber Master.

Saber Master quivered slightly with a strange luster flashed in his eyes. “A Domain Treasure? Judging from its power, this must be a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure! Long Xianzi, you’ve got a great gift from this secret realm.”

Long Xianzi merely smiled faintly.

Ordinary Heavenly Treasures served no purpose to Heaven Ultimate God or Grand Ultimate God cultivators.

Even a High-level Heavenly Treasure was nothing in the eyes of Grand Ultimate Gods.

On the other hand, Pinnacle Heavenly Treasures were rather precious.

An Offensive Divine Weapon Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure would attract the attention of ordinary Grand Ultimate Gods whereas a Defensive Armor Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure was coveted by many Grand Ultimate Gods. Long Xianzi had taken out a very special Doman Treasure Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure!

A Domain Treasure was much more precious than a defensive armor.

Long Xianzi’s bronze mirror’s value was extraordinary. It was impossible for a High-level Grand Ultimate God such as herself to possess such a valuable treasure under normal circumstances. She was likely to have gotten that treasure from the secret realm.

Each of them received an Interspatial Ring when they first arrived at the ancient castle in which it came with previous treasures. For instance, Jian Wushuang had gotten five Huangji Golden Pill.

The four of them except Jian Wushuang were at the secret realm 50 years ago and had also received an Interspatial Ring each.

In other words, Long Xianzi had at least two treasures with the bronze mirror being one of them.

“The treasure is good, but your divine power is mediocre. The domain oppression won’t have much effect on me.” Saber Master’s voice was cold. His breath of aura had weakened but not by a lot despite under the Golden Light Domain’s oppression—his breath of aura was still rather strong nonetheless.

Jian Wushuang took a step forward.

“Long Xianzi, let me help you.”

A majestic golden divine power surged behind Jian Wushuang while Jian Wushuang spoke. In the blink of an eye, a 10,000-foot-tall Golden Emperor was formed behind him.

The Golden Emperor wore golden armor that looked intimidating as though it ruled over everything beneath him.

Jian Wushuang then pointed his finger.

Whoosh!

The golden divine power sea hit with strong propelling force.

Although the golden divine power sea came like a tidal wave, it did not hit the Golden Light Domain but instead overlapped with the Golden Light Domain under Jian Wushuang’s careful control and instantly conjured a huge Golden Prison within Heaven and Earth with the golden lights enshrouded the Golden Prison.

Golden Light Domain and Prison of Punishment—the double domain oppression had superimposed.

Jian Wushuang’s Divine God of Punishment had reached a height of 10,000 feet—it was the technique’s third level. The Prison of Punishment was being displayed once again with its power being much stronger than before as it came with even more impressive domain oppression.

Saber Master’s face sank under the pressure of the double domain oppression that was building up over his body that in turn increased the oppression acting on him.

“A Domain Secret Technique? Haha, not bad! Is there any more?” Saber Master jeered.

“There is of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently before his sword intent rose to the heavens as he displayed his 100,000 mile Sword World.

“Principle World?” Saber Master smiled contemptuously as he too discharged saber intent and formed a terrifying Principle World.

The two Principle Worlds collided.

It was only a matter of seconds when... Swoosh! The Principle World conjured by Saber Master was completely crushed, shrunk, and eventually collapsed.

Saber Master was horrified. “What? Both of us performed a complete Principle World. In addition, I achieved my Complete Principal World much earlier than him so my principle world should be more stable. Why did it crash when mine collided with his?”

“How incredible is his Principle World?”

Saber Master had no idea that Jian Wushuang’s Principle World was at 100,000 miles.

Jian Wushuang was the only person who could perform that level of strength.

The horrifying Principle World could suppress much higher leveled opponents. For example, Jian Wushuang’s Principle World could already suppress Profound Sword Worlds while still at the Merit level. Jian Wushuang and Saber Master both had Complete Principal World and stood at similar levels. However, he could easily defeat Saber Master’s Principle World when Jian Wushuang displayed a small portion of his power.

After Saber Master’s Principle World had collapsed, Jian Wushuang’s Sword World started oppressing Saber Master.

It was equivalent to Saber Master being triple-oppressed at the moment. The triple-oppression power was extremely powerful such that Saber Master showed a twisted expression as he struggled to ward off the oppression.

Saber Master was powerful indeed. However, his strength was weakened to a very low level under the triple oppression.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had conserved his power as he was capable of performing a fourth suppression which was the extremely powerful Star Armor Domain of the Nine Sparkle Star Armor, but he did nothing as such.

Hong Chen and Devilish Wind King who were in the void had noticed the tremendous oppression Saber Master had been subjected to and were overjoyed.

“Alliance Master Su Han, good work.” Long Xianzi glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s great.” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen added. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Saber Master can only probably exert less than seventy percent of his usual powers. You guys can go ahead.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
