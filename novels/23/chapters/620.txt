Chapter 621: Killing with abandon

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When the first round of the genius battle began, rampant killing immediately broke out. Numerous people were gathered outside the battlefield.

These people each had a Jade Slip and were quickly taking notes.

In front of them, there was a huge screen which displayed thousands of small images. These images showed what the Skyscraping Realm experts in the Ancient World were doing on the battlefield.

This screen was called the Mirror Image. It was a unique technique that could be used to record any scene in any place.

That meant that all the fighting taking place could be shown clearly in the Mirror Image.

“Number 69 image, the bald man with a Battle Axe.”

The voice was emotionless.

Everyone turned their attention to the image. With his battle axe, a bald man cleaved two Skyscraping Realm who were attacking him. The two men died instantaneously. The axe did not lose its momentum as its continued its progress towards a Majestic Mountain and split it into two parts.

“He has comprehended the Earth Dao and created a higher level of advanced Secret Skill. Great comprehension. He passes the first round!”

“Mark it immediately!”

“Number 177 image, the burly middle-aged man in a thick armor.”

In the Number 177 image, the man raised his sword-shaped eyebrows and stared at the 20 people in front of him.

“My name is Feng! ”

In a cold voice, the man hacked with his saber.

The saber produced a blade light that went unerringly to its target like a rolling river.

The blade light suffused the battlefield and immediately killed four Skyscraping Realm experts. The burly middle-aged man then flew through the battlefield and killed the remaining two people within two breaths.

“Genius Feng has already comprehended the Destruction Dao. It also seems that he has totally figured out the first Occult and created the higher level of the advanced Secret Skill. He is qualified to enter the second round. Mark it!”

“Number 19 image, the black-robed youth with a longsword.”

Instantly, all people focused on the Number 19 image and saw Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

With terrifying killing intent, the sword light rushed forward and killed 13 Skyscraping Realm experts in a couple minutes.

“Good comprehension of the Slaughter Dao and his swordsmanship is extremely strong. So far we don’t know which level of the Secret Skill he has created, so he will be confirmed later!”

The cold voice spoke without pause and his pronouncements were all continuously recorded in the Jade Slip.

Thousands of fights were occurring simultaneously on the vast battlefield, all of which could be observed using the Mirror Image. When any expert displayed an amazing strength, the action would be immediately recorded and he would be judged for second round qualification.

The fights in the battlefield for geniuses in the Eternal World were recorded too.

As long as the warriors displayed impressive strength on the battlefield, they wouldn’t be ignored.

...

Swoosh!

A figure rushed through the crowd with a sword light suffused with terrifying killing intent.

This sword light with tremendous power easily outclassed three Skyscraping Realm experts. It killed them instantly and sent them out of the battlefield. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“So strong!”

There were still four people nearby and they all looked at the black-robed youth in terror.

The black-robed youth was Jian Wushuang.

After three years of earnest cultivation, Jian Wushuang had significantly improved his strength. His comprehension of Dao and Secret Skill were both much better than an ordinary Skyscraping Realm. Even Dark Emperor and Wu Xin would be easily killed by him. He would only need to use Slaughter Body to defeat these Skyscraping Realm who hadn’t created any Secret Skills.

Few people would catch Jian Wushuang’s attention and he would dispatch the rest with ease.

It was very difficult for him to meet an expert whose strength was comparable to his. That was why he could easily kill all his opponents here.

“Go to hell!”

Once again, Jian Wushuang started the attack and immediately sent another four people out of the battlefield.

“Continue the killing!”

Jian Wushuang looked grave as he continued to fight.

On the battlefield, the killing continued at increasing levels of aggression.

Everyone knew that passing the first round depended on their strength. Since they all had tokens to protect themselves, no one was worried about dying and went all out to kill their opponents.

Soon, three days had passed.

During this time, most of the Skyscraping Realm had been weeded out. Only a few people remained on the battlefield.

There was no doubt that survivors after the three days were the real experts!

All of them possessed a good comprehension of Dao and almost everyone had created their own Secret Skill. They were really much stronger than the ordinary Skyscraping Realm experts.

On the plain, Jian Wushuang slowly walked forward and glanced around him.

Occasionally, he would see an opponent and kill him immediately.

In these three days, strong experts had emerged and were now recognized by others on the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was at the top so it was reasonable to rank him in the top 30. Many people would know of his reputation and chose to run when they saw him.

“Already three days, when on earth will the first round will be over?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The first round had no rules, so they had to keep killing their opponents, but he didn’t know when it would be over.

Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped and raised his head. A red-robed woman had flown from the hill in front of him and was slowly walking towards him.

She held a scarlet scythe and was filled with Killing Intent. She looked at him with a hint of excitement.
