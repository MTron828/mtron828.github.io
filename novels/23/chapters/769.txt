Chapter 770: The Best Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang barely managed to withstand Yun Fan’s Sound Wave Attack using his own body.

But at the same time, Yun Fan swung his long staff and hurled it at Jian Wushuang.

“Secret Skill, Heaven Anthem!”

Buzz~~~ A miserable voice started echoing throughout the place all of a sudden.

It sounded like music of lament.

While the music sounded, a towering Stone Staff furiously streaked across the sky along a straight route.

Jian Wushuang used his whole body and mind to block off the Sound Wave Attack. He had just regained his composure when he was just about to get struck by the staff. He had no time to defend himself with his sword, let alone time to dodge.

“Secret Skill, Mind-controlling Secret Skill!”

A strange power surged suddenly and covered Yun Fan.

This strange power was felt like a sharp stinger stabbing him inside his head.

“What?”

Yun Fan felt a sharp pain. Although he could hold it in, it had slowed his movements.?

Jian Wushuang took advantage of the situation and went to the other side. At the same time, he struck out his Emperor Sword mercilessly.

“Get lost!”

He shouted. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Funny.”

Yun Fan sneered. He moved his wrist and held up his staff swiftly to meet Jian Wushuang’s sword.

Yun Fan had just managed to block the attack before Jian Wushuang started to unleash his swordsmanship.

Boom! Boom!

The two were soon in an intense battle.

At first, they fought on the ground, leaving the land and the forest in ruins.

Later, they moved their battlefield to the void, causing the sky to tremble and shake. A limitless amount of energy was thrown about in the sky, forming a wild wind.

Following which, they came back to the ground again.

It was a fierce battle!

It was a battle like none before.

The onlookers had retreated to another place to stay away from the two fighters since long ago.

Many of the experts in the crowd, including the disciples who were only at the Divine Realm expert level, all had a dull look as they watched the fight.

It was so amazing!

It was definitely the most intense, crazy and fierce fight they had ever seen.

The two showcased an array of tricks. After such a long fight, there was still no winner.

Most importantly, one of them, Yu Fan, was an Eternal Realm expert ranked second in Firmament Territory and had the fourth step of battle strength.

And the other was just a Divine Realm expert?

The astonishment was especially so among the disciples in the crowd.

“Is Jian Wushuang really just a Divine Realm expert?”

“I never thought that a Divine Realm expert can be so powerful.”

“I heard that even the most powerful Divine Realm expert could only be a match only for the weakest Eternal Realm expert, but now, it seems…”

“With his current power, although he is just a Divine Realm expert, Jian Wushuang could kill an ordinary Eternal Realm expert like he was killing a goose.”

They were all Divine Realm experts, but the power demonstrated by Jian Wushuang was beyond those disciples’ imaginations.

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would never believe it.

On the battlefield, the two finally widened the gap between them again.

Yun Fan was standing still in the Void. His gaze showed that he no longer took his opponent lightly. Instead, there was a serious look that was not there before.

“This boy…

“I’ve tried my best, but I still cannot gain a bit of upper hand.”

“How could he be as powerful as me when he is just a Divine Realm expert?”

Yun Fan was astonished.?

If someone had told him before this that there was a Divine Realm expert who as powerful as him, he would laugh and even disdain the person. However, now he knew that it was indeed possible. Jian Wushuang’s ability was nowhere weaker than his.

“Not only is he not weaker than me, but he also has plenty of Spiritual Power.” Yun Fan narrowed his eyes.

His battle with Jian Wushuang was so crazy; he used every single trick that he knew. That would definitely be a toll on Spiritual Power.

For an expert of Eternal Realm like him, his Spiritual Power was already depleted by more than 30%. Jian Wushuang was just a Divine Realm expert, he should have exhausted all his Spiritual Power after such an intense fight. But in reality, he was still at the peak of his condition.

“Although I do not know why he has so much Spiritual Power, it is very obvious that I cannot win him by suppressing him with mine. Since that’s the case, I can only do this.” Yun Fan’s face darkened and he lifted up his head.

“Jian Wushuang, you are really something else!”

“You’re just a Divine Realm expert but you’re the most powerful one I’ve ever heard.

“Prepare to take my best move then.”

As he spoke, a fiery red energy kept surged out of Yun Fan’s body.

“Your best move?” Jian Wushuang looked indifferent and had a faint shine in his eyes. “I am looking forward.”

“The best move?”

Upon hearing Yun Fan’s words, the onlookers all turned towards Yun Fan.

They were looking forward to it as well.

“I’ve never displayed this move in front of others ever since I became the Great Elder of our sect. Boy, you should feel proud for making me do this. Also, don’t worry. In the end, I will control my power and not kill you.”

Yun Fan’s voice echoed again, full of confidence. He raised his staff high up above him.

A large amount of fiery red energy surged wildly while it covered the whole Void, as if it was a fire in the sky spreading gradually.

Jian Wushuang felt scorching hot, as if he was in a sea of fire.

Yun Fan was standing in the center of the fire, as if he was the king of fire.

With a wave of his hand, the fire disappeared, leaving behind a red staff shadow that was protruding out.

“Four-Beast Secret Skill, Burning Dragon!” Yun Fan snarled.

“Roar!”

A loud roar echoed throughout the place. Jian Wushuang widened his eyes only to see a Burning Dragon coming straight at him. A giant Burning Dragon appeared where the staff shadow pointed to.

The dragon was about 10,000 feet long and was covered in fire. It seemed to be able to destroy everything.

It growled lowly as it neared Jian Wushuang in raging fires.

The onlookers could not help but to tremble with fear at the scene.

“This move is so… formidable!”

A few Eternal Realm experts started murmuring.

Many experts present shared his feeling.
