Chapter 1263: The Last City

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang, Lin Dong, Mo You, the three Divine Generals, and the sergeants of the Seventh Army were gathered in the void outside the Red Water City.

They all surveyed the giant city in front of them.

“Red Water City is the last city still controlled by the Red Water Alliance, whose headquarters is also in this city. Lord had led many Universe Gods to wipe off all the experts of the alliance in this city before, however, as we conquered other cities of the alliance, the refugees all escaped to this city. It looks that they want to have a final fight with us here,” Mo You said with a smile.

“The last fight? hump, it will be futile.” Lin Dong snorted.

“Guys, do you think whether the Young Master of the Red Water Alliance is in this city or not?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

It had been three months since they worked together, plus that Jian Wushuang had gained Lin Dong’s and Mo You’s recognition, the relationship between the three was closer than before.

“Are you referring to Gu Nan?”

Lin Dong looked over with a cold smile on the corner of his mouth. “The last time when Lord attacked this city, Gu Nan was lucky. He was not in the city; otherwise, he would have been killed. Now, the Red Water Alliance is going to fall, and his title as the Young Master exists in name only. If I were him, I would have fled away to other regions. Waiting here is just courting for death.”

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

Not being a fool, Gu Nan should have left the city if he did not have absolute confidence in winning the battle, because he was just a normal Invincible Universe Master who had a duty to revive the Red Water Alliance.

“Well, let’s stop talking and get into the city to kill all the remaining experts of the Red Water Alliance. Complete this mission, and we can have a celebration party after we return back.” Lin Dong smiled when speaking.

“The Seventh Army, let’s fight!”

Jian Wushuang immediately ordered the soldiers of the Seventh Army.

Taking the order, the soldiers immediately swarmed into the city.

“Jian Wushuang, this is the last battle in our mission. Are you going to practice your skill as before?” Mo You asked Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Well…” Jian Wushuang showed an embarrassed smile and replied, “I’ll decide when I meet a proper opponent!”

Mo You and Lin Dong looked at each other, smiling, wordless.

Have been staying with Jian Wushuang for three months, they knew how crazy Jian Wushuang was about cultivating.

Yes, crazy!

During the last three months, they had experienced many battles as they conquered cities of the Red Water Alliance one after another, and normally, because there had been none Invincible Universe Masters among their opponents, they, as Divine Generals, could have stood by and watched the soldiers fight. However, Jian Wushuang could not hold his fight intent and had joined soldiers to fight.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had not tried to overpower those Universe Masters and Holy Masters of their rival camp as Lin Dong and Mo You had expected; he had restrained his power while fighting with his opponents to practice his swordsmanship.

All the opponents Jian Wushuang had picked were the experts with excellent fighting skills and brilliant moves, and some of them even had impressed him much.

During that period, Jian Wushuang had over a hundred fights, and each of them was not ended until he thought he had practiced enough.

He could have killed those opponents easily, but as if he was making fun of them, he had restrained his power all the time.

At first, Lin Dong and Mo You was confused by his actions.

However, as Jian Wushuang had fought more and more, they figured out his intention.

Jian Wushuang had been trying to practice his swordsmanship, not making fun of his opponents.

No matter how weak his opponents were, Jian Wushuang seized every opportunity to train himself with those people.

“He is crazy!”

“Yes, a crazy man who won’t?let go of any chance to improve his power!”

The longer Lin Dong and Mo You had been with Jian Wushuang, the more they thought that Jian Wushuang’s power was not as simple as they could see.

They started taking this young Divine General who had just left his hometown and cultivated less than ten thousand years even more seriously.

As they stayed outside the city with Jian Wushuang, suddenly…

“Scarlet Island!!! ”

A loud roar resounded throughout the city like a thunder, shaking the place.

Then, a young man wearing a luxurious golden robe rushed out of the city with a group of experts of the Red Water Alliance following him.

“He is…”

“Gu Nan?”

“The Young Master of the Red Water Alliance?”

Jian Wushuang, Lin Dong, and Mo You all looked surprised seeing the young man.

They had just thought that this Young Master could not be in the city, but now…

“Haha, this Young Master is courting death.” Lin Dong immediately laughed.

“Is him so stupid?” Jian Wushuang was amused.

“Let’s go to meet with this young leader.” Mo You also smiled.

The three Divine Generals all rushed into the Red Water City.

When the three entered the city, Jian Wushuang’s expression slightly changed.

“Guys, I’m afraid we are in trouble,” he suddenly said.

“In trouble? Why?” Lin Dong and Mo You looked confused.

Jian Wushuang did not explain to them further. His Soul Power had targeted an aura hidden deep beneath them.

The owner of the aura had hidden very well that Lin Dong and Mo You could not sense him, but it was hard to cheat Jian Wushuang, who had Soul Fire.

“Are the three of you the Divine Generals of the Scarlet Island?”

The voice of anger came from the Young Master Gu Nan, who came up to the three Divine Generals, eyes full of hatred.

“Gu Nan, you know that we will come here to kill you. It’s courageous of you not to escape.” Lin Dong’s voice sounded cold as well. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Escape?” Gu Nan said with a sneer, “Yes, I am going to escape, to somewhere beyond your reach, even somewhere out of the Dayu Region. But before that, I have to kill the three of you to have the Scarlet Island pay for what they have done to our alliance.”

“Kill us three? On your own?” Lin Dong looked disdainful.

Right then, with the Soul Power, Jian Wushuang felt that the aura hidden in the ground rose up sharply.
