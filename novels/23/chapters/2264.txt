Chapter 2265 Bing Shan

Leng Ruxue stood very close to Heaven’s Horizon.This was so that she could enter the passageway immediately when it finally opened.

This instant would pass very quickly. Even though Leng Ruxue had become the leader of the Holocust Sect, she had never done anything at all, even during the battle back in the Three Emperors World. No one knew how powerful she really was or what kinds of techniques she had up her sleeves.

She seemed much more terrifying as no one knew anything about her.

If Leng Ruxue really had incredible techniques, she could appear within the passageway without giving Jian Wushuang a chance to react at all.

Jian Wushuang would not risk that, so he decided to stop her immediately!

He would suppress Leng Ruxue in front of all of the experts from the ancient past!

This was the safest method.

However, there were great difficulties that he would face by using this method.

Jian Wushuang took two steps and appeared in front of Leng Ruxue.

He stared at Leng Ruxue coldly, not speaking a word.

The experts from the ancient past looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Jian Wushuang. It has really been a long time since we last met. Are you still not going to give up?” Leng Ruxue fixed her gaze on Jian Wushuang as she teased him slowly.

“Ten thousand years ago, I could not have stopped you from leaving the Green Fire World. However, I will not allow the same thing to happen twice. I will stop you from leaving this Heaven and Earth at all costs,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“At all costs? Even if it costs your life?” Leng Ruxue teased again.

“Even if it costs my life,” Jian Wushuang said firmly.

“Haha. You really are infatuated with her. I do not understand which part of her has attracted you so much that you will do anything for her,” Leng Ruxue smiled.

“Heartless people like you will not understand these emotions,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that the case? Well, I am excited to see how you will stop me from leaving.” Leng Ruxue smiled. She turned to the well-built man beside her and said, “Lord Bing Shan, sorry to trouble you but I need your help.”

“Okay.” Bing Shan nodded his head.

After he’d awakened, he had received a direct order from that man from the Absolute Beginning Divine World, which was to escort Leng Ruxue back to the Absolute Beginning Divine World safely.

Bing Shan would give his all because of the person who had given the order.

“You are the Sword Emperor?”

Bing Shan took a step as his giant body blocked Leng Ruxue out of sight.

“I know that you and Palace Master Leng were friends in the past. However, I suggest that you forget the idea of saving her, or simply forget her altogether. Then you will not have to die and can continue to be one of the most powerful men in this Heaven and Earth and live your life as you wish. If you persist in trying to stop her from leaving... Trust me, my lord can kill you even though there are Restrictions on Heaven and Earth!”

“Is that the case? Sadly, I am a stubborn person. If I make up my mind to do something, I will definitely get it done no matter who gets in my way. Even if your lord were to come into this Heaven and Earth and stand in front of me, I would not give up.” Jian Wushuang smiled mockingly.

“You really are a stubborn man. If you wish to die so badly, then I will send you on your way.” Bing Shan’s face turned cold as he spoke.

He then whipped out a green battle-axe and held it in his hand.

He did not radiate any blade essence. Bing Shan simply stood there, but there were waves of invisible aura spreading in all directions as the surrounding area turned frosty.

The freezing space and the freezing air turned into blades as it started to cut experts. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Lord Bing Shan is about to attack!”

“This Jian Wushuang really has courage. He dares to stand up against Lord Bing Shan!”

“Lord Bing Shan is one step away from being a Master of Holy Land. Even though he is under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, his fighting power is still much stronger compared to experts like Old Monster Jiao.”

“The Sword Emperor is overestimating himself. Does he think that after killing some Divine Demons and Old Monster Jiao together with Emperor Bai he is now invincible in this Heaven and Earth? He has yet to meet experts like Lord Bing Shan. Now that Lord Bing Shan is angry, no one will be able to save him.”

The experts from the ancient past mocked.

To them, Bing Shan was unbeatable.

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, only Emperor Thirteen, who had awakened not too long ago, could match him.

They thought that both Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were no match for Bing Shan.

Jian Wushuang became serious when he saw the ice blades flying towards him.

“This man is really strong!”

He held Blood Mountain Sword in his hand as he prepared himself.

Bing Shan stared at Jian Wushuang with his emotionless eyes. Suddenly, a flash of fierce radiance burst forth from his eyes.

Whoosh!

Bing Shan moved.

His body was three meters tall and was extremely well built. Even so, he was incredibly fast.

As he moved, terrifying tsunamis of blade essence crashed forth. Crash~~~

Him not radiating his blade essence was a choice. When he did, it shocked the world.

“This sword essence... It is really powerful!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The moment Bing Shan attacked, Jian Wushuang knew immediately that Bing Shan’s understanding of the Blade Doctrine was far deeper than his understanding of the Sword Doctrine.

This was to be expected. After all, Bing Shan was an expert one step away from Master of Holy Land. He must have entered the Blade Doctrine Realm. Even under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the blade essence he could use was definitely much more than Jian Wushuang, who was only at initial success in the sword doctrine realm, could.

Hum!

Bing Shan swung his blade.

His blade swung in a straight line.

A shiny blade light lit up.

The moment the blade light appeared, whatever spacetime there was in this Heaven and Earth was frozen. The Might of Heaven and Earth then started fusing with the blade light.

The blade light then became even brighter and longer. It seemed endless.

In one moment, there was only one blade light in front of Jian Wushuang. In the next moment. The entire space in front of Jian Wushuang became saturated with blade lights.
