Chapter 1851: A Tossed Stone Raises A Thousand Ripples

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

There was a high possibility that the Star Palace Master had died!

After this piece of news was spread to the Vientiane Tower, it was further spread to the whole Eternal Chaotic World in an instant.

A tossed stone had raised a thousand ripples.

The Sanctuary Alliance and the experts in all the powerhouses of the Eternal Chaotic World burst into an uproar at once.

Of course, after getting the piece of news, many experts doubted the authenticity of it right away.

After all, many people knew how frightening the Star Palace Master was.

Although he was ranked thirty in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, if he were to go crazy, only Great Emperors could stop him.

How would such a powerful existence die so easily?

Moreover, even the Vientiane Tower said that there was a high possibility that he had died. This meant that the Vientiane Tower was unable to confirm it for real, probably because of the fact that no one had seen him dying nor seen his body. It was just a guess.

As it was only a guess, it was naturally unable to convince everyone.

However, the basis for such a guess from the Vientiane Tower was indeed worth pondering about.

Firstly, there was no news from the Star Palace Master. No matter who tried to contact him, there would be no reply.

This point had already been proven to be true. When quite a number of experts who possessed the transmission token of the Star Palace Master had obtained this piece of news, they tried to contact the Star Palace Master right away. However, there was no reply and this was the same for the people who were extremely close to the Star Palace Master.

Moreover, it was said that one of the Great Emperors from the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance had tried to contact the Star Palace Master personally. However, there was no reply as well.

This meant that the Star Palace Master was definitely in an extremely dangerous situation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to not reply even to his good friends or a Great Emperor when one tried to get into contact with him.

However, this alone was still not enough to confirm that the Star Palace Master had died. After all, there were some places with special spacetime in the Ancient Mystery Land where it would be normal for him to be uncontactable.

Next, the Vientiane Tower mentioned the unusual activities of the Lineage of Star over the past few years. In particular, Jian Wushuang’s wanton massacre. With that, they made a guess and this had really caused many people to harbor suspicions.

Indeed, for the past few years, the Lineage of Star had been unusual.

For so many years, they had put up with the existence of enemies. However, ever since the Star Palace Master became uncontactable, they started to hunt down those enemies wantonly?

There was Jian Wushuang, who was extremely talented. Previously, he had remained silent and laid low for six thousand years. However, without any warnings, he had displayed his talents abruptly again. This was really challenging other people’s level of tolerance toward him. In the Sanctuary Alliance, there were probably many people who did not wish to see him growing to such a frightening state. Hence, it would be best for him to remain silent and lay low during this period of time. As for revealing his talents of his own accord, that was considered stupid.

Why would Jian Wushuang choose such a stupid path?

Moreover, for the past few years, the Lineage of Star had been secretly using all kinds of techniques to recruit some experts. Although there were no agreements made during the recruitment, the Lineage of Star indeed had the intention to recruit experts.

By adding all these factors together and thinking about it many times, it could not help but make many people suspect if the Star Palace Master had really died for real?

…

Colored Glaze Sanctuary, inside the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Emperor God Tian Xiao and the remaining Almighties in the Soaring Heaven King Palace had gathered together.

“All of you have probably heard about the news,” Emperor God Tian Xiao looked down. “According to my predictions, there is indeed an extremely high possibility of the Star Palace Master being dead.”

“Great!”

The large number of Sir Gods below revealed delighted expressions.

It should be known that when the Star Palace Master went on a killing spree many years ago, some of the experts that he had killed were from the Soaring Heaven King Palace as well.

Back then, a grudge was born between the Soaring Heaven King Palace and the Lineage of Star. After that, when the Soaring Heaven King Palace had fought with Jian Wushuang, they had suffered heavy losses. By adding this new grudge to the old enmity, the Soaring Heaven King Palace then detested the Lineage of Star greatly. After getting to know that the Star Palace Master had died, they were naturally elated. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Palace Master, with the Lineage of Star losing the intimidation of the Star Palace Master, all the powerhouses will definitely come together and attack them. With that, our Soaring Heaven King Palace will be able to take revenge!” Sir God Qing Fu clenched both his fists tightly and said.

“Let’s not rush things,” Emperor God Tian Xiao shook his head, “Big brother has still not returned yet. Before we can confirm that the Star Palace Master has really died, we should not act recklessly. After all, if the Star Palace Master really goes crazy, he will be extremely frightening. Before big brother returns, the Soaring Heaven King Palace is absolutely unable to stop him.”

“Let’s sit back and wait first. We shall think about it after the news has been confirmed. Before that, we only need to make preparations to take action.”

“Alright.”

Many people below nodded their heads earnestly. However, their hearts were filled with excitement that was difficult to conceal.

…

Red Dragon Sanctuary, Evil Light Divine Sect.

“Dead. That old bastard is finally dead?”

An unusually evil, purple-armored youth, who was more than three meters tall, gave an earth-shaking roar and his voice resounded across the hall.

At the bottom of the hall, tens of experts were gathered and they were extremely excited as well.

“It’s great that he has died. It’s really great that he has died!”

“Back then, this old bastard killed a total of four Almighties of our Evil Light Divine Sect in one ago. Moreover, even the previous Sect Master died in his hands. This is the greatest humiliation that our Evil Light Divine Sect suffered ever since we were founded. However, it’s a pity that our Evil Light Divine Sect has always had no way to take revenge. However, now… he’s finally dead!”

“Although he’s dead, the Lineage of Star that he founded is still there!”

“Kill, kill. Sect Master, let’s take action immediately and destroy the Lineage of Star!”

The eyes of some people were scarlet in color and they were filled with murderous intent.

“Let’s not rush things.”

The unusually evil youth waved his big hands, “We must definitely avenge Master. Also, we must get rid of the humiliation that our Evil Light Divine Sect has suffered. However, it is still too early now. Although the Vientiane Tower has spread the news of the Star Palace Master dying, there are still some disputes. As such, there needs to be another step of confirmation to determine whether the Star Palace Master is dead or alive. Before that, we cannot act recklessly!”

“Wait, we have to wait!”

“Let’s wait until someone is unable to control themselves and take action first. After waiting for the news to be confirmed, it will still not be too late for us to take action!”

“From now on, get someone to monitor each and every action of the Lineage of Star tenaciously!”

The unusually evil youth’s orders were made known to the lower levels quickly.

…

The whole Sanctuary Alliance was already seething with excitement and many old bastards who had secluded themselves from the world were shocked by this piece of news.

As for the Lineage of Star, they naturally obtained this piece of news immediately.

In a secret room in the Sword Star, Jian Wushuang was still trying to raise the level of his Force of Soul.

After so many years, his Force of Soul had risen slightly.

Just then…

“Palace Master, there’s trouble!” Hall Master Yuan sent a message over and his voice was filled with anxiety.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes at once. After that, he went out of seclusion straight away.

In a hall which contained a vast void, Jian Wushuang and the other three Hall Masters were seated.

The expressions of the four of them were extremely ugly.

Jian Wushuang’s hands were holding on to a token and the token contained a piece of news that the Vientiane Tower had spread at a shocking speed.

As he looked at the piece of news in the token, Jian Wushuang sighed lightly, “What should come has finally come.”
