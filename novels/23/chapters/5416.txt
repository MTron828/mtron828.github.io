Chapter 5415 ¬†Suppress, Seal¬†

One careless move, and Mo Qian was cleaved by Jian Wushuang's sword, landing on the island below and shattering the already small isle.

Gong Miaoyi stepped out of the Time Pavilion.

Observing the outside world without making a move, she stood side by side with Bai Junwang, watching Jian Wushuang engage in combat with the tier 5 Emperor.

Her strength had surged again, breaking through to the level of a tier 5 Emperor.

¬†Moreover, she was not an ordinary tier 5 Emperor. She possessed an extraordinary Eternal Treasure.

She had initially intended to shake off these pursuers.

However, she noticed that Bai Junwang's strength had increased too rapidly, now reaching tier 6.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang hadn't experienced much growth.

She couldn't understand why, with such a disparity in strength, Bai Junwang still listened to Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang appeared within her Origin Source, she understood. She thought Bai Junwang was also threatened by Jian Wushuang.

"Suppress!"

Jian Wushuang held the sword in both hands, closing his eyes slightly.

In this moment, he and the sword became one. It was simple to solidify the word with the sword, but much harder to achieve the opposite.

Kun Tai, who emerged from the ruins, was somewhat astonished but managed to display his full strength.

He transformed his hands into blades and headed straight for Jian Wushuang.

Facing this fierce strike, Jian Wushuang remained motionless.

It was about to reach him.

Bai Junwang grew anxious and loudly exclaimed, "Should I intervene?"

Gong Miaoyi, on the side, was also surprised. She hadn't expected Jian Wushuang to go to such lengths.

Clearly, he was pushing himself to the limit, seeking a breakthrough.

"Suppress!"

Just as the palm knife pierced his forehead, he angrily shouted, then opened his eyes.

Jian Wushuang exchanged glances with Mo Qian, revealing a sneer.

"Seal!"

Crack!

Mo Qian's body began to solidify, and at the same time, a surprised expression appeared on his face.

Everything froze at this moment.

Jian Wushuang hadn't even made a move; there was just a glance containing a significant amount of Sword Intent.

At the moment Mo Qian solidified, he had already fallen.

Hoo!

Bai Junwang watched anxiously, finally exhaling a breath.

The Ultimate Sword Dao breakthrough.

Jian Wushuang was excited; it was not just a simple breakthrough. He had made a qualitative leap in his understanding of the Sword Dao.

Suppress and seal!

The two words had similar meanings, and the purity sought by the Sword Dao was also related to this.

In fact, Jian Wushuang didn't need to overthink or pursue more. A slight change in perspective was enough.

Suppression and sealing!

In one breath!

The eighth level of the Ultimate Dao was far from as simple as Jian Wushuang had thought. The closer he got to the realm of perfection, the more he experienced.

Jian Wushuang faintly felt that behind suppression and sealing, two more words were needed.

In the future, he could slowly deduce based on these two words.

Descend slowly to the ground, looking at the young man who had been knocked unconscious. Jian Wushuang pointed at him, directly awakening him.

Opening his eyes and glancing around, he didn't have time to stand up. He hurriedly crawled backward, but Gong Miaoyi's sleeve enveloped him, pulling him back.

"Speak up!"

The gazes of the three were cold.

These people obviously knew them and had come with a purpose.

Jian Wushuang had a bad feeling deep in his heart. These people were clearly not strong individuals from the Mo Luo Nation.

Why would they be searching for them? Even if they had offended the Mo Luo Nation, everyone knew that Gong Miaoyi possessed an extraordinary Eternal Treasure; it shouldn't drive them to such madness!

The terrified young man trembled, too scared to offer any resistance, and spilled out everything he knew.

As Jian Wushuang and the others listened, the situation seemed increasingly absurd.

"A sky-high bounty? Even tier 6 Emperors are involved!" Gong Miaoyi's eyes were profound, but there was a dimness in their gleam.

An Eternal Treasure of top-notch quality was indeed extremely precious. When a tier 5 Emperor went mad, even a tier 6 Emperor would pursue.

However, it shouldn't have reached the point of alarming the entire Western Sea!

The Western Sea was vast, and there were numerous Eternal Treasures. Almost every tier 6 Emperor possessed one.

What was even stranger was that even the inheritors had been stirred.

Gong Miaoyi, in her past weaker state, knew little about the matters of inheritance. But Jian Wushuang was well-informed!

In the past, inheritors were indeed impoverished, with only Emperor Fengyu possessing an Eternal Treasure throughout the entire Original Universe.

However, since they went to the Grave God Mountain, these people had experienced significant improvements.

Wuliang Buddha, once belonging to tier 3, had now reached the peak of the tier 4.

Moreover, they could now confront tier 5 top-level Emperors directly. Even those without top-notch Eternal Treasures had peak Eternal Treasures on their persons.

The scale was by no means small.

It was said that more than one Inheritor had appeared this time. It was estimated that several tier 5 Emperors had arrived, as otherwise, they wouldn't be able to contend with tier 6 Emperors.

It's just that Jian Wushuang doesn't know who they are.

Jian Wushuang frowned and glanced at Bai Junwang, transmitting his voice, "Ask the people from Kui Organisation what's going on!"

Right now, he hated being hunted down the most. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

His eyes moved, and with just one glance, he suppressed the tier 4 Emperor on the ground, turning his remains into powder.

Gong Miaoyi revealed a hint of astonishment.

When Jian Wushuang entered her body, she discovered that Jian Wushuang was different from an Emperor.

Although his Origin Source was powerful, there was still a difference compared to an Emperor.

In her view, Jian Wushuang's Origin Source was more like that of a Dao Lord.

Jian Wushuang ascended into the air and said lightly, "Let's go, it's not suitable to stay here for long; we've already been exposed!"

According to the tier 4 Emperor, Mo Qian must have informed those tier 6 Emperors.

If they didn't leave soon, those tier 6 old monsters would arrive.

Being able to make tier 6 Emperors join forces, they probably had a huge agenda, maybe relying on some treasure to quickly find them.

"Follow me!" Bai Junwang seemed to have sensed something, waving his hand and directly enveloping Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi, tearing through space and entering the gap.

Flying amidst the chaotic flows of space.

Crossing the sea in a single step.

Jian Wushuang transmitted quietly, "How's it going, did you find out?"

09:48

"This time it's not simple; Lord Shen Ling informed us. We're supposed to go to Qing Mang Island; someone is waiting for us there."

Bai Junwang's expression also became serious.

His message had just been sent out when the response from Shen Ling arrived, indicating that there was indeed a divine plan behind all this.

This time, it seemed they had gotten involved in a significant matter.

Jian Wushuang was quite shocked upon hearing the connection to Shen Ling.

Originally planning to scheme against Luo Sha, it appeared that the plan needed to be adjusted.

Bai Junwang's Origin Source had already been successfully refined, and the karmic ties had been resolved.

As long as Bai Junwang restored his strength, he could help Jian Wushuang obtain the Beast God Weapon.

Of course, this was the worst-case scenario.

Jian Wushuang preferred to personally strive for it.

Once he obtained the components of the Beast God Weapon, he had no need to stay in the Earth Realm. Instead, he could go to the Heavenly Realm, find Wu Zuo in the Elder Palace, and have him send him to Grave God Mountain.

If he knew that Shen Ling wanted him to go to Grave God Mountain by himself, it probably wouldn't be so easy.

Indeed, plans couldn't keep up with changes.

His original plan was to merge with the Dao at Grave God Mountain. However, if he really wanted to search for Grave God Mountain in God's Tomb, there was simply no opportunity to do so without merging with the Dao. There, the most terrifying Special Life Forms existed.
