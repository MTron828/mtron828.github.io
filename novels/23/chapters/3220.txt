Chapter 3221: Challenging Di Hao

——

“You are Di Hao?” The demonic man stared at Di Hao.

“Who are you?” Di Hao glanced coldly at the demonic man.

“My name is Su Yi, but I prefer to be called Wing King.” The demonic man laughed coldly, “I knew there were countless experts in the Blood Wave Realm. Unfortunately, I haven’t met a decent opponent in the Blood Wave Realm for a few days. Now, I finally meet an expert on the True Saint Ranking.”

“Di Hao, I want to challenge you!”

The voice of the demonic man, Su Yi, reverberated through the entire void, causing the experts hiding in the surroundings to hear it clearly.

They had all heard Su Yi’s name, and at the same time, they had also heard Su Yi’s challenge.

“Who is this Su Yi?”

“Wing King Su Yi? I’ve never heard of him.”

“He’s probably a reclusive expert. However, since he dares to directly challenge Di Hao, he should have some ability.”

The surrounding people were all looking forward to it.

The Blood Wave Realm had only opened for a few days, and there was still some time before the Blood Wave Token came into being. Before the Blood Wave Token came into being, there were so many experts gathered in this central area, and there were definitely some who wanted to spar with each other.

This was especially so for the challenges on the True Saint List. Many previously unknown experts with extremely powerful strength wanted to become famous by challenging the experts on the True Saint List.

And this Su Yi was now directly challenging Di Hao.

“To challenge me, you must first be prepared to die.” Di Hao said coldly.

“Haha, since I dare to challenge you, I will naturally be mentally prepared. If you really have the ability, you can directly kill me.” Su Yi laughed heartily, “Cut the crap, look at the saber!”

Su Yi did not waste any more words. After Di Hao accepted the challenge, he directly pulled out the blood-colored battle saber on his back.

Clang!

The saber was unsheathed, and a trace of blood light instantly lit up the sky.

As Su Yi raised the saber, a large amount of blood light instantly swept out and occupied the void, making the entire world seem to sink into a blood-red world. And in this blood-red world…a shocking killing intent suddenly rose.

“This Su Yi, what a strong killing intent.” Jian Wushuang stood around and watched. When he saw Su Yi waving the saber, a trace of shock flashed in his heart.

This terrifying killing intent alone showed that Su Yi’s strength was extraordinary. He had definitely grown up from a bloody storm. However, for some reason, he was not famous at all.

Whoosh!

A saber light suddenly descended. The moment it descended, the shocking killing intent and the surrounding blood-red color all gathered in the saber, making the blood-red saber light exceptionally dazzling and bright.

“Hmph!”

The blade light attacked, but Di Hao only let out a cold snort as he swung the huge ax in his hand.

It was a clean and neat strike, but the instant it was swung out, the world rumbled. The huge ax shadow seemed to have split apart the world as it appeared in front of the resplendent blood-red blade light. After that, the two collided head-on.

Bang!

With a loud bang, endless divine might form waves of shock waves that swept wildly in all directions.

After the loud bang, Su Yi’s figure instantly shot out.

Clearly, in this head-on collision, Su Yi was at an absolute disadvantage.

Bang!

With a loud bang, Di Hao was like an unrivaled Demonic God, easily tearing through the air and killing his way out. He once again appeared in front of Su Yi, and then the second ax descended.

This ax seemed to be able to split the sky and split the earth. It was incomparably domineering!

All the surrounding spectators could sense an unstoppable force and might from this ax.

Su Yi’s pupils suddenly shrunk. Immediately, a bloody glow erupted from his body.

“Demon slaughterer!”

Su Yi let out an explosive cry. He held the blade with both hands. The blood-colored battle blade in his hands suddenly expanded to a hundred feet in length. A monstrous might swiftly gathered within the battle blade. After which, he swung it once again.

Clang!

Another low collision sound rang out.

This time, Su Yi was still directly sent flying. However, Di Hao’s body also trembled slightly, and then he took two steps back.

“Hmm?”

Di Hao’s expression changed slightly. Clearly, he did not expect that he would be forced back by his opponent. A fierce glint could not help but flash past his eyes, and in the next moment, he abruptly took a step forward.

Space exploded and Di Hao appeared in front of Su Yi once again. Following that, he raised the huge ax in his hands.

Buzz!

A pitch-black ax shadow suddenly condensed in the middle of the battlefield. An unprecedented destructive aura also spread out from this ax shadow.

The moment this ax shadow formed, the gazes of all the surrounding experts who were watching the battle were instantly attracted by this ax shadow.

This ax shadow gave him a feeling that he could not block it.

It was invincible!

Jian Wushuang, Qian Hongzi, and the others looked at each other in dismay.

They knew this ax.

Although it was not Di Hao’s strongest ax, which combined the two principles of destruction and space-time, when they first met Thunder God, Di Hao had used this ax to knock him back.

Even Thunder God, who was ranked sixth on the True Saint Ranking, would be in a sorry state when faced with this attack, but this Su Yi…

Boom!

Although Su Yi tried his best to use his strongest attack in an attempt to block this attack, his blade light was instantly destroyed by that ax shadow, and then his entire body was drowned by that shocking ax shadow.

Weng weng! A terrifying power exploded in the center of the battlefield, and only after a long time did it regain its calm.

When everything calmed down, the crowd looked over and saw Su Yi standing in the center of the battlefield, his body slightly trembling. His body was covered in a layer of blood-red armor, however, at this moment, a crack appeared in the middle of the blood-red armor. As for the god power aura on his body, it had been reduced by 10%.

“You received three strikes from me. Your divine body hasn’t collapsed yet. Your strength isn’t bad.” Di Hao coldly glanced at Su Yi, but he had already put the giant ax back on his back. Apparently, he did not plan to attack again.

As for Su Yi, his expression was somewhat unsightly. He deeply glanced at Di Hao and did not say anything else. He directly turned around and left.

The moment Su Yi left, the surrounding void instantly became noisy.

“He lost. This Su Yi still lost!”

“It’s normal for him to lose. After all, he challenged the ranked eighth on the True Saint List, Di Hao.”

“This Di Hao is too strong. Especially that final strike he used. I feel that his strength isn’t as simple as the eighth-ranked on the True Saint List. He might even have a chance to break into the top five. Although that Su Yi was defeated by Di Hao, he was able to take three of Di Hao’s strikes head-on, yet his divine body didn’t collapse. He can be considered extremely powerful.”

Many experts were discussing this quietly.

Not many people were surprised by the result of this battle. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But the five people from the Temporal Temple stood together with a playful smile on their faces.
