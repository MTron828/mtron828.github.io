“Just as I expected. To deal with such a speedy and agile spirit beast, Waterdrop Sword Essence is the most suitable way.”?Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Raising the sword and churning up a wave, Jian Wushuang appeared right in front of the Demonic Cloud Leopard.

The Demonic Cloud Leopard’s maroon eyes fiercely shrank. It waved its claws, barely managing to block the sword. But the sword move suddenly changed, using Fiery Wind Sword Essence and fiercely stabbing right through its body at an amazing speed.

“Puff!”

The Demonic Cloud Leopard’s body hit the ground with its aura fading. It was already dead.

This caused a large uproar up in the air.

“Waterdrop Sword Essence?!”

“That boy has such high comprehension in Waterdrop Sword Essence?”

“He has shown his comprehension in the Earth, Gale, and Raging Fire Sword Essences, even managing to combine the Gale and Raging Fire Sword Essences. But who could have expected?that he also comprehended Waterdrop Sword Essence?”

“Mastering four kinds of sword essence at the same time?!”

Even those top-class experts were a little stunned.

Mastering two Essences is usually the limit for most warriors. Mastering three is considered the true limit. Then what does mastering four essences mean?

“This kid comprehended four sword essences. So bold.” Palace Master White repressed a sigh of admiration, with no hint of blame in her eyes.

She had recognized long ago that Jian Wushuang was a super genius who was far beyond the average. Thus, he could not be judged using ordinary standards.

“His comprehension of Waterdrop Sword Essence is so profound that he was able to transition from it to the Fiery Wind Sword Essence. He could have killed that Demonic Cloud Leopard earlier. So, why did he wait until now?” Palace Master Black asked, then shook his head while smiling.

At the top of the mountain.

Right after killing the Demonic Cloud Leopard, Jian Wushuang squatted down to collect the core. But right when he squatted down...

“Clap! Clap! Clap!”

The sound of clapping rang out abruptly. Jian Wushuang’s face stiffened. He looked over to where the sound was coming from and saw two figures walking slowly towards him.

“It’s them.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes constricted.

He knew the two men. He had encountered one of them before.

“It’s Ouyang Haoyue and his big brother, Ouyang Haotian”?,?Jian Wushuang scratched his nose.

The two men coming towards him were exactly Ouyang Haotian and Ouyang Haoyue.

Ouyang Haoyue had been holding a grudge against Jian Wushuang.

The reason why Jian Wushuang ranked tenth on the Earthly Dragon List, so to speak, was that he defeated Ouyang Haoyue.

At that moment, Ouyang Haoyue had said that when the selection of battle began, he would return twice the disgrace he got from Jian Wushuang.

“The Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard had battle strength close to the Profound Yin Void Realm. And you killed it by yourself. Your strength really is outstanding,” said Ouyang Haotian, who wore a gloomy smile with coldness in his eyes.

“What do you want?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ouyang Haotian, with a frosty expression on his face. He directly ignored Ouyang Haoyue.

“With your strength, I wouldn’t normally be interested in fighting with you for that core. But, there is bad blood between you and my little brother, and I can’t pretend I don’t know about you bullying him,” Ouyang Haotian said.

“Jian Wushuang, I told you over a month ago, that I will return what I got from you that day twofold. And the time for that is today,” Ouyang Haoyue roared with hatred.

“You’ll return it to me twofold? With just the two of you?” Jian Wushuang looked indifferent.

“Not the two of us. I alone am enough,” Ouyang Haotian said, with a hint of absolute confidence in his smile.

Jian Wushuang looked over at him.

Not long ago, Ouyang Haotian had defeated Mu Yingying, who ranked 3rd on the Earthly Dragon List, and took her place on the list. His strength was undoubtedly formidable.

But Jian Wushuang wouldn’t bare him in mind with such a battle record.

What surprised him was, why is Ouyang Haotian so confident?

“Why don’t you come and try.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, and the sword essence that once ceased was explosively surging from his body again.

“Hehe, I won’t let you down”, just as Ouyang Haotian’s voice spread out, his figure rushed forward.

He appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, with a streak of ice-cold light suddenly shining. He was holding a long pitch-black spear, its head glittering with a metallic luster under the sunshine, incomparably dazzling. Soundlessly, the long spear thrust towards Jian Wushuang.

“Waterdrop and Earth Essences...” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

He recognized the Waterdrop and Earth Essences. Not only that, they were combined together.

Obviously, Ouyang Haotian was also an absolute genius who could combine two essences.

Among the 68 geniuses who participated in the selection competition, there were no more than five who had achieved the combination of two essences. Ouyang Haotian was one of them.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang sneered and chopped out with his Triple-kill Sword, straight from the sheath near his shoulder.

SHUA... It cut through the air.

The sword’s edge landed directly on the ice-cold spearhead, with the Fiery Wind Sword Essence bursting to its limit.

Pia!

A blast roared. The long pitch-black spear tilted, but it quickly thrust out like poisonous snake’s tongue. Shiu! Shiu! Shiu!

Whips of spear shadows stabbed toward Jian Wushuang in rapid succession, with each of the shadows aimed directly at his throat.

Jian Wushuang, leisurely and unhurried, fended off the spears with the Reincarnation Sword Skill.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!...

The sound of continuous clashes burst out. The spear shadows were extremely fast and attacked at tricky angles, forcing Jian Wushuang to keep retreating.

Dozens of spears thrust out. Although all of them were blocked by his Reincarnation Sword Skill, Jian Wushuang has forced back tens of feet, until he finally crashed into a giant tree on the mountaintop.

Crack!

The giant tree, tens of meters high, exploded from the center.

Jian Wushuang managed to regain his balance, then brushed the wood chips off his shoulder. He roused his strength, instantly causing the muscles and bones in his body to make loud cracking sounds. Then, Jian Wushuang looked toward Ouyang Haotian, his voice was cold and hard as he said,” Ouyang Haotian, please don’t tell me this is all you’ve got.”

“Oh?” Ouyang Haotian raised his brows and said,”It’s true that the strength I just showed is not a threat to someone like you, who killed a Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard by himself, so...”

And intense light flashed in Ouyang Haotian’s eyes, then his body rushed forward like lightning.

The ice-cold spear shadow pierced through the air like an electric drill,?instantly appearing in front of Jian Wushuang.

“The same spear move?” Jian Wushuang looked indifferent.

It seemed to be the same as the first move Ouyang Haotian demonstrated just a moment ago because the essence comprehension in the move was being suppressed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While, still being cautious, Jian Wushuang immediately chopped toward the spear shadow with his Triple-kill Sword.

However, when the spear shadow collided with the Triple-kill Sword...

“What?”

Jian Wushuang’s face changed immediately.
