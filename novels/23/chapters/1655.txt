For example, the black-robed, arrogant old man and the plump, bald-headed young man had already travelled many times in the inner layer of the Eighth Lair. Moreover, they also stayed in the inner layer for quite a long period of time for every trip. However, up till that moment, they had never obtained a Grade Three Demon Core before.

However, at that moment, they saw a Grade Three Demon Core appearing in front of them and it was being put into someone else’s Qian Kun Ring. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“A Void Real God?”

“This person is the genius Jian Wushuang from the Lineage of Star.”

The two of them recognized Jian Wushuang instantly.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two of them stopped at a short distance away from Jian Wushuang and their eyes started to scan the surroundings.

They could tell that an intense battle had just taken place at their location. Moreover, they also see the body of the Three-Horned Star Demon, which was badly damaged.

“Could Jian Wushuang have killed that Three-Horned Star Demon?” the bald-headed young man frowned.

“He is the only person here. Hence, he must be one who killed it. However, we do not know how he managed to do it,” the black-robed, arrogant old man was squinting his eyes.

The two of them were a bit late and they were unable to witness the scene of Jian Wushuang killing the Three-Horned Star Demon. Thus, they questioned the method that Jian Wushuang had used to kill the Three-Horned Star Demon.

After all, while Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator with an extremely high level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way that was said to be able to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace, he was still a Void Real God in the end. Moreover, he was just a Void Real God who had just made a breakthrough recently.

How could a Void Real God kill a Three-Horned Star Demon that both of them were helpless against?

Unless they saw it with their own eyes, they would not believe it, even if they died.

“A Grade Three Demon Core.”

The black-robed, arrogant old man was licking his lips, “The higher the level of a Demon Core, the higher its cost. A Grade One Demon Core is worth about two Doctrine Gems. However, a Grade Two Demon Core is worth about eleven to twelve Doctrine Gems. As for a Grade Three Demon Core…”

“I have heard that someone had wanted to trade a hundred Doctrine Gems for a Grade Three Demon Core. However, no one cared about him. After all, only idiots would use Grade Three Demon Cores to trade for Doctrine Gems. As Grade Three Demon Cores contain a great amount of pure power, if they were used to manufacture elixirs, the elixirs would definitely be able to recover a Chaotic Real God’s Divine Power fully in a short amount of time. Hence, if the elixirs were used properly, it would be the same as having an extra life.”

“However, it’s a pity that the Grade Three Demon Core has landed in the hands of Jian Wushuang,” the bald-headed young man shook his head.

“Xue Ling, have you realized that the space that we are in is completely cut off from the outside world?” the black-robed, arrogant old man said abruptly.

“Eh?” the bald-headed young man was stunned and he tried to communicate with the outside world immediately. However, he realized that his message could not be sent out.

“I see.” The bald-headed young man’s eyes turned grave and he looked toward the black-robed, arrogant old man at once, “What are you trying to say?”

“What do you think? Why did both of us decide to team up back then?” The black-robed, arrogant old man laughed coldly, “This Jian Wushuang has obtained a Grade Three Demon Core. Moreover, he is also the apple of the Lineage of Star’s eye as well as a top genius. Therefore, he is full of treasures. If we were to kill him, our gains…”

“However, isn’t he someone who is able to kill a Three-Horned Star Demon?” the bald-headed young man was a bit hesitant.

“Haha. Do you really think that a Void Real God can kill a Three-Horned Star Demon?” The black-robed, arrogant old man sneered, “In any case, I don’t believe it. Also, even if we are unable to kill him, we can just leave immediately. What can he do to us?”

“You’re right.” The bald-headed young man nodded his head and made up his mind, “Since that’s the case, let’s do it.”

“I had been waiting for you to say that,” the black-robed, arrogant old man’s eyes became gloomy and cold.

Their simple conversation only lasted for a short while. Moreover, they had set up a seal intentionally during their conversation. As such, Jian Wushuang did not know what they were talking about.

Of course, Jian Wushuang realized that something was amiss from their actions. However, he was still not in a rush to leave.

“Real God Xue Ling and Real God Gu Ying of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. The two of them are normal Chaotic Real Gods. Even if they were to team up, they would not be a threat to me. I really wish to see what the both of them plan to do,” Jian Wushuang floating at his position quietly and he had nothing to fear.

At that moment, the black-robed, arrogant old man and the bald-headed young man finally finished their conversation. Their eyes then looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Congratulations, Jian Wushuang. You have actually obtained a Grade Three Demon Core,” the black-robed, arrogant old man known as Real God Gu Ying laughed. His face was also filled with graciousness.

“I was just lucky.” Jian Wushuang was neither haughty nor humble, “What about the two of you? Even though both of you are Chaotic Real Gods, both of you teamed up. Aren’t both of you thinking too highly of the Star Demons in the inner layer?”

“Haha. Both of us just happened to run into each other and we will split up soon,” Real God Gu Ying laughed. He then said firmly straight away, “Jian Wushuang, I have a presumptuous request and I hope that you will agree to it.”

“Tell me the request,” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold.

“I want the Grade Three Demon Core that you have and I am willing to use ten Doctrine Gems to exchange for it. Deal?” Real God Gu Ying said while laughing.

“Ten Doctrine Gems? No problem,” Jian Wushuang grinned. With a flip of his hands, the Grade Three Demon Core appeared on his hands, “The Demon Core is here. Real God Gu Ying, you may come over and take it.”

Without standing on ceremony, Real God Gu Ying headed toward Jian Wushuang immediately.

However, at the moment where he appeared in the void, less than a hundred meters away from Jian Wushuang –

Swish!

All of a sudden, a brilliant sword light appeared. The sword light was not just dazzling. Under the influence of the Power of Spacetime, it pierced through the void and headed for Real God Gu Ying’s head.

“Hmph, I knew that you would do this,” Real God Gu Ying was not surprised in the slightest. He then extended his big hands and grabbed the sword light with his strength.

The void twisted open and the sword light that Jian Wushuang unleashed exploded when it was crushed.

Jian Wushuang could not help but retreat a few steps and his laughter was filled with ridicule, “If the both of you wish to snatch my Grade Three Demon Core away from me, just say it openly. There is no need to be so hypocritical.”

“Hypocritical?” Coldness and gloominess flashed past Real God Gu Ying’s eyes, “Xue Ling, let’s attack together and kill this little kid!”

“Alright,” Real God Xue Ling who was at the back nodded his head and his powerful aura was unleashed instantly.

At that moment, the two Chaotic Real Gods revealed their strongest abilities right away.

A giant, ancient black hammer could be seen appearing on Real God Gu Ying’s hands. Moreover, the black giant hammer also contained bits of Thunderbolt Power. After Real God Gu Ying gave a cry, the black giant hammer expanded instantly. Rustle~~~ The giant hammer was accompanied by an infinite amount of Thunderbolt Power and it headed toward Jian Wushuang as though a Thunder God had descended.

As for Real God Xue Ling, he was holding a crimson long spear tightly. When he swung the long spear, a great amount of Divine Power appeared and blood mist which could cover the whole sky spilled out instantly. The blood mist then gathered in the void and changed into crimson giant dragons after a short while. There was a total of nine crimson giant dragons and they attacked at the same time with shocking power.
