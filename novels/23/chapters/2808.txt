Chapter 2809: Marquis of Three Yin

(It’s the fifth watch today!)

——

Many experts of the Sword Alliance glared at the cold man standing there.

Only Elder Tong, Great Divine Master Jue Xin, Elder Snake, and the others could sense that this person’s strength seemed to be extraordinary, so their expressions were somewhat solemn.

“Who are you?” Elder Tong stared at the cold man.

“Marquis of Three Yin.” The cold man spoke slowly.

Marquis of Three Yin?

Upon hearing this name, many experts of the Sword Alliance felt that this name was extremely unfamiliar. Elder Tong had been in the Pill Sun Continent for so many years. He should know which experts there were in the Pill Sun Continent, but he had never heard of an expert called Marquis of Three Yin.

“May I know why you have come to our Sword Alliance?” Elder Tong asked.

“I’m here to see Sword One. Are you Sword One?” The cold man, Marquis of Three Yin, looked at Elder Tong.

“No, I’m not.” Elder Tong shook his head.

“Then I have nothing to say to you. Just hand over Sword One and tell me,” said Marquis of Three Yin.

“My League Master is in closed-door cultivation. Just no one can see him. So please leave,” said Elder Snake.

“Oh, you are not willing to show yourself?” Marquis of Three Yin smiled indifferently. “Since I have come here personally to meet him, I will have to meet him even if he doesn’t want to.”

“Sir, you have a big mouth.” Elder Tong’s expression sank. The aura of a peak great deity erupted from his body in an instant and directly pressed toward the Marquis of Three Yin.

“Sir, it is best for you to leave quickly. Otherwise, this old man will not be courteous.” Elder Tong said in a deep voice.

“You won’t be polite? With just you?” The Marquis of Three Yin glanced at Elder Tong, a hint of contempt flashing across his face.

“You’re courting death!” Elder Tong naturally saw the change in the Marquis of Three Yin’s expression and immediately became furious.

In an instant, Elder Tong directly turned into a bolt of lightning and charged toward the Marquis of Three Yin with endless power.

But the moment he appeared in front of the Marquis of Three Yin...

Buzz!

The Marquis of Three Yin’s body slightly swayed. Before Elder Tong and many experts of the Sword Alliance could react, they discovered a palm had already slapped onto Elder Tong’s divine body.

“What?”

Elder Tong’s face turned pale with fright. The terrifying power from that palm also caused his divine body to tremble crazily.

“Pu!”

A large mouthful of blood directly spurted out of Elder Tong’s mouth, and his body shot backward like a cannonball.

When he regained his balance, Elder Tong’s face had turned pale, and the aura on his body had been greatly weakened.

He widened his eyes and stared at the Marquis of Three Yin in shock.

The surrounding experts of the Sword Alliance also waited quietly.

Elder Tong was a Peak Great Divine Master, but he was heavily injured by the Marquis of Three Yin in just the blink of an eye. What kind of strength was this?

“Sword One!”

Marquis of Three Yin’s voice rang out again. His voice reverberated in the world.

“Are you still not coming out? If you don’t come out, your subordinates will die!”

The echoes continued to echo for a long time.

Jian Wushuang had been cultivating in a secret chamber in the deepest part of the underground of the Sword Alliance’s base. Finally, he had reached the pinnacle of his understanding of sword principle and space-time rules.

He had already reached this step when he created the ultimate skill. He was trying to master it.

But at this moment... Marquis of Three Yin’s voice was heard.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly and slowly opened his eyes.

Then he moved and disappeared from the secret chamber.

In the void above the Sword Alliance’s lair, Jian Wushuang appeared out of thin air.

As soon as he appeared, he saw the Marquis of Three Yin standing not far in front of him.

Looking at the Marquis of Three Yin, Jian Wushuang could not help but narrow his eyes.

Although the Marquis of Three Yin did not exude any aura and seemed ordinary, Jian Wushuang could feel tremendous pressure from him. The pressure was so great... it was even greater than when he faced Palace Master Nan Wu.

“Since when did such a powerful expert appear in the Pill Sun Sacred World?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Then he noticed Elder Tong, whose aura was weak.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Alliance Master, this expert called Marquis of Three Yin suddenly came here and called you by your name. He wanted to see you. We knew you were in seclusion, so we wanted him to leave. But he didn’t want to, so Elder Tong attacked him. Of course, we didn’t expect the Marquis of Three Yin to injure Elder Tong in one move seriously,” Snake Elder said respectfully.

“You seriously injured Elder Tong in one move?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He also knew Elder Tong’s strength.

If it were him, he would have to use all of his trump cards in order to seriously injure or kill Elder Tong.

However, the Marquis of Three Yin did not use his full strength at all. It was just an understatement, but he still managed to do it.

The strength of the Marquis of Three Yin...

“Who are you? Why are you here?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Marquis of Three Yin with his hands behind his back.

Although the Marquis of Three Yin was very powerful and gave him a lot of pressure, Jian Wushuang was not afraid.

“Are you Sword One?” The Marquis of Three Yin glanced at Jian Wushuang and said, “Sure enough, you are just an Advanced Divine Master.”

He praised the Marquis of Three Yin and said seriously, “I came here today because I heard that a great genius expert appeared in the Pill Sun Sacred World. He was just an Advanced Great Divine Master, but he killed Palace Master Nan Wu. I was curious about you, so I came here to meet you.”

“Just meet me?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“Of course not. If possible, I would like to kill you, a genius.” The Marquis of Three Yin grinned.

Hearing this, the experts of the Sword Alliance narrowed their eyes and became extremely vigilant. They looked at Marquis of Three Yin with anger.

Even Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

“If you want to kill me, let’s see if you have the ability to do so,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Why don’t you give it a try?” The Marquis of Three Yin sneered, and his ordinary aura finally began to erupt.

Rumble...

This aura was earth-shaking!

Although it was still at the Divine Master level, it was several times stronger than ordinary Divine Masters, or even Peak Great Divine Masters.

The aura stirred up the wind and clouds, and even Jian Wushuang’s face became more serious.

Without a doubt, this aura was the strongest Divine Master’s aura that Jian Wushuang had ever seen! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang instantly recognized the identity of the person in front of him.

“Invincible Divine Master!”

“Marquis of Three Yin is a real Invincible Divine Master!”
