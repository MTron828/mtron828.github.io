Chapter 558: A Mysterious Compass

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Sword Emperor, hear me out.” Temple Master Iceberg started telling his story.

“Golden Snake was a junior of mine, and I once gave him a token. It might not have any value, but it means a lot to me. Now that Golden Snake has died and the token is in your hands, I was hoping that you would return it to me.”

“Of course, I’ll satisfy any condition you have for returning it to me,” Temple Master Iceberg said sincerely.

Jian Wushuang pondered over what to do after hearing these words.

“A token?”

“Why does he value this token so much?”

“What token are you referring to?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s a compass. I think it’s in Golden Snake’s Interspatial Ring,” Temple Master Iceberg answered.

“A compass?” Jian Wushuang asked and smiled. “Temple Master Iceberg, you know that I’ve just experienced a life-death duel and haven’t been able to check the ring yet, so I have no idea if the compass is in the ring.”

“How about I go back first and search through the ring carefully? I’ll reply to you if I find it, ok?”

There was an imperceptible surprise in Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes, but he still nodded. “Fine. Then, I’ll look forward to hearing your reply.”

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded and left.

As he watched Jian Wushuang’s retreating figure, the gentle and smiling expression on Temple Master Iceberg’s face suddenly became deadpan, then a sliver of light flashed in his eyes.

“This boy is quite alert.”?Temple Master Iceberg clenched his fist.

“Maybe I was too impatient and aroused his suspicion. In the following days, it would be better to wait patiently for his reply.

“The more impatient I behave, the more suspicious he will be.”

Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes became even more chilling.

He was determined to get the compass because it was related to the Ancient World Token.

“Whatever it takes, I have to get that compass.”

After leaving Temple Master Iceberg’s place, Jian Wushuang immediately found an empty secret chamber and began to check Emperor Golden Snake’s Interspatial Ring.

There were many treasures in the ring, including two Rank Nine Monster Cores.

After a careful search, Jian Wushuang found the compass.

It was yellow, rusty, and about the size of a palm, with a chip on the edge that made it seem even more ancient.

The compass was made of the same ordinary materials that were used in making magic weapons.

“Is this the compass Temple Master Iceberg wants?”?Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Since this compass is something that Temple Master Iceberg values so much, it should be more extraordinary. I don’t understand why he apologized to me just to get this item.”

Jian Wushuang observed the compass and found nothing special about it.

The compass was very common both in its look and material.

Nobody would even notice it if it were in a market.

“Could it be that the secret lies inside the compass?”?Jian Wushuang pondered and then submerged his consciousness into the compass.

Normally, important information was recorded inside Jade Slips and tokens, so it required one to read them using their consciousness.

However, it turned out that Jian Wushuang was wrong. He could read nothing inside the compass.

“What’s wrong with it? Were Temple Master Iceberg’s words about the compass being just a normal and useless token, true? He wants it just because it has a special meaning to him?”?Jian Wushuang was rather confused.

However, he quickly turned down that idea.

“If it is a special token, why did he give it to Emperor Golden Snake?

“There must be some secrets hidden in the compass that I failed to notice.

“Whatever, the compass is mine now. Temple Master Iceberg has nothing to do with it.”?Jian Wushuang put the compass back in the ring.

The next moment, he began studying the Slaughter Dao.

Because of the Six-story Pagoda, he had made progress in comprehending the Slaughter Dao, which was proven to be much more powerful than Emperor Golden Snake’s Phantom Saber Principle.

He even found the Slaughter Dao more powerful than the Waterdrop Sword Principle, which Emperor Fengxiao studied, the Illusory Sword Principle, which Su Ming studied, and the Heart Sword Principle, which Blind Emperor studied.

Those people might have a better comprehension in the principles than Jian Wushuang did, but in terms of pure power, the Slaughter Dao surpassed them all.

While those principles were a mixture of the Origin and Sword Principle or Saber Principle, the Slaughter Dao came from purely from the Origin. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With his doubt in mind, Jian Wushuang immersed himself in studying.

As Jian Wushuang was digging into the Slaughter Dao, the news of him killing Emperor Golden Snake and becoming a Divine Emperor in the Monster-exterminating League spread throughout the human populations, as well as the entire continent.

His name, Sword Emperor, was memorized by everyone.

He was the only Divine Emperor who was in the Saint Realm on the Monster Continent.

Along an unbroken ridge in Human Territory, there was a vast palace hidden underground.

In that palace, a black-robed elder was reading the latest intelligence with squinted eyes.

“Sword Emperor? Jian Wushuang?

“As a Saint Realm expert, he is as powerful as a superior emperor?

“What an impressive kid. Human beings really can be talented! Luckily, he is an outsider from another plane world, so he’s not likely to be a threat to us even if he grows more powerful someday. Otherwise, we would have to eliminate such a peerless genius as soon as possible.”

The elder’s words revealed his identity.

He was a monster spy who had slipped into the human population.

The palace he was in was an important information station for those monster spies.

“Well, Emperor Golden Snake, since you were a Divine Emperor who died at the hands of another human, you really saved us a lot of trouble.”

The elder continued reading the information regarding the life-death duel between Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake.
