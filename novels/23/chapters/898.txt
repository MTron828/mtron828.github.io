Chapter 899: Before Departing

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When he heard Lord Spirit Sound, Jian Wushuang couldn’t stop his expression from changing.

After all, he did have a few friends on Star Island.

Like Ling Long, who had entered the Stellar Fog Sea with him and had even been through some life and death situations with him.

Then, there were also Qian Yu and Zi Dong. He had a good relationship with Qian Yu, while Zi Dong had sparred with him many times and even helped him out over the years.

If possible, he wanted to bring these three out with him when he left the island.

But, of course, the rules of Star Island were not that easy to break.

“If you want to bring them with you, there is a way. However, it will be quite difficult for you,” Lord Spirit Sound suddenly said and smiled.

“Are you referring to the fourth Black Tower?” Jian Wushuang asked.

There were actually four Black Towers on Star Island.

The first three black towers were there to test Divine Realm experts, Eternal Realm experts, and Dao Masters, but the fourth tower had always been a mystery.

However, there was a rumor on Star Island that whoever conquered the fourth tower would be able to control the Stellar Fog Sea.

“Regarding the rumor on Star Island about the fourth Black Tower, it is not exactly wrong. That tower is about the final test on Star Island,” replied Lord Spirit Sound, before continuing, “I mentioned to you before that passing the first three towers means you can become an ordinary disciple of Star Bloodline, but that only means to be an ordinary disciple.

“However, the fourth Black Tower…”

“The person who founded the Star Bloodline set the rules that anyone who can pass the test in the fourth tower can become a true disciple of Star Palace and will be able to enter it.

“Meanwhile, that person will also gain control of the entire Stellar Fog Sea, which also means he will gain control of Star Island.

“If you successfully pass the fourth Black Tower and become a true disciple of Star Palace, whether or not the people on Star Island can stay or go will be completely up to you.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then asked, “What realm was the fourth tower created to test?”

“Well, it definitely has a very high requirement, much higher than your current level, so you still have a long way to go before your cultivation reaches that point. In the future, once your strength has improved enough, Gu King will let you know,” Lord Spirit Sound said with a laugh.

“I still have a long way to go?”?Jian Wushuang sighed helplessly.

After all, he was still quite young. He had cultivated for less than a thousand years, so it was already incredible for him to have reached his current level.

As for the strength required to defeat the fourth tower, he was not there yet, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be strong enough in the future.

“Oh, there is one other thing.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Spirit Sound and continued, “When I entered the Stellar Fog Sea 200 years ago, there were four of us. Shui Jin died and Ling Long entered Star Island with me, but I never did find out what happened to Jiu Zui. Do you, Lord Spirit Sounds, possibly know his whereabouts?”

“The other person who came with you?” Lord Spirit Sound frowned and shook his head. “I am in charge of Star Island, but I have no control over what happens in the Stellar Fog Sea, so I don’t know where Jiu Zui is now, the person who came with you. However, since it’s been over 200 years now and he has not entered Star Island, it’s highly likely that he is already dead.”

“He is dead?”?Jian Wushuang frowned while sighing to himself.

In the beginning, he had entered the Stellar Fog Sea along with Jiu Zui, Ling Long, and Shui Jin, but only he and Ling Long had survived.

Moreover, Ling Long was not strong enough to pass the test of the Black Tower, so it would be a very long time before she was able to leave. She could even be trapped here for the rest of her life. Jian Wushuang was the only one with enough talent and luck to be able to leave.

Among the four, he was the luckiest.

“Do you have any other questions?” Lord Spirit Sound asked, with his hands behind his back and a patient expression on his face.

“There is nothing else. But, before I leave, I want to go back to Star Island and tie up a few loose ends. Is that okay?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That is fine.” Lord Spirit Sound nodded slightly. “However, whether you are on Star Island and in the Stellar Fog Sea or not, you can not reveal any information regarding the Star Bloodline or Star Island to anyone, no matter who they are.

“I will place a strong restriction on your body. If you tell anyone, the restriction will activate. Unless someone stronger than me steps in, you will definitely die.”

After that, Lord Spirit Sound flicked his wrist and Jian Wushuang was instantly surrounded by a red light.

When facing Lord Spirit Sound, Jian Wushuang was completely unable to fight back, so he could only accept it as the red light entered his body.

“A restriction??” He could not help but smile bitterly.

Before entering the Stellar Fog Sea, there had already been a restriction placed on him by Emperor Leng. Now, while leaving the Stellar Fog Sea, another restriction was being placed on him.

“Okay, you can go”

Lord Spirit Sound made a simple motion. Then, in front of Jian Wushuang, a wormhole appeared out of thin air.

Jian Wushuang stepped into the wormhole and immediately returned to Star Island.

Back on Star Island, Jian Wushuang had passed the third Black Tower test in front of everyone. When news of this spread, everyone on Star Island was completely shocked.

Everyone on the island was very excited.

After all, the Stellar Fog Sea had been around for a long time, and only one person had ever left alive to date. The odds of leaving here were just too low.

Because the odds were so low, the people on Star Island didn’t see any hope for the future.

Maybe they were already very desperate.

But, now that Jian Wushuang was preparing to leave, the hope that was buried deep in their hearts had been rekindled.

“If Blood Mountain can pass through the third tower, why can’t I?”

Almost everyone had this train of thought.

In front of the Black tower, stood a crowd of people who were waiting for Jian Wushuang to reappear. But, even after such a long time, he still had not come out. Everyone understood that he had probably left with Lord Spirit Sound and possibly even exited the Stellar Fog Sea already, so these people could only slowly disperse.

Inside Jian Wushuang’s courtyard on Star Island.

Everyone who had an excellent relationship with Jian Wushuang was gathered here. Ling Long, Zi Dong, and Qian Yu were all gathered here, with Jian Wushuang sitting in the middle.

“Blood Mountain, congratulations.” Zi Dong stared at him with a burning look in his eyes that was very deep, yet possessed a hint of envy.

Before the arrival of Jian Wushaung, he had been the person who was the closest to passing the third test. No one expected Jian Wushuang, who had only arrived recently, would only need 200 years to completely surpass him. Not only that, he even took the lead and passed the third tower.
