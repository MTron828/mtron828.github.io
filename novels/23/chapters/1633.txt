After pausing for some time, King Gu Tong continued talking: “Your Master is supposed to be extremely weak. However, he was able to appear in that ancient battlefield and also stop the corrosion from the sinister power in time for me. It must be known that this sinister power caused even a Peak Seven-star Royal Ancient God like me to give up all hope.”

“Moreover, after interacting with him for a period of time, I have a feeling that he is very closely related to that ancient battlefield. It is even to the extent that I suspected that he was a consciousness body that was left behind by a peak expert who died on that battlefield!”

“Of course, this is only my guess and I am not sure whether it is true.”

As Jian Wushuang listened, his expression became even more grave.

He knew that his own Master was a mystery.

At the same time, the battlefield that his hometown was in contained shocking secrets.

However, no matter what the secrets were, he would be unable to search for them with his current abilities.

In the end, his abilities were still too weak.

“Even a top Seven-star Royal Ancient God like King Gu Tong has treated that battlefield as a nightmarish place. From this, it can be seen how dangerous that battlefield is. Hence, if I want to search for the secrets of that battlefield, at the very least, I need to possess the abilities of an Almighty before I have the right to do so. In order to make everything clear, I might have to become even stronger!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with a strange expression. However, he was extremely firm like never before.

No matter how much further he had to go before being able to find out everything to answer his own questions, he would still do his very best to fight for it.

After all, that secret was related to too many things.

It was related to his Master who he respected the most and who he was greatly indebted to.

It was related to the survival or extinction of his hometown, the Green Fire World.

It was related to the infinite number of living things in the Green Fire World which included many of his loved ones and good friends. In addition, it was also related to everything else.

He would definitely make everything clear one day.

However, at that very moment, he was still very far away from being able to do that.

“Boom!”

All of a sudden, a fierce, booming sound could be heard. With that, Jian Wushuang and King Gu Tong, who were in the palace, were alarmed.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“This should be done by the Asura Tribe. Those people are really persistent,” King Gu Tong shook his head and laughed.

“Asura Tribe? What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“It has not been long since I returned to the Ancient God Sanctuary. Moreover, after I returned, I settled down there as a tribe. In addition, quite a number of experts, as well as King Gu You, the current ruler of the Gu King City, also knew that I returned. However, my abilities never recovered and it was not convenient for me to show myself. Thus, over the past few years, no matter who came to see me, I rejected all of them.”

“As time passed by, the news of my abilities having deteriorated leaked out. However, this piece of news was never confirmed. As such, the Asura Tribe came to provoke us repeatedly,” King Gu Tong laughed.

“They are testing you?” A thought flashed through Jian Wushuang’s mind and he understood.

As some of the top experts in the Gu King City were unable to confirm whether King Gu Tong’s abilities were at their peak, they got the Asura Tribe to step in and provoke him repeatedly. With just the Ancient Gods under King Gu Tong’s lineage, they would naturally be unable to compete against the Asura Tribe. Thus, King Gu Tong would be forced to take action.

As soon as King Gu Tong took action, his abilities would be revealed immediately.

“The Asura Tribe is merely a normal Ancient God tribe outside the Gu King City and their strongest expert is just a Stage Three Six-star Ancient God. If there is no one supporting them, they will not have the guts to provoke me even if they knew that my abilities have deteriorated.” As King Gu Tong spoke, his eyes unleashed an infinite amount of light which could put extreme pressure on anyone.

Indeed. He was a top Seven-star Royal Ancient God. Even if his abilities were to deteriorate, as long as he was not dead, no one would dare to act impudently in front of him.

Even if they were to pluck up some courage, the Asura Tribe, which was ruled by a Stage Three Six-Star Ancient God, would not dare to find trouble for him.

As for who was supporting the Asura Tribe behind their back, Jian Wushuang had a good idea of it.

“Jian Wushuang, moments ago you mentioned that you cleared the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower?” King Gu Tong looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Since that’s the case, please help me out and send the Asura Tribe away,” King Gu Tong said.

“No problem.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and he stood up immediately. After that, he bowed to King Gu Tong and walked out of the palace.

As soon as he left the palace, Jian Wushuang could hear the booming sound that was coming from the void outside the tribe continuously. It was obvious that some experts were fighting over there.

Moreover, by looking at the Divine Power which had been spread all over the void, the abilities of the two people who were fighting were not weak and they should be Six-star Ancient Gods.

Swoosh!

With a flash of his body, Jian Wushuang hurried toward the battlefield.

At the void outside the tribe, there were a great number of people and they were all Ancient Gods under King Gu Tong. At that very moment, they were looking at the battlefield in front of them worriedly.

Elder Yi was also within the crowd.

“Elder Yi.” Jian Wushuang appeared beside Elder Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, you have come.” Elder Yi glanced at Jian Wushuang.

Beside them, quite a number of clansmen also noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence.

“Elder Ying and Brother Gu Yang, long time no see,” Jian Wushuang greeted some of the people who he was once familiar with. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Jian Wushuang, it’s actually you?”

When those acquaintances saw Jian Wushuang again, all of them could not help but cry out in alarm.

It should be known that they had not seen Jian Wushuang for tens of thousands of years and they thought that Jian Wushuang had died previously

When they saw him again, they naturally could not help but gasp.

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang looked toward the battlefield in front of him.

Within the battlefield, two shadows had revealed their Ancient God bodies. They were both Six-star Gold-armored Ancient Gods and Jian Wushuang knew one of them.

“Gu Heng?” A thought flashed pass Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Back then in the Eternal Zone, Gu Heng was a genius of the Ancient God Clan which he came across.

The Eternal Zone was a mystery land. Moreover, the Ancient Gods were under huge restrictions in the Green Fire World and it was difficult for them to display their abilities. Hence, even their speed of improvement was extremely slow.

However, ever since those Ancient Gods returned to the Ancient God Sanctuary, their abilities skyrocketed. For example, at that moment, Gu Heng had already become a Six-star Ancient God. Although he was only a Stage One Six-star Ancient God, he was considered one of the top few among the Stage One Six-star Ancient Gods. In addition, his Bloodline was extremely pure and he had cultivated some Ancient God Unique Skills before. As such, even though he was facing a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God at that moment, he was able to fight an intense battle with him for a long period of time.

“Although Gu Heng’s abilities and his mastery of the Ancient God Unique Skills are not too bad, it is a pity that the gap between the power of a Stage One Six-star Ancient God and a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God is too huge. For him to be able to fight against the Stage Two Six-star Ancient God for some time, it is already considered good. However, in the end, the results will be…” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

As expected. After a short while, Gu Heng was defeated.
