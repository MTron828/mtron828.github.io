Chapter 2956: A Head-on Battle

——

The blood-red river surged in the sky. A faint dark-gold light surrounded the surface of the river and instantly filled the entire world. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The nine-universe blood-light river, star-armor domain, and punishment prison had all been activated.

Under Jian Wushuang’s full effort, the three domains pressed crazily on the Star Sea Saint.

“A domain-type holy treasure?” Star Sea Saint’s eyes shone with a dark light. “A Divine Master has such a treasure. Not bad.”

“What else do you have? Bring it out.” Star Sea Saint looked at Jian Wushuang calmly.

Jian Wushuang was too lazy to answer. After his battle strength had reached its peak, he directly attacked.

Whoosh!

His figure burst forth as if he had teleported.

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the Star Sea Saint. He held his sword with one hand and slowly raised it. Then, he made a slash.

This slash seemed to be an understatement, but in fact, the moment it was made, Jian Wushuang’s sword essence and the power of the boundless sword tree in his body had been exerted to the maximum. Buzz, buzz, buzz. A large number of space-time rules condensed with the sword essence, time-space blades condensed.

There were more than 400 densely packed time-space blades, and these time-space blades had completely merged with the sword essence.

The space-time rules and swordsmanship were perfectly combined!

Boom!

A fierce wind suddenly swept up between heaven and earth, and a huge sword-edge storm completely covered the void where the Star Sea Saint was.

“The power of this sword doesn’t seem weak.”

The Star Sea Saint looked calmly at the sword-blade storm, but a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

He flipped his palm, and an ancient giant hammer appeared in his hand.

This giant hammer probably weighed hundreds of millions of pounds, and its surface was surrounded by faint earthy-yellow energy. As the Star Sea Saint raised his right hand, the giant hammer was also raised high.

Endless power of the laws of the earth began to gather in the Star Sea Saint’s hand.

“Heaven and earth split!”

The Star Sea Saint shouted in a low voice, and the giant hammer in his hand instantly fell down.

It was a giant hammer that weighed hundreds of millions of kilograms, but when the giant hammer fell down at this moment, it was like a sharp battle knife. With incredible power, it instantly split the storm of sword blades, then, the overwhelming power crushed the sword essence in the sword storm.

After the huge hammer fell, a visible crack appeared in the world.

This crack was very obvious.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang rolled and shot backward. He retreated a long distance and finally stopped.

After stopping, he looked up at Star Sea Saint again with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

“So powerful!”

“This power is too powerful!”

Jian Wushuang praised in his heart.

“Boy, is this all you can do?” Star Sea Saint looked at Jian Wushuang coldly with a giant hammer in one hand.

“Humph!” Jian Wushuang snorted and communicated with the Blood Mountain Sword with his mind.

Buzz!

A shocking sword essence suddenly burst out!

This sword essence was not very powerful, but it was extremely extraordinary.

It was a supreme sword essence that carried a shocking will.

The sword essence swept across the world, and all the people in the world were ants.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword tightly and felt the supreme sword essence that burst out of the Blood Mountain Sword. Millions of people in the world had to submit to this supreme sword essence. At this moment, he was the king of millions of sword principles.

“This sword essence… is so strong!”

The Star Sea Saint’s pupils constricted, and his expression gradually became serious.

The supreme sword essence had been guided, and Jian Wushuang’s battle strength instantly soared.

“Again!”

Without any unnecessary words, Jian Wushuang stepped forward again.

He directly appeared in front of the Star Sea Saint, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand had already been silently slashed out.

This sword did not display any overly shocking sword techniques, but under the sweep of that Supreme Sword Intent, the void was easily torn apart by the sword light, and the air was torn apart. A majestic sword light brought with it a supreme aura, it suddenly swept toward the Star Sea Saint.

Facing this sword, even the Star Sea Saint did not dare to be the slightest bit careless.

At this moment, he held the giant hammer in both hands. The earthen yellow energy gathered in the sky, and the giant hammer in his hands suddenly expanded in size. It struck out like a small mountain.

Boom!!

The giant hammer swept across the void, and the void seemed to be unable to withstand his power. It trembled crazily and let out a low rumble.

In the blink of an eye, the giant hammer and the Blood Mountain Sword collided again.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

He still felt a great pressure from the giant hammer.

Even though he had channeled the supreme sword essence and his battle strength had soared, the power contained in the giant hammer seemed to be stronger than his.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang staggered backward.

“Boy, no matter how strong your skills are, in front of me, in front of absolute strength, it’s futile!” Star Sea Saint’s voice was cold. He waved the giant hammer and intended to chase after Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang pointed at him while he was retreating.

“Buzz!” The power of endless space-time rules swept out.

Heaven-designated skill!

With Jian Wushuang’s current comprehension of space-time rules and the power of divine power, this move could be of great use to those below the True Saint realm. However, against a genuine True Saint who was at the peak of rank one… the effect of this move was negligible.

However, no matter how weak the effect was, it still made Star Sea Saint pause slightly.

At the same time, streams of black light rushed out and formed a two-meter-long pitch-black divine sword in the blink of an eye.

The pitch-black divine sword contained the power of endless reincarnation rules. As soon as it formed a line, the world around it immediately turned white.

It was a vast expanse of whiteness, completely reduced to a world of ice and snow.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang let out a low cry. The pitch-black divine sword suddenly attacked, aiming straight at the head of Star Sea Saint.

However, before the black divine sword actually appeared in front of Star Sea Saint’s head, he had already broken free from the heaven-designated skill.

“Humph!”

With a cold snort, the Star Sea Saint swung the giant hammer in his hand.

When the hammer hit the black divine sword, it was immediately sent flying. Even the black divine sword was trembling crazily as if it was about to collapse.

“Although the power of the reincarnation sword formation is powerful, it is still performed by the sword formation itself. Without the supreme sword essence of the Blood Mountain Sword, its power can not affect the Star Sea Saint, who has reached the peak of the first level of the True Saint realm. However, it doesn’t need to cause too much of an impact. As long as the reincarnation sword formation is perfectly coordinated with my own swordsmanship, the Star Sea Saint won’t be able to do anything to me.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

As soon as he stood still, he burst out again like a bolt of lightning.
