“I want an elixir. As for Chaos Gems, it wouldn’t be a problem,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If so, please follow me to the secret room for further discussion,” Universe God Mo Yan said.

“Secret room?” Jian Wushuang was happy but he wore a poker face, “Sure.”

“Please,” under the lead of Universe God Mo Yan, Jian Wushuang walked into the secret room in the interior of the shop.

On the way, Jian Wushuang took out a token secretly.

The token was a mirror token, specially used to record the mirror image.

The mirror image was also the item that Jian Wushuang used to prove that he had completed the task alone.

Universe God Mo Yan led Jian Wushuang and they arrived at the secret room. There was a glimmer of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and his Soul Power covered the surroundings. He instantly determined that it was the best time for him to take action.

“Universe God Mo Yan,” Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Huh, how did you know my name?” Universe God Mo Yan turned around in surprise.

Just as he turned, a silent soul light pierced into him without any sign.

Too fast, and they were too close to one another.

Universe God Mo Yan couldn’t respond at all. The soul light hit his consciousness and destroyed his consciousness easily, like breaking dead wood.

Universe God Mo Yan stared but didn’t make any sound. His body was still standing but never fell. However, his aura had already dispersed.

“Success!”

Jian Wushuang tightened his grip.

Just as he had expected, Universe God Mo Yam’s consciousness strength was of a normal standard among Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. He performed the second layer of the secret skill of Tian Yuan with his all, Inextinguishable Light and under the condition that caught Universe God Mo Yan by surprise, it was not possible for him to block the attack.

His consciousness was destroyed directly.

After he killed Universe God Mo Yan, Jian Wushuang took away his Qian Kun ring. Then he didn’t stay any longer in the private room, but left the shop directly.

Jian Wushuang looked calm as he walked to the entrance of the shop. The two attendants bowed at him politely but didn’t notice anything unusual. Jian Wushuang left the shop without hindrance.

“Everything was just as planned. As long as there’s no movement, there shouldn’t be anyone who notices Universe God Mo Yan’s death.”

“Before they react, I should already leave the place. They won’t be able to catch me in time.”

“The third part of the task isn’t as difficult as I’d imagined.”

Jian Wushuang smiled as he prepared to leave Sky Sword Mountain swiftly.

“Humph. How dare you kill in Sky Sword Mountain? You have guts!”

An angry bellow that seemed to be from out of the highest Heaven suddenly reverberated through Sky Sword Mountain. The voice was as loud as thunder and it shook all the cultivators in Sky Sword Mountain.

Rumble. A terrifying power instantly concentrated in the sky above.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

He lifted his head in shock and realized that there was a huge hand towering above his head.

The towering, huge hand was moving towards him slowly. It made Jian Wushuang feel as though his head was exploding and there was an unprecedented fear growing in him.

“It’s Almighty, it’s almighty!” The King of Venomous Worms’ voice and groan was suddenly heard in Jian Wushuang head.

“How is this possible?” Jian Wushuang was in disbelief.

He was confident that he had done it flawlessly. The Real Gods in Sky Sword Mountain has yet to notice Universe God Mo Yan’s death and he could totally escape. However, he had never expected that the Real God wouldn’t notice, but the most terrifying existence on Sky Sword Mountain, the owner of Sky Sword Mountain, would instead.

After the owner of Sky Sword Mountain found out, he took action against him immediately.

The Almighty took action on his own. Even Jian Wushuang felt hopeless.

In and out of Sky Sword Mountain, countless cultivators, including various Real Gods looked up in terror. All of them were staring at the towering hand.

“This is… the Almighty’s doing?”

“In Sky Sword Mountain, there’s only one Almighty, who is the owner of Sky Sword Mountain. Who is it? He provoked the owner of Sky Sword Mountain to take action himself?”

“Killing in Sky Sword Mountain? And caught by the owner of Sky Sword Mountain himself? Tsk tsk. This person is doomed!

Everyone was greatly astonished and pitied Jian Wushuang.

Rumble.

The towering hand slowly descended. It looked slow, but there was a feeling that soared up in Jian Wushuang that he couldn’t resist or avoid it.

He could only stand there and watch as he waited for the huge hand to eliminate him.

He had no power to struggle nor fight back.

“The owner of Sky Sword Mountain, I’m a disciple of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang shouted in madness. His voice spread across the entire Sky Sword Mountain.

It was Jian Wushuang’s last chance.

He could only hope for the owner of Sky Sword Mountain to be lenient because of the Lineage of Star.

“Humph, so what if you are the disciple of Star Palace? This is Sky Sword Mountain. No one has the right to violate my rules here in Sky Sword Mountain. However, as you are only a Universe God, I will not kill you. I will send you to Sky Sword Prison for you to perish!”

The magnificent voice reverberated in the universe once again.

After it was done, the towering hand suddenly increased in speed and clawed towards Jian Wushuang at lightning speed. Jian Wushuang had no power to fight back and he could only watch as the towering hand picked him up like a chick and threw him. There was a wormhole that appeared in the surrounding void and Jian Wushuang’s figure instantly drowned in the wormhole and disappeared.

After it did all that, the towering hand slowly dispersed and the magnificent voice wasn’t heard again. The entire Sky Sword Mountain resumed its silence.

However, the countless cultivators on Sky Sword Mountain, including the Real Gods, were still astonished.

“Earlier, when the hand descended, I felt like the sky was going to collapse, I had no intention to fight back. It was too scary.”

“Almighty, it’s an Almighty’s way!”

“The Universe God is imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison by the owner of Sky Sword Mountain.”

“Sky Sword Prison? Where’s that?”

“You don’t know? Tsk tsk. It is widely recognized by the nearby seventy-two Holy Kingdoms that it is the scariest place. Even the Real Gods would be petrified if they heard the name. A Universe God who is imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, I’m afraid he will stand no hope to get out of it. However, he was audacious enough to kill in Sky Sword Mountain, so he deserved it.”

The cultivators in Sky Sword Mountain continued to discuss among themselves. It only subsided after a few days.

Very soon, Sky Sword Mountain resumed its tranquility.
