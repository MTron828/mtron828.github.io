Chapter 2757: Nobody Will Rescue You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Who is it? How dare you attack the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s main lair?” An angry howl filled the entire sky before a huge amount of people came skimming out from the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s main lair.

The three people leading the way were Heavenly Blood Alliance’s three Grand Ultimate Gods. The person who yelled aloud was the Heavenly Blood Alliance Alliance Master who was a High-level Grand Ultimate God.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance Alliance Master looked with unprecedented anger at the person who activated the elusive saber-light.

“That’s... Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Alliance Master’s facial expression darkened.

He knew who Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was but the Heavenly Blood Alliance had never offended that Grand Ultimate God. However, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was attacking the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s main territory at that moment.

Hum!!

The crimson magic formation trembled violently but soon calmed down.

However, the elusive saber-light had already dispersed.

‘It didn’t break?’ Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s facial expression slightly changed but he took action once again.

Clank~~~

It was still an extremely elusive and scary saber-light that was much larger and stronger than the previous.

The saber-light once again hit on the crimson magic formation with the only difference being the crimson magic formation looked as though it was going to break.

“This is bad.” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Alliance Master’s facial expression darkened as he noticed the crimson magic formation had reached its limit.

Hum!

Finally, the entire crimson magic formation could not endure the saber-light’s horrendous strength and immediately fell apart.

Once the magic formation had fallen, the entire Heavenly Blood Alliance’s lair was exposed in the open.

“Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, good work.” A hearty laugh sounded as Jian Wushuang and the others skimmed over from the void they were located before landing beside Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

“These people...” Heavenly Blood Alliance Master only noticed Jian Wushuang and the others at that moment.

“Old Snake, An Ying, Lan Junzhu, and the person standing in the middle is... Su Han of the Sword Alliance?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master narrowed his eyes.

He recognized all those people standing in front of him and realized that Jian Wushuang was the person leading them. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Alliance Master Su Han, there seem to be no grudges between Heavenly Blood Alliance and Sword Alliance. What is the meaning of you bringing people here and destroying the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s important formation?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master looked at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

“Haha... There’s nothing special. I’m just taking a leisure walk at your Heavenly Blood Alliance and wiping it out while I’m doing that,” said Jian Wushuang with a soft smile.

“Wipeout our Heavenly Blood Alliance?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master’s facial expression darkened.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance’s many experts also had angry expressions on their faces.

However, right at that moment...

Boom!!

An explosion sound accompanied by a wave of strong divine power could be felt exploding directly from below them before sounds of angry yells from some experts could be heard.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master immediately looked toward the source of the sound only narrowed his eyes by what he witnessed.

“The spatial passage had been destroyed?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master’s facial expression darkened greatly.

At the same time, an overpowering aura wave also came skimming forward. It was a dirty and sloppy old man. The divine power coming off the sloppy old man had already reached the peak of a High-level Grand Ultimate God.

“Strange Old Tong, it’s you!!” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master and those many experts from the Heavenly Blood Alliance gritted their teeth as they said that.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance was secretly supported by the Divine Demon Sect with many of their experts originating from the Divine Demon Sect. The hatred between Strange Old Tong and the Divine Demon Sect was written very deeply in their blood.

“Heavenly Blood Alliance Master, it’s been a long time. I wish you well.” Strange Old Tong smiled coldly as he stared at the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master.

‘We’re in huge trouble.’ The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master had a darkened expression on his face.

Although the Heavenly Blood Alliance was one of the first-rated forces, they only had three Grand Ultimate Gods with him being the only High-level Grand Ultimate God.

However, the company that Jian Wushuang brought over apart from himself were a total of four High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and one Primary-level Grand Ultimate God which all of them were extremely strong.

It was absolutely easy for such a lineup to wipe out their members purely with higher combat power.

Apart from that, the spatial passage had been destroyed by the Strange Old Tong. Even if he immediately sent a message to the Divine Demon Sect, they would not be able to immediately send help. The Heavenly Blood Alliance’s situation was really worrisome.

“Alliance Master Su Han, it looks like your Sword Alliance has really made up your mind to take action against my Heavenly Blood Alliance?” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold look in his eyes.

“Of course, why would I gather such a big group of people if that isn’t the case,” said Jian Wushuang while smiling.

“Alliance Master Su Han, I’m sure you’re kept in the dark on the true origins of Heavenly Blood Alliance? Heavenly Blood Alliance is supported by the Divine Demon Sect. If you dare take action against us, the Divine Demon Sect will do their best to wipe out the Sword Alliance,” yelled the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master with a deep voice.

“Haha... Are you trying to scare me with the Divine Demon Sect?” Jian Wushuang could not help but scoff. “I certainly knew about the background of your Heavenly Blood Alliance before deciding to take action against you, so what about the Divine Demon Sect? I’m taking action against the Divine Demon Sect!”

“Heavenly Blood Alliance Master, listen carefully. The Heavenly Blood Alliance will be wiped out today and nobody will be able to save you! I mean by what I’ve said!!” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice could be heard throughout the entire Heavenly Blood City.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance experts’ facial expressions darkened when they heard that.

“Everyone, take action. Don’t let all three Grand Ultimate Gods of the Heavenly Blood Alliance go and kill all of those high-level experts. As for the others, kill those who fought back,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, Lan Junzhu, and Old Tong who were behind him looked at each other before taking action.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Five extremely strong auras immediately exploded as war instantly broke out.

“There’s hope as long as we are still alive. Let’s escape!” The Heavenly Blood Alliance Master immediately made his decision and exchanged looks with both Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods behind him before turning around to escape.

They knew there was a huge power difference between both parties. The three of them did not have any room to retaliate if they engaged so they could only escape.

As experts in the Grand Ultimate God level, they were really good at protecting their lives such that even a Grand Ultimate God more powerful than them would fail to make them stay if they really wanted to escape.

If they escaped at that moment and the Divine Demon Sect immediately took action after all that, they could easily have their revenge. Jian Wushuang and the others standing in front of them, including the Sword Alliance, would be completely wiped away after that.

However, Jian Wushuang had been thinking about preventing them from escaping since early on.

Therefore, the moment those three were prepared to make a move... Hum, hum~~ Great amount of golden light streams immediately extended.

The golden light streams’ expansion speed was so much faster compared to those three Grand Ultimate Gods escaping speed that those streams covered a great area of the void in the blink of an eye which also engulfed those three Grand Ultimate Gods. A golden light domain immediately expanded and suppressed them.

At the same time, the 10,000-foot-tall Golden God Shadow had already risen behind Jian Wushuang as he pointed his finger and formed the Prison of Punishment.
